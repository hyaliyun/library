The museum is located in Ostrzesz√≥w, Poland. Background A prisoner-of-war camp, Stalag XXI-A, was established in some of the town buildings in Schildberg, in Nazi occupied Poland during 1940. In 1943, the camp was renamed Oflag XXI-C for the imprisonment of 1,150 military officers transferred from Norway. On August 16, 1943 the German Wehrmacht arrested all Norwegian officers who were still in Norway. Of the approximately 1,500 officers who were detained, probably one third were sent home the following week because of age, illness, etc. The remainder were to become prisoners of the Nazis in Poland.  Beginnings  In 1982, Eyvind Grundt from Moss, Norway, was sent to Poland on a mission for the Norwegian Red Cross. After completing his work, he began a search for the town where his father had spent two years as a Prisoner of War (POW) during World War II. It was a difficult task, since he only knew the German name of the town, Schildberg. After many inquiries, Grundt found that Schildberg was a small Polish city of Ostrzesz√≥w. In Ostrzesz√≥w, by chance, he made contact with Lechoslaw Nowakowski, a language professor at the local college. Nowakowski had a good knowledge of the history of the town and shared Grundt's interest in the fate of the 1,150 Norwegian POWs once interned there at Stalag XXI-A. They discovered that Grundt‚Äôs father had been interned in the building that now houses the town‚Äôs largest technical school. In the cellar of the school, several Norwegian artifacts were discovered, including a dented tin plate engraved ‚ÄúKaptein Vagn Enger‚Äù. Grundt contacted the manager of the local museum, Josef Janas and they agreed to create a small Norwegian collection in the museum. Initially, it was in the right drawer of the manager‚Äôs desk.  Exhibits  Since 1982, a number of objects connected to the Norwegian POWs have been collected, in both Norway and Poland. Several special exhibitions to present them were arranged at first, but from 1996 onwards, the Norwegian collection has had a permanent exhibition area in the newly renovated Ostrzesz√≥w museum. The collection of objects continues, and the museum has developed into an information and competence centre concerning Norwegian POWs in general. The museum is engaged in collecting the abundant literature relating to the subject. What makes the Norwegian POW Museum especially unique is photographic collection of one of the former POWs of the Ostrzesz√≥w camp. After managing to smuggle a small camera into the camp, the prisoner used chocolate and cigarettes from his Red Cross parcels to ‚Äúbuy‚Äù film from the German guards. Thus he could document many aspects of POW life in a unique way. Many of his photographs have been enlarged and cover the walls in the museum. It is rather unusual to find a Norwegian museum far outside the borders of the country. The inhabitants of Schildberg (Ostrzesz√≥w) are proud of being able to display the unique history that they and Norway share. In 2003 more than 6000 persons visited the POW museum; including Polish and Norwegian families and individuals. The museum intends to publish several booklets covering the fate of the POWs. Information will also be published on the internet.  Scope  The museum covers the military POWs in the local Stalag XXI-A, as well as sub-camps of the Oflag XXI C (Oflag XXI-C in Schokken, Oflag XXI-C/Z in Grune bei Lissa and Stalag III-A and Oflag III-A of Luckenwalde). The museum has future plans to cover POWs in Stalag Luft III (Sagan) and Marlag und Milag Nord (Tarmstedt an der Timke). Later still, other groups of prisoners, such as interned civilians, police prisoners and students will be covered. Prisoners in KZ- and NN-camps, in hard labour camps and jails (political prisoners and ‚Äúcriminals‚Äù), as well as prisoners in Norway, will not be included.

It is written in PHP. In contrast to tools like PhpLDAPadmin the focus is account based and to give the user a more abstract view of a directory. This aims to allow people with little technical background to manage LDAP data. The base application is licensed under the GNU General Public License, and there is an extended version available under a commercial license.  History  The LDAP Account Manager (LAM) project was founded in February 2003. The first developers were Michael D√ºrgner, Roland Gruber, Tilo Lutz and Leonhard Walchsh√§usl. The goal was to create an application to manage Samba software accounts. At this time Samba supported LDAP in its 2.x releases and version 3 was at alpha stage. But there was no GUI to manage them. Until LAM version 0.4.10 only Samba accounts could be managed. In the year 2004 the project started to develop a plugin architecture to support more account types. The first stable release with the new code was LAM 0.5.0 in September 2005. There is a commercial variant (LAM Pro) since 1.0.4 that supports a user self-service (e.g. to change own password, telephone number, ...). It also supports additional LDAP objects (e.g. Zarafa, Kerberos, PPolicy, ...).  Features  The most important account types which are supported by LAM are Samba, Unix, Zarafa and PPolicy. The user can define profiles for all account types to set default values. Account information can be exported as PDF files. There is also the possibility to create users via file upload. It also includes the tree view of PhpLDAPadmin to access the raw LDAP attributes. LAM is translated to 16 languages. Supported account types: * Unix * Samba 3,4 * Kolab * Address book entries * Asterisk (incl. voicemail and Asterisk extensions) * Mail routing * IMAP mailboxes (non-LDAP, via IMAP protocol) * Hosts * FreeRadius * Authorized services * SSH keys * File system quota (in LDAP (systemQuotas) and via external script) * DHCP entries * NIS netgroups The commercial version also includes a user self-service.

The objective was to bring some charm \\"√† la fran√ßaise\\" to the market of men's magazines, following the success of Playboy in the United States, launched just a decade before. France, indeed, in the first half of 20th century had an outstanding reputation for erotic publications, feeding also foreign market and inspiring also ersatz French-flavoured magazines abroad, when, for example, US publishers used French-sounding titles like Ch√®re and Dream√© or placed tricolour flags on the covers, attempting to attract the casual buyer.Jacques Lanzmann ‚Äî Novelist, lyricist and editor of Lui, The Independent, 4 July 2006 It was anyway a semi- clandestine circulating material, not allowed to be freely displayed or openly bought. In this sense Playboy changed the way 'soft pornography' (become more respectfully 'adult entertainment'), can be publicly circulated. This magazine was particularly successful from its origins to the early 1980s, afterwards it began a long decline. It was published regularly until November 1987 (the final issue of this first series was the number 285). After 1987 there was a further attempt to relaunch the title but the publication ceased again in 1994. Passed into the hands of the media group of Michel Birnbaum, after a transient stimulus, it became a pornographic magazine with episodic dissemination. It was published every three months. After the purchase of the title by Jean-Yves Le Fur, Lui was relaunched on 5 September 2013 as a high- end magazine with Fr√©d√©ric Beigbeder at its helm. Lui published by Filipacchi group (1963‚Äì1994) =First series (1963‚Äì1987)= This magazine successful recipe was combining content with depth articles and beautiful naked women, featuring many B-List but also celebrities, often prominent French actresses, such as Brigitte Bardot, Mireille Darc, Jane Birkin or Marl√®ne Jobert. It featured a monthly pin-up by Aslan. The first girl to pose on the cover was Val√©rie Lagrange (the number 1 appeared on 11 January 1963) photographed by Francis Giacobetti, future director of the soft-core movie Emmanuelle 2. The magazine hosted also a cartoon by Lauzier: Les Sextraordinaires Aventures de Zizi et Peter Panpan. Among the first collaborators are Jean-Louis Bory, Ren√© Chateau, Philippe Labro, Francis Dumoulin, Francis Giacobetti, Sin√©, Michel Mardore, Gilles Sandier and many others. The magazine motto was Lui, le magazine de l'homme moderne (The Magazine of the Modern Man). In the beginning, it had also a mascot, a cat's head, similarly to the magazine Playboy Bunny, but it disappeared in the early 1970s. =Second series (1987‚Äì1994)= The second series was published by the Filipacchi group from 1987 to 1994. It has been published 69 numbers. Its editor was St√©phane de Rosnay in 1989, Brice Couturier 1990 to 1992. Initially, its specificity (compared to the first series) was that it was published in a two separate books, but from number 27, \\"\\"Lui\\"\\" returned to be a single book magazine with the new slogan \\"Le magazine de l'homme civilis√©\\" (The Magazine of civilized man). The circulation that was in early 1980 of 350,000 copies dropped to 70,000 copies in 1993. In early 1993, the magazine abandoned the monthly release and became bimonthly. The Filipacchi group stopped publication in June 1994. Lui published by Michel Birnbaum (1995‚Äì2010) =Le Nouveau Lui (1995‚Äì1997)= The title was taken from 1995 to 1997 (14 issues) and named Le Nouveau Lui by Michel Birnbaum, a radiotherapist physician turned publisher as founder and owner of the holding company Altinea, specialized in magazines about vintage cars.Place au ¬´Lui¬ª new-look. Le ¬´magazine de l'homme moderne¬ª va repara√Ætre ‚Äì Lib√©ration ‚Äì 21 September 1995 ‚Äì Philippe Bonnet The goal was to return to the basics (and success) of the primitive publication, intending a more glamour-oriented publication. The coverage of the first issue was dedicated to Miss Agnes. The magazine had again a monthly issue and the design of the title was upgraded. In this series, for the first time, the cover picture was devoted to one man alone, without accompanying female model. This attempt to revive the magazine failed. The final issue was published in February 1997 with Eva Herzigov√° as cover girl. =Lui pornographic magazine (2001‚Äì2010)= The magazine published quarterly from 2001 to 2010 had a pornographic nature. Its slogan was \\"L'officiel de la photo de charme\\" or (as on the online edition) \\"Le charme des filles d'aujourd hui.\\" It was published by the company 1633 whose president and sole shareholder is Michael Birnbaum. Patrick Gu√©rinet was the managing editor until 2010, when substituted by Francis Guillebon in July. Lui published by Jean-Yves Le Fur (2013‚Äì ) The magazine was relaunched in 2013 with L√©a Seydoux as its first cover girl. Its editor-in-chief was Fr√©d√©ric Beigbeder.

This concept, related to the work on communities of practice by Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger, refers to the overall set of various types of informal, emergent social networks that facilitate information exchange between individuals with practice-related goals. In other words, networks of practice range from communities of practice where learning occurs to electronic networks of practice (often referred to as virtual or electronic communities).  Basic concepts  To further define the concept, first the term network implies a set of individuals who are connected through social relationships, whether they be strong or weak. Terms such as community tend to denote a stronger form of relationship, but networks refer to all networks of social relationships, be they weak or strong. Second, the term practice represents the substrate that connects individuals in their networks. The principal ideas are that practice implies the actions of individuals and groups when conducting their work, e.g., the practice of software engineers, journalists, educators, etc., and that practice involves interaction among individuals.Lave, Jean, Cognition in Practice: Mind, Mathematics and Culture in Everyday Life, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988. What distinguishes a network of practice from other networks is that the primary reason for the emergence of relationships within a network of practice is that individuals interact through information exchange in order to perform their work, asking for and sharing knowledge with each other. A network of practice can be distinguished from other networks that emerge due to other factors, such as interests in common hobbies or discussing sports while taking the same bus to work, etc. Finally, practice need not necessarily be restricted to include those within one occupation or functional discipline. Rather it may include individuals from a variety of occupations; thus, the term, practice, is more appropriate than others such as occupation. As indicated above, networks of practice incorporate a range of informal, emergent networks, from communities of practice to electronic networks of practice. In line with Lave & Wenger's original work (1991), Brown & Duguid propose that communities of practice are a localized and specialized subset of networks of practice, typically consisting of strong ties linking individuals engaged in a shared practice who typically interact in face-to-face situations.Brown, J S & Duguid, P, Knowledge and organization: A social-practice perspective. Organization Science, 12, 2: 198-213, 2001. At the opposite end of the spectrum are electronic networks of practice, which are often referred to as virtual or electronic communities and consisting of weak ties.Vaast E. The Use of Intranets: The Missing Link between Communities of Practice and Networks of Practice? Chapter 18 in Hildreth, P & Kimble, C (eds.), Knowledge Networks: Innovation Through Communities of Practice, London: Idea Group Inc., 2004 In electronic networks of practice, individuals may never get to know one another or meet face-to-face, and they generally coordinate through means such as blogs, electronic mailing lists, or bulletin boards.  Distinguishing from formal work groups such as project teams  In contrast to the use of formal controls to support knowledge exchange often used in formal work groups, such as contractual obligation, organizational hierarchies, monetary incentives, or mandated rules, networks of practice promote knowledge flows along lines of practice through informal social networks. Therefore, one way to distinguish between networks of practice and work groups created through formal organizational mandate is by the nature of the control mechanisms. A second group of distinguishing properties refers to their composition. Networks of practice and formal work groups vary in terms of their size since networks of practice may range from a few select individuals to very large, open electronic networks consisting of thousands of participants while groups are generally smaller. They also vary in terms of who can participate. Work groups and virtual teams typically consist of members who are formally designated and assigned. In contrast, networks of practice consist of volunteers without formal restrictions placed on membership. Finally, networks of practice and formal work groups vary in terms of expectations about participation. In formal work groups and virtual teams, participation is jointly determined and members are expected to achieve a specific work goal. Participation in communities of practice is jointly determined, such that individuals generally approach specific others for help. In electronic networks of practice, participation is individually determined; knowledge seekers have no control over who responds to their questions or the quality of the responses. In turn, knowledge contributors have no assurances that seekers will understand the answer provided or be willing to reciprocate the favor.

Facts This case was a case stated by the Magistrates' Court sitting at the Castle in Chester on 19 July 1967. On 13 April 1967 an advertisement by the appellant (Arthur Robert Partridge) appeared in the periodical \\"Cage and Aviary Birds\\", under the general heading \\"Classified Advertisements\\" which contained, amongst others, the words Quality British A.B.C.R... Bramblefinch cocks, Bramblefinch hens 25 s. each. In no place was there any direct use of the words \\"offer for sale\\". A Thomas Shaw Thompson wrote to Partridge asking him to send him an ABCR Bramblefinch hen (a brambling) and enclosed a cheque for 30s. On 1 May 1967, Partridge dispatched a brambling, which was wearing a closed-ring around its leg, to Thompson in a box. Thompson received the box and was able to remove the ring from the bird's leg without injuring it. Partridge was charged by Anthony Ian Crittenden, on behalf of the RSPCA, with illegally offering for sale a live wild bird which was not a close-ringed specimen, bred in captivity, against s. 6(1)* and Sch. 4* of the Protection of Birds Act 1954. The magistrates decided that the advertisement was an offer for sale and that the ABCR Bramblefinch hen was not a close-ringed specimen bred in captivity, because it was possible to remove the ring from the bird's leg. Partridge was convicted, was fined ¬£5 and ordered to pay ¬£5 5 s advocate's fee and ¬£4 9 s. 6 d. witnesses' expenses. Partridge appealed against conviction. Relevant law Section 6(1) of the Protection of Birds Act 1954 states: :\\"If ... any person sells, offers for sale ... (a) any live wild bird... including in Schedule 4 to this Act of a species which is resident in or visits the British Isles in a wild state, other than a close- ringed specimen bred in captivity; ... he shall be guilty of an offence ...\\". Schedule 4 of the Act has the heading \\"Wild birds which may not be sold alive unless close-ringed and bred in captivity\\" and amongst the names in the schedule is \\"brambling\\".Protection of Birds Act 1954 Judgment The High Court had to answer whether the appellant's advertisement constituted a legitimate offer for sale (as the prosecution chose to prosecute only for the weaker of the three possible alleged facts), and whether the bird was not a close-ringed specimen bred in captivity under the Protection of Birds Act 1954 if it were possible to remove the ring from its leg. It was held that the advertisement in question constituted in law an invitation to treat and not an offer to sell; therefore the offence with which the appellant was charged was not established. The judges also said that if the only issue were whether the bird was a close-ringed specimen under the Protection of Birds Act 1954, the magistrates' judgment would have been upheld. Ashworth J gave his judgment first. Lord Parker CJ said the following. Blain J concurred.

The charts are a record of the highest selling songs and albums in various genres in Australia. ARIA became the official Australian music chart in June 1988, succeeding the Kent Music Report which had been Australia's national music sales charts since 1974. History The Go-Set charts were Australia's first national singles and albums charts, published from 5 October 1966 until 24 August 1974. Succeeding Go-Set, the Kent Music Report began issuing the national top 100 charts in Australia from May 1974. The compiler, David Kent, also published Australia's national charts from 1940 to 1974 in a retrospective fashion using state based data. In mid 1983, the Australian Recording Industry Association commenced licensing the Kent Music Report chart. The first printed national top 50 chart available in record stores, branded the Countdown chart, was dated the week ending 10 July 1983. ARIA began compiling its own charts in-house from the chart survey dated 13 June 1988, corresponding with the printed top 50 chart dated week ending 26 June 1988. Various artists compilation albums were initially included in the albums chart, as they had been on the Kent Report chart, until 2 July 1989, when a separate Compilations chart was created. The ARIA Report, detailing the top 100 singles and albums charts, was first available via subscription in January 1990. The printed top 50 chart ceased publication in June 1998, but resumed publication later in the year. The printed top 50 chart again ceased publication at the end of 2000. Since 17 February 1997, all physical sales data contributing towards the chart has been recorded electronically at point of sale. In March 1991, \\"Do the Bartman\\" by The Simpsons was the first single to reach #1 in Australia that was not available on 7-inch vinyl, but cassingle only. In April 2006, ARIA began publishing the Digital Tracks Chart, counting download sales data from providers such as iTunes and BigPond Music. Starting from 9 October 2006, digital sales data was integrated into the singles chart alongside physical sales, although singles were required to have a physical release to be included. From 5 November 2007, the eligibility rules were widened so that singles only available digitally could chart, and \\"Apologize\\" by Timbaland was the first single to enter the chart purely on digital sales. In February 2008, \\"Don't Stop the Music\\" by Rihanna became the first single to reach number one on digital sales alone. In May 2006, it was announced that the Brazin retailing group, comprising HMV, Sanity and Virgin Megastore outlets, would no longer contribute sales data to the ARIA charts. However, after a five-month absence, Brazin reportedly re-commenced contributing sales figures on 26 November 2006. On 10 December 2012, ARIA launched the Streaming Tracks Chart, tracking audio streaming data from services such as Spotify, and later Apple Music. ARIA introduced streaming data into the singles chart on 24 November 2014, and the albums chart on 15 May 2017. In October 2018, ARIA changed the methodology to give greater emphasis to paid subscription streams over ad-supported streams. Publication The ARIA website publishes the top 50 singles and albums charts (truncated from the top 100), top 40 digital tracks chart (truncated from the top 50), and top 20 dance singles chart (truncated from the top 25). The ARIA Report lists all charts in full and is available via paid e-mail subscription each week. These reports are uploaded to the Pandora Archive periodically. The top 50 singles and albums charts are also published by online industry magazine The Music Network, along with various other charts. Chart shows On 5 February 2006, the ARIA Chart Show was a radio program launched on the Nova network and broadcast throughout Australia, playing the official ARIA top 50 singles.

Like Mad, it was a black-and-white newsstand publication in a magazine format and did not carry the seal of the Comics Code Authority. An anthology magazine, it initially was published quarterly but later went bimonthly. Each issue's stories were introduced by the host character, Uncle Creepy. Its sister publications were Eerie and Vampirella. Launch Illustrator and editor Russ Jones, the founding editor of Creepy in 1964, said he approached Famous Monsters of Filmland magazine publisher Jim Warren with the idea of horror comics similar to the 1950s' EC Comics comic books. Warren also choose not to use the comics industry's voluntary self-censorship Comics Code Authority for his black and white magazines. Warren eventually agreed. Jones recalled that, Joe Orlando was not only an illustrator for Creepy but also a story editor on early issues, with his masthead credit reading: \\"Story Ideas: Joe Orlando.\\" Bill Pearson also worked on the first issue. The Archie Goodwin era In 1965, Russ Jones had a falling out with publisher Jim Warren and departed. Archie Goodwin, having already been writing most of the stories and working with most of the regular artists, succeeded him as editor. Goodwin, who became one of comics' foremost writers, helped establish the company as a prominent force in the field of black-and-white comics magazines. Artists during this era included Neal Adams, Dan Adkins, Reed Crandall, Johnny Craig, Steve Ditko, Frank Frazetta, Gray Morrow, John Severin, Angelo Torres, Alex Toth, Al Williamson and Wally Wood. Originally published quarterly, Creepy switched to bi-monthly by the end of 1965. To help draw the best possible performance out of the artists working on the series, prior to writing a story Goodwin would ask the artist what type of story or setting he would like to work in; this also served to narrow Goodwin's thinking, making it easier for him to come up with a story idea. He also wrote a considerable number of adaptations of public domain works for Creepy. Initially, out of a feeling that the original works were overly familiar, he would change either the ending or the beginning of the story when doing these adaptations. Eventually he concluded that this was presumptuous, and began adhering more closely to the original stories. Goodwin resigned as the editor of Creepy after issue 17 (October 1967). Due to a lack of funds, the majority of the magazine's leading artists left, and Warren was forced to rely on reprints, which would be prevalent in the magazine until issue 32 in April 1970. A variety of editors ran the magazine during this period, including Bill Parente, Nicola Cuti and Warren himself. Things would pick up starting in 1969 with the premiere of Vampirella magazine. Some of Creepy's original artists, including Frazetta, Crandall and Wood, would return, as did Goodwin, who was associate editor for issues 35 through 39. Editors and artists A variety of editors continued to manage Creepy after Goodwin's second departure, including Billy Graham and J. R. Cochran. William Dubay, who had started at Warren as an artist with issue 32 in 1970, would become editor of the magazine for issues 50 through 78, except for a short period of time in 1974, when Goodwin returned for issues 61 through 64. During this period the frequency of Creepy and Warren's other magazines was upped to nine issues per year. Another major development occurred in late 1971 when artists from the Barcelona Studio of Spanish agency Selecciones Illustrada started appearing in Creepy and other Warren magazines. Artists from Spain would go on to dominate Creepy and the other Warren magazines throughout the 1970s. These artists included Esteban Maroto, Jaime Brocal, Rafael Aura Le√≥n, Martin Salvador, Luis Garc√≠a, Fernando Fern√°ndez, Jos√© Gonz√°lez, Jos√© Bea, Isidro Mon√©s, Sanjuli√°n, and Enrich Torres. Additional artists from S.I.'s Valencia Studio joined Warren in 1974 including Jos√© Ortiz, Luis Bermejo, and Leopold S√°nchez. Writers during Dubay's era as editor included Gerry Boudreau, Budd Lewis, Jim Stenstrum, Steve Skeates and Doug Moench. Themed specials dominated Dubay's era as editor, and included two Edgar Allan Poe issues (69 and 70), three Christmas issues (59, 68 and 77), three issues dedicated to a single artist (71, 72 and 74), a science fiction issue (73) and an issue where every story was based on the cover painting (64). This era also featured stories that were printed in color, many of which were done by Richard Corben. Towards the end of his period as editor, many artists from Creepy's first golden era returned, including Alex Toth and John Severin. Dubay resigned after issue 78 and was replaced by Louise Jones, his former assistant. Jones would edit the magazine until issue 116 in March 1980. Former DC Comics publisher Carmine Infantino joined Warren shortly after he became editor and did pencils for over 50 stories. Much like the wave of Spanish artists that dominated Creepy throughout the mid-1970s, a number of artists from the Philippines joined Warren during Jones' period as editor, including Alex Ni√±o, Alfredo Alcala and Rudy Nebres, remaining with Creepy until its end in 1983. While he had resigned as editor, Dubay remained with Warren and became their dominant writer during this period. Other frequent writers during this period included Bruce Jones, Bob Toomey and Roger McKenzie. After Louise Jones resigned as editor following issue 116, Dubay returned to edit the magazine using the alias \\"Will Richardson\\" until issue 126. After Dubay's departure, various editors including Chris Adames and Timothy Moriarty held the position. Reprints once again began in the magazine with many reprint issues being dedicated to a single artist. Warren's last Creepy (#145) was published February 1983, and then he went bankrupt. Harris Publications bought rights after Warren's bankruptcy and published a single issue (#146) in 1985. In 2000, after a protracted legal dispute with Harris Publications,Spurgeon, Tom. \\"News Watch: Warren Case Moves Forward: Publisher Claims Numerous Violations in Case Against Harris Publications,\\" The Comics Journal #210 (Feb. 1999), pp. 11-13.\\"News Watch: Jim Warren Sues Harris Publications\\" The Comics Journal #211 (Apr. 1999), p. 8. Jim Warren and Warren Publishing finally regained sole ownership of all rights to his two iconic and flagship comic book franchises Creepy and Eerie. Archives and the relaunch Editor Dan Braun signs a collected edition of Creepy next to a model dressed as Uncle Creepy at the Dark Horse Comics booth at the 2011 New York Comic Con. In February 2007, New Comic Company, LLC completed a total rights acquisition from Warren and his entity for all rights to Creepy and Eerie, after seven years of effort. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. All copyright renewals and trademarks have been re-established in the name of New Comic Company LLC. Shortly after that rights acquisition deal, in June 2007, New Comic Company LLC principals Dan Braun, Craig Haffner, Josh Braun and Rick Brookwell completed a partnership agreement with Dark Horse Comics and its CEO Mike Richardson to republish in archival hardcover form all 285 total issues of the original Creepy and Eerie. The first Creepy archival volume was published in August 2008, with additional releases available every four months. The first Eerie archival volume was released in March 2009, with subsequent archives available every four months. In July 2009, Dark Horse Comics and New Comic Company LLC released the new Creepy magazine.Doctorow, Cory. \\"Creepy horror comic rises from the grave and is terrifyingly good\\", Boing Boing, October 13, 2009.

To date he has released 3 solo albums and six E.P's under his performer name of Stoney. Known for his sharp lyrics and classic melodies, he first came to prominence in the \\"New Yorkshire\\" music scene (as the NME would label it) in the mid 2000s touring and working alongside acts such as Arctic Monkeys, Long Blondes and Reverend and the Makers. Following relocation to Austin, Texas in 2009, he became a founding member, songwriter and guitarist of acclaimed \\"dirt-pop\\" band Bobby Jealousy, who released two full-length albums between 2012‚Äì2014, before resuming his solo career back in the UK. Stoney is also an accomplished producer and co-writer for up and coming talent and has worked with Ivor Novello award-winning Guy Chambers, Rick Rubin, Warren Huart and Tim Palmer. Stoney currently lives and works in Sheffield, England. Early career Stoney first appeared on the UK music scene following the release of his debut inventive and homegrown-style album Amber in 2001. A quirky collection of songs written in his teens, and recorded in his Sheffield basement following his escape from his hometown of Croydon, it was independently distributed initially through a few local record shops on his own Holy Moly label. Stoney played all the instruments on the record. In response to the positive public reaction, a full band was formed to take the songs to the stage, and a three track EP of songs from the album, entitled Amber EP, was released nationally on Thunderbird Records the next year gaining Stoney his first national radio airplay. Stoney signed to Island Records in 2003, teaming up with producers Kevin Bacon and Jon Quarmby (Longpigs, Richard Hawley, Sugababes, Finley Quaye) to record an album. During this time, Stoney and his band performed under the name of Stoneylacuna, to reflect the change from the singer- songwriter feel of Amber to the bigger, full band sound of the new recordings. However, political wrangles ensued and Stoney parted company with the label the following year without a record being released. The Scene and The Unseen A few months after parting ways with Island Records, the limited edition single \\"Constantly Running\\" was released nationally on the small Transistor label, and became the single of the week on the iTunes music store, restarting a frenzy of activity. The single achieved over 17,000 downloads in the UK alone in the first week. Stoney followed up with the Soap in a Bathtub EP, which brought him further national exposure. After forming a new band, Stoney provided the support for the Arctic Monkeys first sell-out UK tour in the Summer of 2005, alongside festival appearances at Glastonbury and Leeds. Stoney became a regular guest on BBC Radio 2 and BBC 6Music and further shows with high-profile acts such as Jamie T, Athlete and Feeder along with his own headline shows quickly gained him a reputation as an exhilarating and charismatic live performer, continuing to win him a steadily growing underground UK fanbase. A double A-side single featuring fan favourites \\"Until You Leave\\" and \\"Holds the Stars\\" was released at the end of 2005. Stoney released the 12 track album The Scene and The Unseen in the summer of 2006 on the independent Manchester based label Too Nice Recordings and as a download on iTunes. Despite a typically low-key and organic release, it prompted widespread critical acclaim from the national UK papers, with rave reviews from The Independent, NME, The Sunday Times and The Daily Express. It reached Number 19 in the UK iTunes download chart and peaked at Number 4 in France. The album was re-released with full UK distribution on his own Sonic Roar Label in November 2007. During this period, Stoney also started producing other artists, and set up Lacuna Productions, a record production company with fellow Sheffield producer Sam Jones. Lacuna birthed debut singles from several rising Sheffield indie stars such as Bromheads Jacket and Little Ze. Relocation to US  Following an acoustic show at the SXSW festival in Texas, he was flown to Los Angeles by Rick Rubin for a private showcase and champions of Stoney on US radio such as Nic Harcourt at KCRW raised Stoney's profile over the Atlantic. His tracks started to feature in several Hollywood films & TV series. In response Stoney relocated to Austin, Texas in 2009 and began working on new material with a number of producers including C.J Eiriksson (u2, the rocket summer, Blue October), Darin Prindle (Madonna, Destiny's Child) His first public show was a stripped back set at the British Music Embassy showcase at SXSW alongside Laura Marling & Aqualung and presented by Nic Harcourt. In 2010, Stoney was among the earliest artists to implement the fan funding model, teaming up with PledgeMusic, he successfully launched a new 4 track E.P entitled \\"The Soar Before\\" and an accompanying 16 date U.K tour with Athlete. The fans raised the target in 3 days, and the tour was followed by Stoney's fourth live session and interview on Dermot O'Leary's BBC Radio 2 show, alongside fellow guest Paul McCartney. Bobby Jealousy  In the summer of 2012, Stoney took a departure from his solo career and co- founded a new band in Austin named \\"Bobby Jealousy\\" alongside local punk singer Sabrina Ellis and producer Seth Gibbs. The trio of songwriters adopted the services of drummer Clint Simmons and quickly established a strong following in Austin with a series of raucous live residencies around the City. Their debut album \\"A little Death\\" was recorded at Gibb's Superpop Studio in the space of a few weeks and was met with critical acclaim, with the lead single \\"Rainbow\\" being adopted as the theme tune for Comedy Central's \\"Big Time in Hollywood, FL\\" TV Show. The band released a follow up album \\"The Importance of being Jealous\\", appeared at the Austin City Limits Music Festival and conducted two tours of the United States before parting ways in 2014. More Than Animals Following the break up of Bobby Jealousy, Stoney resumed work on a Solo album and in 2014 released his third full album More Than Animals once again to critical acclaim. Largely self produced, several tracks from the album were mixed in Los Angeles with Producer Warren Huart. The release was again fan-funded through Pledgemusic, and met with very favorable reviews internationally. A video for the album track \\"We Belonged\\" was shot in the Hill Country in Texas to accompany the album release and the track has since been used in the Series finale of popular us TV show Hart of Dixie and the feature film \\"The Funeral Guest\\". The album track \\"Devil on My Back\\" was used in the first series finale of Legends starring Sean Bean. Current work After moving back to the UK in 2015, Stoney began working extensively as a producer and co-writer, helping to develop and support emerging talent across multiple genres, as well as collaborations with established artists such as The Big Pink and Jade Castrinos (of Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros) In early 2020, Stoney announced on social media the forthcoming release of new solo material later in the year.

First published in 1979, the magazine had a circulation of 57,108 copies in December 2010. The magazine includes interviews, a skills school, quizzes and a weekly round-up of results, tables and player ratings from the four main English divisions and the Scottish Premier League in MatchFacts. It mostly covers teams and players in the English Premier League, but also has a limited coverage of La Liga, Serie A and international football.  History  Match magazine was launched on 6 September 1979, at a cover price of 25p. The original editor was Mel Bagnall. Kevin Keegan was the first cover star of Match and supported the magazine with his column, Learn To Play The Keegan Way. The first issue came with an 80-page sticker album and included columns by Tottenham star Ossie Ardiles, Manchester United's Steve Coppell and Nottingham Forest manager, Brian Clough. Later columnists included David Platt, Mark Bright and Ryan Giggs. In March 1980, Match launched its first Matchman Of The Month contest. The award, based on a player's match rating, was won by Ossie Ardiles. He defeated Trevor Francis to win the title and won ¬£100. Matchman Of The Month now has no financial reward. On its launch in 1979, the magazine initially failed to catch the dominant circulation of its main weekly football rival, Shoot. In the mid-1990s the magazine was successfully revitalised and relaunched by Chris Hunt, an editor with a wealth of experience in teenage music and sport magazines. Under his editorship Match was transformed, finally overtaking Shoot to become the biggest-selling football title in Britain, with its weekly sales peaking at 242,000 during this period. This not only marked the highest point in the magazine's sales history (a record that still stands), but the high-water mark of the British football magazine market in the 1990s. In the face of such market dominance by Match, during this period many of its rival titles either closed or, in the case of Shoot, changed frequency to monthly. Shoot finally closed in June 2008. A number of notable football journalists have started their careers at Match, including Mark Irwin of The Sun, Hugh Sleight of FourFourTwo, Paul Smith of The Sunday Mirror, Ray Ryan formerly with The News of the World, Adrian Curtis formerly of the Mail On Sunday, Evening Standard and The Press Association; and Rob Shepherd.

The Canning River received its contemporary name in 1827 when Captain James Stirling aboard following an examination of the region in March 1827 named the river after George Canning, an eminent British statesman who was Prime Minister of Great Britain at the time and whose government facilitated the funds for the expedition. In November 1829, just five months after the founding of the Swan River Colony in Western Australia, an exploring party led by now Governor James Stirling chose a site for a new town named Kelmscott on the banks of the Canning River.

It was built primarily for the use of barges carrying timber from Mason's Timber Mill in the Darling Ranges. Part of the Convict Fence in Canning River between Shelley Foreshore Reserve and Salter Point. The river is home to much wildlife including dolphins, pelicans, swans and many other bird species. Algae bloom Algal blooms occur naturally in the Canning River system, they are caused by a buildup of nutrients in the river. Human activities including farming, residential gardens and parklands are the major causes of increases in levels, the blooms are potentially toxic to both mammal and marine life. The Swan River Trust monitors the levels of nutrients and growth of the algae issuing warnings and closing sections of the river to all activities. The Trust also operates cleanup programs to reduce the amount of nutrients reaching the river, as well phosphorus removal and oxygenation in areas were blooms have been identified. The Trust is encouraged by the appearance of Azolla carpets on sections of the Canning River as this fern is known to reduce the amount of sunlight available to the algae as well as absorbing large amounts of phosphorus and other nutrients from the water. However, it is possible that Azolla carpets can cause deoxygenation and emit a strong sulfur smell. Canning River without the Azolla in February 2006.

FACs are usually operated in close proximity to land as they lack both the seakeeping and all-round defensive capabilities to survive in blue water. The size of the vessel also limits the fuel, stores and water supplies. In size they are usually between 50-800 tonnes and can reach speeds of 25-50 knots. A fast attack craft's main advantage over other warship types is its affordability. Many FACs can be deployed at a relatively low cost, allowing a navy which is at a disadvantage to effectively defend itself against a larger adversary. A small boat, when equipped with the same weapons as its larger counterpart, can pose a serious threat to even the largest of capital ships. Their major disadvantages are poor seagoing qualities, cramped quarters and poor defence against aerial threats. History =19th century= As early as the mid-19th century, the Jeune √âcole's poussiere navale theory called for a great number of small, agile vessels to break up invading fleets of larger vessels. The idea was first put into action in the 1870s with the steam- powered torpedo boats, which were produced in large numbers by both the Royal Navy and the French Navy. These new vessels proved especially susceptible to rough seas and to have limited utility in scouting due to their short endurance and low bridges. The potential threat was entirely extinguished with the introduction of the torpedo boat destroyer (TBD) in 1893, a larger vessel which evolved into the modern destroyer. It could mount guns capable of destroying the torpedo boat before it was within range to use its own weapons. US Navy 80 ft Elco PT boats, led by PT-105, at high speed in 1942 =20th century= The idea was revived shortly before World War I with the craft using new gasoline engines. Italy and Great Britain were at the forefront of this design, with the coastal motor boat (CMB) and the motobarca armata silurante (MAS) (Italian: \\"torpedo armed motorboat\\"). The outstanding achievement of the class was the sinking of the Austro-Hungarian battleship by MAS. 15 on June 10, 1918. The equivalent achievement for the CMBs was a lesser success; during the Russian Civil War CMBs attacked the Red Fleet at anchor at Kronstadt on June 18, 1919, sinking the cruiser for the loss of four craft. The design matured in the mid-1930s as the motor torpedo boats (MTBs) and motor gunboats (MGBs) of the Royal Navy, the PT boats of the US Navy, and the E-boats (Schnellboote) of the Kriegsmarine. All types saw extensive use during World War II but were limited in effectiveness due to the increasing threat of aircraft; however, some successes were achieved in favourable conditions, as showcased by the crippling of the cruiser (later scuttled), in the night of 13 August 1942, by Italian MS boats. Post-World War II After World War II, the use of this kind of craft steadily declined in the United States and Britain, despite the introduction of safer diesel engines to replace the highly flammable gasoline ones, although the Soviet Union still had large numbers of MGBs and MTBs in service. A launching a Styx missile The Swedish Ystad-class missile boat HSwMS Ystad (R142) With the development of the anti- ship missile, FACs were reborn in the Soviet Union as \\"missile boats\\" or \\"missile cutters\\". The first few missile boats were originally torpedo boats, with the torpedo tubes replaced by missile launchers. Again, small fast craft could attack and destroy a major warship. The idea was first tested by the Soviet Union which, in August 1957, produced the which mounted two P-15 Termit missiles on a hull with a top speed of around . Endurance was limited to at and the vessels had supplies for only five days at sea. 110 Komar-class vessels were produced, while over 400 examples were built of the following with a significant portion of the total being sold to pro-Soviet nations. The first combat use of missile boats was by the Egyptian Soviet-built Komar-class craft fire of four Styx missiles on the Israeli destroyer Eilat on October 20, 1967, shortly after the Six-Day War, causing the latter's sinking with 47 dead. A vessel of the German Navy The Soviet FACs prompted a NATO response, which became more intense after the sinking of Eilat. The Germans and French worked together to produce a new FAC, resulting in 1968 with the La Combattante class fast attack craft. Built on a hull with four MM-38 Exocet missiles, a 76 mm gun forward and 40 mm twin guns aft, these vessels have a top speed of . Built until 1974, a total of 68 Combattante IIs were launched. The design was immediately followed by the Combattante III, and a great many other shipyards produced their own versions of the Combattante, including the Israeli Sa'ar/Reshef variants. Size has also increased, some designs reaching up to corvette size, 800 tonnes including a helicopter, giving them extended modes of operation. While the Israeli Sa'ar 4-class missile boats, for example, had a 58 metre hull and 415 ton displacement, the Sa'ar 5 is 85 metres in length and displaces 1,065 tons, and is officially rated as a corvette. Iran and North Korea have some of the largest numbers of FACs in operation today. North Korea alone operates more than 300,Hy Sang Lee: North Korea: A Strange Socialist Fortress, p. 85 while Iran has been seen developing \\"swarm boats\\" to be used as harassing vessels in the heavily contested littoral waters of the Persian Gulf. To counter the threat, the US Navy has been developing an ASUW Littoral Defensive Anti Surface Warfare doctrine, along with vessels such as the littoral combat ship.

The cat is created by the Doctor out of nine different cats, leading to his name being Nine. He has no friends and feels lonely, which leads up to him asking the Doctor to create him a friend. Nine learns to be ‚Äúcareful what you wish for‚Äù, as the Doctor creates a companion that is more than Nine can handle. The picture book was republished by Hodder. Characters The main characters are Nine, Lottie, Dr Franken, Fifi, Heidi, Igora, Pipsquawk, Trevor, Sweeny, Bigtop, Mr Crumble and Gutner Van Halen. =Nine= Nine is Dr Frankenstein's first creation: a creature stitched together out of nine different cats (his name is also a pun on the myth that cats have nine lives). Unfortunately for the Doctor, Nine isn't very menacing, although many might consider his smell to be quite frightening. Like all cats, he is naturally curious, and very playful. He might make mistakes sometimes, but he always means well. He is often tricked or bullied by his three ugly sisters, Igora, Heidi and Fifi. His best (and only) friend is Lottie, and he is fiercely protective of her. His voice is provided by comedian Joe Pasquale =Lottie= 8-year-old Lottie is the only girl in Oddsburg, and a relative newcomer. She is on good terms with Doctor Frankenstein, and considers Nine to be her best (and only) friend. She is mischievous by nature, but also kind-hearted, if a little lazy at times. Lottie is also fiercely determined and quite intelligent, easily able to hold her own with the boys. She is always shown wearing her glasses. Her voice is provided by Alex Kelly =Dr Frankenstein= German-accented Dr Frankenstein aspires to be a brilliant mad scientist like all of his forefathers, and most of his time is spent dreaming up mad experiments. Unfortunately, most of his experiments turn out to be failures. Whenever he discards a failed monster, he throws it down into the castle's ‚ÄúWrong Things‚Äù dungeon. Although Heidi, Igora and Fifi treat Nine with disdain, the Doctor isn't bothered with his first creation, although he wishes he could create something more fearsome. He doesn't seem to mind Lottie, and sometimes sends her strange gifts via Nine as a thank-you for sorting monster-related issues out. His voice is provided by Keith Wickham. =Fifi, Heidi and Igora= A dog, hamster and chicken, respectively. Nine's three ugly sisters are all very vain, and are fond of teasing Nine and playing nasty tricks on him. They seem to view the doctor with some contempt, and long for a more glamorous life. Heidi stands out from the others by being a \\"were-hamster\\". =Pipsquawk= Pipsquawk is the diminutive son of Oddsburg's Mayor, who constantly spoils him. He is the leader of the town's gang of four boys, and is usually the loudest one in proclaiming his hatred of girls. His arch-rival is Lottie, who is not only a girl, but a girl who is more talented than he is and on rare occasions, he and the other boys hatched plans to get rid of her. Despite his aggressive attitude, he's actually very cowardly, and has also been shown to be quite insecure. His voice is provided by Keith Wickham. =Trevor= Clever Trevor is Oddsburg's token Nerd, and the second-in-command in Pipsquawk's gang. With big cokebottle glasses, and sporting a lisp, Trevor is the custodian of the inaugural Big Boy's Book of Big Boy Stuff, and is always ready to quote from it whenever the need arises‚Äîsomething which comes at no surprise, as he writes most of the book's entries! Voice provided by Keith Wickham. =Sweeny= Sallow-skinned, goggle-eyed Sweeny is one of the four boys in Oddsburg and is considered to be the most disgusting. He takes an extensive interest in anything slimy, smelly or snotty, and also likes morbid and \\"scary\\" things (although he, like all the other Oddsburg villagers, is a coward). He follows along with what the gang is doing, but his maliciousness is nowhere near as intense as Pipsquawk or Trevor. Voice provided by Teresa Gallagher. =Bigtop= Bigtop is the gentle giant of Oddsburg's four boys. He has a simple mind and is often amused by things that would normally seem unbecoming of an Oddsburg boy, such as dollies or fairy cakes, but gets away with it because he's also very strong. Like Sweeny, he is mostly happy to play along with whatever else the other boys are doing. His father reads accountant tales to him as bedtime stories. He is voiced by Jimmy Hibbert. =Mr Crumble= Mr Crumble is Oddsburg's only teacher. His personality often variates between affable and paranoid, and usually utilizes both traits whilst teaching. He appears to be quite fond of Lottie because she actually takes an interest in learning, although this doesn't save Lottie from being bored to tears in class, just like the boys. Mr Crumble also occasionally joins in the generic angry mob's rampaging. Voice provided by Jimmy Hibbert . =Gutner Van Halen= Van Halen, the \\"Monster Man\\" is a monster hunter who, as he puts it, \\"dedicated his life and limbs to their destruction\\", which is saying something, as he has sustained a few scars in his career; he lost his left arm whilst capturing a Two-Headed Transylvanian Zombie and lost his nose to a Giant Blood-Sucking Leech of the Black Lagoon. How he lost his left eye and his right leg are not known. Animated series adaptation The book has also been adapted as an animated show by MacKinnon & Saunders in the United Kingdom, CCI Entertainment in Canada and Kayenta Productions in France. A digital 2D animation made entirely in Flash, Frankenstein‚Äôs Cat is aimed at the 6+ age group and consists of 30x11-minute episodes. The series generally follows the exploits of hyperactive Franken-pet Nine and his best (and only) friend Lottie as they outwit, outrun and generally outdo the citizens of Oddsburg. France 3 aired the premiere the Monday before Halloween in 2007, the BBC aired the show in January 2008 and ABC1 aired the show in March 2008. The series was also sold to several global broadcasting markets including Singapore (Nickelodeon), South Africa (M-Net), Hong Kong (ATV), Brunei (RTB3), Portugal (RTP), Italy (RaiSat), Germany (KiKa and BFBS), Asia (HBO), Latin America (Nickelodeon), Thailand (True Spark), Australia (ABC1 and Nickelodeon), United Arab Emirates (e-Junior) and Malaysia (Nickelodeon). Animation for the series was handled by A Productions in Bristol, and by Kayenta Productions in Paris. Frankenstein's Cat won the Pulchinella for \\"Best Children's Show\\" at Cartoons On The Bay festival in 2008 and \\"Best TV Show\\" award at the BAF awards also in 2008.

In topology In topology, a map is a branched covering if it is a covering map everywhere except for a nowhere dense set known as the branch set. Examples include the map from a wedge of circles to a single circle, where the map is a homeomorphism on each circle. In algebraic geometry In algebraic geometry, the term branched covering is used to describe morphisms f from an algebraic variety V to another one W, the two dimensions being the same, and the typical fibre of f being of dimension 0. In that case, there will be an open set W' of W (for the Zariski topology) that is dense in W, such that the restriction of f to W' (from V' = f^{-1}(W') to W', that is) is unramified. Depending on the context, we can take this as local homeomorphism for the strong topology, over the complex numbers, or as an √©tale morphism in general (under some slightly stronger hypotheses, on flatness and separability). Generically, then, such a morphism resembles a covering space in the topological sense. For example, if V and W are both Riemann surfaces, we require only that f is holomorphic and not constant, and then there is a finite set of points P of W, outside of which we do find an honest covering :V' \\\\to W'. =Ramification locus= The set of exceptional points on W is called the ramification locus (i.e. this is the complement of the largest possible open set W'). In general monodromy occurs according to the fundamental group of W' acting on the sheets of the covering (this topological picture can be made precise also in the case of a general base field). =Kummer extensions= Branched coverings are easily constructed as Kummer extensions, i.e. as algebraic extension of the function field. The hyperelliptic curves are prototypic examples. =Unramified covering= An unramified covering then is the occurrence of an empty ramification locus. Examples =Elliptic curve= Morphisms of curves provide many examples of ramified coverings. For example, let be the elliptic curve of equation :y^2 - x(x-1)(x-2)=0. The projection of onto the -axis is a ramified cover with ramification locus given by :x(x-1)(x-2)=0. This is because for these three values of the fiber is the double point y^2=0, while for any other value of , the fiber consists of two distinct points (over an algebraically closed field). This projection induces an algebraic extension of degree two of the function fields: Also, if we take the fraction fields of the underlying commutative rings, we get the morphism :\\\\mathbb{C}(x) \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C}(x)[y]/(y^2 - x(x-1)(x-2)) Hence this projection is a degree 2 branched covering. This can be homogenized to construct a degree 2 branched covering of the corresponding projective elliptic curve to the projective line. =Plane algebraic curve= The previous example may be generalized to any algebraic plane curve in the following way. Let be a plane curve defined by the equation , where is a separable and irreducible polynomial in two indeterminates. If is the degree of in , then the fiber consists of distinct points, except for a finite number of values of . Thus, this projection is a branched covering of degree . The exceptional values of are the roots of the coefficient of y^n in , and the roots of the discriminant of with respect to . Over a root of the discriminant, there is at least a ramified point, which is either a critical point or a singular point. If is also a root of the coefficient of y^n in , then this ramified point is \\"at infinity\\". Over a root of the coefficient of y^n in , the curve has an infinite branch, and the fiber at has less than points. However, if one extends the projection to the projective completions of and the -axis, and if is not a root of the discriminant, the projection becomes a covering over a neighbourhood of . The fact that this projection is a branched covering of degree may also be seen by considering the function fields. In fact, this projection corresponds to the field extension of degree :\\\\mathbb C(x) \\\\to \\\\mathbb C(x)[y]/f(x,y). =Varying Ramifications= We can also generalize branched coverings of the line with varying ramification degrees. Consider a polynomial of the form :f(x,y) = g(x) as we choose different points x=\\\\alpha, the fibers given by the vanishing locus of f(\\\\alpha,y) - g(\\\\alpha) vary. At any point where the multiplicity of one of the linear terms in the factorization of f(\\\\alpha,y) - g(\\\\alpha) increases by one, there is a ramification. Scheme Theoretic Examples =Elliptic Curves= Morphisms of curves provide many examples of ramified coverings of schemes. For example, the morphism from an affine elliptic curve to a line :\\\\text{Spec}\\\\left( {\\\\mathbb{C}[x,y]}/{(y^2 - x(x-1)(x-2)} \\\\right) \\\\to \\\\text{Spec}(\\\\mathbb{C}[x]) is a ramified cover with ramification locus given by :X = \\\\text{Spec}\\\\left({\\\\mathbb{C}[x]}/{(x(x-1)(x-2))} \\\\right) This is because at any point of X in \\\\mathbb{A}^1 the fiber is the scheme :\\\\text{Spec}\\\\left({\\\\mathbb{C}[y]}/{(y^2)} \\\\right) Also, if we take the fraction fields of the underlying commutative rings, we get the field homomorphism :\\\\mathbb{C}(x) \\\\to {\\\\mathbb{C}(x)[y]}/{(y^2 - x(x-1)(x-2))}, which is an algebraic extension of degree two; hence we got a degree 2 branched covering of an elliptic curve to the affine line. This can be homogenized to construct a morphism of a projective elliptic curve to \\\\mathbb{P}^1. =Hyperelliptic curve= A hyperelliptic curve provides a generalization of the above degree 2 cover of the affine line, by considering the affine scheme defined over \\\\mathbb C by a polynomial of the form :y^2 - \\\\prod(x-a_i) where a_i eq a_j for i eq j =Higher Degree Coverings of the Affine Line= We can generalize the previous example by taking the morphism :\\\\text{Spec}\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\mathbb{C}[x,y]}{(f(y) - g(x)} \\\\right) \\\\to \\\\text{Spec}(\\\\mathbb{C}[x]) where g(x) has no repeated roots. Then the ramification locus is given by :X = \\\\text{Spec}\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\mathbb{C}[x]}{(f(x))} \\\\right) where the fibers are given by :\\\\text{Spec}\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\mathbb{C}[y]}{(f(y))} \\\\right) Then, we get an induced morphism of fraction fields :\\\\mathbb{C}(x) \\\\to \\\\frac{\\\\mathbb{C}(x)[y]}{(f(y) - g(x))} There is an \\\\mathbb{C}(x)-module isomorphism of the target with :\\\\mathbb{C}(x)\\\\oplus\\\\mathbb{C}(x)\\\\cdot y \\\\oplus \\\\cdots \\\\oplus \\\\mathbb{C}(x)\\\\cdot y^{\\\\text{deg}(f(y))} Hence the cover is of degree \\\\text{deg}(f). =Superelliptic Curves= Superelliptic curves are a generalization of hyperelliptic curves and a specialization of the previous family of examples since they are given by affine schemes X/\\\\mathbb{C} from polynomials of the form :y^k - f(x) where k>2 and f(x) has no repeated roots. =Ramified Coverings of Projective Space= Another useful class of examples come from ramified coverings of projective space. Given a homogeneous polynomial f \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}[x_0,\\\\ldots,x_n] we can construct a ramified covering of \\\\mathbb{P}^n with ramification locus :\\\\text{Proj}\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\mathbb{C}[x_0,\\\\ldots,x_n]}{f(x)} \\\\right) by considering the morphism of projective schemes :\\\\text{Proj}\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\mathbb{C}[x_0,\\\\ldots,x_n][y]}{y^{\\\\text{deg}(f)} - f(x)} \\\\right) \\\\to \\\\mathbb{P}^n Again, this will be a covering of degree f. Applications Branched coverings C \\\\to X come with a symmetry group of transformations G. Since the symmetry group has stabilizers at the points of the ramification locus, branched coverings can be used to construct examples of orbifolds, or Deligne-Mumford stacks.

Next, he held the post of Representative of the Head of Judiciary to the Ministry of Intelligence, from 1991 to 1994. His next post was Prosecutor of the Special Clerical Court, which he held from 1995 to 1997. He was appointed Minister of Intelligence on 24 August 2005 after securing 217 votes in his favor at the Majlis. He was in office until 26 July 2009, when he was abruptly dismissed. No reason was given for his dismissal, but it was thought to be connected to his opposition to the appointment of Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei as first vice- president. Shortly after his dismissal, on 24 August 2009, he was appointed Prosecutor general of Iran by the Head of Judiciary, Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani,Iran's sacked minister appointed as prosecutor general. 25 August 2009 replacing Ghorbanali Dorri-Najafabadi. Activities and views On 15 July 2009, Mohseni-Ejehei told reporters that his ministry might publicize confessions made by people held for weeks without access lawyers. He said \\"The confessions obtained from those arrested could be made public, should the Judiciary decide to air their remarks.\\" Human rights activists raised concerns that \\"these so-called confessions are obtained under duress.\\" After his dismissal, president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad praised Mohsen-Eje'i as a good human being but said his removal was necessary as the ministry needed huge changes to cope with the situation. He further said if the ministry had done its job properly, there would not have been post-election bloody riots in which some people died, but he stopped short of criticizing Mohseni-Eje'i as responsible for them. According to Stratfor, Mohseni-Eje'i is a conservative hardliner affiliated with hardline cleric Mohammad Yazdi. Mohsen-Eje'i has indicated he would welcome alternative punishments to the death penalty for some drug traffickers, if these alternatives proposed by teachers were more effective punishments than the death penalty. But he stated that, so far, critics of the death penalty in Iran have not offered alternatives that would deal effectively with Iran's drug gangs.

Tairrie B started her music career as part of the female dance group Bardeux. After the release of their debut single, \\"Three-Time Lover\\", in 1987, she left the group. Under the tutelage of Eazy-E, she was later signed to his label Ruthless Records (under a new imprint called Comptown Records) and released her first album, Power of a Woman, which, unlike usual Ruthless fare, was distributed by MCA Records. Tairrie B alleges she was assaulted by Dr. Dre at the 1990 Grammy Awards for not collaborating with him on her first album: \\"Everyone with NWA ‚Äì like Above the Law and The D.O.C. ‚Äì whenever they do an album, all of the guys appear on the last track.

When Dr. Dre heard the track, he turned up at the awards ceremony party, where he punched Tairrie \\"twice ‚Äì once in the mouth and once in the eye.

Tairrie B later began working on her second full-length album Single White Female, but before releasing it decided to change her musical direction away from rap.

In December 2008, Tairrie B married her long- time partner and guitarist of My Ruin Mick Murphy. She stated in the band's Myspace blog that she had changed her last name to Murphy, but would continue to use the name Tairrie B in music. In August 2015, Tairrie B returned to her rap roots with her third studio rap album Vintage Curses.

Their purpose is to exist as an authentic Christian community, but in a way which is both provocative and accessible to un-churched people. Thornton recognises that the closure of public houses has diminished community space, and this is an attempt to restore this community asset. As Archbishop Rowan Williams has commented: This can take a number of forms. Sometimes an old public house is purchased, and used as a church building, retaining the welcome and feel of a pub. Others rent a room in an existing pub, and church happens with the context of the functioning public house.

Carr was a founder of the Pacific Northwest 1970s new wave music band Sneakers before embarking on a solo career between forming other bands such as Big Whiskey and Hillbilly Moon. Early life Carr was born into a family of professional country music players, including his father Bob Carr who once toured with Ray Price's Cherokee Cowboys. His uncles Joe Carr and Raleigh \\"Curly\\" Cletis Carr also played during the 1950s and 1960s. In 1961 Carr's cousin Tom Blair with his band the West Coasters had a Top 40 hit with Dollar Bills. Carr's family would hold annual reunion weekends where musical instruments were set up and family members performed. Biography After kicking around with various school bands around Oregon, Carr joined a local band called Shaniko, named after a ghost town in Eastern Oregon. A few years, name and personnel changes later, they became The News until they learned that ex-Clover frontman Huey Lewis had just formed a band in San Franscisco called The News. They changed their name again, settling on Sneakers. Teaming up with local concert promoters Allen and Phillip Kovac who were moving into artist management, and local businessman Huck Coleman, the band set about recording their debut album. The Kovacs enlisted ColGems songwriter Roger Atkins, known for his hits with the Animals and the Monkees, to produce. A record deal was struck with New York-based MMO Group, and Ear Cartoons was released late in 1980 to rave reviews, including a Billboard Magazine Pick of the Week. After a year of solid touring, including shows at the legendary Los Angeles venue, Whisky A Go-Go, the band became disenchanted with their career direction, cutting ties with the Kovacs and their label. Carr left the band in 1981 but returned the next year for a couple of shows and to co-produce their second album, Music From The Sole (which remains unreleased). After leaving Sneakers, Carr moved to Portland Oregon and joined Them Roosters, a spinoff band formed by Lenny Rancher of new wave heroes The Malchicks. Carr spent the next three years travelling and performing around the United States and the U.K., with his Cletis Carr Band and with other outfits. He recorded his debut single That Kind of a Girl / Without Yo, then followed up with an EP, Visible Tracks. Carr moved to Australia in 1986 for an intended holiday with family there. Within days, he had a job at a local music store and had joined two bands. Playing with Lucy DeSoto and Rose Tattoo legend Peter Wells's band, he was introduced to industry icon Sebastian Chase whose label was distributed by CBS (now Sony). He was offered a recording deal and in 1987 began work on his next album, Colourblind, which featured the playing of Wells and fellow Tatts guitarist Mick Cocks. After touring in support of that release, he joined Chris Turner's Big Rock Band, a touring ensemble which featured members of AC/DC, The Saints and Jimmy Barnes. Carr relocated to Melbourne and released two more solo albums, Tales of Ordinary Madness in 1991 and Wooden Nails in 1992 before joining country-rock band Big Whiskey. He wrote the bulk of their debut album which was released in 1994, then left the band to concentrate on his new project, the \\"Traveling Wilburys\\"-styled acoustic outfit Hillbilly Moon, formed with Wells and Top-40 recording artist Paul Norton. The trio were augmented by Norton's wife, singer Wendy Stapleton and Wells' writing partner DeSoto, as well as former Divinyls and Concrete Blonde bassist Tim Millikan. Their first album, Volume One was released in December 1994, debuting at Melbourne's Continental Club to a sold-out house. The band toured for some time but other commitments soon halted their progress. Stapleton had begun performing in the popular Dusty Springfield Show and Wells took off for Europe with the reformed Rose Tattoo. Carr returned to Sydney, where he became a staff writer for Warner/Chappell Music and produced a series of releases for ABC Music's new talent program. He teamed rising country artists the Crosby Sisters with Aussie legend Russell Morris and produced a revamped cover of Russell's 1972 hit \\"Wings of an Eagle\\", winning Duo/Trio of the Year at the 1998 Australian Country Music Awards. In 1999, Carr moved to Nashville and pursued his songwriting career, cowriting with many notable writers and performing regularly on the circuit at the Bluebird Caf√©, Douglas Corner, the Broken Spoke and others. He again drifted behind the scenes, assisting his manager pals Greg Shaw (Keith Urban) and Gina Mendello (Tommy Emmanuel) as well as landing a job with a couple of New Media dotcoms. A mild heart attack slowed him down and he returned to Sydney in 2001, landing a stint at Liberation Music. Through the 2000s he continued to perform and write. The recording of What About You, co-written with and performed by Brooke Leal, was featured over the closing credits of the 2003 hit Australian film, Danny Deckchair. He co-owned three caf√© / music venues and hosted regular Sunday songwriters' sessions in Sydney, taking a year out to run an independent record label, Figtree Words and Music, for seminal Aussie garage rockers Lime Spiders. In 2010, he launched The Listening Room, an acoustic singer and performer showcase aimed at providing emerging artists opportunities to grow and enhance their skills. 2015 saw him put together a band of talented young local musicians to back Rose Tattoo legend, Angry Anderson in a sold-out performance in the Blue Mountains. Throughout the next decade, he continued to record, perform, and tour, mainly in Australia, the UK, Ireland and Europe. In 2016, he released his eighth solo album, and toured the United States in support of it. Current Carr maintains residences in both the historic Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, and Nashville Tennessee. He is active as a songwriter, guitarist, mentor, teacher, and author.

Communities of overseas Vietnamese are referred to as Vi·ªát Ki·ªÅu or ng∆∞·ªùi Vi·ªát h·∫£i ngo·∫°i. History in Australia Up until 1975 there were fewer than 2,000 Vietnam-born people in Australia.Note however, that before 1976 Vietnam was not separately recorded as a country of birth for settlers so the Australian Bureau of Statistics is unable to provide an exact picture of settler intake prior to this time. Following the takeover of South Vietnam by the North Vietnamese communist government in April 1975, Australia, being a signatory to the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, agreed to resettle its share of Vietnam-born refugees under a refugee resettlement plan between 1975 and 1985. After the initial intake of refugees in the late 1970s, there was a second immigration peak in 1983‚Äì84, most likely a result of the 1982 agreement between the Australian and Vietnamese governments (the Orderly Departure Program) which allowed relatives of Vietnamese Australians to leave Vietnam and migrate to Australia. A third immigration peak in the late 1980s seems to have been mainly due to Australia's family reunion scheme. Over 90,000 refugees were processed, and entered Australia during this time. Number of permanent settlers arriving in Australia from Vietnam since 1991 (monthly) By the 1990s, the number of Vietnam-born migrating to Australia had surpassed the number entering as refugees. From 1991 to 1993, the percentage of Vietnam-born migrants had reached 77 per cent of the total intake of Vietnam-born arriving in Australia, and by 2000, the percentage of Vietnam-born migrants had climbed to 98 per cent. In 2001‚Äì2002, 1,919 Vietnam-born migrants and 44 humanitarian entrants settled in Australia. Vietnamese Australians in Australian society =Past history of dual socioeconomics= Vietnamese Australians used to vary in income and social class levels. Australian born Vietnamese Australians are highly represented in Australian universities and many professions (particularly as information technology workers, optometrists, engineers, doctors and pharmacists), whilst in the past, some members in the community were subjected to poverty and crime. =Migratory tendencies= Vietnamese Boat People Memorial, in Brisbane, QLD, dedicated 2 December 2012, executed by Phillip Piperides In December 2001, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade estimated that there were 3,950 Australian citizens that were also a Vietnamese citizen. It is not clear what proportion of this number are returned emigrants with Australian citizenship or their Vietnamese Australian- born kin, and what number is simply other Australians in Vietnam for business or for other reasons. The greater proportion (3,000) were recorded in the south of the country, with the rest dispersed through the provinces of Vietnam. Dual citizenship of Vietnamese and Australian is rare, with most proclaiming Australian citizenship when travelling abroad.https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/Publications_Archive/CIB/cib0001/01CIB05 Demographics =Population= People with Vietnamese ancestry as a percentage of the population in Sydney divided geographically by postal area, as of the 2011 census One dot denotes 100 Vietnamese-born Melbourne residents About 0.8% of the Australian resident population was born in Vietnam; in terms of birthplace, Vietnam has been the fifth-largest source of immigration to Australia, behind the United Kingdom, New Zealand, China, and India. Only The United States and France have larger Viet Kieu communities. According to results of the 2016 Census, 219,355 Australian residents declared that they were born in Vietnam At the 2016 census, 294,798 people declared that they have Vietnamese ancestry. In the 2001 census, the 155,000 people of Vietnamese ancestry were first or second generation Australians; first generation Australians of Vietnamese ancestry outnumbered second generation Australians with Vietnamese ancestry (74% : 26%) Relatively few people of Vietnamese ancestry stated another ancestry (6%). Among the leading ancestries, the proportion of people who spoke a language other than English at home was highest for those of Vietnamese (96%). At the 2006 Census, 173,663 Australian residents declared themselves to be of Vietnamese ancestry. A further 2,190 declared themselves as having Hmong ancestry. Respondents could nominate up to two ancestries. There may additionally be persons of Vietnamese descent born in Australia, or of arguably non-Vietnamese ancestries (such as Cantonese) born in Vietnam, who elected not to nominate their ancestry as Vietnamese. Over three-quarters of people born in Vietnam live in New South Wales (63,786, or 39.9%) and Victoria (58,878, or 36.8%). In Melbourne the suburbs of Richmond, Footscray, Springvale, Sunshine and St Albans have a significant proportion of Vietnamese-Australians, while in Sydney they are concentrated in Cabramatta, Cabramatta West, Canley Vale, Canley Heights, Bankstown, St John's Park and Fairfield. Other places of significant Vietnamese presence include Brisbane, where many have settled in suburbs like Darra and Inala, Adelaide, Canberra and Perth. =Religions= Cao Dai Temple in Wiley Park, New South Wales Phap Hoa Temple, a Vietnamese Buddhist temple in Adelaide. According to census data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 2004, Vietnamese Australians are, by religion, 30.3 per cent Catholic, 0.4 per cent Anglican, 3.1 Other Christian, 55.2 per cent Other Religions, mainly Buddhist, Taoism, and Ancestor Worship and 11.0 per cent No Religion. According to the , 40.46% of Australians with Vietnamese ancestry are Buddhists, 28.77% are Christians, and 26.46% follow secular or no religious beliefs. =Language= In 2001, the Vietnamese language was spoken at home by 174,236 people in Australia. Vietnamese was the sixth most widely spoken language in the country after English, Chinese, Italian, Greek and Arabic. Vietnamese-Australian to Vietnam relationship =Media= During October 2003, government owned SBS TV began airing a Vietnamese news program called Thoi Su ('News'). The stated purpose was to provide a news service to cater for Australia's Vietnamese population. This was received poorly by the significant portion of the Vietnamese community as many had previously fled after the fall of South Vietnam and thus harbour resentment to the communist government and its institutions, including the state-controlled media. Thoi Su was regarded as a mouthpiece for the ruling Vietnamese Communist Party, and uncritically endorsed government policy and practices using strong language while failing to report issues objectively including political arrests or religious oppression in Vietnam. A large protest was convened outside SBS's offices. SBS decided to drop Thoi Su (which was being provided at no cost to SBS through a satellite connection). SBS subsequently began broadcasting disclaimers before each foreign news program stating it does not endorse their contents.

Born and raised in Linz, she rose to fame as the runner-up of the inaugural season of the ORF eins television talent series Starmania. Following her participation, she signed with Universal Music and released her debut single \\"Ich lebe\\" which spent nine weeks atop the Austrian Singles Chart. It was followed by the release of her first two albums, Freier Fall (2003) and Soll das wirklich alles sein (2004), both of which debuted atop the Austrian Albums Chart and produced eight top ten hits, including the number-one singles \\"Mama (Ana Ahabak)\\" and \\"Vorbei\\". With the release of her international debut album Schwarz Weiss, St√ºrmer became one of the biggest-selling Austrian artists to emerge in German-speaking Europe in the mid-2000s. She followed her international breakthrough with a series of successful albums, including the chart toppers Lebe lauter (2006), In dieser Stadt (2009), Ich h√∂r auf mein Herz (2013) and Seite an Seite (2016). Several singles from these album became hits on the pop charts in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, including the number-one hits \\"Nie genug\\" and \\"Um bei dir zu sein\\" as well as top ten singles such as \\"Mitten unterm Jahr\\" and Millionen Lichter\\". Throughout a career spanning 15 years, St√ºrmer has sold over 2.0 million records. Aside from her commercial accomplishments, her work has earned her numerous awards and accolades, including eleven Amadeus Austrian Music Awards, a Goldene Stimmgabel, and two ECHO Awards. In 2015, St√ºrmer took part in the second season of the German The Best Singers adaptation Sing meinen Song ‚Äì Das Tauschkonzert. In 2017, she served as a coach on the German television series It Takes 2.  Early life and music career  = Starmania = In 2003, St√ºrmer won second place in Starmania behind Michael Tschuggnall. Shortly after that she released her first original song, \\"Ich Lebe\\" (I Live) which in 2003 occupied the number one spot on the Austrian music charts for nine weeks. = Beginning her career in Austria = After \\"Ich Lebe\\" followed two more highly successful singles: \\"Geh nicht wenn du kommst\\" (Don't Go When You Come) and the anti-war song Mama (Ana Ahabak) (Arabic for Mama, I Love You) which originated during the war in Iraq. The song represents a little Iraqi girl's perspective of the war, and it also spent nine weeks at the number one spot on the Austrian charts. Her first album, Freier Fall (Free Fall), was released exclusively in Austria in May 2003, and it also rose quickly to the top of the charts, where it occupied the number one spot for weeks. In fall of 2003 she did an Austrian tour behind the strength of her first album. In May 2004 her second album, Soll das wirklich alles sein (Is that really everything?) appeared, again only in Austria. The album was even more successful than Freier Fall, (Free Fall) but the album's singles had only average sales figures. The Wirklich alles! (Really Everything!) tour in Austria followed in the fall. The highlight of this tour was the concert at Vienna city hall in November, which sold out all 11,000 tickets in a very short time. The concert was filmed, and along with some interviews and a short biography, was released in DVD form as Wirklich alles! During the club tour that began directly after the Vienna concert, she presented for the first time her own original compositions, which she had written with her band. = Breakthrough in Germany = At this time, Christina and her managers, Andreas Streit and Bernd Rengleshausen, were working towards breaking through in Germany. The single Vorbei was released in Germany in November 2004, but it fell short of expectations. In April 2005 a re-worked version of \\"Ich Lebe\\" was released in Germany. This single met with great success; it rose to ninth place on the German charts, and shortly thereafter reached number four. The album which followed, named Schwarz Weiss (Black White) was released in June 2005, in Germany and Switzerland, reached number three on the German album charts, and stayed in the top twenty for more than a year. The majority of the songs on this album, which were mostly already known in Austria, were reproduced and oriented towards the emerging trends in German rock and pop music. The singles were \\"Engel fliegen Einsam\\" (Angels Fly Lonely) \\"Mama (Ana Ahabak)\\", and \\"Immer an euch geglaubt\\" (Always Believed In You). The singles were also re- recorded to be more rock oriented. In late 2005 Christina and her band toured through Germany and Switzerland. The Schwarz-Weiss tour, with just under 40 concerts, lasted two months, in which some concerts had to be relocated to larger halls because of the great demand for tickets. Christina St√ºrmer and her band had established themselves as a major group. = Continued success = In 2006, Christina and her band released their fourth album, Lebe lauter (Live Louder). The album reached number one in both Germany and Austria. And the singles, Nie genug (Never Enough), and Um bei dir zu sein/An Sommertagen (To Be By Your Side/On Summer Days) both reached number one as well on the Austrian charts. The first single, Nie genug reached a respectable number fifteen in Germany. The following singles after Um bei dir zu sein/An Sommertagen, Ohne Dich (Without You) and Scherbenmeer both reached the top ten in Austria. When Austria co-hosted Euro 2008 with Switzerland, Christina's song Fieber was the Austrian song for Euro 2008,Christina St√ºrmer - Lyrics followed by her last album In dieser Stadt in 2009, which brought us two more singles, \\"Ist mir egal\\" and \\"Mehr als perfekt\\". Her single \\"Wir Leben den Moment\\" was released 3 September 2010, from her latest album, Nahaufnahme (Close-up), which was released in 2010. This album also featured some other hits, such as Warum (Why) and Juniherz (Heart of June). In 2013, her next single Millionen Lichter (Millions of Lights) was released on March 29. It was followed by the release of the album Ich h√∂r auf mein Herz (I Listen to My Heart) on April 19. The video was shot in California, USA.  Private life  In August 2016 Christina St√ºrmer became a mother with her longtime band member and boyfriend Oliver Varga. Their daughter was named \\"Marina\\".

It is an amalgamation of the Usher Gallery and the City and County Museum. The museum part of the enterprise is housed in a new, purpose-built building close by the Usher Gallery in the city of Lincoln.  History  'The Collection' exists since 2005. It is a merge between the 'Usher Gallery,' that was established in 1927 and the 'City and County Museum', that was founded in 1906. The first curator of the Lincoln City and County Museum was Arthur Smith (1869‚Äì1947), who was born in Leicester and raised in Grimsby and who was interested in natural history. After being appointed curator he moved to Lincoln. He became the (Honorary) Secretary of the Lincolnshire Naturalists' Union (LNU), and acquired important collections, for example from J.E. Mason (Heteroptera, bugs), W. Wallace (Diptera, flies) and G.W. Mason (Lepidoptera, butterflies). The Museum also acquired important collections of bird specimen, for instance from George Henry Caton Haigh. Smith retired as curator in 1935. He moved away from Lincoln and died in 1947. Location Lincoln consists of two parts, that at the top of the cliff and that in the Witham valley. The site of the collection is on the steep slope between the two and within the Roman colonia which linked the first century legionary fortress with the shipping and commerce in the river. The Collection - the \\"glass covered 'alley'\\" referred to in the text Buildings The Usher Gallery was built to house the collection of James Ward Usher, using funds he bequeathed for the purpose. It was designed by the architect, Sir Reginald Blomfield and was officially opened on 25 May 1927 by the Prince of Wales. It is a basically simple building faced in stone with brick panels separated by simplified Tuscan pilasters above which is a frieze decorated with triglyphs and a roof line finished with a balustrade. The portico, central in the south fa√ßade, is topped by a broken pediment and urn finials. It stands in a small park on the hillside looking southwards across the lower town. The Usher Gallery is the only purpose-built public art gallery in Lincolnshire and a Grade II* Listed Building. The Usher is owned by Lincoln City Council but leased to Lincolnshire County Council. Following an architectural design competition managed by RIBA Competitions Panter Hudspith Architects (project architect, Hugh Strange) designed the new building and the doors were opened in October 2005 after much hard work including an archaeological excavation. Despite the building's having been designed to rest above the Roman horizon, at the foot of the pit for the lift shaft, it just found the corner of a mosaic-paved passage which had been laid around a courtyard. Much of the new building is faced and paved with Ancaster stone and borrows the concept of the glass-covered courtyard from the British Museum in a feature reminiscent of a medieval alley. The main entrance is at the northern, uphill end and leads past, to the left, the caf√© which faces south across a courtyard and to the right, the shop. Passing the reception desk leads to the orientation hall which is the glass-covered 'alley' passing east to west. From it, the visitor reaches auditorium where video or personal introductions to the museum or to education courses may be given; the education suite; the archaeological collection or the New Curtois Gallery, where touring exhibitions are housed. Below these last two, at the downhill end of the building, are the stores and workshops which service the whole. Exhibits Painting of Joseph Banks by Benjamin West held by Usher Art Gallery The Witham Shield, displayed in March 2013 at The Collection, on temporary loan from the British Museum The sample of mosaic, exposed by the pre-construction archaeological excavation is now on view inside as part of a display extending through all periods from the Ice age. The mosaic is the largest to be discovered in Lincoln for over a hundred years. The archaeological exhibition in The Collection building is organised as a timeline from the stone age, through Roman, Anglo-Saxon (including the Horncastle boar's head) and Viking occupation to the Medieval. Much of the Iron Age material is from the dig at Fiskerton, including the Fiskerton log boat. It includes a satellite photograph of the county of Lincolnshire on a scale which permits fields and villages to be sought out while the picture's extent allows a general pattern of geology and the influence of the Roman roads to show through. The long-established displays in the Usher Gallery include furniture, clocks and other forms of the decorative arts, from Usher's collection. There is a range of fine art works by J. M. W. Turner, John Piper and L. S. Lowry. The gallery's specialism is in the works of Peter De Wint, a former Lincoln resident. Other artists include works by: Ivon Hitchens, Charles Haslewood Shannon, Grayson Perry. Four galleries of various sizes are set aside for temporary exhibitions. Modern and contemporary art programme The Usher Gallery has an established programme of inviting contemporary curators and artists to exhibit modern and contemporary artwork in the main galleries alongside the Usher collection. In 2014, print works by Andy Warhol, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali and Henri Matisse from the touring show Modern Masters went on display at the Museum. In 2013, conceptual artist and academic, Professor Raimi Gbadamosi was invited to curate the rehang display What's Going On, featuring loans from The Arts Council Collection, The British Art Medal Society and contemporary artists, Edward Allington, Kimathi Donkor, Amanda Francis, Permindar Kaur, Taslim Martin, Janette Parris, Ritu Sood, Susan Stockwell, Maiko Tsutsumi & Mark Woods Gulbenkian Prize In May 2006, The Collection was on a short list of four innovative museums being considered for the 2006 Gulbenkian Prize. The prize was awarded to SS Great Britain.The Gulbenkian Prize Possible closure of the Usher Under 2019 proposals from Lincolnshire County Council, the Usher Gallery could be closed and the building turned into a wedding venue. The authority said it would look at moving some of the artwork to the neighbouring museum. The plans have been criticised by art lovers. The county council is looking to save around ¬£750,000 each year from its heritage budget. The council said it would save ¬£100,000 per annum by ceasing to run the Usher as an art gallery. On 2 April 2019 a public meeting was held at Lincoln Minster School to discuss the issue, and on 13 April an art march was held.

It is located near the Melbourne City Centre, on two campuses: one ‚Äì the Melbourne Conservatorium of Music (The Conservatorium) ‚Äì on the Parkville campus of the University of Melbourne, and the other ‚Äì the Victorian College of the Arts (VCA) ‚Äì on St Kilda Road, at Southbank. Since 2019 a large majority of the Melbourne Conservatorium has moved to the Southbank campus alongside the VCA. History The faculty was created in 2009 from the amalgamation of the university's faculty of music (founded as the University Conservatorium in 1895) and faculty of the Victorian College of the Arts. Founded in 1972, the VCA integrated into the University of Melbourne in 2007 as a separate faculty. Due to dissatisfaction ‚Äì particularly from students of the old VCA ‚Äì with the structural changes imposed by the university, in November 2009 former Telstra CEO Ziggy Switkowski was appointed to chair a review. A number of his recommendations were adopted, resulting in the resignation of the inaugural dean,VCA chief quits amid overhaul accessed 4 Feb. 2011 abandonment of the previous push for full amalgamation, the creation of the present divisional structure with a more centralised administration and two relatively distinct teaching entities at the Parkville and Southbank campuses,http://www.artshub.com.au/au/news-article/opinions/performing- arts/vcams-new-conservatorium-of-music-181828 and a change in the title of the head of the two divisions to Director. The appointment of a new Dean under this new structure, occurred in 2011.http://union.unimelb.edu.au/farrago/uni- news/new-dean-appointed-at-vcam This was not the first time, however, that sharing of resources across two institutions had been attempted. In 1974, at the time of the establishment of the VCA School of Music, the original entity called the University Conservatorium was finally unincorporated. Symbolically as well as in practice, the central place of instrumental tuition at the Faculty was removed to the new VCA and replaced with a more academic syllabus.Tregear, Peter, The Conservatorium of Music, University of Melbourne: An Historical Essay to Mark its Centenary, 1895‚Äì1995, University of Melbourne, 1997, p.125 Between 1975 and 1981, the teaching of most woodwind, some brass, double bass and guitar was undertaken by VCA staff at the Southbank campus. Although much work has been done to ensure the autonomy of the VCA, the economic climate of the late 1980s led to a full amalgamation of the VCA and the Faculty of Music that took effect on 1 July 1991. The new organisation was known as the Faculty of Music, Visual and Performing Arts. John Poynter was appointed as dean of the new super faculty. In September, Warren Bebbington was appointed to the vacant Ormond Chair and, at the urging of staff on both sides, worked to reverse the amalgamation, which was effected in 1994.Tregear, The Conservatorium of Music, p.136 On 1 January 2012 the faculty's name was changed to reflect the two operating divisions and is now known as the Faculty of the Victorian College of the Arts and Melbourne Conservatorium of Music (Faculty of the VCA and MCM). On 1 January 2018, the faculty's name was changed again to the Faculty of Fine Arts and Music.

This was due to the worsening condition and lack of space of the original facilities it had been using since it was founded in 1894. Moving to the Southbank campus allows it to be alongside the Victorian College of the Arts in Melbourne's Art Precinct. The relocation and build cost $104.5 million which included the construction of a new 400-plus- seat auditorium as well as a public square, Linear Park. The move was also part of a larger initiative by the Victorian Government (who also contributed funding towards the project) to completely renovate the Southbank Arts Precinct.

Medical use  Cefadroxil is a first- generation cephalosporin antibacterial drug that is the para-hydroxy derivative of cephalexin, and is used similarly in the treatment of mild to moderate susceptible infections such as the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes, causing the disease popularly called strep throat or streptococcal tonsillitis, urinary tract infection, reproductive tract infection, and skin infections. Cefadroxil is used as an antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures, for patients allergic to penicillins. =Spectrum of bacterial resistance and susceptibility= Cefadroxil has a broad spectrum of activity and has been effective in treating bacteria responsible for causing tonsillitis, and infections of the skin and urinary tract. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant microorganisms. * Escherichia coli: 8 Œºg/ml * Staphylococcus aureus: 1 ‚Äì 2 Œºg/ml * Streptococcus pneumoniae: ‚â§1 ‚Äì >16 Œºg/ml http://www.toku-e.com/Assets/MIC/Cefadroxil.pdf  Side effects  The most common side effects of cefadroxil are diarrhea (which, less commonly, may be bloody), nausea, upset stomach, and vomiting. Other side effects include rashes, hives, and itching.  Pharmacokinetics  Cefadroxil is almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. After doses of 500 mg and 1 g by mouth, peak plasma concentrations of about 16 and 30 micrograms/ml, respectively, are obtained after 1.5 to 2.0 hours. Although peak concentrations are similar to those of cefalexin, plasma concentrations are more sustained. Dosage with food does not appear to affect the absorption of cefadroxil. About 20% of cefadroxil is reported to be bound to plasma proteins. Its plasma half-life is about 1.5 hours and is prolonged in patients with renal impairment. Cefadroxil is widely distributed to body tissues and fluids. It crosses the placenta and appears in breast milk. More than 90% of a dose of cefadroxil may be excreted unchanged in the urine within 24 hours by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion; peak urinary concentrations of 1.8 mg/ml have been reported after a dose of 500 mg. Cefadroxil is removed by haemodialysis.  Dosage  Cefadroxil is given by mouth, and doses are expressed in terms of the anhydrous substance; 1.04 g of cefadroxil monohydrate is equivalent to about 1 g of anhydrous cefadroxil.  Veterinary use  It can be used for treating infected wounds on animals. Usually in powder form mixed with water, it has a color and smell similar to Tang. Given orally to animals, the amount is dependent on their weight and severity of infection.

From 1332 to 1340, Count Gerhard was the lord of both Jutland and Funen. His death meant the end of Holstein rule in Denmark. Biography Little is known of Ebbesen's background. He seems to have belonged to the Jutland gentry. Like many other of his class, he probably supported the Holstein occupiers during the years of chaos, but later turned against them and when Count Gerhard campaigned in Jutland in 1340, Ebbesen supported the Jutland guerrillas. On 1 April, 1340 Ebbesen and 47 of his warriors entered Randers and hid until nightfall. They got into the Count's headquarters and entered his bedroom. They cut off the count's head over the end of the bed. Not wishing the act to be secret, Ebbesen's men beat a drum and shouted that the Count had been executed. When the Holsteiners gave chase, Ebbesen and his men fled toward the bridge over the River Guden. Svend Tr√∏st, one of Ebbesen's men had weakened the bridge, and as soon as Ebbesen and his followers had crossed, they pulled the bridge down and made their escape, losing just a single man.Huitfeldt, Arild. Danmarks Riges Kr√∏nike During the following rebellion, Niels Ebbesen played a main role in the resistance but he was killed the same year during a fight against the Germans. 2000 Danes laid siege to Skanderborg Castle in April 1340. A relief force of 600 German knights and a simultaneous attack from the castle drove the Danes back into their wagon fortress on Nun Hill. The ring of wagons was breached, and Ebbesen and his men were surrounded and butchered by the Germans. Legacy Niels Ebbesen, painted by Agnes Slott-M√∏ller in 1893-1894, Randers Museum of Art Traditionally, Niels Ebbesen has been regarded one of the great heroes of medieval Danish history and one of the symbols of Danish nationality. His actions marked the beginning of the liberation of Denmark. Yet others disapproved of his act, regarding it as simply murder. Whether his motives were purely national or partly private is impossible to know. This has not prevented both romantic Danish poetry and modern ballads from praising him as a freedom fighter. A memorial to Niels Ebbesen and his followers was first erected in 1878 at Skanderborg. The Visbycross of stone with a bronze sword was designed by the sculptor Louis Hasselriis (1844‚Äì1912) \\\\- A statue of Niels Ebbesen was erected in 1882 at Randers. It was designed by the sculptor Ferdinand Edvard Ring (1829‚Äì1886). In 1942, during the German occupation of Denmark in the Second World War, a play about Ebbesen's rebellion was written by the dramatist Kaj Munk (1898‚Äì1944). The Nazi occupiers banned the play and murdered its playwright. A ballad (DgF 156, \\"Niels Ebbesen\\") dealing with the killing of Count Gerhard by Ebbesen was translated into English in Alexander Gray's Historical Ballads of Denmark (Edinburgh University Press, 1958).

The Ch√¢teau de Bagatelle is a small Neoclassical style ch√¢teau with several small formal French gardens, a rose garden, and an orangerie. It is set on 59 acres of gardens in French landscape style in the Bois de Boulogne, which is located in the 16th arrondissement of Paris. There is also a located near Abbeville in northern France. Origins The ch√¢teau is a glorified playground, actually a maison de plaisance intended for brief stays while hunting in the Bois de Boulogne in a party atmosphere. The French word bagatelle, from the Italian word bagatella, means a trifle or little decorative nothing. Initially, a small hunting lodge was built on the site for the Mar√©chal d'Estr√©es in 1720. In 1775, the Comte d'Artois, Louis XVI's brother, purchased the property from the Prince de Chimay. The Comte soon had the existing house torn down, with plans to rebuild. Famously, Marie-Antoinette wagered against the Comte, her brother-in-law, that the new ch√¢teau could not be completed within three months. The Comte engaged the neoclassical architect Fran√ßois-Joseph B√©langer to design the building that remains in the park today. The Comte won his bet, completing the house, the only residence ever designed and built expressly for him, in sixty-three days, from September 1777. It is estimated that the project, which came to include manicured gardens, employed eight hundred workers and cost over three million livres. B√©langer's brother-in-law, Jean- D√©mosth√®ne Dugourc, provided much of the decorative detail. The central domed feature was a music-room. The master bedroom was fitted up in the manner of a military tent,This decor was enthusiastically taken up under the Empire. and Hubert Robert executed a set of six Italianate landscapes for the bathroom.Joseph Baillio, \\"Hubert Robert's Decorations for the Ch√¢teau de Bagatelle\\" Metropolitan Museum Journal 27 (1992:149-182). Most of the furnishings were provided by numerous Parisian marchand-merciers, notably Dominique Daguerre, and a decorative painter was A.-L. Delabri√®re.Both men were later established in London, working under Henry Holland at Carlton House (F. J. B. Watson, Louis XVI Furniture 1960:80, 90) and at Southill Park. Motto On the entablature of the entrance facade are inscribed the Latin words Parva sed AptaNominative feminine of adjectives parvus-a-um and aptus-a- um, to agree with missing feminine noun villa, \\"house\\" (\\"Small but suitable\\"), copied from the inscription the Italian poet Ariosto (d. 1533) had inscribed on his modest house at Ferrara. The full inscription read: :Parva sed apta mihi, :Sed nulli obnoxia, sed non Sordida, :Parta meo sed tamen aere domus. One translation in verse reads: :Small is my humble roof, but well designed, :To suit the temper of the master's mind; :Hurtful to none, it boasts a decent pride, :That my poor purse the modest cost supplied. History Plan du Parc de Bagatelle, Paris, France. In 1777, a party was thrown in the recently completed house in honour of Louis XVI and the Queen. The party featured a new table game featuring a small billiard-like table with raised edges and cue sticks, which players used to shoot ivory balls up an inclined playfield with fixed pins. The table game was dubbed \\"bagatelle\\" by the Count and shortly after swept through France, evolving into various forms which eventually culminated in the modern pinball machine. The formal garden spaces surrounding the ch√¢teau, which was linked to its dependencies by tunnels, was expanded with a surrounding park in the naturalistic English landscape style by the Scottish garden-designer Thomas Blaikie, and dotted with sham ruins, an obelisk, a pagoda, primitive hermits' huts and grottoes.Baillio 1992:154 A f√™te given on 20 May 1780, described in Blaikie's diary, gives a sense of the extravagant atmosphere. An additional part of the Bois de Boulogne had recently been taken into the prince's grounds, but the wall remained: Following the Revolution, Napoleon I installed his son the Roi de Rome there, before the ch√¢teau was restored to the Bourbons. In 1835, it was sold by Henry, Count of Chambord to Francis Seymour-Conway, 3rd Marquess of HertfordFor 313,100 francs, having failed to find a purchaser in the preceding years. (H.-G. Duchesne, Le ch√¢teau de Bagatelle (Paris 1909:192f). and was inherited on his death seven years later by his son, the 4th Marquess, who already lived in Paris for most of the year. It contained the largest part of his extensive collection of French paintings, sculptures, furniture and works of decorative art, most of which went to form the Wallace Collection in London. Bagatelle underwent five years of redecorating and extensions, and then Lord Hertford did not reside in it until 1848. Like most of his unentailed property, Bagatelle was left to his illegitimate son Sir Richard Wallace on Lord Hertford's death in 1870, as his entailed property and his title passed to a distant cousin. Bagatelle was acquired from his heir, Sir John Murray-Scott, by the City of Paris in 1905.Taha Al-Douri, \\"The Constitution of Pleasure: Fran√ßois-Joseph Belanger and the Ch√¢teau de Bagatelle\\" RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics, 200. (note 2). The Santos-Dumont 14-bis on an old postcard, flying at the ch√¢teau's grounds The Bagatelle gardens, created by Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier, the Commissioner of Gardens for the city of Paris, are the site of the annual Concours international de roses nouvelles de Bagatelle, an international competition for new roses run by the City of Paris in June of each year. It was first organized in 1907, making it the oldest competition in the world dedicated to this flower. Though the Revolutionary sales emptied the house, at Bagatelle in Sir John Murray- Scott's time were replicas of the bronze vases at Versailles. Upon the sale of the house by Sir John Murray-Scott, the vases were sent to his brother's house, Nether Swell Manor in Gloucestershire. In 1892, the Bagatelle grounds hosted the first French championship match in rugby union, in which local side Racing Club de France, predecessor of today's Racing 92, defeated fellow Parisians Stade Fran√ßais 4‚Äì3. The Bagatelle also played host to some of the polo events for the 1924 Summer Olympics in neighbouring Paris.1924 Olympics official report. p. 528. A number of the aviation experiments conducted by pioneer aviator Alberto Santos-Dumont used the grounds of Bagatelle (), next to the ch√¢teau, as a flying field, most notably the initial flights of his 1906-era Santos-Dumont 14-bis canard biplane.

It has a cylindrical surface, to allow the crankpin to rotate relative to the \\"big end\\" of the connecting rod. The most common configuration is for a crankpin to serve one cylinder. However, many V engines have each crankpin shared by each pair of cylinders.  Design  The crankpin connects to the larger end of the connecting rod for each cylinder. This end of the connecting rod is called the \\"big end\\", as opposed to the \\"small end\\" (which connects to the wrist/gudgeon pin in the piston). The bearing which allows the crankpin to rotate around its shaft is called the \\"rod bearing\\". In automotive engines, the most common type of rod bearing is the plain bearing, however bushings or roller bearings are also used in some engines.  Configurations  In a single-cylinder engine, straight engine or flat engine, each crankpin normally serves just one cylinder. This results for a relatively simple design which is the cheapest to produce. Some V-twin engines use a single cylinder per crankpin. Most V engines have each pair of cylinders sharing a crankpin. This usually requires an offset between the cylinders in each bank, resulting in a simple connecting rod design. If a cylinder offset is not used, then the connecting rods must be articulated or forked at the big end. Forked connecting rods are mainly used in V-twin motorcycle engines, but in the past were found on a number of automobile and aero engines, such as the Rolls-Royce Merlin aero engine of the WWII era. Articulated connecting rods consist of a \\"master\\" rod attached to the crank pin, with a \\"slave\\" rod connected to the big end of master rod. This design was used in older or exotic V engines. Radial engines use a more complicated version of articulated connecting rods, where a single \\"master\\" connecting rod attached to the single crankpin (one for each row in multi-row designs), and smaller bearings for each of the corresponding cylinders machined into the big end of the master rod.

In addition, the overland passage of the Isthmus, a neck of land wide at its narrowest, offered a much shorter route to Athens for ships sailing to and from the Ionian coast of Greece.  History  Excavated western end close to the Gulf of Corinth Ancient literature is silent on the date of the construction of the Diolkos. For Thucydides (460 BC‚Äì395 BC) the Diolkos already seemed to be something ancient. Excavated letters and associated pottery found at the site indicate a construction date at the end of the 7th or beginning of the 6th century BC, that is around the time when Periander was tyrant of Corinth.; ; ; ; The Diolkos remained reportedly in regular service until at least the middle of the 1st century AD, after which no more written references appear. Possibly the trackway was put out of use by Nero's abortive canal works in 67 AD.; Much later transports of warships across the Isthmus in the late 9th century,; and around 1150, are assumed to have used a route other than the Diolkos, due to the extensive time lag.; =Role in warfare= The Diolkos played an important role in ancient naval warfare. Greek historians note several occasions from the 5th to the 1st century BC when warships were hauled across the Isthmus in order to speed up naval campaigning.Although the name of the Diolkos is not explicitly mentioned in these historical sources, its use on these occasions is generally assumed, as the Diolkos existed earlier and was available later. (; ) In 428 BC, the Spartans planned to transport their warships over the Diolkos to the Saronic Gulf to threaten Athens,Thucydides, \\"A History of the Peloponnesian War\\", 3.15.1 while later in the Peloponnesian War, in 411 BC, they carted over a squadron heading quickly for operations at Chios.Thucydides, \\"A History of the Peloponnesian War\\", 8.7‚Äì8 In 220 BC, Demetrius of Pharos had a fleet of about fifty vessels dragged across the Isthmus to the Bay of Corinth by his men.Polybius, \\"Histories\\", 4.19.77‚Äì79 Three years later, a Macedonian fleet of 38 vessels was sent across by Philip V, while the larger warships sailed around Cape Malea.Polybius, \\"Histories\\", 5.101.4 After his victory at Actium in 31 BC, Octavian advanced as fast as possible against Marc Antony by ordering part of his 260 Liburnians to be carried over the Isthmus. In 868 AD, the Byzantine admiral Niketas Oryphas had his whole fleet of one hundred dromons dragged across the Isthmus in a quickly executed operation, but this took place most likely on a different route. =Role in commerce= Despite the frequent mentioning of the Diolkos in connection with military operations, modern scholarship assumes that the prime purpose of the trackway must have been the transport of cargo, considering that warships cannot have needed transporting very often, and ancient historians were always more interested in war than commerce.; ; ; ; Comments by Pliny the Elder and Strabo, which described the Diolkos as being in regular service during times of peace, also imply a commercial use of the trackway. Coinciding with the rise of monumental architecture in Greece, the construction of the Diolkos may have initially served particularly for transporting heavy goods like marble, monoliths and timber to points west and east.; ; It is not known what tolls Corinth could extract from the Diolkos on its territory, but the fact that the trackway was used and maintained long after its construction indicates that it remained for merchant ships an attractive alternative to the trip around Cape Malea for much of antiquity. Structure =Course= Mooring place The Diolkos ran across the narrowest part of the Isthmus, where the trackway followed the local topography in a curved course in order to avoid steeper gradients. The roadway passed the Isthmus ridge at c. height with an average gradient of 1:70 (a 1.43% grade), while the steepest sections rose at a gradient of 1:16.5 (a 6% grade). Its total length is estimated at 6‚Äì7 km (3.7‚Äì4.3 mi), or depending on the number of supposed bends taken into account. A total of has been archaeologically traced, mainly at its western end close to the Bay of Corinth. There the known trackway began at a mooring place south of the more recent canal and ran parallel to the waterway for a few hundred meters, after which it switched to the north side, running in a slight bend a similar distance along the canal. From there on, the Diolkos either followed in a straight line the course of the modern canal, or swung south in a wide arc.; The roadway ended at the Saronic Gulf at the village Schoinos, modern-day Kalamaki, described by Strabo as the trackway's eastern terminal. Sections of the Diolkos have been destroyed by the 19th-century Corinth Canal and other modern installations. =Track and transport= Image of a ship on Attic black-figure pottery (c. 520 BC). This is the sort of boat that the Diolkos may have transported in Periander's time. The Diolkos was a trackway paved with hard limestone with parallel grooves running about apart. The roadway was wide. Since ancient sources tell little about how the ships were hauled across, the mode of ship transport has largely to be reconstructed from the archaeological evidence. The tracks indicate that transport on the Diolkos was done with some sort of wheeled vehicle.; ; Either vessel and cargo were hauled across on separate vehicles, or only the cargo was taken across and reloaded on a different ship at the other side of the Isthmus.; Although a technical analysis has shown that the transport of triremes (25 t, long, beam), albeit difficult, was technically feasible, it is assumed that the vessels were usually smaller boats rather than ships.; To avoid damaging the keel during transport, hypozomata, thick ropes running from bow to stern, to reduce sagging and hogging of the hull, must have been used. Ship and cargo were presumably pulled by men and animals with ropes, tackles and possibly also capstans. The scientist Tolley aimed to establish the manpower needed to haul the vessels over the isthmus ridge. Assuming that a trireme soaked with water weighed 38 tons including its trolley, and that a man can exert a force of 300 N over an extended period of time, the pulling teams‚Äîdepending on the slope and the surface of the cart track‚Äîmust have numbered between 112 and 142 people, with a combined exertion of force of 33 to 42 kN, or around 3.8 tons weight. Bringing the trolley up to speed may have required as many as 180 men. Assuming a speed of 2 km per hour over an estimated length of 6 kilometres, the transfer from sea to sea would have taken three hours to complete. Assuming less load and rolling friction, Raepsaet, in contrast, calculates a maximum pulling force of 27 kN, which would have needed a slightly smaller towing crew. Under these circumstances, the use of harnessed oxen‚Äîwhich has been refuted by Tolley on the basis of their relatively diminished pulling capabilities‚ÄîFor example, according to Tolley, three pairs of oxen can exert only twice as much pulling force as a single one . would have become feasible. However, the necessary expenditure of energy at the Diolkos must be regarded in both scenarios as considerable. =Ancient railway= According to the British historian of science M.J.T. Lewis, the Diolkos represented a railway, in the basic sense of a prepared track which so guides the vehicles running on it that they cannot leave the track. Measuring between and ,; ; remaining in regular and frequent service for at least 650 years, and being open to all on payment, it constituted even a public railway, a concept which according to Lewis did not recur until c. 1800. Also, its average gauge of around is similar to modern standards. However, a close examination of the excavated tracks may give a more differentiated picture. While there is agreement that the grooves in the eastern part were cut deliberately into the stone slabs to guide cart wheels,; ; those in the western section are interpreted by some authors as a result of wear or do not appear at all.; On the other hand, the marked cambers of this road section may point at deliberate tracks as well. Generally, varying forms of the grooves can also be explained by the long period of operation of the Diolkos, during which modifications and repairs must have significantly changed the appearance of the trackway. =Modern exploration= Bank erosion at the western end The chief engineer of the Corinth Canal, B√©la Gerster, conducted extensive research on the topography of the Isthmus, but did not discover the Diolkos. Remains of the ship trackway were probably first identified by the German archaeologist Habbo Gerhard Lolling in the 1883 Baedeker edition. In 1913, James George Frazer reported in his commentary on Pausanias on traces of an ancient trackway across the Isthmus, while parts of the western quay were discovered by Harold North Fowler in 1932. Systematic excavations were finally undertaken by the Greek archaeologist Nikolaos Verdelis between 1956 and 1962,Verdelis, Nikolaos: \\"Le diolkos de L'Isthme\\", Bulletin de Correspondance Hell√©nique, (1957, 1958, 1960, 1961, 1963) and these uncovered a nearly continuous stretch of and traced about in all. Even though Verdelis' excavation reports continue to provide the basis for modern interpretations, his premature death prevented full publication, leaving many open questions concerning the exact nature of the structure.; Additional investigations in situ, meant to complement Verdelis‚Äô work, were later published by Georges Raepsaet and Walter Werner. Today, erosion caused by ship movements on the nearby Canal has left considerable portions of the Diolkos in a poor state, particularly at its excavated western end. Critics who blame the Greek Ministry of Culture for continued inactivity have launched a petition to save and restore the registered archaeological site.

Med II, 58, 54-55 (CMG VI, 1, 1) (c. 320‚Äì400 AD) records two passages from his 1st century AD colleague Xenocrates, in which the latter casually refers to a diolkos close to the harbor of Alexandria which may have been located at the southern tip of the island of Pharos. Another diolkos is mentioned by Ptolemy (90‚Äì168 AD) in his book on geography (IV, 5, 10) as connecting a false mouth of a partly silted up Nile branch with the Mediterranean Sea. Neither Xenocrates nor Ptolemy offers any details on his trackway.

The cluster concept has rapidly attracted attention from governments, consultants, and academics since it was first proposed in 1990 by Michael Porter. Overview Many governments and industry organizations around the globe have turned to this concept in recent years as a means to stimulate urban and rural economic growth. As a result, a large number of cluster initiative organizations were started during the 1990s, and the trend continues. The first comprehensive study of cluster initiatives around the world was reported in the \\"Cluster Initiative Greenbook\\" published by √ñrjan S√∂lvell, Christian Ketels and G√∂ran Lindqvist, with a foreword by Michael Porter. The report was presented at the annual meeting of The Competitiveness Institute, TCI, in Gothenburg in 2003. A follow up study in 2005 covered more than 1400 cluster initiative organizations around the globe. In 2013, a decade after the first Greenbook, The Greenbook 2.0 was launched at the TCI global conference in Kolding, Denmark. While the purpose of cluster initiative organizations is to promote economic development within the cluster by improving the competitiveness of one or several specific business sectors, it is important to differentiate these public-private organizations from policy-making organizations at different levels, e.g., national government units such as the UK Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), and supranational bodies such as the OECD and the European Commission and from industry associations comprising firms within one business sector, e.g., biotech, steel. More specifically, cluster initiatives are organizations or projects that are organized as collaborations between a diverse number of public and private sector actors, such as firms, government agencies, and academic institutions. Whereas lobbying policymakers may be one of the cluster initiative‚Äôs activities, cluster initiatives generally are involved in a broad range of activities, e.g., supply-chain development, market intelligence, incubator services, attraction of foreign direct investment, management training, joint R&D; projects, marketing of the region, and setting technical standards. In June 2007, the European Cluster Observatory was launched. Financed by the European Commission DG Enterprise and Industry, it provides information about clusters, cluster initiatives, and cluster policy throughout 32 European countries. An example of a business cluster from the United Kingdom is the Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC). Information on this cluster and other European Clusters can be found on the European Cluster Observatory. In 2009, under the Competitiveness and Innovation programme, the European Commission launched the European Cluster Excellence Programme from which the European Secretariat for Cluster Analysis (ESCA) was established. ESCA has since worked to spread best practice and improve the professionalism of Cluster managers across Europe by benchmarking, advising on best practice, analysing and accrediting Cluster organisations across the EU. ESCA's work has now extended beyond the borders of the EU including North America and Asia. By October 2014 ESCA had analysed 610 cluster organisations in 35 countries leading to Bronze level labelling. By October 45 Clusters have been awarded the Gold Label. An example of an ESCA Gold label Cluster is the North East of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC). Residential cluster development In the United States, residential cluster development in new housing developments is a means of permanently protecting open space and environmental resources, usually with conservation easements, while still allowing landowners to develop their property. Houses are built closer together on part on the land rather than spread evenly on large lots over the whole development.

It was developed by Parke-Davis as a viable orally-administered AAS with little or no liver toxicity. Pharmacology Most orally administered anabolic steroids function by having an alkylated 17Œ±-carbon atom, which prevents first-pass metabolism by the liver. This approach however results in the AAS having hepatotoxicity. Quinbolone is not 17Œ±-alkylated; instead it has increased oral bioavailability due to its cyclopentenyl ether group. After ingestion, the inactive quinbolone is transformed into boldenone. Quinbolone itself has very few androgenic effects, and most of what it does have are a result of its conversion to boldenone and its metabolites. Because of high doses necessary for androgenic effects, cost and inconvenience meant that quinbolone never proved to be commercially successful, and its clinical applications were fulfilled by alternative, more effective, AAS. Its illicit usage in bodybuilding and athletics likewise proved limited, though drug tests are still used to detect its metabolites as it remains a banned substance for most competitive sports. Quinbolone, via boldenone, can be transformed into estrogens, and hence may have some estrogenic activity. Side effects Chemistry Quinbolone, also known as Œ¥1-testosterone 17Œ≤-cyclopent-1-enyl enol ether or as androsta-1,4-dien-17Œ≤-ol-3-one 17Œ≤-(1-cyclopent-1-ene) enol ether, is a synthetic androstane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is the C17Œ≤ cyclopentyl enol ether of boldenone (Œ¥1-testosterone). A related AAS is boldenone undecylenate (Œ¥1-testosterone 17Œ≤-undec-10-enoate). =Synthesis= Quinbolone can be prepared from testosterone. Dehydrogenation using DDQ forms boldenone.

She has been placed on the National Historic Ships Register and the SS Explorer Preservation Society is currently restoring her in the Edinburgh Dock, Leith. Ship history The FRS Explorer was launched on 21 June 1955 by Lady Rachel Stuart, wife of the Secretary of State for Scotland. Explorer was built by Messrs Alexander Hall & Co., Aberdeen, for the Scottish Home Department; to replace a 1917 built vessel of the same name. The Fishery Research Ship Explorer entered service in 1956 and was operated by the Marine Laboratory in Aberdeen. The role of the Explorer was to investigate fish breeding and feeding grounds so as to establish fishing levels and species types for the British market. In addition pollution and fish diseases that might adversely affect catches were monitored. The classic lines of a Deep Sea Beam Trawler were well suited to working in the traditional fishing grounds, and extra strengthening of the hull prepared her also for service in the Arctic waters off Greenland and Iceland, and the Barents and White Seas north of Russia. From a technological standpoint the vessel represents the zenith of triple-expansion steam technology, which is combined with the very best of Scottish shipbuilding and innovation at a time when shipyards were moving away from traditional methods. The SS Explorer was built using riveted steel to ice-strength classification, but fitted with an aluminium superstructure, and although her main engine was a tried and tested design, a pioneering hybrid diesel-electric power system was installed to power her auxiliaries. SS Explorer also boasted one of the first onboard computers for a vessel of her type, something now commonplace along with diesel-electric hybrid power. In 1984 the first service life of SS Explorer came to an end and she was sold for disposal. The Aberdeen Maritime Museum visited the ship to purchase the engine for exhibition ashore due to its historical importance as it had been the last built in Aberdeen. They were so impressed with the whole vessel though that it was bought complete and towed to the Cromarty Firth while a berth could be negotiated in the city to create a floating heritage attraction. Ten years passed without the museum being able to secure one, so a decision was taken to sell the vessel for scrap. This led to public outcry and the formation of \\"The SS Explorer Preservation Society\\" which aimed to rescue Explorer and preserve it for future generations. Thanks to charitable donations and fundraising, the society was able to purchase the vessel from the ship breakers almost intact. Initial preservation work began while the ship was re-anchored once again in the Cromarty Firth but a secure berth was required. Wildlife, vandals and the harsh weather were taking their toll. In 1996 following an insurance payout as the result of a collision between SS Explorer and an offshore oil support vessel, the Society brought her home to Leith, her port of registry, for restoration. Explorer was added to the National Register of Historic Vessels in 1996.

Pleshcheyev's first book of poetry, published in 1846, made him famous: \\"Step forward! Without fear or doubt...\\" became widely known as \\"a Russian La Marseillaise\\" (and was sung as such, using French melody), \\"Friends' calling...\\" and \\"We're brothers by the way we feel...\\" were also adopted by the mid-1840s' Russian radical youth as revolutionary hymns. In 1849, as a member of Petrashevsky Circle, Pleshcheyev was arrested, sent (alongside Fyodor Dostoyevsky among others) to Saint Petersburg and spent 8 months in Peter and Paul Fortress. Having initially been given a death sentence, Pleshcheyev was then deported to Uralsk, near Orenburg where he spent ten years in exile, serving first as a soldier, later as a junior officer. In his latter life, Pleshcheyev became widely known for his numerous translations (mostly from English and French) and also poems for children, some of which are now considered classic. Many of Pleshcheyev's poems have been set to music (by Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff among others) to become popular Russian romances. Biography Alexey Nikolayevich Plescheev was born in Kostroma on 4 December, an heir to a noble family with ancient history and fine literary tradition. Among the future poet's ancestors were St. Alexis of Moscow and the 18th century writer Sergey Ivanovich Plescheev.Yuri Zobnin. Dmitry Merezhkovsky: Life and Moskow. Molodaya Gvardya. 2008. . ZhZL (Lives of Distinguished People) Series, Issue 1291 (1091). P.101 Alexey's father Nikolai Sergeevich Plescheev was a state official, employed by Olonets, Vologda and Arkhangelsk governors. He received a good home education and at the age of 13 joined the military school in Saint Petersburg. He left in 1834 without graduating and enrolled at Saint Petersburg University to study Oriental languages. Among his friends in Saint Petersburg were Fyodor Dostoyevsky, brothers Apollon and Valerian Maykovs, Andrey Krayevsky, Ivan Goncharov, Dmitry Grigorovich and Mikhail Saltykov- Schedrin. It was to one of his older friends, the rector of Saint Petersburg University Pyotr Pletnyov, that Pleshcheev sent his first collection of verse, receiving warm support. In 1845, infatuated with Socialist ideas, Pleshcheev joined the Petrashevsky Circle which included several writers ‚Äì notably Dostoyevsky, Sergey Durov and Nikolay Speshnev, the latter exerting an especially strong influence upon the young man.Nikolai Bannikov. Alexey Pleshcheev. Poems. Sovetskaya Rossia Publishers. Introduction. p.9 Pleshcheev wrote agitators' poetry (he was perceived by others in the circle as \\"our very own Andr√© Ch√©nier\\") and delivered manuscripts of banned books to his comrades. In tandem with N.A.Mordvinov he translated the \\"Word of a Believer\\" by F.-R. de Lamennais which the Circle was planning to print and publish illegally. In 1845 due to financial difficulties, Pleshcheev left the University. In 1846 his first collection of poetry was published, including \\"Step forward! Without fear or doubt...\\" (Vperyod! Bez strakha y somnenya...) which quickly gained the reputation of a Russian La Marseillaise. The book resonated strongly with the Russian cultural elite's mood and Plescheev acquired the status of a revolutionary poet, whose mission was to \\"profess the inevitable triumph of truth, love and brotherhood.\\"Otechestvennye Zapiski, 1846. ‚Ññ 10. Vol. IV. pp. 39‚Äì40Valerian Maykov. Literary Criticism. Leningrad. 1985. pp. 272‚Äì278. In 1847‚Äì1849 Pleshcheev's poems along with some prose, started to appear in magazines, notably, Otechestvennye Zapiski. Full of Aesopian language, some of them have still been credited as the first-ever reaction to the French Revolution of 1848 in the Russian literature. In an 1888 letter to Chekhov Pleshcheev remembered: In the late 1840s Pleshcheev started to publish short stories and novelets. A natural school piece called \\"The Prank\\" (Shalost, 1848) bore evident Gogol influence, while \\"Friendly Advice\\" (Druzheskiye sovety, 1849) resembled \\"White Nights\\" by Dostoyevsky, the latter dedicated, incidentally, to Pleshcheev.V.L. Komarovich. The Youth of Dostoyevsky. The Past anthology. 1924. ‚Ññ 23. In the late 1848 Plescheev started to invite members of the Petrashevsky Circle to his home. He belonged to the moderate flank of the organization, being skeptical about republican ideas and seeing Socialism as a continuation of the old humanist basics of Christianity.P.N. Sakulin. Alexey Nikolayevich Pleshcheev (1825‚Äì1893). // The History of the Russian 19th-century Literature. Moscow. Mir Publishers. 1911. Vol. 3. pp. 482‚Äì483 In the spring of 1849 Pleshcheev sent a copy of the officially banned Vissarion Belinsky's letter to Gogol. The message was intercepted and on 8 April he was arrested in Moscow, then transported to Saint Petersburg. After spending nine months in the Petropavlovskaya fortress Pleshcheev found himself among 21 people sentenced to death. On 22 December, with other convicts, he was brought to the Semyonov Platz where, after a mock execution ceremony (later described in full detail by Dostoyevsky in his novel The Idiot), was given 4 years of hard labour. This verdict was softened and soon Pleshcheev went to the town of Uralsk where he joined the Special Orenburg Corps as a soldier, starting the service that lasted eight years. Initially life in exile for him was hard and return to writing was out of question. Things changed when Count Perovsky, his mother's old friend, has learnt of the poet's plight and became his patron. Pleshcheev got access to books and stroke several friendships, notably with the family of Colonel Dandeville (whose wife he fell in love with, leaving several poems dedicated to her), Taras Shevchenko, radical poet Mikhail Mikhaylov and a group of Polish exiles, among them Zygmunt Sierakowski. According to the latter's biographer, the circle's members discussed such questions as granting freedom to peasants and the abolition of corporal punishment in the Russian army.J. Kowalski. Rewolucyjna demokracja rosyjska a powstanie styczniowe. W., 1955, str. 148. In March 1853 Pleshcheev asked to be transferred to the 4th infantry battalion and took part in several Turkestan expeditions endeavored by General Perovsky, participating in the siege of the Ak-Mechet fortress in Kokand. He was honoured for bravery and promoted to the rank of junior officer, then in 1856 was granted permission to become a civil servant. In May 1856 Pleshcheev retired from the Army, joined the Orenburg borderline Commission, then in September 1858 moved into the office of the Orenburg civil Governor's chancellery. That year he got a permission to visit Moscow and Saint Petersburg (making this 4 months trip with his wife Elikonda Rudneva whom he married a year later) and was returned all the privileges of hereditary dvoryanin he was stripped of eight years earlier. Pleshcheyev in 1850s In exile Pleshcheev resumed writing: his new poems appeared in 1856 in The Russian Messenger under the common title Old Songs Sung in a New Way (Starye pesni na novy lad). In 1858, ten years on after the debut one, his second collection of verses was issued, a stand-out being the piece called \\"On Reading Newspapers\\", an anti-Crimean War message, in tune with the feelings common among the Ukrainian and Polish political exiles of the time. The collection's major themes were the author's feelings towards \\"his enslaved motherland\\" and the need for spiritual awakening of a common Russian man, with his unthinking, passive attitude towards life. Nikolai Dobrolyubov later reviewed the book with great sympathy and affection.Nikolai Dobrolyubov. Works in 4 volumes. Moscow. 1950/ Vol. 1. Pp. 620, 623. Then there was another long pause. Not a single poem from the 1849‚Äì1851 period remained and in 1853 Pleshcheev conceded he felt like he \\"was now forgetting how to write.\\" In August 1859 Pleshcheev returned from his exile, settled in Moscow and started to contribute to Sovremennik, having maintained through the mutual friend Mikhail Mikhaylov strong personal contacts with Nekrasov, Chernyshevsky and Dobrolyubov. His works were also published by magazines Russkoye Slovo (1859‚Äì1854), Vremya (1861‚Äì1862) and Vek (1861), newspapers Denh (1861‚Äì1862) and Moskovsky Vestnik. In the late 1850s Pleshcheev started to publish prose, among his better known works being The Inheritance (Nasledstvo, 1857), Father and Daughter (Otets y dotch, 1857), Budnev (1858), Pashintsev (1859) and Two Careers (Dve Karjery, 1859), the latter three vaguely autobiographical novelets. In 1860 A.N.Pleshcheev's Novelets and Shorts Stories in 2 volumes came out, followed by two more collections of poetry, in 1861 and 1863, where he got closer to what scholars later describes as the \\"Nekrasov school\\" of protest verse. Contemporaries described him as a 'totally 1840s man' full of romanticism mixed with vague ideas of social justice. This alienated him from the emerging pragmatic radicals of the 1860s, and Pleshcheev admitted as much. \\"One is supposed to pronounce his very own New Word, but where it is supposed to come from?\\" he wondered, in a letter to Dostoyevsky. In December 1859 he was elected a member of the Russian Literary Society. A month earlier he joined the staff of Moskovsky Vestnik newspaper seeing it as his mission to make the paper an ally of Saint Petersburg's Sovremennik, and for almost two years was its editor-in- chief. Pleshcheev's translations of \\"Dreams\\" (Sny) by Taras Shevtchenko was this paper's most politically charged publication. Pleshcheev continued contributing to Sovremennik up until the magazine's demise in 1866. His Moscow home became the center of literary and musical parties with people like Nikolai Nekrasov, Ivan Turgenev, Leo Tolstoy, Aleksey Pisemsky, Anton Rubinstein, Pyotr Tchaikovsky and actors of Maly Theatre attending regularly.The 1860s anthology, p. 454Russkaya Mysl, 1913, ‚Ññ 1, —Ä. 149. In the early 1860s, Pleshcheev started to criticise the 1861 reforms which he initially was enthusiastic about and severed all ties with Mikhail Katkov's The Russian Messenger. His poetry became more radical, its leitmotif being the high mission of a revolutionary suffering from the society's indifference. The secret police in its reports mentioned Pleshcheev as a 'political conspirator' and in 1863 searched his house hoping to find evidence of his links with Zemlya i volya. There remained no documents supporting the case for Pleshcheev being Zemlya i volya member, but both Pyotr Boborykin and Maria Sleptsova later insisted that not only was he the active member of the underground revolutionary circle but kept printing facilities in his Moscow home where the Young Russia manifest has been printed. By the end of the decade almost all of his friends have been either dead or imprisoned and Pleshcheev (who in 1864 even had to join Moscow Postal office revision department) could see for himself no way to continue as a professional writer. Things started to change in 1868 when Nikolai Nekrasov, now the head of Otechestvennye Zapiski, invited Pleshcheev to move to Saint Petersburg and take the post of the reformed journal's secretary. After Nekrasov's death Pleshcheev became the head of the poetry department and remained in OZ up until 1884. Pleshcheyev's portrait by Nikolai Yaroshenko. As the magazine got closed, Pleshcheev became active as a Severny Vestnik organizer, the magazine he stayed with until 1890, helping a lot (with money, too) young authors like Ivan Surikov (who at one point was close to suicide), Garshin, Serafimovich, Nadson and Merezhkovsky. In the 1870s and 1880s Pleshcheev made a lot of important translations from German, French and English and several Slavic languages. Among the works he translated were \\"Ratcliff\\" by Heinrich Heine, \\"Magdalene\\" by Hebbel, \\"Struenze\\" by Michael Behr. Stendhal's Le Rouge et le Noir and √âmile Zola's Le Ventre de Paris were first published in Pleshcheev's translations. In 1887 The Complete A.N.Pleshcheev was published, re-issued in posthumously, in 1894 by the poet's son. Pleshcheev has been deeply engaged with the Russian theatre, was a friend of Alexander Ostrovsky and a one time the administrator of the Artistic Circle, an active member of the Russian Dramatist Society. He wrote thirteen original plays, most of them satirical miniatures dealing with the everyday life of a Russian rural gentry. Some of them (The Good Turn, Every Cloud Has Its Silver Lining, both 1860; The Happy Couple, The Woman Commander, both 1862; As It Often Happens, Brothers, both 1864) were produced by major Russian theatres. He adapted for stage productions more than thirty comedies of foreign authors. Pleshcheev's poetry for children, compiled in collections Snowdrop (1878) and Grandpa's Songs (1891), became immensely popular and for decades was featured in Russian textbooks. In 1861 with Fyodor Berg he compiled and published the Book for Children, then in 1873 (with N.A.Alekseev) another children's literary anthology, A Holiday Reading. He initiated the project involving the publication of seven textbooks in the Geography Sketches and Pictures. Many of Pleshcheev's poems were set to music by composers like Rimsky-Korsakov, Musorgsky, C√©sar Cui, Grechaninov, Rakhmaninov and Tchaikovsky. The latter praised his children's cycle and cited it as a major source of inspiration. Among romances composed by Thaikovsky based on Pleshcheev's verses were \\"Oh, Not a Word, My Friend\\" (1869), \\"Sing Me the Same Song\\" (1872), \\"Only You\\" (1884), \\"If Only You'd Knew and Meekly Stars Were Shining Upon Us\\" (1886). Of Tchaikovsky's 16 Songs for Children (1883) 14 had Pleshcheev's lyrics. =Last years= Not long before his death, in 1890, Pleshcheev inherited a fortune from his Penza relative Aleksey Pavlovich Pleshchhev. He's settled in the Parisian \\"Mirabeau\\" hotel with two of his daughters and started to invite his literary friends to guest with him, organising sight-seeing and restaurant tours around the city. According to Zinaida Gippius, he's never changed (except for losing weight due to the progressing illness), \\"received this manna with noble indifference and remained the same cordial host we've known him for being when he lived in a tiny flat on Preobrazhenskaya square...\\" \\"What use wealth could be for me? Thankfully, now my children are saved from poverty and I myself can have a breath of air before I die,\\" he was saying, according to Gippius. Pleshcheev has donated money to the Russian Literary Fund, himself organized two funds, naming them after Belinsky and Chernyshevsky. He supported financially the families of Gleb Uspensky and Semyon Nadson and started to finance Russkoye Slovo, a magazine edited by Nikolai Mikhaylovsky and Vladimir Korolenko. One of his best friends in the later years Anton Chekhov was not a fan of Pleshcheev the poet but admired him as a person, viewing him as a \\"relic of the Old Russia\\". In July 1892 Pleshcheev informed Chekhov that his left arm and leg were now paralyzed. In Autumn 1893, severely ill, Pleshcheev attempted to make a travel to Nice, France, and died on the road, from a stroke. His body was taken to Moscow and he was buried in the Novodevichye Cemetery. The Russian authorities prohibited all kinds of obituaries, but huge a crowd, mainly of young people, gathered at the funeral, some of them (like Konstantin Balmont who pronounced a farewell speech) were to become well known years later.

Development The J33 was originally developed by General Electric as a follow-on to their work with the designs of Frank Whittle during World War II. Their first engine was known as the General Electric I-A, but after major changes to adapt it to US production and to increase thrust, it started limited production as the I-16 in 1942, the 16 referring to its thrust. Full production started as the J31 when the United States Army Air Forces introduced common naming for all their engine projects. Along with the I-16, GE also started work on an enlarged version, known as the I-40. As the name implied, the engine was designed to provide . Apart from size, the main difference between I-16 and the I-40 was the combustion system: the I-16 had ten reverse-flow cans, whereas the I-40 had 14 straight-through combustors. The development cycle was remarkably rapid. Design work started in mid-1943 and the first prototype underwent static testing on 13 January 1944. Lockheed was in the midst of the XP-80 project at the time, originally intending to power their design with a US-produced version of the Halford H-1 of about . Production of the H-1 by Allis-Chalmers ran into delays, and since the I-40 would dramatically improve performance, plans were made to fit the prototypes with the I-40 instead. The I-40 became important to the USAAF's plans when the I-16 powered P-59 was skipped over in favor of the I-40 powered P-80 as the US's first production jet fighter. In 1945, the license to actually produce the engine was not given to General Electric, but to Allison instead. Allison, working largely from government-owned wartime factories, could produce the engine in quantity more quickly and cheaply. By the time the production lines were shut down, Allison had built over 6,600 J33's and General Electric another 300 (mostly the early runs). In 1958, surplus J33s were used in jet donkeys pushing dead loads at 200 knots to test aircraft carrier arresting gear cables and tailhooks at Lakehurst. A model of the J33 intended for civil use, designated the Allison 400-C4, in 1948 became the first US gas turbine certificated for commercial transport use.

It had an intermediate station at Coleshill, which was renamed Maxstoke in 1923. The railway opened on 12 August 1839 as part of the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway (B&DJR;). It was a key part of that company's route from the North Midlands and Yorkshire, to connect with the London and Birmingham Railway (L&BR;) and the South East. The line to Birmingham Lawley Street opened on 10 February 1842. After a period of fierce competition between the B&DJR; and the Midland Counties Railway (MCR) for the coal traffic to London (the MCR had a shorter route that joined with the L&BR; at Rugby), the two merged, with the North Midland Railway, to form the Midland Railway. As all the London traffic was now diverted on the former MCR route, the Stonebridge Railway lost all strategic importance and became in effect a minor branch line. When originally opened, the Stonebridge Railway was a double tracked main line, though the second running line was removed in 1843. This is believed to be the first \\"singling\\" (downgrading a railway to single track operation) in railway history. Even after the line was singled, until February 1845, two of the three daily services each way carried through coaches to London. The daily service was reduced from three trains to two in 1859, and from May 1877 the service was reduced to a Parliamentary train service of a single morning train in each direction. This being the minimum level of service required by law. This lasted until 1917, when the passenger service was finally withdrawn as a wartime economy measure, while under government control (but not ownership) during the First World War. The line continued in use for freight until 1935 when it was officially closed, following a bridge failure in Packington. However, the track at the northern end remained in place, and was used as a siding for the storage of disabled wagons between the mid 1930s and 1951, when the track was finally removed. The Hampton end track had become a minor siding, and was lifted in 1963. Two of the most famous men in the history of the Midland Railway were associated with this line - Sir James Joseph Allport (who started his career as a traffic agent in Hampden in Arden), and Matthew Kirtley (who was once the locomotive superintendent of the B&DJR;). Samuel Carter was solicitor. Proposed reopening In June 2013 a ¬£240 million to ¬£280 million plan was proposed to re-open the Stonebridge Railway in order to link Coventry and Birmingham Airport to an interchange station on the proposed High Speed 2 London-Birmingham line. As of January 2014, the proposal has the support of Bob Ainsworth and Christopher Pincher (Members of Parliament for Coventry North East and Tamworth), Paul Kehoe (chief executive of Birmingham Airport), Geoff Inskip, (chief executive of Centro), Birmingham City Council and Transport Minister Stephen Hammond. The Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, also pledged in January 2014 to invest directly in the ¬£50bn HS2 project. China Railway Group had offered to build the connections from the proposed interchange in Birmingham to the city‚Äôs airport and along to cities including Coventry and Peterborough. The 11.7 kilometres (7.3 miles) link would run from Hampton-in-Arden, near Solihull to Whitacre Junction, in North Warwickshire. The 15-mile journey between Tamworth and Birmingham Airport takes 45 minutes by rail, but the \\"Whitacre rail link\\" would in theory reduce the journey time to 18 minutes. As of 2014, no further development has been made. In January 2019, Campaign for Better Transport released a report identifying the line which was listed as Priority 2 for reopening.

Milne, Jacobian Varieties, Theorem 12.1 in From more precise information on the constructed isomorphism of the curves it follows that if the canonically principally polarized Jacobian varieties of curves of genus \\\\geq 2 are k-isomorphic for k any perfect field, so are the curves.James S. Milne, Jacobian Varieties, Corollary 12.2 in This result has had many important extensions. It can be recast to read that a certain natural morphism, the period mapping, from the moduli space of curves of a fixed genus, to a moduli space of abelian varieties, is injective (on geometric points). Generalizations are in two directions. Firstly, to geometric questions about that morphism, for example the local Torelli theorem. Secondly, to other period mappings.

He was previously bass guitarist with the pioneering heavy metal outfit Buffalo from 1971 to 1976. Wells also had a solo career and issued albums, Everything You Like Tries to Kill You (1991), The Meaning of Life (1992), No Hard Feelings (1993), Orphans (1994), Go Ahead, Call the Cops (1996), It's All Fun and Games 'till Somebody Gets Hurt (1999), Hateball (2000) and Solo (2002). In 2002 he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and, on 27 March 2006, Wells died of the disease, aged 59. Rose Tattoo were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame on 16 August of that same year.  Biography  = Early years to Buffalo = Peter William Wells, was born on 31 December 1946. In 1966 he was the bass guitarist of The Odd Colours with Ronnie Hausert, Steve Jones, Eddy Staarink, and Dave Tice on lead vocals. His next group was Strange Brew (1966‚Äì67) with Tice and Ray Frost. In Brisbane in 1968 Wells, Jones on drums, and Tice formed a blues band, Head (1968‚Äì71), with Neil Jensen on guitar and Peter Leighton. By mid-1970 Wells, as a member of Head, had moved to Sydney. In early 1971 Jones was replaced in the group by Paul Balbi on drums and Jensen made way for John Baxter on guitar. In August 1971 Wells, Balbi, Baxter and Tice were joined by Alan Milano on co-lead vocals (ex-Mandala) to form Buffalo as a heavy rock group. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, describes Buffalo as \\"one of Australia's pioneering heavy rock outfits ... Alongside Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs and Blackfeather, Buffalo was one of the loudest and heaviest bands of the day\\". Wells remained with Buffalo for their albums, Dead Forever... (June 1972), Volcanic Rock (July 1973), Only Want You for Your Body (June 1974) and Mother's Choice (March 1976). He also appeared on three tracks of their posthumous album, Average Rock 'n' Roller (July 1977). As a member of Buffalo Wells co-wrote the album tracks: \\"Leader\\" (1972), \\"Pound of Flesh\\" (1973), \\"On My Way\\" and \\"Essukay\\" (both 1976). = Rose Tattoo (1976‚Äì1983) = In 1976, Wells, initially on bass guitar, formed another hard rock band, Rose Tattoo, with Leigh Johnston on rhythm guitar, Tony Lake on lead vocals and Michael Vandersluys on drums. They were soon joined by Ian Rilen on bass guitar so that Wells could focus on slide guitar. According to Australian rock music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, Wells had \\"decided to form the band that became Rose Tattoo, decided on their style of boogie and blues music, and their street look, united by their tattooed bodies\\". Further line-up changes resulted in Lake being replaced by Angry Anderson on lead vocals, Mick Cocks taking over from Johnston on rhythm guitar, and in 1977 Dallas Royall substituting for Vandersluys on drums. Their \\"peerless, street-level heavy blues with the emphasis on slide guitar\\" style had developed a strong following leading to Albert Productions offering them a record contract. Their debut single, \\"Bad Boy for Love\\" (October 1977), became a top 20 hit on the Kent Music Report. In November of the next year their self-titled debut album established their reputation with production by Alberts' in-house producers, George Young and Harry Vanda, formerly of The Easybeats. Rilen left the band to be replaced by former Buster Brown bass guitarist, Geordie Leach. After the release of their second album, Assault and Battery (September 1981), the group embarked on an international tour. They were the loudest band to play at the Marquee Club in London since Led Zeppelin. Upon their return to Australia Robin Riley replaced Cocks on guitar. After the release of their third album Scarred for Life (November 1982), the band supported Aerosmith and then ZZ Top for several dates while on a three-month tour of North America. Wells, Riley and Royall all left Rose Tattoo in early 1983. For Rose Tattoo, Wells co-wrote at least 17 tracks, including the single, \\"One of the Boys\\" (1978). = $cattered Aces to Heart Attack (1983‚Äì1990) = In August 1983 Wells, on guitar, formed Scattered Aces (styled as $cattered Aces) with Paul De Marco aka Fred Zeppelin on drums (ex-Chris Turner Band); Ronnie Peel aka Rockwell T. James on bass guitar and lead vocals (ex-The Missing Links, Pleazers, Rockwell T. James & the Rhythm Aces, The La De Das, John Paul Young & the All Stars, Cheetah); and former Buffalo bandmate, Chris Turner, on guitar and vocals (ex- Drain, Buffalo, Rockwell T. James & the Rhythm Aces). The group issued a six- track extended play, Six Pack, on Big Rock Records in April 1984. They followed with a cover version of Eddie Cochran's 1958 song, \\"C'mon Everybody\\", as a single but they had broken up by mid-1984. In November 1984 Wells established Illustrated Men, with former Rose Tattoo members, Cocks on guitar (ex-Heaven by then), Leach on bass guitar, Rilen on lead vocals (X), and Royall on drums. The group \\"played loud, barnstorming rock'n'roll\\" but was \\"designed to be a short-term touring venture\\". They toured into 1985 performing material largely written by Rilen before disbanding. Wells and Leach (aka Fast Eddie) joined a blues group, Lucy De Soto Band, with De Soto (aka Patricia Anne Clements) on lead vocals, piano and Hammond organ (ex- Living Daylights, Fat Time); and Ross Mercer on drums. Their debut album, Three Girls and a Sailor, appeared in 1985. They followed with a second album, Help Me Rhonda, My Boyfriend's Back, in August of the next year. By that time the line up was Wells, De Soto, Leach and Charlie Watts on drums. For the next three years, Wells and De Soto, lived \\"in the foothills behind the Gold Coast ... in semi-retirement\\". Wells, De Marco, Peel and Turner briefly performed as Slightly Shadey in 1987. In January 1990 Wells and De Soto established another group, Heart Attack, with Cocks, De Marco and Mick Strutt on bass guitar. In March they supported Hitmen DTK on a national tour, Kathryn Whitfield of The Canberra Times noted that Heart Attack \\"consists of well-known Australian musicians who simply refuse to take holidays (or in some cases, retire)\\" and Wells \\"takes centre stage also assuming the role of vocalist\\". = Early solo work to Blues Hangover (1990‚Äì1996) = By mid-1990 Wells began recording his debut solo album, Everything You Like Tries to Kill You (late 1990), which \\"gave full vent to Wells' wry, sardonic world-view\\". Wells and De Soto co- wrote eight of ten tracks. Wells supplied banjo, dobro, guitars (lead, acoustic, bass, electric, slide and steel), harmonica and lead vocals; while De Soto provided keyboards, organ (Hammond), percussion, piano, and both lead and background vocals. They used session musicians including Stuart Fraser on guitars, drums and vocals (from Noiseworks); Jim Hilbun on backing vocals (from The Angels); Mark Meyer on drums (ex-Richard Clapton Band, Moving Pictures, Mark Gillespie Band); Ted Pepper on saxophone; and Jon Stevens on backing vocals (from Noiseworks). It was produced by Fraser, Stevens and Kevin Shirley (Lime Spiders) for the Big Stars label and distributed by Mushroom Records. According to McFarlane the album had \\"mixed country, bluesy boogies and laid-back rock'n'roll\\". To support the release Wells and De Soto formed the Pete Wells Band in 1991 but \\"played raunchy, traditional Aussie pub rock\\". The early line-up included Wells on guitar, slide guitar and lead vocals; De Soto on piano, keyboards and backing vocals; Warwick Fraser on drums (ex- Feather, The Screaming Tribesmen); Tim Gaze on lead guitar (ex-Tamam Shud, Kahvas Jute, Ariel, Rose Tattoo); and Michael Vidale on bass guitar (ex-Jimmy and the Boys). In August that year Wells produced the debut album, Nightstreet, by AOR band, Roxus. It peaked at No. 5 on the ARIA Albums Chart. His second solo album, The Meaning of Life, appeared in July of the following year, which was \\"more straight-up rock'n'blues\\". It was co-produced by Fraser and Stevens. In the studio he used De Soto, Gaze and Strutt with Bernie Bremond on saxophone (ex-Johnny Diesel and the Injectors) and Scott Johnson on drums (ex-Jimmy and the Boys, Rose Tattoo). Wells also worked on side projects including Rocks Push with Turner and Rob Grosser. Early in 1993 Wells rejoined Rose Tattoo with the line-up of Anderson, Cocks and Leach adding De Marco as their new drummer. During the brief reunion they supported two gigs by United States group, Guns N' Roses, on the Australian leg of their Use Your Illusion Tour. Rose Tattoo also played solo shows on their own pub tour. In 1994 Hillbilly Moon formed with Wells on lead vocals, lead and bass guitars; Cletis Carr on the same instruments; and Paul Norton on the same instruments plus drums. They issued an album, Volume One, in that year on Pelican Records in Australia, and Blue Rose Records in Europe. In 1996, they recorded a second album, Volume Two, which remains unreleased, save for one track that appeared on an ABC Music compilation, Open Road II. His third solo album, No Hard Feelings, appeared in June 1993 and was recorded with De Soto, Bremond, De Marco and Leach. It was co-produced by Wells and De Soto for ATI Records and Mushroom Records. In August that year it was followed by a four-track EP, Hard Done by You, co-credited to Peter Wells, Dave Steel (ex-Weddings Parties Anything), Bob Armstrong. In late 1994 Wells and De Soto reactivated Pete Wells Band with Turner and were joined by Mark Evans on bass guitar (ex-AC/DC, Finch, Heaven) and Mick O'Shea on drums (ex-Swanee, Judge Mercy). In the next year the line-up with Wells and De Soto were Cocks, De Marco and Andy Cichon on bass guitar (ex-Rose Tattoo, James Reyne Band, Judge Mercy). Wells issued his fourth solo album, Orphans, in June that year, which was co-produced by Wells and De Soto. Wells and De Soto travelled to Germany to work with a studio band, Romeo Dog, which recorded a self-titled album. Fellow musicians were Cichon, O'Shea and Andy Anderson on lead vocals. The album appeared in 1996, McFarlane noted that their sound \\"mixed raucous bar-room blues with hard rock grunt\\". Before its release Wells and De Soto had returned to Australia and, in Melbourne, worked with an R&B; outfit, Blues Hangover, which included Ken Farmer on drums; Dave Hogan on vocals and harmonica; and Warren Rough guitar (all from The Paramount Trio); plus John Stax on bass guitar (ex-The Pretty Things). They issued their self-titled album in 1995 and a second album, Roadrunner, in the next year both on the Dog Meat label. McFarlane felt the releases showed a \\"passionate, gritty brand of R&B;\\". = Later solo work and side projects (1996‚Äì2006) = In 1996 Wells and De Soto recruited Tim Hemensley on bass guitar and Timmy Jack Ray on drums (both from Powder Monkeys) to fill out another version of Pete Wells Band. They recorded an album, Go Ahead Call the Cops, which was produced by the band and issued in October that year on Dog Meat and Shock Records. During 1998 and the following year, Wells toured in Rose Tattoo as well as working on his solo material. His next album, Its All Fun & Games 'til Somebody Gets Hurt, appeared in February 1999, which was produced by Wells and De Soto. McFarlane felt was \\"another rough‚Äôn‚Äôtumble collection of blues‚Äôn‚Äôboogie bar band rock\\". In November that year he contributed to De Soto's next album, Take this Veil, which was issued on the Full Moon label. Wells and De Soto worked on another Pete Wells Band album, Hateball (2000), before Wells teamed with Angry Anderson to release Damn Fine Band in 2001. Pete Wells Band issued their next album, Solo in the following February on MGM. Also in July year Rose Tattoo, with Wells aboard, released a reunion album, Pain. In 2004 Wells and De Soto formed Lucy De Soto and the Handsome Devils which focused on blues with Wells on slide guitar, De Soto on lead vocals and piano, and Grosser on drums. They issued a self-titled album in that year and soon followed with two more albums, Low Down and Travelling and Whiskey Dance. In September 2004 the Pete Wells Band issued their next album, Mother's Worry. Wells died of prostate cancer on 27 March 2006, although another solo album, Greetings from the Aloha Monkey, appeared in May that year. Another posthumous album, Bodgie Dada (April 2008), had been recorded by Wells, De Soto and Grosser in December 2005.  Personal life  Since 1985 Peter Wells worked professionally with his good friend Lucy De Soto (aka Patricia Anne Clements). By the late 1980s they were living together. They continued to work as fellow band members, co-composers, co-producers and on each other's solo projects and other works. Wells moved with Lucy from Melbourne back to Sydney in the late 1990s where he worked in the tattoo parlour, House of Pain in Annandale, ran by Steve King (Rose Tattoo bass player from 2000). In 2002 Wells was diagnosed with prostate cancer but it was inoperable. Australian musicians played benefit gigs for him in September and October 2005 including Rose Tattoo, Peter Garrett, The Beasts of Bourbon, Tex, Don and Charlie, Paul Kelly and Tim Rogers and the Temperance Union. Wells was too weak to play a full set with Rose Tattoo but joined them on \\"Bad Boy for Love\\". Wells died on 27 March 2006, aged 59, from the disease, which had spread to other parts of his body. He had been hospitalised for the previous five weeks \\"suffering much pain\\". His daughter, Katrina Kennedy, provided a eulogy at St Brendan's Church in Annandale. Other eulogies were delivered by David Tice (former bandmate) and his brother-in-law, Greg Young. His funeral was attended by fellow band members and musicians. His band, Rose Tattoo, was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame on 16 August of the same year. A week before he died Wells was visited in hospital by members of Rose Tattoo, he told them to continue recording their next album, Blood Brothers (February 2007).

He is one of a group of saints canonized by Pope Paul VI who became known as the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales. Early life and education Barlow Hall, 1910 Ambrose was born at Barlow Hall, Chorlton-cum-Hardy, near Manchester in 1585 (in the parish of Manchester).Saint Ambrose Barlow His life, times and relics David W. Atherton and Michael P. Peyton, 2014 He was the fourth son of the nobleman Sir Alexander Barlow and his wife Mary, daughter of Sir Urian Brereton of Handforth Hall.Camm, Bede (1907). \\"Ven. Edward Ambrose Barlow\\". The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton. Retrieved 10 September 2013. The Barlow family had been reluctant converts to the Church of England following the suppression of the Catholic Church in England and Wales. Ambrose's grandfather died in 1584 whilst imprisoned for his beliefs and Sir Alexander Barlow had two thirds of his estate confiscated as a result of his refusing to conform with the rules of the new established religion. On 30 November 1585, Ambrose was baptised at Didsbury Chapel and his baptism entry reads \\"Edwarde legal sonne of Alex' Barlowe gent' 30\\". Ambrose went on to adhere to the Anglican faith until 1607, when he converted to Roman Catholicism. Baptism Record of Ambrose Barlow In 1597, Ambrose was taken into the stewardship of Sir Uryan Legh, a relative who would care for him whilst he served out his apprenticeship as a page. However, upon completing this service, Barlow realised that his true vocation was for the priesthood, so he travelled to Douai in France to study at the English College there before attending the Royal College of Saint Alban in Valladolid, Spain. In 1615, he returned to Douai where he became a member of the Order of Saint Benedict, joining the community of St Gregory the Great (now Downside Abbey), and was ordained as a priest in 1617. Mission Wardley Hall After his ordination into the priesthood, Ambrose returned to Barlow Hall, before taking up residence at the home of Sir Thomas Tyldesley, Morleys Hall, Astley. Sir Thomas' grandmother had arranged for a pension to be made available to the priest which would enable him to carry out his priestly duties amongst the poor Catholics within his parish. From there he secretly catered for the needs of Catholic 'parishioners', offering daily Mass and reciting his Office and Rosary for the next twenty-four years. To avoid detection by the Protestant authorities, he devised a four-week routine in which he travelled throughout the parish for four weeks and then remained within the Hall for five weeks. He would often visit his cousins, the Downes, at their residence of Wardley Hall and conduct Mass for the gathered congregation. Arrest and execution Ambrose was arrested four times during his travels and released without charge.\\"St Ambrose Barlow, 10th September\\", Diocese of Shrewsbury King Charles I signed a proclamation on 7 March 1641, which decreed that all priests should leave the country within one calendar month or face being arrested and treated as traitors, resulting in imprisonment or death. Ambrose's parishioners implored him to flee or at least go into hiding but he refused. Their fears were compounded by a recent stroke which had resulted in the 56-year-old priest being partially paralysed. \\"Let them fear that have anything to lose which they are unwilling to part with\\", he told them. Lancaster Castle On 25 April 1641, Easter Day, Ambrose and his congregation of around 150 people were surrounded at Morleys Hall, Astley by the Vicar of Leigh and his armed congregation of some 400. Father Ambrose surrendered, and his parishioners were released after their names had been recorded. The priest was restrained, then taken on a horse with a man behind him to prevent his falling, and escorted by a band of sixty people to the Justice of the Peace at Winwick, before being transported to Lancaster Castle. Father Ambrose appeared before the presiding judge, Sir Robert Heath, on 7 September when he professed his adherence to the Catholic faith and defended his actions. On 8 September, the feast of the Nativity of Mary, Sir Robert Heath found Ambrose guilty and sentenced him to be executed. Two days later, he was taken from Lancaster Castle, drawn on a hurdle to the place of execution, hanged, dismembered, quartered, and boiled in oil. His head was afterwards exposed on a pike. His cousin, Francis Downes, Lord of Wardley Hall, a devout Catholic rescued his skull and preserved it at Wardley where it remains to this day. It is not the skull of Roger Downes of that same family, the libertine and friend of the Earl of Rochester. When the news of his death and martyrdom reached his Benedictine brothers at Douai Abbey, a Mass of Thanksgiving and the Te Deum were ordered to be sung. Canonisation On 15 December 1929, Pope Pius XI proclaimed Father Ambrose as Blessed at his Beatification ceremony at St. Peter's Basilica, Vatican City. In recognition of the large number of British Catholic martyrs who were executed during the Reformation, most during the reign of Elizabeth I, Pope Paul VI decreed that on 25 October 1970 he was canonising a number of people who were to be known as the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales of whom Ambrose was one.St. Ambrose Barlow Ministered in England in secret for 24 years Hagiography and relics Church of St Ambrose of Milan, Chorlton-cum-Hardy The blue plaque outside Manchester Cathedral Challoner (see below) compiled Barlow's biography from two manuscripts belonging to St Gregory's Monastery, one of which was written by his brother Dom Rudesind Barlow, President of the English Benedictine Congregation. A third manuscript, titled \\"The Apostolical Life of Ambrose Barlow\\", was written by one of his pupils for Dom Rudesind, and is in the John Rylands Library, Manchester; it has been printed by the Chetham Society. Two portraits of Barlow and one of his father, Sir Alexander, are known to exist. Several relics of Ambrose are also preserved; his jaw bone is held at the Church of St Ambrose of Milan, Barlow Moor, Manchester; one of his hands is preserved at Stanbrook Abbey now at Wass, North Yorkshire, and another hand is at Mount Angel Abbey in St. Benedict, Oregon; and his skull is preserved on the stairwell at Wardley Hall in Worsley, the one time home of the Downes family, and now the home of the Catholic Bishop of Salford. Legacy St Ambrose Barlow Church in Astley The church of St Ambrose of Milan at Barlow Moor is in the parish of his birthplace. It was founded in 1932, and is dedicated to St Ambrose of Milan but changed to St Ambrose Barlow at his canonisation. St Ambrose Barlow Roman Catholic church and primary school in Astley is also named after Ambrose. Other schools named after the saint include The Barlow Roman Catholic High School in Didsbury, St Ambrose Barlow Roman Catholic High School in Swinton near Manchester, and St Ambrose Barlow Catholic High School in Netherton, Merseyside. One of the boarding houses at Downside School is named Barlow in his honour. An Oblate Chapter (association of secular Benedictines) of Douai Abbey, meeting at St Anne's Roman Catholic Church in Ormskirk, has St Ambrose Barlow as its patron.

Investigations address a wide range of interactions between air, water, soil, life and climate in the course of Earth history up to today¬¥s human-driven epoch, the Anthropocene. The Institute consists of five scientific departments (Atmospheric Chemistry, Climate Geochemistry, Biogeochemistry, Multiphase Chemistry, and Particle Chemistry) and additional research groups. The departments are independently led by their Directors.  Research  The Institute consists of five scientific departments and additional research groups. * Atmospheric Chemistry Department: The Atmospheric Chemistry Department which is led by Prof. Dr. Jos Lelieveld focuses on the study of ozone and other atmospheric photo-oxidants, their chemical reactions and global cycles. The researchers use kinetic and photochemical laboratory investigations, in situ and remote sensing measurements. The Atmospheric Chemistry department also develops numerical models to describe meteorological and chemical processes in the atmosphere, to simulate the complex atmospheric interactions and to test the theory through measurement campaigns (ground-based or by ship, aircraft, satellite). Research groups: **Reactive Processes (John Crowley) **Optical Spectroscopy (Horst Fischer) **Radical Measurements (Hartwig Harder) **Organic Reactive Species (Jonathan Williams) **Research Group of Andrea Pozzer * Biogeochemistry Department: The Department Biogeochemistry of Prof. Dr. Meinrat O. Andreae concentrates on the exchange and interactions of trace gases and aerosols between biosphere and atmosphere with a special focus on Amazon region. They use laboratory investigations, field measurements and numerical models to study this processes. Research topics are: exchange of chemically and climatically important trace gases between the soil/vegetation system and the atmosphere, formation of aerosol particles and their effects on climate, impact of vegetation fires on ecology and atmospheric pollution, and the changing global cycles of trace elements. * Department of Climate Geochemistry: Prof. (ETHZ) Dr. Gerald H. Haug and his team explore the climate -ocean-atmosphere system on annual up to geological timescales. Of particular interest is the Cenozoic (the past 65 million years). They investigate the changes in internal feedback processes, e.g. interactions between ocean and atmosphere, oceanic heat transport or its nutrient status. Moreover, the scientists study the biogeochemical processes in the polar oceans and their role in regulating atmospheric CO2 concentration between ice ages and warmer periods. Therefore, they examine geological archives such as sediments from the open ocean and speleothems. The department operates the Research sail yacht S/Y Eugen Seibold. Research groups: **Isotope Biogeochemistry (Stephen Galer) **Paleoclimate Research (Klaus P. Jochum) **Organic Isotope Geochemistry (Alfredo Mart√≠nez-Garc√≠a) **Geosientific databases (B√§rbel Sarbas) **Micropaleontology (Ralf Schiebel) **Inorganic Gas Isotope Geochemistry (Hubert Vonhof) * Multiphase Chemistry Department: The department of Prof. Dr. Ulrich P√∂schl deals with multiphase processes at the molecular level and its impact on the macroscopic and global scale. Concerning the Earth System and climate research, they focus on biological and organic aerosols, aerosol-cloud interactions and atmospheric surface exchange processes whereas in the field of life and health sciences, the researchers study the change of protein macromolecules air pollution and how this affects allergic reactions and diseases. Research groups: **Biomolecular Analyses & Interactions (J. Fr√∂hlich) **Organic Pollutants & Exposure (G. Lammel) **Inflammatory Processes (K. Lucas) **Aerosol analysis & Microscopy (C. P√∂hlker) **Multiscale Interactions & Integration (U. P√∂schl) **Aerosol, Cloud & Surface Interactions (H. Su) **Microbial Communities & Processes (B. Weber) **Multiphase Chemical Kinetics and Reaction Mechanisms (T. Berkemeier) **Cloud Condensation Nuclei (M. P√∂hlker) **Radical and Redox Chemistry (H. Tong) * Particle Chemistry Department: The department is led by Prof. Dr. Stephan Borrmann. Here they study the physical properties and chemical composition of atmospheric aerosol and cloud particles using laboratory experiments (e.g. in a vertical wind tunnel), measurements on ground and hill stations and on mobile measurement facilities (airplanes). Furthermore, extraterrestrial particles are being analyzed using isotopic measurements, such as presolar grains from meteorites and comets. Research groups: **Instrumental Aerosol Analytics (Frank Drewnick) **NAMIP - Nano- and Microparticle Research (Peter Hoppe) **Aerosol and Cloud Chemistry (Johannes Schneider) **Atmospheric Hydrometeors (Mikl√≥s Szak√°ll and Karoline Diehl) **Aerosol and Cloud Physics (Stefan Borrmann, Ralf Weigel and Jacob Fugal) **AEROTROP (Christiane Voigt) * Further research groups: In December 2016 there were four additional research groups at the Institute: The Minerva group led by Dr. Yafang Cheng. They deal with the interaction of aerosols and regional air quality. Dr. Mikhail Eremets studies mater at high pressures. Prof. Dr. Thomas Wagner and his Satellite Research Group of analyzes satellite data in order to draw conclusions about tropospheric and stratospheric trace gases. The group \\"Terrestrial Paleoclimates\\" which is led by Dr. Kathryn Fitzsimmons, uses loess in Eurasia as climate archives for information of past climates. * In 2010 the Geochemistry department (which was led by Prof. Albrecht W. Hofmann) was closed and the scientific working groups were integrated into the Biogeochemistry department. This department conducted research on large-scale geological processes, such as the formation of continental and oceanic crusts, the chemical differentiation of the Earth's mantle and the circulation of present-day and former oceans. The scientists used mass spectrometric measurements of isotopic abundances to determine the absolute age of rocks. They also used isotopic abundances and trace element contents to determine the origin of volcanic lava from the Earth's mantle or crust and studies the long-term processes used by the Earth's mantle to recycle old crust.  History  The Institute was founded as Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry in Berlin Dahlem in 1911. The founding director was Ernst Beckmann (1853-1923), who also directed the Department of Inorganic and Physical Chemistry. The Department of Organic Chemistry was led by Richard Willstatter (1872-1942), who won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1915 for his work on plant pigments. The teamwork of Otto Hahn (1879-1968), Lise Meitner (1878-1968) and Fritz Stra√ümann (1902-1980) led to the discovery of nuclear fission in December 1938. Otto Hahn was Director of the Institute from 1928 to 1946. He received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1944. During the war, in 1944, the Institute building was severely damaged as a result of air raids. Everything that hadn't been destroyed was then stored in a closed textile factory in Tailfingen, W√ºrttemberg (present-day Albstadt), where the Institute continued the work it had started in Berlin for a time. After World War II the institute moved to the campus of Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz in 1949. In 1948 the Kaiser Wilhelm Society was restructured and renamed becoming the Max Planck Society, the institute was also renamed as the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry (1949). In order to adapt to changing scientific requirements, the institute's research activities changed several times over the years. When classic chemistry was practiced in the early years, it later focussed on Radiochemistry, Cosmochemistry, Nuclear Physics, and mass spectrometry. These days the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry focusses on an integral scientific understanding of chemical processes in the Earth System from molecular to global scales.  Nobel laureates of the institute  * Richard Willst√§tter, director from 1912 till 1916. In 1915, he received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his research into plant dyes, primarily chlorophyll. He discovered, among other things, that the structure of green dye exhibits significant similarity to the structure of the red blood pigment hemoglobin. * Otto Hahn, director of the department for radioactive research from 1912 till 1948, from 1928 till 1946 managing director of the institute. The joint research by Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner and Fritz Stra√ümann into transuranic elements led to the discovery of nuclear fission in 1938. In 1945, Otto Hahn received the Nobel Prize for this. * Paul J. Crutzen, Director of the Atmospheric Chemistry Department from 1980 till 2000, Nobel Prize for Chemistry 1995 for investigations on the formation and destruction of ozone in the atmosphere.  Staff  At the beginning of 2014 about 300 people were employed at the institute, including 77 scientists, 122 junior scientists and 11 trainees (mechanical workshop and electronics).  Max Planck Graduate School (MPGS)  The Max Planck Graduate School (MPGS) at MPI for Chemistry offers a PhD program in atmospheric chemistry and physics, environmental physics and geophysics. The program should enable the PhD students to widen their knowledge and skills beyond the research topic of the doctoral project by visiting different lectures, workshops, soft skill courses, an annual PhD Symposium and summer schools. It was established by the Max Planck Society in January 2003. The Graduate School is in close cooperation with the University of Mainz (Institute for Physics of the Atmosphere), the University of Heidelberg (Institute for Environmental Physics), University of Frankfurt (Institute for Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences).

It encompasses the Max-Planck-Institutes for Biogeochemistry in Jena, MPI for Chemistry in Mainz and MPI for Meteorology in Hamburg. Over the last century, marked changes in climate, air quality, biodiversity, and water availability occurred. More and potentially more rapid changes are predicted. To find solutions to the challenges these changes pose, the ESRP studies the complex interactions and feedbacks of land, ocean, atmosphere, biosphere and humans in the field, the lab and through models. * ATTO: \\"ATTO\\" stands for Amazonian Tall Tower Observatory. The German-Brazilian joint project was launched in 2009 and is coordinated by the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry. The tower aims at delivering groundbreaking findings which will be the basis for improved climate models. With a height of 300 meters the tower will extend the ground-level boundary layer, and will provide information taken from approximately 100 squarekilometers from the world¬¥s largest forest area. ATTO is the counterpart of the 2006 completed ZOTTO tower that stands in Siberia and the Max Planck Institute of Chemistry is also involved. ATTO will integrated into an existing structure of smaller Brazilian measuring towers. The cost for the construction of ATTO including the first five years of running costs is estimated to be 8.4 million ‚Ç¨. which will be financed by Germany and Brazil in equal parts. * HALO: HALO - The High Altitude and LOng Range Research Aircraft is a Research Aircraft for atmospheric research and earth observation of the German Science Community. HALO is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, the Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft and the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft. * IBBI: Interdisciplinary Biomass Burning Initiative (IBBI) * CARIBIC: Global Atmospheric Composition and Climate Change Research EUROPE's SOLUTION FOR GLOBAL ATMOSPHERE MONITORING. CARIBIC is an innovative scientific project to study and monitor important chemical and physical processes in the Earth¬¥s atmosphere. Detailed and extensive measurements are made during long distance flights. Since October 2015 the CARIBIC project has moved to the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and the Institute of Meteorology and Climate Research - Atmospheric Trace Gases and Remote Sensing.  Databases  The institute provides two geochemical databases which give information about reference materials of geological and environmental interest (GeoReM) and about volcanic rocks and mantle xenoliths (GEOROC).

Paul Stewart lives in the British seaside city of Brighton with his wife and children.  Background  Paul Stewart was born in London in 1955. His family lived first in Muswell Hill, North London and later in Morden, South London, where he went to school. His favourite subject at school was English and he hated Mathematics. When Paul left school, he went travelling, spending several months in Greece, where he took various jobs, including picking oranges and grapes, and whitewashing hotels. From 1974 to 1977, Paul studied at the University of Lancaster, majoring in English, (which included a Creative Writing unit) with a minor in Religious Education. On graduation, he went travelling again, before enrolling in 1978 to do an M.A. in Creative Writing with Angela Carter and Malcolm Bradbury at the University of East Anglia. He went to Heidelberg, Germany in 1979 for three years, both as a teacher of English and as a student at Heidelberg University, learning German. In 1982, he went to Sri Lanka to teach English as a foreign language returning to the UK a year later where he continued to teach (1983‚Äì90) before becoming a full- time writer. Paul Stewart's first book to be published was The Thought Domain (1988) which was then followed by a number of other children's and young adult novels, chiefly in the thriller, horror and SF/Fantasy genres. Paul Stewart's only adult book to date, Trek, was published in 1991.  Literary influences  Paul Stewart's favourite books when a child were The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster, Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, Rupert Bear Annuals, and the works of Alan Garner, especially Elidor. He also read a lot of science fiction. Paul Stewart started writing at a very young age. At the age of seven he was writing a series about a snail called Oliver and he started a sequel to The Phantom Tollbooth at ten. Some of the ideas from this early work were later developed and became the basis of The Thought Domain which was published in 1988. Collaboration with Chris Riddell Riddell in 2010 Paul Stewart first met Chris Riddell in 1993, through having children at the same school. Chris was looking for someone to write texts that he could illustrate. Paul had already had a number of books published. Their first collaborative work were the Rabbit and Hedgehog books (published 1998‚Äì2003 by Andersen Press). The inspiration for The Edge Chronicles came from a map Chris Riddell drew of an imaginary world in 1994 and then challenged Paul to write about it. The first book in the sequence, Beyond the Deepwoods, was commissioned by Transworld Publishers (now part of the Random House Group) on the basis of the map and the first four chapters. The book then took three years to write as Paul and Chris worked out both the plot and how best to work together. Originally commissioned as a single book, Paul and Chris hoped that it might become a trilogy. The series has now extended to fifteen full-length novels, five short stories, a book of maps and a now-defunct blog called Weird New Worlds. The final book, The Descenders, was released in 2019. When writing together, Paul and Chris work on the development of plots and characters together, sometimes starting from a bit of writing, sometimes from an illustration on one of Chris's sketchbooks. They have long conversations over many days, during which the novels emerge. They don't always agree and the debates can become quite heated but they have remained good friends. Following these discussions, Paul normally writes a first draft, which Chris will edit or rewrite before Paul produces a final draft. As well as The Edge Chronicles, Paul Stewart and Chris Riddell have also collaborated on a trilogy of shorter adventures, Freelance; a quartet of younger books, The Far Flung Adventures, the first of which, Fergus Crane, won the Nestle Smarties Gold Prize in 2004; The Blobheads series (2000‚Äì2004); Muddle Earth (2003), and a further quartet, Barnaby Grimes (2007‚Äì2009). Their latest novel, Wyrmweald, was published by Doubleday Children's Books in April 2010.  Awards  These three books constitute the Far Flung Adventures series, written by Stewart and illustrated by Riddell. * 2004 Smarties Prize Gold Medal, age category 6‚Äì8 years: Fergus Crane Smarties Prize * 2005 Smarties Prize Silver Medal, 6‚Äì8 years: Corby Flood * 2006 Smarties Prize Silver Medal, 6‚Äì8 years: Hugo Pepper  Bibliography  =Fiction= *The Thought Domain, illustrated by Jon Riley.

Their one childhood memory of their mother is that of a medicated cold bed-bound woman, whose only words were that \\"in this world Sheng is the only one Ling can rely on and Ling is the only one Sheng can rely on\\". One day Ling meets Qi Luo, an introvert and a gentle girl, in a park where he asks her for directions. She draws the directions for Ling on the back of one of her sketches of a mother and child.

It later became part of Multi- National Security Transition Command - Iraq (MNSTC-I). CMATT had initial plans to stand up nine infantry brigades in three divisions, a coastal defense force, and lay the framework of an aviation arm of the military. Among CMATT's goals were developing a force that was: * under political control, * accountable to the nation, and * defensive in capability Additionally, CMATT advisors established (or reestablished) Iraqi Army Infantry, logistics, administration, medical services, signals, and military police schools. In 2004, a small Air Cell was established within the CMATT, made up of coalition officers, to guide the creation of the reborn Iraqi Air Force. Advisory Support Teams were formed at Basra, Kirkuk, Taji, and Talil to build capacity within the new Iraqi air units. Dissolution CMATT was dissolved after the establishment of MNSTC-I in June-July 2004. The initial aim for the New Iraqi Army, of developing U.S. style mechanized divisions to defend the country from invasion from its surrounding neighbors, had to change to developing the necessary security forces to protect the Iraqi population from the Iraqi insurgency. The Air Cell was replaced, as part of MNSTC-I, with the Coalition Air Force Transition Team, established on 18 November 2005.

Covering 125 ha, the lake was built in 1868 on what was known as Swampy Plains and was named after Prince Albert. Surrounded by parkland, the lake is a venue for water sports, fishing, walking and bird watching. The lake is home to the Boat Club and one of the town's two golf courses, Wagga Wagga Country Club, is situated on the western shore of the lake. History =Events= Barry Carne Memorial Ski Race in May 2006. Dead and dying European carp in the lake. On 8‚Äì9 May 1976, the Water Ski Challenge Shield was held on the lake for the first time which was formed by Zone 5 of the New South Wales Ski Association and the Wagga Boat Club. On 9 May 1976, Australian Ski and Victorian trial champion, Barry Carne from the Melbourne suburb of Lower Templestowe, died when he collapsed and cart wheeled up to twelve times during the sixth lap of the final heat of the ski challenge. The Barry Carne Memorial Ski Race was held on the second Saturday and Sunday in May of each year, subject to water levels in the lake. On 13 and 14 May 2006 the event returned to Lake Albert after a 4-year absence due to the lake being at record low levels owing to drought but was cancelled in 2007 due to low water levels. On 12 May 2009, due to the low water levels in the lake the Barry Carne High and Dry event was held. In March 2010 it was announced that Barry Carne Memorial Ski Race would return to the lake on 3rd Saturday and Sunday in May, after record breaking rain had filled that lake. =Water levels= Due to years of drought the water level at Lake Albert reached record lows and in 2005 Wagga Wagga City Council considered pumping water into the lake to prevent further fish deaths which was ruled out by a senior council official. After a thunderstorm dumped around in the area the lake reached its full depth in early November 2005. In January 2007, a ban on water sport activities on Lake Albert was likely if the lake's water level drops below due to the ongoing drought. On 20 March 2008, the lake was closed for the second time since January 2008 due to high levels of Faecal Coliforms in the water. In January 2010, the lake's water levels were at record lows with a large amount of fish, mostly European carp, dying due to the low water levels, blue-green algae and hot weather. With the low water levels and dying fish, residents around the lake fear that a mosquitoes outbreak is possible which could see an outbreak of the Ross River fever. The lake was expected to be almost dried up by the end of March, however heavy rain fell over the area in mid February which had slightly raised the lake's water level after falling to . Record breaking rains in the catchment on 7 March had raised the lakes level to , the deepest level since 2006. =Silt removal= On 23 March 2009, local businesses volunteered time and equipment with the Wagga Wagga City Council paying $30,000 in fuel costs, began to remove silt on the northern end of the lake with of silt to be removed and used at the Wagga Wagga Exhibition Centre (Equex) for spectator mounds.

critic. Biography Apukhtin was born in Bolkhov and came from an ancient noble family. While yet a child, he betrayed an astounding memory and a fondness for reading, especially of poetry. By the age of ten, he knew by heart the works of Pushkin and Lermontov. Besides these, his favorite poets and authors of later years were Griboyedov, Baratynsky, Tyutchev, Fet, A. Tolstoy, L. Tolstoy, Turgenev, Dostoyevsky and Ostrovsky. In 1852, aged only 11, he entered the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg, where he was a class mate of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, who was his exact contemporary and became a lifelong friend. The founder, duke Peter of Oldenburg, and the director, Alexander Yazykov, took him under their personal wings.Poznansky, pp. 40-41 He graduated with distinction in 1859. His work was encouraged by Turgenev and Fet. While he was polite and courteous in the company of women, he became a witty storyteller in the company of men. His conversation was \\"imbued with such wit and clothed in such attractive form that for the sake of this alone one forgot the frivolity of the contents\\".Memoirs of Vassily Bertenson, a physician, quoted in Poznansy, 123 He was seen as a boy genius and a second Pushkin. But his output failed to live up to these early expectations, and he expressed little interest in making any money from his writings. It was only in the face of lack of funds that he made any attempt to publish his poems, giving many of them as gifts to his friends, from whom they were later retrieved for a posthumous collected edition. His friendship with Tchaikovsky was marked by cycles of disagreements and offences followed by reconciliations.Poznansky, pp. 93, 122 Apukhtin dedicated several poems to Tchaikovsky. Like Tchaikovsky, Apukhtin was homosexual with a weakness for younger men, and often suffered the pain of unrequited love. But unlike Tchaikovsky, who never publicly acknowledged his sexual interests in other men, Apukhtin lived openly with his male lovers. His sexual tastes were discussed in society and ridiculed in the press.Poznansky, pp. 40-46, 92, 123, 362 He entered the civil service as a member of the Ministry of Justice. After two years retirement in the country (1862‚Äì64), he became associated with the Ministry of the Interior. He spent most of his life in St. Petersburg. Apukhtin may have played a role in introducing Tchaikovsky to his future wife Antonina Milyukova. One of Apukhtin's friends was the singer Anastasia Khvostova, who was Antonina's brother's sister-in-law. Tchaikovsky first met Antonina at a soiree at Anastasia's home in 1865, when she was only 16.Poznansky, p. 205 In 1892, Tchaikovsky issued a warning to his beloved nephew Vladimir \\"Bob\\" Davydov to be wary of Apukhtin's interest in him. He was concerned that Apukhtin would seduce him, which was a source of jealousy as Davydov was also the subject of Tchaikovsky's unspoken sexual interest.Poznansky, p. 547 Aleksey Apukhtin suffered from obesity, shortness of breath and dropsy. He died in Saint Petersburg on 29 August 1893, aged 52. Grand Duke Konstantin suggested Tchaikovsky compose a requiem in honour of Apukhtin, set to Apukhtin's poem of the same name, but he declined, saying he had just completed his 6th Symphony, which was imbued with a mood similar to that in the poem, and he feared repeating himself so soon, but also because he had no desire to write any sort of Requiem.Poznansky, p. 569 Tchaikovsky himself was to die suddenly just over two months later. Work Following the traditions of amorous gypsy romance, he introduced into this genre much of his own artistic temperament. Six of his romances were set to music by Tchaikovsky These includedTo forget so soon, Does the day reign and Frenzied nights. Sergei Rachmaninoff was another composer who set Apukhtin's words to music. Apukhtin's reputation as a poet was further strengthened in 1886, when his Poems collection was published. In 1890 he published several prose works: Unfinished Story, Archive of the Countess D., Pavlik Dolsky's Diary. His prose was well regarded by Mikhail Bulgakov.

The term was popularized by , and especially by Eleanor Rosch in her investigations of the acquisition of so-called basic categories (;). Definition of cue validity Formally, the cue validity of a feature f_i\\\\ with respect to category c_j\\\\ has been defined in the following ways: * As the conditional probability p(c_jf_i)\\\\ ; see , , . * As the deviation of the conditional probability from the category base rate, p(c_jf_i)-p(c_j)\\\\ ; see , . * As a function of the linear correlation; see , , , . * Other definitions; see , . For the definitions based on probability, a high cue validity for a given feature means that the feature or attribute is more diagnostic of the class membership than a feature with low cue validity. Thus, a high-cue validity feature is one which conveys more information about the category or class variable, and may thus be considered as more useful for identifying objects as belonging to that category. Thus, high cue validity expresses high feature informativeness. For the definitions based on linear correlation, the expression of \\"informativeness\\" captured by the cue validity measure is not the full expression of the feature's informativeness (as in mutual information, for example), but only that portion of its informativeness that is expressed in a linear relationship. For some purposes, a bilateral measure such as the mutual information or category utility is more appropriate than the cue validity. Examples As an example, consider the domain of \\"numbers\\" and allow that every number has an attribute (i.e., a cue) named \\"\`is_positive_integer\`\\", which we call f_{p\\\\mbox{-}int}\\\\ , and which adopts the value 1 if the number is actually a positive integer. Then we can inquire what the validity of this cue is with regard to the following classes: {\`rational number\`, \`irrational number\`, \`even integer\`}: * If we know that a number is a positive integer we know that it is a rational number. Thus, p(c_{rational}f_{p\\\\mbox{-}int}) = 1\\\\ , the cue validity for \`is_positive_integer\` as a cue for the category \`rational number\` is 1. * If we know that a number is a positive integer then we know that it is not an irrational number. Thus, p(c_{irrational}f_{p\\\\mbox{-}int}) = 0\\\\ , the cue validity for \`is_positive_integer\` as a cue for the category \`irrational number\` is 0. * If we know only that a number is a positive integer, then its chances of being even or odd are 50-50 (there being the same number of even and odd integers). Thus, p(c_{even}f_{p\\\\mbox{-}int}) = 0.5\\\\ , the cue validity for \`is_positive_integer\` as a cue for the category \`even integer\` is 0.5, meaning that the attribute \`is_positive_integer\` is entirely uninformative about the number's membership in the class \`even integer\`. In perception, \\"cue validity\\" is often short for ecological validity of a perceptual cue, and is defined as a correlation rather than a probability (see above). In this definition, an uninformative perceptual cue has an ecological validity of 0 rather than 0.5. Use of the cue validity In much of the work on modeling human category learning, there has been the assumption made (and sometimes validated) that attentional weighting tracks the cue validity, or tracks some related measure of feature informativeness. This would imply that attributes are differently weighted by the perceptual system; informative or high-cue validity attributes being weighted more heavily, while uninformative or low-cue validity attributes are weighted more lightly or ignored altogether (see, e.g., Navarro 1998).

This allows mapping of variable length, higher-layer client signals over a circuit switched transport network like OTN, SDH/SONET or PDH. The client signals can be protocol data unit (PDU) oriented (like IP/PPP or Ethernet Media Access Control) or can be block-code oriented (like Fibre Channel). There are two modes of GFP: Generic Framing Procedure - Framed (GFP-F) and Generic Framing Procedure - Transparent (GFP-T): * GFP-F maps each client frame into a single GFP frame. GFP-F is used where the client signal is framed or packetized by the client protocol. * GFP-T, on the other hand, allows mapping of multiple 8B/10B block-coded client data streams into an efficient 64B/65B block code for transport within a GFP frame. GFP utilizes a length/HEC-based frame delineation mechanism that is more robust than that used by High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC), which is single octet flag based. There are two types of GFP frames: a GFP client frame and a GFP control frame. A GFP client frame can be further classified as either a client data frame or a client management frame. The former is used to transport client data, while the latter is used to transport point-to-point management information like loss of signal, etc. Client management frames can be differentiated from the client data frames based on the payload type indicator. The GFP control frame currently consists only of a core header field with no payload area. This frame is used to compensate for the gaps between the client signal where the transport medium has a higher capacity than the client signal, and is better known as an idle frame. Frame format A GFP frame consists of: * a core headers * a payload header * an optional extension header * a GFP payload * an optional payload frame check sequence (FCS). Modes * Framed GFP (GFP-F) is optimized for bandwidth efficiency at the expense of latency. It encapsulates complete Ethernet (or other types of) frames with a GFP header. * Transparent GFP (GFP-T) is used for low latency transport of block-coded client signals such as Gigabit Ethernet, Fibre Channel, ESCON, FiCON, and Digital Video Broadcast (DVB). In this mode, small groups of 8B/10B symbols are transmitted rather than waiting for a complete frame of data.

It contains a six-membered ring with two adjacent nitrogen atoms, and is aromatic. It is a colorless liquid with a boiling point of 208 ¬∞C. It is isomeric with two other (CH)4N2 rings, pyrimidine and pyrazine. Occurrence Pyridazines are rare in nature, possibly reflecting the scarcity of naturally occurring hydrazines, common building blocks for the synthesis of these heterocycles. The pyridazine structure is a popular pharmacophore which is found within a number of herbicides such as credazine, pyridafol and pyridate. It is also found within the structure of several drugs such as cefozopran, cadralazine, minaprine, pipofezine, and hydralazine. Synthesis In the course of his classic investigation on the Fischer indole synthesis, Emil Fischer prepared the first pyridazine via the condensation of phenylhydrazine and levulinic acid. The parent heterocycle was first prepared by oxidation of benzocinnoline to the pyridazinetetracarboxylic acid followed by decarboxylation. A better route to this otherwise esoteric compound starts with the maleic hydrazide. These heterocycles are often prepared via condensation of 1,4-diketones or 4-ketoacids with hydrazines.

The original manuscript was found during 1650, walled in behind the altar of Skibby Church (Skibby Kirke). It was printed in Latin 1773 and translated into Danish 1890-1891. History It was found in Skibby Church (Skibby Kirke) in North Zealand, Denmark. It is anonymous but according to many historians, the author was the outstanding humanist Poul Helgesen (Latin: Paulus Helie). Formally the work covers the period 1047-1534, but the main part covers events during the reigns of King Christian II and King Frederick I. The work is a sometimes very personal description of Danish history during the last decades of Roman Catholicism, marked by the author‚Äôs sympathy for and (mainly) antipathy against the political actors. Especially his portrait of Christian II is a very subjective one, affected by his negative attitude to the king‚Äôs anti- aristocratic policy and his use of violence. Also Frederick I, regarded by Helgesen as a traitor to the Roman Catholic cause, is harshly treated. The description ends abruptly during the Count‚Äôs War (1534‚Äì36), perhaps because of Helgesen‚Äôs death ca. 1534. Formally the chronicle is built up very much like the annals, which means that great and small events are often mentioned together ‚Äì deaths among the local clergy alternating with battles and wars ‚Äì but it often contains valuable material. For instance, the nobility‚Äôs letter of complaint over Christian II is repeated. In general the chronicle reflects the author‚Äôs bitterness, sorrow and frustration because of the course of events. His hot temper often breaks through, invectives and personal injuries reveal a man who was deeply engaged in the struggle. His hatred toward the Protestant agitators is just as outspoken as is his contempt and indignation at the last Roman Catholic bishops and their behaviour. In spite of this subjectivity, the chronicle makes an interesting picture of pre-Reformation Denmark viewed through the eyes of a disillusioned Reform Roman Catholic.

The D.P.A. requires significant coursework beyond the masters level and a dissertation that contributes to theory or practice. Upon successful completion, the title of \\"Doctor\\" is awarded and the post-nominal letters of D.P.A. or DPA can be used. Overview Like a Ph.D., a D.P.A. is normally a terminal research degree. The U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) recognize the D.P.A. as an academically equivalent degree to the more common Ph.D. and they do not discriminate between the two degrees. In many cases, D.P.A. programs are identical to Ph.D. programs. Additionally, the D.P.A. dissertation is usually at the same level as a Ph.D. in terms of effort, rigor, contribution to knowledge, supervision and assessment. A study published by the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration titled What's in a Name? Comparing DPA and Ph.D. Programs concluded that there was \\"few differences between the programs, noting that degree title is more informative about the type of students recruited than outputs\\" D.P.A. research is both theoretical and practical, but the research focus of the typical D.P.A. addresses applied issues, with the results providing professional outcomes that are of direct relevance to practice. While also intended to prepare graduates for academic careers, the D.P.A., by virtue of its focus on application of theory, has more practical application in managerial settings than the Ph.D. degree. Most D.P.A. graduates lead careers as senior-level practitioners, while others enter academia. This is similar to other professional research doctorates such as the Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) and Doctor of Education (Ed.D). A Ph.D. is more concentrated on developing theory and conducting specialized scholarly research. This degree is more appropriate for people who wish to become professional researchers, or who wish to pursue a career in academia. Most Ph.D. graduates lead careers as university researchers and professors or as senior researchers in business or government.  Purpose  The Doctor of Public Administration program is designed to provide senior-level public managers, or quasi-public managers, with the substantive skills, knowledge and values necessary in this area. Students in most programs develop a thorough knowledge of the legal, ethical and political environments of public administrators. Students understand the administrative functions of governmental agencies and gain expertise in strategic planning, advanced management techniques, program implementation and results-based leadership. The official policy of Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs, and Administration (NASPAA) is that the doctorate is a research degree, regardless of degree title. Its \\"Policy on Doctoral Education in Public Affairs/Public Administration\\" (1983,1987,1) states that: \\"Doctoral programs in public administration...should prepare students to undertake significant research in their subsequent careers, whether in government, academic life, or other settings; the capacity to do significant research, rather than access to a particular career setting, is the appropriate goal of doctoral training.\\"  Structure of programs  Most D.P.A. programs require about 90 credit hours of combined graduate coursework. Students are expected to take a number of core classes, electives, research/method classes, and dissertation credits. Some programs also require comprehensive examinations. All programs require a doctoral dissertation that contributes to knowledge. Candidates typically work with a committee and advisors throughout the process and the dissertation eventually requires an oral defense to the student's committee. Curricula may be offered on a full-time or part-time basis. The normal duration of a doctorate should correspond to 3‚Äì5 years of full-time graduate study or 7‚Äì10 years of sustained part-time graduate study. The D.P.A. is preceded by a master's degree, typically the Master of Public Administration or the Master of Public Policy. D.P.A. programs are most common in the United States and the Philippines. The D.P.A. degree may have a specialization such as management science, organizational behavior, implementation, non-profit management, public finance, national security, defense policy, education policy, environmental policy, international trade and immigration, policy making, policy evaluation, program evaluation, criminal justice, civil rights, health and welfare, federalism, strategic management, public health, administrative law, social welfare, tax policy, government-business relations, economic policy, and public management.

The impounded reservoir is called Lake Burbury. The dam was constructed in 1991 as part of the King River Power Development Scheme, by the Hydro Electric Corporation (TAS) for the purpose of generating hydro-electric power via the John Butters Power Station located below the dam wall. Features and location The Crotty Dam, together with the Darwin Dam, are two major dams that form the headwaters for the King River Hydroelectric Power Development. The dam is located in the upper reaches of the King River gorge where the river breaks through the West Coast Range. It captures the high rainfall in the catchment of the King River and allows diversion of water through a tunnel to the John Butters Power Station downstream of the dam. The Crotty Dam wall, constructed with of concrete faced rock and gravel fill core, is high and long. At 100% capacity the dam wall holds back (43,000√ó106 cu ft) of water. The surface area of Lake Burbury is and the catchment area is . The single uncontrolled and controlled spillway is capable of discharging . = Spillway = A unique feature of the dam is its spillway. The spillway is located on the embankment, rather than on one of the rock abutments. This had never been successfully attempted before in the design of dams of any significant height, due to problems in making allowance for embankment settlements. In the case of Crotty Dam, the embankment was partly composed of well graded gravels, and thus a very high modulus of embankment deformation was achieved. The high modulus limits embankment settlements. Additionally, the spillway was designed to articulate in order to accommodate any settlement that did occur. The spillway is designed to allow sufficient time for a large jet flow valve located in the diversion tunnel to be opened so that larger floods can be safely handled. The spillway designers, Sergio Giudici, also the chief engineer on the Gordon Dam, Frank Kinstler, Steven Li, Tony Morse and Graeme Maher were acknowledged within the engineering community because the spillway was the first known to \\"provide for articulation of the spillway structure so that movements in its foundations could occur without damage to the overlying structure\\". =Power station= The water from Lake Burbury is conveyed through a long unlined tunnel that runs through Mount Jukes to the John Butters Power Station, which is located on the King River downstream of the dam and King River gorge, near the confluence with the Queen River.page 10 and 11 of History The dam was constructed in the 1980s following the abandonment of the Gordon-below- Franklin power development scheme, part of the Franklin Dam. The Crotty Dam was commissioned in 1991, with the King River Power development being completed by 1992. The dam is named in honour of James Crotty who founded the North Mount Lyell Copper Mine at the turn of the 20th century. A ghost town site of the same name Crotty was submerged by the waters of Lake Burbury. In the 1910s the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company had investigated and surveyed a site very close to this dam for a proposed hydro electric scheme. Charles Whitham also wrote of the inevitability of the dam in 1927 and even proposed \\"Lake Dorothy\\" as a name for the reservoir. In 2001, Engineers Australia selected Crotty Dam as one of the 25 dams with the greatest Australian heritage value. It was awarded a Historic Engineering Marker as part of the Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.

Poor writing skills must interfere significantly with academic progress or daily activities that involves written expression (spelling, grammar, handwriting, punctuation, word usage, etc.). This disorder is also generally concurrent with disorders of reading and/or mathematics, as well as disorders related to behavior. Since it is so often associated with other learning disorders and mental problems, it is uncertain whether it can appear by itself. The prevalence of disorder of written expression is estimated to be of a similar frequency to other learning disorders, between 3 - 5%. A diagnosis can be made based on results of several assessments. Signs and symptoms *Multiple spelling mistakes *Errors in grammar and punctuation *Exceptionally poor or illegible writing *Sentences that lack cohesion *Reluctance or refusal to complete writing tasks *Anxiety or frustration (breaking pencils, tearing up homework assignments, ) Causes Specific causes of this disorder are unknown. The interaction of physical, psychological, and environmental factors is thought to contribute to the disorder of written expression. In neuropsychological and neurobiological research, some studies show evidence that abnormally high testosterone levels and abnormalities in cognitive processes (visual-motor, linguistic, attentional, and memory) are thought to play a role in learning disorder cases. The impact of brain injuries in both children and adults can impair any of these cognitive processes. =Other disabilities= * Dyslexia * Reading disability * Expressive language disorder * Mathematics disorder * Developmental coordination disorder * Traumatic brain injuryWheeler, L., Nickerson, S., Long, K., & Silver, R.

This includes remedial education tailored to improve specific skills, providing special academic services in the learning environment, and addressing concurrent health and mental issues. It is sometimes necessary to foster motivational techniques to maintain motivation and minimize negative thoughts or feelings. Using whatever modifications are necessary to overcome fears of failure in the early stages of writing mediation is strongly encouraged because children with learning disabilities often experience low self-esteem and confidence, which may further interfere with learning and academic success.

The complex was built as a hub for Albuquerque's regional transit system and as a replacement for Albuquerque's previous bus depot and train station. The center serves ABQ RIDE, Amtrak, Greyhound Lines, and the New Mexico Rail Runner Express commuter rail line. The ATC's Mission Revival-style building was designed to be reminiscent of the Alvarado Hotel, a railroad hotel which was formerly located on the site. The ATC also features a clock tower, located on the northwest corner of the complex, facing the intersection of Central Avenue and First Street. History The La Casta√±eda in Las Vegas, New Mexico, was built in 1899 as a Harvey House in the same mission revival style and sister hotel to the Alvarado. Albuquerque's first train station, a small railroad depot, opened on the site of the current ATC in the 1880s. With increasing demand for a larger facility, the Alvarado Hotel, a Mission Revival-style building which served as one of the many Harvey Houses along the train route, was constructed on the site in the 1902. Santa Fe Railroad architect Charles Whittlesey designed the building, and Mary Colter designed the interior of the hotel. The hotel was named for Hernando de Alvarado of the 1540 Francisco V√°squez de Coronado Expedition. Just south of the hotel a train station was constructed, also in the Mission Revival style and with a large, distinctive tower. The Alvarado Hotel was renowned for its luxury, but by the mid-20th century, with the decline in railroad travel in the United States, the hotel fell on hard times and was demolished in 1970. The site remained a dirt parking lot for many years. In 1993, the Albuquerque train station burned down, and Amtrak used a small facility on the site as the train station. The current ATC complex was constructed in the 2000s and was designed by Dekker/Perich/Sabatini, an Albuquerque firm of architects. The first phase of the project was completed in 2002 to serve ABQRide. The second phase, completed in 2006, added facilities for Amtrak, Greyhound Lines, and the New Mexico Rail Runner Express commuter rail line. The ATC was designed to be reminiscent of the old buildings, with many architectural elements borrowed from the Alvarado Hotel and the former train station. Albuquerque's Alvarado Hotel (Fred Harvey Hotel), Native American Building, Laundry Building, Santa Fe Train Station and Shop Area. This Campus was built in 1902 and was torn down in 1970. This drawing captures its Mission Revival Style appearance in east elevation (The raised train track platform stood in front of this view, with a garden between the platform and the buildings, and is not shown here as it would hide the lower arcade). Services =Amtrak service= Albuquerque is a stop on Amtrak's daily Southwest Chief line. One train in each direction has a layover stop in Albuquerque, where passengers can disembark while the train is cleaned, refueled, serviced, and the crew is changed. Amtrak moved its passenger service operations at Albuquerque to the Alvarado Transportation Center on January 17, 2008, sharing space with providers of intercity bus services. Amtrak's previous facility, a small building located adjacent to the current depot, was in use for passenger operations since the historic Santa Fe station burned down in 1993. The old facility is closed, and serves as the baggage claim for arriving passengers, relief area for crew, and storage. =New Mexico Rail Runner service= The New Mexico Rail Runner Express started service on July 14, 2006, between Albuquerque and Sandoval County. From 2006 to 2008, the Rail Runner expanded service to Belen and Santa Fe. This station is referred to on timetables as the Downtown Albuquerque Station. Each of the Rail Runner stations contains an icon to express each community's identity. The icon representing this station is the ATC itself. Downtown Albuquerque is where many, but not all, of the trains originate, going north to Santa Fe, or south to Belen. Rio Metro provides supplementary bus service early in the morning to passengers. =Intercity bus service= The ATC's intercity bus depot makes up most of the southern side of the complex, and contains an enclosed waiting area with ticket booths for both Greyhound and Amtrak, as well as a small cafeteria. Greyhound serves the following cities from Albuquerque: * 470 St Louis, MO * 470 Phoenix, AZ * 578 Denver, CO * 578 El Paso, TX Autobuses Americanos no longer provides direct bus service to Mexico. Passengers will need to change buses in El Paso. El Paso-Los Angeles Limousine bus service does not stop at the ATC, but rather at their own stop at I-25 Frontage Road and Menaul Blvd. =ABQ RIDE= ABQ RIDE is the local mass transit agency for metropolitan Albuquerque. The station has an indoor waiting room with a customer service desk, restrooms, and a small cafe. The building also houses the headquarters for ABQ RIDE, as well as headquarters for the transit enforcement department. Most routes in the ABQ RIDE system originate from the ATC, including: * 5 - Montgomery/Carlisle * 6 - Indian School Commuter * 7 - Candelaria Commuter * 8 - Menaul * 10 - North Fourth Street * 11 - Lomas * 12 - Constitution Commuter * 13 - Comanche Commuter * 16 - Broadway/University/Gibson * 36 - Rio Grande * 40 - D-Ride Free downtown Shuttle * 50 - Yale/Martin Luther King Jr Ave/Airport * 53 - Isleta * 54 - Bridge/Westgate * 66 - Central (Eastbound stops in front of the ATC on 1st. & Central, Westbound is across Central Ave on 1st St.) * 93 - Academy Commuter * 94 - Unser Commuter * 97 - Zuni * 217 - Downtown - Kirtland AFB limited * 250 - Free Sunport Nonstop Express * 766 - Rapid Ride Red Line (Eastbound stops in front of the ATC on 1st. & Central, Westbound is across Central Ave on 1st St.) * 777 - Rapid Ride Green Line (Eastbound stops in front of the ATC on 1st. & Central, Westbound is across Central Ave on 1st St.) The #40 D-Ride shuttle was created in 2006 as a response to the opening of the Rail Runner. It allows for commuters easy access to all of downtown Albuquerque. Other buses were also scheduled to meet with Rail Runner arrivals and departures. =Rio Metro and New Mexico Park and Ride service= New Mexico Park and Ride operates two routes at the Alvarado Transportation Center. * The Turquoise route to and from Moriarty at bay J in the northern complex, and only has one arrival and one departure during weekdays. * The Purple route departs the ATC from the 1st & Central stop in the morning on weekdays to supplement Rail Runner service, and there is no return trip to the ATC. Rio Metro operates three buses at the Alvarado Transportation Center. =Other shuttle services= The University of New Mexico and UNM Hospital provides separate commuter shuttles to the ATC for UNM and UNMH Students, staff, and faculty. These operate between the northern and southern complexes, in front of the old Amtrak building., and are free to ride. They are timed to meet certain Rail Runner arrivals and departures. Taxi and limo service, as well as personal pick-ups and drop-offs (Kiss-n-Ride) for the entire facility happen at the southern complex, in front of the entrance to the Amtrak/Greyhound waiting room. Other shuttle services operate on 1st Street between the Northern and Southern complexes in front of the old Amtrak building. =Parking= There is no dedicated parking for the ATC, except for Amtrak, Greyhound, and ABQ RIDE employees. The City of Albuquerque operates other parking areas near the ATC, including: *Paid parking garage across from the ATC on 1st Street, although cars must enter on 2nd Street. *Limited 30 minute free on-street parking on 1st Street in front of the southern complex for Greyhound and Amtrak passengers *Limited 3 hour free on-street parking on 1st Street south of the Coal Ave. overpass *Metered parking on Silver, Gold, and Central Avenues across the street from the ATC. Future changes The City of Albuquerque is working with the State of New Mexico and the Mid-Region Council of Governments, as well as other organizations to improve the area for both pedestrians and transit options. =New pedestrian access= The City of Albuquerque has applied for federal funds to change the pedestrian path at the railroad tracks by changing the underpass to a level crossing with the tracks. Currently, pedestrians must go the corner of 1st and Central before they can get to the underpass or the ATC. The underpass has been considered an undesirable area, and the plans to change it will make it easier for pedestrians and bicyclists to get to and from the ATC, as well as crossing Central Ave. =Bus rapid transit= The City of Albuquerque is in the final planning stages of Albuquerque Rapid Transit, a true BRT system intended to replace the current Rapid Ride system. The design calls for using the existing Rapid Ride stop for eastbound buses, and constructing a new median platform on Central Ave east of 1st St. for westbound buses.

However, in 2020 an unofficial freeware sequel and parody called, Blizzard! Part II: Jihadi Moon, was released by contemporary Commodore 64 game designer Mo Dernart. at Lemon64 Gameplay Gameplay screenshot The game's objective consists of aiming a machine gun turret to fire at enemies running across the screen. While these figures appear to carry weaponry, they aren't the ones representing the actual initial danger, but occasionally, bombs would appear and slowly approach the bottom of the screen, and unless fired at, explode and thus end the game. If an enemy passes the edge of the screen it appears on the side of the turret - if three of them lines up, you're dead. While the game was far from state-of-the-art both graphic and sound-wise, it approached notoriety with its \\"bonus level\\": After every level successfully completed, the game would display a line of POWs stood against a wall. The player can then execute them freely by simply holding the fire button and moving the aim over the prisoners. The game doesn't continue until all enemies have been shot. The final touch in the game is the entry of initials for the high score. The letters appear on the shirts of three figures on their way to a guillotine. Upon entering the letters, the figures go through decapitation one-by-one. The game underlines its intention to be obnoxious by labeling itself \\"The sadism game of the year\\" on the title screen, while the scrolling mission statement at the bottom says \\"The only thing you have to do, is to shoot humans...\\". The game itself also displays some sarcastic remarks (in bad English) at the end of each level, such as \\"That's funn!\\" (sic), \\"What a nice bonus\\" (upon finishing the \\"execution\\") or \\"That were Ghadaffi's children\\".

Since it is highly toxic, the fruit is not edible; instead, the dried and powdered leaves are burned as incense in Japan. Its branches and evergreen leaves are considered highly sacred by Japanese Buddhists due to their ability to remain fresh after pruning. Illicium anisatum is native to Japan. It is similar to the Chinese star anise, but its fruit is smaller and with a weaker odour, reputed to be similar to cardamom than anise. Due to its poisonous nature, its seeds have been used as a fish poison as well as a natural agricultural pesticide to repel animals from digging the grounds of Japanese graveyards. Its seeds have also been used medicinally to treat toothache and dermatitis topically, since it is unsuitable for internal use.  Toxicity and accidental use in food products  Japanese star anise contains anisatin, shikimin, and sikimitoxin, which cause severe inflammation of the kidneys, urinary tract, and digestive organs. Other compounds present in toxic species of Illicium are safrole and eugenol, which are not present in the edible Chinese star anise and are used to identify its toxicity. Shikimic acid, a substance also present in Japanese star anise, is so-called after the plant's Japanese name. In Europe, Chinese star anise tea is often used as a stress-relief tea. Cases of illness have been reported in France, Spain, and Switzerland after people were reported consuming contaminated Chinese star anise tea with Japanese star anise. This contamination hospitalized many people with epilepsy, hallucinations, and nausea all as a result of the toxin anisatin, found in the Japanese star anise. In 2001, there was a large outbreak of toxicity in the Netherlands due to accidental contamination of a tea blend containing more than 6 different tea plants with the Japanese star anise. Due to its morphological similarities, it is impossible to distinguish Chinese and Japanese star anise in its dried or processed form by its appearance only, and can only be unequivocally determined by using botanical microscopy.

She was a member of the British pop group Bucks Fizz from 1981 to 1985. She was the youngest member of the group's original line- up, aged 19 when they won the 1981 Eurovision Song Contest. During Aston's membership the group had 12 of their 13 UK top 40 hit singles, including three number one hits. Since 2009, she has performed alongside fellow original Bucks Fizz members Cheryl Baker and Mike Nolan. The group used to perform under the name The Original Bucks Fizz but are now known as The Fizz. Career =Background= Aston was born in Purley, Surrey, and came from a theatrical family. Her father was a comedian; her mother had been a dancer before becoming her husband's straight man. They also performed as acrobats. Her brother Lance performed at the 1980 Eurovision Song Contest with the band Prima Donna. Aston herself trained as a dancer, singer and actress at the Italia Conti School of Speech and Drama and performed on stage many times in her teens, mainly as a dancer. She was named \\"Miss Purley\\" in 1978 and competed in the subsequent Miss England contest, in which she was unplaced. The interval act at the televised Miss England 1978 competition was the group Co-Co, who had just been selected to represent Britain in the Eurovision Song Contest 1978 and featured Cheryl Baker in the line-up.Fawcett, Sally-Ann. Mis-3-Meanours ‚Äì Second Runner Up. Lulu.com 2 October 2017. . Page 171 =Bucks Fizz= Aston was, along with Baker, one of the four members of Bucks Fizz when they were formed in 1981 to compete in that year's Eurovision Song Contest. They won with \\"Making Your Mind Up\\"; the song went to number one in many countries, including the United Kingdom. The group went on to become one of the top-selling groups of the 1980s, scoring many hit singles and albums over the next few years, including two more British number ones: \\"The Land of Make Believe\\" and \\"My Camera Never Lies\\". Aston designed many of the group's stage outfits. In 1983 she performed the lead vocal on the song \\"When We Were Young\\", which went on to become one of the group's biggest hits. Aston became known for her love of physical exercise, and released a keep-fit album in early 1984 called Shape Up and Dance. She was the victim of an attack while out jogging, but fought off the attacker and recovered from the incident. In December 1984, while on tour, Bucks Fizz were involved in a tour coach crash, in which Nolan was seriously injured. By this time, tensions within the group had risen to the point that Aston was eager to leave, but was still under contract. However, the following year, she left the group in acrimonious circumstances. Aston became the subject of many newspaper headlines on her sudden departure where it emerged that she had had an affair with the group's producer, Andy Hill, who was also the husband of Bucks Fizz creator Nichola Martin. The group's management company took Aston to court under the terms of her contract, but later agreed to release her. However, an injunction was placed on her against commencing a solo career, which took two years to settle and resulted in her selling her Kensington home. In addition, all eight cases were settled out of court after the case was investigated by the attorney general. =After Bucks Fizz= Forced to sell her house, Aston was living in a small bedsit in Croydon on housing benefits in the early 1990s. Her brother had married Shakespear's Sister star Marcella Detroit who encouraged her to record new songs. In 1993 Aston released a single, \\"Naked Phoenix\\", and recorded an album of songs. This same year she contributed a song to the controversial Michael Winner film Dirty Weekend, although Aston walked out of the film's premiere in disgust. By 1995 she was living with her parents but was still writing and recording music. Around this time she met and began dating guitarist Dave Colquhoun, whom she married in 1999. During the latter part of the 1990s and early 2000s, Aston toured with her band Aston, performing rock and pop tracks, many of which she wrote herself. In 2002 she was involved in a cover band called Monster Boogie, and she also appeared in an episode of Never Mind the Buzzcocks as one of the mystery guests in the identity parade round. The following year she released an album, Alive and Well, featuring 13 tracks, all of which she co-wrote with her husband. The glory years of Bucks Fizz, mainly focusing on Aston, were portrayed in 2005 in a drag lip-synch show, Night of a Thousand Jay Astons, at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe after its d√©but in London. Aston was played by one female and three male performers. The life of Aston was told through an outrageous parody, and was described in review as \\"hilariously over the top\\". The show has also been staged at other venues, including the Comedy Theatre in Dublin in May 2006 and the Soho Theatre in London in summer 2007. Another solo album, a three-disc box-set Lamb or Lizard, was released in July 2006 through her website, which featured recordings from before and after her work with Bucks Fizz. In 2001 she set up a performing arts school in her name, The Jay Aston Theatre Arts School, teaching children aged between two and 17. The school still runs today. In March 2007, she appeared in the Comic Relief video \\"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\\" a comic cover version of The Proclaimers song, dancing with the other three original members of Bucks Fizz, and also Shelley Preston, who had replaced Aston in the group in 1985. This was the first time that Aston had met the group since 1985. She said that relations between them had improved, but not the extent that could work together as a group again: \\"I'm kind of on good terms with all of them individually. But as a band, it just doesn't work, and it's a shame, but it doesn't. There's always been two camps ‚Äì Cheryl's camp and Bobby's camp, and I was the one in Bobby's camp, and Mike was always in Cheryl's camp.\\" A new Bucks Fizz CD with a bonus DVD, The Very Best of Bucks Fizz, was released in May 2007. Aston appeared alone on the National Lottery to promote the album. In August 2008, Aston once again joined up with Bucks Fizz members Mike Nolan, Cheryl Baker and Shelley Preston, when she appeared on a television show celebrating 1980s acts ‚Äì with one episode devoted to the reuniting of Bucks Fizz. This programme was shown on Living TV in March 2009. In May 2013, Aston appeared on the second series of UK singing talent show The Voice, singing Muse's \\"\\"Time is Running Out\\"\\", but was not chosen by any of the judges. Aside from her duties in The Fizz, Aston has also appeared in pantomime a number of times. In 2019 She appeared as the Wicked Step Mother in Snow White at the Queens Theatre Barnstaple. =The Fizz= In 2004, Bucks Fizz members Cheryl Baker, Mike Nolan and Shelley Preston reunited to form The Original Bucks Fizz and performed in concert throughout the UK. In April 2009, Preston announced that she was leaving the group and Aston agreed to join ‚Äì the first time she had been a part of Bucks Fizz since 1985. Since then, they have toured the UK extensively and have released three albums to date, one of them, The F‚ÄìZ of Pop, becoming a top 30 hit in the UK Charts. They currently perform under the name The Fizz. =Acting= Before Bucks Fizz, Aston had ambitions to become an actress, but her career in this field encompassed only minor roles in To the Manor Born and Citizen Smith. In 2008, Aston was cast as Claudia Brite in the film The Last Days of Edgar Harding which was shot in August 2008 and screened in 2010. The film has never seen a mainstream release. Personal life Aston married guitarist Dave Colquhoun in August 1999 in Greenwich, London. They have a daughter, Josie Alexandra (born 2003, Bromley, Greater London). In 2011 they lived in Tatsfield, Surrey. Aston's mother Hilda died in 2007, while her father Ted died in 2009. Aston continues to teach dance and performance at her performing arts school in Kent. She was diagnosed with mouth cancer in June 2018. Since then, she has had surgery, and the outlook is said to be \\"positive\\". Politics On 27 August 2019, the Brexit Party announced that Aston would be standing as its candidate in the London constituency of Kensington, at the time held by the Labour Party. She came fifth after receiving 384 votes (0.9%).

It began after the successful revolt led by Masaniello and Giulio Genoino against King Philip III and his viceroys. The leader of the Republic was Henry II of Lorraine, duke of Guise, descendant of the former king of Naples Rene I of Anjou. The Republic had the following official names: Serenissima Repubblica di questo regno di Napoli (\\"Most Serene Republic of this Kingdom of Naples\\"), Reale Repubblica (\\"Royal Republic\\"), and Serenissima Monarchia repubblicana di Napoli (\\"Most Serene Republican Monarchy of Naples\\"). All indicated the double nature of the Republic, both republican and monarchical, and \\"Serenissima\\" was a purposeful comparison with the famous Italian maritime republic with the same title, Venice. The coat of arms was a red shield with the motto S.P.Q.N. (i.e., Senatus Populusque Neapolitanus), in imitation of the well-known S.P.Q.R., the initialism of the Latin phrase, Senatus Populusque Romanus (\\"The Senate and the People of Rome\\"), Thus, the Neapolitan phrase meant \\"The Senate and People of Naples.\\" The coat of arms contained the crest of the duke of Guise. History Naples surrenders to John of Austria. Painting by Carlo Coppola. Museo di San Martino. The Kingdom of Naples had been in personal union with the crown of Spain since 1504. In the first half of the 17th century Naples was in the midst of a harsh economic crisis, one which was affecting all of Europe. In Naples it was worsened by a viceregal government with few local concerns, interested only in helping to finance the series of continent wide wars in which Spain had become entangled. Though repressed by the forces of viceroy Don Rodrigo Ponce de Le√≥n, which had been able to restore order in almost all of the city, Masaniello's revolt had left in the streets a strong discontent. When a fleet led by John of Austria the Younger, King Philip's son, came \\"to soothe the last insurgents\\" by cannonading the city, a new revolt broke out. This time the revolt was not one of lazzari (poor Neapolitan people) simply rebelling against the class that held power; it was led by the gunsmith Gennaro Annese and was clearly against Philip. The viceroy's army was expelled and a Republic declared. Neapolitans sought French support and called Henry of Guise to be entrusted with the leadership of the new state. The duke of Guise was in Rome at that moment and accepted the offer, being eager to have a crown and to reinstate French influence in southern Italy after two centuries. On November 15, 1647, he landed in Naples and took the reins of the Republic. The Neapolitan Republic had, in fact, no hopes from the very beginning. The viceroy's forces controlled the line of castles around the city and the nobility controlled the provinces from their base in Aversa, thus controlling supply lines into Naples. In 1648 the duke of Guise managed to take Aversa, but the situation did not change much. The king's army, again under the command of John of Austria, chose a prudent strategy and filled Naples with spies, agitators and other agents to win over the remaining nobles. On April 5, 1648, Henry, deceitfully pressed by some of his counsellors who were in Philip's pay, tried a sally, and Naples was reconquered by its former masters without resistance. On June 4 a French fleet of 40 ships tried to reconquer the city, but this time the people, tired by more than a year of continuing \\"revolution\\", did not rise. The French attempted to land on the neighbouring island of Procida, but they were beaten by Spanish forces and had to flee. Another and even more powerful French fleet appeared in the Gulf of Naples on August 4 of the same year, led by Thomas of Savoy. This time they managed to conquer Procida but, after being repulsed by Spanish naval forces near Ischia, Pozzuoli and Salerno, they abandoned any hope of taking Naples. Soon after, Gennaro Annese was beheaded in Piazza del Mercato in Naples. The following year, on June 3, there were new riots in Naples, but they were soon suppressed, as the people had simply grown weary of fighting.

It now hangs in the Galleria Borghese in Rome. According to Caravaggio's first biographer, Giovanni Baglione, it was a cabinet piece painted by the artist using a mirror. History The painting dates from Caravaggio's first years in Rome following his arrival from his native Milan in mid-1592. Sources for this period are inconclusive and probably inaccurate, but they agree that at one point the artist fell extremely ill and spent six months in the hospital of Santa Maria della Consolazione. According to a 2009 article in the American medical publication Clinical Infectious Diseases, the painting indicates that Caravaggio's physical ailment likely involved malaria, as the jaundiced appearance of the skin and the icterus in the eyes are indications of some active hepatic disease causing high levels of bilirubin. According to Paolo Zamboni professor of Vascular Surgery at University of Ferrara, the obvious signs of anemia, brown skin, and acanthosis nigricans lead back to the diagnosis in painting of Addison's disease, a condition described by Addison in the 1800s that affects the adrenal glands.Corriere della Sera Corriere Salute, pp. 10 e 11 Gioved√¨ 18 Giugno 2020 The Sick Bacchus was among the many works making up the collection of Giuseppe Cesari, one of Caravaggio's early employers, which was seized by the art-collector Cardinal-Nephew Scipione Borghese in 1607, together with the Boy Peeling Fruit and Boy with a Basket of Fruit. Style Apart from its assumed autobiographical content, this early painting was likely used by Caravaggio to market himself, demonstrating his virtuosity in painting genres such as still-life and portraits and hinting at the ability to paint the classical figures of antiquity. The three-quarters angle of the face was among those preferred for late renaissance portraiture, but what is striking is the grimace and tilt of the head, and the very real sense of the suffering; a feature that most Baroque art shares. The still-life can be compared with that contained in slightly later works such as the Boy With a Basket of Fruit and the Boy Bitten by a Lizard where the fruits are in a much better condition, reflecting no doubt Caravaggio's improved condition, both physically and mentally. The painting shows the influence of his teacher, the Bergamasque Simone Peterzano, in the utilization of the tensed musculature depiction, and of the austere Lombard school style in its attention to realistic details. Commentary Cindy Sherman, as part of her History Portrait series (1989‚Äì90), produced a parody on Sick Bacchus, an ironic photographic self-portrait named Untitled # 224.Kimberlee A. Cloutier- Blazzard, Cindy Sherman: Her ‚ÄúHistory Portrait‚Äù Series as Post-Modern Parody, Bread and Circus, 29 July 2007 During a 2018 NPR interview, Paul Janeway of the band St. Paul & the Broken Bones said that the title of his band's new album, Young Sick Camellia, is an homage to Caravaggio's Young Sick Bacchus (camellias being the state flower of the band's home state, Alabama).

The imprint was the result of a deal between Marvel and Paramount Pictures to produce licensed comic book series based upon the entertainment company's franchises Mission: Impossible (in particular the soon-to-be-launched film series) and Star Trek. The agreement resulted in DC Comics and Malibu Comics abruptly losing the rights to publish their own Star Trek comics series. The first comic published under the Paramount Comics banner was a prequel to the first Mission: Impossible film (and the first M:I comic since Dell Comics ended their series in the early 1970s). This was followed soon after by a one-shot crossover between Star Trek and Marvel's superhero team, the X-Men. After that, Marvel launched a series of comics based upon all four Trek series produced to that time, including Star Trek: Voyager, a title Malibu had been scheduled to produce but was unable due to the change of license. Marvel also launched an original series, Star Trek: Starfleet Academy, as well as Star Trek: Early Voyages which featured the adventures of Captain Christopher Pike and his crew. The agreement between Paramount and Marvel hit some major snags after about a year, resulting in Paramount withdrawing support for non-series based characters and storylines. As a result, both Early Voyages and Starfleet Academy were abruptly cancelled in the midst of their respective story arcs. Marvel phased out the Paramount Comics banner and their remaining Star Trek titles lasted for about another year before ending in 1998. The Star Trek license was subsequently picked up by DC's WildStorm Productions imprint. The Paramount Comics logo continued to be used in Wildstorm's Star Trek comics, although it was only featured on the interior title page, not on the cover as it was with Marvel. Besides Trek, Mission: Impossible and a one-shot starring Snake Plissken, Paramount Comics published The Mighty Heroes, a one-shot based on the animated series. An ongoing Mission: Impossible series had been announced, but only the one-shot was ever published. Years after the demise of Paramount Comics, Marvel again made a deal with the studio - this time, Paramount would be the distributor for a number of feature films produced by Marvel's film production unit, Marvel Studios. The first film in this deal was Iron Man.

He would rejoin and leave the band several times over the years, with Geezer Butler Band being his first attempt at a recording project outside of Sabbath. Along with Butler, the band consisted of guitarist Pedro Howse, who would later also play in GZR with Butler. Welsh vocalist Carl Sentance (ex-Persian Risk) fronted the band. The band released no recordings, but performed some shows in the mid-1980s of which some bootleg recordings still exist.

Biography San Marcello al Corso, by Carlo Fontana, 1682‚Äì83. There seems to be no proof that he belonged to the family of famous architects of the same name, which included Domenico Fontana. Born in Brusato, near Como (now part of the town of Novazzano in Canton Ticino, Switzerland), Fontana went to Rome before 1655. He became a draughtsman for the architectural plans of Pietro da Cortona, Carlo Rainaldi, and Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Bernini employed him for nearly a decade in diverse projects. His first independent project may be the church of San Biagio in Campitelli, completed by 1665. His fa√ßade at San Marcello al Corso (1682‚Äì83) is described as one of his most successful works. For his patron, Innocent XII, he erected the immense building of the Istituto Apostolico San Michele at Ripa Grande, organized around its church; the baptismal chapel at St. Peter's; and slightly modified and finished Palazzo Montecitorio, which had been begun as Bernini's Palazzo Ludovisi, for Niccol√≤ Ludovisi during the reign of the Ludovisi pope Gregory XV, and which he publicized by a Discorso (1694). At the request of Clement XI he built the public oil deposits (Olearie Papali) within the ruins of the Baths of Diocletian (currently used for temporary exhibitions), the portico of Santa Maria in Trastevere, and the basin of the fountain of San Pietro in Montorio. He designed the Casanate library at Santa Maria sopra Minerva, designed the ribbed hemispherical dome for the duomo of Montefiascone (completed long after his death) and the casino in the Vatican, and collected all the models of the building. Fontana mainly worked in Rome, assisted by his nephews Girolamo and Francesco Fontana (1668‚Äì1708), but he sent a model for the cathedral of Fulda, and others to Vienna for the royal stables. Among his other foreign works were the designs for a Jesuit complex in Azpeitia, Spain, in the village of Loyola where Saint Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Jesuit Order was born. This grandiose basilica was a major influence upon baroque architecture of the New World. Fontana was an able artist and a good designer, but lacked the innovation that characterized early Baroque architects like Cortona and Borromini. In addition, he was more successful as an architect than as a writer. By order of Innocent XI he wrote a diffuse historical description of the Templum Vaticanum (1694), which included his project for completing St. Peter's. In this work Fontana advised the demolition of that dense nest of medieval houses called La Spina which formed a sort of island from Ponte Sant' Angelo to the piazza of St. Peter's; the project was completed under Mussolini, creating the Via della Conciliazione. Fontana made a calculation of the whole expense of St. Peter's from the beginning to 1694, which amounted to 46,800,052 crowns, without including models. He also published works on the Colosseum; the Aqueducts; the inundation of the Tiber, etc. Furthermore, twenty seven manuscript volumes of his writings and sketches are preserved in the Royal Library at Windsor. Fontana was principe of the Accademia di San Luca in 1686 and 1692‚Äì1700. Fontana's studio was one of the most prolific in Europe; its designs for fountains, tombs, and altars were often imitated or reproduced abroad. Among Fontana's disciples, who spread his fame throughout Europe, were Giovanni Battista Vaccarini in Sicily, Filippo Juvarra in Italy and Spain, James Gibbs in England, Matthaus Daniel Poppelmann in Germany, Johann Lucas von Hildebrandt and Fischer von Erlach in Austria, Nicodemus Tessin the Younger in Sweden, and Nicola Michetti in Italy and Russia.

In the diagram, lines carry 0\\\\rangle. See the section named \\"The protocol\\" below for more details regarding this picture. In quantum information theory, superdense coding (or dense coding) is a quantum communication protocol to transmit two classical bits of information (i.e., either 00, 01, 10 or 11) from a sender (often called Alice) to a receiver (often called Bob), by sending only one qubit from Alice to Bob, under the assumption of Alice and Bob pre-sharing an entangled state. This protocol was first proposed by Bennett and Wiesner in 1992 and experimentally actualized in 1996 by Mattle, Weinfurter, Kwiat and Zeilinger using entangled photon pairs. By performing one of four quantum gate operations on the (entangled) qubit she possesses, Alice can prearrange the measurement Bob makes. After receiving Alice's qubit, operating on the pair and measuring both, Bob has two classical bits of information. If Alice and Bob do not already share entanglement before the protocol begins, then it is impossible to send two classical bits using 1 qubit, as this would violate Holevo's theorem. Superdense coding is the underlying principle of secure quantum secret coding. The necessity of having both qubits to decode the information being sent eliminates the risk of eavesdroppers intercepting messages.Wang, C., Deng, F.-G., Li, Y.-S., Liu, X.-S., & Long, G. L. (2005). Quantum secure direct communication with high- dimension quantum superdense coding. Physical Review A, 71(4). It can be thought of as the opposite of quantum teleportation, in which one transfers one qubit from Alice to Bob by communicating two classical bits, as long as Alice and Bob have a pre-shared Bell pair.  Overview  Suppose Alice wants to send two classical bits of information (00, 01, 10, or 11) to Bob using qubits (instead of classical bits). To do this, an entangled state (e.g. a Bell state) is prepared using a Bell circuit or gate by Charlie, a third person. Charlie then sends one of these qubits (in the Bell state) to Alice and the other to Bob. Once Alice obtains her qubit in the entangled state, she applies a certain quantum gate to her qubit depending on which two-bit message (00, 01, 10 or 11) she wants to send to Bob. Her entangled qubit is then sent to Bob who, after applying the appropriate quantum gate and making a measurement, can retrieve the classical two-bit message. Observe that Alice does not need to communicate to Bob which gate to apply in order to obtain the correct classical bits from his projective measurement.  The protocol  The protocol can be split into five different steps: preparation, sharing, encoding, sending, and decoding. = Preparation = The protocol starts with the preparation of an entangled state, which is later shared between Alice and Bob. Suppose the following Bell state :\\\\Phi ^{+}\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} (0\\\\rangle_A \\\\otimes 0\\\\rangle_B + 1\\\\rangle_A \\\\otimes 1\\\\rangle_B) where \\\\otimes denotes the tensor product, is prepared. Note: we can omit the tensor product symbol \\\\otimes and write the Bell state as :\\\\Phi ^{+}\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(0_A0_B\\\\rangle + 1_A1_B\\\\rangle). = Sharing = After the preparation of the Bell state \\\\Phi ^{+}\\\\rangle, the qubit denoted by subscript A is sent to Alice and the qubit denoted by subscript B is sent to Bob (note: this is the reason these states have subscripts). At this point, Alice and Bob may be in completely different locations (which might be very distant from each other). There may be a long period of time between the preparation and sharing of the entangled state \\\\Phi ^{+}\\\\rangle and the rest of the steps in the procedure. = Encoding = By applying a quantum gate to her qubit locally, Alice can transform the entangled state \\\\Phi ^{+}\\\\rangle into any of the four Bell states (including, of course, \\\\Phi ^{+}\\\\rangle). Note that this process cannot \\"break\\" the entanglement between the two qubits. Let's now describe which operations Alice needs to perform on her entangled qubit, depending on which classical two-bit message she wants to send to Bob. We'll later see why these specific operations are performed. There are four cases, which correspond to the four possible two-bit strings that Alice may want to send. 1\\\\. If Alice wants to send the classical two-bit string 00 to Bob, then she applies the identity quantum gate, \\\\mathbb{I} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1\\\\end{bmatrix}, to her qubit, so that it remains unchanged. The resultant entangled state is then : \\\\Phi ^{+}\\\\rangle := B_{00}\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(0_A0_B\\\\rangle + 1_A1_B\\\\rangle) In other words, the entangled state shared between Alice and Bob has not changed, i.e. it is still \\\\Phi ^{+}\\\\rangle. The notation B_{00}\\\\rangle is also used to remind us of the fact that Alice wants to send the two-bit string 00. 2\\\\. If Alice wants to send the classical two-bit string 01 to Bob, then she applies the quantum NOT (or bit-flip) gate, X = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} , to her qubit, so that the resultant entangled quantum state becomes : \\\\Psi ^{+}\\\\rangle := B_{01}\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(0_A1_B\\\\rangle + 1_A0_B\\\\rangle) 3\\\\. If Alice wants to send the classical two-bit string 10 to Bob, then she applies the quantum phase-flip gate Z = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -1 \\\\end{bmatrix} to her qubit, so the resultant entangled state becomes :\\\\Phi ^{-}\\\\rangle := B_{10}\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(0_A0_B\\\\rangle - 1_A1_B\\\\rangle) 4\\\\. If, instead, Alice wants to send the classical two-bit string 11 to Bob, then she applies the quantum gate Z*X to her qubit, so that the resultant entangled state becomes :\\\\Psi ^{-}\\\\rangle := B_{11}\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(0_A1_B\\\\rangle -1_A0_B\\\\rangle ) The matrices X and Z are two of the Pauli matrices. The quantum states \\\\Phi ^{+}\\\\rangle, \\\\Psi ^{+}\\\\rangle, \\\\Phi ^{-}\\\\rangle and \\\\Psi ^{-}\\\\rangle (or, respectively, B_{00}, B_{01}, B_{10} and B_{11}) are the Bell states. = Sending = After having performed one of the operations described above, Alice can send her entangled qubit to Bob using a quantum network through some conventional physical medium. = Decoding = In order for Bob to find out which classical bits Alice sent he will perform the CNOT unitary operation, with A as control qubit and B as target qubit. Then, he will perform H\\\\otimes I unitary operation on the entangled qubit A. In other words, the Hadamard quantum gate H is only applied to A (see the figure above). * If the resultant entangled state was B_{00} then after the application of the above unitary operations the entangled state will become 00\\\\rangle * If the resultant entangled state was B_{01} then after the application of the above unitary operations the entangled state will become 01\\\\rangle * If the resultant entangled state was B_{10} then after the application of the above unitary operations the entangled state will become 10\\\\rangle * If the resultant entangled state was B_{11} then after the application of the above unitary operations the entangled state will become 11\\\\rangle These operations performed by Bob can be seen as a measurement which projects the entangled state onto one of the four two-qubit basis vectors 00 \\\\rangle, 01 \\\\rangle, 10 \\\\rangle or 11 \\\\rangle (as you can see from the outcomes and the example below).  Example  For example, if the resultant entangled state (after the operations performed by Alice) was \\\\Psi ^{+}\\\\rangle := B_{01} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(0_A1_B\\\\rangle + 1_A0_B\\\\rangle), then a CNOT with A as control bit and B as target bit will change B_{01} to become B_{01}' = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(0_A1_B\\\\rangle + 1_A1_B\\\\rangle). Now, the Hadamard gate is applied only to A, to obtain B_{01} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\left({\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(0 \\\\rangle + 1 \\\\rangle) \\\\right) }_A \\\\otimes 1_B\\\\rangle + {\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(0 \\\\rangle - 1 \\\\rangle) \\\\right) }_A \\\\otimes 1_B\\\\rangle\\\\right) For simplicity, let's get rid of the subscripts, so we have B_{01} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(0 \\\\rangle + 1 \\\\rangle) \\\\otimes 1\\\\rangle + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(0 \\\\rangle - 1 \\\\rangle) \\\\otimes 1\\\\rangle \\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(01 \\\\rangle + 11 \\\\rangle) + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(01 \\\\rangle - 11 \\\\rangle) \\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{2}01 \\\\rangle + \\\\frac{1}{2} 11 \\\\rangle + \\\\frac{1}{2}01 \\\\rangle - \\\\frac{1}{2}11 \\\\rangle = 01 \\\\rangle Now, Bob has the basis state 01\\\\rangle, so he knows that Alice wanted to send the two-bit string 01.  Security  Superdense coding is a form of secure quantum communication. If an eavesdropper, commonly called Eve, intercepts Alice's qubit en route to Bob, all that is obtained by Eve is part of an entangled state. Without access to Bob's qubit, Eve is unable to get any information from Alice's qubit. A third party is unable to eavesdrop on information being communicated through superdense coding and an attempt to measure either qubit would collapse the state of that qubit and alert Bob and Alice.  General dense coding scheme  General dense coding schemes can be formulated in the language used to describe quantum channels. Alice and Bob share a maximally entangled state œâ. Let the subsystems initially possessed by Alice and Bob be labeled 1 and 2, respectively. To transmit the message x, Alice applies an appropriate channel :\\\\; \\\\Phi_x on subsystem 1. On the combined system, this is effected by :\\\\omega \\\\rightarrow (\\\\Phi_x \\\\otimes I)(\\\\omega) where I denotes the identity map on subsystem 2. Alice then sends her subsystem to Bob, who performs a measurement on the combined system to recover the message. Let the effects of Bob's measurement be Fy. The probability that Bob's measuring apparatus registers the message y is :\\\\operatorname{Tr}\\\\; (\\\\Phi_x \\\\otimes I)(\\\\omega) \\\\cdot F_y . Therefore, to achieve the desired transmission, we require that :\\\\operatorname{Tr}\\\\; (\\\\Phi_x \\\\otimes I)(\\\\omega) \\\\cdot F_y = \\\\delta_{xy} where Œ¥xy is the Kronecker delta.  Experimental  The protocol of superdense coding has been actualized in several experiments using different systems to varying levels of channel capacity and fidelities. In 2004, trapped beryllium 9 ions were used in a maximally entangled state to achieve a channel capacity of 1.16 with a fidelity of 0.85.Schaetz, T., Barrett, M. D., Leibfried, D., Chiaverini, J., Britton, J., Itano, W. M., ‚Ä¶ Wineland, D. J. (2004). Quantum Dense Coding with Atomic Qubits. Physical Review Letters, 93(4). In 2017, a channel capacity of 1.665 was achieved with a fidelity of 0.87 through optical fibers.Williams, B. P., Sadlier, R. J., & Humble, T. S. (2017). Superdense Coding over Optical Fiber Links with Complete Bell-State Measurements. Physical Review Letters, 118(5). High dimensional ququarts (states formed in photon pairs by non- degenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion) were used to reach a channel capacity of 2.09 (with a limit of 2.32) with a fidelity of 0.98.Hu, X.-M., Guo, Y., Liu, B.-H., Huang, Y.-F., Li, C.-F., & Guo, G.-C.

Morrison wrote with the signature Zadkiel Tao-Sze. Morrison wrote such articles as The New Principia, or true system of astronomy, in which the Earth is proved to be the stationary centre of the Solar System (1868) which made him a charlatan in the eyes of scientists.

In 1774 he emigrated to Philadelphia; it is thought that he may have been persuaded to do so by Benjamin Franklin. In Philadelphia he again went into business as a printer, but received little work; he printed the Lettre adress√©e aux habitants de la province de Qu√©bec, ci-devant le Canada (Letter to the Inhabitants of Canada) for the Continental Congress in 1775, and travelled to Montreal the following year to set up a printing press in the newly captured city. As the Americans withdrew from Montreal, he was arrested and imprisoned, but released later in the year; however, he managed to publish several works in 1776. In 1778 he founded the Gazette Litt√©raire de Montr√©al, edited by Valentin Jautard.Doyon, Nova, \\"L'Acad√©mie de Montr√©al (1778): fiction litt√©raire ou projet utopique ? \\", in Mens, vol 1, no 2, Spring 2001, pp. 115-140. Both were arrested in 1779 for sedition, and imprisoned for three years; on his release, Mesplet was $5,000 in debt but quickly dealt with his creditors,.

The stories are set in the South of England, mostly in Hampshire, in a post-apocalyptic future where, due to a worldwide ecological catastrophe, life has reverted to a militaristic, medieval setting of walled cities and perpetual warfare. Christians are a despised minority, as spiritual matters are in the hands of a priestly class of monastic \\"Seers\\" who interpret the will of the \\"Spirits\\". There are signs of the past existence of the modern world in the ruins of great cities and \\"high roads\\" which dot the harsh landscape, but the Seers have made the technology of the \\"ancients\\" anathema, and anyone dabbling in \\"Science\\" is immediately put to death. The catastrophe has also resulted in a greatly increased number of birth defects. People with dwarfism constitute a separate caste to \\"true\\" men and fulfill the mythical role of forging weaponry, along with other metal work. People called \\"polymufs\\", who have other disfiguring mutations, are the lowest caste, as menial workers and wage slaves, regardless of whether they are actually physically or mentally disabled. The Prince in Waiting The cover of the first volume.Thirteen- year-old Luke is the son of a Captain, one of the semi-hereditary caste of officers of the army of his home city of Winchester. Luke has had an uneventful childhood and looks forward to his fifteenth year, when he will begin training for his own military career. By a twist of fate he becomes the toast of the city when he leads his team to victory in the annual mock combat tournament. A series of machinations by religious and political leaders results in his father becoming the new Prince of Winchester, and in Luke being named as his successor and future \\"Prince of Princes\\". Luke is, on the whole, pleased with his new position and takes pleasure in the nobleman's pastimes of hunting, hawking, riding, and military drill. Luke also takes pride in his father's success in leading the city to a number of victories on the battlefield. But before Luke reaches the age of seventeen his mother is murdered, his father is treacherously killed, and his elder half-brother Peter has engineered his own succession as the new Prince. Luke, realising that his position as a dispossessed heir is precarious, escapes the city for the Sanctuary of the High Seers, where he learns their surprising secrets. Beyond the Burning Lands The cover of the second volume.Luke leaves the Seers' sacred sanctuary near Stonehenge to return to Winchester as an honoured member of his brother's royal court. Luke is satisfied for the time being to serve as his brother's second in command and confidant. However, his desire for adventure sends him on an expedition to the uncharted territory beyond the Burning Lands, an active volcanic region to the north. After a perilous journey, the expedition reaches the country of the Wilsh, a wealthy and civilised people who are ruled by the wise and generous King Cymru from his royal seat in the beautiful open city of Klan Gothlen. Luke is astonished to see that several of the prejudices of the southern lands are not in sway here: technology is openly used and discussed; Christians, though a minority, are accepted in society; and polymufs are not relegated to a lower caste: the Wilsh king has a polymuf as his chief adviser. Luke is acclaimed a hero in this new land when he kills the Bayemot, a kind of giant amoeba which comes from the sea and wreaks havoc on the land. After he recovers from the injuries suffered in the fight with the monster, Luke accepts the offer of a formal betrothal to the daughter of King Cymru. He then returns to Winchester, only to stand charged with the murder of his brother's wife and unborn child. He is sentenced to be crucified and burned alive. He challenges his brother to a sword duel to clear his name, though Peter, mistakenly assuming Luke wishes to die by the sword and escape the torturous execution, says he will merely wound Luke and Luke will still face the painful death. However, Peter is stricken with anger and grief, and despite his superior skill and strength, accidentally runs himself on Luke's sword during the ensuing fight (though Luke later wonders if Peter did it on purpose because he wished to die), and Luke finds himself the new Prince. The Sword of the Spirits The cover of the third volume. Luke, readily assuming the role of military leader, extends his rule to Petersfield and Romsey and appears to be on his way to fulfilling the Spirits' command to unify the cities of the civilised lands. Then, from beyond the Burning Lands the Wilsh princess Blodwen comes to Winchester to consummate the alliance. However, Luke is much less at ease in the boudoir than on the battlefield: Blodwen falls in love with Luke's friend and principal military advisor, Edmund. When Luke attempts to exile Edmund to save face and the alliance, an insurrection ensues. The city's military commanders are divided between those supporting Edmund and those loyal to Luke. At a peace meeting, the city's senior Captain, who had presented himself as a friendly mediator, turns on Luke and proposes that Princely rule be replaced by a council of commanding officers, in which all are equal. Deposed, a furious Luke is forced to flee beyond the Burning Lands, where Blodwen's royal father lives, and raise an army to take back what is rightfully his. King Cymru grimly aids him, considering Blodwen's betrayal an affront to his honour. While wintering at the Seers' sanctuary, Luke's loyal dwarf retainer, Hans, discovers how to make a weapon which will make Luke's army unbeatable: the Sten gun. Luke leads the Wilsh army to Winchester, but after a great slaughter and horrific siege, he fails to breach the walls of the city. The Seers, who still hope to see the warring cities of the south united under one leader, arrive with field artillery, but as he prepares for the final assault on his native city, Luke realises that he cannot bear the human costs which a victory would entail. He forswears Winchester and returns north to live as Cymru's adopted heir to the Wilsh kingdom. The trilogy ends on a hopeful note as the Seers, now called scientists, openly introduce technology to the more tolerant Wilsh people, who dedicate themselves to peacefully rebuilding modern civilisation. Themes One of the enduring consequences of the natural catastrophe which toppled the old order is global cooling, a theme also addressed by Youd in the adult novel The World in Winter. Like the heroes of Youd's other post-apocalyptic novels (including the more famous The Tripods), Luke is an example of a flawed protagonist. Luke's flaws include a copious helping of pride and stubbornness. He interacts awkwardly with women, and is highly intolerant of any dissent or other departure from absolute loyalty, and it transforms him into a near-tyrant by the climax of the series.

Conductive (metallic) mandrels are treated to create a mechanical parting layer, or are chemically passivated to limit electroform adhesion to the mandrel and thereby allow its subsequent separation. Non- conductive (glass, silicon, plastic) mandrels require the deposition of a conductive layer prior to electrodeposition. Such layers can be deposited chemically, or using vacuum deposition techniques (e.g., gold sputtering). The outer surface of the mandrel forms the inner surface of the form. The process involves passing direct current through an electrolyte containing salts of the metal being electroformed. The anode is the solid metal being electroformed, and the cathode is the mandrel, onto which the electroform gets plated (deposited). The process continues until the required electroform thickness is achieved. The mandrel is then either separated intact, melted away, or chemically dissolved. The surface of the finished part that was in intimate contact with the mandrel is replicated in fine detail with respect to the original, and is not subject to the shrinkage that would normally be experienced in a foundry cast metal object, or the tool marks of a milled part. The solution side of the part is less well defined, and that loss of definition increases with thickness of the deposit. In extreme cases, where a thickness of several millimetres is required, there is preferential build-up of material on sharp outside edges and corners. This tendency can be reduced by shielding, or a process known as periodic reverse,Journal of Applied Electrochemistry 1979 407-410 Periodic reverse current electroplating and surface finishing. M.I. Ismail where the electroforming current is reversed for short periods and the excess is preferentially dissolved electrochemically. The finished form can either be the finished part, or can be used in a subsequent process to produce a positive of the original mandrel shape, such as with vinyl records or CD and DVD stamper manufacture. In recent years, due to its ability to replicate a mandrel surface with practically no loss of fidelity, electroforming has taken on new importance in the fabrication of micro and nano-scale metallic devices and in producing precision injection molds with micro- and nano-scale features for production of non-metallic micro-molded objects. Process Electroforming process detail In the basic electroforming process, an electrolytic bath is used to deposit nickel or other electroformable metal onto a conductive surface of a model (mandrel). Once the deposited material has been built up to the desired thickness, the electroform is parted from the substrate. This process allows precise replication of the mandrel surface texture and geometry at low unit cost with high repeatability and excellent process control. If the mandrel is made of a non-conductive material it can be coated with a thin conductive layer. Advantages and disadvantages The main advantage of electroforming is that it accurately replicates the external shape of the mandrel. Generally, machining a cavity accurately is more challenging than machining a convex shape, however the opposite holds true for electroforming because the mandrel's exterior can be accurately machined and then used to electroform a precision cavity. Compared to other basic metal forming processes (casting, forging, stamping, deep drawing, machining and fabricating) electroforming is very effective when requirements call for extreme tolerances, complexity or light weight. The precision and resolution inherent in the photo- lithographically produced conductive patterned substrate, allows finer geometries to be produced to tighter tolerances while maintaining superior edge definition with a near optical finish. Electroformed metal can be extremely pure, with superior properties over wrought metal due to its refined crystal structure. Multiple layers of electroformed metals can be bonded together, or to different substrate materials to produce complex structures with \\"grown-on\\" flanges and bosses. Tolerances of 1.5 to 3 nanometres have been reported. A wide variety of shapes and sizes can be made by electroforming, the principal limitation being the need to part the product from the mandrel. Since the fabrication of a product requires only a single model or mandrel, low production quantities can be made economically.

Economic views =Classical liberalism= An anarcho-capitalist, Huerta argues that classical liberalism and their ideal is theoretically impossible; he also notes that classical liberals have failed to limit the power of the state. =General equilibrium theory= Economist Leland B. Yeager has cited Huerta de Soto as an example of scorn in economics. Yeager states that Soto scorns general equilibrium theory, citing a passage in which Soto refers to the \\"pernicious analysis\\" of price equilibrium at \\"the intersection of mysterious curves or functions lacking any real existence...even in the minds of the actors involved.\\" =Austrian business cycle and full reserve banking= Huerta de Soto advocates full- reserve banking, a system in which 100% reserve requirements for banks would prevent any expansion of credit. In 2006, Huerta de Soto wrote an 876-page book on the subject, published in English by the Mises Institute as Money, Bank Credit, and Economic Cycles. Samuel Gregg reviewed the book writing that \\"[t]he sheer length of this text will demand much time and concentration of readers wishing to fully absorb its insights. Certainly there is an element of repetition at different points. This tends, however, to reflect De Soto's determination to demonstrate that the moral, legal, and economic dimensions of money, credit, and banking cannot be artificially separated from each other without risking the loss of a sound understanding of the subject.\\" In the journal New Perspectives on Political Economy, Ludwig van den Hauwe suggested that \\"[e]ven if it may be difficult at this time to gauge in any precise manner the effect the book will have on the economics profession at large, there can be no doubt the book is destined to become a classic, both by virtue of the subject matters that are treated and in virtue of the manner in which they are treated: thoroughly and authoritatively.\\" Larry J. Sechrest's review of Huerta de Soto's book, also published by the Mises Institute, stated that the author attempted to provide \\"final and decisive proof\\" that fractional reserve banking is incompatible with private property rights, morality, and a stable economy. Sechrest wrote that although Huerta de Soto presented a painstaking investigation of legal theory, banking history, business cycles, and medieval theological doctrine, a great deal of it is irrelevant to the book's thesis. Sechrest concludes \\"Above all, Huerta de Soto refuses to even consider the possibility that banks' customers may have been quite willing to face some risk exposure in exchange for the benefits 100 percent reserve banks are unable to provide\\" and believes that \\"any departure from 100 percent reserve banking is automatically taken to be evidence of malfeasance by bankers, even when there is no clear data on the details of the contractual relations negotiated by depositors.\\"Larry J. Sechrest, Larry J. Sechrest Book ‚ÄúFree Banking: Theory, History, and a Laissez-Faire Model‚Äù, Larry J. Sechrest Preface to June 2008 edition published by Ludwig Von Mises Institute, pp. 1‚Äì3; originally published by Quorum Books, 1993. In his chapter on \\"Attempts to Legally Justify Fractional-Reserve Banking\\", Huerta de Soto considers the possibility \\"that a certain group of bank customers (or for the sake of argument, all of them) enter into a deposit contract aware and fully accepting that banks will invest (or loan, etc.) a large portion of the money they deposit\\". In this case, argues Huerta de Soto, \\"the supposed authorization from the depositors lacks legal validity\\" because few lay-persons understand the instability inherent in fractional-reserve banking: they believe their deposit is guaranteed, which Huerta de Soto considers a (near universal) misconception. As evidence of the true wishes of depositors, he cites the riots that resulted when banks suspended payments during the 1998‚Äì2002 Argentine great depression.Huerta de Soto, 2012, pp. 141-142. =Money and banking= Andre Azevedo Alves and Jose Moreira state that Huerta de Soto has written the \\"most complete and integrated analysis of the theories of banking\\" of the School of Salamanca.Andre Azevedo Alves, Jose Moreira, The Salamanca School, from series \\"Major Conservative and Libertarian Thinkers\\", Continuum International Publishing Group, 2009, p. 131, , Reception In a review for the Mises Institute's Review of Austrian Economics, Institute Associated Scholar Leland B.

Biography =Family background and education= Rous was the second son of John Rous, 1st Earl of Stradbroke, and was educated at Westminster School, and Dr. Burney's Academy. His elder brother was John Rous, 2nd Earl of Stradbroke, and his half-sister married Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Hotham. =Naval career= Rous entered the Navy on 28 January 1808 (aged just 13) as first-class volunteer on board the , under the command of Captain the Honourable Courtenay Boyle, and the flagship of Sir George Montagu, the Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth. In February 1809 he moved into the 74-gun , Captain the Hon. Arthur Kaye Legge. After taking part in the Walcheren Campaign, in November 1809 he became a midshipman aboard , flagship of Sir James Saumarez in the Baltic. In March 1811 he joined the ship , Captain John Gore, employed off Lisbon and in the Channel; and from December 1811 he served in the frigate , Captain William Hoste, taking part in the Adriatic campaign. There Rous took part in numerous actions; on the night of 31 August 1812 he took part in the cutting out from the port of Lema, near Venice, of seven vessels loaded with ship timbers for the Venetian government, together with French xebec Tisiphone and two gunboats, and on 6 January 1813 the boats of Bacchante and the sloop successfully captured five enemy gun-vessels in the neighbourhood of Otranto. On 15 May 1813 he assisted at the capture and destruction of the castle and batteries of Karlobag, and on 12 June he commanded the Bacchantes yawl in the capture of seven large gun-boats, three smaller gun-vessels, and 14 merchantmen at Giulianova. The British boats approached and boarded under a heavy fire of grape and musketry, while the Marines landed on shore, driving off 100 enemy troops and capturing two field guns. Rous was put in command of one of the merchantmen, laden with oil, which broached and capsized in heavy weather around midnight, and was only kept afloat by the buoyancy of her cargo. Rous and his prize crew were eventually rescued by another prize around 4 a.m. Into 1814 Rous participated in the capture of Rovigno, the island of Lesina, and the fortresses of Cattaro and Ragusa. On 18 May 1814 he was promoted to lieutenant and from August 1814 until December 1815 served aboard the frigate , Captain John Bastard, off Lisbon and in the Mediterranean. From January 1817 he served aboard , the flagship of Rear-Admiral Robert Plampin at Saint Helena, and on 2 August was appointed acting-commander of the 14-gun sloop . His promotion being confirmed on 26 November 1817, he was then appointed to , finally returning to England in mid-1819. He then commanded the brig-sloop at Cork from November 1821, and the sixth-rate in the Mediterranean from February 1822. Rous was promoted to post-captain on 25 April 1823, and from July 1825 commanded in the East Indies. He visited Australia, and in April 1827, organised Sydney's first regatta. In August 1828, he explored the Tweed, and he discovered, named and explored the Richmond River, both in northeastern New South Wales. The area between these rivers is known as Rous County, but counties in Australia are not widely known and are mainly used for cadastral purposes. While in Moreton Bay he named the Rous Channel, Dunwich, and Stradbroke Island, after his family titles and influenced the naming of Ipswich, Queensland. Rous returned to England in August 1829, and from November 1834 commanded the frigate . His ship ran ashore on the coast of Labrador in the Strait of Belle Isle in September 1835 and was greatly damaged. Rous, however, brought her across the Atlantic Ocean with a sprung foremast and without keel, forefoot or rudder, and though the ship was making of water an hour.Henry John Rous at Oxford Dictionary of National Biography =Thoroughbred horse racing= Illustration of Admiral Rous taken from James Rice's History of the English Turf (1879) His father owned a stud farm in Suffolk and won the 1815 2,000 Guineas with the colt Tigris. Rous, always fond of the sport became a steward of the Jockey Club in 1838, a position he held almost uninterruptedly to his death. In 1855, he was appointed public handicapper. In that role he introduced the weight-for-age scale. He managed the stables of the Duke of Bedford at Newmarket for many years, and wrote a work on On the Laws and Practice of Horse Racing that procured for him the title of the Blackstone of the Turf. The Rous Memorial Stakes was named in his honour. =Political career= In the general election of July 1841, he was elected as Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Westminster, and in February 1846 Sir Robert Peel appointed him Fourth Naval Lord, in which post he served only until July. However, this appointment triggered a by-election, which Rous lost to the Liberal candidate, De Lacy Evans, whom he had defeated in 1841. Though no longer an active serving officer Rous' seniority saw him promoted to rear admiral on 17 December 1852, to vice admiral on 5 January 1858, and to admiral on the Retired List on 6 June 1863. Admiral Rous died at No. 13 Berkeley Square in London on 19 June 1877. He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery, London.

They are synthetic pyrethroids, a synthetic form of a chemical found naturally in the chrysanthemum flower. They were first synthesized in the United States by Milton S. Schechter in 1949. Allethrin was the first pyrethroid. They are commonly used in ultra-low volume sprays for outdoor mosquito control including many household insecticides such as RAID as well as mosquito coils. Chemical structure Allethrin I and allethrin II differ by having a methyl group and a methyl ester, respectively, on one terminus. Each of these allethrins consists of the eight possible stereoisomers. A partly enantiopure variant of allethrin I, consisting of only two stereoisomers in an approximate ratio of 1:1, is called bioallethrin. The same mixture of isomers, but in an approximate ratio of 3:1, is known as esbiothrin. Toxicity The compounds have low toxicity for humans and birds. It is highly toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates. At normal application rates, allethrin is slightly toxic to bees. Insects subject to exposure become paralyzed (nervous system effect) before dying. Allethrins are toxic to cats because they either do not produce, or produce less of certain isoforms of glucuronosyltransferase, which serve in hepatic detoxifying metabolism pathways.

The company was famous for being the first airline in Alaska, and one of the first in the United States; it ceased operations on 23 November 1984 when it was operating as Wien. History Noel Wien flew an open-cockpit biplane, a Hisso Standard J1 from Anchorage, Alaska's \\"Park Strip\\" to Fairbanks, Alaska on 6 July 1924 for Alaska Aerial Transportation Company. In 1925, Wien purchased a Fokker F.III monoplane with a cabin built in 1921 in Amsterdam for the Fairbanks Airplane Company, and it was shipped to Seward, Alaska, by boat, then shipped in pieces via the Alaska Railroad to Fairbanks. Ralph Wien, Noel's brother, came with him, to work as a mechanic. They assembled the Fokker F.III Monoplane in Fairbanks. Yet, Noel and Ralph quit the company in Nov. 1925. Noel and Ralph Wien went into partnership with Gene Miller, and purchased a very used Hisso Standard from the Fairbanks Airplane Co. in 1927. In June they established their business in Nome, servicing Candle, Deering, Kotzebue, and Point Hope. At the end of the summer of 1927, Noel went into business for himself, purchasing a Stinson Detroiter he could fly year round, from Hubert Wilkins. Noel, and his Wien Alaska Airways, started a regular weekly round trip flight between Fairbanks and Nome. Noel also secured special air mail flights during the spring and fall breakup. On 20 Oct. 1928, Wien Alaska Airways, Inc. was incorporated with Noel as president, Ralph as vice-president, and Miners and Merchants Bank president Granville (Grant) R. Jackson as secretary. The new company built a hangar at Weeks Field and promptly ordered a Hamilton Metalplane. Noel taught Ralph how to fly in 1924. Ralph was killed on October 12, 1930, while flying a diesel-powered Bellanca Bush plane with Fr. Philip Dolen, Superior general of Alaskan Catholic missions, and Fr. William Walsh, a diocesan priest from Oakland, California, on board. In 1929, Noel, Ralph and Grant Jackson sold Wien Alaska Airways to Avco. Noel's company plus Anchorage Air Transport and Bennett-Rodebaugh Company were merged into a new company called Alaskan Airways Inc. Noel flew for Alaskan Airways from Feb. 1931 until Jan. 1932. In Aug. 1932, once his non-compete clause ended, Noel restarted Wien Airways of Alaska, Inc. Northern Air Transport of Nome merged with Wien in 1936. In 1936, Wien had the first air-to-ground radio links in Alaska, and by 1937, Noel had 3 other pilots flying Wien's 8 aircraft, and 3 other mechanics worked with Sigurd Wien, his brother, while 3 people administered their offices in Fairbanks and Nome. Former Wien Air Alaska hangar in Fairbanks, Alaska, in 2006 Sig received his commercial rating in 1937. Sig managed the Nome Office and flew the North Slope bush flights. Sig Wien, as a bush pilot, flew contracts for USGS geologic exploration activities including geologist Marvin Mangus. Noel Wien was forced to sell his shares to Sig in 1940, so Noel could pay for his wife's medical care. He returned as a vice- president and continued to fly for the airline into the 1950s. Noel then worked public relations for the company into the 1970s. Northern Consolidated Airlines (NCA) was formed on 8 May 1947 with Ray Petersen as president. The company was an amalgamation of Ray Petersen Flying Service, Northern Airways, Walatka Air Service, and Northern Air Service. Ray Petersen had started Ray Petersen Flying Service in 1937, based in Bethel, Alaska, supporting the platinum mining operations in Platinum, Alaska. In 1941, Ray moved his headquarters to Anchorage, and in 1943, he purchased Bristol Bay Air Service and Jim Dodson Air Service. After WWII, NCA purchased several war surplus Douglas DC3s. The front cover of the September 16, 1968 Wien system timetable stated, \\"Alaska's First Airline with America's Newest Jet the 737\\".http://www.timetableimages.com, Sept. 16, 1968 Wien Consolidated Airlines system timetable This timetable listed Boeing 737-200 jet service being operated on the following routes: Anchorage-Fairbanks, Anchorage-King Salmon, Fairbanks-Barrow and Fairbanks-Galena-Nome-Fairbanks with the latter being a \\"triangle\\" routing. On December 6 of the same year it received the first 737 certified by Boeing with the gravel kit. Also in 1968, Wien merged with Northern Consolidated Airlines (NCA). Sig was named chairman, Ray Petersen president, and Noel and Fritz board members. The new company was called Wien Consolidated Airlines until 1973, when the company name became Wien Air Alaska. Sig retired and Ray assumed the roles of chairman, president and CEO. By then the airline had more than 800 employees and five Boeing 737-200 jets as well as various turboprop and prop aircraft including Fairchild F-27s, Fairchild Hiller FH-227s, de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters, Grumman Mallards, Pilatus Porters, and Short Skyvans. Ray stepped down as president in 1976. Expansion came at a price, as Wien was pushed to the brink of bankruptcy. Household Finance, controlling owners since 1979, then dumped its investment in the airline and sold the company to Wien's President, Jim J. Flood, in 1983. He shut down the airline, and on November 23, 1984, Wien was liquidated for profit. Noel's son, Merrill, said the end of his family's airline came when it \\"was bought by a corporate raider on a leveraged buyout and was liquidated for about twice what the stock was selling for. The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 made this possible.\\" in an interview with Avweb.[2] Before Wien Air folded in 1985, they were known as the second-oldest airline in the United States. The company pioneered jet service to gravel runways , and helped develop the Boeing 737-200 Combi aircraft configuration which allowed mixed freight and passenger loads on the main deck of the aircraft. By the spring of 1984, the Wien route network extended from Point Barrow in north to dozens of Alaskan communities as well as to cities in the lower 48 states in the western U.S. including Albuquerque, (ABQ), Boise (BOI), Denver (DEN), Phoenix (PHX), Oakland (OAK), Reno (RNO) and Salt Lake City (SLC).http://www.departedflights.com, March 2, 1984 Wien Airlines system timetable & route map Their main bases were located in Anchorage and Seattle. According to the Official Airline Guide (OAG), Wien was operating interchange passenger service in conjunction with Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) with Boeing 727-100 jetliners in the fall of 1981 between Alaska and destinations in the lower 48 states.Oct. 15, 1981 Official Airline Guide (OAG) The OAG lists these no change of plane through flights to Alaska operating a routing of Miami (MIA) - New Orleans (MSY) - Houston (IAH) - Seattle (SEA) - Anchorage (ANC) and from Alaska on a routing of Anchorage - Seattle - Houston - New Orleans with Wien flight crews operating the service between Anchorage and Seattle and Pan Am flight crews operating the Houston, New Orleans and Miami service with Seattle being the interchange point (also known as a \\"transport hub\\") between the two airlines. Noel Wien's sons flew in an open cockpit biplane from Anchorage's 'Park Strip' to Fairbanks on the 75th anniversary of their father's flight. The municipality of Anchorage and the FAA allowed the plane to take off from the grass park, which was used as a runway in 1924. =Timeline= * 1924 ‚Äì 1926 Northern Air Transport * 1926 ‚Äì 1935 Wien Airways of Alaska * 1935 ‚Äì 1968 Wien Alaska Airlines * 1968 ‚Äì 1973 Wien Consolidated Airlines * 1973 ‚Äì 1982 Wien Air Alaska * 1982 ‚Äì 1984 Wien Fleet =1920s= *Standard J-1 *Fokker F.III (operated by Noel Wien at the Fairbanks Airplane Company) *Stearman C3 *Stinson SB-1 \\"Detroiter\\" (the 1926 biplane version of the Detroiter) *Hamilton Metalplane H-45 =1930s= *Bellanca CH-300 Pacemaker *Stinson SM-2 Junior *Ford Trimotor *Fokker Universal =1940s= 380px *Fairchild Pilgrim *Bellanca CH-400 *Travel Air 6000 *Noorduyn Norseman *Republic Seabee *Stinson SR-9 \\"Gull Wing\\" *Boeing 247 *Douglas DC-3 *Curtiss C-46 *Cessna 165 Airmaster =1950s= A Wien Alaska Airlines Cessna 170 met by a M29C weasel at Oliktok Point, Alaska (North Slope), Summer 1951 *Douglas DC-3 *Curtiss C-46 *Noorduyn Norseman *Cessna 170, 180, 195 *Beech 18 =1960s & 1970s: Prop and turboprop = I√±upiat people at Barrow Airport, in front of Wien Alaska Airlines Constellation N7777G, circa 1966. *Beech 18 *Cessna 185 *Curtiss C-46 *de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver *de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter - some ex-Northern Consolidated Airlines (NCA) received *Douglas DC-3 *Douglas DC-4 *Fairchild C-82 *Fairchild F-27B - Mixed passenger/freighter Combi aircraft variant with large cargo door ordered by Wien, some ex-Northern Consolidated Airlines (NCA) received * Fairchild-Hiller FH-227 *Grumman Mallard - some ex-Northern Consolidated Airlines (NCA) received *Lockheed L-749 Constellation *Pilatus Porter *Shorts Skyvan =1960s & 1970s: Jet= Wien was the launch customer for the Boeing 737-200 Combi aircraft passenger/freighter, and one of the first U.S. operators to commence operations in May 1968 with aircraft N461GB.

It was released in 1999 by Nuclear Blast Records. A deluxe edition was released in 2004 with bonus material. There is also a digipak edition of this album which contains no bonus tracks. The digipak has reflective/holographic cover art. This release featured keyboardist Mustis and the clean vocals of ICS Vortex, as well as the departure of long-time drummer Tjodalv, guitarist Astennu, and bassist Nagash. Musically this was a departure for the group. The music's overall feel is faster and darker with more emphasis on the keyboard lines versus the slower, more riff-heavy approach of previous albums. The band attributes this to Astennu's due influence, as his Carpe Tenebrum project at the time had a very similar musical direction. This album also marked a first in Dimmu's run to feature the clean vocals of ICS Vortex, adding a new dimension to the \\"Dimmu sound\\". The band continued to use the contrasting vocals in future albums. The album cover was part of the top 10 of Greatest Heavy Metal Album Covers by Blender magazine. The song Grotesquery Conceiled was played live when Dimmu Borgir won the Norwegian Grammy Award called Spellemannprisen in category metal in 1999. The band was supposed to play the song The Insight and the Catharsis with the symphony orchestra Kringkastingsorkestret, but they backed out before show because they refused to perform with Dimmu Borgir due to their satanic message. Later that night at the after party a Dimmu Borgir band member got in a fight with a member from the same orchestra. Dimmu Borgir has since been on good terms with the orchestra, having collaborated with them for the band's ninth studio album Abrahadabra and the live album Forces of the Northern Night. Track listing Reception Steve Huey of AllMusic stated that \\"Dimmu Borgir's arrangements continue to increase in complexity and sophistication on Spiritual Black Dimensions, improving on its predecessors and illustrating the band's musical progression\\". In Slayer no. 13, Jon 'Metalion' Kristiansen called Spiritual Black Dimensions \\"a fine case of melodic, over-produced, symphonic metal.

For uses in other contexts, see Types of scientific modeling. Empirical modelling refers to any kind of (computer) modelling based on empirical observations rather than on mathematically describable relationships of the system modelled. Empirical Modelling Empirical Modelling as a variety of empirical modelling Empirical modelling is a generic term for activities that create models by observation and experiment. Empirical Modelling (with the initial letters capitalised, and often abbreviated to EM) refers to a specific variety of empirical modelling in which models are constructed following particular principles. Though the extent to which these principles can be applied to model-building without computers is an interesting issue (to be revisited below), there are at least two good reasons to consider Empirical Modelling in the first instance as computer-based. Without doubt, new technologies that are based on computers have had a transformative impact where the full exploitation of Empirical Modelling principles is concerned. What is more, the conception of Empirical Modelling has been closely associated with thinking about the role of the computer in model-building. An empirical model operates on a simple semantic principle: the maker observes a close correspondence between the behaviour of the model and that of its referent. The crafting of this correspondence can be 'empirical' in a wide variety of senses: it may entail a trial-and-error process, may be based on computational approximation to analytic formulae, it may be derived as a black-box relation that affords no insight into 'why it works'. Empirical Modelling is rooted on the key principle of William James's 'radical empiricism', which postulates that all knowing is rooted in connections that are given-in-experience. Empirical Modelling aspires to craft the correspondence between the model and its referent in such a way that its derivation can be traced to connections given-in-experience. Making connections in experience is an essentially individual human activity that requires skill and is highly context-dependent. Examples of such connections include: identifying familiar objects in the stream of thought, associating natural languages words with objects to which they refer, and subliminally interpreting the rows and columns of a spreadsheet as exam results of particular students in particular subjects. Empirical Modelling principles In Empirical Modelling, the process of construction is an incremental one in which the intermediate products are artefacts that evoke aspects of the intended (and sometimes emerging) referent through live interaction and observation. The connections evoked in this way have distinctive qualities: they are of their essence personal and experiential in character and are provisional in so far as they may be undermined, refined and reinforced as the model builder's experience and understanding of the referent develops. Following a precedent established by David Gooding in his account of the role that artefacts played in Michael Faraday's experimental investigation of electromagnetism, the intermediate products of the Empirical Modelling process are described as 'construals'. Gooding's account is a powerful illustration of how making construals can support the sense-making activities that lead to conceptual insights (cf. the contribution that Faraday's work made to electromagnetic theory) and to practical products (cf. Faraday's invention of the electric motor). Figure 1 Making a construal The activities associated with making a construal in the Empirical Modelling framework are depicted in Figure 1. The eye icon at the centre the figure represents the maker's observation of the current state of development of the construal and its referent. The two arrows emanating from the eye represent the connection given-in-experience between the construal and its referent that is established in the mind of the maker. This connection is crafted through experimental interaction with the construal under construction and its emerging referent. As in genuine experiment, the scope of the interactions that can be entertained by the maker is inconceivably broad. At the maker's discretion, the interactions that characterise the construal are those that respect the connection given in the maker's experience. As the Empirical Modelling process unfolds, the construal, the referent, the maker's understanding and the context for the maker's engagement co-evolve in such a way that: * the interactive experience that the construal affords is enhanced; * the interactive experience that characterises the referent is refined; * the repertoire of characteristic interactions with the construal and its referent is enlarged; * the contextual constraints on characteristic interactions with the construal and its referent are identified. Empirical Modelling concepts In Empirical Modelling. making and maintaining the connection given-in-experience between the construal and referent is based on three primary concepts: observables, dependencies and agency. Within both the construal and its referent, the maker identifies observables as entities that can take on a range of different values, and whose current values determine its current state. All state-changing interactions with the construal and referent are conceived as changes to the values of observables. A change to the value of one observable may be directly attributable to a change in the value of another observable, in which case these values are linked by a dependency. Changes to observable values are attributed to agents, amongst which the most important is the maker of the construal. When changes to observable values are observed to occur simultaneously, this can be construed as concurrent action on the part of different agents, or as concomitant changes to observables derived from a single agent action via dependencies. To craft the connection given-in-experience between the construal and referent, the maker constructs the construal in such a way that its observables, dependencies and agency correspond closely to those that are observed in the referent. To this end, the maker must conceive appropriate ways in which observables and agent actions in the referent can be given suitable experiential counterparts in the construal. The semantic framework shown in Figure 1 resembles that adopted in working with spreadsheets, where the state that is currently displayed in the grid is meaningful only when experienced in conjunction with an external referent. In this setting, the cells serve as observables, their definitions specify the dependencies, and agency is enacted by changing the values or the definitions of cells. In making a construal, the maker explores the roles of each relevant agent by projecting agency upon it as if it were a human agent and identifying observables and dependencies from that perspective. By automating agency, construals can then be used to specify behaviours in much the same way that behaviours can be expressed using macros in conjunction with spreadsheets. In this way, animated construals can emulate program-like behaviours in which the intermediate states are meaningful and live to auditing by the maker. Environments to support Empirical Modelling The development of computer environments for making construals has been an ongoing subject of research over the last thirty years. The many variants of such environments that have been implemented are based on common principles. The network of dependencies that currently connect observables is recorded as a family of definitions. Semantically such definitions resemble the definitions of spreadsheet cells, whereby changes to the values of observables on the right hand side propagate so as to change the value of the observable on the LHS in a conceptually indivisible manner. The dependencies in these networks are acyclic but are also reconfigurable: redefining an observable may introduce a new definition that alters the dependency structure. Observables built into the environment include scalars, geometric and screen display elements: these can be elaborated using multi-level list structures. A dependency is typically represented by a definition which uses a relatively simple functional expression to relate the value of an observable to the values of other observables. Such functions have typically been expressed in fragments of simple procedural code, but the most recent variants of environments of making construals also enable dependency relations to be expressed by suitably contextualised families of definitions. The maker can interact with a construal through redefining existing observables or introducing new observables in an open-ended unconstrained manner. Such interaction has a crucial role in the experimental activity that informs the incremental development of the construal. Triggered actions can be introduced to automate state-change: these perform redefinitions in response to specified changes in the values of observables. Empirical Modelling as a broader view of computing In Figure 1, identifying 'the computer' as the medium in which the construal is created is potentially misleading. The term COMPUTER is not merely a reference to a powerful computational device. In making construals, the primary emphasis is on the rich potential scope for interaction and perceptualisation that the computer enables when used in conjunction with other technologies and devices. The primary motivation for developing Empirical Modelling is to give a satisfactory account of computing that integrates these two complementary roles of the computer. The principles by which James and Dewey sought to reconcile perspectives on agency informed by logic and experience play a crucial role in achieving this integration. The dual role for the computer implicit in Figure 1 is widely relevant to contemporary computing applications. On this basis, Empirical Modelling can be viewed as providing a foundation for a broader view of computing. This perspective is reflected in numerous Empirical Modelling publications on topics such as educational technology, computer-aided design and software development. Making construals has also been proposed as a suitable technique to support constructionism, as conceived by Seymour Papert, and to meet the guarantees for 'construction' as identified by Bruno Latour. Empirical Modelling as generic sense-making? The Turing machine provides the theoretical foundation for the role of the computer as a computational device: it can be regarded as modelling 'a mind following rules'. The practical applications of Empirical Modelling to date suggest that making construals is well-suited to supporting the supplementary role the computer can play in orchestrating rich experience. In particular, in keeping with the pragmatic philosophical stance of James and Dewey, making construals can fulfill an explanatory role by offering contingent explanations for human experience in contexts where computational rules cannot be invoked. In this respect, making construals may be regarded as modelling 'a mind making sense of a situation'. In the same way that the Turing machine is a conceptual tool for understanding the nature of algorithms whose value is independent of the existence of the computer, Empirical Modelling principles and concepts may have generic relevance as a framework for thinking about sense-making without specific reference to the use of a computer. The contribution that William James's analysis of human experience makes to the concept of Empirical Modelling may be seen as evidence for this. By this token, Empirical Modelling principles may be an appropriate way to analyse varieties of empirical modelling that are not computer-based. For instance, it is plausible that the analysis in terms of observables, dependencies and agency that applies to interaction with electronic spreadsheets would also be appropriate for the manual spreadsheets that predated them. Background Empirical Modelling has been pioneered since the early 1980s by Meurig Beynon and the Empirical Modelling Research Group in Computer Science at the University of Warwick. The term 'Empirical Modelling' (EM) has been adopted for this work since about 1995 to reflect the experiential basis of the modelling process in observation and experiment. Special purpose software supporting the central concepts of observable, dependency and agency has been under continuous development (mainly led by research students) since the late 1980s. The principles and tools of EM have been used and developed by many hundreds of students within coursework, project work, and research theses. The undergraduate and MSc module 'Introduction to Empirical Modelling' was taught for many years up to 2013-14 until the retirement of Meurig Beynon and Steve Russ (authors of this article). There is a large website [1] containing research and teaching material with an extensive collection of refereed publications and conference proceedings. The term 'construal' has been used since the early 2000s for the artefacts, or models, made with EM tools. The term has been adapted from its use by David Gooding in the book 'Experiment and the Making of Meaning' (1990) to describe the emerging, provisional ideas that formed in Faraday's mind, and were recorded in his notebooks, as he investigated electromagnetism, and made the first electric motors, in the 1800s. The main practical activity associated with EM - that of 'making construals' - was the subject of an Erasmus+ Project CONSTRUIT! (2014-2017)[2].

Siavash studied music in London where he got his master's degree. He left Iran in 1978 and now lives in Los Angeles. Over the past four decades, he composed songs for artists like Ebi, Moein, Aref, Mansour, Leila Forouhar, Shohreh Solati and others. Biography Ghomayshi during his concert in Kuala Lumpur (2009) Siavash Ghomayshi was born in Ahvaz, Iran on 11 June 1945. He started his career as a composer when he was just 12. Siavash holds a master's degree in classical jazz from Royal Society of Arts in London, England, where he majored in pop music. He worked with some popular bands in England such as the Avengers and the Insects as lead guitarist and lead singer. When he returned to Iran at the age of 25, he started his career mainly as a composer. Ghomayshi has created numerous melodies and lyrics for famous Persian artists. Ghomayshi wrote his first song, called \\"Ghayeghran\\" (\\"Boatman\\") for Zia when he was only 13 old years. Although initially considered a composer, in the latter years he released his first single \\"Farangis\\", and has since continued his work as a singer, composer, arranger, and lyricist. He lived in Iran until the age of 33, then decided to leave the country once again to pursue his career in the United States. In recent years Siavash Ghomayshi has explored electronic music as well such experimentation has introduced new elements into his music and the whole Iranian pop music. He is known as the father of trance music in Iran. Among the 17 albums Ghomayshi has recorded to date, Ragbaar, Rooz-haye Bi-Khatereh (Days with No Memories), Bi Sarzamin-tar az Baad (More Homeless Than The Wind), Taak (The Vine), and last but certainly not the least Yadegari (\\"Memento\\") (2011) have been among his most successful. Because of the popularity of Siavash's voice among young generation, in recent years many singers have followed his style. Although his albums may be considered largely non-political, he expresses a longing for his home country. Ghomayshi has also had significant involvement in albums released by various musical compatriots, \\"The Story of Yours, The Story of Mine\\", \\"Setarehaye Sorbi (1995) and Shab-e-Niloufari (2003)\\", which attracted a lot of attention with great reviews. His music can be considered as Persian- language pop/rock, in contrast to the vocal stylings most often associated with adult contemporary singers. In 2011 in an interview with teamghomayshi.com he stated that Yadegari (\\"Memento\\") (2011) would most probably be his last album, However, till present day, his last album is \\"Sargozasht (2017)\\"; but to let his fans enjoy his music and his unique style, he will be releasing singles.

The reservation includes lands on both sides of the Missouri River. Created in 1870, the reservation is a small part of the lands originally reserved to the tribes by the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851, which allocated nearly 12 million acres (49,000 km¬≤) in North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Nebraska and Wyoming. Location The reservation is located on the Missouri River in (in descending order of reservation land) McLean, Mountrail, Dunn, McKenzie, Mercer and Ward counties. The reservation consists of 988,000 acres (4,000 km¬≤), of which 457,837 acres (1,853 km¬≤) are owned by Native Americans, either as individual allotments or communally by the tribe. The McLean National Wildlife Refuge lies within its boundaries. The Four Bears Bridge, which opened in 2005 replacing the original 1955 Four Bears Bridge, provides access across Lake Sakakawea.

A part of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation is Indian territory of the Three Tribes recognized in the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851).Kappler, Charles J.: Indian Affairs. Laws and Treaties. Vol. 2. Washington, 1904. p. 594. Created in 1870 by the U.S. government, the reservation was named after Fort Berthold, a United States Army fort located on the northern bank of the Missouri River some twenty miles downstream (southeast) from the mouth of the Little Missouri River. The green area (529) on the map turned U.S. territory on April 12, 1870, by executive order. Area 620 and the part of area 621 south of the Missouri remained in possession of the Indians. At the same time, the narrow area north of the Missouri (up to the greenish line) became territory of the Three Tribes. Thus, the United States recognized the Indians' right to the area with their only permanent homes in Like-a-Fishhook Village. By executive order, the tribes' holdings were reduced to the light pink area (621) on July 13, 1880 (although they gained some extra land straight north of the Missouri). On December 14, 1886, the tribes agreed to cede the land outside the nearly rectangular area on both sides of the Missouri indicated with black dots and strokes.Meyer, Roy w.: The Village Indians of the Upper Missouri. The Mandans, Hidatsas and Arikaas. Lincoln and London, 1977, map facing p. 112. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries under the Dawes Act and related laws, the US government redistributed communal holdings of tribes, assigning lots to heads of households. The government was trying to encourage the tribal members to take up subsistence farming in the European-American style. The tribe retained some communal holdings and, since its reorganization in the 1930s, has resisted distribution of individual allotments. The population of the reservation was 6,341 as of the 2010 census. The Tribe reported a total enrollment of 15,013 registered tribe members in March 2016. Many members live in cities because there are more job opportunities. Unemployment on the reservation was at 42%. The 2000 census reported a reservation population of 5,915 persons living on a land area of 1,318.895 sq mi (3,415.923 km¬≤). The creation of Garrison Dam between 1947‚Äì53 and Lake Sakakawea as water reservoir for irrigation, for flood control, and hydroelectric power generation in 1956, increased the proportion of water area on the reservation. It totals 263.778 sq mi (683.182 km¬≤) or one-sixth of the reservation's surface area.Lake Sakakawea History McLean CountyCoyote Warrior: One Man, Three Tribes, and the Trial That Forged a Nation, Second Edition by Paul VanDevelder https://books.google.com/books/about/Coyote_Warrior.html?id=B3B0aYwTzRYC Creation of the lake resulted in flooding of large areas of tribal lands that were devoted to farming and ranching, destroying much of the Three Affiliated Tribes‚Äô economy.

He ran into several problems on the North Face of the Eiger, including a slip while climbing out of the exit cracks; Ludwig V√∂rg caught him by his feet, piercing his hand on Heckmair's crampons as he did so. The success brought Heckmair fame throughout the world, but particularly in his native Germany. The reception included an audience with Adolf Hitler (whom Heckmair had met before after working with Leni Riefenstahl). Although the Nazis used his achievement for propaganda Anderl shunned the publicity and never joined the Nazi party. After serving on the Eastern Front in World War II, he worked as a mountain guide in his native Bavaria, and was one of the driving forces in the formation of a professional association for mountain guides. In addition to the Eiger climb, Heckmair climbed new routes on the Grandes Jorasses and many other alpine mountains. He also participated in expeditions to the Andes and the Himalaya. He was also partially responsible for the development of the \\"two rope\\" climbing system. In 1934, he took part as a reserve of the DSV team (Franz Fischer, Gustav \\"Gustl\\" M√ºller, Matthias W√∂rndle) in the Trofeo Mezzalama ski mountaineering competition.

Birth and parentage  He was born in Grahamstown, South Africa to Selmar Schonland (botanist and a founder of Rhodes University) and Flora MacOwan, daughter of Peter MacOwan.  Education  In 1910 Schonland matriculated at the age of 14 from St. Andrew's College as the top pupil in the Cape Province. He later studied at Rhodes University and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge in the years 1914-15 and 1919-20.  World War I service  During World War I, Schonland volunteered for service and served with the Signal Service of the Royal Engineers in France 1915-18. He was wounded at Arras, mentioned in despatches and was awarded the OBE.  Early research  After the war he became a research student at the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge University where he studied the scattering of beta particles. In 1922, Schonland returned to South Africa and took up a post at University of Cape Town as a lecturer and later Professor of Physics.  Marriage and children  In 1923 Schonland married Isabel Craib and had one son and two daughters.  Bernard Price Institute  He left Cape Town in 1937 to become the founding director of the Bernard Price Institute of Geophysics at Witwatersrand University where he made significant contributions to the study of atmospheric electricity, photographing lightning and investigating the electric fields generated by thunderclouds. The South African highveld has an exceptionally high lightning incidence which provided abundant material for his work. During this time he spent a scholarship year back at the Cavendish Laboratory, 1927-28.  World War II activity  As a Lt Col, Schonland commanded the South African Special Signals Services at the outbreak of the Second World War and led the development of South Africa's own radar system. In 1941 he went to England to acquire more equipment for South Africa but was requested by Sir John Cockcroft to become superintendent of the Army Operational Research Group of the Air Defence Research and Development Establishment (AORG) at Richmond, Surrey 1941-44. Under his leadership the AORG made significant contributions in a number of fields, especially in the use of radar by the army. By 1944 he was the scientific adviser to Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery with 21st Army Group in England, France and Belgium. By the war's end he held the rank of brigadier.  Post war scientific service  In 1945 Schonland returned to South Africa at the insistence of General Jan Smuts, the Prime Minister, to establish the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. He also resumed his post as director of the Bernard Price Institute at Witwatersrand University and in 1951 became the first Chancellor of Rhodes University, retaining this position until 1962. In 1954, Schonland became the deputy director and later director of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell, Oxfordshire.  Knighthood  He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1960 for his services to British science.  Retirement and death  He retired to the family home near Winchester, in Hampshire, and died after a long illness on 24 November 1972.  Awards  He was awarded the OBE (military), 1919; CBE (military), 1944; and a knighthood, 1960. He was awarded the Chree medal and prize in 1943, the Hughes Medal in 1945, the Elliott Cresson Medal in 1950, presented the inaugural Bernard Price Memorial Lecture in 1951 and was invited to give the Wilkins Lecture in 1955.

Originally, the Iglesia ni Cristo debates and rebukes claims made by fellow Philippine religious organization Ang Dating Daan or MCGI and their presiding minister, Eliseo Soriano, about the beliefs of the Iglesia ni Cristo, primarily regarding the deity of Jesus Christ. Currently, it became a question and answer program about the doctrines of the INC through by e-mail messages by non-members. The name of the program is probably meant to be a pun of the name of Ang Dating Daan, which is Tagalog for \\"The Old Path\\", with the INC claiming their program, Ang Tamang Daan is \\"The Right Path\\". Relations between the two groups have been perennially strained, and both organizations use their respective television programs as well as other media to present \\"evidence\\" which they believe shows contradictions in each other's teachings. History Ang Tamang Daan began regular programming on June 11, 2001, through SBN-21 (until 2003) and NET 25, which was meant only as a counterpoint to Eliseo Soriano's teachings in Ang Dating Daan. However, somewhere in 2006, they decided to air the program just like the other INC programs, mainly to preach the words of the Bible, and not to involve and contradict other beliefs. The format has been adopted to another INC program, Dating Nasa Sumpa Ngayo'y Nasa Tama or \\"Ang Mga Nagsialis Sa Samahang Ang Dating Daan\\" in 2006, featuring former ADD-turned INC members. Marianito Cayao Jr. and Alfie Angeles, both ADD evangelical workers were the main hosts of the program. Marianito Cayao became a full pledge minister of the Iglesia ni Cristo while Alfie Angeles is now a Roman Catholic Augustinian Recollect seminarian. Most of the hosts of the program are the current ministers of the Iglesia ni Cristo such as Rommell Topacio, Christian Perez, Leonardo Pidlaoan, Jr., Lemuel Solano, and Romil Estrellado. In October 31, 2012, the program Ang Tamang Daan has returned and continued to INCTV Channel 49 replaced GEMTV. After a 12 year hiatus, in October 2018, Ang Tamang Daan returned to its original format along with the original hosts of the program including Michael Sandoval.

The compound semiconductors business deals with the crystal growth process, providing a wide range of products including Ultrabright LED Chips as well as blue LED Chips. The solid aluminum capacitor business relies on conductive polymers, a combination of inorganic aluminum materials with organic polymers. The products offer with high heat resistance and high capacitance. The electronics sector also produces aluminum-based and glass-based hard disks as well as aluminum substrates for hard disks. In September 2008 SDK announced a consolidation their hard disk (HD) media operations by establishing a joint venture with Hoya corporation in January 2009. The joint venture was to be owned about 75% by SDK and about 25% by HOYA. However, this joint venture ended in March 2009 due to the rapid deterioration of the global economy in the Hard Disk Sector.  Inorganics Sector  The Inorganics Sector consists of the Ceramics Division, Carbons Division and Fine Carbon Department. *Ceramics Division SDK's Ceramics products are used in a wide range of fields, including chemical products, refractory products, ceramics, paper manufacture, plastics and electronics.

Aluminium Sector automobile air conditioners are manufactured in the Showa Aluminium Czech factory in Kladno, Czech Republic SDK produces heat exchangers, beverage cans, and other high value-added fabricated products from aluminum materials (including rolled, extruded and forged products). Controversy =Niigata Minamata disease= The company is known for causing the second outbreak of Minamata disease (a type of severe mercury poisoning) in Kanose, currently part of Aga- machi, Niigata Prefecture, through the release of organomercury compounds into the Agano River. = Tryptophan contamination = In the 1980s Showa Denko applied genetic engineering to the bacteria it used in the fermentation through which it manufactured tryptophan so that the bacteria would be more efficient. At the same time, they also changed the technique used to purify the tryptophan.Edward A Belongia, MD. Toxic Tryptophan? Investigating the Eosinophila Myalgia Syndrome in Minnesota. Chapter 26 in Cases in Field Epidemiology: A Global Perspective. Ed Mark Dworkin. Jones & Bartlett Learning, 2011 Some epidemiological studies traced an outbreak of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) to L-tryptophan supplied by Showa Denko.U. S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements. February 2001 FDA Information Paper on L-tryptophan and 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan It was further hypothesized that one or more trace impurities produced during the manufacture of tryptophan may have been responsible for the EMS outbreak. The fact that the Showa Denko facility used genetically engineered bacteria to produce L-tryptophan gave rise to speculation that genetic engineering was responsible for such impurities. However, the methodology used in the initial epidemiological studies has been criticized. An alternative explanation for the 1989 EMS outbreak is that large doses of tryptophan produce metabolites which inhibit the normal degradation of histamine and excess histamine in turn has been proposed to cause EMS. Once the link between EMS and Showa Denko's tryptophan had been established, chemical analyses of the tryptophan was performed by researchers at the Mayo Clinic, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Japanese National Institute of Hygienic Sciences to determine if any contaminants were associated with EMS. Showa Denko reportedly destroyed the GM bacterial stocks after the EMS cases began to emerge. In 2017, the last of the 6 contaminant associated with the 1989 EMS disease outbreak, labelled Peak AAA, has been identified using high-resolution mass spectroscopy.

The Community of Sant'Egidio, based in Rome, was formerly involved in the peace talks in Mozambique, facilitating the eleven rounds of negotiations in Rome that helped to end the Mozambican Civil War. The Community has worked closely with both the Mozambican Ministry of Health and the United States' PEPFAR in order to implement the DREAM program. The DREAM program is designed to give access to free ARV treatment with generic HAART drugs to the poor in Africa on a large scale: So far, 5,000 people are receiving ARV treatment, especially in Mozambique, but the program is being built up also in other countries, including Angola, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Swaziland and Tanzania. Despite being free, the program aims at excellence in treatment, providing the best existent range of drugs (HAART) and regular blood testing according to European standards. It is linked with a nutrition program as well as guidance and sanitary education by volunteers (other HIV patients taking part in the program), which encourages new patients to comply and come to the appointments. The compliance rate is very high (94 percent). The annual cost per person and year of the program is $800.

It establishes a nuclear \\"threshold,\\" by prohibiting nuclear tests of devices having a yield exceeding 150 kilotons after March 31, 1976. The threshold is militarily important since it removes the possibility of testing new or existing nuclear weapons going beyond the fractional-megaton range. In the 1960s, many tests above 150 kilotons were conducted by both countries. The mutual restraint imposed by the Treaty reduced the explosive force of new nuclear warheads and bombs which could otherwise be tested for weapons systems. Of particular significance was the relationship between explosive power of reliable, tested warheads and first-strike capability. Agreement on the Threshold Test Ban Treaty was reached during the summit meeting in Moscow in July 1974. Ratification did not occur until 1990 for a number of reasons, including agreeing on ways to verify compliance. To address this issue, both countries agreed to the Joint Verification Experiment in 1988. Provisions The treaty included a protocol which detailed technical data to be exchanged and which limited weapon testing to specific designated test sites to assist verification. The data to be exchanged included information on the geographical boundaries and geology of the testing areas. Geological data‚Äîincluding such factors as density of rock formation, water saturation, and depth of the water table‚Äîare useful in verifying test yields because the seismic signal produced by a given underground nuclear explosion varies with these factors at the test location. After an actual test has taken place, the geographic coordinates of the test location are to be furnished to the other party, to help in placing the test in the proper geological setting and thus in assessing the yield. The treaty also stipulates that data will be exchanged on a certain number of tests for calibration purposes. By establishing the correlation between stated yields of explosions at the specified sites and the seismic signals produced, this exchange improved assessments by both parties of the yields of nuclear explosions based primarily on the measurements derived from their seismic instruments. The tests used for calibration purposes may be tests conducted in the past or new tests. Agreement to exchange the detailed data described above represented a significant degree of direct cooperation by the two major nuclear powers in the effort to control nuclear weapons. For the first time, each party agreed to make available to the other data relating to its nuclear weapons test program. Technical issues The technical problems associated with a yield threshold were recognized by the sides in the spring of 1974. In this context the Soviet Union mentioned the idea of some misunderstandings concerning occasional, minor, unintended breaches. Discussions on the subject of such an understanding took place in the autumn of 1974 and in the spring of 1976. The Soviet Union was informed by the United States that the understanding reached would be included as part of the public record associated with submitting the Treaty to the Senate for advice and consent to ratification. The entire understanding is as follows: Both Parties will make every effort to comply fully with all the provisions of the TTB Treaty. However, there are technical uncertainties associated with predicting the precise yields of nuclear weapons tests. These uncertainties may result in slight, unintended breaches of the 150 kiloton threshold. Therefore, the two sides have discussed this problem and agreed that: (1) one or two slight, unintended breaches per year would not be considered a violation of the Treaty; (2) such breaches would be a cause for concern, however, and, at the request of either Party, would be the subject for consultations.

That is, rather than each variable in the data set contributing equally to the final result, some of the data is adjusted to make a greater contribution than others. This is analogous to the practice of adding (extra) weight to one side of a pair of scales in order to favour either the buyer or seller. While weighting may be applied to a set of data, such as epidemiological data, it is more commonly applied to measurements of light, heat, sound, gamma radiation, and in fact any stimulus that is spread over a spectrum of frequencies.  Weighting and loudness  In the measurement of loudness, for example, a weighting filter is commonly used to emphasise frequencies around 3 to 6 kHz where the human ear is most sensitive, while attenuating very high and very low frequencies to which the ear is insensitive. A commonly used weighting is the A-weighting curve, which results in units of dBA sound pressure level. Because the frequency response of human hearing varies with loudness, the A-weighting curve is correct only at a level of 40-phon and other curves known as B, C and D weighting are also used, the latter being particularly intended for the measurement of aircraft noise.  Weighting in audio measurement  In broadcasting and audio equipment measurements 468-weighting is the preferred weighting to use because it was specifically devised to allow subjectively valid measurements on noise, rather than pure tones. It is often not realised that equal loudness curves, and hence A-weighting, really apply only to tones, as tests with noise bands show increased sensitivity in the 5 to 7 kHz region on noise compared to tones. Other weighting curves are used in rumble measurement and flutter measurement to properly assess subjective effect. In each field of measurement, special units are used to indicate a weighted measurement as opposed to a basic physical measurement of energy level. For sound, the unit is the phon (1 kHz equivalent level). In the fields of acoustics and audio engineering, it is common to use a standard curve referred to as A-weighting, one of a set that are said to be derived from equal-loudness contours.  Weighting and gamma rays  In the measurement of gamma rays or other ionising radiation, a radiation monitor or dosimeter will commonly use a filter to attenuate those energy levels or wavelengths that cause the least damage to the human body but letting through those that do the most damage, so any source of radiation may be measured in terms of its true danger rather than just its strength. The resulting unit is the sievert or microsievert.  Weighting and television colour components  Another use of weighting is in television, in which the red, green and blue components of the signal are weighted according to their perceived brightness. This ensures compatibility with black and white receivers and also benefits noise performance and allows separation into meaningful luminance and chrominance signals for transmission.  Weighting and UV factor derivation for sun exposure  Skin damage due to sun exposure is very wavelength dependent over the UV range 295 to 325 nm, with power at the shorter wavelength causing around 30 times as much damage as the longer one. In the calculation of UV Index, a weighting curve is used which is known as the McKinlay-Diffey Erythema action spectrum.  Weighting in 3D modeling and animation Weighting in the context of 3D modeling and animation refers to how closely the components of a soft body follow their \\"target\\", \\"guide\\", \\"goal\\", or \\"controller\\". Components (usually vertices) with higher weights follow (or \\"conform\\" to) their guide quite closely, but those with lower weights do not. Here are some examples: = Skeleton structure = Often, when an object is rigged with a skeleton, weights are applied to the vertices near the joints. The vertices closer to the joint will usually have a lower weight assigned; the reason is so that during deformation, the geometry of the skin does not fold in on itself. Weighting in this situation will most of the time be done automatically using skinning techniques but is often done by hand fine tune the skeleton's deformation effects. Another example of using weights with a skeleton structure would be to actually apply weights to vertices that are not part of a character's skin. An appropriate situation for this method would be the case when an elephant's trunk dangles freely as it walks. The elephant's trunk is rigged with a skeleton and inverse kinematic (IK) curve. Then, a goal curve is created so that the IK curve has something to \\"aim for\\" and thus the trunk has a certain shape to which it conforms. Closer to the end of the trunk, the vertices of the IK curve are given lower weights. Thus, for example, if the goal curve was parented to the elephant and a gravity field was in effect, if the elephant stopped walking, the end of the IK curve and, thus, the end of the trunk would continue to move, dangle back and forth, ultimately coming to a rest in the position determined by the goal curve. = Cloth = Weights are used with cloth as well. For instance, if a character was being outfitted with a dress, around the waist, the cloth should stay attached to the character, but farther down, its movements should be governed more by effects directly induced by the neighbouring cloth vertices than by the hip movements of the character. Higher weights are then applied to the cloth vertices close to the hip so that they hug the character quite closely compared to the cloth farther down the dress. To make the dress more realistic, it is possible to assign cloth weights of even 0 to much of the dress because springs hold the cloth together; one must keep in mind, however, that doing this for the entire dress would effectively cancel the attachment of the dress to the character.

Akoko are a large Yoruba cultural sub-group in the Northeastern part of Yorubaland, the area spans from Ondo state to Edo state in southwest Nigeria. Akoko land takes a large percentage of the local governments in Ondo state. Out of the present 18 Local Government Councils it takes four, Akoko North-East, Akoko North-West, Akoko South-East and Akoko South-West, as well as the Akoko Edo LGA of Edo State. The Adekunle Ajasin University, a state owned university, is located in Akungba-Akoko. A state specialist hospital is at Ikare Akoko, while a general hospital is located in Oka-Akoko. Geography Akoko comprises about 40 small towns, predominantly situated in rocky areas of Ondo state. The rocky terrain nevertheless, may have helped the region to become a melting pot of sorts with different cultures coming from the north, eastern and southern Yoruba towns and beyond. Akoko became one of the few Yoruba clans with no distinctive local dialect of their own. Major Akoko settlements include Oka, Ikare, Oba, Ikun, Arigidi, Ogbagi, Okeagbe, Ikaram, Ibaram, Iyani, Akungba, Erusu, Ajowa, Akunu, Gedegede, Isua, Auga, Ikakumo, Supare, Epinmi, Ipe, Ifira, Ise, Iboropa, Irun, Iye Afin, Igashi, Sosan, Ipesi, Etioro, Ayegunle and Oyin. In addition to this group, there are several other autonomous communities. Akoko is popularly known as the home of education and has the second largest number of professors in the country, with the Ekiti taking the lead. Ikare Akoko is the biggest city in the Akoko area. It has an I.C.T resource center where its people have the opportunity to connect to and communicate with other individuals across the country and around the world. In addition, the city also has the largest number of cybercafes in the Akoko area. Also another big and well known general Hospital is being located in Ipe Akoko, and a big secondary school Ipe High School. Oba Akoko is another town in Akoko South West Local Government. Oba is the gateway to Akoko Land, share border with Owo Local Government. Oba was made the Local Government Headquarter when Akoko South East Local Government was newly created before the headquarter was relocated to Isua Akoko but Oba was later compensated with Area Council Authority. Oba has a very large landmass good for agriculture and avail other Akokos the opportunity to farm on her land. Auga-Akoko is a small town located at the North-East of Ikare with about 3000 population mostly involved in farming activities. They are known for production of Cocoa, Coffea, Yam, Cassava which is locally processed to \\"Gari\\" as it is called. Auga is made of two towns: Okemole whose inhabitants are predominantly Muslims and Okegbagbo, about 3 km apart. Akunnu Akoko is another town in Akoko North East local government Akunnu Akoko is the Ondo state border community to Kogi state. The people are known for passion for education, hard work, diligence, civilazation and prominency especially in area of politics. Iye Akoko is also a small town surrounded by rocky hills in Akoko North West Local Government Area of Akoko. Iye is located between Arigidi, Ogbagi and Okeagbe having Iye at the middle. Industry Predominant traditional occupations of the community include large scale farming and teaching. In contemporary time, military, policing and para-military is the common denominator of all Akoko communities. This is clearly displayed in the fact that every Akoko state constituency produced in the last 20 years at least a commissioner of police or equivalent in the other military and para-military (Customs, Immigration, Prisons, Federal Road Safety Corps etc.). Akoko also produced the most prominent chief executive officer of the Federal Road Safety Corps in the person of Dr. Olu Agunloye and the former Inspector General of Police Gabriel Sunday Ehindero.

The village is to the west of the River Ouse, Sussex and has a church dedicated to Saint Peter. Southease railway station lies roughly a kilometre east over the river and may be reached via a swing bridge. The church has one of only three round towers in Sussex, all of which are located in the Ouse Valley and all three built in the first half of the 12th century. It is downstream of Lewes, the county town of East Sussex and upstream of Piddinghoe and Newhaven. Paths along both the banks of the river allow hiking in either direction along the river. The remains of a slipway on the west bank of the Ouse just north of the bridge faces Mount Caburn. The nearest village is Rodmell, about a kilometre to the northwest. The South Downs Way winds its way through the village towards the nearby River Ouse and the railway station. A new bridge has been built over the A26.New Bridge over A26 near Southease Most cottages in the village date from the 17th century. The population of the village is about forty. History Southease Green =Name= The name seems to be of Anglo- Saxon origin, meaning \\"South land overgrown with brushwood\\". =Historical record= The village first appears in the historical record when King Edgar granted the manor of Southease (including Southease parish, 38 hides, a church and part of South Heighton) to Hyde Abbey. It was granted to the abbey again by King √Üthelred in 996. The church dates from the year 966.Southease, Rodmell, Telscombe, Louise Schweitzer At the time of the Domesday Book a thriving community was in place and the village appears to have been the biggest herring fishery in the district, having been assessed for 38,500 herring while Brighton had a mere 4,000. Village history is closely linked with the Ouse and Lewes Levels. In the 11th to 13th centuries drainage of the river allowed more crops to be grown, but subsequent flooding led to more relying on fishing. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the manor probably remained in possession of the King and in 1546 one John Kerne was appointed bailiff and collector of the manors of Southease, Telscombe and Heighton. There was never a manor house in Southease as it was always owned by absentee landlords. The manor passed to the Sackville family ‚Äì it was held by Thomas Sackville, his widow Cicely and their grandson Robert. The Lower Ouse Improvement Act of 1791 required the ferry to be replaced with a bridge substantial enough to allow cattle, people and vehicles to pass over while allowing ships to pass. The original bridge was a wooden cantilever bridge slightly to the north of the current one. The wooden bridge was demolished in 1879 when it was replaced by the current one. The population of the parish declined through the 19th century. The census recorded a population of 120 in 1841 with the population falling with each census to 66 in 1891. The village was part of the Holmstrow hundred until the abolition of hundreds in the 19th century. During World War II four Type 24 pillboxes were built, roughly at the corners of the village, with a Type 28 pillbox just to the north. The former were for rifles and light machine guns and the latter was for a 2-pounder anti-tank gun or a 6-pounder Hotchkiss gun. There was also a Prisoner-of-war camp containing 16 Nissen huts near the northern farm, the concrete bases of which are still visible. There was also an anti-aircraft gun. The body of the writer Virginia Woolf was found on 18 April 1941, at Asham Wharf on the east bank of the Ouse, to the north of the bridge, after her suicide by drowning on March 28.Newhaven to Lewes walk ‚Äì mentions Asham Wharf The church bells were rehung in 2000.

In 1966‚Äì67 he was an independent collaborator at the Electronic Studio of the WDR, where he assisted Karlheinz Stockhausen with the production of his electronic work Hymnen. He also operated the live-electronics in the first performances of the chamber- orchestra version of Stockhausen's Mixtur (1967), and in the Darmstadt collaborative works directed by Stockhausen, Ensemble in 1967 and Musik f√ºr ein Haus in 1968 (; ; ). In 1968 he was also instructor of electronic music at the Cologne Courses for New Music . From its formation in Cologne in 1968, he collaborated with the group formed by bass guitarist Holger Sch√ºring (later known as Holger Czukay), keyboardist Irmin Schmidt, guitarist Michael Karoli and drummer Jaki Liebezeit in an experimental beat group that would later be known as Can. He left in 1969, disappointed at growing rock influences. In 1970 he performed in a number of Stockhausen's \\"process\\" works (Spiral, Pole, Expo) at the German Pavilion of Expo 70, the Osaka World's Fair (; ). After Osaka, together with Johannes Fritsch and Rolf Gehlhaar, he founded in 1971 the Feedback Studio in Cologne and became a technical collaborator in the Studio for Electronic Music of the Rijksuniversiteit Utrecht.

It was proven by Leslie Valiant and Vijay Vazirani in their paper titled NP is as easy as detecting unique solutions published in 1986. The proof is based on the Mulmuley‚ÄìVazirani‚ÄìVazirani isolation lemma, which was subsequently used for a number of important applications in theoretical computer science. The Valiant‚ÄìVazirani theorem implies that the Boolean satisfiability problem, which is NP-complete, remains a computationally hard problem even if the input instances are promised to have at most one satisfying assignment. Proof outline Unambiguous-SAT is the promise problem of deciding whether a given Boolean formula that has at most one satisfying assignment is unsatisfiable or has exactly one satisfying assignment. In the first case, an algorithm for Unambiguous-SAT should reject, and in the second it should accept the formula. If the formula has more than one satisfying assignment, then there is no condition on the behavior of the algorithm. The promise problem Unambiguous-SAT can be decided by a nondeterministic Turing machine that has at most one accepting computation path. In this sense, this promise problem belongs to the complexity class UP (which is usually only defined for languages). The proof of the Valiant‚ÄìVazirani theorem consists of a probabilistic reduction from SAT to SAT such that, with probability at least \\\\Omega(1/n), the output formula has at most one satisfying assignment, and thus satisfies the promise of the Unambiguous-SAT problem. More precisely, the reduction is a randomized polynomial-time algorithm that maps a Boolean formula F(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n) with n variables x_1,\\\\dots,x_n to a Boolean formula F'(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n) such that * every satisfying assignment of F' also satisfies F, and * if F is satisfiable, then, with probability at least \\\\Omega(1/n), F' has a unique satisfying assignment (a_1,\\\\dots,a_n). By running the reduction a polynomial number t of times, each time with fresh independent random bits, we get formulas F'_1,\\\\dots,F'_t. Choosing t=O(n), we get that the probability that at least one formula F'_i is uniquely satisfiable is at least 1/2 if F is satisfiable. This gives a Turing reduction from SAT to Unambiguous-SAT since an assumed algorithm for Unambiguous-SAT can be invoked on the F'_i. Then the random self-reducibility of SAT can be used to compute a satisfying assignment, should it exist. Overall, this proves that NP = RP if Unambiguous-SAT can be solved in RP. The idea of the reduction is to intersect the solution space of the formula F with k random affine hyperplanes over \\\\text{GF}(2)^n, where k\\\\in\\\\\\\\{1,\\\\dots,n\\\\\\\\} is chosen uniformly at random. An alternative proof is based on the isolation lemma by Mulmuley, Vazirani, and Vazirani. They consider a more general setting, and applied to the setting here this gives an isolation probability of only \\\\Omega(1/n^8).

The front facade around the main entrance was clad in granite, the entrance itself having a bronze screen. The first three floors of the building were clad in granite; the upper floors in limestone. On the third floor, the facade was wrapped in elaborate stonework in geometric and floral motifs, which also adorned the interior and the limestone piers at the crest of the building. The first six floors were built in reinforced concrete, while the tower was built with a structural steel frame. parapets from the Toronto Star building's sixth and other floors, now located at the Guild Park and Gardens. The first six stories held the offices of the Star, and the rest was rental office space. The 21st floor housed the newspaper's radio studios. The ground floor facing King Street housed a few retail stores and a Stoodleigh's Restaurant at the east end. The basement had a restaurant and barbershop.

It is defined in terms of an object's physical size, x, and \\\\theta the angular size of the object as viewed from earth. d_A= \\\\frac{x}{\\\\theta} The angular diameter distance depends on the assumed cosmology of the universe. The angular diameter distance to an object at redshift, z , is expressed in terms of the comoving distance, r as: d_A = \\\\frac{S_k(r)}{1+z} Where S_k(r) is the FLRW coordinate defined as: S_k(r) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\sin \\\\left( \\\\sqrt{-\\\\Omega_k} H_0 r \\\\right)/\\\\left(H_0\\\\sqrt{\\\\Omega_k}\\\\right) & \\\\Omega_k < 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ r & \\\\Omega_k=0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sinh \\\\left( \\\\sqrt{\\\\Omega_k} H_0 r\\\\right)/\\\\left(H_0\\\\sqrt{\\\\Omega_k}\\\\right) & \\\\Omega_k >0 \\\\end{cases} Where \\\\Omega_k is the curvature density and H_0 is the value of the Hubble parameter today. In the currently favoured geometric model of our Universe, the \\"angular diameter distance\\" of an object is a good approximation to the \\"real distance\\", i.e. the proper distance when the light left the object. Note that beyond a certain redshift, the angular diameter distance gets smaller with increasing redshift. In other words, an object \\"behind\\" another of the same size, beyond a certain redshift (roughly z=1.5), appears larger on the sky, and would therefore have a smaller \\"angular diameter distance\\". Angular size redshift relation Lambda cosmology, with on the vertical scale kiloparsecs per arcsecond. Lambda cosmology, with on the vertical scale megaparsecs. The angular size redshift relation describes the relation between the angular size observed on the sky of an object of given physical size, and the objects redshift from Earth (which is related to its distance, d , from Earth). In a Euclidean geometry the relation between size on the sky and distance from Earth would simply be given by the equation: \\\\tan\\\\left ( \\\\theta \\\\right )= \\\\frac{x}{d} where \\\\theta is the angular size of the object on the sky, x is the size of the object and d is the distance to the object. Where \\\\theta is small this approximates to: \\\\theta \\\\approx \\\\frac{x}{d} . However, in the ŒõCDM model (the currently favored cosmology), the relation is more complicated. In this model, objects at redshifts greater than about 1.5 appear larger on the sky with increasing redshift. This is related to the angular diameter distance, which is the distance an object is calculated to be at from \\\\theta and x , assuming the Universe is Euclidean. The actual relation between the angular-diameter distance, d_A, and redshift is given below. q_0 is called the deceleration parameter and measures the deceleration of the expansion rate of the Universe; in the simplest models, q_0<0.5 corresponds to the case where the Universe will expand forever, q_0>0.5 to closed models which will ultimately stop expanding and contract q_0=0.5 corresponds to the critical case ‚Äì Universes which will just be able to expand to infinity without re-contracting. d_A=\\\\cfrac{c}{H_0 q^2_0} \\\\cfrac{(zq_0+(q_0 -1)(\\\\sqrt{2q_0 z+1}-1))}{(1+z)^2} The Mattig relation yields the angular-diameter distance as a function of redshift for a universe with Œ©Œõ = 0.

It ran from March 11, 2001 to November 28, 2004 on Pax TV. Although set in New York City, all the episodes were shot in and around Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Plot summary Doc follows rural doctor Clint \\"Doc\\" Cassidy who has taken a position at Westbury Clinic, a small medical center in New York City. Doc is a young Christian bachelor from the mountains of Montana, who brings his small-town values and ideology to an environment that seems to lack familiarity with them. Supporting characters include the doctors, nurses and other staff of Westbury Clinic; a 10-year-old orphan, Ra√∫l Garc√≠a; and a young couple, Nate and Beverly Jackson, who live in the same apartment building as Clint. =Themes= Each episode has three interconnecting plot lines; the predominant plot line follows Clint and his involvement in the lives of his patients. Another plot line involves Clint's relationship with his clinic coworkers, and the third involves the Jackson Family. In later seasons, the Jackson family plot line or the clinic plot line are occasionally left out in preference to the predominant Clint one. The plot lines are then resolved at the end of each episode, when Clint writes an email to his guardian, Doc Johansson, back in Montana. Characters =Westbury Clinic= * Dr. Clint \\"Doc\\" Cassidy (played by Billy Ray Cyrus) is a kindhearted doctor from Montana who has moved to New York to work at Westbury Clinic, a medical center adjacent to the local hospital. He initially left Montana to be with his girlfriend Samantha (Claudette Mink). Clint breaks up with her in the pilot because she and he are from two different worlds. Clint has a love for God and for people, making him a popular doctor at the clinic. He often likes to insert some bits of wisdom from Montana into the clinic team's activity. It is mentioned in some episodes that Clint's parents died when he was young; he was taken in by his hometown's doctor, Doc Johansson. This adoption leads to Clint's love for medicine. He is the show's main character. * Nancy Nichols (Andrea C. Robinson) is a young nurse who is smart, energizing, and a bit vain. She possesses good bedside manners, common sense, and a sharp wit. She isn't afraid to speak her mind. Nancy's parents divorced when she was twelve, and Nancy had a touching reunion with her mother, who had cancer at the time. This reunion, and the mother eventually succumbing to her cancer, were the focuses of two episodes of the shows. She and Clint have a mutual relationship. This is the focus of several episodes. Clint proposes to her in the final episode and she says \\"yes\\". * Dr. Derek Hebert (Derek McGrath) is a portly, witty, but insightful doctor who is a very good friend of Clint's. Derek is friends with all of the clinical team (with the exception of Dr. Crane) and, despite his soft-spoken personality, never afraid to get involved in anything the clinic is involved in. Derek has a wife, Nellie, and a child, Gracie. He has a fear of small rodents, especially rats and mice. * Donna Dewitt (Ruth Marshall) is the clinic-hospital administrator. She combines a warm heart with a focus on the bottom line. Her occasional role as an antagonist as a result of her goal of cutting costs contrasts with her warmth, approachability and unfailing support of the rest of the staff. * Dr. Oliver Crane (Ron Lea) is frequently the antagonist of the series. He is egotistical and selfish, and usually more concerned with his individual convenience and getting recognition from peers (especially outside of the clinic) than with his patients. He is also a schemer in a sense, trying to get money and compliments, but these almost always fail. But despite his mean and outspoken personality, Oliver did soften slightly toward the end of the show's run. * Tippy Williams, later Tippy Doss (Paula Boudreau), appears in the pilot episode, and joins Westbury later in the first season. She thinks differently than most people, and often comes across as a bit of a dimwit. She keeps the team on their toes in a silly, geeky way. However, shining through Tippy's somewhat woolly mind is a heart of gold that loves, sacrifices, and longs to learn. =Jackson Family= * Nate Jackson (Richard Leacock) is an officer with the New York Police Department. Nate Jackson is initially skeptical of Clint's country ways, but the two become close friends quickly. Nate is also a building supervisor, and arranges an apartment for Clint. He affectionately gives Clint the nickname \\"Country\\". * Raul Garcia (Tyler Posey) is an orphaned boy who is 8 years old when the series starts and around 11‚Äì12 when it ends. He and his single mother were homeless, and they slept in the basement of a New York church before Mrs. Garcia became ill and died. Despite attempts to take Raul into custody by his abusive father, Raul ends up getting adopted by Nate and Beverly Jackson. He is a normal preteen boy who gets instruction on making wise choices from and his parents and from Clint, among others. * Beverly Jackson (Tracy Shreve) is Nate's caring, conscientious wife who teaches at Raul's school. She gets pregnant in the first half of season three, then gives birth to a baby, Mattie, at the end of the season. =Other supporting characters= * Justin (Demetrius Joyette) is Raul's best friend from school. They're good friends who often hang out together. Justin is a bit younger than Raul and sometimes lacks his older friend's good sense. * Elliot (Taylor Abrahamse) is an aspiring violinist, but somewhat of a nerd. Raul and Justin are reluctant to hang out with him at first, but they soon come to learn that he is a good friend indeed. * Steve \\"The Captain (later 'Major')\\" Doss (Kevin Jubinville) is a soldier in the U.S. Army who falls in love with Tippy and eventually marries her. He is generally good-natured and very army savvy (he speaks in the manner of a soldier on duty), but he has a tendency to be turgid and act irrationally. * Jelly Bean (Kenny Robinson) and Junior (Billy Otis) are street Peddlers and good friends of Clint's. When they first met they tried to rob Clint but he stopped them and helped them change their ways. * Dr. Harley Johanson (Neil Dainard) Is a mentor and friend to Clint Cassidy. He lives in Montana and is one of Clint's Best friends. Clint sees Harley as a father figure. Clint often e-mail's Harley at the end of each episode. He appears in 23 episodes. =Notable guest stars= * Christian singer Steven Curtis Chapman appears in the season two episode \\"Fearless\\", as Raul's music teacher, Daniel Parson * Cyrus' real-life daughter Miley Cyrus appears in three episodes; her on-screen acting debut in the Pilot (Part one; uncredited) as Kylie in season two, episode eight (credited as Destiny Hope); and in season four, episode six as Raul's friend; Cyrus's daughter Noah Cyrus appears in six episodes as Gracie Hebert *Michael Cera appears in two season two episodes as Max, a distraught preteen boy whose parents are on the edge of divorce *Sue Thomas appears in season five, episode seven * Christian singer Jaci Velasquez appears in the season five episode \\"Nip, Tuck & Die\\" * Christian singer CeCe Winans appears in season three, episode seven as Rosalyn Franklin, a poor Black widow whose young son has leukemia Episodes =Season 1 (2001)= { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%; background:#fff;\\" - ! style=\\"background:#;\\" No. overall ! style=\\"background:#;\\" No. in season ! style=\\"background:#;\\" Title ! style=\\"background:#;\\" Directed by ! style=\\"background:#;\\" Written by ! style=\\"background:#;\\" Original air date } =Season 2 (2001‚Äì02)= { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%; background:#fff;\\" - ! style=\\"background:#;\\" No. overall ! style=\\"background:#;\\" No. in season ! style=\\"background:#;\\" Title ! style=\\"background:#;\\" Directed by ! style=\\"background:#;\\" Written by ! style=\\"background:#;\\" Original air date } =Season 3 (2002‚Äì03)= { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%; background:#fff;\\" - ! style=\\"background:#;\\" No. overall ! style=\\"background:#;\\" No. in season ! style=\\"background:#;\\" Title ! style=\\"background:#;\\" Directed by ! style=\\"background:#;\\" Written by ! style=\\"background:#;\\" Original air date } =Season 4 (2003‚Äì04)= { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%; background:#fff;\\" - ! style=\\"background:#;\\" No. overall ! style=\\"background:#;\\" No. in season ! style=\\"background:#;\\" Title ! style=\\"background:#;\\" Directed by ! style=\\"background:#;\\" Written by ! style=\\"background:#;\\" Original air date } =Season 5 (2004)= { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%; background:#fff;\\" - ! style=\\"background:#;\\" No. overall ! style=\\"background:#;\\" No. in season ! style=\\"background:#;\\" Title ! style=\\"background:#;\\" Directed by ! style=\\"background:#;\\" Written by ! style=\\"background:#;\\" Original air date } Broadcast Doc was broadcast on PAX TV and has Christian undertones.

It was founded in 1969, and currently lists around 50 stocks. The exchange is under the control of the state-run Financial Market Council. The government has provided tax breaks to increase the number of listings, but companies have been slow in going public. The creation of the award was in February 1969. Although this creation is relatively old, the role of the stock market in financing Tunisia's economy has remained limited or insignificant due to the dominance of the state and banks . This results in significant levels of money creation and inflation. This period is characterized by ease of access to bank loans and state aid, a very advantageous remuneration of deposits with banks that are regulated, protected and exempt income and a fairly heavy taxation of stock market investments. The award will be increasingly seen as a registrar of transactions as a mirror of the economy having its place in the corporate finance. Moreover, the market capitalization represents just 1% of GDP at the end of 1986. As part of the structural adjustment plan, a financial market reform started in 1988 with the aim of establishing a legal framework allowing the market to contribute to the financing of the economy. Deposits with banks are taxed, the rates of interest on deposits are falling as a result of lower inflation and savings in securities enjoys favorable taxation with the abolition of taxation on most -values and dividends. The tax on corporate profits also down 80% to 35%. To meet international standards, reform is adopted with the promulgation of the Law of 14 November 1994 on the reorganization of financial market. This law creates the new public regulator: the Financial Market Council, which began operations on 15 November 1995. Following this major reform of the Tunis Stock Exchange that establishes the foundations of a financial market, potentially able to finance part of the economy, the situation continues to evolve fifty companies listed in March 2009, for a market capitalization of up to 8.7 billion dinars (against 3.1 billion in 2004) or 16% of national GDP.

President Fulgencio Batista claimed publicly that the young guerilla leader had been killed during the landing of the yacht Granma, bringing him and others back to Cuba from Mexico in December 1956. Early life The grandson of Jewish immigrants, Matthews was born and raised on Riverside Drive in the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He volunteered for the Army near the end of World War I and graduated from Columbia College of Columbia University. He subsequently joined the New York Times and reported from Europe during the Spanish Civil War.Paul Preston, We Saw Spain Die: Foreign correspondents in the Spanish Civil War, London, UK: Constable and Robinson, 2008. . His coverage of that war and later the Cuban political situation were subject to substantial criticism for showing communist sympathies, a charge Matthews rejected for years. He also reported during the Italian conquest of Ethiopia in 1936; and then wrote Eyewitness in Abyssinia: With Marshal Bodoglio's forces to Addis Ababa in 1937. During this time, he remarked that he viewed history as a series of scrimmages for which he picked a favorite side, regardless of morals or values. He admitted: \\"the right or the wrong of it did not interest me greatly.\\" This contributed to him being labeled a fascist. Interview with Fidel Castro In February 1957, Matthews was invited to Cuba to interview Fidel Castro, leader of the Cuban Revolution.Richard E. Welch, \\"Herbert L. Matthews and the Cuban Revolution.\\" The Historian 47 (1984); Ra√∫l Castro and Che Guevara, La Conquista de la Esperanza, 286: 2 Ruby Phillips, the correspondent in Havana for The New York Times at the time, had received information from an emissary of the 26th of July Movement that Castro wanted to meet with a reporter from one of the most influential papers in the United States. Phillips initially wanted to do the interview herself, but Castro's emissary discouraged her because of the \\"difficult conditions\\" of the Sierra and recommended that a man be sent instead. She agreed, and Matthews seized this opportunity granted to him by Cuban machismo. The interview was conducted in secret so that Fulgencio Batista, the President of Cuba at the time, would not find out about their meeting. Matthews' interview revealed that Fidel Castro was alive, despite claims by Batista that he had been killed the previous year.Welch, \\"Herbert L. Matthews and the Cuban Revolution.\\" 1. This was a shock not only to the United States and Cuba, but also to revolutionaries in Cuba, giving them hope that the revolution could continue. If their leader was still alive, so was the revolution. in the interview, Castro misled Matthews into believing that his rebel force, now engaged in guerrilla warfare as a tactic, was much bigger and more powerful than previously believed. Matthews' portrayal of the army made it seem as though Castro had a large following and that the majority of the Cuban population was aligned with him.Anthony DePalma, \\"Myths of the Enemy: Castro, Cuba and Herbert L. Matthews of The New York Times.\\" (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame, 2004), 3. Both Castro and Matthews understood how surprising the news of his survival would be, so they made a point of taking a picture together and Castro signed the interview, just to add proof of the event. Batista, still trying to crush the uprising by revolutionary forces in Cuba, claimed the photograph was a fake and continued to assert that Castro was dead. The interview has been described as one of the greatest journalistic scoops of the 20th century,DePalma, \\"Myths of the Enemy.\\" 2. both for the information that Castro had survived and the historical context in which the interview was conducted. Despite the death of Stalin, the United States was still engaged in the Cold War to prevent the spread of Communist regimes and the communist ideology, and there was strong anti-Communist sentiment throughout the country. Referring to Castro's army and revolutionary force, Matthews denied any link with Communism. In his article, published on 24 February 1957, he wrote of CastroNew York Times, 24 February 1957. As cited in Welch, \\"Herbert L. Matthews and the Cuban Revolution.\\" 3. Matthews' early claim that Castro was driving an anti-Communist revolution would soon affect not only the image of Castro and the revolution, but also affect how the United States acted toward Cuba in the upcoming years.  Matthews in the Cuban Revolution  Matthews' articles in The New York Times played a significant role in U.S. foreign policy at the time, as in 1958, the articles, which consistently demonstrated the idea that Castro would hold free elections and restore the Cuban constitution, helped persuade Washington to cease the shipment of arms to Batista.DePalma, \\"Myths of the Enemy,\\" 4. Instead, Matthews wanted the United States to spend its energy providing some kind of Marshall Plan for Latin America.Welch, \\"Herbert L. Matthews and the Cuban Revolution,\\" 6. The State Department believed Matthews in his claims that Castro was not a Communist leader, and the constant presence of Castro in the news increased the awareness of the revolution in the United States.Welch, \\"Herbert L. Matthews and the Cuban Revolution,\\" 4-5. Within the United States, as journalist and historian Anthony DePalma states, \\"Castro's dark past was largely replaced in the United States by instant legitimacy\\".DePalma, \\"Myths of the Enemy,\\" 9. Matthews had turned Castro into a likable rebel. Throughout 1959, Matthews visited Cuba several times and constantly continued to deny that Castro was a Communist. He claimed that Castro's revolution itself was not inherently Communist, and that Castro simply wanted a full-blown social revolution.New York Times, 16 July 1959. As cited in Welch, \\"Herbert L. Matthews and the Cuban Revolution,\\" 5. One of Matthews' most famous statements concerning Castro was made on 5 July 1959, and he stated that: As the Cuban revolution continued, Matthews still attempted to prove that Castro's revolution and regime were not linked to Communism, but in 1960, Castro declared that he would adopt the Communist ideals to reshape Cuban society.Welch, \\"Herbert L. Matthews and the Cuban Revolution,\\" 11. Matthews continued to state that the revolution itself had never been associated with Communism and that Castro had not been a Communist when he took power.DePalma, \\"Myths of the Enemy,\\" 17. However, Matthews' efforts were futile, as many, both in the United States and in Cuba, \\"blamed\\" him for the rise of the Communist leader. Several believed that he had known Castro was a Communist, while the some in the State Department claimed that Matthews had led them to believe Castro had democratic intentions and thus postponed their ability to act on the growing Communism.Welch, \\"Herbert L. Matthews and the Cuban Revolution,\\" 12 and 14. There were few academics who did not discredit Matthews' views, and his more opinionated journalistic style was frowned upon.Welch, \\"Herbert L. Matthews and the Cuban Revolution,\\" 15. Legacy Matthews has been compared to Stalin sympathiser Walter Duranty, who preceded him at the Times. His later journalism has been likened to that of three other US foreign correspondents who covered wars and revolutions from the \\"other side\\" and became controversial figures by openly demonstrating their sympathy for the enemy and the revolutionaries: Richard Harding Davis, John Reed, and Edgar Snow reported, respectively, on the Russo-Japanese war (1905-1907), the October 1917 coup d'etat in Russia and the 1949 Communist Revolution in China.DePalma, \\"Myths of the Enemy,\\" 14. The conservative National Review published a caricature of Castro with the caption, \\"I got my job through the New York Times,\\" parodying a contemporary campaign for the newspaper's classified ad section.. (Retrieved 21 November 2018.), 2 March 2017. (Retrieved 21 November 2018.)

It follows the adventures of a small stuffed bear named Bear and his roommate/antagonist, a psychotic housecat named Looshkin. Looshkin often plays cruel, sadistic, and nonsensical pranks on Bear, and it is not uncommon for faeces and dismemberment to come into play. Smart's linework is bold and expressive, and his panels are littered with information and throw-away gags. The stories are marked by a combination of violent shocks, random silliness, and other hallmarks of Dada. 10 issues were published between 2003 and 2005. Smart would later revive the characters of Bear and Looshkin for the children's comic The Phoenix, with Looshkin as the titular character. Characters =Bear= The foil and victim to Looshkin's insanity, Bear is a stuffed animal standing twelve inches tall. Apparently, he has served in the British Army in a great number of wars (ex: World War I). When you poke his nose his head expands, much to his dismay and Looshkin's joy. He hopes that one day Looshkin will die so he will be able to live his life reading books and slowly becoming an alcoholic. Bear is known to date human women, much to Karl's surprise, and he spends a good deal of his time fantasizing about being a ladies' man or a gentleman in a Jane Austen novel. =Looshkin= Looshkin is depicted as a mentally disturbed cat who has a blue pelt. He has large, sharply pointed ears that look like party hats. He is a bipedal creature with opposable thumbs that make him able to pick up objects, much to the displeasure of others. His activities usually consist of senseless babblings and innumerable sadistic acts on people, chiefly his housemate Bear, or whoever is closest when he gets his hands on a likely weapon. He is a humorous character (in the sense of black humor) by some of the things he says or the original comical scenes he'll inflict, such as pretending to be a \\"Gangsta\\" and speaking fluent slang that he picked up from \\"Hood Movies\\" and going by the name LZ. He is maniacal and merciless, and most readers assume that the reason for that is that he has a mental disorder. Karl, Looshkin's hapless bachelor owner, thinks Looshkin is just lonely and needs a female cat to play with, but the traumatized Bear vehemently disagrees. Looshkin appeared in the first Bear comic, in which he had unwittingly forgotten stowing Karl's previous pet dog Marmalade in a closet to protect him from evil bats in the laundry room. As a result, a few days later, Marmalade suffocated and died head-down. However Bear reminds us that Karl's home does not have a laundry room. Looshkin has also been known to have a very vivid imagination, but all of the things he says or does come from his suspected dementia. Looshkin has thought of cloning Bear with a kit that will give him an endless supply of Bear clones on which to waste his days torturing and killing. In Looshkin's words, \\"An endless supply of Bear fodder!\\" In another episode he believed a giant squid that he brought home was a tiger. One of Looshkin's absolute favorite activities is playing with animal carcasses, especially if Bear is around to stuff in them. He also enjoys the black arts, and he often attempts to do horrible things to Bear by casting spells on him or making look alike Bears to annoy/kill/maim. Looshkin is known to buy dangerous weapons off the internet (which he also uses to find cat porn) and run up Karl's credit card bills. =Karl= Karl is Looshkin and Bear's owner. Whenever Looshkin starts causing trouble Karl leaves for 'work.' Karl rarely takes action against Looshkin's attacks on Bear, arguably because he too is afraid of Looshkin to a certain extent. Flashbacks in later Bear comics show that Karl had a difficult childhood and may have been responsible for the death of his uncle. Karl works in a CD store and has strong opinions about music and cultural stereotypes. He likes to go to clubs and on occasion brings Bear and Looshkin with him. Bear is Karl's best friend, and they sometimes have serious discussions although both have acknowledged a distaste for doing so. Karl hasn't had much luck with women, which is partially Looshkin's fault.

They are up to wide, thick, can stretch for hundreds of kilometres, and account for most of the ice leaving the ice sheet. The speed of an ice stream can be over per year, an order of magnitude faster than the surrounding ice. The shear forces at the edge of the ice stream cause deformation and recrystallization of the ice, making it softer, and concentrating the deformation in narrow bands or shear margins. Crevasses form, particularly around the shear margins. Most ice streams have some water at their base, which lubricates the flow. The type of bedrock also is significant. Soft, deformable sediments result in faster flow than hard rock.  Antarctica  The Antarctic Ice Sheet is drained to the sea by several ice streams. The largest in East Antarctica is Lambert Glacier.

It states that for any field k, and any finitely generated commutative k-algebra A, there exists a non- negative integer d and algebraically independent elements y1, y2, ..., yd in A such that A is a finitely generated module over the polynomial ring S = k[y1, y2, ..., yd]. The integer d above is uniquely determined; it is the Krull dimension of the ring A. When A is an integral domain, d is also the transcendence degree of the field of fractions of A over k. The theorem has a geometric interpretation. Suppose A is integral. Let S be the coordinate ring of the d-dimensional affine space \\\\mathbb A^d_k, and A as the coordinate ring of some other d-dimensional affine variety X. Then the inclusion map S -> A induces a surjective finite morphism of affine varieties X\\\\to \\\\mathbb A^d_k. The conclusion is that any affine variety is a branched covering of affine space. When k is infinite, such a branched covering map can be constructed by taking a general projection from an affine space containing X to a d-dimensional subspace. More generally, in the language of schemes, the theorem can equivalently be stated as follows: every affine k-scheme (of finite type) X is finite over an affine n-dimensional space. The theorem can be refined to include a chain of ideals of R (equivalently, closed subsets of X) that are finite over the affine coordinate subspaces of the appropriate dimensions. The form of the Noether normalization lemma stated above can be used as an important step in proving Hilbert's Nullstellensatz. This gives it further geometric importance, at least formally, as the Nullstellensatz underlies the development of much of classical algebraic geometry. The theorem is also an important tool in establishing the notions of Krull dimension for k-algebras.  Proof  The following proof is due to Nagata and is taken from Mumford's red book. A proof in the geometric flavor is also given in the page 127 of the red book and this mathoverflow thread. The ring A in the lemma is generated as a k-algebra by elements, say, y_1, ..., y_m. We shall induct on m. If m = 0, then the assertion is trivial. Assume now m > 0. It is enough to show that there is a subring S of A that is generated by m-1 elements, such that A is finite over S. Indeed, by the inductive hypothesis, we can find algebraically independent elements x_1, ..., x_d of S such that S is finite over k[x_1, ..., x_d]. Since otherwise there would be nothing to prove, we can also assume that there is a nonzero polynomial f in m variables over k such that :f(y_1, \\\\ldots, y_m) = 0. Given an integer r which is determined later, set :z_i = y_i - y_1^{r^{i-1}}, \\\\quad 2 \\\\le i \\\\le m. Then the preceding reads: :f(y_1, z_2 + y_1^r, z_3 + y_1^{r^2}, \\\\ldots, z_m + y_1^{r^{m-1}}) = 0. Now, if a y_1^{\\\\alpha_1} \\\\prod_2^m (z_i + y_1^{r^{i-1}})^{\\\\alpha_i} is a monomial appearing in f, with coefficient a \\\\in k, the highest term in y_1 after expanding the product looks like :a y_1^{\\\\alpha_1 + r \\\\alpha_2 + \\\\cdots + \\\\alpha_m r^{m-1}}. Whenever the above exponent agrees with the highest y_1 exponent produced by some other monomial, it is possible that the highest term in y_1 of f(y_1, z_2 + y_1^r, z_3 + y_1^{r^2}, ..., z_m + y_1^{r^{m-1}}) will not be of the above form, because it may be affected by cancellation. However, if r is larger than any exponent appearing in f, then each \\\\alpha_1 + r \\\\alpha_2 + \\\\cdots + \\\\alpha_m r^{m-1} encodes a unique base r number, so this does not occur. Thus y_1 is integral over S = k[z_2, ..., z_m]. Since y_i = z_i + y_1^{r^{i-1}} are also integral over that ring, A is integral over S. It follows A is finite over S, and since S is generated by m-1 elements, by the inductive hypothesis we are done. If A is an integral domain, then d is the transcendence degree of its field of fractions. Indeed, A and S = k[y_1, ..., y_d] have the same transcendence degree (i.e., the degree of the field of fractions) since the field of fractions of A is algebraic over that of S (as A is integral over S) and S has transcendence degree d. Thus, it remains to show the Krull dimension of the polynomial ring S is d. (this is also a consequence of dimension theory.) We induct on d, with the case d=0 being trivial. Since 0 \\\\subsetneq (y_1) \\\\subsetneq (y_1, y_2) \\\\subsetneq \\\\cdots \\\\subsetneq (y_1, \\\\dots, y_d) is a chain of prime ideals, the dimension is at least d. To get the reverse estimate, let 0 \\\\subsetneq \\\\mathfrak{p}_1 \\\\subsetneq \\\\cdots \\\\subsetneq \\\\mathfrak{p}_m be a chain of prime ideals. Let 0 e u \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{p}_1. We apply the noether normalization and get T = k[u, z_2, \\\\dots, z_d] (in the normalization process, we're free to choose the first variable) such that S is integral over T. By the inductive hypothesis, T/(u) has dimension d - 1. By incomparability, \\\\mathfrak{p}_i \\\\cap T is a chain of length m and then, in T/(\\\\mathfrak{p}_1 \\\\cap T), it becomes a chain of length m-1. Since \\\\operatorname{dim} T/(\\\\mathfrak{p}_1 \\\\cap T) \\\\le \\\\operatorname{dim} T/(u), we have m - 1 \\\\le d - 1. Hence, \\\\dim S \\\\le d.  Refinement  The following refinement appears in Eisenbud's book, which builds on Nagata's idea: Geometrically speaking, the last part of the theorem says that for X = \\\\operatorname{Spec} A \\\\subset \\\\mathbf{A}^m any general linear projection \\\\mathbf{A}^m \\\\to \\\\mathbf{A}^d induces a finite morphism X \\\\to \\\\mathbf{A}^d (cf. the lede); besides Eisenbud, see also .  Illustrative application : generic freeness  The proof of generic freeness (the statement later) illustrates a typical yet nontrivial application of the normalization lemma. The generic freeness says: let A, B be rings such that A is a Noetherian integral domain and suppose there is a ring homomorphism A \\\\to B that exhibits B as a finitely generated algebra over A. Then there is some 0 e g \\\\in A such that B[g^{-1}] is a free A[g^{-1}]-module. Let F be the fraction field of A. We argue by induction on the Krull dimension of F \\\\otimes_A B. The basic case is when the Krull dimension is -\\\\infty; i.e., F \\\\otimes_A B = 0. This is to say there is some 0 e g \\\\in A such that g B = 0 and so B[g^{-1}] is free as an A[g^{-1}]-module. For the inductive step, note F \\\\otimes_A B is a finitely generated F-algebra. Hence, by the Noether normalization lemma, F \\\\otimes_A B contains algebraically independent elements x_1, \\\\dots, x_d such that F \\\\otimes_A B is finite over the polynomial ring F[x_1, \\\\dots, x_d]. Multiplying each x_i by elements of A, we can assume x_i are in B. We now consider: :A' := A[x_1, \\\\dots, x_d] \\\\to B. It need not be the case that B is finite over A'. But that will be the case after invertible one element, as follows. If b is an element of B, then, as an element of F \\\\otimes_A B, it is integral over F[x_1, \\\\dots, x_d]; i.e., b^n + a_1 b^{n-1} + \\\\dots + a_n = 0 for some a_i in F[x_1, \\\\dots, x_d]. Thus, some 0 e g \\\\in A kills all the denominators of the coefficients of a_i and so b is integral over A'[g^{-1}]. Choosing some finitely many generators of B as an A'-algebra and applying this observation to each generator, we find some 0 e g \\\\in A such that B[g^{-1}] is integral (thus finite) over A'[g^{-1}]. Replace B, A by B[g^{-1}], A[g^{-1}] and then we can assume B is finite over A' := A[x_1, \\\\dots, x_d]. To finish, consider a finite filtration B = B_0 \\\\supset B_1 \\\\supset B_2 \\\\supset \\\\cdots \\\\supset B_r by A'-submodules such that B_i / B_{i+1} \\\\simeq A'/\\\\mathfrak{p}_i for prime ideals \\\\mathfrak{p}_i (such a filtration exists by the theory of associated primes). For each i, if \\\\mathfrak{p}_i e 0, by inductive hypothesis, we can choose some g_i e 0 in A such that A'/\\\\mathfrak{p}_i[g_i^{-1}] is free as an A[g_i^{-1}]-module, while A' is a polynomial ring and thus free. Hence, with g = g_0 \\\\cdots g_r, B[g^{-1}] is a free module over A[g^{-1}]. \\\\square  Notes  References * *.

The Federation covers various Young Farmers' Clubs (YFCs) throughout England and Wales, helping support young people in agriculture and the countryside. It does not include YFCs from Scotland or Ireland. History The first Young Farmers' Club opened in 1921 in Hemyock, Devon, where the United Dairies milk factory set children of the area's milk producers the task of calf rearing, with competitions and prizes for those achieving the highest standards. Over the next decade more clubs opened to provide agricultural education, with the focus on the keeping of growing and living things including calves, pigs, poultry, bees and gardens. After the death of one of YFC's original founders and greatest inspirations, Lord Northcliffe, in 1922 the Ministry of Agriculture took on development of the organisation. But within six years it was proving difficult for it to offer the type of help needed by the members to organise the 50 clubs or offer guidance on the rural social role Young Farmers' Clubs were assuming. In 1929 the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) stepped in with the goal of developing YFC as a voluntary, self-governing and self-generating organisation. =1930s= The National Federation of Young Farmers' Clubs was formed in March 1932, with its head office in London. New clubs sprang up in Scotland, Northern Ireland and as far afield as Australia and New Zealand, and by the outbreak of the Second World War, the federation included 412 clubs and 22 county federations with a membership of 15,000 people. =1940s and 1950s= The war years marked a turning point for YFC with the development of agricultural classes and proficiency tests, but were also nearly disastrous as many YFC supporters and staff were drawn into the armed forces or war work. Some clubs announced they were closing until after the war and by the end of 1940 few people held much hope of reviving YFC. But the picture changed dramatically when the Board of Education (BoE) was empowered to give financial help to youth organisations including YFC. A joint advisory committee was formed between the BoE, Ministry of Agriculture and NFYFC. Though membership had dropped to just 7,000, YFC now had government help, and had undergone a wide change, educationally and socially. It had become obvious that YFC could provide a countryside youth service and also clear it couldn‚Äôt do so with its existing staff, so the advisory committee made possible the appointment of an organiser for each county as part of the NFYFC staff. Then, just as the organisers had been appointed in 1943, the Treasury decided grant aid from the national government could not be used to appoint staff working at county level and YFC members were committed to shouldering the financial responsibility. A resolution was passed at the national AGM in 1947 to devise a national scheme to encourage crafts and recognise and reward skills. It aimed to encourage YFCs to organise instruction on a wide range of subjects. This was developed throughout the 1950s and formally recognised as the National Proficiency Test Scheme. By the end of the decade 10,000 tests a year were being taken and many thousands more Young Farmers were taking classes. When the tests became a formal part of nationally recognised assessment schemes, uniform national standards became necessary, and as NFYFC did not have the necessary resources it gave up control of the scheme. =1960s and 1970s= Society's swiftly changing attitudes in the 1960s helped to produce YFC members who felt that as they were contributing to the cost of their organisation they had the right to make the decisions, and who realised the positive role YFC could play. The national office moved from London to Stoneleigh Park, Warwickshire, in 1968. YFC influence spread and its standing as a national youth organisation became better understood. New avenues opened and the horizons of members broadened as they looked at things that would give YFC a wider involvement. YFC worked hard in developing its international links and exchange programme and members were able to join the Council of European Young Agriculturalists (CEJA). =1980s and 1990s= As the federation celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 1982, membership was at record level. The HQ at Stoneleigh Park was enlarged to include space for a training centre and improved motorway connections with the Midlands allowed members and county staff to take advantage of the courses offered. The result was a large group of senior members eager to serve as officers and leaders and use their skills to widen the organisation's thinking. With great traditions and a successful past, YFC looked ahead to the next 50 years aiming to retain those traditions yet be flexible enough to attract young people who were becoming more sophisticated with each generation. It had found a way of neither becoming a single purpose organisation, nor a general youth organisation, of retaining its countryside and farming traditions and yet being sophisticated enough to appeal to a wide spectrum of young people. Throughout the golden years morale in clubs was good, members were keen to participate. They raised large amounts of money for local and national charities and provided labour and leadership for community projects. The Agricultural and Rural Affairs Committee became a very effective force. Conservation, land use and agribusiness programmes were devised and the establishment of farm business tenancies was much influenced by this group. YFC was encouraged by government, financial institutions, business and academia to continue its pioneering role and sponsorship and grants were made available to augment YFC's subscription income to finance developments. Many members have gone on to represent their communities and agriculture at the highest levels on district and county councils, as MPs, MEPs and within the realms of agri-politics both nationally and in Brussels, where John Lee (Devon) was elected president of CEJA. =2000s= The Foot and Mouth outbreak in 2001 affected the way the YFCs were able to function. Many members were affected and most clubs took the decision to close yet remained in contact to ensure peer support was there at this crucial time. Membership is steadily increasing and there is a significant increase in the number of junior members joining the organisation. NFYFC has been reviewing and evaluating its role within the rural youth and agricultural sectors, ensuring it is able to continue to meet the needs of today's members. Structure Their memberships comprise over 23,000 young people aged between 10 and 26 years. YFCs are run by members for members, unlike most other youth organisations. The YFCs are grouped into 51 federations based mainly on county boundaries. These are grouped further into six regional areas in England and Wales and together form the NFYFC. The Young Farmers' Clubs organisation involves people who live, work, or have an interest in the countryside who join together to form an \\"open\\" Young Farmers' Club, where they can pursue their interests through a self-directed programme of activities encompassing agriculture, sport, community volunteering, the environment and a full social programme. England and Wales are also home to a limited number of school-based farm units, which often operate \\"School\\" Young Farmers' Clubs. =County= Each club is affiliated to its County Federation; responsible for organising the County events and activities and administration of national activities. Federation areas: *Eastern England *East Midlands *Northern England *South East England *South West England *Wales *West Midlands =National= All Clubs and Counties are affiliated to the National Federation of Young Farmers' Clubs whose role is to help ensure that programmes of personal social education through activities which challenge the abilities and capabilities of its members.

It is part of the valley of Rossendale, an ancient royal hunting ground. The majority of surrounding land is farm and moor land and many walkers come to the area. It is part of the Rossendale and Darwen constituency, with Jake Berry having been the Member of Parliament since 2010. Historical aspects There are a number of English Heritage properties here. Crawshaw Hall is a Grade II* listed mansion built in 1831 by John Brooks, a well-known local calico printer and quarry owner. His son Sir Thomas Brooks was created a baronet in 1891 and the following year raised to the peerage as Baron Crawshaw. Sir Thomas was appointed High Sheriff of Lancashire for 1884‚Äì85. The property descended in the Brooks family until it was sold in 1976. It has been a medical centre and nursing home since 1987. The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) Meeting House in the village is one of the oldest in the world (it was built in 1716). The village has many historical aspects such as Victorian-style housing and huge chimneys from the early Victorian Era. There was also a large cotton and shoe making industry in the Victorian Era. Goodshaw Chapel was associated with the Larks of Dean. Life and tourism Friends Meeting House The village has a small primary school, (Crawshawbooth Primary School) located outside of the main village. The village has a few shops and eating places including a fish and chip shop, an Indian restaurant, a cottage bakery, Chinese takeaway, and an Italian restaurant. There is also a newsagents, a dry cleaner and a public library as well as an award-winning butchers. The main road consists of a number of Victorian houses. The towns of Rawtenstall and Burnley and the hamlet of Loveclough are nearby. Crawshawbooth was also home to the See Gallery who mounted regular exhibitions of local nationally and internationally known artists including, amongst others, Ray Lowry, Liam Spencer, Dave Pearson and John Hyatt.

DEHP is the most common member of the class of phthalates, which are used as plasticizers. It is the diester of phthalic acid and the branched-chain 2-ethylhexanol. This colorless viscous liquid is soluble in oil, but not in water. Production and use The 3 stereoisomers of DEHP Due to its suitable properties and the low cost, DEHP is widely used as a plasticizer in manufacturing of articles made of PVC. Plastics may contain 1% to 40% of DEHP. It is also used as a hydraulic fluid and as a dielectric fluid in capacitors. DEHP also finds use as a solvent in glowsticks. Approximately three billion kilograms are produced annually worldwide. Industrial production entails the reaction of phthalic anhydride with 2-ethylhexanol: :C6H4(CO)2O + 2 C8H17OH ‚Üí C6H4(CO2 C8H17)2 \\\\+ H2O 2-Ethylhexanol is chiral, and the resultant DEHP consists of a mixture of (R,R)-, (S,S)-, and (R,S)-isomers (left). PVC is used extensively in sewage pipe due to its low cost, chemical resistance, and ease of jointing. Phthalate plasticizers are essential for the utility of PVC, which is too brittle otherwise. Manufacturers of flexible PVC articles can choose among several alternative plasticizers offering similar technical properties as DEHP. These alternatives include other phthalates such as diisononyl phthalate (DINP), di-2-propyl heptyl phthalate (DPHP), diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP), and non- phthalates such as 1,2-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid diisononyl ester (DINCH), dioctyl terephthalate (DOTP), and citrate esters. Environmental exposure DEHP is a component of many household items, including tablecloths, floor tiles, shower curtains, garden hoses, rainwear, dolls, toys, shoes, medical tubing, furniture upholstery, and swimming pool liners. DEHP is an indoor air pollutant in homes and schools. Common exposures come from the use of DEHP as a fragrance carrier in cosmetics, personal care products, laundry detergents, colognes, scented candles, and air fresheners. The most common exposure to DEHP comes through food with an average consumption of 0.25 milligrams per day. It can also leach into a liquid that comes in contact with the plastic; it extracts faster into nonpolar solvents (e.g. oils and fats in foods packed in PVC). Fatty foods that are packaged in plastics that contain DEHP are more likely to have higher concentrations such as milk products, fish or seafood, and oils. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) therefore permits use of DEHP- containing packaging only for foods that primarily contain water. DEHP can leach into drinking water from discharges from rubber and chemical factories; The US EPA limits for DEHP in drinking water is 6 ppb. It is also commonly found in bottled water, but unlike tap water, the EPA does not regulate levels in bottled water. DEHP levels in some European samples of milk, were found at 2000 times higher than the EPA Safe Drinking Water limits (12,000 ppb). Levels of DEHP in some European cheeses and creams were even higher, up to 200,000 ppb, in 1994. Additionally, workers in factories that utilize DEHP in production experience greater exposure. The U.S. agency OSHA's limit for occupational exposure is 5 mg/m3 of air. =Use in medical devices= DEHP is the most common phthalate plasticizer in medical devices such as intravenous tubing and bags, IV catheters, nasogastric tubes, dialysis bags and tubing, blood bags and transfusion tubing, and air tubes. DEHP makes these plastics softer and more flexible and was first introduced in the 1940s in blood bags. For this reason, concern has been expressed about leachates of DEHP transported into the patient, especially for those requiring extensive infusions or those who are at the highest risk of developmental abnormalities, e.g. newborns in intensive care nursery settings, hemophiliacs, kidney dialysis patients, neonates, premature babies, lactating, and pregnant women. According to the European Commission Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER), exposure to DEHP may exceed the tolerable daily intake in some specific population groups, namely people exposed through medical procedures such as kidney dialysis. The American Academy of Pediatrics has advocated not to use medical devices that can leach DEHP into patients and, instead, to resort to DEHP-free alternatives. In July 2002, the U.S. FDA issued a Public Health Notification on DEHP, stating in part, \\"We recommend considering such alternatives when these high-risk procedures are to be performed on male neonates, pregnant women who are carrying male fetuses, and peripubertal males\\" noting that the alternatives were to look for non-DEHP exposure solutions;FDA Public Health Notification: PVC Devices Containing the Plasticizer DEHP, USFDA July 12, 2002 they mention a database of alternatives.Products for Hazard: DEHP , Sustainable Hospitals The CBC documentary The Disappearing Male raised concerns about sexual development in male fetal development, miscarriage), and as a cause of dramatically lower sperm counts in men.The Disappearing Male ‚Äì Sunday February 14, 2010 at 3 pm on CBC-TV, CBC A review article in 2010 in the Journal of Transfusion Medicine showed a consensus that the benefits of a lifesaving treatments with these devices far outweigh the risks of DEHP leaching out of these devices. Although more research is needed to develop alternatives to DEHP that gives the same benefits of being soft and flexible which are required for most medical procedures. If a procedure requires one of these devices and if patient is at high risk to suffer from DEHP then a DEHP alternative should be considered if medically safe. =Metabolism= DEHP hydrolyzes to mono-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) and subsequently to phthalate salts. The released alcohol is susceptible to oxidation to the aldehyde and carboxylic acid. Effects on living organisms =Toxicity= The acute toxicity of DEHP is low in animal models: 30 g/kg in rats (oral) and 24 g/kg in rabbits (dermal). Concerns instead focus on its potential as an endocrine disruptor. =Endocrine disruption= DEHP, along with other phthalates, is believed to cause endocrine disruption in males, through its action as an androgen antagonist, and may have lasting effects on reproductive function, for both childhood and adult exposures. Prenatal phthalate exposure has been shown to be associated with lower levels of reproductive function in adolescent males. In another study, airborne concentrations of DEHP at a PVC pellet plant were significantly associated with a reduction in sperm motility and chromatin DNA integrity. Additionally, the authors noted the daily intake estimates for DEHP were comparable to the general population, indicating a ‚Äúhigh percentage of men are exposed to levels of DEHP that may affect sperm motility and chromatin DNA integrity‚Äù. =Development= Numerous studies of DEHP have shown changes in sexual function and development in mice and rats. DEHP exposure during pregnancy has been shown to disrupt placental growth and development in mice, resulting in higher rates of low birthweight, premature birth, and fetal loss. In a separate study, exposure of neonatal mice to DEHP through lactation caused hypertrophy of the adrenal glands and higher levels of anxiety during puberty. In another study, pubertal administration of higher-dose DEHP delayed puberty in rats, reduced testosterone production, and inhibited androgen- dependent development; low doses showed no effect. =Obesity= When DEHP is ingested intestinal lipases convert it to MEHP, which then is absorbed. MEHP is suspected to have an obesogenic effect. Rodent studies and human studies have shown DEHP to be a possible disruptor of thyroid function, which plays a key role in energy balance and metabolism. Exposure to DEHP has been associated with lower plasma thyroxine levels and decreased uptake of iodine in thyroid follicular cells. Previous studies have shown that slight changes in thyroxine levels can have dramatic effects on resting energy expenditure, similar to that of patients with hypothyroidism, which has been shown to cause increased weight gain in those study populations. =Cardiotoxicity= Even at relatively low doses of DEHP, cardiovascular reactivity was significantly affected in mice. A clinically relevant dose and duration of exposure to DEHP has been shown to have a significant impact on the behavior of cardiac cells in culture. This includes an uncoupling effect that leads to irregular rhythms in vitro. Untreated cells had fast conduction velocity, along with homogenous activation wave fronts and synchronized beating. Cells treated with DEHP exhibited fractured wave fronts with slow propagation speeds. This is observed in conjunction with a significant decrease in the amount of expression and instability of gap junctional connexin proteins, specifically connexin-43, in cardiomyocytes treated with DEHP. The decrease in expression and instability of connexin-43 may be due to the down regulation of tubulin and kinesin genes, and the alteration of microtubule structure, caused by DEHP; all of which are responsible for the transport of protein products. Also, DEHP caused down regulation of several growth factors, such as angiotensinogen, transforming growth factor-beta, vascular endothelial growth factor C and A, and endothelial-1. The DEHP-induced down regulation of these growth factors may also contribute to the reduced expression and instability of connexin-43. DEHP has also been shown, in vitro using cardiac muscle cells, to cause activation of PPAR-alpha gene, which is a key regulator in lipid metabolism and peroxisome proliferation; both of which can be involved in atherosclerosis and hyperlipidemia, which are precursors of cardio vascular disease. = Other health effects = Studies in mice have shown other adverse health effects due to DEHP exposure. Ingestion of 0.01% DEHP caused damage to the blood-testis barrier as well as induction of experimental autoimmune orchitis. There is also a correlation between DEHP plasma levels in women and endometriosis. DEHP is also a possible cancer causing agent in humans, although human studies remain inconclusive, due to the exposure of multiple elements and limited research. In vitro and rodent studies indicate that DEHP is involved in many molecular events, including increased cell proliferation, decreased apoptosis, oxidative damage, and selective clonal expansion of the initiated cells; all of which take place in multiple sites of the human body. Government and industry response =Taiwan= In October 2009, Consumers‚Äô Foundation, Chinese Taipei (CFCT) published test results that found 5 out of the sampled 12 shoes contained over 0.1% of phthalate plasticizer content, including DEHP, which exceeds the government‚Äôs Toy Safety Standard (CNS 4797). CFCT recommend that users should first wear socks to avoid direct skin contact. In May 2011, the illegal use of the plasticizer DEHP in clouding agents for use in food and beverages has been reported in Taiwan.FOOD SCARE WIDENS:Tainted additives used for two decades: manufacturer, Taipei Times, May 29, 2011 An inspection of products initially discovered the presence of plasticizers. As more products were tested, inspectors found more manufacturers using DEHP and DINP. The Department of Health confirmed that contaminated food and beverages had been exported to other countries and regions, which reveals the widespread prevalence of toxic plasticizers. =European Union= Concerns about chemicals ingested by children when chewing plastic toys prompted the European Commission to order a temporary ban on phthalates in 1999, the decision of which is based on an opinion by the Commission‚Äôs Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment (CSTEE). A proposal to make the ban permanent was tabled. Until 2004, EU banned the use of DEHP along with several other phthalates (DBP, BBP, DINP, DIDP and DNOP) in toys for young children. In 2005, the Council and the Parliament compromised to propose a ban on three types of phthalates (DINP, DIDP, and DNOP) ‚Äúin toys and childcare articles which can be placed in the mouth by children‚Äù. Therefore, more products than initially planned will thus be affected by the directive. In 2008, six substances were considered to be of very high concern (SVHCs) and added to the Candidate List including musk xylene, MDA, HBCDD, DEHP, BBP, and DBP. In 2011, those six substances have been listed for Authorization in Annex XIV of REACH by Regulation (EU) No 143/2011.http://www.intertek.com/uploadedFiles/Intertek/Divisions/Consumer_Goods/Media/PDFs/Sparkles/2011/sparkle559.pdf According to the regulation, phthalates including DEHP, BBP and DBP will be banned from February 2015. In 2012, Danish Environment Minister Ida Auken announced the ban of DEHP, DBP, DIBP and BBP, pushing Denmark ahead of the European Union which has already started a process of phasing out phthalates. However, it was postponed by two years and would take effect in 2015 and not in December 2013, which was the initial plan. The reason is that the four phthalates are far more common than expected and that producers cannot phase out phthalates as fast as the Ministry of Environment requested.http://www.dehp- facts.com/module/news/display/newsdisplay.aspx?news=45 In 2012, France became the first country in the EU to ban the use of DEHP in pediatrics, neonatal, and maternity wards in hospitals.http://healthierhospitals.org/media- center/news-updates/france-first-eu-country-ban-use-dehp-paediatrics- neonatology-and-maternity DEHP has now been classified as a Category 1B reprotoxin,https://echa.europa.eu/information-on-chemicals/cl-inventory- database/-/discli/details/10536 and is now on the Annex XIV of the European Union‚Äôs REACH legislation. DEHP has been phased out in Europe under REACH and can only be used in specific cases if an authorization has been granted. Authorizations are granted by the European Commission, after obtaining the opinion of the Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC) and the Committee for Socio-economic Analysis (SEAC) of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). = California = DEHP is classified as a ‚Äúchemical known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm‚Äù (in this case, both) under the terms of Proposition 65.https://oehha.ca.gov/proposition-65/chemicals/di2-ethylhexylphthalate-dehp References Further reading * External links *FDA Public Health Notification: PVC devices containing the plasticizer DEHP (archived page) *ATSDR ToxFAQs *CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards *National Pollutant Inventory - DEHP fact sheet *Healthcare without Harm - PVC and DEHP accessed 25 March 2014 *Healthcare without Harm: \\"Weight of the Evidence on DEHP: Exposures are a Cause for Concern, Especially During Medical Care\\"; 6p-fact sheet, 16 March 2009 accessed 25 March 2014 *Spectrum Laboratories Fact Sheet (archived page) *ChemSub Online : Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate -DEHP Category:Ester solvents Category:IARC Group 2B carcinogens Category:Phthalates Category:Endocrine disruptors Category:Plasticizers ","title":"Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate"},{"id":"3003616","text":"A Freedom Toaster is a public kiosk that will burn copies of free software onto user-provided CDs and DVDs.  History  Freedom Toaster in AberystwythThe original Freedom Toaster project was sponsored by Mark Shuttleworth's Shuttleworth Foundation and built in Perl by Hamish Whittal. It consisted of a number of CD burning facilities (in kiosk form), where members of the public were able to burn copies of free and open-source software onto self-supplied blank CD media. The project was started as one solution to overcome the difficulty of obtaining Linux and other free and open-source software in South Africa, where the restrictive telecommunications environment makes downloading large software files prohibitively expensive. There are currently Freedom Toasters at the following locations: Aberystwyth University, Bloemfontein, Cape Town (2), Diepkloof, Durban, East London, Grahamstown, Johannesburg (5), Knysna, Namibia, Pietermaritzburg, Port Elizabeth, Port Shepstone, Potchefstroom, Pretoria (3), Seneca College in Toronto,http://cdot.senecac.on.ca/projects/toaster/ Stellenbosch, Stockholm, Trivandrum.https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu- in/2008-September/003690.html Soon, it will be available at Michigan City, Indiana.  Functions  A Freedom Toaster kiosk is placed at a school, library, shopping center or another publicly accessible location. Users bring blank optical discs to the kiosk and select the software that they would like. The kiosk will then burn the selected software onto the users' media. The name derives from this function. \\"Freedom\\" refers to the free and open source software provided. \\"Toaster\\" is a term for an optical disc burner.  Purpose  Freedom Toaster kiosks provide a way for computer users in economically disadvantaged regions and areas with limited or no Internet access to get software.

The basic premise of the film comes from the blood type personality theory, which claims that a person's blood type can determine their personality traits. The heroine is type A (conservative and introverted) while her love interest is type B (passionate and irresponsible). Plot Lee Dong-gun portrays title character Young-bin, a handsome but obnoxious young man who begins the film by breaking off a relationship in a most impolite way: after waiting in a parked car so Young-bin won't get a ticket, the girlfriend reads him the riot act upon his return, prompting Young-bin to slip into the driver's seat, break up with her, and speed off, leaving his new ex-girlfriend stranded in the parking lot. From the get-go, Young-bin is not exactly a class act. On the opposite side of the spectrum is the beautiful Ha-mi (Han Ji-hye), a meek university student looking for true love, but never seeming to find it. As is typical in this kind of film, the two meet purely by chance: Ha-mi accidentally text messages Young-bin before literally bumping into him. Ha-mi, feeling that their fortuitous meeting is a sign that they might be destined for one another, decides to pal around with Young-bin and see if there's any chemistry between them. Taken by Ha-mi's sincerity and her willingness to pick up the check, Young-bin jumps at the opportunity. But Ha-mi's cousin, Chae-young (Shin Yi) isn't quite so enraptured with Young-bin and tries to dissuade Ha-mi from pursuing him. The thing is, Chae-young is a professional dating consultant and a strong subscriber to blood type personality theory. According to her, any relationship between the mismatched duo would be doomed to failure because Young-bin is a type-B male, which supposedly makes him arrogant, hardheaded, and generally a jerk, whereas Ha-mi is a type-A female, one who supposedly can't help being timid and obedient. But while Chae-young predicts impending doom, the happy couple try to give love a shot, ignoring their supposed blood type incompatibility.  Cast  * Lee Dong-gun as Young-bin, a callous type B young man, who is secretly experiencing financial trouble. * Han Ji-hye as Ha-mi, a mild-mannered type A college student who is searching for true love. * Shin Yi as Chae-young, Han-i's cousin and professional dating consultant. She warns Ha-mi against dating a type B man.

GiST is a generalization of the B+ tree, providing a concurrent and recoverable height- balanced search tree infrastructure without making any assumptions about the type of data being stored, or the queries being serviced. GiST can be used to easily implement a range of well-known indexes, including B+ trees, R-trees, hB-trees, RD-trees, and many others; it also allows for easy development of specialized indexes for new data types. It cannot be used directly to implement non-height-balanced trees such as quad trees or prefix trees (tries), though like prefix trees it does support compression, including lossy compression. GiST can be used for any data type that can be naturally ordered into a hierarchy of supersets. Not only is it extensible in terms of data type support and tree layout, it allows the extension writer to support any query predicates that they choose. GiST is an example of software extensibility in the context of database systems: it allows the easy evolution of a database system to support new tree-based indexes. It achieves this by factoring out its core system infrastructure from a narrow API that is sufficient to capture the application-specific aspects of a wide variety of index designs. The GiST infrastructure code manages the layout of the index pages on disk, the algorithms for searching indexes and deleting from indexes, and complex transactional details such as page-level locking for high concurrency and write-ahead logging for crash recovery. This allows authors of new tree-based indexes to focus on implementing the novel features of the new index type -- for example, the way in which subsets of the data should be described for search -- without becoming experts in database system internals. Although originally designed for answering Boolean selection queries, GiST can also support nearest-neighbor search, and various forms of statistical approximation over large data sets.  Implementations  The most widely used GiST implementation is in the PostgreSQL relational database; it was also implemented in the Informix Universal Server, and as a standalone library, libgist. = PostgreSQL = The PostgreSQL GiST implementation includes support for variable length keys, composite keys, concurrency control and recovery; these features are inherited by all GiST extensions. There are several contributed modules developed using GiST and distributed with PostgreSQL. For example: * rtree_gist, btree_gist - GiST implementation of R-tree and B-tree * intarray - index support for one-dimensional array of int4's * tsearch2 - a searchable (full text) data type with indexed access * ltree - data types, indexed access methods and queries for data organized as a tree-like structures * hstore - a storage for (key,value) data * cube - data type, representing multidimensional cubes The PostgreSQL GiST implementation provides the indexing support for the PostGIS (geographic information system) and the BioPostgres bioinformatics system.

He is best known as the frontman and principal songwriter of the rock band Arctic Monkeys, with whom he has released six albums. He has also recorded with his side project The Last Shadow Puppets and as a solo artist. When Turner was 16, he and three friends formed Arctic Monkeys in their native Sheffield. Their debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006), became the fastest-selling debut album in British history and was ranked at No. 30 on Rolling Stone list of the greatest debut albums of all time. The band's subsequent studio albums, Favourite Worst Nightmare (2007), Humbug (2009), Suck It and See (2011), AM (2013) and Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino (2018), have experimented with desert rock, indie pop, R&B;, and lounge music. Arctic Monkeys headlined Glastonbury Festival in both 2007 and 2013, and performed during the 2012 London Summer Olympics opening ceremony. As the co-frontmen of The Last Shadow Puppets, Turner and Miles Kane have released two orchestral pop albums: The Age Of The Understatement (2008) and Everything You've Come To Expect (2016). Turner also provided an acoustic soundtrack for the feature film Submarine (2010), and co-wrote and co-produced Alexandra Savior's debut album Belladonna of Sadness (2017). Turner's lyricism, ranging from kitchen sink realism to surrealist wordplay, has been widely praised. Each of his eight studio albums have topped the UK Album Chart. He has won seven Brit Awards, an Ivor Novello Award, and a Mercury Prize (having been nominated five times). Biography =Early life= Alexander David Turner was born in Sheffield on 6 January 1986, the only child of secondary school teachers Penny (n√©e Druce) and David Turner. He was raised in Sheffield's High Green suburb. He has said that his parents came from \\"very different backgrounds\\"; his mother, from Amersham, Buckinghamshire, taught German and was \\"fascinated by language\\". His father, a Sheffield native, taught music and physics. Turner's parents were both music fans and his earliest musical memories involve The Beatles and The Beach Boys. During car journeys, his mother played music by Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, and The Eagles. His father was a fan of jazz and swing music, particularly Frank Sinatra. He had played the saxophone, trumpet, and piano in big bands. Turner himself was taught some scales on the family keyboard by his father and took professional piano lessons until he was eight years old. From the age of five, Turner grew up alongside neighbour Matt Helders; they attended primary school, secondary school, and college together. At their primary school graduation ceremony, Turner and Helders joined some other friends in a mimed performance of Oasis' \\"Morning Glory\\"Helders played the role of Liam Gallagher while Turner pretended to play the bass guitar, using a tennis racket as his instrument. The two met Andy Nicholson in secondary school, and the three friends bonded over their shared enjoyment of rappers such as Dr. Dre, the Wu- Tang Clan, Outkast, and Roots Manuva. They spent their time playing basketball, skateboarding, riding BMXs, and \\"making crap hip-hop\\" beats using Turner's father's Cubase system. Turner and his friends became interested in rock music following the breakthrough of The Strokes in 2001. His father let him borrow a school guitar to learn a \\"couple of chords\\" when Turner was 15 and, for Christmas that year, his parents bought him an electric guitar. Turner was educated at Stocksbridge High School from 1997 to 2002. His form teacher, Mark Coleman, characterised him as a \\"bright\\" and \\"popular\\" student who excelled at sports rather than music. His English and drama teacher, Simon Baker, remembered him as a clever pupil who was \\"quite reserved\\" and \\"a little bit different\\". He noted that Turner had an \\"incredibly laid-back\\" approach to his studies, which worried his mother and led to criticism from other teachers. While there were books at home, Turner did not read regularly and was too self-conscious to share his writing with others. Nonetheless, he enjoyed English lessons. Turner then attended Barnsley College from 2002 to 2004. Given the opportunity to \\"get away without doing maths\\", he largely opted out of the \\"substantial\\" subjects required for university entry. He studied for A-levels in music technology and media studies, as well as AS- levels in English, photography, and psychology. =2002‚Äì2004: Formation of Arctic Monkeys= At the age of 15, Turner's weekends revolved around girls and drinking cider with his friends. Joe Carnall, a schoolfriend, has said Turner was \\"always the quiet one\\" in their social circle. After friends began forming bands and playing live, Turner, Helders, and Nicholson decided to start Arctic Monkeys in mid-2002. According to Nicholson, Turner already had \\"instruments about the house\\" and was conversant in the basics of musicianship because of his father's job as a music teacher. Helders bought a drum kit, while Turner suggested that Nicholson learn bass guitar, and invited Jamie Cook, a neighbour who attended a different school, to play guitar. Initially, Turner played guitar in the instrumental band; he became the frontman when two other school friends declined to sing. Helders considered Turner the obvious candidate for lyricist ‚Äì \\"I knew he had a thing for words\\" ‚Äì and he gradually began to share songs with his bandmates. Before playing a live show, the band rehearsed for a year in Turner's garage and, later, at an unused warehouse in Wath. According to Helders' mother, who drove the teenagers to and from their rehearsal space three times a week: \\"If they knew you were there, they would just stop so we had to sneak in.\\" Their first gig was on Friday, 13 June 2003, supporting The Sound at a local pub called The Grapes. The set, which was partly recorded, comprised four original songs and four cover versions of songs by The Beatles, The White Stripes, The Undertones, and The Datsuns. In the summer of 2003, Turner played seven gigs in York and Liverpool as a rhythm guitarist for the funk band Judan Suki, after meeting the lead singer Jon McClure on a bus. That August, while recording a demo with Judan Suki at Sheffield's 2fly Studios, Turner asked Alan Smyth if he would produce an Arctic Monkeys demo. Smyth obliged and \\"thought they definitely had something special going on. I told Alex off for singing in an American voice at that first session.\\" An introduction by Smyth led to the band acquiring a management team, Geoff Barradale and Ian McAndrew. They paid for Smyth and Arctic Monkeys to record numerous three-song demos in 2003 and 2004. Turner was quiet and observant during studio sessions, remembered Smyth: \\"Whenever anyone popped in the studio, he would sit and listen to them before he would say anything.\\" At their rehearsal room in Yellow Arch Studios, Arctic Monkeys developed a reputation as particularly hard workers; the owner lent the band touring equipment while the owner's wife helped Turner with his singing. Barradale drove the band around venues in Scotland, the Midlands, and the north of England to establish their reputation as a live band. The band handed out free copies of the demo CDs after each show and fans began sharing the unofficial Beneath the Boardwalk demo compilation online. After finishing college in mid-2004, Turner took a year out to focus on the band and deferred vague plans to attend university in Manchester. He began working part-time as a bartender at the Sheffield music venue The Boardwalk. There, he met well- known figures including musician Richard Hawley and poet John Cooper Clarke. By the end of 2004, Arctic Monkeys' audiences were beginning to sing along with their songs and the demo of \\"I Bet You Look Good on The Dancefloor\\" was played on BBC Radio 1 by Zane Lowe. =2005‚Äì2007: Rise to fame= Turner performing in Newcastle Academy, 2006 Arctic Monkeys came to national attention in early 2005. They received their first mention in a national newspaper in April, with a Daily Star reporter describing them as \\"the most exciting band to emerge this year\\". They self-released an EP, featuring the single \\"Fake Tales of San Francisco\\", in May and commenced their first nationwide tour soon afterwards. In June, in the midst of a bidding war, Arctic Monkeys signed to the independent label Domino Recording Company. After initial sessions with James Ford and Mike Crossey, they recorded an album in rural Lincolnshire with producer Jim Abbiss. Turner began dating London-based student Johanna Bennett around this time. In October, the single \\"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\\" debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart. Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, Arctic Monkeys' debut album, was released in January 2006, and debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart. Turner's lyrics, chronicling teenage nightlife in Sheffield, were widely praised. Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times remarked: \\"Mr. Turner's lyrics are worth waiting for and often worth memorizing, too ... He has an uncanny way of evoking Northern English youth culture while neither romanticizing it nor sneering at it.\\" Musically, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted that the album was influenced by guitar bands \\"from the past five years ... Thrillingly, their music doesn't sound apologetic for not knowing the intricacies of rock history.\\" It was the fastest-selling debut album in British music history and quickly became a cultural phenomenon. Turner was hailed by British press outlets as \\"the voice of a generation\\". In interview profiles, however, he was described as quiet and uncomfortable with attention. The band dismissed the hype, with Cook saying their goal was \\"to be able to grow like The Clash. When they started, it was a very basic, punky record. Then they started to take off and move in lots of directions. That‚Äôs what we want.\\" Less than two months after the album's release, Turner declared that Sheffield-inspired songwriting was \\"a closed book\\": \\"We're moving on and thinking about different things.\\" Years later, Turner said that the attention during this period made him \\"a bit frightened or nervous\\": \\"We shut a lot of people out, just to try to keep some sort of control.\\" The band turned down many promotional opportunities and quickly released new material ‚Äì a five- track EP Who the Fuck Are Arctic Monkeys? in April, and a stand-alone single, \\"Leave Before the Lights Come On\\", in August. That summer, the band made the decision to permanently replace Nicholson, who had taken a touring break due to \\"fatigue\\", with Nick O'Malley, another childhood friend. Nicholson was informed at a band meeting, during which \\"Al did the speaking.\\" Turner and Nicholson stopped speaking for two years but later repaired their friendship. Coachella in May 2007 Arctic Monkeys' second album, Favourite Worst Nightmare, was released in April 2007, just over a year after their debut. It was produced in London by Mike Crossey and James Ford. As of 2020, Ford has produced every subsequent Turner project. Lyrically, the album touches on fame, love, and heartache. Turner and Bennett had ended their relationship in January; she was credited as a co-writer on \\"Fluorescent Adolescent\\". While uninterested in the songs concerning fame, Marc Hogan of Pitchfork said the album displayed Turner's \\"usual gift for vivid imagery\\" and explored \\"new emotional depth\\". Petridis of The Guardian noted that the band were \\"pushing gently but confidently at the boundaries of their sound\\", with hints of \\"woozy psychedelia\\" and \\"piledriving metal\\". The album was a commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while Arctic Monkeys headlined Glastonbury Festival in the summer of 2007. Also that year, Turner began to collaborate with other artists. He worked with rapper Dizzee Rascal on the Arctic Monkeys B-side \\"Temptation\\", a version of which also featured on Rascal's album Maths and English. He co-wrote three songs on Reverend and The Makers' debut album The State Of Things, after briefly sharing a Sheffield flat with the frontman Jon McClure. Another Sheffield singer, Richard Hawley, featured on the Arctic Monkeys' B-side \\"Bad Woman\\" and performed with the band at the Manchester Apollo, as part of a concert film directed by Richard Ayoade. Turner also announced plans to form a side-project band, The Last Shadow Puppets, with Ford and Miles Kane, whom he had befriended during a tour in mid-2005. =2008‚Äì2011: Musical experimentation= Turner performing with The Last Shadow Puppets in 2008 The Last Shadow Puppets' debut album, The Age of the Understatement, was released in April 2008, shortly after Turner had moved from Sheffield to east London. Co-written by Turner and Kane, the album was recorded in the Loire Valley, France and featured string arrangements by Owen Pallett. Alexa Chung, dating Turner since mid-2007, featured in the music video for \\"My Mistakes Were Made For You\\". Hogan of Pitchfork noted that, lyrically, Turner was \\"moving from his anthropologically detailed Arctics brushstrokes to bold, cinematic gestures.\\" Petridis of The Guardian detected \\"the audible enthusiasm of an artist broadening his scope\\" and praised \\"a certain fearlessness on display\\". During a tour with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, Turner said Kane's presence gave him \\"somewhere to hide\\" on stage. The Last Shadow Puppets gave a surprise performance at Glastonbury Festival, with both Matt Helders and Jack White making guest appearances. Alison Mosshart performed with the band at the Olympia in Paris, and provided vocals for a B-side. Also in 2008, Turner formed a covers band with Dev Hynes for a one-off show in London and recorded a spoken word track \\"A Choice of Three\\" for Helders' compilation album Late Night Tales. Turner has described Arctic Monkeys' third album, Humbug, released in August 2009, as \\"a massive turning point\\" in the band's career. They travelled to Joshua Tree, California to work with producer Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age; it was the band's first experience of working in a studio for extended period of time. Homme has said the album's heavier sound was initiated by the band themselves, while he encouraged Turner to embrace longer guitar solos and to develop his newfound \\"crooning\\" style of singing. While Petridis of The Guardian found some lyrics \\"too oblique to connect\\", he was impressed by the band's \\"desire to progress\\". He described \\"Cornerstone\\" as a \\"dazzling display of what Turner can do: a fabulously witty, poignant evocation of lost love.\\" Joe Tangari of Pitchfork felt the album was a \\"legitimate expansion of the band's songwriting arsenal\\" and described \\"Cornerstone\\" as the highlight. During a break in the UK Humbug tour, Turner joined Richard Hawley on stage at a London charity concert, and played a seven-song acoustic set. Homme joined Arctic Monkeys for a live performance in Pioneertown, California. While living in Brooklyn, New York, where he moved with Chung in the spring of 2009, Turner wrote an acoustic soundtrack for the coming-of-age feature film Submarine (2010); it was released as an EP in March 2011. Director Richard Ayoade initially approached Turner to sing cover versions but, instead, he recorded six original songs in London, accompanied by James Ford and Bill Ryder-Jones. Two of the songs had already been written; Turner wrote the rest after watching dailies from the film set. The songs existed within the world of the film as a mixtape made by the main character's father. Paul Thompson of Pitchfork felt \\"Turner's keen wit and eye for detail\\" had created a \\"tender portrayal\\" of adolescent uncertainty. Ben Walsh of The Independent said the \\"exquisite\\" soundtrack was \\"reminiscent\\" of Cat Stevens's work on Harold and Maude. In 2014, the Submarine soundtrack appeared on The Times's list of 100 Soundtracks to Love. Turner also co-wrote six songs for Miles Kane's debut solo album Colour of the Trap (2011) and co-wrote Kane's standalone single \\"First of My Kind\\" (2012). Turner wrote Arctic Monkeys' fourth album, Suck It and See, in New York and met up with his bandmates and James Ford for recording sessions in Los Angeles. Marc Hogan of Pitchfork enjoyed the album's \\"chiming indie pop balladry\\" and \\"muscular glam-rock\\". Petridis of The Guardian remarked that Turner's new lyrical style of \\"dense, Dylanesque wordplay is tough to get right. More often than not, he pulls it off. There are beautifully turned phrases and piercing observation.\\" Richard Hawley co-wrote and provided vocals for the B-side, \\"You and I\\", and performed the song with the band at the Olympia in Paris. Turner joined Elvis Costello on stage in New York to sing \\"Lipstick Vogue\\". =2012‚Äì2017: International success= By 2012, Arctic Monkeys were based in Los Angeles, with Turner and Helders sharing a house. Arctic Monkeys toured the US as the support act for The Black Keys in early 2012. While they had previously opened for Oasis and Queens of the Stone Age at one-off shows, it was the band's first time to tour as a supporting act. They released \\"R U Mine?\\" as a standalone single in preparation for the tour, with Turner's new girlfriend, Arielle Vandenberg, appearing in the music video. Later that year, Arctic Monkeys performed \\"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\\" and a cover of \\"Come Together\\" by The Beatles at the 2012 London Summer Olympics opening ceremony. In early 2013, Turner provided backing vocals for the Queens of the Stone Age song \\"If I Had a Tail\\" and played bass guitar on \\"Get Right\\", a Miles Kane B-side. Arctic Monkeys headlined Glastonbury Festival for a second time in June. alt= AM was released in September 2013. Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork said that the album, dealing with \\"desperate 3 a.m. thoughts\\", managed to modernise \\"T. Rex bop, Bee Gees backup vocals, Rolling Stones R&B;, and Black Sabbath monster riffage\\". Phil Mongredien of The Guardian described it as \\"their most coherent, most satisfying album since their debut\\": \\"Turner proves he has not lost his knack for an insightful lyric.\\" Arctic Monkeys promoted the album heavily in the US, in contrast to previous album campaigns where, according to Helders, they had refused to do radio promotion: \\"We couldn‚Äôt even have told you why at the time. Just stubborn teenage thinking.\\" Arctic Monkeys spent 18 months touring AM; they were joined onstage by Josh Homme in both Los Angeles and Austin. Turner briefly reunited with Chung in the summer of 2014, having ended his two-year relationship with Vandenberg earlier that year. Columbia Records approached Turner about working with Alexandra Savior in 2014, and he co-wrote her debut album, Belladonna of Sadness, in between Arctic Monkeys' touring commitments. Turner and James Ford co-produced the album in 2015, with Turner also playing bass, guitars, keyboards, and synthesisers. An additional song \\"Risk\\" was recorded with T Bone Burnett for an episode of the crime drama True Detective. While Turner and Savior performed together in Los Angeles in 2016, the album was not released until April 2017. In reviewing it, Hilary Hughes of Pitchfork remarked: \\"Turner‚Äôs musical ticks are so distinct that they‚Äôre instantly recognizable when someone else tries to dress them up as their own.\\" Savior later said the press attention surrounding Turner's involvement was overwhelming: \\"I'm so grateful for him, but I'm also like, 'Alright, alright!'\\" The Last Shadow Puppets released their second album, Everything You've Come to Expect, in April 2016. Turner, Kane and Ford were joined by Zach Dawes of Mini Mansions, with whom Turner had collaborated on the songs \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"I Love You All The Time\\" in 2015. Owen Pallett again composed the string arrangements, this time working in the studio with the band rather than remotely. According to Turner, the album featured \\"the most straight-up love letters\\" of his career, written for American model Taylor Bagley whom he dated from 2016 to 2018.MOJO June 2018, page 79, Andrew Cottirill Laura Snapes of Pitchfork detected an air of \\"misanthropy\\" in the album. However, she acknowledged that Turner was \\"no less a gifted lyricist than ever\\" and described some songs as \\"totally gorgeous ... the structures fluid and surprising\\". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian enjoyed Turner's \\"characteristically sparkling use of language\\" and \\"melodic skill\\". However, he felt the pair's \\"in-joking\\" during interviews and Kane's \\"leery\\" encounter with a female Spin journalist sullied the album. From March until August 2016, they toured in Europe and North America. Johnny Marr played guitar with the band at two shows, while Turner's father David played saxophone at a Berlin show. =2018 onward: Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino= Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino, Arctic Monkeys' sixth album, was released in May 2018. After receiving a Steinway Vertegrand piano as a 30th birthday present from his manager, Turner wrote the space-themed album from the perspective of \\"a lounge-y character\\". He recorded demos at home, alone and later with Helders, and shared them with Cook in early 2017. Cook was initially taken-aback by the change in direction but was \\"very, very excited by what he‚Äôd come up with.\\" By mid‚Äì2017, the whole band was recording the project, produced by Turner and James Ford, in both Los Angeles and France. They were joined by musicians from the bands Tame Impala, Klaxons, and Mini Mansions. Upon release, Jonah Weiner of Rolling Stone characterised Tranquility Base as \\"a captivatingly bizarre album about the role of entertainment ‚Äì the desire to escape into it, and the desire to create it ‚Äì during periods of societal upheaval and crisis.\\" Alexis Petridis of The Guardian found it \\"quietly impressive\\" that the band chose to release the \\"thrilling, smug, clever and oddly cold album\\" rather than more crowd-pleasing fare. Jazz Monroe of Pitchfork declared it \\"a delirious and artful satire directed at the foundations of modern society.\\" The album became the eighth number one album of Turner's career in the UK. The band toured the album from May 2018 to April 2019. Turner began dating French singer Louise Verneuil in mid‚Äì2018. Artistry =Influences= Turner performing at the 240x240px Turner was \\"into hip-hop in a big way\\" as a teenager. When he first started writing lyrics, Roots Manuva's Run Come Save Me was his main influence. He also listened to Rawkus Records and Lyricist Lounge compilations, and artists such as Dr Dre, Snoop Dogg, OutKast, Eminem and The Streets. He has repeatedly cited Method Man as one of his favourite lyricists, and has referenced the Wu-Tang Clan in his own lyrics. For Turner, The Strokes were \\"that one band that comes along when you are 14 or 15 years old that manages to hit you in just the right way and changes your whole perception of things.\\" He changed his style of dress and began to take an interest in guitar music. He has since referenced the band in his lyrics. The Vines were the first band Turner ever saw live and Craig Nicholls provided inspiration for his early stage persona. Other early guitar influences included The Libertines, The Coral, The Hives and The White Stripes. In his late teens, Turner began \\"delving\\" into older music and discovered lyricists including Elvis Costello, Ray Davies of The Kinks, Jarvis Cocker of Pulp, Paul Weller of The Jam, and Morrissey of The Smiths. Turner has since performed with Jack White of The White Stripes, Costello and Johnny Marr of The Smiths. John Cooper Clarke, whose poetry Turner first encountered at school, was a \\"massive\\" source of early inspiration. Turner was working as a barman at The Boardwalk in Sheffield in late 2004 when Clarke appeared on stage as the opening act for The Fall. The performance made a big impression on the eighteen-year-old: \\"He's talking 100 miles an hour, and he's really funny ... It just blew my mind.\\" He was inspired by Clarke's use of a regional accent and the early Arctic Monkeys song \\"From the Ritz to the Rubble\\" was his homage to Clarke's style (\\"my best shot at it, at least\\"). Later in his career, Turner requested to interview Clarke for Mojo Magazine, published two Clarke poems as part of a single's artwork and used another (\\"I Wanna Be Yours\\") as the lyrical basis for a song. In 2018, Arctic Monkeys invited Clarke to perform his reading of \\"I Wanna Be Yours\\" at one of their Sheffield arena shows. Nick Lowe, Jake Thackray, Nick Cave, John Cale, Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan and Lou Reed are among the lyricists Turner admires. He has spoken of his respect for country music songwriters like Roger Miller, Willie Nelson, Townes Van Zandt, and Hank Williams. He has been drawn to artists who reinvented themselves throughout their careers: \\"The Beatles, David Bowie‚Ä¶ the big ones.\\" When forming The Last Shadow Puppets in 2007, Turner was inspired by the music of Bowie, Scott Walker, Serge Gainsbourg, David Axelrod and Ennio Morricone. Songs that Turner has discussed repeatedly in interviews are Michael Chapman's \\"You Say\\", Leon Russell's \\"A Song for You\\" and Dion's \\"Only You Know\\", describing the latter as \\"one of my favourite tunes of all time\\". In 2007, he told Q Magazine that he is a huge Beyonc√© Knowles fan. =Songwriting= Kate Mossman of the New Statesman described Turner as \\"one of the great lyricists of the 21st century\\", writing that his songs are \\"full of lovingly extended metaphors\\" and \\"mordant Morrissey-style observations\\". Mike Laws of the Village Voice characterised him as \\"a writer without peer in virtually all of rock\\" and identified \\"rapid-fire prosody and facility with internal rhyme\\" as Turner's trademarks. Simon Armitage, writing in The Guardian, said: \\"Of all those writing lyrics today, Turner is among the most poetic. His use of internal rhyme exists to be admired and envied ... Turner is a storyteller and scene-setter.\\" \\"Like all the estimable British lyricists, be it No√´l Coward or Morrissey, Turner has always been willing to risk a delicious irony or witty turn of phrase, even in a sad song.\\" Kitty Empire of The Observer considers him \\"probably the finest lyricist of his generation.\\" Turner's early songs chronicled teenage nightlife in England, and, according to Armitage, were \\"of the kitchen-sink, social-realism variety.\\" Sasha Frere- Jones of the New Yorker described him as \\"a prodigy at both character sketches and song form.\\" Turner drew comparisons to Alan Bennett and Victoria Wood. As Turner has aged, Laws of the Village Voice noted: \\"His lyrics have shied away from making themselves amenable to easy reading. [They have become] more oblique and abstruse ‚Äî more apt, too, to adopt the perspective of somebody else entirely, and so more editorially unreliable.\\" Turner himself acknowledges that, after writing \\"so directly\\" on his early songs, he went through a period of \\"wanting to reject that and, you know‚Ä¶ just be the walrus for a bit.\\" He first \\"attempted to write lyrics that weren‚Äôt so observational\\" with his side-project The Last Shadow Puppets, later remarking that he had sometimes veered too far \\"into abstraction\\". He considers the lyrics on 2018's Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino to be the most direct since his earliest songs: \\"I think that was something I was trying to get away from, and perhaps I‚Äôve returned to it now.\\" Turner has said his songs are preoccupied with romance, loneliness, and longing. Jazz Monroe of Drowned in Sound remarked: \\"Turner seems part of an elite club of songwriters whose best love songs are the requited ones.\\" Similarly, in reviewing 2013's AM, Mossman found the depiction of romantic partners \\"two-dimensional. In \\"Fluorescent Adolescent\\", or the memorably titled \\"Mardy Bum\\", he somehow managed to tell a girl's side of the story even in the act of mocking her.\\" Neil McCormick of The Telegraph noted \\"a particularly North of England, working-class quality of sarcastic misanthropy\\" in Turner's lyrics while Frere-Jones of the New Yorker said Turner \\"manages to summon the intractable bleakness of someone three times his age\\". Later songs have alluded to \\"questions of consumerism, hyper-reality, [and] accelerating technology\\". Monroe of The Independent highlights \\"anti- industry sloganeering,\\" \\"lyrical abstraction,\\" \\"postmodern scepticism,\\" and a \\"rejection of the entire rock construct\\" as the \\"through-line in Turner's work.\\" Turner himself says that his songwriting is \\"absolutely not\\" poetry: \\"Poetry and the written word are harder, you've no melodies to hide behind.\\" After initial reluctance, he began publishing his lyrics with Arctic Monkeys' fourth album. In an in-depth conversation about songcraft with New York's Lane Brown, he said: \\"I don‚Äôt really get the ‚ÄòI wrote the whole song on the back of a cigarette packet in 20 minutes‚Äô sort of thing ... I would keep adding or changing words forever if somebody didn't stop me.\\" Turner has said writing melodies is the more difficult part of the songwriting process for him. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian believes \\"Turner‚Äôs melodic skill sometimes gets overlooked\\" because he \\"arrived in the public consciousness words-first.\\" =Voice= In the early years of his career, Turner performed in a strong Sheffield dialect. Simon Armitage remarked: \\"I can't think of another singer whose regional identity has been so unapologetically and naturally intoned through his singing voice.\\" By 2018's Tranquility Base Hotel, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted: \\"The Yorkshire dialect that was once his USP is now deployed sparingly, as a jolting effect.\\" One critic claimed that the tone of Turner's voice has also transformed over time, from a \\"fidgety whine\\" to \\"a worn-in baritone croon\\". =Stage persona= In an otherwise positive review of a 2006 show, Richard Cromelin of the Los Angeles Times noted that Turner seemed \\"a little spooked by the attention\\" and hoped he would learn \\"to reach out more to the audience\\" in time. In 2007, Kitty Empire of The Observer noted that he was a \\"reserved\\" presence on stage: \\"He chats a bit to about 15 people in the middle of the front rows, and only looks up at the balcony, once, a little apprehensively.\\" Following Arctic Monkeys' headlining appearance at Glastonbury Festival in 2007, Rosie Swash of The Guardian remarked upon Turner's \\"steady, wry stage presence\\": \\"Arctic Monkeys don't do ad-libbing, they don't do crowd interaction, and they don't do encores.\\" Simon Price of The Independent said Turner seemed \\"to freeze like a rabbit in the spotlights\\" during a headlining set at Reading Festival in 2009. In late 2011, Turner began to change his stage persona and style, most notably changing his hairstyle to a \\"rockabilly-inspired quiff\\". Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone noted of his \\"newfound showmanship\\" that he \\"puts his guitar down to strut and dance, drops to his knees for solos when he does play, [and] flirts shamelessly with the female fans\\". In reviewing a 2013 concert, Dorian Lynskey of The Guardian said, \\"Turner, a shy sort for a frontman, used to seem unnerved by attention and he's coped by adopting a tongue-in-cheek persona that suggests a comic-strip version of a 50s rock star, a Blackpool Buddy Holly: all quiff and quips. It's a curious pose, entertaining but alienating in the same way as some of his more arch lyrics. [...] Turner always holds something back, which makes the band more interesting but somewhat distant.\\" Ben Beaumont-Thomas of The Guardian noted in 2018 that Turner ironically \\"played with the role\\" of being a rockstar but simultaneously \\"can't help but be a real rock star\\". Turner has described public speaking as almost being his \\"worst nightmare\\" and does not consider himself a \\"born performer\\", stating that he \\"enjoy[s] the studio side of it more than touring\\". Although an admitted \\"control freak\\" by nature, he describes being a frontman as an \\"awkward\\" and \\"strange\\" experience that he does not \\"take too seriously\\". He said, \\"I can't go out there and absolutely be myself. The situation is so fundamentally unnatural. [...] It's not a full-on, 'right, get into character' thing ... [sometimes] part of how you actually feel comes out. But I think I always feel weird about that afterwards.\\" Discography Solo * Submarine (2011) Arctic Monkeys * Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006) * Favourite Worst Nightmare (2007) * Humbug (2009) * Suck It and See (2011) * AM (2013) * Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino (2018) The Last Shadow Puppets * The Age Of The Understatement (2008) * Everything You've Come To Expect (2016) Other collaborations * 2007 ‚Äì Reverend and The Makers ‚Äì The State of Things (writer and vocalist on \\"The Machine\\", co-writer of \\"He Said He Loved Me\\" and \\"Armchair Detective\\") * 2007 ‚Äì Dizzee Rascal ‚Äì Maths + English (\\"Temptation\\") * 2008 ‚Äì Matt Helders ‚Äì Late Night Tales: Matt Helders (\\"A Choice of Three\\") * 2011 ‚Äì Miles Kane ‚Äì Colour of the Trap (co-writer of \\"Rearrange\\", \\"Counting Down the Days\\", \\"Happenstance\\", \\"Telepathy\\", \\"Better Left Invisible\\" and \\"Colour of the Trap\\") * 2012 ‚Äì Miles Kane ‚Äì First of My Kind EP (co-writer of \\"First of My Kind\\") * 2013 ‚Äì Miles Kane ‚Äì Don't Forget Who You Are (co-writer and bassist on B-side \\"Get Right\\") * 2013 ‚Äì Queens of the Stone Age ‚Äì ...Like Clockwork (guest vocalist on \\"If I Had a Tail\\") * 2015 ‚Äì Mini Mansions ‚Äì The Great Pretenders (co-writer and guest vocalist on \\"Vertigo\\", co-writer on \\"Valet\\") * 2015 ‚Äì Alexandra Savior ‚Äì True Detective season 2 original soundtrack (co-composed song \\"Risk\\" on guitar, keyboard, drums) * 2017 ‚Äì Alexandra Savior ‚Äì Belladonna of Sadness (co-writer, co-producer, bass, guitar, keyboards, and synthesizers) References External links * Arcticmonkeys.com Category:1986 births Category:21st-century English singers Category:Alternative rock guitarists Category:Alternative rock singers Category:Arctic Monkeys members Category:British indie rock musicians Category:Domino Recording Company artists Category:English tenors Category:English expatriates in the United States Category:English rock guitarists Category:English rock singers Category:English singer-songwriters Category:Ivor Novello Award winners Category:NME Awards winners Category:Lead guitarists Category:Living people Category:Musicians from Sheffield Category:English male guitarists Category:The Last Shadow Puppets members ","title":"Alex Turner"},{"id":"3003688","text":"Dog plate and conventional plate Unusual slotted faceplate A lathe faceplate is a basic workholding accessory for a wood or metal turning lathe. It is a circular metal (usually cast iron) plate which fixes to the end of the lathe spindle. The workpiece is then clamped to the faceplate, typically using t-nuts in slots in the faceplate, or less commonly threaded holes in the faceplate itself. The faceplate may be attached to the lathe in several ways: the two most common are a thread and a precision cone arrangement, and threaded studs and a circular recess fitting a flange on the end of the spindle. Increasingly common is the camlock arrangement, in which shaped studs and cams replace threaded studs for rapid exchanging of the faceplate with other accessories, such as three or four jaw chucks. The faceplate was the ancestor of lathe chucks, an arrangement of three or more adjustable 'dogs' bolted to the faceplate providing a primitive chuck arrangement. The smaller plate in the upper photo is specifically a 'dog face' with slots intended to hold a bent tail dog while the work itself was supported on centers. The larger plate to the right simply provides a variety of ways by which work can be bolted or clamped to the plate. The slotted plate on the lower photo accepts wedged holders which can be used to fasten the work to the plate. The plates were expendable, so it was not unusual as shown in both photos for a machinist to drill additional holes in the plates for attaching work that could not otherwise be attached. While the dog plates were usually fairly small regardless of the lathe size, the classic face plate is usually matched to the maximum diameter that the lathe will swing. It may seem that a faceplate is a primitive accessory superseded by precision chucks, but its inherent flexibility (almost any shape can be attached to a faceplate with care and the right fixings) and the possibility of achieving great accuracy by careful setup make it essential for a well equipped lathe. For certain specialist jobs, temporary or special faceplates can be made, perhaps in wood or light alloy, that can be machined or adapted for difficult workholding jobs. One example might be attaching thin sheet metal to a wooden faceplate using wood screws, allowing the trepanning of holes, with the tool cutting into the sacrificial faceplate material.

It has been published by Gorilla Comics (an Image Comics imprint), DC Comics, and a partnership between Thrillbent and IDW Publishing. The protagonist of the series is a Doctor Doom-like supervillain named Golgoth who has defeated all superheroes and conquered the world, but who must now contend with internal power struggles. Publication history The series was originally published in 2000 by Gorilla Comics, a company formed by Mark Waid, Kurt Busiek and several others, but the company folded after only two issues were produced. Empire was finished at DC Comics in 2003‚Äì2004, although it remains in its own fictional universe and is not part of the DC Universe. The already published two comic books were collected in a #0 and then the rest of the story was told over six issues. In April, 2014 it was reported that the rights to the series had reverted to Waid and Kitson and the series would return under Waid's Thrillbent comics platform.Waid's Thrillbent Launches an App; Revives \\"Empire\\" Plot Characters *Golgoth ‚Äì the Emperor of the world. He is human and at the beginning of the series it is revealed that his wife is dead but his daughter is still alive. He is ruthless and ensures the loyalty of his Ministers through the use of a highly addictive booster drug called Eucharist. His powers seemingly come from his armour; he is never in the series seen without his mask. His powers include hand blasts and teleportation, a technology that greatly helped him in his fight against the world. *Delfi ‚Äì Golgoth's daughter resides in the Empire's citadel and is treated by the Emperor and its people as a secluded princess. Golgoth keeps his business and ruthlessness secret from her and she seemingly knows nothing about his real actions. She spends the majority of her day studying or reading books that are recommended to her by the Emperor. However, the girl reveals herself to be not as innocent as first suspected as the series progresses. *Xanna ‚Äì Minister of Execution. She is the Emperor's chief assassin but, being bored with her position (because the Emperor has killed most of his enemies), she chooses to ponder the origins of the Eucharist drug. *Tumbril ‚Äì Minister of Discipline. The Emperor's chief Torturer who uses all manners of acquiring information from the enemies of the Empire. *Lohkyn ‚Äì The newly appointed Minister of Espionage and is the character whose point of view the reader sees through much of the series. He develops a secret sexual relationship with Delfi. *Lucullan ‚Äì The Minister of War. He is known for frequently fumbling his words. He first met Golgoth in Australia 10 years prior to the events of issue 0. *Kafra ‚Äì Head of the Ministry of Information. Kafra has been modified and bound to his workstation for the purpose of co-ordinating and editing the news of the world to best represent the intentions and goals of the Empire. *Sebirus ‚Äì the Emperor's Domestic Advisor and an old friend of the Emperor. He knew the Emperor's wife before she died, and is close to Delfi. Due to his friendship and loyalty to the Emperor, he believes that he is the only indispensable member of the cabinet. *Endymion ‚Äì A superhero and Golgoth's greatest opponent.

He was also the founder of Seattle's counterculture troupe Ze Whiz Kidz. During the later part of his life he focused on painting. Early life Tomata du Plenty was born as David Xavier Harrigan on May 28, 1948, in the state of New York, of Irish immigrant parents. His family moved to Montebello, California, when he was 9 years old, and Tomata ran away to Hollywood at the age of 15. In 1968 he hitchhiked to San Francisco, California, where he met members of the Cockettes, including Hibiscus. He appeared in one of the early shows of The Cockettes but soon moved to Seattle, WA. where he formed his own theatre group, Ze Whiz Kidz. Early career Tomata led Ze Whiz Kids, a troupe based on Seattle, Washington that blended counterculture comedy with drag theater during 1969‚Äì1972. The group staged nearly a hundred musical revues with a cast that featured performers like Satin Sheets, Co Co Ritz, Dyna Flo, Benny Whiplash, Michael Hautepants (costume designer Michael Murphy), Leah Vigeah and biological women Valerie Allthetime DePonty (Valerie DePonty), Louise Lovely (Di Linge) and Cha Cha Samoa (Cha Davis, who died in 2019 after a long battle with cancer). In the Fall of 1973, Tomata and Cockette founding member, Fayette Hauser moved to New York City to bring guerrilla comedy to CBGB's and other East Village clubs, working with then-unknown bands like the Ramones and Blondie. \\"I used to do Pat Suzuki between their sets\\", he said. They were soon joined by fellow performers Gorilla Rose, Cockettes Sweet Pam Tent and John Flowers. In 1972 and 1973, Tomata and company staged two Palm Casino Revues at the Bouwerie Lane Theater. In between shows, he and Fayette found time to write a gossip column called \\"Hollywood Spit\\" for the Naked News, an adult newspaper and together Fayette and Tomata also operated a vintage store on Mott St. Their clientele included the sculptor Louise Nevelson. The store had no name. Also at this time Fayette and Tomata worked with Chris Stein and Joseph Freeman on a video magazine also called \\"Hollywood Spit\\" with fellow performers Gorilla Rose and John Flowers for Public Access television. The show aired in New York and in Los Angeles. Returning to Seattle in 1974, Tomata formed a band called The Tupperwares with Melba Toast (later Tommy Gear). The band re-formed in 1975, in Los Angeles. In 1976 they included drummer K. K. Barrett and keyboardist David Brown, and a new name, The Screamers. Brown was later replaced by Paul Roessler. As much theater as rock band, The Screamers eschewed guitars and featured two keyboards, one drummer and assaultive lyrics mostly written and sung by Tomata. Their sound anticipated the electronic rock of the early 1980s. Their look‚Äîfoot-high hair and ripped clothes‚Äîwas achieved with the help of hair sprays, gels and a full- time stylist (Chloe Pappas). Late career During 1977‚Äì1981 The Screamers were a notable L.A. punk band, and one of the city's leading club draws. They played consecutive sold-out performances at L.A.'s top music venues, including the Whisky a Go Go, the Starwood and the Roxy Theatre, but despite several offers never signed a record deal. The band's last performance, without keyboardist Gear, was at the Whisky a Go Go in 1981. Two years before MTV, it incorporated music video with live performances by Tomata, K.K., Paul Ambrose, Shari Penquin and the Fabulous Sheela. Much of the film was later used in a full-length feature, Population: 1, produced and directed by Dutch filmmaker Rene Daalder and featuring a cast of L.A. musicians and scene-makers, including a preschool Beck Hansen. Population: 1 was screened in 1986 at the Cannes International Film Festival and Seattle International Film Festival. In 1987 it was screened at the Chicago International Film Festival and was later released in Europe and Japan. In October 2008, Population: 1 was released on DVD in the United States and Canada. Tomata was a prolific stage producer, playwright and lyricist who wrote scores of songs, plays, sketches, and musicales. He was fond of quoting an old review by Rex Reed, \\"No talent is not enough,\\" but hundreds of avid fans disagreed. In 1985 he wrote and performed The Weird Live Show, a series of unconventional shows at the Anti-Club and LACE Gallery in Los Angeles. In the late 1980s he directed a series of short films with Los Angeles filmmaker Kevin Kierer, including Mr. Baby and Pick Up on Olivera Street featuring Styles Caldwell. He coaxed 50s TV horror-movie hostess Vampira out of retirement, and featured her in several performances and films. Tomata began his art career in 1983 with a one-man exhibit of watercolor portraits at the Zero One Gallery in Hollywood. Three years later, in 1986, his first paintings on canvas were exhibited at L.A.'s Cheap Racist Gallery at a show called Whores, Sluts and Tramps (at the opening party, guests appeared dressed as their favorite low-life heroes). In 1987, he won the L.A. Weekly's Best Set Design Award for his work on John Fleck's one-man stage show, I Got the He-Be She-Be's. He directed the Compulsive Players in a performance at L.A.'s MOCA that same year and exhibited at the Bye Bye Gallery with artist Diane Gamboa. An exhibit called \\"Knock Out!,\\" featuring portraits of boxers, appeared in 1988 at the Zero One Gallery in Los Angeles. That same year he was the regular art critic on the cable television series, What's Bubbling Underground, and he guest lectured at the Fashion Institute of Los Angeles. In one of his last stage performances he appeared in The Loves of Edgar Allan Poe with Gronk, Fayette Hauser, Janis Siegel of The Manhattan Transfer and Styles Caldwell at L.A.'s Casa Confetti. Tomata continued his painting career after moving to Miami's South Beach in 1989. His exhibits‚Äîin bars, restaurants, small galleries around the country and even laundromats‚Äîwere often arranged around a single theme, saluting his favorite poets, TV stars, country/western singers and boxers. Tomata painted people he admired, from historical figures to friends from the punk world, in a style that was emotional, provocative and accessible. He was proud of his status as an outsider artist; he once observed he would rather sell 100 pictures for $25 than one picture for $2,500. In the mid-1990s he moved his studio to New Orleans, Louisiana. Several times a year he would hit the road for exhibits in California, New York and Florida. In January 1999 he appeared in a CNN interview, along with series of paintings featuring Lucille Ball, Elvis Presley and other pop-culture icons. On August 21, 2000, while in San Francisco, Tomata died of cancer at the age of 52. His remains were cremated, and his ashes are interred at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, in a niche in the Chapel Columbarium. In 2012, noted scholar and art collector, Gordon W. Bailey, a champion of du Plenty's artistry, gifted a number of his superb portraits depicting boxers and entertainers to the Georgia Museum of Art in Athens, GA in honor of the founding members of R.E.M., Michael Stipe, Peter Buck, Mike Mills and Bill Berry. Bailey encouraged the museum to pay tribute to du Plenty and following his lead the museum organized the exhibition Boxers and Backbeats: Tomata du Plenty and the West Coast Punk Scene which ran from October 2014 until January 2015. The museum's pre-exhibition promotional efforts came to the attention of Carlos Iglesias, a founder of The Remainder Is Productions, and Helen Clarke. In the spring of 2014, Iglesias and Clarke, in close association with a number of du Plenty's friends and collaborators, staged the multi-media event Big Hair: The Life and Times of Tomata du Plenty at Art Share Los Angeles. In April 2014, The Remainder Is Productions, launched a Kickstarter Project which stated: \\"The goal is to bring Tomata's untold story to life. We've already begun shooting footage of the cast of characters essential to Tomata's story. As the research continues, we've realized what a challenging road lies ahead. This project will be one part detective case and one part treasure hunt. We will most likely need to travel to the various cities where Tomata left his artistic footprint, seek out the players, and find the stories. The people we have met with so far have been generous of time and heart. The interactions have felt somewhat symbiotic in our mutual desire to commemorate his spirit and legacy.\\" The documentary was apparently in pre-production as of 2018, however appears since to be stalled.

New technologies to be introduced include composite aerostructures, more electrical systems (reduction of hydraulic systems), and more fuel-efficient turbofan engines (such as the Pratt & Whitney PW1000G Geared Turbofan, General Electric GEnx, the CFM International CFM56, and the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000). The term \\"Yellowstone\\" refers to the technologies, while \\"Y1\\" through \\"Y3\\" refer to the actual aircraft. The first of these projects, Y2, has entered service as the Boeing 787. Yellowstone projects Yellowstone is divided into three projects: * Boeing Y1, to replace the Boeing 737, 757, and 767-200 product lines. The Y1 covers the 100- to 250-passenger market, and is expected to be the second Yellowstone Project aircraft to be developed. Boeing submitted a patent application in November 2009, that was released to the public in August 2010, that envisions an elliptical composite fuselage, and likely signals the company's planning for the 737 successor.\\"Weight-Optimizing Internally Pressurized Composite-Body Aircraft Fuselages Having Near-Elliptical Cross Sections\\". ip.com, August 12, 2010. In early 2011, Boeing outlined plans for a 737 replacement that would arrive in 2020. In August 2011, Boeing announced the 737 MAX, an updated and re-engined version of the 737 NG, rather than progress with Y1 concepts. In November 2014, it was reported that Boeing plans to develop a new aircraft to replace the 737 in the 2030 time frame. From 2015 onwards, it became clear that Boeing was focusing on a \\"New Midsize Airplane\\", a seven-abreast twin-aisle with an elliptical cross-section, expected to be launched in 2019 for entry into service in the mid-2020s. In January 2020, Boeing put these plans on hold and announced a clean-sheet reevaluation of the project. * Boeing Y2, to replace the 767-300 and -400 product lines. It may also replace the 777-200. It covers the 250- to 350-passenger market, and was the first completed Yellowstone project, coming to fruition as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Y2 initially referred to the highly efficient, more conventional, baseline aircraft for the Sonic Cruiser, which was project \\"Glacier\\". The Dreamliner competes with the Airbus A330, A340 and later A350 families. * Boeing Y3, to replace the 777-300 and 747 product lines. Y3 covers the 350‚Äì600+ passenger market, and is expected to be the third Yellowstone Project aircraft to be developed. It would compete with the Airbus A380 family as well as the largest model of the A350 family, the A350-1000. In June 2010 it was reported that Emirates, which has the largest fleet of 777s, was in discussions with Boeing about plans to develop a new airliner to replace the 777. The Boeing 777-8X and 777-9X, largely considered the end result of the Y3 program, were launched by Boeing on November 16, 2013 at the Dubai Airshow in the United Arab Emirates, with 259 orders.

John Nairne Lieutenant-Colonel John Nairne (1 March 1731 - 14 July 1802) was a Scottish- Canadian soldier and seigneur. Nairne came to Canada in 1758 as a lieutenant, and participated in the captures of Louisbourg and Quebec City. Given Nairne's lack of prospects back in Scotland, he decided to remain in Canada, and in 1762 he received, along with his friend Malcolm Fraser, the seigneury of La Malbaie, with Fraser taking Mount Murray and Nairne receiving Murray Bay and the town of La Malbaie. Nairne retired on half-pay as soon as he received his land. Devoting himself to his seigneury, Nairne had it surveyed, and brought some soldiers from the regiment with him to settle the land. Nairne hoped to establish a Protestant settlement on his lands, but found it impossible to bring a Protestant priest in with only five Protestant families living in his seigneury. Although Nairne turned out to be an excellent farmer, it was difficult to make much revenue off of his land, and many of his requests (such as asking for a road to be built) went unanswered. In 1769, Nairne married a fellow Scot, Christina Emery. With Christine, Nairne had four children, but by the time Nairne returned from a 1773 trip to Scotland, three of them had died. Eventually, he would have five more, and life in La Malbaie improved, with Nairne building a large manor house and working hard to promote his products. In 1775, with an American invasion imminent, Governor Guy Carleton charged Nairne with organizing a regiment from his seigneury and the surrounding communities. On 12 August, Nairne offered himself for any available Captaincy. He was appointed a Captain in the Royal Highland Emigrants the next month, a group largely composed of soldiers from Nairne's old regiment, the 78th Regiment of Foot. Nairne played a key role on the Loyalist side during the Siege of Quebec, although he was extremely reluctant to fight men who spoke the same language and had been raised as he had. This stage of his military career was to last eight years, with Nairne serving with distinction and eventually reaching the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the army. During his time with the army, Nairne fought at Montreal and √éle aux Noix, and also supervised the building of a fort and at Carleton Island. He also supervised the building of a jail at Murray Bay. Finally, in 1783, after his promotion to Lieutenant-Colonel, he sold his rank in the Royal Highland Emigrants, receiving 3000 pounds for it, and returned to Murray Bay, where he settled permanently. By the time of Nairne's death in 1802, his seigneury had more than 500 inhabitants and was prospering economically. Nairne had little to regret, although he deeply wished that his attempts to implant Protestantism had been successful. Still, he was on good terms with the Roman Catholic priest. His source of greatest sadness was the death of his son John in India. Although Nairne had many children, only one of his sons survived his death, Tom, who followed his father's foot-steps and joined the army. Tom Nairne was killed at Carleton Island in 1813, fighting at the fort his father had built.

Two symposia have been devoted to the codex, and their papers published: in Rende (Calabria) (1984) and in Cosenza (1988). The text, which bears the ambiguous title \\"On the origin of his body\\", recounts Mani's introduction to the Jewish- Christian Elkesaite baptising sect. Mani's teachings are revealed to him through his spiritual companion and celestial twin (his syzygos). The Greek text bears traces that shows it has been translated from an Eastern Aramaic or Old Syriac original. The logoi of Mani himself are repeatedly cited.

It is located west of Grass Valley, California, approximately 62 miles (100 km) from Sacramento. The population was 963 at the 2010 census. It has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names. History The first established settlement in Rough and Ready was made in the fall of 1849 by a mining company from Wisconsin, known as the Rough and Ready Company, during the California Gold Rush. Their leader, Captain A. A. Townsend, named the company after General Zachary Taylor (nicknamed \\"Old Rough and Ready\\") who had recently been elected the 12th President of the United States. Captain Townsend had served under Taylor when he commanded the American Forces during the Black Hawk War (1832). California had three towns so named of which this one survives. The town declared its secession from the Union as The Great Republic of Rough and Ready on 7 April 1850, largely to avoid mining taxes, but voted to rejoin the Union less than three months later on 4 July. The old republic is celebrated annually as a way to attract tourism. The post office at Rough and Ready was established by February 1851; the first postmaster was Marcus Nutting.Salley, Harold E. (1991) History of California Post Offices, 1849-1990, p. 183. The Depot, The ZIP Code is 95975. The community is inside area code 530. The post office was closed for a time in 1855, again for a time in 1913, and again from 1942 to 1948. Present day What little is left of the town is located on the Rough and Ready Highway. It was bypassed by State Route 20 in the mid-1980s. Among the oldest buildings are the blacksmith shop (1850s), the Odd Fellows Hall (1854), and the Old Toll House. The town of Rough and Ready is honored as a California Historical Landmark (#294). Popular culture The New York City-based music duo The Great Republic of Rough and Ready takes its name from the town. The syndicated western television series, Death Valley Days, told the story of Rough and Ready in two different episodes. In the 1957 episode \\"Rough and Ready,\\" the town secedes from the Union solely to expel a miner the townsmen accuse of sharp dealing. Rough and Ready returns to the United States the following 4 July. In this version, A.A. Townsend is played by Fred Coby and E. F. Brundage is played by Harry Fleer. In the 1965 episode \\"Birthright,\\" President Zachary Taylor levied a tax on California mines in California. Opponents declared \\"taxation without representation\\" and led by a prominent businessman named Brundage (R. G. Armstrong), decide to secede from the United States. Jason Evers was cast as Dan Hardy, who guides the community back into the federal Union.

Biography Tuilaepa was born in Lepa, Samoa. He attended high school at St Joseph's College in Lotopa and at St Paul's College, Auckland. He then obtained a master's from the University of Auckland, becoming the first Samoan to receive a master's degree in Commerce. He worked for the European Economic Community and Coopers & Lybrand before being elected to the Samoan parliament in 1980. Tuilaepa lost two relatives in the 2009 Samoa earthquake and tsunami, including the daughter of one of his nieces. Most of Malielegaoi's hometown of Lepa, Samoa, was destroyed in the tsunami, leaving just the church and the village's welcome sign standing. Political career Tuilaepa was the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance under Tofilau Eti Alesana following the Human Rights Protection Party's return to power after the coalition government of Va'ai Kolone and Tupua. For a while he was both Prime Minister and Minister of Finance after Tofialu stepped down from the Premiership. However, following a Cabinet reshuffle after the following elections of 2001 in which he led the HRPP for an additional term, Tuilaepa relinquished the post of Minister of Finance to Misa Telefoni Retzlaff who also became the new Deputy Prime Minister. The reason given for Tuilaepa's relinquishment of the Ministry of Finance was the amount of responsibility and work involved being both Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and to do the job properly required a full- time Minister. Tuilaepa has twice reassigned the Finance portfolio since that time. Tuilaepa first won election to represent his Lepa district in 1980, after the death of the previous representative. He has been re-elected for Lepa since that time. He served as finance minister in the Tofilau government of 1991 and 1996. In 1996, he was appointed deputy prime minister. In 1998, Tofilau retired from parliament (and hence the prime ministership) due to ill- health. Tuilaepa then became the 6th Prime Minister of Samoa. He has successfully led his HRPP party to re-election in the 2001, 2006, 2011, and 2016 general elections. In 2008 Tuilaepa became Samoa‚Äôs longest serving Prime Minister, surpassing that of his predecessor, Tofilau Eti Alesana. Policies = Opposition to Fiji's Bainimarama = Tuilaepa has emerged as one of Oceania's most vocal critics of Fijian interim leader Commodore Frank Bainimarama, who came to power in the 2006 Fijian coup d'√©tat. Tuilaepa has stated that Bainimarama has shown little respect for the opinions of regional Pacific leaders. Tuilaepa has said that Bainimarama's actions since the 2006 coup have shown that Bainimarama has no intentions of returning Fiji to democratic rule or holding transparent, free elections. Tuilaepa cites numerous actions by Bainimarama to back up his criticisms, including rescinding assurances to leaders at a regional meeting in Tonga that elections would be held in May 2008. He has also criticised Bainimarama as a \\"no-show\\" at regional meetings of the Pacific Islands Forum in Niue and Papua New Guinea. Tuileapa has said that Bainimarama's failure to compromise, hold democratic elections and meet with regional leaders is not the \\"Pacific way.\\" In a February 2009 continuation of the war of words between Bainimarama and Tuilaepa, Bainimarama accused Samoa's foreign policy of being dictated by New Zealand. He also accused Tuilaepa of being \\"un-Pacific\\". Tuilaepa fired back, questioning whether Bainimarama was sober when he made these claims and reiterating that Bainimarama shows little respect for Pacific leaders. = Regional Polynesian integration = In late 2011, Tuilaepa initiated a meeting of Polynesian leaders which led, in November, to the formal launching of the Polynesian Leaders Group, a regional grouping intended to co-operate on a variety of issues including culture and language, education, responses to climate change, and trade and investment. The Group was in part a response to the Melanesian Spearhead Group.Andrews, John. \\"NZ may be invited to join proposed ‚ÄòPolynesian Triangle‚Äô ginger group\\", Pacific Scoop, 19 September 2011 =Christianity= In June 2017, the Samoan Parliament passed a bill to increase support for Christianity in the country's constitution, including a reference to the Trinity. Article 1 of the Samoan Constitution states that ‚ÄúSamoa is a Christian nation founded of God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit‚Äù. According to The Diplomat, \\"What Samoa has done is shift references to Christianity into the body of the constitution, giving the text far more potential to be used in legal processes.\\" The preamble to the constitution already described the country as \\"an independent State based on Christian principles and Samoan custom and traditions.\\" Sporting aspirations Tuilaepa was founder of Apia West Rugby, and is currently chairman of the Samoa Rugby Union.From the PM to the CJ, they all played rugby for the Marist Sports Club ‚Äì Talamua, 27 October 2015 Tuilaepa competed for his country at the 2007 South Pacific Games in the sport of target archery. In participating in the Games, Tuilaepa became the first elected leader to represent his country at a multi-sport event. Having taken up the sport only five months prior to the Games, Tuilaepa was ranked second in Samoa in the combined bow discipline. Tuilaepa's son was also a reserve team member. On day 10 of the Games, Tuilaepa won a silver medal in the mixed recurve team play event.  Matai titles  Tuilaepa has the following Fa'amatai titles. * Tuilaepa * Lupesoliai * Neioti * Aiono * Fatialofa * Lolofie * Galumalemana (Vaitele) * AueluƒÅ Criticism =Traffic lane switch= Tuilaepa's government passed highly controversial legislation in 1998 to switch Samoan road use from right to left-hand traffic.\\"Samoa provokes fury by switching sides of the road\\", The Telegraph, 3 July 2009\\"Right-to-left driving switch upsets Samoans\\", ABC Radio Australia, 12 August 2008 The controversy resulted in a peaceful demonstration which drew more than 15,000 people the largest protest demonstration in Samoan history, and to the founding of the People's Party, a political party established to protest against changing sides.\\"People‚Äôs Party to elect leaders\\", Samoa Observer, 9 November 2008 =International Date Line shift= In 2011, Tuilaepa's government introduced a bill to shift Samoa west of the International Date Line, to facilitate economic relations with Australia, New Zealand and Asia (by ensuring that Samoa would no longer be one calendar day away from them). According to Samoa Observer editor Keni Lesa, many Samoans viewed the bill as \\"another crazy idea from our crazy prime minister\\". Opposition politicians also criticised it, arguing that it would not increase exports, and that it would in fact deprive Samoa of \\"its unique tourism selling point as the last place on earth to see the sun\\", just east of the Date Line. Tuilaepa responded by calling opposition MP Lealailepule Rimoni Aiafi (of the Tautua Samoa Party) \\"very stupid\\", adding that \\"only an idiot\\" would fail to see the merits of the bill. However, the bill had the support of the Samoa Chamber of Commerce and the vast majority of the private and finance sector. The major benefit being that, given that most trade was conducted with New Zealand and Australia, and a growing trade sector with South East and East Asia, that being on the same day as these major trading partners would lead to improvements in productivity, as more trade could be facilitated during a shared five-day week, as opposed to the previous situation of only sharing three-week days to conduct business. =Measles outbreak= A measles outbreak began in September 2019. As of 26 December, there were 5,612 confirmed cases of measles and 81 deaths, out of a Samoan population of 200,874. Over two percent of the population has been infected. The outbreak has been attributed to a sharp drop in measles vaccination from the previous year. In 2013, 90% of babies in Samoa received the measles-mumps-rubella vaccination at one year of age. On 6 July 2018 on the east coast of Savai'i, two 12-month-old children died after receiving MMR vaccinations. The cause of death was incorrect preparation of the vaccine by two nurses who mixed vaccine powder with expired anaesthetic instead of the appropriate diluent. These two deaths were picked up by anti-vaccine groups and used to incite fear towards vaccination on social media. The government stopped its vaccination programme for 10 months, despite advice from the WHO. The incident caused many Samoan residents to lose trust in the healthcare system. Nevertheless, as of 29 December a public inquiry into the government's role in suspending vaccinations had not been announced. Deputy director of health Gaualofa Matalavea Saaga stated, \\"Having our case blasted out to the world is the last thing we want.\\" Samoa‚Äôs political opposition called for the health minister to be removed from his position. Assassination attempts Tuilaepa has been the target of three plots to kill him; one of those being almost successful when in 1999, Eletise Leafa Vitale, tried to kill him but instead one of Tuilaepa 's Cabinet Ministers was murdered. In December 2010, another plot was uncovered by Samoan police and, in August 2019, authorities foiled a detailed plan to assassinate him.

His nickname was \\"The General\\". Mimis Domazos is considered by many to be one of the best footballers that Greece has ever produced. He was famed for his very good dribbling ability, his creative passes, especially long passes of pinpoint accuracy, and his leadership. He was Panathinaikos FC team captain for over 15 years. When he retired from playing, in 1980, Domazos was declared the longest-active footballer in the history of Greek football, having played for more than 21 years. Career Domazos was born on 22 January 1942 in Ambelokipi, Athens, just a few blocks away from the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium and began his playing career at the age of thirteen with a neighborhood team, Amyna Ampelokipon, whose field was across the street from the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium. Panathinaikos scouted his talent and offered him a professional contract. Domazos did not pass up the chance to play for his favourite team and in 1959 (when the first Greek National Championship took place) Panathinaikos signed him at the age of 17. He went on to become a living legend for Greek football and Panathinaikos. He played for Panathinaikos at 1971 European Cup Final. In 1979, after 20 years in Panathinaikos and due to an argument with his coach, he transferred to AEK for one year. He returned to Panathinaikos in 1980 when the new team president, Yiorgos Vardinogiannis, asked him to end his illustrious career in the team that loved him so much. Career statistics =International= *His first match with the national team was on 2 December 1959 against Denmark in Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium (Greece lost 1‚Äì3) and his last was on 11 November 1980 against Australia in the same field (3‚Äì3) *He was the National team captain during these years.

Ufton Court is an Elizabethan manor house at Ufton Nervet in the English county of Berkshire. Today it is an active home to an educational charity, the Ufton Court Educational Trust. As well as historical and environmental education, the site hosts creative projects including theatre and music courses. It is also a wedding and corporate events venue. Architecture Parts of the house date from 1474, including the basis of the great hall and the screens passage complete with the original 'pantry and buttery' doors, although, at Ufton, there was a proper kitchen beyond. From 1568, the place was modified and extended by Elizabeth, Lady Marvyn, a prominent Roman Catholic, including the installation of a magnificent pendant ceiling in the great hall. Two carved beams which she had installed in the Green Room are thought to be older and may have been brought from her former residence nearby. The house is notable for its priest holes where Recusant Catholics could hide priests, their vestments and plate used in the mass. An east wing and Catholic devotional panelling were added in 1616. Further embellishments, including updated panelling, were added in the early 18th century. History  =Late medieval times= The house was originally a small medieval manor called Ufton Pole and was one of the minor manors belonging to Lord Lovell. He was made a Viscount by Edward IV and later became part of Richard III's inner circle. With the death of King Richard in 1485, Lovell rebelled against the new king, Henry VII and had all his lands, including Ufton Pole, confiscated by the Crown. =Tudor and Stuart times= In 1510, Henry VIII granted Pole Manor to Sir Richard Weston, a Groom of the Chamber. In 1568, the house was bought by Lady Marvyn, the widow of Richard Perkins of Ufton Robert Manor at Ufton Green. She considerably altered and enlarged the house over the next eight years and renamed it 'Ufton Court'. She eventually left the house to her first husband's nephew, Francis Perkins. It remained in this family until 1769. The Perkins were persecuted for their Catholic beliefs. They had to pay fines for not attending Church of England services at the parish church and could be subjected to raids at any time by local magistrates looking for priests, hidden in tiny secret rooms. In 1599, during the second raid on Ufton, Sir Francis Knollys discovered at least one priest hole containing much gold plate, but the priests were not in residence. =Georgian times= In 1715, Francis Perkins of Ufton Court married Arabella Fermor, the daughter of Henry Fermor of Tusmore in Oxfordshire. Before the marriage, painters and poets celebrated her charms and her beauty, for she was the belle of London society. She is remembered today as the inspiration for Alexander Pope's 'The Rape of the Lock,' a poem telling how Lord Petre stole a lock of her hair and caused a great scandal. Arabella was humiliated and accepted Perkins' offer of marriage in order to live quietly in the country instead. Tradition asserts that the great hall and western half of Ufton Court were refashioned for the lady's arrival, and this seems to fit with the date of the architecture and interior d√©cor there. Bonnie Prince Charlie is supposed to have secretly visited the couple during the Jacobite rising of 1745. They had six children together, but they all died childless and the house gradually fell into a state of disrepair. =Victorian times= Floor plan During its sale in 1837, Ufton Court was described as 'unfit for a gentleman's residence.' It was bought by Richard Benyon De Beauvoir of the adjoining estate at Englefield. He repaired the house and converted it into tenements for his estate workers. Over the next hundred years, various tenants lived in the house: mostly notably Mary Sharp, a local historian who wrote a detailed history of the place. Mr (later Sir) Henry Benyon also lived there himself before inheriting Englefield House, restoring the house as a gentleman's residence once more and replanting the garden. Educational Centre Although still owned by the Benyons, Ufton Court is now the home of the Ufton Court Educational Trust. This charity provides opportunities for children and young people to explore the historical and environmental world through hands-on experiences. They host both day visits and residential courses. Many of the rooms are now dormitories and children are encouraged to treat the house as their own. Historical courses range from studies of the Iron Age to the Victorian era. The site includes a Tudor garden and small Saxon/Medieval/Tudor farm with pigs, goats and chickens to look after. In the grounds are a 'Celtic Village,' featuring a reconstructed Iron Age roundhouse, a 'Wheel of the Year' fire circle, a Roman/Saxon palisade and Saxon/Viking ship; as well as the 'Ufton Adventure' woodland centre based around residential cabin accommodation. The Ufton Dole The Ufton Dole is a distribution of bread and sheets, from a window in the Great Hall of Ufton Court, every Maundy Thursday to the villagers of Ufton Nervet and Padworth. Lady Marvyn left money in her will of 1581 for this annual dole. Tradition has it that this was to thank the villagers for having helped her return home after becoming lost in the local woods. Additionally, a curse is said to have been placed on any lord of the manor who breaks the tradition. The distribution is currently undertaken by Richard Benyon MP.

It consisted of approximately 600 members. Its duties included counter-terrorism, riot control, search and rescue, and demolition. In some respect its duties were reminiscent of the British SAS. After 1991 the unit was abolished due to its controversial role and association with the Communist government of Albania, and its members were dispersed into subsequent special operations units such as RENEA, ROS, Shqiponjat, and the Commando Brigade. History Unit 326 was activated on 22 January 1982 as Battalion 326Ish-kreu i RENEA-s: Akti i Enver Hoxh√´s p√´r themelimin e ‚Äúspecial√´ve‚Äù m√´ 1981 in an anti-riot role under the all-powerful Ministry of Interior. The first batch of recruits came from a variety of military and law enforcements units such as the army, National Guard, National Police and Navy divers. In the period 1982-1990 the unit was mostly employed in security measures in sport stadiums, which due to the degeneration of the political and economic situation in Albania were considered as potential hubs of mass movements of insurrection. In this period the unit came only twice in armed conflict. The first time was in September, 1982 when a band of three Albanian expatriates \\\\- named Haznedari and Mustafa, and an unidentified resident of New Zealand - reputedly joined with rightwing political exiles and decided to challenge the Communist dictatorship. Haznedari, owner of a commercial laundry in Rome and banned from the U.S. for several years on political grounds, and the New Zealander were reputedly undercover Communist Albanian intelligence officers, who had left Albania in the late 1940s to spy on their fellow nationals living in exile. Mustafa, also an immigrant from Albania and owner of a Staten Island, NY auto repair shop, had fled a US court trial on drug smuggling charges in the spring of 1981. The trio chartered a fishing boat in a southeast Italy village and were transported across the Adriatic Sea by the boat's skipper. Mustafa was killed by Albanian security forces on the beach near Fier where they landed from their chartered boat, as was Hazndari. The New Zealander was captured, tried and imprisoned for several years before being freed and deported to Auckland and his family. Prince Leka Zogu, pretender to the long-abolished Albanian throne, at first claimed a link to the strange events, but soon denied being involved. The second time, a few years later, that Unit 326 intervened against a common criminal who was barricaded in a house in Shkod√´r. With the fall of the Iron Curtain, and the apparent inability of the authorities to enforce law and order, the Unit began recruiting many conscripted soldiers in an effort to maintain an all-around capability to deal with the growing demand in law enforcement initiatives. At this time the only mandated duties were anti-riot. It was at this time (1991) when the unit registered its first fallen operative ‚Äì a 21-year-old killed in cold blood by a band of criminals. In January 1991, under pressure from the international community as well as Albanian public opinion, a general amnesty was declared for the political prisoners languishing in communist jails and work-camps. When common criminals, serving their sentences in the same jails, understood that the amnesty left them out, rioted. In the Shenkoll (trans:Saint Nicholas) penitentiary the riots were particularly violent were dozens of prisoners took hostage several guardians. The Unit was called into action and managed to bring about a solution to the crisis by using only tear- gas and plastic bullets, avoiding in the process any fatalities. Transformation With the change of regime, the new democratic government began an anti-communist crusade by dismissing many individuals ‚Äì investigators, attorneys, and police officers ‚Äì deemed compromised by association with the old regime. Organized crime, domestic and foreign, took advantage of the ensuing law and order vacuum and began spreading illegal activities in the country. With the deterioration of the situation, it became impossible for the unit to serve under a dual role ‚Äì anti riot and CT hostage rescue ‚Äì and for this reason in November 1991, following a strict and rigid selection, approximately eighty out of six-hundred of its members formed RENEA. The rest of the unit was folded into other elite units, such as Forcat e Nderhyrjes se Shpejte FNSh (Rapid Intervention Forces), organized according to the French CRS (Compagnies R√©publicaines de S√©curit√©), and U.S. SWAT. FNSH maintain a presence in 12 prefectures of the country.

The band formed in 2003 and are well known locally for their lively stage shows (referred to as 'parties'), catchy punk rock rants and drunken party mascot, \\"Ciderman\\". Although still relatively unknown on the national punk scene, they have a strong local following and a hard- working reputation. History =Earlyyears (2003‚Äì2006)= The InCiders logo From 2003 - 2006, the band were frequently seen smashing up smaller venues on the south coast of England, with the occasional adventure in other UK cities, including Wolverhampton in 2003. Since the band's inception they have shared stages with US Bombs, Ignite, The Business, Five Knuckle and Crack Rocky Steady Seven (members of Left√∂ver Crack). Remembered during the era for their drunken stage antics, some members of the band occasionally found the balance of consuming a sufficient level of alcohol to fuel their show and not over- indulging, so as to not to adversely affect their performance, a challenge. In a couple of instances, this resulted in their sound being cut mid-set, seemingly to their amusement. In 2003 and 2004, the band put on their own events under the name 'Fernstock' to sell-out crowds of 250+. Festival appearances include Jamfest (2003, 2005, 2006) and the first Endorse It In Dorset festival in 2004. =Split (2006‚Äì2010)= Despite being ready to record their first album, the band stopped playing together in 2006. The reason for the split was never officially confirmed, however rumours quickly spread regarding guitarist Kevin Goodwin's affirmation under the Jewish faith, resulting in a conflict of religious beliefs and band ethics. The split was however probably more likely the outcome of the closure of many small south coastal music venues (including Bournemouth's \\"Mr Smith's\\"), together with the troubles of an ever-changing drumming line-up. =Reformation (2010‚Äìpresent)= The band reformed in early 2010 with new drum machine and long-time friend, Chris Mackonochie (of None The Wiser and Henry's Phonograph) and a reborn enthusiasm. The band showcased their comeback gig on 5 June 2010 in their hometown of Bournemouth. The band's latest release, entitled MegaKill v.2 Turbo, was released on 14 May 2011 with downloadable versions made available and via the band's new website launched the same day. The band hosted a celebratory release party at which they performed their new material, together with classics from their back-catalogue. Unfortunately, the excitement of the new release was somewhat dampened by the unwelcome distraction of an arduous ongoing legal battle with a group of kids from north UK who have tried to plagiarise the band's well-established name. The band's legal representatives are said to have asked the northerners to cease and desist. In an interview with online magazine Volume Distortion (29 May 2011), the band promised of \\"plenty more of the ruckus and drunken stage shenanigans\\" to come and have said they are \\"already working on new material.\\" The band's played at Champions, Bournemouth with New York City punk band The Casualties on 26 July 2011. Musical style The band mixes fast punk chords, metal riffs and political lyrics, often centered on the theme of war. The band have however admitted trying to digress from war and self-confessed \\"pseudo- politics\\", preferring now discuss themes closer to the bands heart, such as the Vulcan Bomber, drinking to excess, Godzilla, their favourite comic book TV character Frank Gorshin and 'scene elitism', which they claim nearly caused the demise of the local scene and subsequently the band itself. The band claim to take inspiration from an array of musical styles. More apparent influences include Sick Of It All, Good Riddance, Anti-Flag, Death By Stereo, Municipal Waste and F-Minus.

The campus occupies in Musselburgh, East Lothian, Scotland. History The school was founded by the Reverend Thomas Langhorne in 1827. Langhorne came from Crosby Ravensworth in Westmorland. He named the school for Loretto House, his then home, which was itself named for a medieval chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Loreto which had formerly stood on the site of the school. The school was later taken over by his son, also Thomas Langhorne. The last link with the Langhorne family was Thomas' son John, who was a master at Loretto from 1890 to 1897, and later headmaster at John Watson's Institution.The Langhorne Memorial, The Levite, Vol IV, No.7 (Spring 1927)John Langhorne's grandfather (also John Langhorne, master of Giggleswick school) was the cousin and neighbour of Thomas Langhorne senior. See Crosby Ravensworth archives Loretto was later under the headmastership of Dr. Hely Hutchinson Almond from 1862 to 1903. In the 1950s the school increased the accommodation in science laboratories, established arts as a part of the curriculum and introduced the chapel service as part of the daily school life. The school originally accepted only boys, but in 1981 girls joined the sixth form and in 1995 the third form, so making the school fully co-educational by 1995. Loretto school's Pinkie House, built in the Scots baronial style In 2001 the film director Don Boyd published an article in The Observer detailing his systematic sexual abuse by a teacher in the school in the 1960s. The revelation led to further allegations about the teacher from other former pupils and subsequent calls for the teacher's prosecution. The teacher, then 79 years old, was charged, but the case was dropped on the grounds of his ill health. The teacher subsequently died. In 2017, it was announced that the school would be investigated as part of Lady Smith's inquiry into child sexual abuse. In 2010 the school was sued by an employee for sex discrimination: the employee felt she had been treated unfavourably following the announcement of her pregnancy. Judge Stewart Watt rejected the sexual discrimination claim asserting that 'there appears to be have been no ulterior motive to make [the employee] redundant during the review of the department; the only motive was to try to better organise the school', but he stated that the school had breached maternity regulations. The tribunal Judge was clear in his findings that 'the school at no point acted with an ulterior or blameworthy motive and that the breach of maternity leave regulations was quickly corrected.' In 2013, Loretto School was informed by the Scottish Charity Regulator that it did not qualify for charitable status for failing to provide sufficient public benefit. Subsequently, the school modified its means-tested bursary provision and has maintained full qualification as a registered charity ever since. Former Scotland rugby captain Jason White took his first steps into teaching with a role at the school in September 2017. In the same month it was announced that Jacob Slater, 15, a pupil at the school, would appear in the American-Scottish historical action drama Outlaw King about Robert the Bruce and the Wars of Scottish Independence, which will be distributed by Netflix. Jamie Parker, former Loretto School pupil and Royal Academy of Dramatic Art student, was named Best Actor at the Olivier Awards in April 2017 for his performance as Harry Potter. In September 2018, the employment of a teacher at the school was terminated who had been accused of inappropriate behaviour towards students. The investigation did not relate to current pupils of the school. There was no Police case in association with the matter. Loretto School was listed as the fourth highest Scottish independent school in the 2018 A level league tables. Facilities Loretto School is set in an 85-acre (34 hectare) campus and is made up of three parts: the Nursery for children aged 0 ‚Äì 5, the Junior School ('The Nippers') for children aged 5 ‚Äì 12, and the Senior School for those aged 12 ‚Äì 18. Pupils attend as boarders, flexi- boarders and day pupils and are all attached to a specific house. Houses include Schoolhouse (day pupils), Seton House (boys' boarding), Holm House (girls' boarding), Balcarres House (girls' boarding), Pinkie House (boys' boarding), Hope House (boys' boarding) and Eleanora Almond House. It was announced on 27 June 2018 that Eleanora Almond House would be temporarily closed at the end of the academic year for renovation and extension.

He held the royal title of Tupua Tamasese from 1929 to 1963, and O le Ao o le Malo (Head of State) jointly with Malietoa Tanumafili II from 1962 until his death the following year. Biography He was born in Vaimoso 1905 as the one of three sons of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi II. He was educated at the Marist school in Apia.Tamasese: Architect of West Samoan Independence Pacific Islands Monthly, May 1963, pp41‚Äì47 In 1929, he was installed as Tupua Tamasese when his elder brother and Mau leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated by colonial police during a Mau parade in Apia. He married Noue in 1934, a daughter of Olaf Frederick Nelson. The couple had four children; two daughters and two sons. In 1936 he was appointed to the Legislative Council, and in 1938 he was appointed as one of the Fautua (advisor to the Administrator). In the same year he became president of the Mau. As a Fautua, he continued to serve in the Legislative Council and its successor, the Legislative Assembly until 1957. He was also a member of the Council of State and the Executive Council until 1959. Away from politics, Tamasese was involved in business, serving as chair of the board of the Western Samoa Trust Estates Corporation, a director of the Bank of Western Samoa and a member of the Copra Board. In the 1957 New Year Honours he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In preparations for independence, Tamasese chaired the constitutional conventions of 1954 and 1960. When Western Samoa attained independence in 1962, the new constitution made Tupua Tamasese and Malietoa Tanumafili II (the two Fautua) joint heads of state. Upon Tamasese's death in April 1963, Malietoa continued to serve as sole head of state, whilst the title of Tupua Tamasese was passed to his eldest nephew, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi IV, who would go on to become the second Prime Minister of Samoa.

The Blasting Room is a recording studio in Fort Collins, Colorado. Founded by members of the punk rock band All in 1994, it is owned and operated by musician Bill Stevenson (Descendents, Black Flag, All, Only Crime) and Jason Livermore. The studio is known for recording and producing many punk rock bands, with Stevenson and Livermore serving as in- house audio engineers and record producers. In July 1994, the members of All relocated from Brookfield, Missouri to Fort Collins. Using money from their recent recording contract with Interscope Records, they designed and began construction of The Blasting Room with the help of guitarist Stephen Egerton's father, Dan O' Reilly. The studio opened four months later, featuring a two- inch analog 24-track tape machine, a mixing console manufactured by Solid State Logic, and a variety of outboard gear. The 4,000 square foot facility includes three recording studios: Studio A, the largest, features three isolation booths; The smaller Studio B has a separate control room; Studio C is a mixing and editing suite. In early 2018 The Blasting Room finished renovations that included the addition of a Mastering Suite designed by acoustician John H. Brandt. The Blasting Room also features a lounge, kitchen, and two bedrooms available to visiting artists. In addition to production, engineering, and mixing, the studio also offers audio mastering services done by Livermore.

He was born in Akron, Ohio to Swiss- German parents. The family then returned to Germany where he was raised. In 1911 he was awarded a Ph.D. by the University of Heidelberg with a focus on geology and paleontology. The same year he returned to the U.S. and joined the University of Cincinnati as a lecturer. By 1924 he was a professor of geology at the institution. His early works were on paleontology, and he performed studies of stromatolettia, oolites, and ripple-shaped markings. Later he concentrated on the Earth's crust diastrophism problem and proposed firstly (immediate and independent with Mikhail Tetyaev) the pulsation hypothesis of the Earth developing. In 1935 he became president of the Ohio Academy of Sciences. In 1940 he joined the Columbia University, specializing in structural geology. It is thought that at this time he worked as a consultant on the Manhattan Project, hypothesizing how the detonation of the atomic bomb could affect the Earth's crust. In the same year he joined the National Research Council, as a consultant as chairman of the Division of Geology and Geography. In 1946 he was elected president of the New York Academy of Sciences, and from 1950 until 1953 he served as president of the American Geophysical Union.

It is not mutually intelligible with other Plains Dogon languages, but is widely known as the prestige variety due to its use as the language of radio broadcasts. Dialects are Domno tegu, Gono tegu, Bama tegu, and Guru tegu; their degree of mutual intelligibility has not been recorded. Domno is the standard dialect, and considered the purest; Guru (Koro) is the dialect of that town. Phrases Jamsai gets its name from a common response to a greeting: Jam sai, or \\"peace only.\\" A typical Jam sai greeting goes like this: :A: Jam now (do you have peace in the morning?) :B: Jam sai (peace only) :A: Kanya now (do your people have peace in the morning?) :B: Jam sai :A: Taard√© The greeting then repeats, with B asking all the same questions of A. \\"Taard√©\\" is the way of the question asker telling the askee that he's done with his inquiry. A few other common phrases and words: * E nam sayoba? (Do your people have peace?) * Guinea nissama? (Did you sleep well?) * Nya ny√© (Eat!) * Ejuko (Good) * Ejila (Bad) * ni inim (Bathe‚Äîliterally to put water on oneself) * Ew√© (market) * Yayerrem (I will be right back‚Äîliterally \\"I am coming there\\") * miten (friend.

Science at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU) and the head of the BGU Negev Hi-Tech Faculty Startup Accelerator.  Biography Shlomi Dolev received B.Sc. in Civil Engineering and B.A. in Computer Science in 1984 and 1985, and his M.Sc. and D.Sc. in computer science in 1990 and 1992 from the Technion Israel Institute of Technology. From 1992 to 1995 he was at Texas A&M; University as a visiting research specialist. Academic career In 1995 Dolev joined the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at BGU. He was the founder and first department head of the Computer Science Department, established in 2000. After 15 years, the department was ranked among the first 150 best departments in the world. He is the author of Self-Stabilization published by MIT Press in 2000. From 2011 to 2014, Dolev served as Dean of the Natural Sciences Faculty. From 2010 he has served for six years, as the Head of the Inter University Computation Center of Israel. He is a co-founder, board member and CSO of Secret Double Octopus.Secret Double Octopus He is also a co-founder of Secret Sky (SecretSkyDB) Ltd. In 2015 Dolev was appointed head of the steering committee on computer science studies of the Israeli Ministry of Education.Computer-Robotics programming Dolev together with Yuval Elovici and Ehud Gudes established the Telekom Innovation Laboratories at Ben-Gurion University. Dolev was instrumental in establishing the IBM Cyber Security Center of Excellence (CCoE) in Collaboration with Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, and JVP Cyber Labs. Several agencies and companies support his research including ISF, NSF, IBM (faculty awards), Verisign, EMC, Intel, Orange France, Deutsche Telekom, US Airforce and the European Union in the sum of several millions of dollars. Dolev was a visiting professor at MIT, Paris 11, Paris 6 and DIMACS. He served in more than a hundred program committees, chairing two leading conferences in distributed computing, DISC 2006, and PODC 2014. Recently Prof. Dolev established and chaired the International Symposium on Cyber Security Cryptography and Machine Learning. Dolev serves as an Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Computers and PeerJ. Dolev became a fellow of the European Alliance for Innovation in 2019, (EAI), and in 2020 became IEEE fellow. Research work Dolev turned a workshop on self-stabilization (Austin,1989) into a series of events on the subject. Dolev's MA thesis, under the supervision of Shlomo Moran and Amos Israeli resulted in the most cited paper on self-stabilization, following the pioneering paper of Dijkstra introducing the concept of fair composition of self-stabilizing systems. Dolev's contribution to the investigation of self-stabilization spans several decades of research and publications, including research on randomized self- stabilizing algorithms, He has researched Super Stabilizing algorithms that react gracefully to dynamic changes while preserving the automatic recovery property offered by self-stabilizing systems. Dolev also introduced with co- authors, the concepts of, Silent Stabilization, Local stabilization, Practically Stabilizing, Self-stabilizing and Self-organizing, Transient Failure Detectors and yielding Labeling Schemes. He also presented the first silent self-stabilizing depth first search distributed algorithm. Another research interest is mobile ad-hoc networks, including the use of messages random walks, GeoQuarum and virtual infrastructure, where mobile devices currently populating a geographic region implement virtual automata for the region, yielding a fixed infrastructure. Dolev's research in cryptography and cyber security research contributions include the introduction of the xor- trees and buses, secret sharing communication and the accumulating automata and secret shared random-access machine, which evolved to patents and establishment of start-ups. Research on optical computing and complexity complements Dolev's cryptographic research, searching for the use of computation gaps, and provable hard on average instances. Dolev initiated a series of four optical supercomputing workshops and several journal special issues (e.g., Optical High-Performance Computing‚ÄîJOSA A and Applied Optics and Optical SuperComputing). Published several papers including a commentary in the Nature photonics journal, a nature communication contribution on reversible computing and a patent. Dolev has also contributed to research in Complex Networks, Hash Function Data Structures, Brain Science, Real-time Computation, Compression, Game Theory, Erasure Correcting, Transactional Memory, Error Correcting Computations, Verification, Machine Learning, Nanotechnology and Cache replacement policy.

As Racing UK grew several other business units and joint ventures were developed under the ownership of the parent company Racecourse Media Group Ltd. Racing TV is one of the two major UK horse racing television channels, the other being Sky Sports Racing. The station is dedicated to horse racing broadcasting over 70% of all live racing from Britain and Ireland, including nearly 90% of all Group and Graded races. On 17 December 2018, Racing UK was rebranded as Racing TV on air in anticipation of the first live broadcast of racing from the Republic of Ireland on 1 January 2019. At the same time, Racing TV began promoting its new Racing TV Extra service which provides viewers with dedicated feeds from each racecourse fixture via Streaming and OTT TV platforms. Racecourse Media Group Racecourse Media Group Ltd (RMG) is the umbrella organisation for the 34 Racecourses, which holds their interest in Racing TV, Racecourse Retail Business, Racing TVi and RDC. The racecourses (and shareholders) are: Aintree, Ayr, Beverley, Carlisle, Cartmel, Catterick Bridge, Cheltenham, Chelmsford, Epsom Downs, Exeter, Goodwood, Hamilton Park, Haydock Park, Huntingdon, Kelso, Kempton Park, Leicester, Ludlow, Market Rasen, Musselburgh, Newbury, Newmarket, Nottingham, Perth, Pontefract, Redcar, Salisbury, Sandown Park, Stratford, Taunton, Thirsk, Warwick, Wetherby, Wincanton and York.

The other channel's name was originally the \\"Horse Racing Channel\\" but this became ‚ÄúRacing UK‚Äù upon its launch on 29 May 2004 - when Rishi Persad presented its first live programme from Kempton - featuring racing from Kempton, Doncaster, Musselburgh and Cartmel. It remained Racing UK until its rebrand to Racing TV ahead of the launch of live racing from Ireland on 1 January 2019.  Programming  The channel starts broadcasting before live racing every day. In the mornings Racing Replay and/or Irish Racing Replay is shown until one of Mark Your Card, Full SP or Luck on Sunday are broadcast, live racing from the UK and Ireland typically follows in the afternoon and evening. The programmes have been produced in High-definition at Ealing Studios since 2012 and on location from the 61 racecourses.

It shares boundaries with Society Hill to the north, Bella Vista to the west and Pennsport to the south. Historically, the area is part of old Southwark, Philadelphia's first suburb, which was incorporated into the city in 1854 and remains the city's oldest residential neighborhood. Street boundaries are the south side of Lombard Street to the north side of Washington Avenue, the Delaware River to 6th Street, encompassing two principal commercial corridors, South Street and Fabric Row on 4th Street. Queen Village was known for its large Irish immigrant population. History =Founding= Philadelphia, c 1777. Southwark is the eastern region below the original planned grid of the city. The earliest European settlements in Queen Village were part of \\"New Sweden\\" in a region inhabited by indigenous Lenni Lenapi who themselves called the area \\"Wiccaco\\", or \\"Pleasant Place\\".Sitarski, Stephen. From Weccacoe to South Philadelphia: The Changing Face of a Neighborhood. Pennsylvania Historical Society New Sweden was contested by England, the Netherlands, and Sweden for several decades before large tracts of it came under British control as part of the 1681 land charter granted to William Penn, who renamed Philadelphia's first suburban settlement from \\"Wiccaco\\" to \\"Southwark,\\" after a district in London.Sitarksi, op cit. The best-known extant structure from this period is Old Swedes' Church (Gloria Dei) at Christian Street and Columbus Boulevard. Originally built as a block-house against the Lenape,Hazard, Samuel, 1850. Annals of Pennsylvania, from the discovery of the Delaware, 1609-1682. p. 438. Hazard and Mitchell. the church was completed in 1700 and is now the oldest surviving building within Philadelphia.Eds. Weigley, Russell F; Wainwright, Nicholas B; Wolf, Edwin, 1982. Philadelphia: A 300 Year History, p 11. Norton & Company. =Growth= Despite Penn's planned orderly east-to-west filling of the city, new inhabitants tended to stay close to the Delaware River, preferring to subdivide Penn's original ample lots or move just south or north of the city rather than west beyond 4th Street.Weigley, p. 15. To meet spill-over demand, Queen Village builders constructed homes cheaply from wood, although this had been outlawed due to fires within the city limits by 1796.Sitarki, op cit. Only a few wood plank front homes survive in Queen Village along the blocks of 800 South Hancock Street, 200 Christian Street, and 100 League Street. The Village diverged from the colonial city in cultural matters as well. Since Quakers forbid theater within the city limits, Queen Village, which offered a conveniently close strip for theaters to operate, was home to the first permanent playhouse in 1766 on South Street.Eds., Hartnoll, Phyllis; Found, Peter. The Concise Oxford Companion to the Theatre Mother Bethel AME Church in Philadelphia Anchored by Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church at Sixth and Lombard, the \\"Cedar Street Corridor\\" (South and Lombard streets from Fifth to Seventh) was the center of Philadelphia's free black community in the 18th and mid-19th centuries. The presence of free black churches and affordable housing encouraged African American settlement in Queen Village so that by 1820 this area was home to nearly two-thirds of all of Philadelphia's black families.Sitarski, op cit. By 1830, Queen Village as well as the southern parts of Southwark contained a thriving community of 20,000 who made their living as weavers, tailors, ship builders, mariners or as machinists and black smiths in iron foundries.Eds. Davis, Allen F., Haller Mark H, 1998, The Peoples of Philadelphia: a history of ethnic groups and lower-class life, 1790-1940, p. 71. University of Pennsylvania Press. Military industry was also present, including the Shot Tower and the US Naval Ship Yard, just south of Washington Avenue. Economic rivals clashed in the 1840s and 50s through opposing Labor Unions, street gangs and the notorious Southwark fire companies, most of which headquartered along Catharine and Queen Streets.Davis, p 76 After the district was formally consolidated into the City of Philadelphia in 1856, a beefed-up and centralized police force was deployedNash, Gary, 2006, First City: Philadelphia and the forging of historical memory, p178. University of Pennsylvania Press. to contain mayhem fueled largely by economic competition. By the 1890s, an Eastern European Jewish population settled along the South Street and 4th Street commercial corridors, the latter of which became Philadelphia's Fabric Row, and a significant number of Poles settled along the waterfront as dockworkers; large numbers of Italians began arriving and settling in Queen Village and South Philadelphia after 1910.Davis, p 205. Severe overcrowding resulted in poor local housing conditions which were countered by well-intentioned housing reform efforts, including the still-active Octavia Hill Association. In the first half of the 20th century, Queen Village had grown into a racially and ethnically diverse neighborhood of merchants and laborers living in dense enclaves, not unlike New York's Lower East Side. The worst aspects of the neighborhood between the wars are forever etched in the hyperbolic pulp noir novels of David Goodis. =Decline= Front and Bainbridge Streets, c. 1961 After WWII, for the first time in the area's 300 years history, Queen Village's population began to decline as families left the city for the suburbs. Further, in the 1960s, Edmund Bacon's central plan for Philadelphia cut off the neighborhood from its historical link to the river by driving I-95 through the neighborhood, demolishing some 300 historic structures in the process.Ed Knowles, Scott Gabriel, 2009, Imaging Philadelphia: Edmund Bacon and the city of the future, p. 122. University of Pennsylvania Press. Bacon also planned for a Crosstown Expressway, an east-to-west highway on South Street that would have cut Queen Village off from Center City, much as the Vine Street expressway has siloed northern neighborhoods from the heart of the city. Although the Expressway was successfully fought by a civic backlash led by Denise Scott Brown,Knowles p. 123. the impending threat of the highway caused South Street property values to plummet, driving away longtime businesses and leading to high vacancy and pockets of blight on South Street virtually from river to river. Around the same time, civic planners also experimented disastrously with federal housing projects to concentrate the urban poor in high-rise towers. Entire blocks between Christian Street and Washington Avenue were cleared to create the Southwark public housing project which quickly became a haven for drugs and violence. Although the housing projects have been torn down, the former location bore marks for many years. For example, Queen Village's intersection of Fifth and Carpenter Streets was listed number nine in a 2007 list of the city's top ten recreational drug corners according to an article by Philadelphia Weekly reporter Steve Volk.Volk, Steve. \\"Top 10 Drug Corners .\\" Philadelphia Weekly.

He previously was the Governor of Nova Scotia from 1712 to 1715, the Governor of Virginia from 1698 to 1705, the Governor of Maryland from 1694 to 1698, the Lieutenant Governor of Virginia from 1690 to 1692, and the Lieutenant Governor of the Dominion of New England from 1688 to 1689. Nicholson's military service included time in Africa and Europe, after which he was sent to North America as leader of the troops supporting Governor, Sir Edmund Andros in the Dominion of New England. There he distinguished himself, and was appointed lieutenant governor of the Dominion in 1688. After news of the Glorious Revolution and the overthrow of King James II reached the colonies in 1689, Andros was himself overthrown in the Boston Revolt. Nicholson himself was soon caught up in the civil unrest from Leisler's Rebellion in New York Town, and afterwards fled to England. Nicholson next served as lieutenant governor or governor of the colonial Provinces of Virginia and Maryland. He supported the founding of the College of William and Mary, at Williamsburg, Virginia, and quarreled with Andros after Andros was selected over him as Governor of Virginia. In 1709, he became involved in colonial military actions during Queen Anne's War (1702-1713, War of the Spanish Succession in Europe), leading an aborted expedition against the French in New France (modern Canada). He then led the expedition that successfully captured Port Royal, Acadia (Nova Scotia) on 2 October 1710. Afterward he served as governor of Nova Scotia and Placentia, and was the first royal governor of the colonial Province of South Carolina following a rebellion against its proprietors. He rose to the rank of Lieutenant-General, and died a bachelor in London, England, in 1728. Nicholson supported public education in the colonies, and was a member of both the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts and the Royal Society. He also influenced American architecture, being responsible for the planned layout and design of colonial/provincial capitals of Annapolis, Maryland and Williamsburg, Virginia. He was one of the earliest advocates of colonial union, principally for reasons of defense against common enemies. Early life and military service Nicholson was born in the village of Downholme, Yorkshire, England, on 12 November 1655. Little is known of his ancestry or early life, although he apparently received some education.Dunn, p. 61 He served as a page in the household of Charles Paulet (later the Marquess of Winchester and the Duke of Bolton), under whose patronage his career would be advanced. He waited on Paulet's daughter Jane, who married John Egerton, Earl of Bridgewater, another patron who promoted his career. His military career began in January 1678 when Paulet purchased for him an ensign's commission in the Holland Regiment, in which he saw service against the French in Flanders.Webb (1966), p. 515Dunn, p. 62 The regiment saw no combat, and was disbanded at the end of the year. In July 1680 he purchased a staff lieutenant's commission in the newly formed 2nd Tangier Regiment, which was sent to English Tangier to reinforce the garrison holding the city. Tangier's council was then headed by the Duke of York (later King James II), and its governor was Colonel Percy Kirke. Nicholson distinguished himself in the service, carrying dispatches between the enemy Moroccan camp, Tangier, and London. In addition to favorable notice from Kirke, this brought Nicholson to the attention of the powerful colonial secretary, William Blathwayt.Dunn, p. 63 Tangier was abandoned in 1683, and his regiment returned to England. During the service in Tangier he met a number of people who would figure prominently North American colonial history, including Thomas Dongan and Alexander Spotswood.Webb (1966), p. 516 Nicholson was probably with the regiment when it put down Monmouth's Rebellion in 1685, but his role in some of the more unsavory behaviour on the part of Kirke's troops is unknown. Kirke, who had been selected by Charles II as the governor of the prospective Dominion of New England, was strongly criticized for his role in the quashing of the rebellion, and James withdrew his nomination. The dominion's governorship instead went to Sir Edmund Andros, and Nicholson, now a captain, accompanied Andros as commander of a company of infantry to Boston in October 1686.Dunn, p. 64 Andros sent Nicholson on what was essentially a reconnaissance mission to French Acadia. Under the cover of delivering a letter protesting a variety of issues to the Acadian governor, Nicholson made careful observations of Port Royal's defenses.Waller, p. 53 Nicholson impressed Andros in this service, and was soon appointed to the dominion's council.Webb (1966), p. 520 Dominion lieutenant governor Sir Edmund Andros In 1688 the Lords of Trade extended the dominion to include New York and East and West Jersey. Nicholson was commissioned the dominion's lieutenant governor, and traveled with Andros to New York to take control of those colonies. Nicholson's rule, in which he was assisted by a local council but no legislative assembly, was seen by many New Yorkers as the next in a line of royal governors who \\"had in a most arbitrary way subverted our ancient privileges\\".Webb (1966), p. 522 Nicholson justified his rule by stating that the colonists were \\"a conquered people, and therefore ... could not could not so much [as] claim rights and priviledges as Englishmen\\". Nicholson was at first seen as an improvement over the Catholic Thomas Dongan, the outgoing governor. However, the province's old guard was unhappy that Andros removed all of the provincial records to Boston, and then Nicholson alarmed the sometimes hardline Protestant population by preserving the trappings of the chapel in Fort James that Dongan and the handful of New York's Catholics had used for worship.Sommerville, p. 202 In response to a rumored Dutch invasion of England (a rumor that turned out to be true), Nicholson in January 1689 ordered the provincial militias to be on alert to protect the province for the king. Unknown to Nicholson, events in England had already changed things.Sommerville, p. 203 =Rebellion in Boston= Engraving depicting the arrest of Andros After James was deposed by William III and Mary II in the Glorious Revolution in late 1688, Massachusetts rose up in rebellion against Andros, arresting him and other dominion leaders in Boston.Dunn, p. 65 The revolt rapidly spread through the dominion, and the New England colonies quickly restored their pre-dominion governments. When news of the Boston revolt reached New York a week later,Webb (1966), p. 523 Nicholson took no steps to announce news of it, or of the revolution in England, for fear of raising prospects of rebellion in New York.Lovejoy, p. 252 When word of the Boston revolt reached Long Island, politicians and militia leaders became more assertive, and by mid-May dominion officials had been ousted from a number of communities.Lovejoy, p. 253 At the same time, Nicholson learned that France had declared war on England, bringing the threat of French and Indian attacks on New York's northern frontier. In an attempt to mollify panicked citizenry over rumored Indian raids, Nicholson invited the militia to join the army garrison at Fort James.Webb (1966), p. 524 Because New York's defenses were in poor condition, Nicholson's council voted to impose import duties to improve them. This move was met with immediate resistance, with a number of merchants refusing to pay the duty. One in particular was Jacob Leisler, a well-born German Calvinist immigrant merchant and militia captain. Leisler was a vocal opponent of the dominion regime, which he saw as an attempt to impose \\"popery\\" on the province, and may have played a role in subverting Nicholson's regulars.Webb (1998), p. 202 On 22 May Nicholson's council was petitioned by the militia, who, in addition to seeking more rapid improvement to the city's defenses, also wanted access to the powder magazine in the fort. This latter request was denied, heightening concerns that the city had inadequate powder supplies. This concern was further exacerbated when city leaders began hunting through the city for additional supplies.McCormick, pp. 175‚Äì176 =Rebellion in New York= A minor incident on 30 May 1689 in which Nicholson made an intemperate remark to a militia officer then flared into open rebellion. Nicholson, who was well known for his temper, told the officer \\"I rather would see the Towne on fire than to be commanded by you\\".McCormick, p. 179 Rumors flew around the town that Nicholson was in fact prepared to burn it down. The next day Nicholson summoned the officer, and demanded he surrender his commission. Abraham de Peyster, the officer's commander and one of the wealthiest men in the city, then engaged in a heated argument with Nicholson, after which de Peyster and his brother Johannis, also a militia captain, stormed out of the council chamber. The militia was called out, and descended en masse to Fort James, which they occupied.Lovejoy, p. 255 An officer was sent to the council to demand the keys to the powder magazine, which Nicholson eventually surrendered, to \\"hinder and prevent bloodshed and further mischiefe\\".McCormick, p. 181 The following day, a council of militia officers called on Jacob Leisler to take command of the city militia. He did so, and the rebels issued a declaration that they would hold the fort on behalf of the new monarchs until they sent a properly accredited governor.Webb (1998), p. 203 At this point the militia controlled the fort, which gave them control over the harbor. When ships arrived in the harbor, they brought passengers and captains directly to the fort, cutting off outside communications to Nicholson and his council. On 6 June, Nicholson decided to leave for England, and began gathering depositions for use in proceedings there. He left the city on 10 June for the Jersey shore, where he hoped to join Thomas Dongan, who was expected to sail for England soon thereafter.McCormick, p. 210 However, it was not until 24 June that he actually managed to sail; he was denied passage on a number of ships, and eventually purchased a share of Dongan's brigantine in order to get away.Sommerville, p. 217 In the meantime, Leisler proclaimed the rule of William and Mary on 22 June, and on the 28th a provincial committee of safety, acting in the absence of legitimate authority, chose Leisler to be the province's commander-in-chief.McCormick, p. 221 Upon Nicholson's arrival in London in August, he outlined the situation in New York to the king and the Lords of Trade, urging the appointment of a new governor of New York, preferably himself.Sommerville, p. 218 Despite the efforts of Charles Paulet (now Duke of Bolton) and other patrons, William in November instead chose Colonel Henry Sloughter to be the next governor of New York. The king did, however, acknowledge Nicholson's efforts with the lieutenant governorship of Virginia.Sommerville, p. 219 Virginia and Maryland Nicholson was lieutenant governor of Virginia until 1692, serving under the absentee Governor Lord Howard of Effingham. During this tenure, he was instrumental in the creation of the College of William and Mary and named as one of its original trustees. He worked to improve the provincial militia, and approved the establishment of additional ports of trade in the province. The latter was not without some opposition from some of the larger merchants in the province, who saw the additional ports as a competitive threat.Dunn, pp. 66‚Äì67 During this time Nicholson was one of the only high-level representatives of Crown Rule in the colonies: most Crown Rule had been eliminated in the northern colonies, and the other southern colonies were governed by proprietary governors. Nicholson recommended to the King that, in order to better establish a common social order and a coordinated defense, Crown Rule should be established over all of the colonies as quickly as possible, including the conversion of the proprietary colonies to crown colonies.Webb (1966), p. 527 The earliest known map of Annapolis, a 1743 copy of a 1718 map Lord Effingham resigned the Virginia governorship in February 1692, beginning a contest between Nicholson and Andros for the Virginia governorship. Andros, who was in London and was a more senior figure, was awarded the post, much to Nicholson's annoyance.Lustig, p. 226 The episode deepened a growing dislike between the two men. One contemporary chronicler wrote that Nicholson \\"especially [resented] Sir Edmund Andros, against whom he has a particular pique on account of some earlier dealings\\", and Nicholson, placated with the lieutenant governorship of Maryland, worked from then on to unseat Andros.Lustig, p. 242 When Andros arrived in September 1692, Nicholson graciously received him before sailing for London.Lustig, p. 228 Nicholson was still in England in 1693 when Maryland Governor, Sir Lionel Copley died. Under provisions of his commission, and at the request of the Maryland governor's council, Andros went to Maryland in September 1693 to organize affairs, and again in May 1694 to preside over the provincial court. For these services he was paid ¬£500.Lustig, pp. 243‚Äì244 When Nicholson, now appointed governor of Maryland, arrived in July, he found the provincial treasury empty, and testily demanded that Andros return the payment.Lustig, p. 245 Andros refused, and Nicholson appealed to the Lords of Trade. They ruled in October 1696 that Andros had to return ¬£300.Lustig, p. 246 By this time, Nicholson was living in the house of Edward Dorsey. Nicholson, a committed Anglican as a member of the Church of England, sought to reduce Roman Catholic influence in the Maryland government, and moved the old colonial capital from the Catholic stronghold of St. Mary's City in southern Maryland's St. Mary's County along the Potomac River to what was then called \\"Anne Arundel's Town\\" (also known briefly as \\"Providence\\"), which was later renamed \\"Annapolis\\" in honour of the future monarch, Princess Anne. He chose its site and laid out the plan for the town, placing the Anglican (later Episcopal church and the state house in well-designed public spaces (known later as \\"State Circle\\" and \\"Church Circle\\") and the use of diagonal avenues to connect various parts of the town (foreseeing details of Pierre L'Enfant's, (1754-1825), plan for the National Capital or \\"Federal City\\" in Washington and the District of Columbia, a century later. Architectural historian Mark Childs describes Annapolis, along with Williamsburg, Virginia, which Nicholson also laid out during his later tenure there, as some of the best-designed towns in the British Empire.Childs, pp. 30‚Äì31 James Blair, whose efforts to found the College of William and Mary Nicholson supported Nicholson was a supporter of public education, promoting laws to support it, and funded the construction of \\"King William's School\\"Riley, Elihu S. (1887). The Ancient City, A History of Annapolis in Maryland, Annapolis Record Printing Office. (predecessor/ancestor to today's St. John's College, a noted academic humanities, liberal arts school, emphasing a \\"classical education\\" and \\"The Great Books\\"). He became embroiled in a dispute with William Penn from the Middle Atlantic colony to the north, over how to deal with the issue of piracy. In Maryland, Nicholson vigorously cracked down on the practices of some colonists to tolerate pirates, who brought goods and hard currency into the provinces. Aware that Penn's governor William Markham was similarly tolerant (he was said to be taking bribes to allow pirates such as Thomas Day to trade in Pennsylvania), Nicholson ordered that ships destined for Pennsylvania be stopped and searched in Maryland waters, and collected duties if they were carrying European finished goods. Penn protested to the Board of Trade, and the dispute subsided when Nicholson moderated his tactics.Dunn, p. 69 During Nicholson's rule in Maryland, he specifically denied that the colonists had the Rights of Englishmen, writing that \\"if I had not hampered them [colonial interests] in Maryland, and kept them under, I should never have been able to govern them.\\"Webb (1966), p. 534 His feud with pirates took a personal turn when in 1700 he accompanied the captain of HMS Shoreham in a fierce all-day battle against French pirate Louis Guittar. The defeated pirates asked Nicholson for quarter and pardon; he granted them quarter but referred them to King William III of England for mercy, in whose courts Guittar and his crew were all sentenced to hang. Nicholson's feud with Andros persisted, and Nicholson acquired a powerful ally in James Blair, the founder of the College of William and Mary. The two were able to gain the support of the Anglican establishment in England against Andros, and filed a long list of complaints with the Lords of Trade. These efforts were successful in convincing Andros to request permission to resign, and in December 1698, Nicholson was given the governorship of Virginia. Andros angrily refused to give Nicholson his records.Lustig, pp. 256‚Äì265 During his term, which lasted until 1705, Nicholson was largely at the mercy of his council, which was dominated by a small group of powerful Virginia families. The Andros rule had been so unpopular in Virginia that Nicholson's instructions gave him little leeway in acting without their consent. At one point Nicholson characterized the Virginia council as \\"mere brutes who understand not manners\\".Fiske, p. 115 Nicholson made a number of unsuccessful attempts to alter the balance of power, including moving the provincial capital from Jamestown to Middle Plantation, which was renamed Williamsburg.Steele, pp. 71‚Äì72 Although he was opposed by the upper house, the colonial legislature was generally supportive of him, and he continued to be favored by the London government.Steele, p. 74 A 1702 map showing Williamsburg, Virginia Nicholson was exposed to French activities on the Mississippi River while governor of Maryland. He warned the Board of Trade in 1695 that the French were working to complete the designs of explorer Robert La Salle to gain control of the river and dominate the Indian relations in the interior, which \\"may be of fatal consequence\\" to the English colonies.Crane, p. 60 He reiterated the warning in a 1698 report, and suggested that the Board of Trade issue instructions to all of the governors encouraging the development of trade with Indians across the Appalachian Mountains. \\"I am afraid\\", he wrote, \\"that now please God, there is a peace, the French will be able to doe more dammage to these Countrys, than they were able to doe in the [King William's] War .\\"Crane, p. 61 These observations were among the earliest anyone made concerning the threat French expansion posed to the English, and some of his suggestions were ultimately adopted as policy. He actively promoted the idea of expansionist trade on the frontier with other colonial governors, including Bellomont of New York, and Blake of South Carolina.Crane, pp. 62‚Äì63 Following a political crisis in England and the accession of Queen Anne to the throne in 1702, a Tory ministry emerged that sidelined most of Nicholson's Whig patrons. Despite his best efforts to retain his post, he was recalled and replaced in 1705 by Edward Nott.Dunn, pp. 73‚Äì74 He returned to London, where he was active in the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, and was awarded membership in the Royal Society for his scientific observations of North America. He also acted as a consultant to the Board of Trade, and thus maintained an awareness of colonial issues.Webb (1966), p. 542 Queen Anne's War Nicholson worked with Samuel Vetch during the war, but then turned against him afterward During King William's War in the 1690s Nicholson asked the House of Burgesses to appropriate money for New York's defense, since it was threatened from New France and acted as a buffer to protect Virginia. The Burgesses refused, even after Nicholson appealed to London.Howlson, p. 408 When Queen Anne's War broke out in 1702, Nicholson lent New York ¬£900 of his own money, with the expectation that it would be repaid from Virginia's quit rents (it was not).Howlson, pp. 409‚Äì410 The publicity of this scheme increased dislike of him in Virginia, and may have played a role in his recall.Howlson, p. 411 Virginia was not militarily affected by the war.Howlson, p. 413 These efforts by Nicholson to gain broader colonial support for the war were followed by larger proposals to London, suggesting, for example, that all of the colonies be joined under a single viceroy, who would have power of taxation and control of a standing army. According to historian John Fiske, Nicholson was one of the first people to propose uniting all of the North American colonies in this way.Fiske, p. 130 In the course of the ten-year conflict in North America now known as Queen Anne's War,the European theatre of which is known as the War of the Spanish Succession Samuel Vetch, a Scottish businessman with interests in New York and New England, came to London during the winter of 1708‚Äì9 and proposed to the Queen and the Board of Trade a major assault on New France.McCully, p. 442 He recruited Nicholson to join the effort, which was to include a sea-based attack on Quebec with Royal Navy support, and a land-based expedition to ascend the Hudson River, descend Lake Champlain, and attack Montreal.Carr, p. 98 Nicholson was given command of the land-based effort while Vetch was to command the provincial militia of New England that were to accompany the fleet. Arriving in Boston in April 1709 Nicholson and Vetch immediately began raising the forces and supplies needed for these operations. Nicholson was able to draw on his earlier connections to New York's aristocracy to recruit the needed forces from there, with additional units coming from New Jersey and Connecticut.Carr, pp. 99‚Äì100 He raised a force of about 1,500 regulars and provincial militia and 600 Iroquois, and in June began the construction of three major encampments between Stillwater, just north of Albany, and the southern end of Lake Champlain, while awaiting word of the fleet's arrival in Boston. The expedition turned out to be a disaster. Many men became sick and died from the poor conditions in the camps as the summer dragged on without any news of the fleet. Supplies ran short the men became mutinous and began deserting. Finally, in October Nicholson learned that, due to circumstances in Europe, the fleet's participation had been canceled in July. By this time the men were deserting by whole units and destroyed all of the fortifications and stores.McCully, p. 443 In the aftermath of the debacle Nicholson returned to London, taking four Indian chiefs with him, and petitioned Queen Anne for permission to lead a more limited expedition against Port Royal, the capital of French Acadia.Drake, pp. 254‚Äì255 The Queen granted the petition, and Nicholson was in charge of the forces that captured Port Royal on 2 October 1710. This battle marked the conquest of Acadia, and began permanent British control over the territory they called Nova Scotia.Drake, pp. 259‚Äì261 Nicholson published an account of the expedition in his 1711 Journal of an Expedition for the Reduction of Port Royal.Nicholson The victorious Nicholson returned to England to petition Queen Anne for another expedition to capture the center of New France, Quebec. The resulting naval expedition was led by Admiral Hovenden Walker, and Nicholson led an associated land expedition that retraced the route he had taken in 1709 toward Lake Champlain. Many ships of Walker's fleet foundered on rocks near the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River, and the whole expedition was cancelled, much to Nicholson's anger; he was reported to tear off his wig and throw it to the ground when he heard the news.Parkman, pp. 170‚Äì171 Nova Scotia and South Carolina Nicholson returned to London after the failed expedition, and began working to acquire for himself the governorship of Nova Scotia. After the 1710 victory, Samuel Vetch had become its governor, but his rule over the colony (where he only really controlled Port Royal itself) was somewhat ineffective.Plank, pp. 57‚Äì58 Vetch and the Tory ministry then in power disagreed on how to handle affairs, especially with respect to the resident French Catholic population,Plank, pp. 58‚Äì60 and Nicholson capitalized on these complaints. In a dispute marked by bitterness and sometimes extreme accusations (Vetch, for example, accused Nicholson of Jacobite sympathies),Plank, pp. 59‚Äì61 Nicholson was awarded the post in October 1712. His commission also included the governorship of Placentia, and authority as auditor of all colonial accounts. He only spent a few weeks in Port Royal in 1714, leaving most of the governance to lieutenant governor Thomas Caulfeild. These few weeks were marked by discord with the Acadians, who sought to capitalize on the change of governor to gain concessions Nicholson was not prepared to give. Nicholson also issued order restricting the interaction between the troops and the town, resulting in the further reduction of already-poor morale in the Port Royal garrison.Plank, pp. 61‚Äì62 He also cracked down on open trade between British colonial merchants and the French, requiring the licensing of any British merchant wanting to trade at French ports.Waller, p. 255 Nicholson spent most of his time as Nova Scotia governor in Boston, where he devoted a significant amount of time investigating Vetch's finances. Vetch interpreted Nicholson's hostile and intrusive examination of his affairs as a largely partisan attempt to smear him. He called Nicholson a \\"malicious madman\\" who would do anything that \\"fury, malice, and madness could inspire.\\" Nicholson attempted to prevent Vetch from sailing for England where he might better defend himself, forcing Vetch to flee beyond Nicholson's reach to New London, Connecticut, in order to get a ship for England.Waller, p. 258 With the accession of George I to the throne and the change to a Whig ministry, Vetch succeeded in clearing his name and recovered his post from Nicholson, who was accused by Vetch and others of neglecting the province. Catawba chief and given to Nicholson. Charleston is to the left, the circles represent distinct tribes or clans, and the lines between them represent connections between those groups. Nicholson next served as the first royal governor of South Carolina from 1721 to 1725. The colonists had rebelled against the rule of the proprietors, and Nicholson was appointed in response to their request for crown governance.Weir, pp. 101‚Äì104 The rebellion had been prompted by inadequate response by the proprietors to Indian threats, so Nicholson brought with him some British troops.Webb (1966), p. 547 He established a council composed primarily of supporters of the rebellion, and gave it significant latitude to control colonial affairs.Sirmans, p. 382 As he had in some of his other posts, he used enforcement of the Navigation Acts as a means to crack down on political opposition. He established local governments modeled on those he set up in Maryland and Virginia, including the 1722 incorporation of Charleston.Weir, p. 107 He expended both public money and his own to further both education and the Church of England,Weir, p. 106 and introduced ground-breaking judicial administration into the colony. He negotiated agreements and territorial boundaries with the Cherokee,Power, p. 62 and promoted trade, pursuing policies similar to those he had advocated while in Maryland and Virginia.Crane, p. 112 He introduced a commissioner of Indian affairs into the colonial government, a post that survived until the crown assumed the duties of managing Indian affairs in the 1750s.Crane, p. 200 Like other colonies, South Carolina suffered from chronic shortages of currency, and issued bills of credit to compensate. During Nicholson's administration this was done several times, but the inflationary consequences did not reach crisis proportions until after he left the colony.Weir, pp. 108‚Äì109 It did, however, anger merchant interests enough to raise complaints against him with the Board of Trade. Combined with long-running but false accusations by William Rhett and other supporters of the proprietors that Nicholson was improperly engaged in smuggling, he felt the need to return to England to defend himself against these charges. He returned to London in 1725,Weir, pp. 107,109 carrying with him Cherokee baskets that became part of the earliest collections in the British Museum.Hill, p. 58 Later life In England, Nicholson was promoted to lieutenant-general. He never married, and died in London on 5/16 March 1728/9. He was buried in the parish of St George Hanover Square. A claim cited in some 19th-century biographies that he was knighted turned out to be false when his will was discovered early in the 20th century.Dalton, p. 399 Personality Nicholson was notorious for his temper. He was, according to historian George Waller, \\"subject to fits of passion\\". In one story, an Indian said of Nicholson, \\"The general is drunk.\\" When informed that Nicholson did not partake of strong drink, the Indian replied, \\"I do not mean that he is drunk with rum, he was born drunk.\\"Waller, p. 257 Waller also points out that his \\"hasty and overmastering temper led him into great excesses\\".Waller, p. 276 Legacy Nicholson Hall of the College of William and Mary is named in honor of Francis Nicholson. Additionally the two main streets of Colonial Williamsburg, one block north and south of the central street (Duke of Gloucester St.) are named Francis and Nicholson, in his honor.

It is named after the original name of North 167th Street, Golden Glades Road. Description View of the Miami skyline from the express lane overpass The six highways that come together at the interchange are U.S. Route 441 (US 441), Florida's Turnpike, the Palmetto Expressway (signed State Road 826), SR 9, North Miami Beach Boulevard (167th Street) and Interstate 95 (I-95). US 441 bears SR 7 as a hidden designation, and the turnpike is similarly SR 91. SR 9 is the hidden designation for I-95 north of the interchange but branches southward off I-95 to become a major commercial road on its own accord. South of the interchange, I-95 bears SR 9A as its hidden designation. History The Golden Glades interchange initially opened as an intersection between US 441 and SR 826 in 1953, expanding into its current form in the next decade. Its construction was prompted by a sequence of events spanning 12 years. In 1950, US 441 was extended from downtown Orlando to Miami to connect with a stretch of US 41 which sported US 94 road signs just a year earlier. In 1957, Florida's Turnpike (then called the Sunshine State Parkway) was completed in Dade (later Miami-Dade) County, joining SR 826 (which, at the time was Golden Glades Drive, an east‚Äìwest street connecting US 1 along Biscayne Bay to US 27 inland). In 1958, construction of the north‚Äìsouth section of the Palmetto Bypass Expressway started, using SR 826 with a 90-degree eastward curve (the western section of SR 826 was to be abandoned). In 1959, construction of a segment of I-95, from Northwest 20th Street in Miami to SR 84 in Fort Lauderdale was started, along with I-195 and the Airport Expressway (SR 112) for access to Miami Beach and Miami International Airport. In 1961, construction of the Palmetto Bypass Expressway (the name was unofficially shortened in the mid 1960s), the Airport Expressway (then called the 36th Street Tollway), and the segment of I-95 south of Northwest 95th Street in Dade County were completed. Anticipating increasing traffic to and from Dade County, FDOT broke ground on May 18, 1962, for the new Golden Glades Interchange. The section of I-95 from Golden Glades to SR 84 was completed in 1963; the Golden Glades Interchange and I-95 south to Northwest 95th Street opened on June 9, 1964. The interchange was also known as the Interama Interchange until it was renamed the Golden Glades Interchange in 1977. Flyovers to a commuter train station and bus terminal (in the 1970s) and elevated HOV lanes (in 1995) have been added to it to accommodate the growing regional population, which has more than doubled since the interchange's opening. There were plans in the 1980s to reconstruct the interchange, but they were dropped due to high construction costs. The Golden Glades has been expanded and worked on several times over the years and is seen as a bottleneck in traffic on all the roads it incorporates. In 2017, the Florida Department of Transportation plans to widen the turnpike connector to I-95 to five lanes, including two lanes from the turnpike and three lanes from the eastbound Palmetto Expressway. Three lanes will exit to a relocated off- ramp to State Road 7 while the other three lanes will continue to I-95, which will get another lane between the Golden Glades and Northwest 151st Street. The entrance to the southbound express lanes south of the Golden Glades also will be moved 300 feet further south. In addition, the eastbound Palmetto ramp to I-95 will be widened to three lanes ‚Äì two to southbound I-95 and one on a new direct ramp to northbound I-95.

Its design was based upon the F3U-1 two-seat fighter that was abandoned when the Navy decided not to obtain any more two-seat fighters. Design and development The aircraft was equipped with a closed cockpit, had fixed landing gear, and was powered by a Pratt & Whitney R-1535 radial air-cooled engine as had the F3U-1, but also included a controllable pitch propeller and a new NACA cowl with adjustable cowling gills on the trailing edge of the cowl. The adjustable cowling gills permitted better control of cooling airflow over the engine. The SBU-1 completed flight tests in 1934 and went into production under a contract awarded in January 1935. The Corsair was the first aircraft of its type, a scout bomber, to fly faster than 200 mph.

Statue of Sir Thomas White in Coventry, West Midlands Sir Thomas White (1492 ‚Äì 12 February 1567) was an English cloth merchant, Lord Mayor of London in 1553, and a civic benefactor and founder of St John's College, Oxford. Biography He was born in Reading, Berkshire, the son of William White, a clothier of Reading, and his wife, Mary, daughter of John Kibblewhite of South Fawley, also in Berkshire. He was brought up in London. Sir Thomas was twice married, to Avicia (died 1558) and to Joan.Mark Noble p. 23, states that Joan married first Sir Ralph Warren, and was called upon her monument \\"daughter and co- heiress of John Lake, of London, gent,\\"; but most of the Cromwell family pedigrees, and the visitation of Huntingdonshire in 1613, say she was daughter and co-heiress of John Trelake, alias Davy, of Cornwall, gent. She survived Sir Ralph, and remarried Sir Thomas White, knt. and died at her son-in-law Sir Henry Cromwell's seat, at Hinchinbrook, 8 October, and was buried 4 November 1573, in the church of St. Swyth, leaving by her first husband one son, named Richard and a daughter, lady Joan, the wife of Sir Henry Cromwell, (Richard the son settled at Claybury, in Essex) and the daughter Joan was the grandmother of Oliver Cromwell. Noble (p. 24.) states that all of this is mentioned in the inscription upon her monument, which read thus: He continues the said Sir Henry Williams, alias Cromwell, had issue by the lady Joan, his wife, Oliver Cromwell, esq. his son and heir, with other sons.

He was knighted in the same year by Queen Mary I. He was a member of the commission for the trial of Lady Jane Grey. In 1555, inspired by the example of Thomas Pope, founder of Trinity College, Oxford, White obtained a royal licence for the foundation of St John's College, Oxford, dedicated to the patron saint of the Merchant Taylors and established in the buildings of the dissolved Cistercian College of St Bernard. He was involved in the foundation of Merchant Taylors' School, and made provision that scholars of the college should be nominated from pupils of the school. He also established scholarships at St John's College, tenable by pupils of Tonbridge School, Bristol Grammar School, Reading School and King Henry VIII School, Coventry,Hill, C.P. (1951) The History of Bristol Grammar School, p.46 where one of the school's four houses bears his name. He purchased Gloucester Hall and set it up in 1560 as a hall of residence for scholars; this became the basis of the later foundation of Worcester College. As a result of his philanthropy, he was listed in Richard Johnson's Nine Worthies of London in 1592. Sir Thomas White Loan Charity The charity was founded in 1542 and is still extant. It gives interest-free loans to aspiring businesspeople in Leicestershire and Rutland. There are several memorials to White in England and he is honoured on Leicester's Clock Tower.

Paul Friedberg, FASLA, (born 1931) is an American landscape architect. Biography M. Paul Friedberg was born in New York City where he attended Cornell University. In 1954 he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree. He said that \\"after navigating four socially active years the reality of growing up set in.\\" He said that his largest influence for pursuing landscape architecture was the chance to connect people to themselves, to each other and to their environment. In 1958, four years after graduating, Friedberg opened his landscape practice, M. Paul Friedberg and Partners. The contributions the firm has made to the aesthetic environment of urban life have been revolutionary in design and intent. Here, he soon became a leading Landscape Architect of new public spaces. All of which included plazas, main strip malls, and small vest-pocket parks. Paul Friedberg also established the first undergraduate landscape architecture program in a major city at the City College of New York, focusing on the social and physical issues inherent to an urban environment. In 1965 M. Paul Friedberg designed an innovative play area at Riis plaza that would later be demolished in 2000. This innovative play area was created to allow children of different ages to utilize the many different structures including a series of pyramids, mounds, and a tunnel in many ways. In his seventies, M. Paul Friedberg continues to work and design at an amazing pace. To sum up his job, Friedberg happily smiles and says it is \\"not a bad way to spend [my] day,\\" . Due to Friedberg, landscape architecture was brought into the field of urban design on a large scale through the wide variety of urban spaces represented by his work. His personal philosophy is summed up in the following quote: :Design is a personal journey. The fact that I have the power to alter the appearance and content of a site merely by placing ideas on a piece of paper or a screen, is an ongoing adventure-and exploration into the unknown about how space and form can direct human response. It is about the discovery of myself, my aesthetic preference and social values at a given point in time. I create three-dimensionally what the writer accomplishes with words. It is not without anxiety, as the ideas haven't a reality until cast in a space and experienced.--M. Paul Friedberg, Silent Auction Jacob Riis Plaza One of Friedberg's most notable projects was the Jacob Riis Plaza, undertaken in the mid 1960s. The Jacob Riis Complex is a series of 14-story buildings along the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The large open spaces between the blocks were poorly laid out, with little consideration of the residents' needs. Friedberg's redesign separated the space into human scaled areas using pergolas, terraces and mounds. Materials and features were selected for their robustness, for example large timbers, and vandal resistant lighting.

The film stars Danny Dyer, Tamer Hassan and Roland Manookian, all of whom were in Love's previous film The Football Factory. Geoff Bell and Georgina Chapman also appear. The plot of The Business follows the Greek tragedy-like rise and fall of a young cockney's career within a drug importing business run by a group of British ex-pat fugitive criminals living on the coast of the Costa del Sol in Spain. Plot The film is narrated by Frankie (Dyer), a young everyman living in South East London during the Thatcher era of the 1980s specially 1984, with little hope of ever making anything of himself, yet he dreams of \\"being somebody\\" and escaping his lonely, dreary lifestyle. After severely beating his mother's abusive boyfriend, he becomes a fugitive, and through family connections escapes to the Costa del Sol. His job there is to deliver a bag containing money to \\"Playboy Charlie\\" (Hassan), an ex-pat and criminal-on-the-run, a suave and dapper man who runs his own nightclub. Impressed by Frankie's honesty in not opening the bag, Charlie takes a liking to Frankie, introduces him to his business associates, including the psychopathic Sammy (Bell), and invites him to remain in Spain and work as his driver. Frankie discovers that they are in fact the \\"Peckham Four\\", wanted for armed robbery back in Britain. However, Frankie decides he prefers an exciting life of sun, drugs, women, money, fast cars, designer clothes, and a reputation, as opposed to being a nobody back in London. Frankie soon accepts and becomes involved in the business of smuggling cannabis across the Strait of Gibraltar from Morocco, in which children are used although the children are sometimes shot dead by the Spanish Navy patrolmen. The film then follows the rise-and-fall pattern common to many gangster films, showing first the criminals living the high life as their cannabis trade is booming, and then the downfall as greed and paranoia (not helped by the obvious attraction between Frankie and Sammy's beautiful trophy wife Carly) introduce conflict between them, and eventually split them up. Charlie and Frankie decide to go into business alone, importing cocaine instead of cannabis through drop-offs from Colombian aeroplanes, but this is the cause of the final problem. Not only do they both become increasingly addicted to the drug itself, but also the local mayor, who had been happy to ignore the cannabis trade but had warned them not to import cocaine, discovers what they are doing and uses the weight of the law to shut them down and close their businesses. An assassination attempt on the mayor's life ends in failure, and the gruesome beheading of one of the gang. Six months later Frankie and Charlie are homeless thugs, reduced to stealing in order to survive. While organising a disappointing reunion party at Charlie's old bar (which Frankie's former heroin addicted friend Sonny is now running), Frankie meets the scheming Carly again and decides to make one last deal. He invites Sammy in on a pick-up, but while both intend to betray the other, Carly has given Sammy a pistol with an empty clip. Sammy tries to shoot Frankie, who in turn attacks him with a rock. The fight ends abruptly as Spanish Navy patrolmen's gunfire fatally shoots Sammy. Frankie escapes through a sewage pipe. Frankie emerges from the sewer to meet Carly, who had masterminded the whole thing, finally getting his happy ending. But at the last minute, he realises he can't trust Carly when he finds another pistol in her handbag amongst their money, so he knocks her out and drives off triumphantly into the sunset on his own. The ending reveals that Sonny cleaned up his act and continued to run Charlie's old bar, which he did so successfully, whilst Charlie was reduced to working on the door. The theatrical ending also reveals that \\"Carly went back to her parent's house in Penge\\", \\"Sammy went to Hell\\" and \\"Frankie went to Hollywood\\".

The programme was also surprisingly comprehensive - in its first year the festival was dedicated mainly to anime, but it later became much more international. Perhaps reflecting its focus, WFAC has presented more animated feature films in public exhibition than any other festival in the world. One interesting development since 2003 was the festival's Tidbits programme, developed to search out and promote the creation of feature films by one single artist or very small groups, made possible by advancements in technology.

He was a leading figure in the Darien scheme, a failed Scottish attempt to colonise the Isthmus of Panama in the late 1690s. During the War of the Spanish Succession he was an early proponent of the idea that Great Britain should take New France, proposing in 1708 that it be conquered and that the residents of Acadia be deported. (The latter idea would acted on during the Seven Years' War of the 1750s.) He was the grandfather of Samuel Bayard. Early life Samuel Vetch was born in Edinburgh, Scotland on 9 December 1668, and was baptised in the Church of Scotland the next day. His father, William Veitch, was a politically active Presbyterian minister. He and his wife Marion Fairley had a number of children, of whom Samuel was the second.Waller, pp. 4‚Äì7 Veitch was arrested in the hysteria surrounding the Popish Plot in the late 1670s, but was released.Waller, pp. 7‚Äì8 The family harboured the Duke of Argyll, who was sought for his refusal to take oaths prescribed by the Test Act, and Veitch became involved in the Scottish conspiracy contributing to the Monmouth Rebellion. When that failed, Veitch went into hiding, and eventually fled to the Dutch Republic, where he was joined in 1683 by his two oldest sons, William Jr. and Samuel.Waller, p. 9 The boys studied for the ministry at Utrecht, but neither was interested in pursuing that career. Both became supporters of William of Orange, and Samuel was probably in a regiment of Scottish supporters in the 1688 Glorious Revolution that brought William III and Mary II to power in England.Waller, pp. 11‚Äì12 Career He was then commissioned a cornet in the Royal Regiment of Scots Dragoons, \\"though very young\\", at the age of 20. The regiment was sent back to the Netherlands, where it fought in the Nine Years' War. Vetch was wounded at Steinkirk and was also in battle at Landen. By the end of the war he had been promoted to captain.Waller, p. 12 =Colonial ventures and business= In 1698 Vetch and his brother William joined a Scottish attempt spearheaded by William Paterson to establish a colony on the Isthmus of Panama. The \\"Darien scheme\\" failed due to political infighting in the colony, diseases, lack of support, and Spanish hostility.Plank, p. 42 Vetch was elected to the colonial council, and was one of the survivors (many of the 1,200 colonists sent to Central America, including William Vetch, succumbed to disease) to make his way to New York City in August 1699.Brown, pp. 26‚Äì27 Vetch formed connections with the politically powerful Livingston family, marrying Margaret, the daughter of Robert Livingston.Hess, p. 84 With the Livingstons Vetch then established a highly profitable but illegal trade with New France, and eventually settled in Boston, capital of the Province of Massachusetts Bay.Plank, p. 44 Although he curtailed his trading activities when Queen Anne's War began in 1702, he was given a renewed opportunity for trade after Massachusetts Governor Joseph Dudley sent him on a diplomatic mission to Quebec in 1705 as part of an embassy to recover prisoners taken in a 1704 raid on Deerfield, Massachusetts. The embassy was a success, and Dudley permitted Vetch to make a trading voyage to New France in 1705. He was spotted upon his return, and the outcry compelled Dudley to have him put on trial and convicted in 1706 for trading with the enemy. He then sailed to England to appeal his conviction, and to lobby for military action against New France. Using his knowledge of New France, Vetch proposed to Queen Anne the conquest of all of New France. His proposals included the deportation of the Acadian people to the West Indies so that Nova Scotia could be peopled by Protestant settlers.Grenier, pp. 17‚Äì18 With the support of political allies and sympathetic colonial governors, the queen gave Vetch a military commission and promised him a governorship and military support for the 1709 campaign season. Along with Francis Nicholson, Vetch travelled to Boston in 1709 to raise colonial militia and supplies. However, the promised military force never arrived (having been diverted to the European theatre of the War of the Spanish Succession), and the effort collapsed. Nicholson immediately returned to London, and secured a new promise of support for 1710. =Governor of Nova Scotia= The 1710 expedition succeeded in capturing the Acadian capital of Port Royal, although little of the surrounding countryside was pacified. Vetch was named the first governor of Nova Scotia, and the town was renamed Annapolis Royal in honour of the queen. The garrison that was left there was woefully undersupplied, and Vetch apparently funded at least some of its expenses, although he did get some official assistance from Massachusetts. However, some of his underlings also complained that he was grossly mismanaging the affairs of the colony. Nicholson capitalised on these complaints to have himself appointed governor in Vetch's place in 1713. =Later years= Vetch then returned to England to recover his reputation and his lost funds. With the accession of George I to the throne, he succeeded, and was reappointed governor in 1715. However, he never returned to North America, as he was called on to advise on matters of North American trade and politics. He was formally replaced as governor in 1717 by Richard Philipps, and spent his remaining years in unsuccessful attempts to recoup his expenses and acquire other colonial postings. Personal life In 1700, Vetch married Margaret Livingston (1681‚Äì1758), the daughter of Robert Livingston and Alida Schuyler Van Rensselaer. Together, they had: * Alida Vetch (b. 1705), who married Stephen Bayard (1700‚Äì1757), scion of another prominent New York family.Hess, pp. 91, 274, 625 He died in King's Bench Prison, where he had been sent because of his debts, in 1732. He was buried at St. George's in Southwark. =Descendants= His grandchildren were William Bayard (1729‚Äì1804) and Harriet Elizabeth Bayard Van Rensselaer (1799‚Äì1875). =Honors= There is a memorial plaque to Vetch at the Fort Anne National Historic Site in Annapolis Royal.

B. Jackson, (September 25, 1909 ‚Äì August 28, 1996) was a writer, publisher, instructor, and sketch artist in landscape design. Herbert Muschamp, architecture critic of the New York Times, stated that J. B. Jackson was \\"America's greatest living writer on the forces that have shaped the land this nation occupies.\\" He was influential in broadening the perspective on the \\"vernacular\\" landscape. Early life Brinck was born on September 25, 1909 in Dinard, France to American parents. Jackson spent his early school years with them in Washington, D.C., and in Europe. In 1923, at age 14, he was enrolled at the elite Institut Le Rosey in Rolle, Switzerland, where he became fluent in both French and German. He savored an environment of mountains, meadows, and forests, but also absorbed the human face of the Swiss cities and cantons. He would later draw upon his travels abroad in writings, sketches, and watercolors. He attended preparatory schools in New England and spent summers on his uncle's farm in New Mexico.\\"John Brinckerhoff Jackson,\\" American National Biography Online, consulted July 23, 2009 Jackson's experiences in college were influential in his approach to the shaping of the landscape. He attended the Experimental College of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. Jackson gained an insight into architecture and planning from the social criticism of Lewis Mumford and Oswald Spengler's revelation in Decline of the West that \\"landscapes reflected the culture of the people that were living there.\\" In 1929, Jackson entered Harvard. His instructor Irving Babbitt was influential in Jackson's opposition to modernism. Jackson's taste for Baroque style and history began to blossom at this time. He believed that the zest of the Baroque style was the essence of the connection between humankind and nature. While attending Harvard, Jackson wrote articles for the Harvard Advocate. His career of writing about the landscape began here. Career Following graduation from Harvard in 1932, Jackson took courses in architecture, writing, and drawing. Each would later serve as the bases for essays, lectures, and articles for his magazine, Landscape. He wandered through Europe in 1934 to 1935 studying Baroque style. While in Europe, Jackson began to write articles critical of Nazism and published them in The American Review and Harper's. His interest in politics began to be expressed in his works. During the mid-1930s, Jackson published essays in American literary magazines and a novel, with his photograph that appeared on the cover of a 1938 ‚ÄòSaturday Review‚Äô. In 1938, his novel, titled Saints in Summertime, was published. The book revealed the infiltration of Nazism and the soldiers' attraction to energy emanating from power. =Military service= After briefly trying his hand at ranching in New Mexico, Jackson enlisted in the army, in 1940. As an officer during war, he studied books to gain insight on the geography of the location. He deciphered code, studied maps, and learned the terrain. He read books by French geographers‚ÄîPierre Deffontaines, Paul Vidal de la Blache, and Albert Demangeon. It was at this time that he developed his interpretation that the shaping and devastation of the landscape came from the necessities for human existence. Jackson believed that human history brought about human geography. The landscape was the product of humankind's effort to \\"recreate heaven on earth\\". As the war ended, Jackson began to contemplate publishing a magazine of geography. =Landscape magazine= In the spring of 1951, he published the first issue of Landscape, with the subtitle \\"Human Geography of the Southwest;\\" this was later dropped. Jackson served as the magazine's publisher and editor until 1968. At first, Jackson argued, quite literally, for a lofty ‚Äì an airborne ‚Äì view of the world, reveling in the perspective of aerial photographs. But Jackson's work, which dominated the first five issues of the magazine, was grounded in what he would later call the vernacular: an interest in the commonplace or everyday landscape. Jackson expressed an innate confidence in the ability of people of small means to make significant changes in their surroundings. In an opening essay, The Need of Being Versed in Country Things, Jackson states that \\"It is from the air that the true relationship between the natural and the human landscape is first clearly revealed. The peaks and canyons lose much of their impressiveness when seen from above. What catches our eye and arouses our interest is not the sandy washes and the naked rocks, but the evidences of man.\\" His writings allowed him to raise questions and present controversial statements especially in reference to humans and their role in shaping the landscape. Jackson's collected essays have been published in seven books, in addition to A Sense of Place, a Sense of Time, which won the 1995 PEN prize for essays. =Teaching= Jackson was influential in the lives of many students, colleagues, admirers, and friends. He taught landscape history courses as adjunct professor at Harvard University's Graduate School of Design beginning in 1969 and at the College of Environmental Design and the Department of Geography at the University of California, Berkeley. He ended teaching classes in the late 1970s. Since then he has given lectures, especially on themes pertaining to urban issues. Jackson states that \\"We are not spectators; all human landscape is not a work of art.\\" He felt strongly that the purpose of landscape is to provide a place for living and working and leisure. The Association of American Geographers established a Jackson Prize, to \\"reward American geographers who write books about the United States which convey the insights of professional geography in language that is interesting and attractive to a lay audience.\\" =Cultural Landscapes Studies= As a scholar, historian and writer, John B. Jackson greatly influenced the development and trajectory of contemporary cultural landscape studies in America. In the introduction to Everyday America: Cultural Landscape Studies after J.B. Jackson (2003), editors Chris Wilson and Paul Groth note that the term 'cultural landscape' rarely appeared in print prior to the 1950s. But between 1959 and 1990, they note, writers across disciplines have come to realize the importance of the built environment. > \\"More surprising,\\" they claim, \\"was the discovery of everyday built spaces > as significant evidence of social groups, power relations and culture by > historians, American studies scholars, literary critics, and a growing > number of anthropologists, sociologists and social theorists.\\" It is a \\"way > of thinking,\\" they continue, with \\"inherent contradictions and multiple > approaches.\\"\\"Introduction,\\" Everyday America: Cultural Landscape Studies > after J.B. Jackson (2003), ed. Chris Wilson and Paul Groth The history of landscape study and, more broadly, place and regional studies, illustrates the convergences with some of the histories here, both across discipline and nation. In the United States a popular fascination with vibrant architecture, communities, and landscapes of everyday America has been expressed by writers ranging from Walt Whitman to Mark Twain, and by painter Winslow Homer through early-twentieth artists of common landscapes. The New Deal writers and painters explored a strong regionalist theme, which was also connected to the architectural and urban criticism of Lewis Mumford. The concern for environmental degradation caused by human activities was another American theme, spurred particularly by the Vermont writer George Perkins Marsh. Comparison of American trends to cultural landscape studies in other places is illuminating. Wilson and Groth write that German cultural landscape studies were primarily based on scientific categorizations of regions and settlements, with strong cross-disciplinary ties to geology and economic analysis. Historical accounts of landscape influenced British cultural studies, but the study of cultural landscapes also was strongly based on field observation and map interpretations. In France, the emphasis on unique culture and geography shaped the field, especially in ideas of genre de vie (ways of life) and pays (social regions), ideas that have had particular resonance in American landscape studies. \\"By World War II,\\" the editors remark, \\"each French region had its own well-written guidebooks to local physical and social landscapes\\" (4). Geographer Carl Sauer, who had studied in Germany and had long tenure as the chair of the Geography department at Berkeley, in 1925 wrote the now classic definition of a cultural landscape: \\"The cultural landscape is fashioned from the natural landscape by a cultural group. Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, and cultural landscape is the result.\\" Personal life During the height of his career, Jackson lived just southwest of Santa Fe, New Mexico, near an historic property known as El Rancho de las Golondrinas (The Ranch of the Swallows).

Their style draws from psychedelic trance, house music and breakbeat, along with other diverse influences. History Formed in 1992 in Tampa, Florida, the group consisted of performer/singer Bunny and producer David Christophere. After several singles released on Monk and David Christophere's Hallucination Recordings label under the name Anarch-E, their first success as producers came in 1993 with the release of the \\"Phases of an Out of Body Experience\\" single on Hardkiss Records. As remixers, Rabbit in the Moon has reworked songs by artists such as Garbage (\\"Queer\\" and \\"Milk\\"), Tori Amos (\\"Precious Things\\"), Sarah McLachlan (\\"Fear\\", \\"Possession\\"), Orbital (\\"Are We Here?\\"), Smashing Pumpkins (\\"The End Is the Beginning Is the End\\"), Goldie (\\"Inner City Life\\"), White Zombie (\\"Blood, Milk and Sky\\") and Delerium (\\"Euphoria\\"). Rabbit in the Moon has also collaborated with Humate and in 1994 they released the Hemispheres E.P. Throughout their career, Rabbit in the Moon toured extensively in the United States playing shows at venues and raves. The Rabbit in the Moon Remixes Volume 2 CD came with a liner note stating that there was a new album to be released in summer of 2001. The album never materialized. Because of Monk's departure, questions were raised as to whether the band was breaking up, but this was not the case. = DJ Monk leaves = DJ Monk left the group in 2002. A new song called \\"Time Bomb\\" surfaced in 2003, with David Christophere and Bunny as the only producers on the track. In 2005, they made the song \\"Came and Conkered\\", inspired by and featured in the soundtrack of the 2005 video game Conker: Live & Reloaded. They were asked by Nile Rodgers to create music for the Xbox remake of the game. Early in 2007, a countdown to a new album appeared on the band's MySpace page, putting the release date in April 2007. The album was ultimately released on July 10, 2007. It features two discs: one, a collection of past singles and newer material in audio CD format; the other, a collection of music videos and live performances from various festivals and concerts in DVD format. The record is called \\"Decade\\", and was released on Contagious Musiq / Southbeat Records.Rabbit in the Moon Decade CD In 2008, on the second night of the Annual World DJ Festival in Seoul, South Korea, frontman Bunny was injured when a glass bottle thrown by someone in the crowd hit his left eye, lacerating his retina, lens, and skin, and severely damaging his vision. Friends and fans throughout the electronic dance music community rallied to raise money to help him pay for his medical expenses.Nearly Blinded by Crowd Injury, Community Rallies to Help RITM‚Äôs Bunny, by Zel McCarthy, Big Shot Magazine, September 3, 2008 , Rabbit in the Moon announced on their MySpace page that they were working on a new double album. On March 27, 2010, Rabbit in the Moon performed at the Ultra Music Festival in Miami. David Christophere was not seen at this show, fueling rumors he left the band and of an imminent band break up. David Christophere's last Rabbit in the Moon show was New Year's Eve 2009. The two have not performed a show together since. Bunny has been performing in several countries under the title BUNNY or Bunny Live. David Christophere produces music and DJ from his home base in Los Angeles. = Reunion = On August 31, 2013, the group played Firestone Live in Orlando, FL. On December 16, 2015, Ultra Music Festival in Miami announced on their lineup of 2016 edition the appearance of Rabbit in the Moon. The group performed at Electric Daisy Carnival in Orlando in November, 2016. The group played at Ultra Music Festival Miami 2017 and 2018. As well as Ultra Korea, Insomniac Countdown , Freaknight Seattle, and the great salt air Utah Das Energi festival.

Such proteins are referred to as virokines if they resemble cytokines, growth factors, or complement regulators; the term viroceptor is sometimes used if the proteins resemble cellular receptors. A third class of virally encoded immunomodulatory proteins consists of proteins that bind directly to cytokines. Due to the immunomodulatory properties of these proteins, they have been proposed as potentially therapeutically relevant to autoimmune diseases. Mechanism The primary mechanism of virokine interference with immune signaling is thought to be competitive inhibition of the binding of host signaling molecules to their target receptors. Virokines occupy binding sites on host receptors, thereby inhibiting access by signaling molecules. Viroceptors mimic host receptors and thus divert signaling molecules from finding their targets. Cytokine-binding proteins bind to and sequester cytokines, occluding the binding surface through which they interact with receptors. The effect is to attenuate and subvert host immune response. Discovery The term \\"virokine\\" was coined by National Institutes of Health virologist Bernard Moss. The early 1990s saw several reports of virally encoded proteins with sequence homology to immune proteins, followed by reports of the cowpox and vaccinia viruses directly interfering with key immune regulator IL1B. The first identified virokine was an epidermal growth factor-like protein found in myxoma viruses. Much of the early work on virokines involved vaccinia virus, which was discovered to secrete proteins that promote proliferation of neighboring cells and block complement immune activity leading to inflammation. Evolutionary origins The immunomodulatory proteins, including virokines, in the poxvirus family have been extensively studied in the context of the evolution of the family. Virokines in this family are thought to have been acquired from host genes and from other viruses through horizontal gene transfer. Similar observations have been made in the herpesvirus family; for example, Epstein-Barr virus encodes an interleukin protein with high sequence identity to the human interleukin-10, suggesting a recent evolutionary origin.

He is first mentioned in the year 313 BC, when he was left by his brother in the command of Chalcis, to make headway against Ptolemy, the general of Antigonus, when Cassander himself was recalled to the defence of Macedonia. Again, in 302 BC, when the general coalition was formed against Antigonus, Pleistarchus was sent forward by his brother, with an army 12,000 foot and 500 horse, to join Lysimachus in Asia. As the Hellespont and entrance of the Euxine was occupied by Demetrius, he endeavoured to transport his troops from Odessus direct to Heraclea, but lost by far the greater part on the passage, some having been captured by the enemy's ships, while others perished in a storm, in which Pleistarchus himself narrowly escaped shipwreck. Notwithstanding this misfortune, he seems to have rendered efficient service to the confederates, for which he was rewarded after the battle of Ipsus (301 BC) by obtaining the province of Cilicia, as an independent government. This, however, he did not long retain, being expelled from it in the following year by Demetrius, almost without opposition. Afterwards he is recorded in inscriptions as the ruler of Caria; he was apparently given this province after the battle of Ipsus, and ruled there for at least seven years. Pausanias mentions him as having been defeated by the Athenians in an action in which he commanded the cavalry and auxiliaries of Cassander; but the period at which this event took place is uncertain. It is perhaps to him that the medical writer, Diocles of Carystus, addressed his work, which is cited more than once by Athenaeus, as œÑŒ± œÄœÅŒøœÇ Œ†ŒªŒµŒπœÉœÑŒ±œÅœáŒøŒΩ Œ•Œ≥ŒπŒµŒπŒΩŒ±.

The ILO view social partnership as \\"all types of negotiation, consultation or simply exchange of information between, or among, representatives of governments, employers and workers, on issues of common interest relating to economic and social policy\\" () is the term used for the tripartite, triennial national pay agreements reached in Ireland. The process was initiated in 1987, following a period of high inflation and weak economic growth which led to increased emigration and unsustainable government borrowing and national debt. Strike and wage moderation were important outcomes of the agreements, and this has been seen as a significant contributor to the 'Celtic Tiger' phenomenon. Prior to this, agreement bargaining had been on a local level since 1981; in the previous decade national employer-union deals and 'National Understandings' were the norm, but came under increased pressure. The corporatist 'social partnership' agreements are agreed between the Government, the main employer groups Irish Business and Employers Confederation (IBEC) and the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) and the trade unions (members of the Irish Congress of Trades Unions); since 1997 voluntary/community organisations have taken part in the general policy discussions but not in the key wage bargaining element. The corporatist core has been a trade-off of modest wage increases in exchange for a lighter income tax burden. There are also sectoral reforms negotiated and public service pay reviews under the rubric of 'benchmarking' with private sector pay scales. Past agreements The current agreement, that has been in place since 2005, is Towards 2016 (T2016), the past agreements are: * 1987‚Äì1990 ‚Äì Programme for National Recovery (PNR) * 1991‚Äì1994 ‚Äì Programme for Economic and Social Progress (PESP) * 1994‚Äì1996 ‚Äì Programme for Competitiveness and Work (PCW) * 1997‚Äì2000 ‚Äì Partnership 2000, for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness (P2000) * 2000‚Äì2003 ‚Äì Programme for Prosperity and Fairness (PPF) * 2003‚Äì2005 ‚Äì Sustaining Progress (SP) =Sustaining Progress= Sustaining Progress operated from January 2003 to December 2005, setting centralised, national wage increases, and providing for policy agreements over welfare, education, health and employment issues. It was the sixth of the series of neo-corporatist agreements since 1987 with the national wage agreement details negotiated in two separate tranches broadly covering 2003‚Äì4 and 2005-6. Its core participants were: (1) the Government through the Department of the Taoiseach (Prime Minister's Office); (2) the main employers' unions which are the Irish Business and Employers Confederation (IBEC) and the Construction Industry Federation (CIF); and (3) the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) which is the umbrella body for over 40 trades unions representing around 550,000 members coming from all over the country. They account for about one-third of the number of employees in the state. Towards 2016 The seventh social partnership agreement, titled Towards 2016 was concluded in June 2006 with pay terms due to run to early 2008. These provide for cumulative wage increases set at 10.4pc over a 27-month period with minor adjustments for those earning less than ‚Ç¨400 a week. The pay and policy pact also includes increased enforcement measures for employment protection and compliance with established labour standards. Its aspirational social and welfare provisions are built around a loose ten-year social democratic-style commitment towards improved provision of welfare and state services. The trades unions, through the Irish Congress of Trades Unions, voted in early September 2006, by 242 to 84 votes, to accept the agreement with its largest nursing (INO) and retail (Mandate) unions opting not to participate in the vote. On the same day the IBEC employers' union also announced its acceptance of \\"Towards 2016\\". The second stage of \\"Towards 2016\\" pay terms were agreed in September 2008 and accepted in an ICTU delegate ballot by 305 votes in favour to 36 against in November. Unions which had previously opposed or abstained from the pay agreements adopted a much more supportive stance in the face of rapidly rising unemployment and deteriorating public finances. Unite, the British-based amalgamation of the ATGWU and Amicus trades unions, provided the main opposition. The second stage pay terms provided a 6% pay increase over a 21-month period, payable in two stages, following a three-month pay freeze in the private sector and an 11-month pay freeze in the public service. The terms were accepted by IBEC, the main employers' union, on the same day but the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) withheld consent as it had sought a 12-month pay freeze for employees in construction. The terms also include an additional 0.5% wage rise for those earning less than ‚Ç¨11 an hour and maintains the inability-to-pay provisions for companies in financial or trading difficulties. Partnership collapse Concern at exchequer deficits of over ‚Ç¨20 billion, resulting from the collapse of the construction speculative bubble, dominated political discourse and over two decades of social corporatism was continuously questioned during 2009. Increasing unemployment‚Äîrising from 4% to 12% in two years‚Äîfuelled public questioning of pay rates in the public sector and its allied security of employment, compared with the pay freezes and increased redundancies experienced in the private sector. The second stage pay terms, described as a 'transition agreement', effectively collapsed at the end of 2009 when the Government imposed income cuts of between 5% and 8% for about 315,000 public servants in its Budget. Belated attempts by the ICTU public service committee to offer efficiencies and flexibility in public service work practices, allied to a vague proposal for 12 days unpaid leave to be taken by all public servants during 2010, failed to secure either political or public support or prevent the income reductions. Nine months earlier (March 2009) the Fianna F√°il/Green Party coalition government had imposed a 5% 'pension levy' on public service earnings to 'compensate' for the earnings-related defined benefit pensions enjoyed by public service employees. In June 2009 the government and IBEC failed to secure agreement with ICTU to amend the transition pay terms to reflect the impact of an economic depression and deflation in consumer prices. At the end of December 2009 the main employer body, IBEC, formally withdrew from the terms of the transition agreement having failed to agree a suspension of the pay terms with ICTU. It stated that \\"we are entering a period of enterprise level bargaining in unionised employments\\". [Industrial Relations News, issue No.1, January 2010, page 3]. Following 23 years of social partnership the Irish trades unions (ICTU) entered the new decade seriously weakened and with union employee density down to 31% compared to a density highpoint of 62% in the early 1980s preceding the series of seven corporatist social pacts.https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2010/0125/1224263036028.html Union penetration is highly imbalanced with a density approaching 80% in the public sector and around 20% in the larger private sector. Union members are now more likely to be over 45, married with children, Irish-born with third- level qualifications and working in semi-professional occupations, especially in the health, education or public administration sectors, rather than the traditional image of being lower-paid vulnerable, low-skill workers.http://www.cso.ie/releasespublications/documents/labour_market/current/qnhsunionmembership.pdf Instead of reviving the Christian-democratic form of corporatism which dominated Ireland's social partnership, ICTU leaders renewed their proposals for a social-democratic arrangement modelled on some Nordic states welfare systems. The trades unions lack the political influence to develop a social- democratic political force while the current Irish government is suggesting a form of 'social dialogue' to replace the more rigid 'social partnership' arrangements. In March 2010, under the banner of \\"social dialogue\\", the ICTU public service unions and the Government negotiated a three-year pay-freeze and the potential claw-back of some of the imposed pay-cuts in return for verified efficiencies and increased flexible working rosters and mobility of up to 45 km between workplaces. It also included an accord on reviewing any decisions to outsource some aspects of public services to ensure value-for- money. Unlike earlier \\"social partnership\\" procedures the main private sector employer bodies were not involved and the negotiations were facilitated by the state Labour Relations Commission (LRC).

Rose (1913‚Äì1991) was a prominent landscape architect and author of the twentieth century. Born in rural Pennsylvania he, his mother and older sister moved to New York after his father's death. Rose was a high school dropout, but this didn't stop him from being accepted into Cornell University as an architecture student. Later he transferred to Harvard University as a landscape architecture major. In 1937, he was expelled because his design style didn't fit into Harvard's program. In 1938 and 1939 Rose published a series of articles containing the design experiment ideas that led to his expulsion from Harvard. He later published numerous articles and books which heavily impacted design theory and practice in the twentieth century. In 1941, Rose worked for Tuttle, Seelye, Place and Raymond in New York where he became discouraged by the limitations of large public works, and decided that working on private gardens was more suiting to his style. Despite his dislike of the institution of school, Rose would often make appearances as a guest lecturer at schools of landscape architecture and architecture. Before his death he was able to fulfill his lifelong dream of establishing a design study and landscape research center, The James Rose Center. After Rose's death from cancer in 1991, he bequeathed his home in Ridgewood to the James Rose Center.  Designs and influences  One of Rose's first major works while employed at Tuttle, Seelye, Place and Raymond was to design a staging area to house 30,000 men at Camp Kilmer in New Jersey. After this experience, Rose turned his focus to working on private gardens that created an intimate relationship between human beings, nature, and architecture. His designs also created a fusion of indoor and outdoor space. Most of Rose's later works were greatly influenced by the Japanese garden style; he even adopted the religion of Zen Buddhism. The time Rose spent in Okinawa during World War II and his many subsequent visits to Japan, nurtured his fondness for Japanese gardens. Except for his home in Ridgewood not much of Rose's later works were documented because of his spontaneous design method. His designs were always open to improvisations; they were never finished and continuously transforming form one stage to another. His designs, like his home in Ridgewood, were works in progress. Rose applied a common theory to his designs and described them as ‚Äúneither landscape nor architecture, but both; neither indoors, nor outdoors, but both.‚Äù Ridgewood is Rose's most documented design and is a clear example of his theories and how he applied them to his designs.  Social movements  James C. Rose was one of the pioneers of modernism in landscape architecture. While attending Harvard, Rose and his classmates, Garrett Eckbo and Dan Kiley, rebelled against the conventional landscape theory and designs. He refused to conform to the formal style of Beaux-Arts architecture; he saw the landscapes as much more than a pastoral setting for modern buildings. Rose and his classmates fueled the social movement of modernism in Landscape architecture. They teamed up to write several articles about their cause. Through these publications in the Pencil Point magazine, now called Progressive Architecture, and other later articles and books, Rose was able to spread his view on landscape theory and design. Rose also took a stand against the emerging American suburbia and urban planning. He believed these ordered, inorganic projects were useless for domestic living and were degrading to the environment. Rose wrote about suburbia and urban planning in his first book Creative Gardens and also in several published articles.  Impact on landscape architecture  James C. Rose's greatest impact on landscape architecture was as a catalyst for the modernism movement. His influence was spread to the populace because of the emerging power of the media. The designs he created, though wonderful and expressive of his design theories, had less of an influence on landscape architecture than the many books and articles he wrote.

The U.S. division is headquartered in Radnor, Pennsylvania. VWR ranked #91 in 2006, and #77 in 2005, in Forbes list of largest American private companies. Suppliers include Applied Scientific, 3B Scientific Duracell, Kimberly-Clark, Bel-Art Products, and Welch Allyn. VWR primarily serves the government, biotechnology, life science, education, electronics and pharmaceutical sectors. In 2010, the company maintained operations in 25 countries and processed approximately 50,000 order lines daily from a logistical network, which includes 25 strategically located distribution centers.  History  VWR was formed in the late 1920s by George Van Waters and Nat Rogers as a small chemical company. Since then, the company evolved to focus on the laboratory market. It also has a presence in the cleanroom, safety, and clinical markets. VWR owns a group of companies under the unofficial umbrella \\"VWR Education.\\" These companies include Science Kit and Boreal Laboratories and Edmund Scientific Corporation. In August 1989, VWR purchased Wards's Science and Sargent-Welch Scientific Company. In September, 1995, VWR completed their purchase of Baxter's Industrial division, creating a much larger company. The capital was primarily obtained from Merck KGaA, a German chemical manufacturer (known as EMD Chemicals in the U.S. and Canada) who later purchased VWR and merged them with Merck Eurolab, creating a global laboratory distributor. In 2004, VWR became a limited partnership controlled by investment firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice. In 2007, CD&R; sold VWR to another private equity company, Madison Dearborn Partners. In 2010, VWR moved its world headquarters to Radnor, Pennsylvania. On June 1, 2011 VWR International acquired BioExpress Corp (formerly ISC BioExpress), raising concerns of monopolization of the laboratory supplies sector along with Thermo Fisher Scientific. Controversy has arisen about a 2010 decision by VWR to close its unionized Brisbane, CA distribution center, moving operations to a non-unionized Visalia, CA facility. This facility has now voted in the union for equal pay for equal work. They pay the Material Handlers $10 an hour when the other distribution centers start at a much higher rate. VWR will not allow this facility to be unionized and will not work out a contract. On October 2, 2014, VWR's IPO raised $536 million, valuing the value of the company at close to $5 billion. In January 2016, VWR acquired Therapak Corporation, an assembler and distributor of medical convenience kits with locations in Claremont, CA, Buford, GA, Hayes, UK and Skalice, CZ. In April 2017, VWR acquired MESM Ltd., a provider of laboratory and medical equipment and supplies for use in clinical trials worldwide . VWR acquired two other companies earlier in the year, EPL Archives and Seastar Chemicals On May 5, 2017, it was announced that Avantor, a Center Valley, Pa.-based supplier of ultra-high-purity materials to the life sciences and advanced technology industries, would acquire VWR for $33.25 in cash per share of VWR common stock, reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $6.4 billion. On November 21, 2017, Avantor completed its acquisition of VWR. As of June 2020, Avantor was included in the Fortune500 list, ranking 484 on the list of the largest U.S companies by revenue.

The novel concerns such modern themes as violence and restlessness of new age youth in the paranoia of the nuclear age. Plot summary In the novel, the father of a mentally ill child meets another parent of another disabled child, who is known throughout the book as \\"Mori's Father\\". Mori's Father tells the narrator of a chain of surrealistic incidents that happened to him and his son Mori. It seems that an alien supreme being or force has enabled Mori and his father to undergo a transformation, via which a 38-year-old father became 18 years old and an 8-year-old mentally disabled child became a 28-year-old fully intelligent person. (There is some logic to the arithmetic that 38-20=18 and 8+20=28.) It seems Mori and his father have undertaken a mission to assassinate a certain Patron, who is manipulating and clashing two opposing youth groups, so that one of them may create a \\"dirty\\" nuclear bomb, threatening Tokyo and more, and thus place power into Patron's hands.

The line was previously owned by the Lackawaxen-Honesdale Shippers Association and operated under contract by Robey Railroads. The operation was contracted to the Morristown & Erie Railway in January 2009; service ended in 2011. Service was resumed by the Delaware, Lackawaxen & Stourbridge Railroad (DL&S;) on May 9, 2015. Early history The railroad traces its beginnings to the Delaware & Hudson Canal transporting barges of coal up from Pennsylvania and destined for the Hudson River and eventually the ports of New York City. A gravity railroad was built to carry coal over the mountains from Carbondale to Honesdale in 1829. Coal would be transferred from train to canal boat at Honesdale. The Stourbridge Lions first run, as depicted by Clyde Osmer DeLand c. 1916 Seeking to haul greater amounts, the idea of steam-powered locomotion was proposed. The leaders in steam technology at the time were in Great Britain, and so three engines were ordered and delivered to America. According to the Wayne County Chamber of Commerce, this is the site of \\"the first commercial locomotive on rails in the western hemisphere\\" took place on August 8, 1829. The locomotive was the Stourbridge Lion. A replica of the Stourbridge Lion steam engine is on display in Honesdale to this day. Both the gravity railroad and the canal were shut down by 1898, and the D&H; left to pursue other transportation activities. Erie Railroad era In 1860, the Pennsylvania Coal Company began the construction of a 16-mile-long railroad from Hawley, Pennsylvania, to a connection with the Erie Railroad at Lackawaxen. This new line was quickly leased to the Erie Railroad, and it was operated as their Hawley Branch. In 1868 the charter of the Jefferson Railroad was reactivated and construction progressed from Hawley towards Honesdale, hoping to reach Carbondale. This extension would never be built, even after the Erie took over in 1870. It would continue operation as the Honesdale Branch, and coal was the primary traffic. Coal traffic declined through the 1930s, but new local business took its place, warranting a five-day-a-week operation. In 1960 the Erie merged with the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad (EL). Traffic on the branch remained steady at about 3,000 cars per year. Hurricane Agnes hit the East on June 22, 1972. After estimating that the damage to EL, principally between Binghamton and Salamanca, New York, amounted to $2 million ($ today), EL filed for bankruptcy on June 26, 1972.Moody's Transportation Manual, 1986, p. 1275 During the reorganization of the eastern railroads, it was thought that EL might be able to reorganize on its own, and there was a proposal by Chessie System to buy a portion of the EL. However, operating unions could not reach a compromise, and Chessie canceled the agreement. Also, by 1975, the economy in the eastern United States was affected by the 1973 oil crisis, hurting any hopes of EL being able to independently compete with government-rehabilitated Conrail lines. Not surprisingly, EL asked to be included in Conrail. Due to the low density of traffic, the Honesdale Branch would not be included. Wayne County then made plans to purchase the line from EL to avoid abandonment. Lackawaxen & Stourbridge Proposals for short line operation were solicited from the Delaware Otsego Corporation, Rail Service Associates (operators of the Bath & Hammondsport Railroad), and TransAction Associates. Rail Service Associates (RSA) formed the Delaware, Lackawaxen & Western Railroad to take over the branch, and began its feasibility study. Early negotiations for subsidy came with the requirement that former union employees be made an offer for work at their current salary and benefit levels. Discussions with Conrail over rate divisions did not end favorably. In March 1976, with less than a month to go before the start up of Conrail, RSA pulled out of their proposal. An inquiry was made with Delaware Otsego (DO) to see if they were still interested in operating the line. Building off their recent success with the launch of the Central New York Railroad and the revival of the Fonda, Johnstown and Gloversville Railroad (FJ&G;), DO was confident the Honesdale Branch would be profitable. With two weeks until the deadline, DO formed the Lackawaxen & Stourbridge Railroad (LASB). A spare locomotive from the FJ&G; was shipped down to Lackawaxen in anticipation of the start-up. The ownership of the tracks was still in question, so an emergency order was handed down by the ICC directing LASB to operate the branch after March 30, 1976. The first LASB train departed from Lackawaxen on April 1, 1976. The railroad's first blow was the loss of the local Agway mill in Honesdale. The railroad was purchased from the estate of EL by the Lackawaxen-Honesdale Shippers Association (LHSA) in 1977, with operation contracted to DO. In 1979, the Wayne County Chamber of Commerce launched seasonal passenger excursions. After DO In June 1989 DO ended operations on LASB. The Stourbridge Railroad assumed operations through contract to Robey Railroads, operators of the North Shore Railroad. Seasonal passenger excursions continued to run, sponsored by Wayne County. Ownership of the line was conveyed from PennDOT to L&S; on January 31, 2003.stb.dot.gov Service was suspended in 2005 when a bridge spanning the Wallenpaupack Creek was destroyed after Pennsylvania Power & Light made emergency water releases from the Lake Wallenpaupack Dam following heavy rains in April 2005: heavy rainfalls in June 2006 further damaged the weakened structure. L&S; acquired control of the Stourbridge from Robey in July 2006.gpo.gov A grant of $800,000 from the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development, plus $703,278 worth of FEMA money were put towards repairing the trestle over Wallenpaupack Creek. In May 2008, the line was purchased by Paul Brancato, a principal in Ideal Steel Supply Corp. who planned to build a steel fabrication plant at White Mills. Operation were initially contracted to Central Penn Railroad. The line between Norfolk Southern Railroad and Route 590 in Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania was repaired in anticipation of resumed service. It was suddenly announced in September 2008 that operation would transfer from Central Penn Railroad to the Morristown & Erie Railway (M&E;); operations began in January 2009 as the Stourbridge Railway. Passenger excursions to Hawley and Lackawaxen were operated on behalf of Wayne County. Suspension Citing a lack of funds, M&E; absconded all funds and fled back to New Jersey. In December 2011, that service had ceased indefinitely. A news story dated September 11, 2012 provided additional details, stating \\"a lack of money is keeping the Stourbridge Line Railroad excursions in Wayne County idle for the first time in more than 30 years... [T]he train needs repairs, and so do the tracks. One reason those repairs are not being made is because the land the tracks run through is up for sale... With the tracks used by the Stourbridge line being up for sale, and all the repairs that need to be made, no one is sure when, or even if, this train will be back up and running.\\"wnep.com Reopening The Stourbridge Line resumed operations on May 9, 2015.

It was recorded in 1976 as a means of selling his songwriting services to other musicians, but was released as a commercial prospect. Attic Demonstration Attic Demonstration featured Higney on vocals and electric and acoustic guitars, with an ad hoc band consisting of Higney‚Äôs personal friends Gordon Gaines (guitars, drums), John Duva (bass guitar), and Mark Volpe (guitar, percussion). It had a limited release of 500 copies in September 1976, and earned a favourable review in Trouser Press magazine, but was not a commercial success. Nonetheless it became a cult item amongst record collectors over subsequent years. It was re-mastered and re-released on CD by Higney‚Äôs own label, Kebrutney Records, in 2003 and on vinyl by One Kind Favor in 2012. The remaster also included Higney‚Äôs 1980 7-inch single ‚ÄúI Wanna Be The King‚Äù, b/w ‚ÄúFunky Kinky‚Äù. The former song was a tribute to New York Dolls guitarist and punk legend Johnny Thunders, and contained the line ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna be a star / I hate the sissy music of John Denver‚Äù, whilst the latter was a foray into the world of disco. Both songs were written by Higney, and featured Gordon Gaines and Mark Volpe, plus John Lynch (bass guitar).

As this album was recorded with the intention of being released as an actual recording (as opposed to Attic Demonstration which was originally conceived as demo versions of songs), Higney enlisted the help of hired guns - Jack Pearson (formerly of The Allman Brothers Band), Elizabeth Pearson, William Howse, Richard Carter and others - to produce a more professional recording. American Dirt was described by one radio DJ as if a record label had heard Attic Demonstration and given Higney money to record a 'proper album'. Ambulance Driver 2011 saw the release of Higney‚Äôs third album - Ambulance Driver - which contained ten new recordings with one song, ‚ÄúNonsense‚Äù, coming from the days of Attic Demonstration and the remaining nine songs being, pretty much, newly written. This release contains Higney‚Äôs most recently written songs, among them ‚ÄúAngels Touched The Ground‚Äù, ‚ÄúJet Party‚Äù and, the newest of them all, ‚ÄúBroken By a Whore‚Äù.

The case would later be portrayed in the 1939 film Young Mr. Lincoln.  Early life  Armstrong was born to Jack and Hannah Armstrong. Jack died in 1857. Abraham Lincoln was a friend of the Armstrongs and regularly visited and would cradle baby William. Murder trial Armstrong was charged with the August 29, 1857, murder of James Preston Metzker in Mason County, Illinois. His father, Jack Armstrong, had been a friend of Lincoln while he was studying law in New Salem, Illinois. When Lincoln heard of the murder charge, he wrote to Jack's widow, Hannah, and volunteered his legal services pro bono. The trial was moved to Cass County and held at the courthouse at Beardstown, Illinois. Witness Charles Allen testified that he saw Duff Armstrong strike Metzker with a slungshot. Under cross-examination, Lincoln pushed for further detail and Charles Allen testified that he was at a distance of 150 feet, but could clearly see the act by the light of the moon. Abraham Lincoln used judicial notice, then a very uncommon tactic, to show Allen lied on the stand when he claimed he had witnessed the crime in the moonlight. Lincoln produced an almanac to show that the moon on that date could not have produced enough light for the witness to see anything clearly. Based on this evidence, the jury acquitted Armstrong after only one ballot., \\"2009 Illinois State Bar Association High School Mock Trial Invitational\\"  Service in the Civil War  Armstrong went on to join the Union forces in the American Civil War.

One of the last of his works was his memoir The Novel of Memoirs (–†–æ–º–∞–Ω-–í–æ—Å–ø–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞–Ω–∏–µ) telling about all the different people (from Stalin and Yeltsin, to Okudzhava and Tendryakov) he met during his long life. Writer Maria Rybakova is his granddaughter. Biography Rybakov was born in the city of Chernigov, Russian Empire (now Chernihiv, Ukraine) in a Jewish family.Interview with Rybakov (in Russian) ‚Äì an article in Druzhba Narodov literary magazine, 1999. In 1934 he was arrested by the NKVD and exiled to Siberia for three years. After the end of his exile, he worked as a transport worker. During World War II, he was a tank commander. In 1948, he wrote the popular children's book Dirk (–ö–æ—Ä—Ç–∏–∫). In 1950, he published the novel Drivers (–í–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª–∏), then in 1979, the novel Heavy Sand (–¢—è–∂—ë–ª—ã–π –ü–µ—Å–æ–∫) about the fate of a Jewish family under Nazi occupation. Heavy Sand is an epic story of four generations of a Jewish family living in Communist Russia and its life in a ghetto during the Nazi occupation, culminating in their participation in a ghetto uprising. Though the story of the ghetto uprising is fictional, some details of it seem to be based on the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto. It is believed that the novel is based on numerous stories collected by Rybakov from people who survived Nazi occupation of Ukraine. This story was dubbed the \\"first Russian Holocaust novel\\" by one of the Western newspapers of the time. The book became a television series in 2008. His most popular novel, Children of the Arbat, was written and distributed via samizdat in the 1960s, but was not published until 1987 despite having been officially announced for publication in 1966 and 1978 (in both cases publication was canceled at the very last moment by the Soviet government).

Rybakov was a laureate of the USSR and RSFSR state awards. He was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1948 and 1951. He received an honorary doctorate from Tel Aviv University. Almost all his books have been made into movies. Rybakov‚Äôs books have been published in 52 countries, with overall distribution exceeding 20 million copies. Marina Goldovskaya, a Russian-born documentary filmmaker, forged a deep friendship with Rybakov after meeting him at the French Consulate in Moscow.

Conventionally, a renegade show takes place in the earlier evenings of a juggling convention as a means for the jugglers to collaborate and share material that is unpolished or risqu√©. Acts in a renegade show, perhaps as a reaction to the commonly \\"g-rated\\" content of most juggling performances, frequently include drinking, heckling, and nudity, and are usually not open to the public (as opposed to the \\"gala show\\" at a juggling convention, an invitational and ticketed performance open to the public).  Format  A renegade show usually occurs late in the evening can continue for several hours (depending on the number of acts). Drinking is often a component of a renegade show; at some conventions, each act is offered a drink in exchange for performing. Sometimes the emcee takes a drink for each one consumed by the performers. And since many acts at a renegade show are of low quality, sometimes the audience is encouraged to allow or deny a drink to a performer (determined by applause or heckling). Creative heckling is usually encouraged at a renegade show, sometimes resulting in performers getting booed off the stage. At larger conventions, the audience can come and go as they like, with a show concluding when the audience shrinks to a small enough size. Often a renegade show concludes when the alcohol supply runs out. Designed to showcase the polished material of new performers and the unpolished material of experienced performers, a renegade show is an ideal venue to try out new work, new ideas, bad ideas, unfinished or half-thought-through ideas, just to improvise or to do 'satire' or make parodies of performances seen on the main stages at the convention. People come and sign-up to perform on an ad-hoc basis (or even just jump onto the stage when there's no one ready to perform). Sometimes the music is provided (randomly) by the sound technician; sometimes the performer has some music to work with; and sometimes performers perform acts that don't incorporate any kind of juggling at all (such as comedy, music, dance, burlesque, etc.).  History  The origins of the renegade show: a small group of jugglers at the International Jugglers' Association convention in the United States decided that they wanted a late night cabaret. This was not possible at the official IJA event, so they found a local bar/venue and put on a show. The idea was motivated and created by the Renegade Juggling Company (based in Santa Cruz, California) hence the name 'Renegade Show'. In the 1980s, the Renegade Juggling Company came to the European Juggling Convention and put on a Renegade Show at the convention. It was a great success and since that year the Renegade Show has been an event at the EJC. To begin with it really was just a few jugglers (10 or 20) having a laugh, over the years the Renegade Show has become, more or less, an essential element of the EJC and also of many national and local juggling conventions. It's still a place to improvise and be creative.

It was introduced in November 1998 and was offered as recently as 2007, though is no longer. The camera is the successor to the EOS-5 but has a lot in common with the canon EOS-1n such as the operation of the camera controls and the environmental sealing, whereas the EOS-5 has none. The common heritage of the EOS-3 and EOS-1 line is also seen in the accessories (such as the motor-drive and battery pack) which are mostly the same or at least interchangeable. The EOS-3 introduced the 45-point autofocus system later used in the EOS-1v, EOS-1D and subsequent Canon professional SLRs. It was the last camera outside the 1-series, either film or digital, to receive Canon's top-of-the-line AF system until the March 2012 announcement of the EOS 5D Mark III. The EOS-3 inherited a refined version of the Eye-Control system of the EOS-5. This system, when calibrated to a given user, allowed for picking one of the 45 points of the autofocus system simply by looking at it though the viewfinder. An infrared transmitter and receiver mounted around the eyepiece monitored the position of the iris, thus \\"knowing\\" where the photographer was looking and focusing on that point. The system has its limitations however, notably eyeglasses and occasionally contact lenses would confuse the system. This feature was never rolled forward to the later 1V body. The shutter unit of the EOS-3 passed Canon's standard endurance tests of 100,000 shutter cycles whereas the EOS-1v was specified to withstand at least 150,000 shutter cycles.

He was the leader of the Samoa Party. As the Controller and Chief Auditor, Su'a Rimoni's efforts against government corruption in Samoa earned him international notability. From 1992 to 1995 he refused to authorise illegal payments to Cabinet Ministers as Controller and Chief Auditor. In 1994 he tabled an Annual Report to Parliament that revealed wide-scale corruption in the Human Rights Protection Party (HRPP) government under Tofilau Eti Alesana. The report implicated six out of 13 ministers in improper activities and payments. The government's response was to set up a Commission of Inquiry to discredit the Report. The Commission looked not into the irregularities, but into the Chief Auditor himself. Included among the committee's members were several individuals criticised in his report. In July 1995 the government suspended Sua. He then sued the Attorney General and the Legislative Assembly, stating that they had acted unlawfully by referring his report to the Commission of Inquiry instead of the Public Accounts Committee, and in particular that the former had violated Article 99 of the Constitution. As such in 1997 the HRPP amended the Constitution to make the Controller and Chief Auditor appointed for a term of three years, and to permit his removal upon motion of the government and a simple majority vote by Parliament. Prior to this amendment the position of Controller and Chief Auditor was like that of the Chief Justice, an appointment with life tenure until the age of 60 with the threshold for removal being a two-thirds vote of parliament. The whole scandal brought Samoa into international scrutiny and questioned its commitment to good governance, as well as democracy and responsible government.

Johnson, born Mary Virginia Eshelman (February 11, 1925 ‚Äì July 24, 2013), was an American sexologist, best known as a member of the Masters and Johnson sexuality research team. Along with her partner, William H. Masters, she pioneered research into the nature of human sexual response and the diagnosis and treatment of sexual dysfunctions and disorders from 1957 until the 1990s. Early life Virginia Johnson was born in Springfield, Missouri, the daughter of Edna (n√©e Evans) and Hershel \\"Harry\\" Eshelman, a farmer. Her paternal grandparents were members of the LDS Church, and her father had Hessian ancestry. When she was five, her family moved to Palo Alto, California, where her father worked as a groundskeeper for a hospital. The family later returned to Missouri and farming. Virginia enrolled at her hometown's Drury College at age 16, but dropped out and spent four years working in the Missouri state insurance office. She eventually returned to school, studying at the University of Missouri and the Kansas City Conservatory of Music, and during World War II began a music career as a band singer. She sang country music for radio station KWTO in Springfield, where she adopted the stage name Virginia Gibson. Johnson moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where she became a business writer for the St. Louis Daily Record. Eschewing a singing career, Johnson enrolled at Washington University in St. Louis, intending to earn a degree in sociology but never attaining one. Sexological works Johnson met William H. Masters in 1957 when he hired her as a research assistant at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Washington University in St. Louis. Masters trained her in medical terminology, therapy, and research during the years she worked as his assistant. Together they developed polygraph-like instruments that were designed to measure sexual arousal in humans. Using these tools, Masters and Johnson observed and measured about 700 men and women who agreed to engage in sexual activity with other participants or masturbate in Masters' laboratory. By observing these subjects, Johnson helped Masters identify the four stages of sexual response. This came to be known as the human sexual response cycle. The cycle consists of the excitement phase, plateau phase, orgasmic phase, and resolution phase. In 1964, Masters and Johnson established their own independent nonprofit research institution in St. Louis called the Reproductive Biology Research Foundation. The center was renamed the Masters and Johnson Institute in 1978. In April 2009, Thomas Maier reported in Scientific American that Johnson had serious reservations about the Masters and Johnson Institute's program to convert homosexuals into heterosexuals,Maier, Thomas (April 22, 2009). \\"Can Psychiatrists Really 'Cure' Homosexuality? Masters and Johnson Claimed to Convert Gays to Heterosexuality in a 1979 Book. But Did They?\\". Scientific American. Retrieved August 10, 2013. a program which ran from 1968 to 1977. Personal life By her early 20s, Johnson had married a Missouri politician; the marriage lasted two days. She then married a much older attorney, whom she also divorced. In 1950, Johnson married bandleader George Johnson, with whom she had a boy and a girl, before divorcing in 1956. In 1971, Johnson married William Masters after he divorced his first wife. They were divorced in 1993, though they continued to collaborate professionally. Johnson died in July 2013 \\"of complications from several illnesses\\".. Seattle Post-Intelligencer. Masters, who married again after his divorce from Johnson, died in 2001.

Vickers is particularly notable for her work in the field of gender in politics. Personal Vickers was born in Britain during the Second World War in 1942, to an English mother and a father who was a Canadian serviceman posted in England. After the war she and her war-bride mother followed her father to Canada, where they resided in Hamilton, Ontario, until her parents' divorce. Thereafter, she and he mother moved to Toronto, where she graduated from Harbord Collegiate. She briefly attended Queen's University, transferring to Carleton University, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1965. She moved to London, England, where she studied at the London School of Economics, eventually earning a Doctor of Philosophy in political philosophy. She has been a professor at Carleton since 1971. She was married to the Carleton history professor Keith Johnson until his death in 2018. Politics A self-described socialist and long-time activist and supporter of the New Democratic Party, Vickers ran for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada, during the 1979 federal election as the candidate for the NDP for the riding of Ottawa‚ÄîCarleton. Although she finished third, behind the Progressive Conservative incumbent Jean Pigott and the victorious Liberal candidate Jean-Luc P√©pin, the experience was an important development in her understanding of the challenges faced by women involved in partisan politics in Canada. In 1984, in an event , she (with Gerald Caplan) debated Objectivist philosophers John Ridpath and Leonard Peikoff, defending socialism against their advocacy of laissez-faire capitalism.

The name, which emerged in the wake of progressive trance in 1996, is derived from the feeling which listeners claim to get (often described as a \\"rush\\"). The genre, which originated in Germany, is massively popular in the trance scene, and is one of the dominant forms of dance music worldwide. Historically it is related to the emergence of psychedelic trance and the two styles influenced each other. Classical music strongly influenced the development of uplifting trance both in the 1990sFassbender, Torsten (2008). The Trance Experience. Knoxville, Tennessee: Sound Org Inc. : p. 15 and in the 2000s, with film music also considered influential.Webber, Stephen (2008). DJ Skills: The Essential Guide to Mixing and Scratching. Oxford, UK: Elsevier Press. Characteristics In general, uplifting trance is a style much lighter in tone than other trance genres (such as Goa). Instead of the darker tone of Goa, uplifting trance uses similar chord progressions as progressive trance, but tracks' chord progressions usually rest on a major chord, and the balance between major and minor chords in a progression will determine how \\"happy\\" or \\"sad\\" the progression sounds. The genre features longer major chord progressions in all elements (lead synth, bass, and treble). It also contains extended breakdowns and relegation of arpeggiation (the melodic part of the song, usually consisting of \\"Saw Synths/Square Lead\\" type sounds) to the background while bringing wash effects to the fore (the harmonic element of the music, or \\"background fill\\", usually consisting of synth choir/voice/string chord progressions). There is a close relation between uplifting trance and uplifting house. As a rule of thumb, trance beats in the range of 128‚Äì140 BPM. Uplifting trance very commonly employs side-chain compression, a modern production technique. It is commonly referred to as \\"ducking the kick\\", where the background strings/synths have their volume automated, creating a pulsing effect on the off-beat. Etymology The term has been used to describe what most other people call \\"epic trance\\" in the UK's trance scene, to describe some non UK-based commercial trance acts, like Brooklyn Bounce or Darude, which has created some confusion in terminology and classification. Many UK fans call those acts \\"uplifting house\\". The term is also used on the psychedelic trance/Goa trance scene, although these styles are not really meant to sound uplifting (there is the possibility some people may be thinking of the term \\"uplifting\\" in this case to mean \\"euphoric\\"). Current status Beginning in the latter part of the 2000s, uplifting trance saw an eruption in interest amongst new and old fans and re-established itself within the trance scene, played by such leading trance artists as 4 Strings, ATB, Ferry Corsten, Armin van Buuren, Dash Berlin, RAM, Jorn van Deynhoven, Ti√´sto and Above & Beyond. (A decade earlier Paul Oakenfold, Sasha & Digweed, and Paul van Dyk had sparked interest.) Today, uplifting has emerged as a widely popular electronic dance music subgenre with DJs and producers such as John O'Callaghan, Daniel Kandi, Bryan Kearney, Andy Blueman, Aly & Fila, Sean Tyas and Super8 & Tab focusing particularly on uplifting trance as their overriding genre, and others, such as Jason van Wyk, Above & Beyond, who include uplifting trance as part of their broader repertoire. In addition, online radio stations such as Paris One and Afterhours.FM are significantly devoted to uplifting trance. In September 2009, Afterhours.FM hosted \\"Uplift Day\\" that was exclusively dedicated to uplifting trance. In recent years, a subgenre of uplifting trance‚Äîdubbed \\"orchestral uplifting\\" or \\"uplifting trance with symphonic orchestra\\" and pioneered by Andy Blueman, Ciro Visone, SoundLift, Arctic Moon, Ralph Barendse, Simon O'Shine, Ahmed Romel and others‚Äîhas developed, wherein the timbres and instruments used in the track are those used in symphonic orchestras, including flutes, non-lyrical choral voices, violins, pianos, horns, orchestral drums, and others, and often includes even-longer-than-usual emotional orchestral breakdowns, while still preserving the other aspects of uplifting trance, therefore differing from the subgenre that was called \\"orchestral trance\\" a decade earlier. This new style has noticeably influenced the work of many artists outside the uplifting scene, including the Black Pearl project of Ralph Fritsch and Roger Shah, who ordinarily identifies with Balearic trance rather than uplifting.

Unlike the British adult humour comic Viz and the Nordic adult humour magazine Pyton/Myrkky, Pahkasika did not include much pornography despite sometimes very ribald jokes. Instead it focused more on such things as alcoholism, family crises, xenophobia and other negative aspects of adult life, all presented in a humorous way that appeared deceptively child-friendly. Some of the jokes in the magazine were almost indistinguishable from articles in a mainstream magazine. Recurring strips in Pahkasika included: * Miihkali, a kindergarten-aged boy whose parents are nearly always having a crisis, either with him or with each other, but usually Miihkali doesn't understand what is going on at all. * Pahkeinen, an old man with a nihilistic attitude to life, and his alcoholic dog who sometimes acts as a guide dog. * Per√§smies, a parody of Superman (called Ter√§smies in Finland), a superhero who could fly by farting loudly due to eating canned pea soup contaminated by an explosion at a nuclear plant. * Vanhat herrat, two men engaging on adventures, accompanied with relatives and friends all dressed up in black suits or in similar fashion as the two men. * Hemmo Paskiainen, a wildchild in his early teens who hangs out with his friends Stegu and L√∂ka drinking beer, smoking cigarettes and terrorizing other people, especially his father Armas and characters like priests and fine ladies. * Armas Paskiainen, father of Hemmo Paskiainen. These strips take place in the same universe with Hemmo Paskiainen, but perspective is the father's. Common themes include unsuccessful attempts of fatherhood, cheating Hemmo's mother, eating pills, drinking alcohol, committing suicide and dying. * Hyv√§ sin√§, short and absurd strips drawn with a distinctive style by Teemu Suviala with a signature \\"Mies Suviala\\". * Kolme Rumaa Teroa, (\\"Three Ugly Teros\\") three-frame strips of three guys causing pain and harm to people in various ways. Their usual victims are best categorized as being \\"politically correct\\" people. The magazine also featured irregular articles such as photomanipulations and a course in foreign languages, with all the example phrases having a subtly different (and more humorous) meaning. The magazine also featured regularly lists of one-liner puns. Parodies of different mail- order catalogues were also popular. The mail order catalogues usually had a common theme for all the stuff that was offered. For example, computer games for the elderly -catalog had a molotov cocktail joystick for Winter War veterans. Recurring theme was also imaginary magazines, couple of pages laid out in a way to resemble some other magazine than Pahkasika. These usually made fun of a particular theme. Examples of the sub-magazines include \\"Kakka\\" (\\"poop\\" in Finnish), parodying zombies as a popular culture theme and \\"Luksus\\" (\\"luxury\\" in Finnish), making fun about fashionable high society lifestyle magazines. The latter featured a most likely fictitious short interview with the rock singer Juice Leskinen.

RNase L is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the RNASEL gene. This gene encodes a component of the interferon-regulated 2'-5'oligoadenylate (2'-5'A) system that functions in the antiviral and antiproliferative roles of interferons. RNase L is activated by dimerization, which occurs upon 2'-5'A binding, and results in cleavage of all RNA in the cell. This can lead to activation of MDA5, an RNA helicase involved in the production of interferons.  Synthesis and activation  RNase L activation pathway-IFN factors bind the receptor and lead transcription and modifications of OAS. Viral dsRNA binds OAS, so that 2'-5'A is produced leading to the dimerization of RNase L. Activated RNase L cleaves all RNA in the cell, which can activate MDA5 leading to interferon production. RNase L is present in very minute quantities during the normal cell cycle. When interferon binds to cell receptors, it activates transcription of around 300 genes to bring about the antiviral state. Among the enzymes produced is RNase L, which is initially in an inactive form. A set of transcribed genes codes for 2‚Äô-5‚Äô Oligoadenylate Synthetase (OAS). The transcribed RNA is then spliced and modified in the nucleus before reaching the cytoplasm and being translated into an inactive form of OAS. The location of OAS in the cell and the length of the 2‚Äô-5‚Äô oligoadenylate depends on the post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications of OAS. OAS is only activated under a viral infection, when a tight binding of the inactive form of the protein with a viral dsRNA, consisting of the retrovirus‚Äô ssRNA and its complementary strand, takes place. Once active, OAS converts ATP to pyrophosphate and 2‚Äô-5‚Äô-linked oligoadenylates (2-5A), which are 5‚Äô end phosphorylated. 2-5 A molecules then bind to RNase L, promoting its activation by dimerization. In its activated form RNase L cleaves all RNA molecules in the cell leading to autophagy and apoptosis. Some of the resulting RNA fragments can also further induce the production of IFN-Œ≤ as noted in the Significance section. This dimerization and activation of RNase L can be recognized using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), as oligoribonucleotides containing a quencher and a fluorophore on opposite sites are added to a solution with inactive RNase L. The FRET signal is then recorded as the quencher and the fluorophore are very close to each other. Upon the addition of 2-5A molecules, RNase L becomes active, cleaving the oligoribonucleotides and interfering in the FRET signal.  Significance  RNase L is part of the body's innate immune defense, namely the antiviral state of the cell. When a cell is in the antiviral state, it is highly resistant to viral attacks and is also ready to undergo apoptosis upon successful viral infection. Degradation of all RNA within the cell (which usually occurs with cessation of translation activity caused by protein kinase R) is the cell's last stand against a virus before it attempts apoptosis. Interferon beta (IFN-Œ≤), a type I interferon responsible for antiviral activity, is induced by RNAse L and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) in the infected cell. The relationship between RNAse L and MDA5 in the production of IFNs has been confirmed with siRNA tests silencing the expression of either molecule and noting a marked decline in IFN production. MDA5, an RNA helicase, is known to be activated by complex high molecular weight dsRNA transcribed from the viral genome. In a cell with RNAse L, MDA5 activity may be further enhanced. When active, RNAse L cleaves and identifies viral RNA and feeds it into MDA5 activation sites, enhancing the production of IFN-Œ≤. The RNA fragments produced by RNAse L have double stranded regions, as well as specific markers, that allow them to be identified by the RNAse L and MDA5. Some studies have suggested that high levels of RNAse L may actually inhibit IFN-Œ≤ production, but a clear linkage still exists between RNAse L activity and IFN-Œ≤ production. Furthermore, it has been shown that RNase L is involved in many diseases. In 2002, the ‚Äúhereditary prostate cancer 1‚Äù locus (HPC1) was mapped to the RNASEL gene, indicating that mutations in this gene cause a predisposition to prostate cancer. Impairments of the OAS/RNase L pathway in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) have been investigated.

The station served primarily as an academic broadcasting lab housed in the Academic Complex transmitting from the residence hall Pearce-Ford Tower with 100 watts of power. New Rock 92's signal covered a five mile radius. This would change in 2001 when broadcasting instructor Marjorie Yambor became general manager of the station. Dr. Yambor would transform the simple broadcast lab into a full-fledged competitive station. This began by rebranding the station as Revolution 91.7, along with newly constructed studio spaces, a new tower and a boost in effective radiated power to 1,300 watts, expanding the station's broadcast radius to about thirty miles. Following the transmitter upgrade in 2002, WWHR began a 24-hour programming schedule (with the exception of winter breaks and technical issues) In 2015, Marjorie Yambor left the position of General Manager. While the University searched for a replacement, broadcasting instructors Victoria LaPoe and Jeanine Cherry fulfilled interim management duties alongside student managers Angela Conway and Taylor Hodgkins overseeing day-to-day operations. In 2016, former Nashville Public Radio employee Emil Moffat was named General Manager fulfilling the management duties for both WWHR and WKYU-FM. WWHR switched to a Triple A format in late 2017, coinciding with new on-air branding and an updated logo. Annual events Each year, Revolution 91.7 brings two charity music festivals to Bowling Green. During the fall semester, Revolution 91.7 presents RevFest - an on-campus music festival and competition featuring various musical acts in the community. The station also hosts another festival in the spring known as Mayhem. Unlike RevFest, it is held off-campus and usually features bigger names in the local and regional area as well as a national scale headliner. Many area businesses and organizations also attend featuring booths in support of the event or offering of goods and services. Programming The programming at Revolution 91.7 is well known for its diversity. Music selections are made by the student operators and directors considering current popular college radio selections as well as local bands and student preferences. In addition to providing music throughout the day, Revolution 91.7 also offers exceptional News and Sports programming along with Student-conceived genre specific specialty shows every evening from 10 pm to Midnight Central Time.

Colour Television in Australia Australia was a little late in introducing colour television, to choose the correct television system, waiting about 5 years from the time PAL was invented. It was then forbidden for broadcasters to transmit the chroma burst signal, until the designated day, 1 March 1975. The broadcasters were allowed to experiment with transmitting colour signals in the picture area, and get their transmission up and running while people who had already bought colour TV sets could only watch the shows in black and white monochrome. There were some people who built a circuit to circumvent this, where they would synchronise the chrominance decoding oscillator manually.

The series aired from 1994 to 1996 in syndication as part of The Marvel Action Hour, which packaged Iron Man with another animated series based on Marvel properties, the Fantastic Four, with one half-hour episode from each series airing back-to- back. The show was backed by a toy line that featured many armor variants. This series of Iron Man was among the few television series to be re-recorded in THX. This may have been usual at the time for a motion picture, but it is rare for a television series. Off the heels of the release of the live-action Iron Man film in 2008, reruns began airing on the Jetix block on Toon Disney. Series overview Although only lasting two seasons, Iron Man was the subject of a major overhaul between seasons when its production studio was changed. The result was a massively changed premise, tone, and general approach, which left the disparate seasons scarcely recognizable as being two halves of the same series. =First season= The first season of Iron Man featured little more than a Masters of the Universe-style battle of \\"good against evil\\", as billionaire industrialist Tony Stark battled the evil forces of the world-conquering Mandarin as the armored superhero, Iron Man. In his evil endeavors to steal Stark's technology and Iron Man's armor, the Mandarin led a group of villains consisting of Dreadknight, Blizzard, Blacklash, Grey Gargoyle (when it comes to fighting Iron Man and his team, he has a tendency to accidentally turn his fellow villains to stone), Hypnotia (an exclusive villain who Dreadknight and Blacklash were rivals for the affections of), Whirlwind, Living Laser, MODOK, Fin Fang Foom, and Justin Hammer. To combat these villains, Iron Man had the help of his own team (based on Force Works, a then-current comic book team which has since faded into obscurity), including Century, War Machine, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye (replacing U.S. Agent from the comics) and Spider Woman. The season consisted mostly of single-episode open- and-shut-case adventures, with two two-part stories late towards the end. Unlike many other Marvel animated series, despite featuring over-the-top titles that paid homage to the early Stan Lee written Marvel comics of the 1960s (for example, \\"The Grim Reaper Wears a Teflon Coat\\", and \\"Rejoice, I am Ultimo, Thy Deliverer\\"), almost none of the episodes were adaptations of comic book stories, consisting instead of original stories penned by Ron Friedman, occasionally collaborated on by Stan Lee himself. The closest the season came to adapting a comic book tale was in the two-part \\"The Origin of Iron Man\\", which recounted a (modified and modernized) version of the character's comic book origin (see below) just before the season concluded. This late-run recounting of the title character's origin is symptomatic of what is generally thought of as the season's greatest weakness ‚Äì despite (or perhaps because of) having such a large cast of characters, very few of the show's heroes and villains were actually developed in any way, leaving viewers unaware of their personal stories and powers.Marvel Animation Age The show is generally held to have been at its best when filling in these origin blanks (MODOK in \\"Enemy Without, Enemy Within,\\"Marvel Animation Age Presents: Iron Man Iron Man and the Mandarin in their self-titled \\"The Origin of...\\" episodesMarvel Animation Age Presents: Iron Man), but these were rare occasions, with virtually every other plot simply consisting of the Mandarin attempting to steal Stark's newest invention and being bested, often through very strange and illogical means (with the nadir perhaps being Iron Man somehow using the energy of a small tape-player to restore his armor to full power in \\"Silence My Companion, Death My Destination\\").Marvel Animation Age Presents: Iron Man A small sub- plot in the first season revolves around Mandarin secretly spying on Force Works. It culminates in \\"The Wedding of Iron Man\\" when Stark realizes they have been spied on by reviewing events from previous episodes (and explaining how Mandarin's forces always knew where they would be), realising that Mandarin has acquired enough information to potentially deduce the true identity of Iron Man. The entire episode's plot is dedicated to resolving the problem, culminating in Iron Man and his team setting up an elaborate deception where Mandarin sees Iron Man and Tony Stark in the same place with the intention being to convince him that the two men are not the same person (The 'Tony' in the situation was an android). =Second season= In 1995, Marvel switched The Marvel Action Hour to a new animation studio (as previously mentioned, the animation in season 1 was provided by the Rainbow Animation Group, while the animation in season 2 was provided by Koko Enterprises), and with it came new writers (Ron Friedman was replaced by Tom TataranowiczTom Tataranowicz Talks Iron Man for season 2) and new music for each sequence, coupled with a new direction for the series. The first season's subtle keyboard theme music for Iron Man (composed by progressive rock artist Keith Emerson) was replaced in the second season by an intense electric guitar theme (composed by William Kevin Anderson), featuring the repeated refrain of \\"I am Iron Man!\\", while showing Tony Stark beating red-hot iron plates into shape with a blacksmith's hammer (possibly to mimic the Black Sabbath song \\"Iron Man\\").\\"The greatest thing to come from the first-ever Iron Man-centric TV series is the incredibly awesome second (and final) season opening credits. Those credits feature a shirtless, mulleted Tony Stark using a large hammer to create his armor, while cheesy faux-metal plays, complete with a familiar refrain ‚Äì \\"I am Iron Man!\\" ‚Äì That's both awful and wonderful all at once.\\" Tony Stark's longer hair style in the second season was based upon the artist Mark Bright's depiction of Stark from the late 1980s, which is where most of the episodes from season 2 were based upon. In the first season, the series seemed to follow the look of an early 1990s Marvel comic (specifically, artist Paul Ryan's take on Iron Man). The new story lines spanned multiple episodes and were no longer \\"open and shut\\" cases. They formed a linking narrative, featuring themes of duplicity, consequence, and phobias. Also, the stories were no longer centered on the Mandarin, whose rings had been scattered and whose power had been depleted. While the Mandarin did appear in these episodes, his appearances were reduced to cameos in the cliffhangers at the end of the story, as he tried to retrieve each ring. Another change was that Force Works was mostly written out of the series, parting ways with Stark after he deceives them in order to work in secret with the Mandarin when Fin Fang Foom and his fellow Dragons were plotting to eliminate Earth. When Stark's counter plan against Justin Hammer, which includes faking his death without the knowledge of his teammates, leads to a disbanding of Force Works, Julia Carpenter and James Rhodes are the only ones who continue to work with Stark. This split would be revisited with Stark's ensuing conflicts with Hawkeye over the course of several episodes. Also, War Machine develops a phobia of being trapped inside his armor (also based on a then-current comic storyline), but this is resolved before the final episode. While Rhodes was active as War Machine in season 1, he remained out of armor for the majority of season 2 due to reliving a tragic drowning experience while being trapped underwater in the War Machine armor in the season 2 episode \\"Fire and Rain\\". Rhodes eventually overcomes his fear and dons the War Machine armor once again in the episode \\"Distant Boundaries\\". Prior to finding his last two rings, the Mandarin claims his eighth ring from MODOK in the episode \\"Empowered\\". \\"Empowered\\" was the clip show of the season, the purpose being that the Mandarin wanted to learn of Iron Man's recent activities. In the finale,The Hands Of The Mandarin, Part OneThe Hands of the Mandarin, Part Two the Mandarin, having regained all of his rings, unleashes a mist using the Heart of Darkness to render everything technological useless. Iron Man reunites with Force Works in order to stop him. The Mandarin unmasks Iron Man before their final showdown ends in his death. More specifically, Iron Man manages to reflect the power of Mandarin's rings, destroying them, and ultimately leaving the Mandarin with amnesia and helpless before a band of desert bandits who likely killed him, or at least cut off his hand/fingers for the rings. After Mandarin was killed, MODOK and the rest of Mandarin's henchmen were sent to jail. After disappointing ratings, the series was canceled. =The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series) and Spider-Man (1994 TV series) crossovers= Dorian Harewood reprises his role of War Machine from the solo Iron Man animated series in the episode \\"Helping Hand, Iron Fist\\". He originally stops Rick Jones from seeing Tony Stark (voiced by Robert Hays, who was also reprising his Iron Man role) at Stark Enterprises, but takes him to Stark after Jones explained that he needed Stark's help to find Bruce Banner. He later alerts Stark of the arrival of General Ross, S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Gabriel Jones, and a squad of Hulkbusters. War Machine fights some of the Hulkbusters alongside Jones and Iron Man. A different version of Iron Man was once again voiced by Robert Hays and a different version of War Machine was voiced by James Avery (reprising their parts from the Iron Man animated series around the same period at the time when Dorian Harewood was voicing Tombstone) on Spider-Man: The Animated Series. They first appeared in the episodes \\"Venom Returns\\" and \\"Carnage\\" in which Dormammu orders Venom to steal the Time Dilation Accelerator from Stark Enterprises, which is capable of releasing Dormammu from his own far-off dimension. Venom is quickly defeated by Spider-Man and War Machine. However, Venom gets help from Cletus Kasady, his cellmate who has bonded with another symbiote, Carnage. After the Symbiotes steal the machine, War Machine is too wounded to continue fighting, so Iron Man teams up with Spider-Man and stops the Symbiotes and prevent Dormammu from leaving his dimension. Iron Man also makes a cameo in the episode called \\"The Spot, in which Tony Stark fires Dr. Jonathon Ohn from the Time Dilation Accelerator project because Stark knows the project is dangerous after Carnage almost released Dormammu to Earth using Accelerator machinery. Iron Man later appears in the three-part episode Secret Wars in which the Beyonder creates a war between good and evil to see who is better. In the end, the heroes win and everyone, except for Spider-Man who has to stop the evil Spider-Carnage from destroying all of reality in the following series finale, is sent back to Earth without any memory.

In modernizing the character's origin story, Tony Stark is not injured in a Vietnamese war zone, but in an act of industrial sabotage plotted by Justin Hammer (who also orchestrated the death of Tony's father, which was later revealed to be a cover-up by S.H.I.E.L.D. in \\"Not Far From the Tree\\") and the Mandarin. Wounded not by a chunk of shrapnel near his heart, but by slivers near his spine, Stark and Ho Yinsen (whose first name is changed to Wellington) were held captive by the Mandarin, rather than Wong-Chu. Yinsen works with Arnold Brock before Arnold becomes the Mandarin. The Mandarin later captures Wellington Yinsen to use him to help Tony Stark build an invincible armor for his minions. When Tony Stark becomes Iron Man for the first time, he manages to escape, but Yinsen is killed by the Mandarin. The Mandarin himself was subject to heavy modification, altered by his rings to a much greater extent than in the comics. He gained green skin (a fate which befell other Asian villains in animation around the time, such as Doctor No in James Bond Jr. and Ming the Merciless in Defenders of the Earth) and an enhanced musculature, but the show did retain the connection between his origin and Fin Fang Foom. As previously mentioned, The Mandarin once was known as Arnold Brock, an archaeologist who falls into an ancient catacomb containing an alien starship (which as previously alluded to, belongs to this series' incarnation of Fin Fang Foom, whom Mandarin forged an uneasy alliance with) while fleeing from deserts bandits. In this catacomb, he finds a large gem that is the ship's power source with ten gems beneath it. Unfortunately, the bandits slay everyone else, including his fianc√©e Ilona. All the raiders leave behind are his fianc√©e's rings with the jewels plucked from them. The Mandarin uses these as the settings for the ten gems which he made into his rings. The Mandarin of this continuity was altered by the power of the ship's power source when he touched it; he developed pointy ears, claw-like fingernails, and enhanced musculature. His skin turned emerald-green, and he became very smart. The cartoon's versions of the rings were much more ambiguous, with no particular power associated with any ring ‚Äì most frequently, they were used to project force blasts, alter reality, and transmute objects. The eleventh episode of Season 2, \\"Hulkbuster\\" would reveal the specific abilities of two of the rings: * One allows for creating windows through time and space. * The other allows for traveling through the windows. They were both used by The Leader in an attempt to travel back to the time that the Gamma Bomb that transformed Bruce Banner into the Hulk detonated. As previously mentioned, Fin Fang Foom is shown as an ally of the Mandarin, but in the opening of the second season, it was revealed that this was a ploy to have gained Mandarin's trust, then betrayed him when his Dragon brethren regained their monstrous forms and made a core from their starship which will open up a portal to their world and allow their kind to invade earth. He is supposedly killed in the explosion that scatters Mandarin's rings across the world. Aside from these origin stories, the only episode to draw on a comic book in any way was \\"Rejoice! I Am Ultimo, Thy Deliverer,\\" which featured the Mandarin's robotic servant Ultimo from the 1960s, but featured his appearance and alien-born origin from the 1990s. The Mandarin's minions (with the exception of the original character, Hypnotia) were all solo operators in the comics, most significantly arms-dealing business man Justin Hammer, who was a criminal mastermind in his own right, rather than a villain who would serve another. A much smaller MODOK appears as a scientist who sought to cure the criminal mind. His boss Red Ghost increased his mind by 100 times. He soon fell in love and married famous ballerina Alana Ulanova (voiced by Sarah Douglas), who later became a swimsuit model. The Red Ghost was envious of his relationship with his new wife and turned him into MODOK. He served as Mandarin's second-in-command so that he could turn him back into a human. However, in the second season MODOK's character became little more than comic relief, with his original back-story forgotten (When asked why he served the Mandarin after all the abuse he took from him, MODOK gushingly replied \\"He makes me laugh\\", which may be a reference to Jessica Rabbit). After Mandarin was defeated in the season finale, MODOK (alongside Mandarin's henchmen) was sent to jail. Force Works, on the other hand, were lifted straight from the comics, but their actual civilian roles (a scene in the episode \\"Data In ‚Äì Chaos Out\\" however, gives Century a civilian identity as a man named Woody, sporting shades and a broad- brimmed hat) were never defined in the cartoon, save for Spider-Woman, who was recast as the vice president of research and development for Stark Enterprises. Notably, the cartoon's Scarlet Witch owes next to nothing to the comic book character: here, she is a mystical, tarot-reading spiritualist identified in the closing credits as \\"Wanda Frank\\" (an alias by her in the comics, in which her real name is \\"Wanda Maximoff\\"), who speaks with a thick Eastern-European (or according to the closed captioning, German) accent and refers to other characters as \\"pumpkin\\" and \\"cupcake\\". Her power is identified as a \\"hex sense,\\" but what that means is never explained, and seems to allow her to do anything, from shape-shifting to matter manipulation. In a sub-plot crafted solely for the cartoon, Spider-Woman and the Scarlet Witch vie for the affections of Iron Man. In the first season, Stark does not appear to reciprocate the feelings of either woman, but in the second season it becomes apparent that he harbors some feelings for Julia, only to have his \\"lone wolf\\" attitude complicate their chances of a relationship. Also, Julia Carpenter eventually married Tony Stark. However, this turns out to simply be a ploy by Tony to draw out the Mandarin and convince him he is not Iron Man. While Tony was at the wedding, someone else took up the Iron Man suit and attacked Mandarin. This convinced Mandarin that Tony Stark was not Iron Man. Meanwhile, Rachel Carpenter (Spider-Woman's daughter) also appears in the series, though she is older than her comic book incarnation and with a more \\"rebellious\\" attitude. In \\"Silence My Companion, Death My Destination\\", she is shown as a lover of dance music ‚Äì and arcades ‚Äì disdaining classical composers (specifically Van Cliburn) but after a piece of Rachmaninov played by Cliburn on a cassette given to Rachel manages to recharge Iron Man's armor (as previously mentioned), she changes her mood and begins to appreciate the classical music. =Season 2= The second season performed a complete turnaround, and began regularly adapting major Iron Man comic book stories including \\"Dragon Seed\\" (as \\"The Beast Within\\"), \\"Armor Wars\\" and \\"The Hands of the Mandarin\\" and introducing more characters derived from the comic books, including H.O.M.E.R., Firebrand (the Gary Gilbert version), Sunturion and more. Sunturion's appearance in human form was based on another character named Abner Doolittle, who is a scientist working for the Roxxon Brand Corporation. Arthyr Dearborn's origin is altered having suffering from a deadly disease that he wiped out with a unique form of microwave energy. The treatment's side effects included the ability to transform into Sunturion, and an uncontrollable emitting of radiation, deadly to all others around him. The Star Well station was created to be his sanctuary. Ultimately, Dearborn/Sunturion sacrifices himself stopping the Star Well station from crashing into New York City. This version of Firebrand is the son of the late ex-Stark Industries employee Simon Gilbert. Firebrand was attacking power sources and demanding a ransom of a million dollars. After a series of arson upon power generators, Iron Man confronted Firebrand and had to use his Inferno Armor to confront him. With the lack of solar energy, Iron Man had a hard time stopping a dam that Firebrand detonated. A fragment of the dam hits Firebrand's jet pack causing him to fall into the flood. With Iron Man low on power, War Machine had to face his fear of water to rescue Iron Man and Firebrand. After diverting the flood, Iron Man and War Machine handed Firebrand over to the police. In \\"The Armor Wars\\" two-parter, Justin Hammer had Ghost steal the Stark Armor designs and sold them to each of the armored criminals. For instance, Beetle made a brief appearance during the \\"Armor Wars\\" two-parter, in which he was attacked by Iron Man and had his armor ‚Äì based on stolen Stark designs ‚Äì deactivated. He is voiced by John Reilly with a Liverpudlian accent that evokes the similarly named band. Stilt-Man's armor was also based on Tony Stark's Iron Man technology when he is seen when he was trying to rob a building from the outside. Iron Man used his drill armor to take out one of the legs and then attached a Negator Pack on him. In \\"The Armor Wars (Part 1)\\", Tony Stark's discovery about Crimson Dynamo (who first appeared in \\"Not Far From the Tree\\", where he worked with an A.I.M.-made clone of Howard Stark) using Stark technology as part of his armor ignites the animated version of the Armor Wars. He wore the Crimson Dynamo armor associated with Valentin Shatalov; however, Stark referred him as \\"Yuri\\" in the episode. The Controller also appeared as a guest villain in \\"Armor Wars (Part 1)\\". His slave discs were based on the Iron Man technology which allowed him to mentally control his armor which he used on executives who visited the Center for Achievement and Bliss Spa. Iron Man defeated him and placed a Negator Pack on his armor. The Mandroids appear in \\"Armor Wars (Part 2)\\". When Iron Man invaded the Vault (meanwhile, Blizzard, Grey Gargoyle, and Whirlwind were shown in the cells) to disable the Guardsman armors, he ended up in a fight with them and Hawkeye. Iron Man used the Negator Packs on them. He later attacked the super hero Stingray, only to discover that Stingray's armor didn't use his designs. When War Machine tried to talk him down, Iron Man negated his armor as well and almost killed his fellow hero. Justin Hammer also created Firepower, a deadly armored warrior designed to eliminate his competition. Because it was Hammer Industry Property, Iron Man's Negator Pack doesn't work on it. Iron Man faked his death, but returned in a new armor when it started to attack properties of Stark Industry. After preventing its missile from going off, Iron Man used his suit to hack into the remains of Firepower to learn that Justin Hammer was behind the villains using his Stark Armor designs. After Firepower was defeated, Iron Man appeared in Justin Hammer's office to confront him. Iron Man then placed a virus-containing disc in Justin's computer that completely wiped out any records of his designs and uploaded it to the internet and Hammer's computers. The same virus completely deleted all of Hammer's files, and presumably left his company bankrupt. It is also implied that he is not aware that Stark and Iron Man are one and the same. He was one of the few first season villains who appeared in Season 2 episodes besides the season premiere and the season finale. Madame Masque appeared in the second-season episode \\"Beauty Knows No Pain\\". Like in the comics, Whitney Frost was a former love of Tony's but now obsessed with her own beauty. She became bitter when she lost her beloved looks and Tony. She then became involved with the Maggia and took on the identity of Madame Masque. Upon her discovery of the Golden Sepulcher of Isis which could return her beauty to her, she and her Maggia henchmen kidnapped many workers and Julia Carpenter. Tony Stark arrived at the scene and fought some of the Maggia henchmen until they overwhelmed him upon Madame Masque's arrival. Madame Masque then threatened to kill Julia unless Iron Man retrieved the gem for her. After surviving the deadliest of traps, Iron Man gave Madame Masque the Golden Sepulcher of Isis, and restored her beauty. After becoming Isis due to the artifact's effects, she learned that all she really wanted was Tony. After Madame Masque/Isis' fight with Iron Man, War Machine, and Spider-Woman, the Golden Sepulcher of Isis is destroyed by Iron Man, regressing Isis back to a disfigured Madame Masque. Iron Man then told her the love he once felt for her was inside, and it died years ago. Stark's armor on the show was the Mark XI \\"Modular Armor\\", which was the suit he was wearing in the comics at the time. The first season modified his helmet design to add a traditional mouth slit, but the second season restored the \\"mouthless\\" comic book design. The Season 1 armor appears in flashback in the episode featuring Firebrand. =Iron Man's armor= As noted above, Iron Man's modular armor was his standard suit for his appearance in the animated series, but with a slightly modified face plate to give it the traditional mouth-slit. The suit was redesigned in the second season of the show, most significantly by restoring the \\"mouthless\\" appearance of the armor. The Season 1 armor appeared in flashback early on. One of the most distinctive pieces of animation in the first season was an armor-donning stock footage sequence for Tony Stark, which saw the hero transform his briefcase into his armor and suit up for action. The sequence was not without its own limitations ‚Äì it depicted Stark standing in his lab, wearing a white jacket, but would be used regardless of where Stark was or what he was wearing in the episodes themselves, creating massive visual disconnects. Additionally, in all but one instance (in \\"The Origin of Iron Man\\"), the sequence featured some brief moments of primitive CGI, in which Stark levitated his helmet from the ground and donned it. The trademark of a changing armor remained a constant in the animated series, with the first season featuring the hydro- armor and deep space armor, straight from the comics. The second season, however, was when the variant armors became a focal point of the series; the new modifications Stark made to his suit allowed it to shape-shift into different forms with specialized capabilities that could be called upon for the assorted situations he found himself in. The hydro-armor and space armors were incorporated into this mechanism, and more armors from the comics such as the stealth armor and Hulkbuster armor were introduced. The series also introduced an array of original situational armor designs, including: *Subterranean drill armor ‚Äì Brown and gold, with an arm-mounted pneumatic drill for burrowing. *Inferno armor ‚Äì Red and gold with pink highlights, this armor was resistant to extreme temperatures and outfitting with fire- extinguishing foam, which proved helpful in combat with Firebrand. *Samurai armor ‚Äì Never actually used in combat, this highly stylized armor was blue and grey. *Radiation armor ‚Äì Blue and silver armor to shield against radioactive danger, capable of firing x-ray blasts. *Lava armor ‚Äì Red and silver armor that can resist submergence in magma, which proved helpful when Iron Man had to recover one of the Mandarin's rings from within a volcano. *Magnetic armor ‚Äì Purple and silver, with the ability to generate electromagnetic pulses, once used by a microscopically reduced Iron Man to fibrillate Hawkeye's heart. *Bio-energy armor ‚Äì DNA-powered red and gold armor, used against the Mandarin's anti-technology field in the two-part series finale \\"Hands of the Mandarin\\". *Hydro armor ‚Äì Yellow with a glass-domed helmet, is used for underwater situations. *Space armor ‚Äì Used to break through the Earth's atmosphere, the only thing that appears to be different is that it has a jet pack. *Stealth armor ‚Äì Dark gray, is used to stay silent and is unable to be traced by radar. The toyline also featured two armors which did not appear in the series; an entirely silver arctic armor (used very briefly in the comics) and the Silver Centurion suit, dubbed hologram armor. Home media release On October 8, 2007, both seasons were released together in a Region 2 three- disc set from Jetix Europe and Maximum Entertainment Ltd. in 2007, when Disney had the rights to the Marvel shows and before they brought the rights back, all before the 2009 take over of Marvel by Disney. The 3 disc set had no features and just included all 26 episodes. UK company Clear Vision Ltd. released two sets exclusive to their website on April 19, 2010. One contains all 26 episodes over 4 discs while the other ‚Äì which includes the 1960s Iron Man animated series ‚Äì is a six disc box set entitled Iron Man: The Ultimate Collection. Buena Vista Home Entertainment released the entire series on Region 4 DVD ‚Äì which spans 3 separate volumes ‚Äì on March 30, 2010 and later released the series on Region 1 DVD on May 4, 2010 to coincide with Iron Man 2, which opened in theaters a few days later, on May 7. The series is available on Disney+. Alternate versions: Japan When the show aired on Japanese television stations, the opening sequence was changed, featuring a new J-pop theme song called \\"Eien ga Ai ni Kawaru Toki (Ê∞∏ÈÅ†„ÅåÊÑõ„Å´Â§â„Çè„Çã„Å®„Åç lit. When Eternity Becomes Love)\\" by the J-Pop group Pretty Cast, and splicing in scenes from various episodes alongside the original opening animation, a similar change was made to the ending credits sequence.

History One of Michigan's earliest charter schools, Black River Public School was founded on July 1996 after receiving a charter from Grand Valley State University. Its operations initially took place in the Federal School building on 8th Street and during its four years there, 14 portables were added due to growth. Due to the overcrowding, BASF Corporation donated a building, originally occupied by the Holland Furnace Company, to the school in 1998. In 2001, Black River added a Montessori elementary program. In May 2003, Black River was accredited by the American Academy for Liberal Education (AALE) and in 2004 by the North Central Association Commission of Accreditation and School Improvement.Institution Summary , AdvancED, Retrieved 2012-07-08 In the summer of 2003, Black River added two new 8 and 6 room modular buildings to accommodate more elementary students. In the spring of 2007, Black River completed construction of a new facility housing a gymnasium, lyceum (cafeteria), and music facilities. Previously existing facilities were remodeled to provide additional classroom space. In the fall of 2011 remodeling was completed on a former storage/loading dock facility to house the kindergarten program following its transition to an all-day schedule. In 2014 the school undertook a $4.87 million capital campaign to raise funds for a four part capital project benefiting the entire student body. Improvements included a new 27,000 sf elementary facility (built during the summer of 2015), a building renovation for a new chemistry lab, supplemental gym/cafeteria space, and significant technology upgrades throughout campus. The project was completed successfully with the new buildings opening in the fall of 2015, growing enrollment to nearly 1,000 students in grades K-12. http://www.hollandsentinel.com/article/20141222/NEWS/141229853 Academics In 2014, The Washington Post High School Challenge once again ranked Black River among the top five high schools in the State of Michigan, a distinction it has enjoyed since 2005, including five years ranked #1. Black River offers 18 Advanced Placement (AP) courses, with a participation rate that ranks in the top 1% in North America. 46% of the students who take an AP course achieve a score necessary to receive college credit, compared to the Michigan average of 11%.

It was the second of two Contra games Konami of America co-produced with Appaloosa, following Contra: Legacy of War in 1996. C: The Contra Adventure was never released in Japan, Europe, or Australia. Story A meteorite with an alien infestation heads towards Earth following the events in Contra: Legacy of War. The meteorite falls near a Mayan temple somewhere in South America, and shortly afterward, the temple is occupied by an alien life form staging an invasion, as the natives begin to disappear and the local wildlife is devastated. Tasha, a member of the elite Contra Force, is sent to infiltrate the occupied temple, but goes missing during the operation. Ray Poward (having previously retired after the events of Contra: Legacy of War), is brought back into action to re-establish contact with Tasha and neutralize the alien invaders. Gameplay There are a total of ten levels in the game, which are shown through multiple perspectives, depending on the level: 2-D side- scrolling (referred to as \\"Classic Contra\\" in the game manual), third-person (free-roaming and linear), overhead (360 degree movement), and a special \\"Weightless Elevator\\" view, which alternates between multi-directional and 3D shooting on a single screen. One of the third-person sequences, the \\"Hunting\\" level, plays almost exactly the same as the interior missions in the original Contra. All the innovations that were introduced in Contra: Legacy of War (memory card saving, hitpoints and three-dimensional fire fights) are maintained in this game. However, the gameplay varies depending on the level and perspective used. Three difficulty levels (Easy, Normal and Hard) are available at the outset of the game, though the game ends after the Pyramid 1 stage if playing on Easy. Reception C: The Contra Adventure received several negative reviews during its release. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot gave the game an overall score of 3.6/10.0, stating that \\"It's hard to believe that Konami would release yet another sorry game with the Contra name on it\\". Randy Nelson of IGN gave it a 1.0, saying \\"Definitely not the game Contra fans have been clamoring for\\". Jeremy Parish and Sam Kennedy, in their Contra retrospective for 1up.com, wrote \\"[C: The Contra Adventure] managed to be even worse than Legacy of War, giving [it] the distinction of being the worst game in the series\\". GamePro's review of the game was more positive, stating \\"although flawed, C: The Contra Adventure carries on the franchise with style, picking up bonus points for the variety of its gameplay modes\\".

These highways were once a single major north‚Äìsouth route, connecting Oklahoma City to more rural parts of the state. The original road stretched from SH-7 near Tatums, Oklahoma to SH-11 west of Deer Creek. Due to encroaching Interstate highways‚Äîespecially Interstate 35‚Äîthe middle section of the route through Norman, Moore, and Oklahoma City was decommissioned in 1979 for reasons of redundancy. However, some maps show SH-74 as concurrent with I-35, I-240, and I-44, thus linking the two sections. The north section of the route is in length, while the southern section is long. This leads to a total length of . Route descriptions =Southern section= The southern section's northern terminus, at I-35 in Goldsby. From the southern terminus at SH-7, the southern section of SH-74 goes due north to Elmore City, where it intersects with SH-29. After a couple of turns in the Elmore City area, the highway continues due north to Maysville and SH-19. Still continuing northward, the highway meets the southern terminus of State Highway 24, and continues into Purcell. In Purcell, SH-74 overlaps US-77 and SH-39. It finally splits off and begins heading west. From here, the highway becomes more hilly and curvy as it heads toward Washington. The road never actually enters Washington, passing just one mileDistance signage at the SH-74/SH-24 junction. (1.6 km) north of it. However, Washington is accessible via SH-24, which has its northern terminus at SH-74 as well. (Both termini of SH-24 are at SH-74.) The highway then returns to a due north course after its intersection with SH-24. It goes through the town of Goldsby and then ends at I-35. =Northern section= The end of the Lake Hefner Parkway in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma at its interchange with I-44The highway's northern section begins at a cloverstack interchange with Interstate 44 in Bethany. The first part of the northern section is a freeway, called the Lake Hefner Parkway because part of it runs along the east shore of Lake Hefner. The freeway, a major part of the Oklahoma City freeway system, serves the northwestern part of Oklahoma City. The freeway ends at 164th Street, and Highway 74 continues northward on Portland Avenue. The road passes through the towns of Crescent, Covington, and Garber, Oklahoma as it continues, again on a due north course. Between Covington and Garber the road intersects with US-64/412, which can be used to access Enid, just 14 miles (22.5 km) to the west. Twenty miles (32.2 km) north of US-412, the highway meets US-60 near Lamont. The two roads share a brief concurrency before splitting off again. Eight miles (12.9 km) north of this, SH-74 intersects with SH-11 between Deer Creek and Numa, Oklahoma. It is at this intersection that the designation ends. History Original SH-44 shield In 1927, a spur from SH-33 to Crescent was created as SH-44. SH-44 was renumbered to SH-74 in 1931. On December 10, 1934, SH-74 was extended southward to Oklahoma City. The highway was further extended on September 9, 1935 to Norman. In 1935 and 1936, the highway's alignment through Norman was modified; it was extended from its Main Street terminus to US-77. Also in 1936, SH-74 began expanding northward. On August 18, the designation was added to a new section of highway between Crescent and US-64 (now State Highway 164) in Covington. Nearly a year later, the route was extended southward again. The State Highway Commission lengthened SH-74 through Goldsby and Purcell to SH-19 in Maysville on July 1, 1937. The section of highway from Covington to US-60 in Lamont was added on April 14, 1941. On June 5, 1945, it was extended further south to SH-29 in Elmore City (at the time simply named Elmore). Throughout the 1950s, State Highway 74 continued to be realigned and extended. Southwest of Norman, it swapped routings with SH-9 on December 6, 1954. SH-74 was extended twice in 1957, once in each direction: to the north on February 18 and to the south on June 10. The 1957 lengthening brought SH-74 to its greatest length, with its present-day northern terminus and a southern terminus at State Highway 53 near Milo. By 1967, I-35 had been constructed through Oklahoma City. On January 4, 1967, SH-74 was split into two sections, with the removal of the section between Goldsby and Norman. The southern section was truncated on December 12, 1974, bringing the highway to its current southern terminus. The gap between the two sections of SH-74 was widened on March 3, 1975, when the route was eliminated through Cleveland County and much of Oklahoma City, bringing SH-74 to its present-day termini. The Lake Hefner Parkway opened in 1992. SH-74 was transferred to the new freeway on April 6. Between April and July 2001, ODOT installed a Brifen Safety Fence cable barrier along the Lake Hefner Parkway section of SH-74. This installation was the first application of this barrier design in the United States. The freeway was extended from its former terminus just north of the Kilpatrick Turnpike to 164th Street in 2016. Spurs SH-74 currently has five spur routes (starting at B, and going up to a suffix of F). Prior to 2009, SH-74A served as a spur route in Norman as well, though it did not intersect SH-74. =SH-74A= SH-74A ran along Lindsey Street in Norman, connecting I-35 to Classen Boulevard, the contemporary routing of US-77. This highway ran straight through the University of Oklahoma (OU) campus. It was long. SH-74A was established by action of the Highway Commission on September 23, 1936. The highway's original extent was from SH-9/SH-74 (24th Avenue S.W.) to the OU campus, ending at Jenkins Avenue. It was later extended to I-35 in the west and US-77 in the east. It was removed by January 2010. =SH-74B= SH-74B connects SH-74 in Goldsby to SH-76 south of Blanchard. Cole lies along the middle of this hilly spur. =SH-74C= SH-74C connects SH-74 in Crescent to US-77 north of Guthrie. =SH-74D= SH-74D connected SH-74 to the unincorporated community of Lovell. It was eliminated from the state highway system on March 5, 2018. =SH-74E= SH-74E goes from SH-51 north to Marshall, and then it goes east and ends at SH-74. This spur was commissioned on 1951-08-06. =SH-74F= SH-74F goes from SH-74 west to Cashion, and then goes north to SH-33.

It was filmed as the sixth and final part of the Love Cinema series consisting of six straight-to-video releases by independent filmmakers via a brief but exclusive run at the minuscule Shimokitazawa cinema in Tokyo. The six films were conceived as low budget exercises to explore the benefits afforded by the low-cost digital video medium such as the increased mobility of the camera and the low-lighting conditions available to the filmmakers. Visitor Q often replicates the style of documentary footage and home movies, which invokes a sense of realism that contradicts the film's more bizarre elements and black comedy. Plot The film's plot is often compared to Pier Paolo Pasolini's Teorema, in which a strange visitor to a wealthy family seduces the maid, the son, the mother, the daughter, and finally the father, before leaving a few days after, subsequently changing their lives. The film starts off with a question: \\"Have you ever done it with your Dad?\\"; the viewer then sees Miki Yamazaki, a young prostitute, trying to persuade her father, Kiyoshi, into having sex with her. Her father is videotaping the scene for a documentary he is preparing on Japanese youths. Once it appears the father is letting himself be persuaded, she tells him the price (50,000 Yen). They have sex, the father ejaculates after a very short time, and the disappointed daughter informs him it will be 100,000 Yen now, because of this. The father then realizes the camera has been on all along. In the next scene, called \\"Have you ever been hit on the head?\\", a man (Visitor Q) hits the father over the head with a rock for no apparent reason. The film then moves on to a scene titled \\"Have you ever hit your mom?\\" In this scene, the mother, Keiko, is working on a jigsaw puzzle, and her hands are shown to have red marks, showing where she has been beaten. Her teenage son, Takuya, comes in and starts throwing things at the already broken apartment walls because he is unhappy with the toothbrush his mother bought him. He then hits his mother with a rug beater. Later, bullies from the son's school come to the front of the house and shoot fireworks through the son's bedroom window. The mother is later seen injecting heroin. It does not seem to have a huge effect on her, though, suggesting she is a regular user. On his way back from work, the father is yet again hit on the head by the same man. They both arrive at the father's home, and the mother serves them dinner. The father announces that the man will be staying with the family for a while. The son comes down while they are eating and starts beating the mother again. This does not surprise or bother the father or the visitor. Later, the father is seen watching one of his old tapes, and it turns out that he was raped by a group of teenagers. The next day, the father is on his way to work when he sees his son being beaten and robbed by some of his schoolmates. He films it from a distance and appears very pleased with the footage. The mother, meanwhile, is getting ready for work. The viewer discovers her body is covered in marks from where the son has hurt her. She also has a limp. The father meets with a female co-worker (Asako Murata), who believes he is going too far in his work. The mother, working as a prostitute, is whipping a customer with a belt (at his request). She then goes to a park to buy some drugs. When she gets home, she discovers the pieces from her jigsaw puzzle have been arranged so as to form a trail through the house, ending at a photograph of her daughter. The visitor is at home, and he introduces her to lactation sex (squeezing her nipples to make her lactate, a recurring theme in this film). The son sees this while hiding behind the door. At dinner, the mother is much happier than usual and has prepared a nice meal. The son, however, is sullen and throws a bowl of hot soup at her face. The wife, instead of being downtrodden as usual, comes back with a carving knife and throws it at the head of her son, who dodges just in time. Everyone is very pleased, except the son. However, the father becomes exhilarated when his son's schoolmates start attacking his house with fireworks again, which he videotapes. Meanwhile, the mother and the visitor continue to eat peacefully. Next day, the son is bullied again. The father is taping his son from his car with the visitor and his female co-worker. The co-worker gets fed up with the father and tries to leave. The father follows her on foot and sexually assaults her while the visitor, emotionally neutral, tapes the scene. The father unintentionally chokes his victim to death. He takes her body back home and puts her in the greenhouse. The visitor is still taping, at the father's instruction. The father sends the visitor to get garbage bags from the mother. But when the visitor asks her for them, she takes her clothes off and reveals she is dressed in a garbage bag. She then makes herself lactate and produces a rain of human milk that covers the floor while the visitor watches from underneath an umbrella. During this time, the husband is drawing on the woman's body to mark the best places to cut it up so the smaller pieces will fit in the bags. He tapes this for his documentary. Becoming aroused, the father has sex with the dead body. He then notices she is getting wet and is amazed that this is possible for a dead woman. When he brings his hand up, however, it is covered in feces. He then discovers that his penis is stuck inside the corpse due to rigor mortis. The mother comes out to help and rushes to the shop to buy much vinegar. She empties the bottles into the bath with her husband and the corpse. This does not help, though, so she gives him a shot of heroin, which frees him. They are both exhilarated. The visitor has filmed the whole scene. Later on, the couple is having fun dismembering the female co-worker's corpse when the son turns up in the front yard with the same schoolmates beating him. The parents rush out, and with great pleasure they finally kill all the bullies using the saws and knives they were using to cut the co-worker's body to pieces. Later, their son is shown lying on the floor in the puddle of maternal milk. He thanks the visitor for bringing together the family through the chaos he brought. The visitor leaves the family. Afterwards, encountering and being propositioned by the prostitute daughter on the street, he appears to be about to hit her on the head with a rock, and does so offscreen. Bruised by her encounter with the visitor, the daughter returns home, and she and her father share a nursing session on the mother.

The county board is also responsible for the London county teams. The county football team compete in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship on an annual basis, the only English based team to do so. They participate through in the Connacht Senior Football Championship as the Irish community in London are considered as part of the province of Connacht. In hurling, London have competed in the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship, but having been relegated during the preliminary group stage of the Leinster Championship in the 2014 season, they currently play in the third tier Christy Ring Cup. Overview London played in three hurling and five football All Ireland finals in the early 1900s when the All-Ireland and All-Britain champions were paired in the final. London won the hurling All-Ireland in 1901, defeating Cork by 1-5 to 0-4. The experiment was abandoned after 1908. Tim Doody, a native of Tournafulla Co Limerick, played in both All Ireland Finals, with London, on the same day in 1901, a record unlikely to be broken anytime soon. The early London teams of that era drew strongly on immigrants from the Cork area in particular. Sam Maguire, who captained many of the teams, came from Dunmanway. The GAA later named the All-Ireland Football Championship's trophy in his honour.

London now fields its second team in the British Junior football and hurling Championships. Their first football team have competed in the Connacht Senior Football Championship since 1975, but in the first 37 years of competing could only manage one win: a 0-9 to 0-6 defeat of Leitrim in 1977. After going down by 9-19 to 1-10 against Roscommon in 1980 they staged matches at home in Ruislip and came close to victory against Leitrim in 1987, Sligo in 1988 and Roscommon in 2005. Among their footballers was Brian Grealish, whose brother Tony played association football for the Republic of Ireland. Due to the Foot and Mouth crisis in England, London withdrew from the 2001 Connacht Senior Football Championship; their first round championship fixture against Mayo was cancelled until the 2006 fixture between the teams. In June 2011, London were defeated in extra-time against Mayo in the Connacht Championship, London entered the first qualifying round and defeated Fermanagh by 0-15 to 0-9 in Ruislip in the first round of the qualifiers, recording their first championship win for 34 years. London were drawn against Waterford for their second qualifying round match. In 2013, the GAA banned London from travelling to Ireland for warm-up games, as a result of a GAA rule put in place to prevent teams travelling abroad for training camps in the run up to the championship, putting them at a major disadvantage to other counties. On 26 May 2013, London defeated Sligo by a scoreline of 1-12 to 0-14 to gain their first victory in the Connacht Championship since 1977. Lorcan Mulvey scored the vital London goal. The day after they defeated Sligo was a bank holiday in England so the players rested. London held Leitrim in the Connacht semi-final then won the replay. After these three games they headed for the Connacht final - their first appearance at that level - but lost to Mayo. They arrived in Ireland for the final on a specially charted jet. Thus they entered Round 4 of the Qualifiers for the All-Ireland Series - also their first time to feature there. They drew Cavan, their first Championship meeting with them and the game was set for Croke Park, another historic occasion for London. Cavan won by a score of 1-17 to 1-08 to proceed to the All-Ireland quarter-finals. Lorcan Mulvey was later nominated for an All Star, but was not selected. In 2018, London fielded a record six London-born starters in their championship line-up in their defeat to Sligo in the Connacht Senior Football Championship, with a further two on the bench. Roscommon playing London in the Connacht Championship moved from 2020 to 2021, Mayo moved from to 2021 to 2022, Leitrim 2022 to 2023, Sligo 2023 to 2024 and Galway 2024 to 2025 due to COVID 19. Hurling =Clubs= London Senior Hurling Championship =County team= London have a strong hurling tradition, and besides their All-Ireland win in 1901 they have also won three B All-Irelands in the last twenty years, and claim consistently good results in the National Hurling League. As a mid-table Division 2 side, London are actually placed above half the counties of Ireland, in strong contrast to their role as \\"whipping boys\\" in football. The Exiles also won the inaugural Nicky Rackard Cup in 2005, defeating Louth's hurlers by 15 points in the final. London competed in the 2013 Senior All Ireland Championship, facing Carlow in their opening match. In the 1973 All- Ireland Hurling Championship, a London team that included six Galwaymen beat Galway by 4-7 to 3-5 in the All-Ireland quarter-final at Ballinasloe. Galwaymen Frank Canning and Lennie Burke scored three of the goals against their old county. London won the 2012 Christy Ring Cup which allowed them to compete in the 2013 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. They made their Leinster Senior Hurling Championship debut against Carlow on 18 May 2013 in the 2014 Championship. The London county hurling team finished bottom of the preliminary group after being beaten by Westmeath in the final game of the round robin stage, and were relegated back to the Christy Ring Cup for the 2015 season. London's hurlers are currently managed by Shane Kelly. =Honours= *All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championships: 1 **1901 *All-Ireland Senior B Hurling Championships: 5 **1985, 1987, 1988, 1990, 1995 *All-Ireland Junior Hurling Championships: 5 **1938, 1949, 1959, 1960, 1963 * Christy Ring Cups: 1 ** 2012 * Nicky Rackard Cups: 2 ** 2005, 2011 * Kehoe Cups: 2 ** 1987, 1988 Ladies' football =History= Ladies' football in London has mirrored the growth seen in Ireland, where it is the fastest growing ladies' game.

Glitz is a rogue from the planet Salostophus in the Andromeda Constellation. Glitz's first love is money, and he is often engaged in mercenary acts and profiteering. The character was created by writer Robert Holmes. Character history The Sixth Doctor and Peri Brown encounter Glitz and his fellow mercenary Dibber on the planet Ravalox (The Mysterious Planet). Ravalox is really Earth around 2,000,000 AD, having been moved two light years by the Time Lords. Glitz and Dibber are on Ravalox looking for secrets stolen by the Sleepers of Andromeda from the Matrix on Gallifrey. The secrets are guarded by an L-3 robot named Drathro. Glitz plans to destroy the Black Light system that fuels Drathro and then steal the secrets. When Dibber destroys the external collection aerial, the system becomes dangerously unstable, and only the Doctor's intervention prevents a potentially catastrophic explosion. Nearing the end of the Doctor's trial, Glitz is summoned to the Gallifreyan space station by his business partner ‚Äî the Master. The Master reveals that the events on Ravalox were engineered by the Time Lords to cover up the theft of the secrets. As the trial dissolves into chaos, Glitz accompanies the Doctor into the fictional reality of the Matrix to fight the Valeyard. The Master bribes Glitz to betray the Doctor, but in turn is tricked by the Valeyard. Given what he thinks are the true secrets of the Matrix, the Master tries to upload them into his TARDIS's systems, causing the Master and Glitz to be paralysed within the TARDIS. After the Doctor finally defeats the Valeyard, he requests that the Time Lords show leniency to Glitz. The Doctor, having since regenerated into his seventh persona, next encounters Glitz on Iceworld on the planet Svartos (Dragonfire), where Glitz has become indebted to the power-mad Kane as a result of a failed fraud and gambling losses. After hearing about a fabulous treasure known as the Dragonfire, Glitz accompanies the Seventh Doctor, Ace and Melanie Bush in their search, hoping to keep it for himself. He doesn't realize that Kane has installed a tracking device on the map. The Dragonfire turns out to be part of a large bio-mechanoid dragon, which in turn is revealed to be Kane's jailer on the planet Svartos. After the bio-mechanoid is destroyed, Kane uses the Dragonfire to power the Iceworld systems intending to escape. He also has his mercenaries drive the occupants of Iceworld onto Glitz's ship, the Nosferatu, which he subsequently destroys. Eager for revenge, Glitz goes to find Kane, and meets The Doctor, Ace and Mel in the control room of Iceworld. Iceworld is revealed to be a massive spaceship, with which Kane intends to make his escape and seek revenge on his home planet from which he was banished three thousand years earlier. However, with the systems now fully powered, the Doctor uses Iceworld's star charts to reveal to Kane that his homeworld had been destroyed when its sun went supernova two thousand years earlier. Kane then kills himself with unfiltered sunlight, and Glitz steals the ship, which he renames Nosferatu II. To the Doctor's surprise, Mel elects to leave the TARDIS and travel with Glitz. Production notes The original outline by Ian Briggs for the Seventh Doctor serial The Curse of Fenric made a reference to Ace not being a virgin, but this was removed for the final production. Briggs, who had created the character of Ace, had stated in Ace's character outline for Dragonfire that she had slept with Glitz on Iceworld.About Time ‚Äì The Unauthorized Guide to Dr. Who ‚Äì Volume 6 (Seasons 22 to 26 and TV Movie) by Tat Wood, Mad Norwegian Press, 2015, , Dragonfire entry.

Each national Scout organization determines the manner in which the emblem is worn. Origins of the design 1920-1939 version of the emblem, used by Lord Baden-Powell Lord Baden-Powell began awarding a brass badge in the shape of the fleur-de-lis arrowhead to army scouts whom he had trained while serving in India in 1897. He later issued a copper fleur-de-lis badge to all participants of the experimental camp on Brownsea Island in 1907. Baden- Powell included a design for the Scout's badge in his work, Scouting for Boys, which was a simple fleur-de-lis with the motto \\"Be Prepared\\" on a scroll below it. He reasoned that the fleur-de-lis was commonly used as the symbol for north on maps, and a Boy Scout was to show the way in doing his duty and helping others. The plumes of the fleur-de-lis became symbols for Service to Others, Duty to God, and Obedience to the Scout Law. These three principles form the Scout Promise which is made by new Scouts as they join the movement. The fleur-de-lis was modified shortly after, to include the two five-pointed stars, which symbolize knowledge and truth. A \\"bond\\" was also added tying the three plumes together to symbolize the family of Scouting. 1939-1955 version of the emblem, used by the World Scout Committee J. S. Wilson introduced an international Scout badge in 1939-a silver fleur-de-lis on a purple background surrounded by the names of the five continents in silver within a circular frame. The wearing of it was not universal, but was confined to past and present members of the International Committee and staff of the Bureau. A flag of similar design followed, the flying of which was restricted to international Scout gatherings. The current emblem design was introduced at the 8th World Scout Jamboree in 1955 by former Boy Scouts of Greece National Commissioner Demetrios Alexatos.John S. Wilson (1959), Scouting Round the World. First edition, Blandford Press. p. 268 The final design which is now worn on the uniforms of Scouts around the world includes a rope which encircles the fleur-de-lis and is tied in a reef knot at the bottom of the badge. The rope is there to symbolize the family of the World Scout Movement and the knot symbolizes the strength of the unity of the World Scout Movement. The colors chosen have heraldic significance, with the white of the arrowhead and rope representing purity, and the royal purple denoting leadership and service. The use of the fleur-de-lis has led to some controversy, with critics citing its military symbolism. However, Robert Baden-Powell himself denied this link, writing and speaking about the various other meanings of the symbol. Organization usage Several of the national Scout organizations use the emblem in various ways. =The Scout Association= The Scout Association refers to the emblem as the World Membership Badge. It is used as the joining award for each section‚ÄîBeavers, Cubs, Scouts, Explorer Scouts and Scout Network‚Äîwith requirements intended to help the Scout understand their commitment to Scouting. =Boy Scouts of America= The Boy Scouts of America (BSA) refers to the emblem as the World Crest; it may be worn on the uniform as an emblem of worldwide Scouting. The BSA first used the badge as an award for Scouts and Scouters who participated in an international Scouting event from early 1956 through 1991; requirements were devised by each council. In 1991, the BSA made it part of the uniform for all Scouts and the International Activity Patch replaced the World Scout Crest as an award. =Scouts South Africa= Scouts South Africa uses this badge when new members join, either as a Cub, a Scout or an Adult Leader. The badge is worn on the left front pocket of the uniform, over the heart. The five-pointed stars of the fleur-de-lis are often explained to be symbolic of the ten points of the Scout Promise.

In 2007, Queen Sonja of Norway unveiled Per Ung's statue of Foss outside Norway's National Theater. She was awarded the Ibsen Centennial Commemoration Award in 2006. On 2 December 2010, Wenche Foss announced that she was seriously ill and did not expect to live past New Year. She died in her sleep on 28 March 2011 at Diakonhjemmet Hospital in Oslo, surrounded by her family. Her death saw an outpour of public grief and tributes rarely bestowed upon civilians. The Norwegian government announced she would be buried with government honour at state expense, the fifth woman in Norwegian history to be given this respect. The funeral was broadcast live on national television, 4 April 2011, and was, in keeping with Foss' own wishes, open to the public. It was also attended by King Harald and Queen Sonja of Norway, as well as Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg and other prominent members of government. Foss is depicted on the tail fin of a Norwegian Air Shuttle Boeing 737-800, with the registration EI-FHY.

The company is owned by Meditor. History The company was established by Lord Harris of Peckham in November 1988, when he opened the first shop in Canning Town.Carpetright History It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in June 1993. It bought selected shops of Carpetland, and Allied Carpets, in January 1999. It acquired its first operations in Continental Europe in August 2002, and in August 2005, it acquired May‚Äôs World of Carpets. Cascade Investment, LLC, the investment vehicle of Bill Gates, acquired their stake of 3% in the company, in May 2008. In December 2008, the company acquired some shops, once associated with Sleepright UK. Carpetright announced significant shop closure plans in June 2011, and in December 2011, it posted its first loss since 1993. It was reported, on 21 March 2018, that Carpetright was struggling, after issuing several profit warnings, and that it was looking at possible shop closures. On 12 April 2018, it was announced that Carpetright would close ninety two stores, with a total loss of three hundred jobs, out of the total workforce of 2,700, as part of their restructuring measure. It was announced, on 11 May 2018, that Carpetright secured a ¬£15 million loan, to provide short term working capital. In November 2019, Carpetright announced that their largest shareholder, Meditor, had agreed to purchase the company. The cut price ¬£15.2m bid was accepted by the company, amid fears it cannot pay off its debt pile. Carpetright have estimated that the company would need around ¬£80 million to get out of its debt problems. The company‚Äôs gross debt was evaluated at ¬£56 million. According to Carpetright, the rescue deal will help the company complete a turnaround plan in the ‚Äúvery challenging consumer market‚Äù. The hedge fund, that will acquire the retailer, is headed by Talal Shakerchi, the former professional poker player, and the former fund manager for Old Mutual. Investec Asset Management backed the bid, made by Meditor, with more than 11.3 million shares. Carpetright announced the departure of chairman Bob Ivell in January 2020, as the store returns to private ownership, after twenty six years. A number of non executive directors, including Jemima Bird, Pauline Best and David Clifford, have now stood down from the board of Carpetright, consequently because of the takeover. Operations The company now has over four hundred shops. It has expanded into Belgium, the Netherlands, and the Republic of Ireland. Their products include a wide variety of beds, mattresses, carpets, laminate flooring, vinyl flooring and rugs. Marketing Carpetright announced a new partnership in July 2016, with Lucy Alexander as their brand ambassador. It was announced, in March 2020, that Carpetright would become the new main shirt sponsors for Exeter City F.C., commencing from the season of 2020/21, replacing the recently collapsed airline, Flybe.

His books include unauthorised biographies of Robert Maxwell, Mohamed Al-Fayed, Conrad Black, Richard Branson, Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson. A book about Richard Desmond remains unpublished. His book, Broken Dreams: Vanity, Greed and the Souring of British Football, won the 2003 William Hill Sports Book of the Year. Biography Thomas Bauer (as he then was) was born in London in 1946. His parents were Jewish refugees who fled Prague after the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in March 1939 and arrived in London later that same year. They married in London in early 1943. From 1948, Tom's father Jiri Gerhard Bauer renounced the use of the surname Bauer for the family, and called himself George Gerald Bower, a change he confirmed by deed poll on 15 May 1957.The London Gazette, 7 June 1957, Issue: 41095, Page: 3462 https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/41095/page/3462 After attending the William Ellis School in Hampstead, Bower studied law at the London School of Economics, before working as a barrister for the National Council of Civil Liberties. Bower says that during this period he was a Marxist, being nicknamed \\"Tommy the Red\\". In 1970, Bower joined the BBC as a researcher on the programme 24 Hours before becoming a reporter on Panorama. He was a producer on Panorama from 1975 until 1987. He left the BBC in 1995. Bower is married to Veronica Wadley, Baroness Fleet, former editor of the London Evening Standard, and has four children. They live in London. Books and journalism Bower's first book was Blind Eye to Murder (1980), the first expos√© based on eyewitnesses and newly released archives in London and Washington of the Allied failure after 1945 to hunt down Nazi war criminals and de-Nazify West Germany. The book was serialised for 5 days in The Times and was the basis of a BBC TV documentary. Bower's second book was Klaus Barbie: The Butcher of Lyon (1984) which documented Klaus Barbie's war crimes during World War II as head of the Gestapo in Lyon, Germany and his post-war work for the American intelligence agency Counterintelligence Corps (CIC) and South American narcotics and arms dealers. Bower's book was serialised in The Times in September 1983.Tom Bower. \\"On the butcher's block.\\", The Times, London, 19 September 1983, pg 12. Neal Ascherson positively reviewed the book in The Observer in January 1984.Neil Ascherson, \\"Doing the dirty work.\\", The Observer, London, 29 January 1984, pg 52. =Robert Maxwell= In 1987, Robert Maxwell responded to the publication of two unauthorised biographies of himself with numerous lawsuits, threats of legal action against individual booksellers, and the rapid publication of an authorised biography by Joe Haines, political editor of the Mirror Group which Maxwell owned. Of the two unauthorised books, Maxwell: A Portrait of Power by Peter Thompson and Anthony Delano was withdrawn from sale and all unsold copies pulped after Maxwell successfully sued the publishers and authors for libel. The second book, Maxwell: The Outsider by Bower sold out in hardback but Maxwell prevented the paperback edition appearing, in part by buying the publishing company which held the paperback rights. Maxwell also filed a libel action against Bower and the hardback publishers, Aurum Press. Maxwell allowed this action to lapse in 1990 but only after Bower and Aurum had submitted a detailed defence of the book. Maxwell also tried to sue Bower in the English courts over an article published in America, by the magazine The New Republic, on the basis that it had 136 British subscribers. Bower also believes that Maxwell tried to break into his house and also went through his phone records and bank statements. =Richard Branson= In 2000, Richard Branson sued Bower for libel over an article he had written for the London Evening Standard in 1999. Branson chose not to sue the paper, but its editor, Max Hastings, agreed the newspaper would fund Bower's defence. Branson lost the case, and later expressed regret at bringing the action. Bower continues to write articles critical of Branson's business affairs, and published biographies of him in 2000 and 2014. =Geoffrey Robinson MP= In 2001, Bower published The Paymaster: Geoffrey Robinson, Maxwell and New Labour, a biography of the Labour MP Geoffrey Robinson. The book's evidence that Robinson had solicited a ¬£200,000 business contract from Robert Maxwell led to Robinson being suspended from Parliament for three weeks as he had not disclosed the matter to an inquiry some years previously. Robinson denied receiving the money in question from Maxwell and denied that he had sought to mislead Parliament. =English football= In 2003, Bower won the William Hill Sports Book of the Year Award for Broken Dreams: Vanity, Greed and the Souring of British Football, an investigation into corruption in English football. =Conrad Black = Bower's joint biography of Conrad Black and Barbara Amiel Conrad and Lady Black: Dancing on the Edge was published in November 2006. In February 2007, Black filed a libel suit in Toronto against Bower over the contents of the book. The suit was frozen when Black was convicted of fraud and imprisoned. =Richard Desmond= The Daily Express proprietor Richard Desmond brought a libel action against Bower over a passing reference in Dancing on the Edge. Desmond claimed that the book included an account of an incident that weakened his \\"super-tough\\" reputation as a businessman and was therefore defamatory. Bower denied libel on the grounds of the story being \\"substantially true\\". The action was heard in July 2009 and Desmond lost the case. An unauthorised biography by Bower of Richard Desmond, titled Rough Trader, was written and printed in 2006, but still awaits publication. =Latest works= In 2011 Bower published a biography of the Formula One executive Bernie Ecclestone titled No Angel: The Secret Life of Bernie Ecclestone. Ecclestone cooperated with Bower in the writing of the book, facilitating introductions to people for Bower. Over lunch Ecclestone told Bower \\"You write what you like, provided it's more or less the truth, because I'm no angel\\". Ecclestone's quote provided the title for the book. Ecclestone became friends with Bower and would say to him \\"What can I do that's evil for you?\\" Bower's biography of the music executive and entertainment impresario Simon Cowell, Sweet Revenge: The Intimate Life of Simon Cowell, was written with Cowell's co-operation and published in April 2012. Cowell later said that Ecclestone had advised him to co-operate with Bower. The title of the book refers to Cowell's relationship with fellow entertainment impresario Simon Fuller. Though Cowell had given Bower some 200 hours of access to him, Bower subsequently said that Cowell had tried to restrict his access to sources. Cowell contacted Bower after the book's publication to say that he had found it \\"a bit embarrassing\\", adding \\"you got things I didn't know you'd got.\\" Bower has secured Cowell's co-operation for a planned sequel to the book. Bower's book, Broken Vows ‚Äì Tony Blair: The Tragedy of Power, was published in March 2016. Bower's book, \\"Rebel Prince\\" describing Prince Charles's attempts amid huge controversy to recover his popularity after the death of Princess Diana was a Number 1 best seller in the Sunday Times list and was serialised in the Daily Mail. In 2019, a biography of Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn, Dangerous Hero, was published. Serialised at length in the Mail on Sunday, it was a number 2 Sunday Times bestseller. The book accused Jeremy Corbyn of being an anti-Semitic Marxist. The book has been seriously criticised by Peter Oborne, writing in Middle East Eye, for its lack of referencing, alleged factual errors and the systematic omittance of relevant facts. Stephen Bush, writing in The Guardian, referred to the book as a \\"hatchet job\\" littered with \\"rudimentary errors\\" and journalist Oscar Rickett called it \\"garbage\\". In the book, he made false allegations against the Palestinian Return Centre. Along with the publisher Harper Collins he made a full, unqualified withdrawal of the allegations, but neither apologised nor paid any money to the complainant or the lawyers. The allegations are to be removed from all future editions of the book. The Mail on Sunday and MailOnline who serialised the book had to pay full damages and issue a written apology. The biography Boris Johnson: The Gambler has been published by WH Allen the 15th of October 2020 and has been noted for being sympathetic about the subject of the biography, in contrast with some of Bower's previous works.

Trudeau accuses pharmaceutical companies and the United States government of censoring these products and methods on the basis that it would cut into their profit-margin. The book is the subject of widespread allegations of fraud.  Premise  In the book, Trudeau claims that there are all-natural cures for serious illnesses including cancer, herpes, arthritis, AIDS, acid reflux disease, various phobias, depression, obesity, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, lupus, chronic fatigue syndrome, attention deficit disorder, muscular dystrophy, and that these are being deliberately hidden and suppressed from the public by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Federal Trade Commission, and the major food and drug companies, in an effort to protect the profits of these industries and the authority of the governmental agencies. Trudeau claims that the source of illness are toxins from processed food, nutritional deficiencies, and other environmental sources; and that eliminating these factors will facilitate a cure for most diseases. Trudeau claims that his lack of medical training or expertise is what makes him most qualified to investigate alternative medicine, and reports his opinions in his self-published book. The first edition of the book lacked any mention of specific, brand-name products for any illnesses within its pages, as Trudeau claims the FDA and FTC censored this information and prohibited him from publishing it in the book. Instead, the book contained references to Trudeau's subscription-based website where the actual 'cures' were supposedly posted and accessible for a monthly fee. In May 2006, Trudeau self-published More Natural \\"Cures\\" Revealed: Previously Censored Brand Name Products That Cure Disease. This book responded to complaints that its earlier version did not actually contain any cures but pointed consumers to his subscription website. In More Natural \\"Cures\\" Revealed, Trudeau says that workers at the FDA and FTC want to censor him and, figuratively, burn his books.  Versions  The original book contained 271 pages. After he released More Natural \\"Cures\\" Revealed: Previously Censored Brand Name Products That Cure Disease in response to earlier criticism, an \\"Updated Edition\\" of the original Natural Cures was sold shortly thereafter, containing 563 pages. This adds a new Introduction, a Frequently Asked Questions chapter and a chapter on website information. It also adds three appendices, containing newsletter articles, \\"No-Hunger Bread: A True FDA Horror Story,\\" and locations of several health care practitioners. The FDA article, originally a short letter and summary of the case in the original book, is included in its entirety in the updated edition. One omission in the updated edition is a Glossary section containing several New Age techniques. According to Trudeau, the chapter \\"The Cures For All Diseases\\" was completely censored by the FTC in the original book. The chapter is included titled as \\"Natural Cures for Specific Diseases\\" in the updated edition. His website contains a number of references and articles, notably \\"FDA Horror Stories\\" such as \\"No-Hunger Bread,\\" which describe alleged instances of the FDA suppressing natural cures. Another article addresses 714X, a disproven cancer treatment developed in Canada.  Criticism  The book has been the focus of much controversy since its publication, with widespread allegations of fraud. The New York State Consumer Protection Board issued a warning in 2005 that the book \\"does not contain the 'natural cures' for cancer and other diseases that Trudeau is promising.\\" It asserted that \\"Trudeau is not only misrepresenting the contents of his self-published book, he is also using false endorsements to encourage consumers to buy Natural Cures \\"They\\" Don‚Äôt Want You to Know About.\\" Cancer ‚ÄòCures‚Äô Are Empty Promises in Kevin Trudeau‚Äôs ‚ÄòNatural Cures‚Äô Book. New York State Consumer Protection Board News Release, August 5, 2005. The Board also alleged that Trudeau was selling the consumer's contact information to other marketers without their consent and hitting purchasers with unauthorized charges.Without Notice to Consumers, Kevin Trudeau is Selling Consumer Names and Addresses from Infomercial Orders - Consumers Also Hit with Unexpected Charges for Trudeau Newsletter and Discount Purchase Program.

Others have criticized the book for making such claims as, \\"If your body is alkaline, you cannot get cancer [...] and if you have cancer, it goes away.\\"Kevin Trudeai's Snake Oil Empire The book makes extensive unreferenced claims that some drugs cause such conditions as AIDS, headaches, bloating, indigestion, heartburn, nausea, allergies, asthma, fibromyalgia, arthritis, diabetes, constipation, yeast infections, dandruff, acne, halitosis, fatigue, depression, stress, and inability to lose weight.

The main purpose being the encouragement of activism within the lesbian community. Dyke marches commonly take place the Friday or Saturday before LGBT pride parades. Larger metropolitan areas usually have several Pride-related happenings (picnics, workshops, arts festivals, parties, benefits, dances, bar events) both before and after the march to further community building; with outreach to specific segments such as older women, women of color, and lesbian parenting groups. Dyke Marches are now held in Berlin and London in Europe; Calgary, Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver, and Winnipeg in Canada; as well as Atlanta, Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, Long Beach, Minneapolis, New York City, Oakland, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Portland (Oregon), San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Washington, D.C., West Hollywood, and other cities in the United States. History Dyke March, Boston, USA, 2008 Before the concept of a \\"Dyke March\\" came to be, one of the first documented lesbian pride marches in North America took place in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, in May 1981. Approximately 200 lesbians attending the fifth Bi-National Lesbian Conference marched through downtown streets chanting \\"Look over here, look over there, lesbians are everywhere!\\" Later, in October 1981, the now-defunct organization Lesbians Against the Right held a \\"Dykes in the Streets\\" march in Toronto, Ontario, with lesbian power, pride, and visibility as the theme. 350 women participated in the demonstration. The first Dyke March was formed in Washington D.C., during the March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay and Bi Equal Rights and Liberation, and held on April 24, 1993. Organized by the Lesbian Avengers, over 20,000 women participated in the march. Most Dyke Marches today occur in the month of June during Pride celebrations, which generally transpire around the anniversary of the Stonewall riots on June 28, 1969. Dyke March events The reason for the creation of the various Dyke Marches was to protest what many women saw as the control of Gay Pride events by white gay men at the expense of lesbians in general and women of color in particular. =Europe= Germany Dyke March, Berlin, Germany, 2018 There is a yearly Dyke March in Hamburg and Cologne, Germany. Since 2017 also in Heidelberg, and since 2018 in Oldenburg. The Berlin Dyke March has been in operation since 2013 in the LGBT-friendly neighborhood of Kreuzberg. The march occurs annually in June, on the day before the Berlin Pride Parade. United Kingdom The London Dyke March was first organized in 2012 and is held each year in June. The 2012 march featured speakers, including a representative from the Safra Project, a charity for Muslim LBT women, and Sarah Brown, a transgender lesbian activist and former Lib Dem councilor. The London Dyke March emphasizes diversity, including bois, queers, femmes, butches, and lipstick lesbians. =North America= United States =Chicago= The Chicago Dyke March is held in the month of June and has been in operation since 1995, beginning in the LGBT-friendly neighborhood of Andersonville. Many participants consider it \\"a chance to celebrate ourselves as women, as lesbians, and to show the community that we are here.\\" In 2008, organizers of the Chicago Dyke March announced that it would remain in a new location for two consecutive years. The location of the march changed every two to three years to increase visibility throughout all neighborhoods of Chicago. The March was held in Pilsen in 2008 and 2009, in South Shore in 2010 and 2011, in Uptown in 2012 and 2013, in Humboldt Park in 2014, 2015 and 2016, and in La Villita in 2017. =New York= 19th NYC Dyke March, New York, USA, 2011 Separate Lesbian Pride marches were held in New York City in the 1970s, but they did not become a continuous tradition. The Dyke March was renewed by the NY Chapter of the Lesbian Avengers in June 1993, after the success of the Dyke March in Washington. As time passed, many members of the Lesbian Avengers became concerned that New York's Gay Pride March was losing its political edge as it became more accepted by the city and courted by corporations. On the Saturday before Pride, participants gather in Bryant Park as they prepare to march down Fifth Avenue towards Washington Square Park. The Dyke March is open to everyone who identifies as a 'dyke'. Because of this, allies and others who do not identify as 'dykes' have been asked to stand on the sidewalks and cheer on the marchers. Each year approximately 15,000 women attend this event. As with the San Francisco Dyke March, the organizers do not seek out a permit, and put emphasis on the political. Even though there are many club nights and parties after the March, the event is not so much about entertainment as it is about highlighting the presence of self-identified women within the LGBT community. =San Francisco= Front of Dyke March parade, San Francisco, USA, 2019 The first San Francisco Dyke March was held in June 1993, and is celebrated every year on the last Saturday in June. The march begins in Mission Dolores Park with speeches, performances, and community networking; and ends in the Castro District. The Dyke March is informal, with marchers creating their own signs and most people showing up to participate, rather than to just watch. The San Francisco Dyke March has high attendance numbers. The streets along the march route are lined with enthusiastic spectators in support of the women. Until 2018, it remained a relatively peaceful and well-organized event. In the early years, the San Francisco Dyke March Committee (a small group of volunteers) never applied for nor received a permit from the city, exercising the First Amendment right to gather without permits and often changed its route to avoid the police. =Seattle= Dyke March at PrideFest, Seattle, USA, 2017 Seattle's Dyke March occurs the Saturday before Pride and begins with a Rally at 5 pm at Seattle Central Community College, followed by the march through the streets at 7 pm. The rally is held outdoors, includes speakers and performers who are women identified and queer identified, and is ASL interpreted. Since the late 2000s, organizers have filed for a permit. Since about 2007, the march audience has been about 1,000 women, and the permit ensures the streets are clear for marching. =Washington D.C.= The D.C. Dyke March was first organized in April 1993 and thereafter held annually in June until 2007. After a 12-year absence, the march returned in 2019 with \\"Dykes Against Displacement\\" as its theme, in protest of the elimination of low-income housing due to gentrification. The march, however, became mired in controversy resulting from the banning of \\"nationalist symbols\\". Incidents regarding Jewish pride flags Jewish Pride flag. Gay Pride parade, Paris, France (2014) =2017 Chicago= In 2017, Chicago Dyke March (CDM) organizers singled out three women carrying Jewish pride flags and began questioning them on their political stance in regards to Zionism and Israel. After a discussion, organizers asked them to leave the event, insisting that the rainbow flag with the Star of David \\"made people feel unsafe\\" and that the Dyke March was \\"pro-Palestinian and anti-Zionist\\". The incident prompted widespread criticism and accusations of anti-Semitism. A member of the Dyke March Chicago collective stated that the women were removed due to the flags, and pro-Palestinian organizations were asked by CDM to release statements of solidarity while they crafted an official statement. March organizers later released a statement maintaining that the women were asked to leave due to their \\"Zionist stance and support for Israel\\", and not the use of Jewish symbols. In 2018, members of the local Jewish LGBT community expressed reluctance to attend that year's march, citing concerns about safety and alienation. =2019 Washington, D.C.= Similar to the 2017 decision made by the Chicago Dyke March, the 2019 Washington D.C. Dyke March adopted a policy that \\"nationalist symbols\\", including Israeli and American flags and the Star of David when centered on a flag, cannot be displayed. Organizers said these symbols represent \\"violent nationalism\\", and said those attending the event should \\"not bring pro-Israel paraphernalia in solidarity with our queer Palestinian friends\\", while \\"Jewish stars and other identifications and celebrations of Jewishness (yarmulkes, talit, other expressions of Judaism or Jewishness) are welcome and encouraged\\". Palestinian flags and symbols were permitted. In response to the policy, Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt stated, \\"It is outrageous that in preparing to celebrate LGBTQ pride, the D.C. Dyke March is forbidding Jewish participants from carrying any flag or sign that includes the Star of David, which is universally recognized as a symbol of the Jewish people....Banning the Star of David in their parade is anti-Semitic, plain and simple.\\" A coalition of progressive Jewish-American groups denounced the ban in a joint statement, and the National LGBTQ Task Force withdrew their support for the D.C. Dyke March. More than two dozen Jewish lesbians and Zionist supporters brought the prohibited flag and symbol to the march. They debated the perceived mistreatment and exclusion with march organizer Jill Raney. Thereafter, D.C. Dyke March organizers allowed the group to participate in the march with their Jewish pride flags.

Draft of the 1536 Treaty or Capitulations negotiated between French ambassador Jean de La For√™t and Ibrahim Pasha, a few days before his assassination, expanding to the whole Ottoman Empire the privileges received in Egypt from the Mamluks before 1518. Capitulation reopening trade between Venice and the Ottoman Empire signed 2 October 1540, following the Battle of Preveza. 1 piaster overprint on 25-centime Type Sage, used at the French Post Office, Beirut in December 1885 Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire were contracts between the Ottoman Empire and European powers, particularly France. Turkish capitulations, or Ahidn√¢mes were generally bilateral acts whereby definite arrangements were entered into by each contracting party towards the other, not mere concessions.As regards technical distinctions, an agreement, an exchange of notes, or a convention properly applies to one specific subject; whereas a treaty usually comprises several matters, whether commercial or political. The Turkish Capitulations were grants made by successive Sultans to Christian nations, conferring rights and privileges in favour of their subjects resident or trading in the Ottoman dominions, following the policy towards European states of the Byzantine Empire. According to these capitulations traders entering the Ottoman Empire were exempt from local prosecution, local taxation, local conscription, and the searching of their domicile. The capitulations were initially made during the Ottoman Empire's military dominance, to entice and encourage commercial exchange with Western merchants. However, after military dominance shifted to Europe, significant economic and political advantages were granted to the European powers by the Ottoman Empire. History In the first instance capitulations were granted separately to each Christian state, beginning with the Genoese in 1453, which entered into peaceful relations with the Ottoman Empire. Afterwards new capitulations were obtained which summed up in one document earlier concessions, and added to them in general terms whatever had been conceded to one or more other states; a stipulation which became a most favored nation article. Around 1535 a capitulation was made by Suleiman the Magnificent regarding France. France signed its first treaty of Capitulations with the Mamluk Sultanate in Cairo in 1500, during the rule of Louis XII.Three years in Constantinople by Charles White p.139Three years in Constantinople by Charles White p.147 After the Turks conquered Egypt in the Ottoman‚ÄìMamluk War (1516‚Äì1517), the Ottomans upheld the capitulations to the French and applied them to the entire empire. The Ottoman-French Treaty of 1740 marked the apogee of French influence in the Ottoman Empire in the eighteenth century. In the following years the French had an unchallenged position in Levant trade and in transportation between Ottoman ports. Near contemporary Ottoman capitulations to European powers such as Britain and Holland (1737), the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (1740), Denmark (1756), and Prussia (1761) were to offset and balance the capitulations granted to France in 1740.Robert Olson, \\"The Ottoman-French Treaty of 1740\\" Turkish Studies Association Bulletin (1991) 15#2 pp. 347-355 online Status Capitulations signified that which was arranged under distinct headings; the Ottoman Turkish phrase was ahid nameh, whereas a \\"treaty\\" was mouahed. The latter did, and the former did not, signify a reciprocal engagement. According to Capitulations, and treaties confirmatory of them, made between the Porte and other states, foreigners resident in Turkey were subject to the laws of their respective countries. Thus, although the Turkish capitulations were not in themselves treaties, yet by subsequent confirmation they acquired the force of commercial durable instead of personal nature; the conversion of permissive into perfect rights; questions as to contraband and neutral trade stated in definite terms. Abolition In 1914, the Committee of Union and Progress abolished the capitulations in the Ottoman Empire and introduced economic policies that would benefit the Ottoman economy. As far as Turkey is concerned, the capitulations were abolished by the Treaty of Lausanne (1923), specifically by Article 28: Capitulations in Egypt ended in 1949 as stipulated in the Montreux Convention Regarding the Abolition of the Capitulations in Egypt in 1937.Convention regarding the Abolition of the Capitulations in Egypt, Protocol, and Declaration by the Royal Egyptian Government (Montreux, 8 May 1936) Art 1.

History =Students= Kennesaw Mountain High School was founded in 2000. The high school, built on a site, was intended to have a capacity of 2,000 students, but due to the rapid population growth in Cobb County, the school quickly became overcrowded. Before the school was built, juniors, as opposed to freshman and sophomores, from Harrison High School (the main output) were given the choice whether to stay at their current school or change to Kennesaw Mountain. Approximately 240 juniors decided to change, which was much more than expected. =Construction= Construction of the five buildings at the campus began in August 1999 and was completed in 14 months. The design, by Passantino & Bavier, Inc., used steel bowstring joists to allow for an arched roofline and the clear span required for the gymnasium.

The American Defense Society was a nationalist American political group founded in 1915. It advocated American intervention against Germany during World War I as well as opposition to the Bolsheviks, who came to power in Russia after the October Revolution of 1917. Formation Clarence Smedley Thomas, Cushing Stetson, and John F. Hubbard formed the ADS in August 1915 as a splinter group from the National Security League (NSL). They objected to the NSL for being uncritical in support of the Wilson administration. Like the NSL, the ADS favored progressivism and its reform programs, but the ADS was much more militarist and nationalistic than the NSL. Its first honorary president was former US President Theodore Roosevelt.New York Times: \\"Theodore Roosevelt to be Honored Today,\\" October 27, 1943, accessed March 30, 2010 The Chairman was Richard Melancthon Hurd. Among the political positions of the ADS were: * Total victory against Germany in World War I, with no discussion of peace terms * Centralized organization of national industry, as accomplished temporarily under the War Industries Board * Expulsion of socialists from US politics * Suppression of sedition * One hundred percent Americanism In February 1918, the Society called on Congress to take action on a series of measures required by US entry into World War I. It wanted an \\"overwhelming force\\" sent to France: \\"the quicker we put our full strength into the war the sooner it will be over.\\" It called for the internment of enemy aliens and sympathizers to prevent sabotage because \\"if enough munition factories are blown up here we shall lose the war.\\"The reference was probably to the sabotage of a New York harbor munitions depot in 1916. It claimed that England saw an end to foreign plots and propaganda after interning 70,000. On the educational and cultural front, the Society was uncompromising: > \\"The appalling and complete breakdown of German Kultur compels a sweeping > revision of the attitude of civilized nations and individuals toward the > German language, literature, and science. The close scrutiny of German > thought induced by 'Hun' frightfulness in this war has revealed abhorrent > qualities hitherto unknown, and to most people unsuspected. Hereafter, > throughout every English-speaking country on the globe, the German language > will be a dead language.

It was developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s by the Dutch educational counsellor Maria Aarts. She recognised the difficulties in explaining scientific observations of a child's problems to parents and other educators, as they are often unable to relate to the pedagogic jargon and identify the relevance of these insights in everyday-life situations. She developed a method where normal situations between child and educator were recorded by video and later watched by the parents or other educators to enable discussion together. By this, strengths and weaknesses of both children and educators in their interaction should be more easily recognised, which in turn aims at helping both to gain the optimism and power to solve educational issues themselves. Enhanced communication becomes the most important instrument in achieving this. After having practiced Marte Meo for many years, Maria Aarts founded the Marte Meo organisation in 1987, which aimed at teaching educational counsellors how to apply the Marte Meo method. Marte Meo has attracted significant attention not only in the Netherlands, but also in Scandinavia, France, Ireland and India where it is practiced. In these countries, it is often regarded as effective, cheap and pragmatic, which is opposite the viewpoint held by the therapeutic community in the United States, where the method is regarded as too time-consuming considering that there are other alternatives in such situationsAn Exploration of the Value of Marte Meo Therapy in Establish, Re-establishing and supporting Attachment Relationships Between Caregivers and their Children , By Geraldine Maughan, Department of Social Studies, 2008AXBERG, U., HANSSON, K., BROBERG, A.

Hearing the sermons of Dao An convinced Huiyuan to \\"leave the family\\" and embark on a life of Buddhist teachings.Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 97. Later, he became a patriarch of Donglin Temple (East Forest Temple) at Mount Lushan. His teachings were various, including the vinaya (ÊàíÂæã), meditation (Á¶™Ê≥ï), abhidharma and Prajna or wisdom. Although Huiyuan did not take the initiative in establishing the relations with the secular world, he had contacts with court and gentry families. Huiyuan was on two occasions invited by the dictator Huan Xuan to take part in the discussions about the status of the clergy and Huiyuan defended the independence of the clergy. Members of the cultured classes came to live on Mount Lu as Huiyuan's lay disciples to take part in the religious life.

He argued that Buddhists could make good subjects in a kingdom due to their beliefs in retribution of karma and the desire to be reborn in paradise.

The beginning of the Danian age (and the end of the preceding Maastrichtian age) is at the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event . The age ended , being followed by the Selandian age.International Commission on Stratigraphy 2017 Stratigraphic definitions Artist impression of what a Patagonian landscape might have looked like in the Danian. The Danian was introduced in scientific literature by German-Swiss geologist Pierre Jean √âdouard Desor in 1847 following a study of fossils found in France and Denmark.Danien, Den Store Danske Encyklop√¶di He identified this stage in deposits from Faxe and M√∏ns Klint and named it after the Latin name for Denmark. The Montian stage from Belgian stratigraphy (named after the city of Mons) is now known to be roughly equivalent to the Upper Danian and is considered a junior synonym and is no longer in use. The base of the Danian is defined at the iridium anomaly which characterized the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary (K‚ÄìT boundary) in stratigraphic sections worldwide. A section in El Kef, Tunisia was appointed as a reference profile (GSSP) for this important boundary.The GSSP for the Danian stage was established by Molina et al. (2006) The Danian is the oldest age of the Paleocene, defined at its base by the K-Pg boundary. It is very important because the readily recognized iridium anomaly and primitive Danian planktonic foraminifers define the base of the Danian. Danian foraminiferans repopulated the Paleocene seas after the Cretaceous mass extinction (Olsson et al., 1996). The first replacement foraminiferan of the Paleogene is the Globigerina eugubina, which is used to define the base of the Danian Age (Stainforth et al., 1975). This foraminiferan replaced the Cretaceous genus Globotruncana. The top of the Danian stage (the base of the Selandian) is close to the boundary between biozones NP4 and NP5 from marine biostratigraphy. It is slightly after the first appearances of many new species of the calcareous nanoplankton genus Fasciculithus (F. ulii, F. billii, F. janii, F. involutus, F. tympaniformis and F. pileatus) and close to the first appearance of calcareous nanoplankton species Neochiastozygus perfectus. The Danian stage overlaps the Puercan and Torrejonian North American land mammal ages and the Shanghuan and lowest part of the Nongshanian Asian land mammal ages. It includes the oldest Mammal Paleogene zones, all included in the 1 - 5 group. Paleontology Though the non-avian dinosaurs were gone, the mammals and other land animals remained small, most not even bigger than a sheep; however; a few (like Ankalagon saurognathus) reached the size of a medium-sized bear. Numerous lineages of modern birds also survived, particularly in the area around Australia but also elsewhere, e.g. Scaniornis of the North Sea region. The oceans remained much the same as the Late Cretaceous seas, only that there was less life, few remaining marine reptiles (mostly turtles, choristodera and crocodiles), and other lesser-known animals. There are controversial reports of ammonites (mainly of the Scaphitidae class in Turkmenistan) still being around at this time, although they didn't survive the stage.Squid Empire: The Rise and Fall of the Cephalopods by Danna Staaf References =Literature= *; 1847: Sur le terrain Danien, nouvel √©tage de la craie, Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© G√©ologique de France, s√©rie 2, 3, pp. 179‚Äì181, . *; 2004: A Geologic Time Scale 2004, Cambridge University Press. *; 2006: The Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point for the base of the Danian Stage (Paleocene, Paleogene, \\"Tertiary\\", Cenozoic) at El Kef, Tunisia: original definition and revision, Episodes 29(4), pp. 263‚Äì273, . *; 1996:The Cretaceous-Tertiary catastrophe event at Millers Ferry, Alabama in Ryder, G., Fastovsky, D., and Gartner, S., eds., The Cretaceous-Tertiary Event and other catastrophes in Earth history: Geological Society of America Special Paper 307, pp. 263‚Äì277. *; 1975: Cenozoic planktonic foraminifera zonation and characteristics of index forms: The University of Kansas Paleontological Institute, Article 62, 425 p.

It is coeval with the lower part of the Wangerripian stage from the Australian regional timescale. The start of the Selandian represents a sharp depositional change in the North Sea Basin, where there is a shift to siliciclastic deposition due to the uplift and erosion of the Scotland-Shetland area after nearly 40 million years of calcium carbonate deposition. This change occurs at the same time as the onset of a foreland basin formation in Spitsbergen due to compression between Greenland and Svalbard, suggesting a common tectonic cause that altered the relative motions of the Greenland Plate and the Eurasian Plate. This plate reorganisation event is also manifest as a change in seafloor spreading direction in the Labrador Sea around this time. Fauna and Flora The fauna of the Selandian consisted of giant snakes (Titanoboa), crocodiles, champsosaurs, GastornithiformesSee for example Owls; while the mammalian fauna was composed of a few archaic forms of mammals, such as Mesonychids, Pantodonts, primate relatives Plesiadapids, and Multiberculates.

Not much is known about her mother Judith Killigrew, but her father Dr. Henry Killigrew published several sermons and poems as well as a play called The Conspiracy. Her two paternal uncles were also published playwrights. Sir William Killigrew (1606‚Äì1695) published two collections of plays and Thomas Killigrew (1612‚Äì1683) not only wrote plays but built the theatre now known as Drury Lane. Her father and her uncles had close connections with the Stuart Court, serving Charles I, Charles II, and his Queen, Catherine of Braganza. Her father had been a chaplain to Charles I, and after the English Restoration was given positions such as Master of the Savoy Hospital. Anne was made a personal attendant as Maid of Honour to Mary of Modena, Duchess of York.Dictionary, 38 James II (1685) - Royal Collection Little is recorded about Anne's education, but it was appropriate for her social class and the literary tastes of the family, and she received instruction in both poetry and painting in which she excelled. Because of her father's work‚Äîhe was a clergyman and a playwright, and her uncle was the well- known playwright and theatrical patentee Thomas Killigrew‚Äîshe was encouraged to pursue her creative talents, unusual for women in the 17th century. Her theatrical background added to her use of shifting voices in her poetry. In John Dryden's \\"Ode To the Pious Memory of the accomplished young lady, Mrs. Anne Killigrew,\\" he points out that \\"Art she had none, yet wanted none, / For Nature did that want supply\\". Killigrew most likely got her education through studying the Bible, Greek mythology, and philosophy. Mythology was often expressed throughout her paintings and poetry. Inspiration for Killigrew's poetry came from her knowledge of Greek myths and Biblical proverbs as well as from some very influential female poets who lived during the Restoration period: Katherine Philips and Anne Finch (also a maid to Mary of Modena at the same time as Killigrew). Mary of Modena encouraged the French tradition of precieuses (patrician women intellectuals) which pressed women's participation in theatre, literature, and music. In effect, Killigrew was surrounded with a poetic feminist inspiration on a daily basis in Court: she was encompassed by strong intelligent women who encouraged her writing career as much as their own. With this motivation came a short book of only thirty-three poems published soon after her death by her father. It was not abnormal for poets, especially for women, never to see their work published in their lifetime. Since Killigrew died at the young age of 25 she was only able to produce a small collection of poetry. In fact, the last three poems were only found among her papers and it is still being debated about whether or not they were actually written by her. Inside the book is also a self painted portrait of Anne and the Ode by family friend and poet John Dryden.  The Poet and the Painter  Mezzotint of Anne Killigrew, based on a self portrait she had painted. Anne Killigrew excelled in multiple media, which was noted by contemporary poet, mentor, and family friend, John Dryden in his dedicatory ode to Killigrew. He addresses her as \\"the Accomplisht Young LADY Mrs Anne Killigrew, Excellent in the two Sister-Arts of Po√´sie, and Painting.\\" Scholars believe that Kelligrew painted a total of 15 paintings; however, only four are known to exist today. Many of her paintings display biblical and mythological imagery. Yet, Killigrew was also skilled at portraits, and her works include a self-portrait and a portrait of James, Duke of York. Some of her poetry references her own paintings, such as her poem \\"On a Picture Painted by her self, representing two Nimphs of DIANA's, one in a posture to Hunt, the other Batheing.\\" Both her poems and her paintings place emphasis on women and nature, suggesting female rebellion in a male-dominated society. Contemporary critics noted her exceptional skill in both mediums, with John Dryden addressing his dedicatory John Dryden and critical reception Killigrew is best known for being the subject of John Dryden's famous, extolling ode, which praises Killigrew for her beauty, virtue, and literary talent. However, Dryden was one of several contemporary admirers of Killigrew, and the posthumous collection of her work published in 1686 included several additional poems commending her literary merit, irreproachable piety, and personal charm. Nonetheless, critics often disagree about the nature of Dryden's ode: some believe his praise to be too excessive, and even ironic. These individuals condemn Killigrew for using well worn and conventional topics, such as death, love, and the human condition, in her poetry and pastoral dialogues. In fact, Alexander Pope, a prominent critic, as well as the leading poet of the time, labelled her work \\"crude\\" and \\"unsophisticated.\\" As a young poet who had only distributed her work via manuscript prior to her death, it is possible that Killigrew was not ready to see her work published so soon. Some say Dryden defended all poets because he believed them to be teachers of moral truths; thus, he felt Killigrew, as an inexperienced yet dedicated poet, deserved his praise. However, Anthony Wood in his 1721 essay defends Dryden's praise, confirming that Killigrew \\"was equal to, if not superior\\" to any of the compliments lavished upon her. Furthermore, Wood asserts that Killigrew must have been well received in her time, otherwise ‚Äúher Father would never have suffered them to pass the Press‚Äù after her death. Authorship controversy Then, there is the question of the last three poems that were found among her papers. They seem to be in her handwriting, which is why Killigrew's father added them to her book. The poems are about the despair the author has for another woman, and could possibly be autobiographical if they are in fact by Killigrew. Some of her other poems are about failed friendships, possibly with Anne Finch, so this assumption may have some validity.  An early death  Killigrew died of smallpox on 16 June 1685, when she was only 25 years old. She is buried in the Chancel of the Savoy Chapel (dedicated to St John the Baptist) where a monument was built in her honour, but has since been destroyed by a fire.

He is credited with victories as a squadron leader with the Flying Tigers and another six as an officer in the United States Army Air Corps in World War II. He retired as a brigadier general. Early life He was born in Gwangju, Korea under Japanese rule, the son of Presbyterian missionaries, but raised in Texas. \\"Tex\\" graduated from San Antonio Academy, San Antonio, Texas, in 1928 and from McCallie School in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in 1934. Tex then attended Texas A&M; for two years before transferring to Austin College, from which he graduated in 1938. He was also a founding member of the Phi Sigma Alpha fraternity in 1932. Military career Hill earned his wings as a United States Naval Aviator in 1939 and joined the fleet as a TBD Devastator torpedo bomber pilot aboard the USS Saratoga, before joining a Vought SB2U Vindicator dive bomber squadron aboard . In 1941, he was recruited with other Navy, Army and Marine Corps pilots to join the 1st American Volunteer Group (better known by its later nickname of the Flying Tigers). He learned to fly the P-40 in the AVG training program in Burma, and did well as a fighter pilot in the 2nd Pursuit Squadron (Panda Bear) as a flight leader and then squadron commander, becoming one of the top aces under the tutelage of Claire Chennault. Hill landed his first kills on January 3, 1942, when he downed two Nates over the Japanese airfield at Tak, Thailand. He shot down two more on January 23, and became an ace the next day when he shot down a fighter and a bomber over Rangoon. In March, he succeeded Jack Newkirk as squadron leader of the Second Squadron. By the time the AVG was disbanded in the summer of 1942, Hill was a double ace, credited with victories. On May 7, 1942, the Japanese Army began building a pontoon bridge across the Salween River, which would allow them to move troops and supplies into China. To stem this tide, squadron leader Hill led a flight of four new P-40Es bombing and strafing into the mile-deep gorge. During the next four days, the AVG pilots flew continuous missions into the gorge, effectively neutralizing the Japanese forces. From that day on, the Japanese never advanced further than the west bank of the Salween. Claire Chennault would later write of these critical missions, \\"The American Volunteer Group had staved off China's collapse on the Salween.\\" On Thanksgiving Day 1943, he led a force of 12 B-25s, 10 P-38s, and 8 new P-51s from Saichwan, China, on the first strike against Formosa. The Japanese had 100 bombers and 100 fighters at Shinchiku Airfield, and the bombers were landing as Hill's force arrived. The enemy managed to get seven fighters airborne, but they were promptly shot down. Forty-two Japanese airplanes were destroyed, and 12 more were probably destroyed in the attack. The American force returned home with no casualties. After the deactivation of the Flying Tigers in July 1942, Hill was one of only five Flying Tigers to join its United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) successor, the 23rd Fighter Group, with the rank of major. He activated the 75th Fighter Squadron and later commanded the 23rd Fighter Group as a colonel. Before returning to the states in late 1944, Hill and his P-51 downed another six Japanese aircraft. It is believed that he was the first to down a Zero with a P-51. Altogether, Hill was credited with destroying 18.25 enemy aircraft. The .25 kills comes from an assist; he and 3 other pilots worked together to shoot down a Japanese Nate fighter. In 1944, Hill returned to the U.S. and took command of the 412th Fighter Group, America's first operational jet fighter group flying the P-59 Airacomet and the P-80 Shooting Star. He separated from active service in the USAAF in 1945. Postwar, in July 1946, Hill was asked by Texas Governor Coke Stevenson to activate and accept command of the 136th Fighter Group of the Texas Air National Guard. Hill activated Guard units throughout the Gulf Coast and became the youngest brigadier general in the history of the Air National Guard. He once again saw combat, serving during the Korean War with the Texas Air National Guard. He ended his military career in the Air Force Reserve, retiring as a brigadier general. During his career he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, Distinguished Flying Cross with two Oak Leaf Clusters, Presidential Unit Citation with Oak Leaf Cluster, Chinese Order of the Cloud and Banner 4th, 5th and 6th grades, 2-Star Wing Decorations, Chinese Victory Medal, Legion of Merit, and British Distinguished Flying Cross. Later life In 1999, Hill was inducted into the Texas Aviation Hall of Fame located at the Lone Star Flight Museum in Houston, Texas. He was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 2006. In 2002, he was conveyed an honorary lifetime membership in the U.S. Air Force Auxiliary (Civil Air Patrol) with a squadron of the CAP named in his honor‚Äîthe Tex Hill Composite Squadron, of San Marcos, TX (SWR- TX-435). This squadron went on to become the third largest CAP squadron in the nation and in 2003 became the most decorated CAP squadron in the nation receiving the Texas Squadron of Merit, Texas Emergency Services Squadron of the Year, Regional (SW Region of the USA) Squadron of Distinction, and National Squadron of Distinction. Hill died at the age of ninety-two on October 11, 2007 in Terrell Hills, Texas, of congestive heart failure. More than 2,000 people attended his funeral. He was buried at nearby Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery. On November 2, 2007, the National Museum of the Pacific War in Fredericksburg observed \\"Tex\\" Hill Day with speeches, patriotic music, and friends' memories of the fallen hero. On November 2, 2008, the Air Force Heritage Flight at the Lackland AFB Air Show in San Antonio was dedicated to Hill. It consisted of an F-22, an F-15E, an F-16C, and a P-40 like the one Hill flew with the AVG. The NEISD Board of Trustees voted unanimously to name Middle School 14 after World War II fighter pilot and combat ace David Lee \\"Tex\\" Hill at its regular meeting Monday, June 17, 2013.

Events The Ypresian age begins during the throes of the Paleocene‚ÄìEocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). The Fur Formation in Denmark and the Messel shales in Germany are from this age. Stratigraphic definition The Ypresian stage was introduced in scientific literature by Belgian geologist Andr√© Hubert Dumont in 1850. The Ypresian is named after the Flemish city of Ypres in Belgium (spelled Ieper in Dutch). The definitions of the original stage were totally different from the modern ones.Steurbaut (2006) The Ypresian shares its name with the Belgian Ieper Group (French: Groupe d'Ypres), which has an Ypresian age.

It was designed by the renowned civil engineer Thomas Telford and built from 1812 to 1814. It is a Category A listed structure. Construction Illustration of the bridge from the 1838 Atlas to the Life of Thomas Telford. The bridge has a single span of approximately and was revolutionary for its time, in that it used an extremely slender arch which was not possible using traditional masonry construction. The ironwork was cast at the Plas Kynaston iron foundry at Cefn Mawr, near Ruabon in Denbighshire by William Hazledine, who cast a number of Telford bridges. The ironwork was transported from the foundry through the Ellesmere Canal and Pontcysyllte Aqueduct then by sea to Speymouth, where it was loaded onto wagons and taken to the site. Testing in the 1960s revealed that the cast-iron had an unusually high tensile strength. This was probably specified by Telford because, unlike in traditional masonry arch bridges, some sections of the arch are not in compression under loading. At each end of the structure there are two high masonry mock-medieval towers, featuring arrow slits and miniature crenellated battlements. History The bridge was in regular use until 1963, when it was closed for a major refurbishment. A plaque records the completion of this work in 1964. The side railings and spandrel members were replaced with new ironwork fabricated to match the originals. A 14 ton restriction was placed on the bridge at this point. This, along with the fact that the road to the north of the bridge takes a sharp right-angled turn to avoid a rock face, made it unsuitable for modern vehicles. Despite this, it carried foot and vehicle traffic across the River Spey until 1972, when its function was replaced by a reinforced concrete beam bridge built by Sir William Arrol & Co. which opened in 1970 and carries the A941 road today. Telford's bridge remains in good condition, and is still open to pedestrians and cyclists. The bridge has been given Category A listed status by Historic Scotland and has been designated a civil engineering landmark by the Institution of Civil Engineers and American Society of Civil Engineers. In 1994, it hosted a parade upon the amalgamation of The Gordon Highlanders and The Queen's Own Highlanders (Seaforth and Camerons) to form The Highlanders (Seaforth, Gordons and Camerons). A plaque has been fitted to the bridge parapet to commemorate this. Moray Council maintain the bridge, but it is not known who owns it. In November 2017 efforts were started to discover the owner. Usage in media The bridge inspired Scottish composer William Marshall to write the popular Strathspey dance in 1814. The bridge was commemorated on a Royal Mail postage stamp in 2015.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney- shetland-31727530 It also features in the artwork and logos of Spey Valley Brewery who brew an 1814 lager in commemoration of the bridge.

It spans the time between . It is preceded by the Priabonian stage (part of the Eocene) and is followed by the Chattian stage. Name The stage is named after the small river Rupel in Belgium, a tributary to the Scheldt. The Belgian Rupel Group derives its name from the same source. The name Rupelian was introduced in scientific literature by Belgian geologist Andr√© Hubert Dumont in 1850. The separation between the group and the stage was made in the second half of the 20th century, when stratigraphers saw the need to distinguish between lithostratigraphic and chronostratigraphic names. Stratigraphic definition The base of the Rupelian stage (which is also the base of the Oligocene series) is at the extinction of the foraminiferan genus Hantkenina. An official GSSP for the base of the Rupelian has been assigned in 1992 (Massignano, Italy). The transition with the Chattian has also been marked with a GSSP in August 2017 (Monte Conero, Italy). The top of the Rupelian stage (the base of the Chattian) is at the extinction of the foram genus Chiloguembelina (which is also the base of foram biozone P21b). The Rupelian overlaps the Orellan, Whitneyan and lower Arikareean North American Land Mammal Ages, the upper Mustersan and Tinguirirican South American Land Mammal Ages, the uppermost Headonian, Suevian and lower Arvernian European Land Mammal Mega Zones (the Rupelian spans the Mammal Paleogene zones 21 through 24 and part of 25), and the lower Hsandgolian Asian Land Mammal Age. It is also coeval with the only regionally used upper Aldingan and lower Janjukian stages of Australia, the upper Refugian and lower Zemorrian stages of California and the lower Kiscellian Paratethys stage of Central and eastern Europe. Other regionally used alternatives include the Stampian, Tongrian, Latdorfian and Vicksburgian.

At the 2006 census, its population was 55,651, in 15,556 families. It is one of the ancient desert cities of the province, close to Kashan (around 5 km). As suggested by its name, the city is an amalgam of two formerly separate settlements: Aran (Persian: ÿ¢ÿ±ÿßŸÜ, also Romanized as ƒÄrƒÅn and Ar≈´n) and Bidgol. History The area originally consisted of two distinct and separate villages named ‚ÄúAran‚Äù and ‚ÄúBidgol‚Äù. Each village had its own customs, social communications, and dialect. It was situated near the Silk Road and many caravans passed it on their way from Europe to the Orient. About 40 years ago, the wall of separation collapsed and these two small towns unified. We can name the Jandaghian family as one of the most famous ones in this city. Jandaghians have a representative in the Ministry of interiors. Geography and industry The town is surrounded by desert from the north and east, and thus it has a typical climate of hot and dry in summer, cold and dry in winter, and very little rainfall during the year. These conditions make agriculture difficult. Carpet making is the main industrial product of the town, and the carpets are exported to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and other neighboring countries. Recently, natural gas and oil resources have been discovered near the city.
