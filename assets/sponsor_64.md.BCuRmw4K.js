Short video clips began airing on American television beginning January 2011, expanding by October to a television, bus and billboard campaign in 12 US cities and Brisbane, Australia. The executive director of the campaign was Stephen B. Allen. In 2013 the campaign was extended to Ireland and the UK with ads on double-decker buses and the internet, said to be in response to the opening of the musical The Book of Mormon in London. In Melbourne during the 2017 run, the Church advertised at Southern Cross railway station and elsewhere in the city, as well as on television. The campaign emphasized facts about LDS Church membership through cultural and racial diversity of individuals profiled, representing (in 2011) more than a million claimed LDS members in Mexico and Brazil each, and nearly as many in Asia. The campaign has been subject of scholarly articles concerning its relationship with Mormonism and women. The campaign did not air in Iowa, South Carolina or Florida during the 2011 Republican presidential primary season to avoid causing controversy around LDS candidates Mitt Romney and Jon Huntsman. In October 2018, the President of the Church Russell M. Nelson said that the use of nicknames such as Mormon was \\"a major victory for Satan.\\" The outreach campaign thus ended. The mormon.org website along with all the member contributed profiles have both been deleted from the internet and now redirect to a new church website which avoids the Mormon moniker.

He became a chief inspector of mines, a member of the public railway network, and was responsible for the Paris quarries. Early years (1849‚Äì85) Charles Emile Wickersheimer was born on 22 February 1849 in the small village of Handschuheim near Strasbourg, Bas-Rhin. His parents were Charles Wickersheimer, a teacher, and Louise Hild. His brother, Charles-Ernest Wickersheimer (1851‚Äì1924), became an army doctor. His father was the village schoolmaster, but soon obtained a teaching post in the town of Strasbourg, where Charles Emile attended the lyc√©e. He joined the √âcole Polytechnique in the promotion of 1868. He was described in the school's register as \\"Light brown hair, no beard, strong nose, blue eyes, small mouth, dimpled chin, oval face\\". He graduated in 1870 to enter the √âcole des Mines de Paris, but left to volunteer in the army during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. After the war Wickersheimer entered the √âcole des Mines on 19 June 1871, and graduated as an ordinary mining engineer on 30 May 1874. He joined the Corps des mines, and was appointed to the ordinary service of the mines of the Aude and the Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales. He was named engineer of the mines of Carcassonne, Aude. He married Marie Charry of Pamiers during his 8-year time as engineer of the Carcassonne mines. While at Carcasonne he was involved in the project for a maritime canal in Le Midi, which he popularized in public speeches. Wickersheimer was promoted to 1st class mining engineer in 1883. He was appointed engineer for mines and steam engines for the Seine department, and was put in charge of the Chemins de fer de Paris √† Lyon et √† la M√©diterran√©e. In 1883 he filed a patent for the perforation of mining galleries and in 1886 filed a patent for the locks of large navigation canals. He became politically radical, and was appointed municipal councilor and administrator of the hospices. Deputy (1885‚Äì93) Wickersheimer ran in the elections of 4 and 18 October 1885 on the radical list for the department of Aude, and was elected on the second round. He sat on the far left. He was opposed to the 1883 agreements with the railway companies. He campaigned vigorously for nationalization of the railway network. He fought the proposed surtax on cereals, voted for the expulsion of the princes, against indefinited postponment of constitutional revision, for prosecution of three deputies of the far-right Ligue des Patriotes, against the proposed Lisbonne law defining and restricting the freedom of the press, for the prosecution of General Georges Ernest Boulanger. On 28 November 1886 Wickersheimer attacked the 1810 mining law, saying \\"The State has no right to commit future generations; to say that mining property is property like any other is an obvious mistake.\\" Wickersheimer ran for reelection in 1889 for the 2nd district of Carcassonne, but was defeated by Th√©ron. On 20 April 1893 he ran in the by-election caused by the death of Lasbeysses, deputy for the Pamiers constituency of the Ari√®ge department, and decisively defeated Julien Dumas in the second round. In the general elections of 10 August 1893 he was narrowly defeated by Julien Dumas, and retired from politics. Later career (1893‚Äì1915) Wickersheimer was appointed chief engineer in 1890. In 1896 he was appointed a member of the Council of the Public Railway Network, where he remained until 1909. From 1896 to 1907 he was inspector general of the Paris quarries, the last inspector- general to be a Freemason. He was made an office of the Legion of Honour. During World War I (1914‚Äì18) he was appointed lieutenant colonel in the artillery, responsible for inspection of ammunition manufacture. Charles Emile Wickersheimer died at the age of 66 on 18 November 1915 in Le V√©sinet, Yvelines. Publications Wickersheimer was a member of the Soci√©t√© de g√©ographie de Toulouse, and published articles on science and mining legislation in the society's bulletin. His studies included Etude du barom√®tre (1876), L√©gislation des mines (1877), Notice sur la mine de Cardacet (1877), Voyage en Alsace-Lorraine (1884), Terrain glaciaire des Pyr√©n√©es Orientales (1885), Mines de pyrites dans la commune de Rouairoux (Tarn) (1886) and l'Alliance franco-russe (1892).

It is the first organization in the Innocence Network to be established in the Deep South. Based in the Bywater neighborhood of New Orleans, it is staffed by students, volunteers, and attorneys.  Work  Innocence Project New Orleans states that its mission is to \\"free innocent prisoners, expose injustice and prevent future wrongful convictions.\\" Its chapter devotes resources to freeing citizens whose socioeconomic background have placed them on the wrong side of the justice system. It is the second largest free-standing project of the Innocence Network in the country.  Funding  Chief sources of funding for the Innocence Project New Orleans include the National Institute of Justice, the Bureau of Justice Assistance, and The Louisiana Public Defender Board. IPNO also holds a fundraiser gala annually in May and accept individual donations.  Founding  In 1999, Emily Bolton was awarded an Equal Justice Fellowship and later a Soros Advocacy Fellowship to establish Innocence Project New Orleans. The two year fellowship was worth $72,000 and IPNO was officially recognized by the National Association of Public Interest Law (now Equal Justice Works) in 2001. = Emily Bolton = Born in England, Bolton graduated from Tulane University School Of Law and began studying wrongful convictions in the Greater New Orleans area. Under her leadership, IPNO grew from a staff of one to nine and had freed 27 innocent prisoners in a span of 4 years.  Common causes of wrongful convictions  * Mistaken eyewitness identification * Lying / incentivized witness testimony * False confessions / admissions * Faulty or unreliable forensic techniques * \\"Bad lawyering\\"  How cases are chosen  Innocence Project New Orleans currently has 20 cases in active litigation and approximately 30 in Stage 2 investigation. * The person claims they are factually innocent of the crime for which they are in prison. * The individual was convicted in Louisiana or south Mississippi. * The individual is serving a life sentence. * The individual's direct appeal has been denied. * The individual can not afford an attorney. * The individual is not serving a sentence on another, unrelated charge that will mean he or she will not be released if the conviction at issue is overturned.  House Bill 305  In 2011, Louisiana passed a house bill that provides the reduction of a defendant‚Äôs sentence for substantial assistance in an investigation. IPNO was opposed to the bill but negotiated with lawmakers to help ensure when a snitch witness testify, they are protected by the court and the content of their deal and the substance of their testimony is disclosed to the defense.  Notable Cases  = Glenn Ford = Glenn Ford is Louisiana's longest-serving death row prisoner and one of the longest-serving death row prisoners in the United States. On November 5, 1983, Ford was charged with the murder of Isadore Rozeman, an elderly white man. Ford had done yard work for Rozeman, and after the murder, he gave police information about two potential male suspects. The girlfriend of one of those suspects later implicated Mr. Ford in the murder and he was indicted for first-degree murder along with the other two men. Mr. Ford was tried and sentenced to death by an all-white jury. The charges against the other two men were dropped. The court selected public defenders for Ford from an alphabetical list from the Louisiana Bar Association. Lead counsel was an corporate attorney who had never tried a case to a jury; co- counsel had been out of law school less than two years and was working at an insurance defense firm on slip-and-fall cases and had no experience in criminal law. New lawyers presented evidence that the State concealed that confirmed Ford's testimony in 1983. He was not present at or involved in the murder. The concealed file included information from an informant, a suppressed police report related to the time of the crime, and evidence of the murder weapon, which implicated the true perpetrator ‚Äì one of the other two men originally charged with Ford. In 2012, Mr. Ford filed a petition in federal court. In 2013, prosecutors told defense counsel that a confidential informant stated that one of the other men charged in the crime had admitted to him that he - not Mr. Ford - shot and killed Rozeman. Last week, both the State and Mr. Ford's lawyers filed motions to vacate his conviction and sentence. The prosecutors wrote in their motion: \\"[I]f the information had been within the knowledge of the State, Glenn Ford might not even have been arrested or indicted for this offense,‚Äù though they did not identify the information. Ford was released in March 2015. = Travis Hayes = 17 year old Hayes was under the influence of marijuana at the time of his interrogation for the murder of grocery-store owner Tommy Vanhoose. He was questioned through the night by at least three different police officers without an attorney or even a parent present. After eight hours of interrogation through which he and his co-assailant Ryan Matthews gave consistent accounts of their whereabouts that day, Hayes finally agreed to his interrogators' version of events. He placed himself at the scene of the crime, though could not give the police any details about the crime whatsoever. DNA testing later linked another, unrelated, man to the killing and both Travis and Matthews, were exonerated.

The siege first commenced in October 1593, but winter and shortages of food and supplies forced the Spanish into winter quarters.van Nimwegen p 161Motley p 269 The siege however recommenced in March 1594, but on May 6 Maurice of Orange arrived with an Anglo-Dutch army to relieve Coevorden, forcing the Spanish army under Francisco Verdugo to retreat.Knight, Charles Raleigh: Historical records of The Buffs, East Kent Regiment (3rd Foot) formerly designated the Holland Regiment and Prince George of Denmark's Regiment. Vol I. London, Gale & Polden, 1905, p. 37-38 Background The Spanish Army of Flanders had been hampered in its effort to overcome Dutch resistance. When the Spanish forces were committed in France to halt the collapse of the Catholic League; Dutch and English forces under the command of Maurice of Nassau and Francis Vere respectively went on the offensive. Maurice adopted the same tactics as the Duke of Parma, by creating defensible barriers and zones of control. This resulted in many towns and regions falling into Anglo-Dutch hands throughout the 1590s.Morris p 294 The city of Coevorden was one of these towns and had been captured in September 1592 which thus cut off the Spaniards eastern supply line to Groningen. The following year the capture of Geertruidenberg cut off Groningen further. The Spanish Stadtholder in the region Francisco Verdugo noted that Coevorden was crucial to Spanish rule in the northern Netherlands. It was also important for the Spanish stranglehold in Drenthe therefore he was committed to retaking it. Beginning in 1593, Verdugo launched his campaign and struck from Groenlo and occupied the small town of Gramsbergen, building small forts and establishing positions in Emlichheim and Dalen. Verdugo constructed a road through Drenthe into Bentheim and Schoonebeek.The construction of the road however was prevented further by William Louis, Count of Nassau at which point the road was destroyed and blocked off. At the same time in Coevorden the garrison there led by governor Caspar van Eussum made precautions and stocked up; ammunition and food were quickly despatched and brought into Coevorden for the anticipation of a Spanish siege. Campaign =1st Siege= Verdugo's forces marched to Coevorden via the Bruges Essche road in October 1593. The Spaniards thereon laid a dike via Klooster to De Haar establishing a tight blockade. Verdugo however was not familiar with the climate of Coevorden, and as well as a lack of fuel and food, disease took hold of the Spanish camp - many soldiers of which succumbed to. In addition, a great many deserted; one company shrank from 500 to 100 men. Soldiers who were looking for fuel and food then brought disease to the surrounding villages where whole families were infected and died. The garrison however was well supplied and the defences were strong - the blockade took no effect but cost Verdugo's force dearly. Verdugo realised by November that he had neither the munitions nor provisions for a long siege. Winter was coming and Verdugo had no choice but to retire from the fortress, the States forces were aware of this, but thought it was unnecessary to interfere with the Spanish retirement. They too went into winter quarters. =2nd Siege= Although the Spanish went into winter quarters, a tight blockade was put on Coevorden. Despite this, supplies still managed to get through, as well as reinforcements. In March 1594 Verdugo appeared before Coevorden with 8,000 troops, including 2,000 cavalry. Having surrounded the city, they demanded the surrender, but this was rejected by Van Eussum. He hoped for relief soon, but at the same time the Spanish dug siege positions and installed bastions around the key positions. =Relief= On hearing of the news of Verdugo's siege, Maurice with his force (which included twelve companies of English and ten Scots totalling 5,000 troops under Francis Vere) quickly moved from Zwolle and marched his force to Coevorden. Count William Louis, with his thirteen companies of Frisians, had fortified the area known as the Bourtange Marsh so that Maurice could move in quickly and take Verdugo at a disadvantage. William Louis soon joined Maurice and Vere on the road between Vecht and the Bourtange marsh totalling 9,600 soldiers and 1,900 cavalry. Count Philip of Hohenlohe-Neuenstein was sent with twenty Dutch companies to cover the southern borders against Verdugo's army of reinforcements under Frederik and Herman van den Bergh of which neared 8,000 men. Meanwhile, Maurice's forces soon approached Coevorden and started to dig trenches in front of the Spanish force surrounding the city. Verudgo reconnoitred the position but found the Anglo-Dutch to be impregnable and established on his line of communications. He then called a council of war and decided that to remain would result in destruction and that to attack was suicidal. On the night of May 7, the Spanish broke camp, burning everything they didn't need and retreated from the siege works. The siege of Coevorden had ended after thirty one weeks. Aftermath Verdugo split his force up to confuse the Anglo-Dutch if they pursued; most of his force went to Groningen while the rest headed towards Oldenzaal over the Ems river to Spanish occupied Lingen. After the relief of the city there were then two possibilities for Maurice; the immediate siege of Groningen or to drive the Spanish from the region of Twente. The Dutch rallied behind the latter plan, but William Louis and Vere thought that strategic sense was clear in the first plan. Despite heated debates, William Louis and Vere were overruled and Groningen was eventually chosen which would lead to its capture that year. Coevorden would remain in Dutch hands for the rest of the war. =Legacy= The dike that the Spaniards constructed during the siege is still present, and is now called the Spanjaardsdijk.

History Peterson was a known pirate by 1686 when he was sighted near Newport, where he put in to resupply his ship. He reappeared at Newport in 1688 in a 10-gun 70-man Spanish barca longa. Part of his crew consisted of the remnants of the crews of Jean Hamlin and two recently deceased pirates, Jan \\"Yankey\\" Willems and Jacob Evertson. Peterson was seized by local authorities and put on trial for piracy. His friends and neighbors made up enough of the grand jury that they refused to indict him or the traders who had helped him. He sold off prize ships he‚Äôd captured in the Caribbean as well as loot he had plundered, including hides and elephant tusks. Some of his men were detained in Boston, and two ships which had traded with Peterson were impounded, one of which had helped guide a prize ship of Peterson's into Martha's Vineyard. Avoiding the warship HMS Rose which had been sent to chase him, Peterson headed north toward Newfoundland where he burned the prize ship and took its crew aboard. He took several ships in the vicinity and held the Governor aboard his ship for a time after capturing and sacking the fort at Chebucto. At the Governor's request they left the fort's defenders enough arms and cannon to repulse Indian attacks. Peterson then captured a French ship, releasing it with a message that \\"French rogues had no business with other people's vessels,\\" and tried to free an English vessel which had been captured by the French. Fleeing HMS Rose once again, he released sailors he had taken from fishing vessels onto a captured ship. At last report he had collected a hundred men and a year's worth of supplies and prepared to sail to the Gold Coast.

They attach a phosphate group to specific proteins, called phosphorylation. These reactions can cause the function of the phosphorylated proteins to change. Both PEPR 1 and PEPR 2 can be classified as receptor kinases, which serve an important role in immunity in plants. Receptor kinases have the ability to change the conformation of receptors by adding the phosphate group. These specific receptor kinases serve as a pattern recognition receptor, or PRR, that can quickly and efficiently recognize many different molecular patterns or signatures that are unique to each pathogen. They can also detect different danger signals released from the host and respond accordingly. More specifically, the proteins contain leucine-rich repeat segments that interact outside of the cell. This leucine-rich repeat is a structural motif present in some proteins that has specific functions due to its folded structure. This fold can contain many repeating amino acids, but the most common is the hydrophobic leucine, hence the name. PEPR1 and PEPR2 are present in plants and are involved in several immune system processes. Their ability to change the conformation of receptors can have an effect on signaling processes within plants, allowing the plant to have a system of immunity in place in case of an infection or pathogen.  Discovery  The PEPR1 and PEPR2 kinases that bind to the receptors AtPEPR1 and AtPEPR2, respectively were identified. Through photolabeling with a radioactively marked ligand, an AtPep1 receptor was able to be purified and later duplicated. This led to the discovery of the first damage associated molecular pattern or DAMP/pattern recognition receptor couple in Arabidopsis, otherwise known as the thale cress, which is a small flowering plant common in Eurasia. This discovered receptor was coined PEPR1, PEP receptor 1. Further analysis of the Arabidopsis genome established a very genetically similar homologue of PEPR1, PEPR2, or PEP receptor 2.  Research  PEPR 1 and PEPR2 have been studied by multiple researchers for their properties and functions in immune system processes. Many of these studies involve isolating and crystallizing the proteins and have been performed in the natural setting, in vivo, as well as in an artificial lab environment, in vitro. The proteins function as inhibitors that potentially help plants have immunity to different substances by working with other compounds in the plant. Pep1, a receptor in the plant, can be controlled by PEPR1 and PEPR2, along with other proteins and enzymes such as ‚Äúbotrytis-induced kinase 1 (BIK1) and PBS1-like 1 (PBL1)‚Äù. More specifically, when exposed to the Pep1 receptor, the proteins act as kinases when interacting with BIK1.  Function  The receptor kinase properties of PEPR1 and PEPR2 allow them to perform important duties within plants. Plants have complex and detailed signaling systems, and receptor kinases ensure that these systems function properly. The receptor kinases recognize elements associated with pathogens that interact with the plant to ensure that the plant can protect itself from foreign, harmful substances. Using these properties, receptor kinases are very important in the immune system of a plant. PEPR 1 and PEPR 2 are homologs, meaning they have similar properties and structures, yet they have distinguishing reactions when exposed to different compounds. For example, both kinases act as receptors of AtPeps. However, they respond to the compound differently. The kinases each preferentially interact with a different AtPep, giving them unique functions depending on their environments. According to research done on PEPR1 and PEPR2, their function is very important not only in immunity, but in important signaling pathways as well, such as the jasmonic acid-ethylene pathway and the salicylic acid pathways. These unique responses may make it possible for PEPR 1 and PEPR 2 to be a link between both \\"local and systemic immunity\\" systems.  Structure  PEPR1 and PEPR2 share a unique structural component because they contain extracellular leucine-rich repeat motifs (LRR motifs). Studies have been conducted to discover the structure of PEPR1 or PEPR2, sometimes in complex with certain proteins and in specific environments. When complexed with AtPep1, it forms a crystalline structure in which the units contain two copies of PEPR1 and AtPep1 and are not symmetrical. In this complex, PEPR1 does not oligomerize as some other protein receptors would. The receptor kinase also contains a leucine rich repeat section that consists of 27 repeats.  Mutations  PEPR1 and PEPR2 have been shown to contain certain mutations that causes a change in or loss of function for the proteins. These mutations can create complications for the plant and its immune system when they occur. If PEPR1 and PEPR2 lose their sensitivity to proteins induced by damage to the plant, the plant cannot respond to heal itself. = Sensitivity to AtPep1 = Two mutants are currently associated with the Arabidopsis plant in relation to the PEPR1 and PEPR2 receptor kinases. These mutants have a mutation in their pepr1 and pepr2 genes which is affected in PEPR1 and its homologue PEPR2, respectively. These PEPR1 and PEPR2 receptor kinases are transcribed and further translated from the same chromosome. In order to create double mutant pepr1 and pepr2 offspring the two populations were crossed and screened for the AtPep1 insensitivity offspring. Both of those mutants and the wild type plants were found to have a sensitivity to AtPep1, a damage associated molecular pattern peptide. However, when both mutations occur a double mutant pepr1/pepr2 plant is completely insensitive to the AtPep1. These plants further fail to recognize AtPep2 and AtPep3, distinct homologues of AtPep1, which led Elzbieta Krol to the conclusion that the homologues PEPR1 and PEPR2 control their perception as well. = Sensitivity to ethylene = The same double mutation causes a decreased reaction to ethylene. In the plant, ethylene is a hormone produced when the plant is damaged. Ethylene also helps increase the response to damage caused to the plant. When PEPR1 and PEPR 2 bind to ethylene, they start the reaction to activate the immune system in the plant. However, when this mutation is present, the plant cannot properly respond to ethylene signals, decreasing its ability to heal itself.

Molecular analysis shows that Leifiporia belongs to the \\"core polyporoid clade\\", a grouping of fungi roughly equivalent to the family Polyporaceae. The generic name honours Norwegian mycologist and polypore specialist Leif Ryvarden. The genus is phylogenetically close to the fungi Diplomitoporus overholtsii and Lopharia cinerascens. It also groups near Pycnoporus and Trametes. A new combination, Leifiporia eucalypti, was proposed by the authors. This fungus, originally described as Dichomitus eucalypti by Ryvarden in 1985, is found in Australia. Description Leifiporia species are characterized by crust-like fruit bodies with an annual growth habit. Their pore surface is white to cream. Leifiporia has a dimitic hyphal system, containing both generative and skeletal hyphae. The generative hyphae have clamp connections and branch mostly at right angles. The skeletal hyphae are present in the subiculum only and distinctly thinner than the generative hyphae. The spores are ellipsoid, hyaline, thin-walled, and smooth. They usually contain one or two oil droplets. Habitat and distribution The type species L. rhizomorpha has been collected from Anhui and Zhejiang provinces in eastern China. In both cases, the fungus was growing on a fallen angiosperm branch. Leifiporia eucalypti is found in the Northern Territory of Australia, where it grows on Eucalyptus camaldulensis.

She was born in Coventry, England in 1925 to a working-class family. She served as postal clerk in the women's section of the British Army during WW2. After marrying she lived in a cottage on the east coast of Scotland for a decade, before migrating to Whayalla, South Australia, in 1957 with her husband Bill. She became active in the Anti- War Movement during the Vietnam War, prompted by concern about her son being conscripted.  Activism  Frazer was active in the Women's Liberation Movement. She was also part of the key group that established the Women's Liberation Centre at Bloor Court, Adelaide; including a counselling service attached to the centre. As part of her work and activism, Frazer helped establish the first Women's Shelter in Adelaide and the Christies Beach Shelter in Adelaide. She was an active member of the Tuesday Afternoon Group, a collective of women interested in women's issues.  Poetry  Frazer's early poetry consisted of short, humorous verses for her son. Shortly after her arrival in Australia in the 1950s, secret British nuclear tests were being conducted at Maralinga on a site measuring about 3,300 km¬≤ in area. Out of concern about the atomic bomb tests being conducted in her home state, Frazer began to express her response in verse. Finding that she could produce serious poetry on the topic of nuclear war, she used writing as an outlet and release. The political poems she wrote at this time were different in content and tone to her prior poetry, which was born out of the time she spent at home as a housewife and focused on domestic themes. During her school years Frazer had been put off poetry due to the emphasis on rote-learning rather than appreciation. Frazer was strongly affiliated with the Adelaide-based Friendly Street Poets, a poetry reading group and publisher based in Adelaide, South Australia. Australia's longest running open-mic poetry reading community, Friendly Street Poets was inaugurated as a fortnightly poetry reading on 11 November 1975, organised by Andrew Taylor, Richard Tipping and Ian Reid. Frazer has been published in 23 of the 26 readers of the Friendly Street Poet anthologies up until 2001, as well as in journals, newspapers, and magazines. Frazer has read on the ABC and radio 5UV, as well as broadcasting poems on 'Women Poets in Adelaide' in 1978. She participated in a poetry performance at the Unley Town Hall in 1987, organised by Tantrum Press and called The Company of Women. Two of her poems, 'Mirrors, and 'Death of a goddess' were performed at the Flinders University Drama Centre in 1996 in a piece called Mirrors: a performance anthology of SA women's poetry. Frazer was a founding sponsor of and contributor to the Green Left Weekly alternative newspaper and she was an active member of the Democratic Socialist Party. She has published two poetry collections with Friendly Street Poets: Other Ways of Looking (1988) and Earthdweller. She has edited Friendly Street Poetry reader no. 13 with Barry Westburg (1989). There is also a spoken text published about Connie's life, entitled Ugly as a Boxer's Glove, which is spoken by Connie and edited by Marg McHugh.

Education She was a graduate of the London School of Economics (LSE), social science certificate, Diploma in Sociology, Bachelor of Science and a mental health certificate. In addition, she had won a number of awards, including the LSE Loch Exhibition, Commonwealth Fund Child Scholarship and the Metcalfe Scholarship for women. Career Her initial career started with her working in the slums of London and Leeds. =Australia= She arrived in 1934, having been recruited to initiate a formal program of education for social work professionals in Melbourne. After arriving in Australia, she initially spoke to the Melbourne newspapers about the welfare conditions of society. She was interviewed by the Argus, in which she discussed American and English methods to addressing social welfare. At the time, she was advocating for Australia to follow US methods, unusual as Australia at the time usually followed English methods. Working at the University of Melbourne, she established a course in social work that was acceptable for the standards of the university. In 1940, the university agreed the course would run. This was the first social work course run in Melbourne, and there was a similar course run in Sydney in the same year. The establishment of the course opened up career paths for university educated women. While there were some women studying at university, most of the careers were dominated by men. Most of the students studying the Social Welfare course were women, unusual for women to be the majority of any university course at the time. Hyslop had advanced the role of the social worker, which she perceived to help people to find their own path in life. Hylsop was highly critical of 19th century charity workers who she saw had interfered in people's lives, saying they simply dispensed \\"soup, flannel and groceries \\" She was generally an advocate for social justice, defending the rights of the unemployed. =Rhodesia= After her work improving social work in Australia, she left academia, moving to Rhodesia where she joined an Anglican order of nuns.

The film is written by Jared Rivet. Plot Jackals is set in the 1980s and stars Stephen Dorff as a cult deprogrammer, Jimmy Levine, who has been hired by a family to retrieve their estranged teenage son, Justin Powell, from a murderous cult. Levine, along with the boy's father, Andrew Powell, forcibly remove Justin from the cult's clutches during what was staged to look like a kidnapping. The family, consisting of father, Andrew, mother, Kathy, older brother, Campbell, and Justin's former girlfriend, Samantha, along with her and Justin's baby, Zoey, had gathered for an intervention at Andrew‚Äôs cabin in the woods. Levine, who has either been in a cult himself or had a family member in a cult, attempts to reach Justin by various confrontational methods with no apparent success as Justin continues to appear brainwashed and insists that his real \\"family\\" is coming and will kill them all. With Justin unmoved by pleas made by his mother and Samantha, frustrations mount as Justin's brother and father clash over the effectiveness of Jimmy's methods and prior family issues resurface, such as why the parents had really separated. While still attempting to deprogram Justin, the family find themselves surrounded by Justin‚Äôs cult who silently appear to demand that their captive member be returned to them. First, ‚ÄúFox Girl‚Äù appears near the cabin and can be seen carving the cult‚Äôs symbol into a rock, which prompts Jimmy to confront her. After asking her repeatedly to leave, Jimmy walks into a trap which ties his hands, causing him to drop his gun, and soon after, his stomach slashed while his body is mutilated. A short time later as the family struggles to understand what is happening, more cultists silently appear. Several attempts to kill the family and retrieve Justin follow, with Justin's brother and father defending the family and alternatively arguing as the cultist's attacks increase. They manage to kill or incapacitate those cultists who invade the cabin, while Kathy manages to burn one with scalding oil and Samantha wounds another's hands while he was trying to push through the door. Justin, bound, remains unfazed at his family's struggles and continues to taunt them, indicating that the cultists will not stop until he is set free to return to them. Jimmy is used as bait and a distraction by the cultists‚Äîhe is rescued by the Powells but dies shortly afterwards from his injuries. During a botched attempt to get help, Justin's brother Campbell is captured. He is tied onto a swing set on the cabin grounds and his hands are set afire, one after the other, by the Lead Cultist. His mother Kathy, horrified, struggles not to go help Campbell, but then in her grief rushes out to meet the cultists, who easily capture her. Samantha, who had tried to stop Kathy, then focused on trying to convince Justin to communicate with the cultists and stop their threatening the family. Andrew rushes out with a pickaxe in an attempt to fight off the cultists and rescue his wife and son when he is outnumbered, outflanked, and stabbed several times until he collapses. Kathy is horrified, then her throat is slit by Fox Girl. Both parents die looking across from one another on the ground in the dirt at the feet of the cultists, and Campbell seems to succumb to his injuries while still tied to the swing set. Justin seems at last to show some recovery and asks that Samantha trust him and release him; she does with some trepidation. Justin suggests a desperate escape to Samantha while he meets the cultists. Samantha takes her baby and attempts to escape via a back door to the cabin and makes it to a road in the middle of the night. Justin appears to supplicate himself before the Lead Cultist, kneeling and pressing his head to the Leader's hand. Just as help via a vehicle seems possible, the headlights of the vehicle reveal that a cultist is behind Samantha, possibly Justin.

Picture was taken by the Mars Express orbiter of the European Space Agency Rupes Tenuis () is a Martian north polar scarp. It is named after one of the classical albedo features on Mars. Its name was officially approved by IAU in 1988. It extends from latitude 74.94¬∞N to 82.2¬∞N and from longitude 242.12¬∞E to 300.77¬∞E (59.23¬∞W ‚Äì 117.88¬∞W). Its centre is located at latitude 81.6¬∞N longitude 85.47¬∞W. It marks the outer perimeter of Planum Boreum from longitude 242.12¬∞E to 300.77¬∞E, and it is formed by the eastern extension of the Olympia Cavi, a series of local troughs and depressions, which become longer and deeper as they merge to create the Rupes Tenuis scarp formation. The scarp is located to the west of Chasma Boreale, at the base of Planum Boreum, and its height varies from a few hundred metres to a maximum of approximately 1000 metres. Local topography USGS map showing the location of Rupes Tenuis in Planum Boreum Immediately to the south of Rupes Tenuis, approximately at 285¬∫E, lies Abalos Mensa, a convex formation of approximately 180 kilometer span, shaped like a wedge when viewed from above. The dune field of Abalos Undae continues in a southwestward direction after it emerges from the western end of a narrow channel separating Rupes Tenuis from Abalos Mensa. Two named craters are located in the immediate area of Rupes Tenuis; Crotone, located at 82.2¬∫N, 290.0¬∫E with a 6.4 km diameter, is situated at the channel separating the scarp from Abalos Mensa, and Boola, located at 81.1¬∫N, 254.2¬∫E, with a 17 km diameter, is found close to the western boundary of the Rupes Tenuis scarp. West of Abalos Mensa, parallel to and south of the Rupes Tenuis scarp, runs a narrow, low-altitude plain, named Tenuis Mensa, which exhibits a southward slope. Erosion characteristics Upper Rupes Tenuis unit exposed northwest of Crotone crater The proposed erosion mechanism for the polar basal unit in general, and Rupes Tenuis in particular, are katabatic winds (From Greek: katabasis, \\"descent\\", i.e. strong winds descending from Planum Boreum), and solar ablation. These mechanisms are also considered responsible for the modern-day erosion and retreat of the Rupes Tenuis scarp, the existence of conical mounds and promontories in the immediate vicinity of the scarp, and the creation of the narrow channels that separate Abalos Mensa from the scarp. This erosion process is theorised to have existed since the Late Amazonian period on Mars, and it is considered to have contributed to the continuous retreat of the polar scarp from an older southern latitude as low as 74¬∫N. It is further theorised that the Rupes Tenuis stratigraphic unit may have been a paleo- plateau that descended further South than the present-day Rupes Tenuis scarp. Geological formations in the vicinity of the scarp, such as mounds, are considered to have been formed by erosion mechanisms rather than volcanic activity. The horizontal attitude (inclination) of the layers of the Rupes Tenuis unit, further indicates the non-volcanic origin of these formations, since layers of volcanic origin are not typically horizontal. Nearby formations such as Abalos Colles ‚Äî a group of five, flat or concave top, mounds, less than 700 m high and less than 1 km in diameter ‚Äî are considered to be erosional remnants of a once-continuous stratigraphic unit, the Rupes Tenuis unit.

Her research into medieval England covered: the survival strategies of single mothers; the experience of children in blended families; domestic violence; social mobility; widows and land ownership; and the phenomenon of ‚Äòserial monogamy'. Her work on the history of medieval society was founded on the painstaking examination of everyday records such as wills and court documents, which helped bring to life the often submerged history of marginalised and vulnerable social groups. Maddern worked extensively in the local records offices in England, particularly in East Anglia. She also wrote about the exhumation of the skeleton of the medieval king Richard III. She was also a writer of science fiction, and was nominated multiple times for the Ditmar Awards, winning a Special Committee award in 1977 for her work 'The Ins and Outs of the Hadhya City State'. The acclaimed science fiction writer Ursula Le Guin said of Maddern: \\"It grieves me very much to know Philippa is dead, yet it gives me joy to remember her in life. Teaching workshops you meet a few people like her, you smile when you think about them, you always are grateful to them for being who they were, for writing what they wrote, for believing that you could teach them anything.\\" Maddern was well known for her musical expertise: she was a recorder player in the early music group Tre Fontane, which also featured Kate Burridge, now Professor of Linguistics at Monash, and the singer/musicologist Helen Dell, a Melbourne Research Fellow. Maddern was married to Edward (Ted) Mundie who died in 2005.

Early life and education Rubbo was born in Melbourne to artist Ellen Rubbo and professor of microbiology Sydney Dattilo Rubbo. She had three siblings, academic architect Anna Rubbo, bookseller Mark Rubbo (b1948) and artist and filmmaker Michael Rubbo (b1938). Rubbo's family had strong connections to the arts. Her mother was a painter, and regularly exhibited in the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the Victorian state galleries. Her father also had an interest in the arts, especially painting, sculpture and the theatre. Her Italian-born grandfather Antonio Dattilo Rubbo was an artist and well-known art teacher. He taught at the (Royal) Art Society of New South Wales where he was also a council-member. While a teenager, Rubbo studied drama in New York. Rubbo graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Melbourne in 1965. Career In 1971, Rubbo was appointed as Director of the Student Union's Rowden White Library. Shortly thereafter she became the inaugural Director of the Ewing and George Paton Galleries at the University of Melbourne. She filled the role of Gallery Director until 1979 when she took a career break. The George Paton Gallery was the first funded art space dedicated to contemporary art in Australia. Under Rubbo's leadership, the gallery hosted and supported an array of leading experimental, activist and community-based exhibitions and events. Highlights include: In 1972, the inaugural Bubbles event at the gallery hosted three-thousand children for school holiday creative workshops. Frances Lindsay describes the initiative as \\"a pioneer program in Australian galleries and museums for the active and educative engagement of young people\\". With Meredith Rogers, the gallery's assistant director, in 1974 Rubbo began producing a regular listing of Melbourne gallery shows as an informal mimeographed publication, naming it the Art Almanac under which name it continues. The 1974 exhibition A Room of One‚Äôs Own: Three Women Artists, which Rubbo co-curated with Lynne Cook and Janine Burke, helped initiate the Melbourne Women‚Äôs Art Movement. The following year, Rubbo commissioned Burke to curate the national touring exhibition Australian Women Artists 1840‚Äì1940 . The gallery hosted international feminist art critic, Lucy Lippard, who delivered a talk to a women-only audience. Melbourne's Women's Art Forum and Women's Art Register were subsequently established in the gallery.Anne Sanders, 'Visual Arts', The Encyclopaedia of Women & Leadership in Twentieth-Century Australia, Published by the Australian Women's Archives Project 2014, , http://www.womenaustralia.info/leaders/biogs/WLE0448b.htm, accessed 21 January 2018. In 1975, the gallery hosted Stelarc's Insert/Imprint/Extend: event for amplified, modified, monitored man. The exhibition involved Stelarc being continuously physically present in the gallery for 10 days. His bodily sounds including his heart, lungs and muscle movements were recorded and amplified. Following Rubbo's death, Lip feminist art magazine published recollections on her life. Meredith Rogers, Suzanne Davies, Janine Burke and Judy Annear penned contributions. Rogers was Associate Director at the gallery from 1975 to the start of 1979. Her text describes Rubbo's uniquely collaborative and anti- hierarchical working manner, which was conversational, personal, emotional and feminist. In August 2014, Rubbo's curatorial legacy was celebrated in a symposium Kiffy Rubbo: Curating the 1970's hosted by University of Melbourne. The keynote lecture, Kiffy Rubbo, Women Curators and Australian Art Galleries, delivered by Frances Lindsay, former Deputy Director, National Gallery of Victoria, founding director of the Victorian College of the Arts Gallery and Honorary Senior Fellow at the University of Melbourne. The papers from the symposium were edited by Janine Burke and Helen Hughes and published in 2016. Personal life Rubbo was married to architect Dennis Carter. They had three children, Bridie, Darcy and Barny. In 1980, at 36 years old, Rubbo committed suicide.

He is notable for being one of the youngest members elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in its history and for his role in a fraudulent scam involving Investors Overseas Service. Early life King was born February 15, 1927, in Chicago, Illinois. King attended three colleges, but never graduated; University of Washington, Wheaton College and Northwestern University. While a student, he was the national president of the College Republicans.Illinois Blue Book 1955-1956 page 282 Illinois House of Representatives He was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1950 to succeed Lottie Holman O'Neill who vacated the seat to successfully seek election to the Illinois Senate. He was the youngest person elected to the Illinois House of Representatives since Stephen A. Douglas. This record was later broken when Avery Bourne was appointed to the legislature in 2015. While a member of the House, he married his first wife, Carylyn Becker, whom he eventually divorced. He remarried to Mary Louise Gabriel. In the mid-1950s, a mid-decade legislative district reapportionment split the 41st district, which included DuPage and Will counties into multiple districts. King ran in the new 36th district, but lost in a crowded primary field of sixteen candidates., Business career King first became involved in the oil exploration industry through a $1,500 investment in the efforts of an Oklahoma friend. After leaving the Illinois House, he entered the industry full-time, first at King-Stevenson Oil Company in Chicago and later forming King Resources in Denver, Colorado. In 1966, King began to sell two hedge funds, Imperial American and Royal Resources, through his Colorado Corporation. King Resources was a customer of the funds. The sale of these drilling funds to others increased King's profits tenfold. By 1969, the company had 7 million barrels of crude oil and 258 billion cubic feet of natural gas in American and Canadian developed reserves. At this point, the firm was involved in mining operations as well as drilling operations. Activities included oil exploration in the North Sea, molybdenum exploration near Revelstoke, British Columbia and iron ore exploration in Quebec. In 1970, the bubble burst and King Resources lost $53 million in a month, cut staff in half and King resigned from his roles in the company. That year, he went to Europe in an attempt to salvage the failing Investors Overseas Service. He failed and King went bankrupt. King was named in a tongue-in-cheek Cervi's Journal article, nominating him as a 1971 Denver Man Of The Year for \\"his originality and ground-breaking efforts in showing how the wealthy can cut their cost of living.\\" In 1976, King and Boucher were charged after an attempt to defraud 150,000 shareholders of IOS with fraudulent valuations of Arctic oil and gas permits. King was sentenced to one year in prison for fraud. Other political activities For a time, he was the vice-chairman of the Republican National Committee's Finance Committee. During the 1968 U.S. presidential election, King donated $750,000 to the presidential campaign of Richard Nixon. This relationship continued into Nixon's administration. King suggested the idea of the Nixon administration diverting money directly to congressional candidates, rather than going through the usual political channels. This suggestion led to the illegal fundraising operation of Harry S. Dent, Sr. and Dent's subsequent conviction. Nixon appointed King his personal representative, with the rank of Ambassador, to the 1970 Japan World Expo. In the 1974 United States Senate elections, he ran for the United States Senate in Colorado as an independent candidate. He received approximately 2% of the vote. Death King died January 13, 2016, in Denver, Colorado. He was survived by his wife, his four children and his ex-wife.

The sawmill began operation in 1853 as the Redwood Lumber Manufacturing Company, and changed ownership several times before cutting its final logs in 1938. The sawmill site became part of the Big River Unit of Mendocino Headlands State Park where a few features of the mill and its associated forest railway are still visible along the longest undeveloped estuary in northern California. History California Gold Rush entrepreneur Henry Meiggs owned one of California's first sawmills near Bodega. After that sawmill had converted nearby forests to lumber for the booming city of San Francisco, Meiggs investigated reports of coastal forests to the north and shipped a boiler and steam-powered gang sawmill around Cape Horn to be erected on the navigable Big River estuary. After ordering the machinery from eastern manufacturers, E.C. Williams took a shortcut across the isthmus of Panama in the spring of 1852 to survey the Big River in advance of machinery delivery aboard the brig Ontario. The sawmill was completed in the spring of 1853, and produced 50,000 board foot of lumber per day. It was comparatively easy to float logs to the sawmill from trees cut along the shoreline of the estuary, and ships carried the lumber to San Francisco. Remains of bank protection at the log dump pool where logs were rolled off railroad flatcars into Big River. Log storage was about upstream of the sawmill to prevent Pacific surf from breaking containment booms and allowing the river to carry the log inventory out to sea. When the original gang sawmill proved too small for the old-growth Sequoia sempervirens logs, a larger sawmill was built near the boom, but lumber drying and storage for shipment continued on the bluff adjacent to the river mouth. An even larger sawmill was built on the flat near the boom after a fire in 1861. Moving logs to the sawmill became more difficult after the closest trees had been cut. Logs were moved to a natural river pool about upstream of the sawmill, but only during winter storms was river flow adequate to move those logs downstream to the mill. Several dozen dams were built on Big River tributaries upstream of the pool to impound water for sudden release to float log downstream during other seasons. By 1873, the name had changed to Mendocino Lumber Company and the mill was the most important in Mendocino County. By 1883 the difficulties of using horses and oxen for moving logs to the river pool encouraged building railroads to reduce the friction of skidding logs. Railway branches were built to reach trees and then dismantled after those logs had been moved to Big River. Total length of track was never more than . Teams of working animals pulled the logs on flatcars until 1901. The railroad was rebuilt after extensive flood damage in 1904. Union Lumber Company purchased the Mendocino Lumber Company sawmill, railroad, and timberlands in 1906; and again rebuilt the railroad after flood damage in 1907. The buildings of Boyle's logging camp were moved on railway cars when the camp was moved upstream from the Big River confluence with Laguna Creek to the Little North Fork Big River in 1912. The Laguna Creek branch line trestle across Big River was replaced by a Howe truss bridge in the winter of 1919-1920. The sawmill operated until 1931 when Union Lumber Company's Fort Bragg sawmill was able to meet lumber demands decreased by the Great Depression. The railroad was dismantled during 1936 and 1937 when Japanese preparations for World War II raised the value of scrap iron. The sawmill was briefly reopened in 1938 to mill Douglas fir logs salvaged when a log raft from Oregon broke up off the coast of Mendocino. Dinky Locomotive number 1 arrived in July 1901 to improve overland transport of logs from the remaining forests to the pool five miles upstream of the sawmill. It was Baldwin Locomotive Works 0-4-2 tank locomotive #5353 built in 1880 to pull unpowered street cars around Golden Gate Park. This steam dummy weighed 20 tons with a full-length cab covering the boiler to resemble the street cars it pulled. After replacing the teams on 18 August 1900, the cab length was gradually reduced repairing damage from various woods mishaps over the years until it resembled conventional locomotives. As more capable locomotives arrived to share the load, the first locomotive came to be known as the Dinky. Dinky disappeared when the fourth locomotive arrived about 1923, but its disposal is undocumented. Excelsior In the spring of 1902 the company received a new Climax locomotive numbered 2 for logging branches with grades as steep as 12 percent. Excelsior brought logs from the steep branches to the comparatively level main line downstream of Boyle's logging camp, where the Dinky would move them to the log dump five miles upstream of the sawmill. The locomotives were periodically loaded onto a barge at the log dump for transfer downstream to the sawmill for overhaul. On one of these trips Excelsior slipped off the barge into the Big River estuary in March 1921. Grammar school students Alden and Art Rice, considered the best local swimmers, were paid $50 each to brave the cold, -deep water stringing steel recovery cables under the submerged locomotive. The engineer paid each boy an additional $25 to recover his tools which had spilled from the locomotive toolbox. Excelsior was sold to a railfan and left in a shed on the Railroad Gulch branch when the rails were removed. Before the railfan could move the locomotive, it was illegally scrapped by unemployed workmen trying to keep food on their table. Molly In 1910 Union Lumber Company moved locomotive number 3 with about 70 tons of rail from a dismantled Navarro River logging operation about south of Big River. Molly was a 2-4-4 saddle-tank locomotive built by Ricks & Firth. The saddle tank was replaced by square tanks on each running board some time after 1915. When the sawmill ceased operation, Molly was abandoned where the railroad dumped logs into the pool five miles upstream of the sawmill. There she rusted away through World War II until Union Lumber Company bulldozers built a road for the scrapping crew. Fourth locomotive In 1923 Union Lumber Company transferred a locomotive from the California Western Railroad to replace the aged Dinky. This locomotive had been built by Baldwin Locomotive Works as a 2-4-2 tank locomotive in 1884, and became California Western Railroad number 3 in 1895. It had been rebuilt as a 2-4-4 tank locomotive at Fort Bragg, officially retired from California Western service before 1917, and recorded as sold to Mendocino Lumber Company in 1918; but was not delivered until five years later. No documentation has been found indicating this fourth locomotive was named or numbered in service on Big River. This locomotive was rebuilt after being wrecked in a September 1924 runaway derailment when brakes failed on a downhill grade. This locomotive was bringing a woods crew back to the Boyle logging camp in November 1929 when they discovered a burning trestle. The loggers declined engineer Walter Hanson's offer to take them across the burning trestle in time for supper, and watched as Hanson's locomotive fell through the burning trestle attempting the trip alone. The locomotive remained where it fell when the line beyond the trestle was dismantled for scrap, and is presumed to have been scrapped later with Molly.

It includes both residential aged care (nursing homes) as well as services provided in the home such as personal care, domestic assistance, home nursing, nutrition and meal preparation, respite services, continence management, mobility & dexterity assistance, transport, social support and the provision of equipment and aids. In Australia, many aged care services are government subsidised to help keep costs manageable and affordable. Australians who are eligible for government subsidies to help fund the costs of aged care services will still be expected to contribute to the cost of services if they can afford to.  Ageing Population in Australia  Australia‚Äôs population is getting older, due to longer life expectancy and low fertility rates. Results of the 2016 national census show that one in six Australians is now aged over 65. By 2056, it is projected there will be 8.7 million older Australians (22% of the population); by 2096, 12.8 million people (25%) will be aged 65 years and over. The impact of our ageing population is an increase in the number of Australians needing help in aged care. In 2016, almost a quarter of a million people (249,000) were using residential care, home care or transition care services‚Äîa 31% increase over the last decade. The public aged-care system is already under strain, with fewer places than there is demand. By 2060, aged care demands are expected to put additional pressure on Australian governments equivalent to about 6 per cent of national GDP. Since 2012, the government has been introducing reforms that move towards consumer-directed aged care - a more market-driven environment where the consumer (or their carer) can choose their service provider. In response, more private business providers are entering the market, in competition with the government-funded and not-for-profit providers that have historically dominated. However, there is no official government channel that regulates private aged-care providers and reports on their quality of services such as staffing levels and skills and quality of care. The government announced a public inquiry into misconduct in the sector in September 2018. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation produced two-part documentary focusing on alleged neglect and abuse of older people. Service providers, including Estia Health, Regis Healthcare and Japara Healthcare lost about a sixth of their value. Older Australians are now faced with a wider range of options than ever in how they receive aged care services, and who provides them. Aged Care options in Australia The three main options available to older people are: * Stay in their own home and access in-home care and services to help them remain independent. * Move into an aged care home where meals, accommodation and nursing services (if required) are available *Move into a retirement village where some services are available for a fee. In-home Aged Care Most older Australians prefer to remain in their own home as they get older. 83% of people over 60 surveyed in the Housing Decisions of Older Australians research paper by the Australian Government's Productivity Commission in 2015, preferred to continue living in their own home (compared to 6% who preferred living in a retirement villages and 1% in a residential aged care facility.) If a person is generally able to manage but needs extra assistance with day to day tasks, they can access a number of services to support their independence while remaining in their own home. Types of services that people can access in their home include: * Personal care * Domestic assistance * Nutrition and meal preparation * Continence management * Mobility and dexterity assistance * Nursing, allied health and other clinical services * Transport and assistance getting around in their community * Equipment and aids. * Social Support * Flexible Respite * Allied Health Services / Physiotherapy / Occupational Therapy / Dietetics / Podiatry =Funding for In-Home care= There are two types of funding provided by the Australian Government available to help subsidise the costs of in-home aged care services for eligible people. Home Care Package A Home Care Package provides long-term help to allow people to stay independent in their own home as long as possible and offer four levels of care packages to support people with basic, low, intermediate, and high care needs. Depending on the level of support needed, an aged care services provider can work with an individual to create a care plan tailored to their needs. A Home Care Package can deliver a mix of services including: * Personal care * Domestic assistance * Nutrition and meal preparation * Continence management * Mobility and dexterity assistance * Nursing, allied health and other clinical services * Transport and assistance getting around in their community * Provision of equipment and aids * Assistive technology It is possible to change services or move to a different level of package based on changing needs. Older Australians or their carer can contact the My Aged Care service provided by the Australian Government to find out if they can access government funding to help cover the cost of Aged Care Services. My Aged Care can arrange for the person to be assessed by the Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT) or ACAS (Victoria only). The funding a person receive varies depending on the level of their Home Care Package and is paid direct to the service provider. If personal circumstances allow, the Government expects people receiving funding to contribute to the cost of their care. The amount they will need to contribute is based on their income and is determined by the Department of Human Services. =Commonwealth Home Support Programme= If a person only requires short-term help or some assistance with daily activities around the home, the Commonwealth Home Support Programme allows them to access the specific services they need, when they need them. The Commonwealth Home Support Programme lets the older person choose the services they need as required. Services available under the Commonwealth Home Support Programme include: * Personal care * Domestic assistance * Meal preparation * Social support * Flexible respite * Allied Health / Physiotherapy The person can choose from a set menu of services based on when they need them and can enter and leave the programme as their needs change. To access services provided by the Commonwealth Home Support Programme, the person will need to be assessed by a team member from the Regional Assessment Service either in their home or on the phone. The subsidy programme does not necessarily fund the full cost of the service, so each person may pay a small contribution. Special consideration is available to people experiencing financial difficulty. =Costs of in-home Care= If a person is eligible to receive a subsidy from the government, they will still be required to contribute to the cost where their personal circumstances allow. The cost will vary depending on whether the funding is provided under the Commonwealth Home Support Programme or the Home Care Packages Program. If a person is not eligible for a subsidy from the Australian Government, they can still access aged care services privately but will be required to cover the associated costs. 2017 Government changes to in home care In February 2017, the Australian Government introduced Increasing Choice in Home Care reforms. These reforms are designed to give older people more choice and control over their home care. Recipients of government funding to cover the cost of aged care services are now able to choose their preferred provider of in home aged care services. They can also choose to change their provider at any time. Once a person‚Äôs application for funding is successful, they will be allocated their funding based on how long they have been waiting and also on their individual care needs and personal circumstances. A person can accrue unspent funds that are left over from their package after any expenses and fees have been deducted. If they change home care provider these unspent funds will be transferred to the new provider. After 27 February 2017, aged care providers are able to charge customers an exit fee to cover administrative costs which will be deducted from any unspent funds. Providers are legally required to publish their maximum exit fees on the My Aged Care website. Not all providers require exit fees. Aged care homes As people grow older, they may need more help with day-to-day tasks or health care. In some cases the best way to receive help and support can be by living in an aged care home (also known as nursing homes) either on a permanent basis or for a short stay (called \\"residential respite\\"). Aged care homes offer accommodation services (also known as ‚Äúhotel services‚Äù) and personal care assistance (e.g. bathing & personal hygiene, continence management, dressing). Aged care homes may also provide complex care and services such as specialised bedding materials, non-customised mobility goods, incontinence aids, nursing services and allied health services. Most aged care homes in Australia receive funding from the Australian Government. The aged care system in Australia aims to make sure that all older people can receive support and quality care when they need it. If a person‚Äôs care needs are less than those supplied by an aged care home, independent living units or retirement villages are an alternative. These residential communities offer a variety of services for older people to help them live independently, and are regulated by state and territory governments. A younger person with disabilities can also live in residential aged care settings. As of 2015, over 7,000 young disabled people lived in aged care homes. A goal of the National Disability Insurance Scheme is to get younger people with disabilities out of residential age care settings. =Funding for residential Aged Care= The Australian Government funds the majority of aged care in Australia but people are expected to contribute to the cost of their care if they can afford to. There are also specific programmes and information available to Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people; people from culturally or linguistically diverse backgrounds; people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex; or Care-Leavers. Older veterans, those who are financially disadvantaged, people living with disability and those living away from large towns can also access tailored support. To determine eligibility to receive funding, a member of an Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT, or ACAS in Victoria) will carry out an assessment with the person to identify their needs and circumstances and work out what options are available to them. Aged Care Assessment Whether an older person requires help with basic tasks at home or more intensive aged care services, they will need to arrange an assessment with the My Aged Care service. My Aged Care will register the person‚Äôs details and ask them a series of questions to help identify their needs and circumstances such as: * any support they are currently receiving * if they have any health concerns * how they are managing with activities around the home * some questions relating to their safety in the home From there they may be referred for a home support assessment, a comprehensive assessment, or direct referral to services. =Home support assessment= If a person has entry level aged care needs, My Aged Care may arrange a home support assessment to identify their care needs. The assessment will be undertaken by a local assessor from the My Aged Care Regional Assessment Service. =Comprehensive assessment= If the older person has more complex aged care needs, a comprehensive assessment by a member of an Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT, or ACAS in Victoria) may be organised for them if they want to access government funded services or if they are considering moving into an aged care home. A person may also need to have a comprehensive assessment if they are ready to leave hospital, or if they need a short break in an aged care home (also called 'respite care').

Early life Hesse spent most of his childhood in Creutzwald, where he started to play football. Career =Playing= Until age 16, Hesse played amateur football in Creutzwald before moving to ply his trade with a club in Saint-Avold and then in Merlebach. On one occasion, he could have signed for FC Metz in 1980 but financial difficulties precluded the club from making the deal. =France= Spending seven years in charge of US Forbach in the Championnat de France Amateur, Hesse joined AS Nancy as a coach in 1999 where he served in numerous positions until 2010- one season as manager of the U-17 side, eight seasons in charge of the U18 Training and Educator Center, and three seasons responsible for pre-training. Three years later, in 2014, the Creutzwald native went back to France owing to the fact that the Stade Laval manager at the time, Denis Zanko, contacted him for the assistant job, which he took and signed a one and a half year contract. =Dudelange= Back in November 2012, Hesse replaced Didier Philippe as manager of F91 Dudelange in the Luxembourg National Division. Six months later, he left the Luxembourgish outfit by mutual agreement and took a ten- month managerial training course. =Africa= One of Hesse's contacts, Michel Gruhn, put him in touch with then Mali coach Henryk Kasperczak, who hired Hesse with immediate effect as assistant since he knew him from his time with FC Metz. A month later, the assistant manager followed Henryk Kasperczak to coach Tunisia after Mali's participation in the CAN 2015. That summer, however, Hesse's contract was cancelled by the board for various purposes. =Young Lions= Hesse was given the Young Lions manager role ahead of the 2016 S.League as part of a coaching contingent summoned by FAS technical director Michel Sablon to go to Singapore. Even though the Frenchman arrived in Singapore in January, his official appointment as coach was deferred until he got his work pass one month later and was sanctioned to do business in the country. His first match in charge was a 1-0 triumph over Balestier Khalsa before losing twice in a row to Albirex Niigata S and Geylang International by 5-0 and 2-0 goal deficits. Early in the season, Hesse was also impressed with Albirex Niigata Singapore and wanted the Young Lions to model their style of play after Albirex Niigata's. Ahead of the 2017 S.League, Hesse left his post, having not been complacent with the club's last place finish. Personal life The former player is married and has children.

She was principal of University Women's College, at the University of Melbourne from 1947 to 1960. Roper wrote five books about China to encourage sympathy and acceptance of the new People's Republic of China, including a book for children. Her papers are collected in the National Library of Australia.  Early life and education  Born in Haworth, Yorkshire in 1911, Roper was educated at Newnham College, Cambridge, graduating in 1933, and a Diploma in Teaching from the Institute of Education, London University in 1934. She taught in England and Canada, and was an Assistant Education officer in England.  Career in Australia  Roper came to Australia in 1947 to become the third Principal of University Women's College, at the University of Melbourne, a role she held until 1960. She gained her MA from the University of Melbourne in 1947. She was an active fundraiser and built three new accommodation wings for female students who came from the country and from Asia, tripling the college's size. The third building, completed after she left the college was named for her. The building is being replaced by the College in 2017, and will retain her name. A scholarship for a graduate student from China to University College also bears her name. A biography of this time was published in 1989. Roper was an active broadcaster, appearing regularly on television, for example on the ABC program Meet (1957), and on Chanel 7 as co-host with Bill Acfield of Letter Box (1962) and Party Time (1963). She sat on the ABC Advisory Committee, the Elizabethan Theatre Trust and the Melbourne State College boards. She also published articles and gave speeches on education and encouraging women's representation in public life.  Australia‚ÄìAsia relations  Roper was particularly influential in her work travelling to Asia and building Australia‚ÄìChina relations between the 1950s and 1980s. She visited China 15 times, and wrote four books about her travels. She was also 'the first Australian to make a television documentary of China during the Maoist era\\". She became the President of the Committee for Australia China Relations. After retiring from University College, she focused on her broadcasting and the delegations to China. In 1965 she moved to Canberra, the national capital, to continue her work. Images of her travels to Thailand, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, among others, are held in the Monash University Library.

Early life and education Barnard was born in Melbourne on 5 August 1908. Her mother, Jessie Margaret Barnard, helped found the Federal Territory War Food Fund. Her father, Robert James Allman Barnard, became a foundation professor of mathematics at the Royal Military College, Duntroon near Canberra, where the family moved in 1911. They returned to Melbourne in the 1920s, when Barnard's father took a position as senior lecturer at the University of Melbourne. Barnard entered the University of Melbourne in 1927. She won a Dixson Scholarship in 1930, the same year that she completed a B.A. with honours in mathematics. She added a B.S. in physics in 1931 and an M.S. in 1932. Her master's thesis concerned the continuum mechanics of a cracked thin plate, and was supervised by John Henry Michell. In search of a subject that would bring her into more contact with other people, and discouraged by the job prospects for mathematicians and physicists in Australia, Barnard shifted her interests to biometrics. She began her doctoral studies in statistics with Ronald Fisher in the Galton Laboratory at University College London in 1934. She published three papers in this period, on craniometry, factorial experiments, and environmental statistics, and completed her Ph.D. in 1936. Career and later life After completing her education, Barnard returned to Australia and became an assistant biometrician in the Division of Forest Products of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, beginning in 1936. Although centred at Melbourne, her position also involved spending time in Canberra and Sydney. While at CSIR she worked with Betty Allan. Topics that Barnard researched were the 'holding power of coach screws and the serviceability of railway sleepers and telegraph poles'. In the normal course of events, she would have lost the position when she married in 1939, but the outbreak of World War II, and the need for wood in airplanes, caused greater demands on her office, so her resignation was delayed until the birth of her first child in 1941. While raising a family, she lectured part-time at the University of Melbourne until she and her family moved to Brisbane, where her husband found a position as professor of electrical engineering at the University of Queensland. She continued her part-time lecturing there and, in 1970, she was appointed as lecturer in mathematical statistics at the University of Queensland. In 1972 she became the first Chairwoman (1972) of the Brisbane Branch of the International Biometric Society, Australasian Region. She died in Brisbane on 9 March 2000. Book Barnard's book Elementary Statistics for Use in Timber Research (with Neil Ditchburn, CSIRO, 1956) was published after being printed twice for CSIRO use.

Having begun business in the cotton trade, the firms moved into sugar products and exported coffee, molasses, rum and sugar from the West Indies. They owned ships and plantations, and engaged in both slavery and transport of indentured labour.  Formation  The origins of Sandbach, Tinne & Company, together with its related firms, can be traced to James McInroy, a Scot from near Pitlochry who was trading in Grenada from 1782. Another of the original partners was Charles Stuart Parker, who arrived in Grenada to work as a clerk for his merchant uncle, George Robertson, in 1789. These men, too, were of Scots origin and within months of Parker's arrival arrangements were being made for them to form a trading partnership with a third Scotsman, a Mr Gordon. That partnership began operations in 1790 but soon hit difficulties as both uncle and nephew became upset with Gordon's behaviour. Gordon ceased to be a partner and McInroy joined them while continuing also independently to operate a business in the Dutch colony of Demerara. In 1792, the partnership was expanded to include Samuel Sandbach, an Englishman who had arrived in Grenada in 1788 to work for his uncle, who shared the same name and was also an established merchant there. Sandbach had gravitated to being a clerk for the McInroy, Parker and Robertson partnership and had impressed them so much that they invited him to join their firm on an equal standing. The firm was initially involved in exporting cotton and coffee, and in importing manufactured goods from Britain McInroy had set up a store in Demerara in 1790 and was using ships to trade between there and Grenada. Although the partnership owned at least two cotton plantations in Demerara, it was the success of the store that became the most significant aspect of the new enterprise and it resulted in Parker and Robertson returning to Britain to develop business contacts. The two men set sail in haste for Grenada in 1795 when they heard news that the combination of a French landing on the island and an uprising by African slaves there was threatening British rule. McInroy managed to escape the island with around ¬£9000 in goods by using the partnership's sloop, called Rambler, which then evaded a close-fought boarding attempt by a French privateer. The partners reconvened in Demerara but trade became difficult in the following months and it was insufficient to support all four men. While McInroy and Sandbach concentrated on the trading aspect and eventually formed the Demerara-based firm of McInroy, Sandbach & Company in 1801, Parker and Robertson went to live on and develop one cotton plantation each. Robertson died in 1799, two years after Parker had returned to Scotland and married Margaret Rainy, a niece of Robertson. Parker went back to Demerara to oversee business. McInroy, Parker and Sandbach all returned to Britain in 1801, after the foundation of the Demerara firm. Once there, they established in Glasgow the firm of McInroy, Parker & Company as the Scottish arm of their venture. A year later, they formed another branch in Liverpool, where Sandbach moved around the time that he married Elizabeth Robertson in December. Elizabeth was another of George Robertson's nieces. William McBean, another Scot, joined the Demerara partnership in 1803 but had left by around 1808 and subsequently became a partner with Robert Kingston. In 1813, the prosperous and well-connected Phillip Frederick Tinne, a Dutchman of Huguenot descent who already had experience of working coffee plantations in Demerara, joined the firm in Liverpool as a full partner.  Activities  Having begun in the cotton trade, the partners changed course and became involved in production of sugar from around 1810. The firms became known as the \\"Rothchilds of Demerara\\". The enterprise grew to become owners of both ships and plantations and also exporters of coffee, molasses, rum and sugar from the West Indies to the British ports of Liverpool and Glasgow. They were significant slave owners until that practice was abolished. By far the largest owner of plantations and slaves in what was by then British Guiana, the provisions for compensation to slave owners made under the terms of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 resulted in a payment of ¬£150,452 to Sandbach, Tinne & Company. The compensation was the second-largest payment made to any mercantile concern.https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/8821 From the 1830s until the 1920s were major transporters of indentured labour. The latter became a feature of society in British Guiana following emancipation of slaves because plantation owners needed a new source of labour and they found it in the importation of people from India. The name of the Demerara firm was changed from McInroy, Sandbach & Co. to Sandbach, Parker & Co. in 1861. The firm, which continued its interests in shipping and sugar, was wound up and held its last meeting in London in 1975.  Flag  The distinctive crest used by the firms may owe its origin to the incident with the Rambler which, sailing without a flag and being threatened with boarding, improvised a solution by sewing together a white shirt between the legs of a pair of blue trousers. The letters \\"STC\\" were added at a later date.  Families  The business relationships were to entwined by marriage. Not only were two of the founding partners married to nieces of a third such partner, Robertson, but the son of Parker married a daughter of Sandbach. Another daughter of Sandbach married John Abraham Tinne, a son of Phillip Tinne. Sandbach and Tinne lived next-door to each other for some time, at 27 and 29 St Anne Street, Liverpool, from where they had a good view of shipping on the River Mersey. George Rainy, a nephew of Robertson and brother of Parker's wife, also became a partner and was the main representative in Demerara from around 1808 to 1837, when he returned to Britain. Other notable relations of the four founding partners include Charles Stuart Parker and Emily Tinne. When Sandbach formally left the partnership in November 1833, having by that time been mayor of Liverpool, two of his sons took over his interest in the firms. James McInroy had died in 1825; his son, James Patrick McInroy, was also a partner in Sandbach, Tinne & Co. The involvement of the founding families continued thereafter and around 1900 the partners included John Ernest Tinne (1845-1925), Charles Sandbach Parker (1864-1920), Evelyn Stuart Parker (1870-1936), and John Abraham Tinne (1877-1933).

He was appointed suffect consul in the nundinium of May to June 100 as the colleague of Lucius Herennius Saturninus. He is known through surviving inscriptions, and was a correspondent of Pliny the Younger. His full name is Pomponius T.f. Gal. Mamilianus Rufus Antistianus Funisulanus Vettonianus, as attested in an inscription recovered at Deva. The sources conflict over his praenomen, however. The Fasti Ostienses show it to be \\"Lucius\\"; a military diploma shows it to be \\"Titus\\"; and the British inscription mentioned above is damaged at that point, and cannot be used to resolve the matter. As for the final element in his name, \\"Funisulanus Vettonianus\\", authorities agree it indicates some connection to the general and suffect consul of 78 Lucius Funisulanus Vettonianus, but disagree what connection he has. Some have argued that this is evidence of a Pomponius being adopted by testament by the older Funisulanus Vettonianus, while others have argued he is a son or nephew of the older Vettonianus being adopted by a Pomponius. Olli Salomies concurs with Ronald Syme, and interprets this name as evidence Mamilianus' father or grandfather married a Funisulana, that is a female relative of the older Funisulanus Vettonianus.Salomies, Adoptive and polyonymous nomenclature in the Roman Empire, (Helsinski: Societas Scientiarum Fenica, 1992), pp. 88, 133f  Life  The cursus honorum of Mamilianus is incomplete. The inscription from Deva attests that he was the commander of the legion stationed at the Roman fort at Deva, which at the time was Legio XX Valeria Victrix.Birley, The Fasti of Roman Britain (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981), p. 235 Anthony Birley notes that \\"he was in his early thirties\\" when he commanded the legion, offers a date for this command as \\"the early 90s\\", and notes Mamilianus \\"must have owed this appointment to Domitian.\\" Copies of two letters Pliny wrote to him have survived; A.N. Sherwin-White dates them to the period 107 to 108. One, written while Pliny was busy with the grape harvest, mentions Mamilianus' love of hunting.Pliny, Epistulae, IX.16 The other alludes to Mamilianus living a military life,Pliny, Epistulae, IX.25 which has been interpreted as evidence that he was governing a military province, which would also be an appointment at the pleasure of the emperor.Birley, Fasti of Roman Britain, p. 235; C.P. Jones, \\"A New Commentary on the Letters of Pliny\\", Phoenix, 22 (1968), p. 127 Birley notes that the suffect consul of 121, Titus Pomponius Antistianus Funisulanus Vettonianus, is \\"presumably\\" his son.

S. Puttaswamy (born 8 February 1926) is a retired Judge of the Karnataka High Court who was also the original petitioner, challenging the Government of India over making Aadhaar mandatory. He had filed a writ petition in 2012 and over the last five years, 26 other petitions have been tagged along with his, challenging the scheme. Education K.S. Puttaswamy studied at the Maharaja's College, Mysore and the Government Law College in Bangalore. Career He enrolled as an advocate in 1952. He was appointed judge of the Karnataka High Court in November 1977. He was appointed as the first Vice-Chairman of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Bangalore Bench in September 1986. In November 1989, he was appointed as First Chairman of the Andhra Pradesh Administrative Tribunal constituted under the Uniform Administrative Tribunals Act. On 26 January 1994, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Kotla Vijayabhaskara Reddy constituted the Backward Classes Commission under the Chairmanship of Justice K. S. Puttaswamy. Jurisprudence & Litigation =Income-Tax Act, 1961= In the case of B.S. Jayachandra vs Income-Tax Officer And Anr. on 24 March 1986, the petitioner urged that section 2(14)(iii) of the Act dealing with income \\"arising from sale of lands used for agricultural purposes\\" is outside the legislative competence of the centre as the subject is exclusively assigned to states either under Entry No. 18 or 46 of List II, State List of the 7th Schedule to the Constitution. Justice Puttaswamy observed that there isn't a difference and distinction between agricultural lands in India as defined in section 2(14) or lands used for agricultural purposes. The income from the sale of such lands will not be revenue income but will be income from a capital asset and will naturally be capital gains chargeable to tax on that basis and no other. In other words, the user of lands for agriculture or other purpose cannot and does not make any difference to decide the nature of the gains made on the transfer of the capital asset. In rejecting the contention of the petitioner, Justice Puttaswamy opined that the Union Parliament was competent to define the terms \\"agricultural income\\", \\"agricultural land\\" and \\"capital asset\\" and thus bring to tax capital gains arising or accruing from agricultural lands situated within municipal limits and eight kilometres of notified municipal areas, which had ceased to be agricultural lands. =Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944= The Assistant Collector of Central Excise, IDO No. 23, Bangalore-1 issued show cause notice No. C. No. V. 23A(17)18/75 to the petitioner, M/s Alembic Glass Industries Ltd., Baroda, a public limited company, proposing to withdraw or revoke the provisional approval accorded by the Superintendent of Central Excise, Bangalore, which allowed the cost of ‚Äòcartons‚Äô or ‚Äòpacking materials‚Äô supplied by its buyers to be not includible in the assessable value of excisable goods manufactured and supplied to its wholesale purchasers. The petitioner contended that the packing material supplied by buyers is not includible in the assessable value of ‚Äòglass and glassware‚Äô manufactured and supplied to the wholesale buyers under the Act and therefore, the impugned notice is manifestly illegal. Counsel for the Central Government, appearing for the respondents contended that the Court should decline to interfere with the show cause notice on the ground that it is open to the petitioner to show cause, which the authority is bound to examine and decide and that the ultimate order to be made was appealable under the Act. Rejecting this objection by the respondent, Justice Puttaswamy observed that \\"this case for reasons that are not necessary to examine, has been pending before this Court for more than 9 years. If at this stage, this Court were to decline to interfere, though there is no dispute on facts, the final determination of the question that arises is likely to take another decade\\" and proceeded to examine the merits. Holding that ‚Äòpacking materials‚Äô are supplied by the buyers only and that the same is neither manufactured nor purchased by the petitioner to supply its manufactured articles to the wholesale purchasers, Justice Puttaswamy dismissed the writ petition and quashed the impugned show cause notice issued by the Assistant Collector. =Central Sales Tax Act, 1956= M/s. Mac Charles Brothers (Private) Limited had undertaken the construction of a five star hotel on premises No. 28, Sankey Road, Bangalore City and made an application before the Commercial Tax Officer \\"CTO\\", X Additional Circle, Bangalore under the Central Sales Tax \\"CST\\" Act of 1956 and the Central Sales Tax (Registration and Turnover) Rules, 1957 for registration in dealing with the articles detailed in an annexure to that application. On an examination of the same, the CTO issued a registration certificate on 23 January 1984, to be valid from 9 October 1983, for certain specified goods only and impliedly rejected the same for all other goods. In so far as the CTO rejected the said application, the petitioner approached the Court in Writ Petition No. 15158 of 1984 which was disposed of by the Court on 10 October 1984, with a direction to the CTO to redetermine the matter. In compliance of that order, the CTO heard the petitioner and made an order on 18 October 1984 accepting the case of the petitioner for \\"cold storage and refrigeration equipment\\" and rejecting the same for all other goods. The petitioner has challenged the order dated 18 October 1984, of the CTO to the extent it has rejected its application and has sought for a writ in the nature of mandamus to the CTO to include all goods specified in its application. In quashing the impugned order except to the extent of \\"building materials and stones\\" and issuing a writ in the nature of mandamus to the respondent to include all other items refused in that order in the certificate of registration already issued to the petitioner under the CST Act, Justice Puttaswamy noted \\"When I examine the claim made by the petitioner with reference to every one of the items for which it had registration, it is not possible to hold that they are not integrally connected with the ultimate production of goods. In this view, the rejection by the CTO was unjustified and illegal.\\" =Right to Privacy, 2012= Retired Justice K.S. Puttaswamy turned litigant for the first time in his legal career, spanning five decades, when he petitioned the Supreme Court against the linking of state benefits to the UID scheme saying that much money has been wasted on the ‚Äòdangerous‚Äô project. Arguing passionately that \\"It is a clear violation of citizens privacy and among various other reasons this program was rejected by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance, but still the Government of India went ahead with it. How can this awfully wrong program roll out without a clear legislation?\\", Justice K.S. Puttaswamy filed the PIL for scrapping the Aadhar project in 2012. On 24 August 2017, a nine judge bench of the Supreme Court of India in a remarkable and wide ranging 547-page judgment ruled unanimously that privacy is a constitutionally protected right in India in the case of Puttaswamy v Union of India. With the Supreme Court declaring the Right to Privacy a fundamental right, Justice K.S. Puttaswamy said \\"I am completely vindicated by the decision. My contention had always been that Aadhaar enrolment can be made voluntary, in which case I would not have petitioned\\". In February 2020, the High Court of Kenya at Nairobi referred to the Indian Supreme Court judgment in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Another v. Union of India and Others to hold that biometric data is necessary for identification purposes and adopted the findings in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) on the necessity of different types of biometric data in identification. Views and opinions =Dams and Environment= Justice Puttaswamy felt that courts cannot and should not interfere with the construction of dams. He wrote \\"In my view, the one and only question, on which we should focus our attention is, that in the construction of dams in future, the principle of the \\"greatest good to the greatest number\\" which necessarily results in some hardship and inconvenience to a few cannot be avoided, must alone be the guide.Need to Avoid Doctrinaire Approach, Freedom First, No. 433, April‚ÄìJune 1997 http://freedomfirst.in/uploads/issues/pdf/433.pdf He advocated for the construction of smaller dams, rather than mighty ones, with lesser ecological effects and wrote that even this, is a matter for experts to decide, not for the courts. He suggested that before undertaking construction of any dam, there should be a complete, full and impartial investigation of all aspects. In the course of investigation, all the affected parties, the environmentalists and the general public must be involved and their views and objections duly considered by the experts and decided on merit and not on any collateral considerations. Once that is done, dams should be constructed, with speed and dispatch, avoiding all escalations in costs. Observing that courts cannot and should not interfere with the construction of dams, he said \\"With all due respects, the interference by our Supreme Court in the Narmada Dam matter is not legally sound and justified\\". He observed that the principle of \\"equitable apportionment\\", \\"protection of existing users\\" or \\"first in time, first in right\\" evolved in settlement of international rivers or inter-state river disputes, firmly established and applied, can neither be doubted nor given a go by based on a doctrinaire approach. =Interlinking of Rivers= Justice Puttaswamy wrote that he asked a leading Swiss expert on dams, Raymond Lafitte, when he was visiting New Delhi, what his view was on China‚Äôs Three Gorges Project.Interlinking of Rivers in India, Freedom First, No. 563, May 2014, http://freedomfirst.in/uploads/issues/pdf/563.pdf Raymond Lafitte thought for a while and said that it was a most laudable venture because after just two decades it would take to build, commission and operate, 50 million people downstream would be able to cultivate their lands without flooding and be assured of regular releases. When Justice Puttaswamy questioned ‚Äòwhat about the over one million people that have been deprived of their homes and have to be resettled elsewhere on account of this mega project?‚Äô, he replied ‚ÄòThat is the price we must pay for future progress!‚Äô. In response, Justice Puttaswamy told the Swiss expert that \\"the Three Gorges Project ‚Äì beneficial as it is in the long run ‚Äì can never be a possibility in India, under a democracy based on individual rights and freedoms.\\" Three Gorges project implementation had commenced in 1999 and the same may take another 10 years to complete. Justice Puttaswamy observed that what has been stated by the Swiss expert, applies equally to the Interlinking of Inter State Rivers in India. Justice Puttaswamy hoped to stimulate an intellectual discussion by intellectuals, experts and the public expressing their views, either for or against the same and forwarding them to the Secretary, Ministry of Water Resources for further action. He observed that this topic is of utmost importance and aspired to generate a useful discussion leading to a public demand for the implementation of interlinking of rivers which will benefit the people of India as a whole.

Belenko's defection caused tension between Japan and the USSR, especially after Japanese and American specialists disassembled and examined the aircraft. This examination revealed to the US that, while impressive in speed, the MiG-25 was not the super-fighter that they had feared it to be. It was later returned to the USSR still disassembled with some parts missing. Belenko was granted political asylum in and later citizenship of the US, where he became a military consultant, public speaker, and businessman. Belenko later visited Moscow in 1995, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Background During the Cold War, there were many defections by pilots and aircrews. In addition to pilots defecting of their own volition, there were Western efforts to encourage defections, beginning with the US Operation Moolah aimed at encouraging MiG-15 pilots in North Korea to defect. The Kuomintang ruling Taiwan offered gold to defecting Chinese pilots, and the US Operation Fast Buck was similar to Operation Moolah, although aimed at encouraging a MiG-21 pilot in North Vietnam to defect. Operation Diamond was an Israeli operation similar to Operation Fast Buck, and was successful in getting an Iraqi pilot to defect with his MiG-21. Belenko was not the only pilot to have defected from the USSR in this way, nor was he the first such to defect from a Soviet-bloc country.

The MiG-29 was returned to the USSR.MiG returned to Soviet Union, United Press International, May 21, 1989. In September 1976, Belenko was stationed in Chuguyevka Air Base in the Far East. The infrastructure in the base was severely lacking, the troops' morale was low, and when Belenko made suggestions, he was only derided by the political officer. Additionally, his wife Lyudmila, unhappy with the life of a military wife, had told him she was going to file for divorce in October and move with their son, Dmitry (born 1973), back to her parents' home in Magadan. That contributed to Belenko becoming disillusioned with the Communist system.> Defection flight Chuguyevka Air Base Japan Air Self Defense Force F-4EJs of 302 Squadron On September 6, 1976 Belenko and several other pilots from his squadron of the Soviet Air Defense Force took off from Chuguyevka Air Base around from Vladivostok on a training flight. Belenko followed the flight plan at first, climbing before descending rapidly and heading out to sea. At around 1:10 p.m. Japanese radar detected Belenko's plane and at around 1:20 p.m. two F-4EJ fighters of the 302nd Tactical Fighter Squadron took off from Chitose Air Base near Sapporo. Belenko's map of Hokkaido had only shown Chitose Air Base, and he had planned to land there. He had expected to be intercepted and escorted by military aircraft to a military base, either Chitose or another one. However, the weather was very cloudy and the Japanese ground radar was not able to adequately track Belenko's aircraft. The Japanese F-4s were new aircraft, only having entered JASDF service in 1974. However, they had poor ‚Äúlook down shoot down‚Äù radar and were unable to locate the aircraft either. With fuel running low and needing to land quickly, he finally located Hakodate Airport in southern Hokkaido. Landing Hakodate Airport in 1976 Belenko circled Hakodate three times and landed at the airport. On landing he almost hit a Boeing 727 airliner that was taking off. Hakodate Airport was too short for his aircraft, so despite deploying the plane's drogue parachute the front landing gear's tyre burst and the aircraft ran off off the end of the runway. It finally stopped just before the localizer antenna with approximately 30 seconds of fuel remaining. Belenko had intended to land at a military airbase and had not planned to arrive at a civilian airport. Local people and workers began to gather and some started taking pictures. Belenko fired into the air with his service pistol. The Hakodate Air Traffic Controller contacted the SDF but was told to call the police. The police arrived around 2:10 p.m. and closed down the airport. Belenko in Japan Belenko was arrested by Hokkaido police for violating Japanese airspace and firearms offences. When interviewed by the police, he requested political asylum in the US. The Soviet Union requested an interview with Belenko and for him to be returned to their custody. On September 7th Belenko was moved to Tokyo and on the 8th the US announced that it had granted him political asylum. On September 9th a representative from the Soviet embassy met with Belenko and tried to convince him to return to the USSR, but was unsuccessful. After that Belenko left Japan on a Northwest Orient Airlines flight for the US. On September 9th the Ministry of Justice gave jurisdiction over the MiG to the Defense Agency. The Soviet Union insisted that Belenko had lost his way and later that he had been drugged by the Japanese. Japanese fishing vessels were seized and their crews imprisoned in what was thought to be retaliation for Japan not returning Belenko and not sending the MiG back promptly.

There were fears that there could be a Soviet attack or attempt to recover the aircraft, either by air or by Soviet agents. =Ground Self-Defense Force= The 11th Division of the GSDF, based in Hakodate was preparing for an open day. After the MiG landed 200 troops deployed to Hakodate Airport with Type 61 tanks and 35mm L-90 anti-aircraft weapons along with men of the 28th Light Infantry Regiment. Three unknown aircraft came from the west and warning shots were fired. The aircraft turned out to be Kawasaki C-1 transport planes of the JASDF. As this was done without civilian authorization the documents regarding this were subsequently destroyed. =Maritime Self-Defense Force= The JMSDF deployed vessels around Hokkaido. It had three vessels on the Sea of Japan side and two ships on the Pacific side. Between September 8th and 25th the MSDF patrolled the Tsugaru Strait between Hokkaido and Honshu. At the same time, MSDF helicopters of the ≈åminato Base continually patrolled the Tsugaru Strait. =Air Self Defence Force= With multiple Soviet military aircraft bases close to Hokkaido the F-4EJ fighter aircraft of the JASDF conducted 24-hour patrols over Hokkaido in order to intercept any incoming aircraft. MiG moved After its arrival at Hakodate Airport the MiG-25 had been covered to obscure it. Inspecting it closely at a small civilian airport was impractical and it was too large to be moved by Japanese aircraft. On September 25th it was partly disassembled and taken from Hakodate Airport to Hyakuri Air Base north of Tokyo on a US Air Force Lockheed C-5A Galaxy cargo plane. A banner on the plane (in Japanese) read ‚ÄúGoodbye people of Hakodate, Sorry for the trouble‚Äù. The C-5A was escorted by F-4 Phantoms on its flight from Hokkaido to Honshu. Examination at Hyakuri When Belenko left his base on September 6th he had brought a training manual for the aircraft, expecting that he would be demonstrating it to the US Air Force. Given the Soviet pressure to return the aircraft Japan did not permit the US to take the aircraft or to fly it. However, Japanese and American technicians did disassemble it at Hyakuri and analyze it in detail. Eventually it was packed up into around 40 boxes and was returned to the Soviet Union. The Soviets complained that around 20 pieces were missing. On November 15th it was shipped from Hitachi in Ibaraki to the Soviet Union. Aftermath =Viktor Belenko= Viktor Belenko moved to the US, was debriefed extensively by the CIA and US military, learned English and gradually adapted to life in the US. The story of his life in the Soviet Union, his defection and his early time in the US was written by John Barron in the book MiG Pilot: The Final Escape of Lieutenant Belenko, published in 1980. Belenko later became a consultant to the US military and aerospace industry, a public speaker and businessman. He also married an American woman and had two children. They later divorced. He never divorced his wife in Russia. =Japan= The Soviet government was extremely displeased with the situation and sent Japan a demand for $10 million for the damage to the plane. Japan charged the USSR $40,000 for the damage to Hakodate Airport and shipping costs. Neither bill is known to have been paid. While Belenko's flight had been a defection and not an attack, it had highlighted shortcomings in Japan's air defense system. The inability of Japanese radar to track him and of Japanese fighters to intercept him led to changes in the Japanese defense system. The JASDF purchased Grumman E-2 Hawkeye airborne warning aircraft and several years later purchased McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagles with better look-down radar capacities. The F-15's development had been spurred on by US fears about the MiG-25's capabilities. Japan also later updated the systems of its F-4s to have improved look-down capacities. =Soviet Union= A committee visited Chuguyevka air base and were shocked by what they found there. They immediately decided to improve conditions, built a five-story government building, school, kindergarten and other facilities. Treatment of pilots in the Russian Far East region was improved. Prior to Belenko's defection the outside world had very little knowledge about the MiG-25. The breaching of secrecy around the MiG-25 meant that it could be exported outside the Soviet Union, which it was. It was later operated by Algeria, Bulgaria, India, Iraq, Libya, and Syria. After the dissolution of the USSR it was also operated by the successor states Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia, Turkmenistan and Ukraine. The MiG-31 Foxhound was already in development at the time of Belenko's defection and had first flown in September 1975. Belenko was aware of this \\"Super Foxbat\\" and informed the US after his defection. The MiG-31 was to gradually replace the MiG-25 in Soviet and later in Russian service. =United States= Iraqi Air Force MiG-25 captured in 2003 The US was relieved to discover that the MiG-25 was less advanced but still continued with development of the F-15, which was partly designed to counter the MiG-25. The two models of aircraft were later to meet several times in battle over the Middle East. In the 1980s Israeli F-15As shot down Syrian MiG-25s on several occasions and US F-15s engaged Iraqi Air Force MiG-25s three times during the 1991 Gulf War. On January 17, 1991 MiG-25s and F-15Cs both fired missiles at each other to no effect. On January 19th 1991 two F-15Cs shot down two MiG-25PDs. In the Samurra Air Battle of January 30, 1991 two Iraqi MiG-25s fought two flights of US F-15Cs with neither side scoring kills. While the US had been unable to keep Belenko's MiG-25P in 1976, it eventually obtained an Iraqi MiG-25 after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. An Iraqi Air Force reconnaissance model, MiG-25RB (s/n 25105) is in the restoration facility at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio, US. This aircraft was located in 2003 during the opening months of Operation Iraqi Freedom by American forces, buried in the sand near Al Taqaddum Airbase, about west of Baghdad. The aircraft had been buried to prevent its destruction on the ground by coalition aircraft. When uncovered, the MiG-25RB was incomplete, as the wings could not be located. This aircraft was one of two MiG-25s transported by a Lockheed C-5A Galaxy from Iraq to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base for examination. It was donated to the National Museum of the United States Air Force in December 2006. The museum's restoration staff are currently attempting to locate a set of wings to complete the aircraft for display.\\"Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25.\\" nationalmuseum.af.mil.

It forms part of the Emerald Hill Conservation Area within the Orchard district in central Singapore. Peranakan Place comprises a row of six two-storey shophouses facing Orchard Road, built around 1902 at the intersection of Emerald Hill Road and Orchard Road in the planning area of Newton in Singapore. In 1895, it became the pilot restoration and development project conducted by the Urban Development Authority (URA). It is now used as a commercial building that contains a variety of developments. The shophouse is an iconic South-East Asian design that was popular in the 1960s and has recently experienced a revival due to the growing focus on historical preservation. The entrance is on Emerald Hill Road at the Orchard Road junction. History = Origins of the land = From 1836 to 1900s, the Emerald Hill estate was held under successive, single ownerships. William Cuppage, one of the early European settlers in Singapore was the first legal owner and occupant of the land, and after his death, it was his son-in-law, Edwin Koek. It was later in 1900 that two enterprising business men, Seah Boon Kang and Seah Eng Kiat subdivided the land into 28 building lots and sold most of them. And that was how Emerald Hill and where Peranakan Place would eventually begin. Prominent late architect and conservationist Lee Kip Lin in his publication Emerald Hill: The story of a street in words and pictures (1984) reckoned that around 40 percent of the occupants in the 1930s were Peranakan, noting its popularity as a place of residence. = Pedestrianising the intersection = Before the 1980s, Emerald Hill Road was then linked to the main Orchard Road. In the early 1980s, proposals were put forth to consider the conservation and integrity of the Emerald Hill buildings. http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19801205-1.2.68 This led to the subsequent pedestrianisation of the road in 1981 starting from the intersection at Orchard Road. The overhead gantry of the now defunct Area Licensing Scheme (ALS), was removed with this road closure (the ALS was started in mid-1975 to control the traffic entering the downtown area and has now been replaced by the Electronic Road Pricing (ERP)). On the ground level, the existing tarmac road was replaced with pre-cast concrete paving blocks, and the back lanes tiled. In August 1985, the Urban Redevelopment Authority designated the Emerald Hill site as a conservation area, and with the setting- up cost of $2.2 million, restored 6 two-storey shophouses facing Orchard Road. They renamed the pilot restoration project Peranakan Place.http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_720_2005-01-25.html = The beginnings of Peranakan Place = The URA awarded the tenancy en bloc to a group of individuals on November 28, 1984. The authority said that it decided to lease en bloc the preservation project to ensure that the various aspects of Peranakan culture and the centre's activities would be well coordinated. The group of individuals formed a company named Peranakan Place Complex Pte Ltd hit upon some new and exciting ideas for both Singaporeans and tourists to make Peranakan Place, formerly called Peranakan Corner, an authentic showpiece of Peranakan culture. The renaming of the place was a unanimous decision agreed on by both parties, according to the authority. Peranakan Place was deemed more suitable because it denoted something larger and more established than a mere Corner. Instead of a display centre for cultural activities, the group set up a traditional Baba coffee shop or kedai kopi, complete with laksa, mee-siam and satay stalls, set amid marble-topped tables and aged advertisements of Milo. A coffee shop extension also allowed diners eating outside in an arbour-like alley to enjoy the landscaped Emerald Hill Road with its coconut and banana trees. = The Peranakan Show House = thumb200px House No. 2 Emerald Hill, the front entrance to the Show House back then. In the 1984, Peranakan Place, Singapore's first \\"Peranakan Museum\\" called the Peranakan Place Show House. The show house offered a glimpse of \\"A Day in the Life of a Baba\\" and was styled to resemble a typical Peranakan household. Tours were conducted at the Show House with a tour guide explaining the significance of the decor, the numerous artefacts such as old pieces of porcelain and even the utensils used in the kitchen. The two storey shophouse depicted the traditional Straits Chinese home and included a traditional altar, and rafters with cake baskets and hanging bird cages in the kitchen. On the second storey was a bridal chamber with a huge red and gold lacquer bridal bed, completed with silk curtains, tapestries and silk covered pillows. On the floor is a peep hole over the front door of the house for which the bride could peek at her future husband-to-be. Amongst the artefacts, only the peep hole and a wedding gown remains today on the second storey.http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record- details/05f2c660-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad The museum was later replaced by other developments and the new Peranakan Museum has since found its way to the old Tao Nan School site on Armenian Street and was opened in 2008.  Present day  thumb Five-foot walkway and row of shops along Peranakan Place With its historic colonnaded covered walkways, Peranakan Place is currently an attraction on Orchard Road for tourists and locals alike. It is closed off to traffic, and has commercial spaces as well as food and beverage outlets. Peranakan Place as it stands today is a commercial development that holds businesses ranging from F&B; to retail. As the front faces the main shopping district of Orchard Road, the historic building receives a higher volume of traffic as compared to the quieter housing areas further in on Emerald Hill Road. The owners and tenants are thus required to abide by strict conservation standards set by the URA to ensure that the integrity of the building is preserved. The display of a Chinese Baroque style of architecture, which uses a m√©lange of Chinese and European influences, can still be seen from the colourful yet structured fa√ßade.  Key developments and preservation of architecture  = The Pilot Restoration = In 1985, the URA announced that Emerald Hill would be a conservation area, the first in Singapore, in order to conserve some of the best examples of Straits Chinese style of dwellings. The conservation area also includes the development known as ‚ÄòPeranakan Place‚Äô, which is a row of 6 two-storey shophouses (circa 1902) fronting Orchard Road. This was a pilot restoration and development project carried out by the URA in 1985. https://www.ura.gov.sg/Conservation-Portal/Explore/History?bldgid=EMHL Restored at a cost of $2.2 million in 1985, the original two-storey shophouses that line Peranakan Place date back to as early as 1902. The shophouses had a variety of architectural styles (ranging from Transitional, Late to Art-Deco) and elaborate plaster work and wood carvings combined to create an architectural hybrid that is also referred to as ‚ÄòChinese Baroque‚Äô. During the restoration, the facade and ceramic tile-work were preserved, and features like fluted columns and arches, were rebuilt by the URA. For the first time in any restoration work, the URA had allowed the contractor to use fibreglass reconstructions of original features like motifs, cornices and column capitals to replace those damaged by age. In some cases up to 70 per cent of the original features had been substituted with a material known as poly-marble, which unlike the original bricks and plaster, has an almost unlimited life. During the process of restoration, the interiors of the terrace shophouses were torn down, leaving the exteriors remaining. They were then rebuilt to include more room for business occupants. The tenants included Bibi‚Äôs, a night-spot that offered Peranakan food and theatre entertainment; a museum; and a shop selling Peranakan antiques, cooking utensils, ingredients and cookbooks. = Change of ownership = Peranakan Place Complex Pte Ltd had sold their entire shareholdings to a group of local entrepreneurs with Peranakan heritage 1988. Renovations to Bibi's Restaurant in Peranakan Place started in November 1988 to convert it into a cultural complex for Singapore's artistes to stage plays and perform music. The complex was renovated at a cost of $500,000. The new design included a bar, a stage and some cosy reading rooms with local books and magazines for customers. In the past, the complex was seen as a centre for only traditional Peranakan activities, but the new owners wanted to widen the scope. Known simply as Bibi's, the outlet took on the interior of a rich Peranakan home. Local and western influences were highlighted in the architecture while additional artefacts, fabrics and furnishings complemented the overall design. The coffeeshop, Keday Kopi had been given an overall sprucing up and redesignated as a restaurant called Keday Kopi Peranakan Restaurant. It was officially opened on July 3 with great fanfare complete with lion dances. It boasted a fairly large menu of 50 items, many of which were all-time favourites such as hee-pioh (fish maw) soup, ayam buah keluak and babi pontay. The roofed over alley in Alleybar = The first renovation = In July 1991, Peranakan Place became a fully airconditioned shopping complex. The Orchard Road tourist spot was closed in April 1991 for renovations costing $1.5 million which continued to preserve the Peranakan style facade, and reorganised the interior to feature more shop spaces. Further, the original alley that separated the 180 Orchard Road plot and 2 Emerald Hill plot was roofed and transformed in 1999 to incorporate the food and beverage nightlife spot, Alley Bar, showcasing the unique usage of land space in the highly sought-after conservation area. = The Facade Colours = The colour scheme of the complex has been through many changes over the years, but the owners of the building have always sought to do research on the authenticity of the colours before restoring it to capture the very essence of Baba culture, including their colour sense. In 1985, Peranakan Place was redone in carefully chosen shades of pink, green, and blue - replacing the colours of black and white which were considered as mourning colours by the Peranakan. In 2009, it was a classic grey and white wash with green and pink accents, and in 2015 it was repainted to a bright yellow, emerald, shades of pinks and purple and a bright blue. In 2018, the building was repainted to hues of pastel pink, green and white. Peranakan Place, 2005  Literature on the Emerald Hill area  Aside from the fictional stories written by local Singaporean writers inspired by the area, such as Emily of Emerald Hill by Stella Kon, much has been written about the history and conservation of Emerald Hill and Peranakan Place. These include several of the late academic and conservationist Lee Kip Lin‚Äôs publications.

NAZ Foundation and others is a 2013 case in which a 2 judge Supreme Court bench consisting of G. S. Singhvi and S. J. Mukhopadhaya overturned the Delhi High Court case Naz Foundation v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi and reinstated Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. The Supreme Court of India decided to revisit this judgement after several curative petitions were filed against it, in 2017. Thereby in 2018, Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India, a 5 judge bench of the Supreme Court overturned this judgement, decriminalizing homosexuality. But portions of Section 377 relating to sex with minors, non-consensual sexual acts such as rape, and bestiality remain in force. Decision The judgement of the Supreme Court of India of 11 December 2013 did not find enough reason for portions of section 377 to be declared unconstitutional and overturned the Delhi High Court judgementThe judges stated that \\"a fraction of the country's population constitutes lesbians, gays, bisexuals or transgenders\\" and that the High Court had erroneously relied upon international precedents \\"in its anxiety to protect the so-called rights of LGBT persons\\". On 11 December 2013, the Supreme Court of India set aside the 2009 judgement given by the Delhi High Court stating that judicial intervention was not required in this issue. This in effect recriminalized sexual intercourse \\"against the order of nature\\". In its judgment the Supreme court bench of justices G. S. Singhvi and S. J. Mukhopadhaya stated ‚Äî The both judges however noted that the Parliaments should debate and decide on the matter. A bench of justices upheld the constitutional validity of Section 377 of Indian Penal Code that makes anal sex a punishable offense. Responses Days later and influenced by the Devyani Khobragade incident, former Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha called for the arrest of same-sex companions of US diplomats, citing the Supreme Court of India's recent upholding of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. The recriminalization of gay sex comes under fire from World leaders. The United Nations human rights chief Navi Pillay voiced her disappointment at the re- criminalization of consensual same-sex relationships in India, calling it \\"a significant step backwards\\" for the country. In the wake of Indian Supreme Court's ruling that gay sex is illegal, UN chief Ban Ki-moon stressed on the need for equality and opposed any discrimination against lesbians, gays and bisexuals.India Today Online New Delhi, 12 December 2013  UPDATED 19:05 IST Soon after the judgement, Sonia Gandhi, President of the then ruling Indian National Congress, asked Parliament to do away with section 377. Her son and Congress Party vice-President, Rahul Gandhi also wanted section-377 to go and supported gay rights. In July 2014, Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju in the BJP led Central government told the Lok Sabha in a written reply that a decision regarding Section 377 of IPC can be taken only after pronouncement of judgement by the Supreme Court. However, on 13 January 2015, BJP spokesperson Shaina NC, appearing on NDTV, stated, \\"We [BJP] are for decriminalizing homosexuality. That is the progressive way forward.\\" = Central government = The central government lead by Indian National Congress has filed a review petition on 21 December 2013. In its review petition the Centre said: \\"The judgment suffers from errors apparent on the face of the record, and is contrary to well-established principles of law laid down by the apex Court enunciating the width and ambit of Fundamental Rights under Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution.\\" The IPC, when enacted in 1860, was justified; but with the passage of time it had become arbitrary and unreasonable, the petition added. Naz Foundation has also filed a review petition against the Supreme Court order on Section 377. On 28 January 2014 Supreme Court dismissed the review Petition filed by Central Government, NGO Naz Foundation and several others, against its 11 December verdict on Section 377 of IPC. =Protest on social media= Actor Imran Khan took action in order to disabuse homophobic people from their mistaken notions of homosexuality in a satire video. Many Mumbai film industry personalities such as Amitabh Bachchan, Aamir Khan, Celina Jaitley, Twinkle Khanna, John Abraham, Karan Johar, Farhan Akhtar, Riteish Deshmukh, Shruti Haasan, Sonam Kapoor, Anushka Sharma, commented against the ruling. Many other well known persons, including Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen, and writer Vikram Seth, protested against the supreme court ruling.

The film was produced by Marty Bowen, Wyck Godfrey, Robert Teitel and Tillman Jr., and stars Amandla Stenberg, Regina Hall, Russell Hornsby, KJ Apa, Common, and Anthony Mackie, and follows the fallout after a high school student witnesses a police shooting. The project was announced on March 23, 2016, and casting took place during August and September 2017. Principal photography began on September 12, 2017 in Atlanta, Georgia. On February 5, 2018, it was announced that Kian Lawley's role was recast after a video of him using racially offensive slurs resurfaced. A month later, it was announced that Lawley had been replaced by Apa. The Hate U Give premiered at the 2018 Toronto International Film Festival on September 7, 2018, and was released in the United States on October 5, 2018. The film received critical acclaim, with many praising Stenberg's performance, Wells' screenplay and Tillman Jr.'s direction. Nevertheless, it was a box office bomb, grossing over $34 million worldwide against its $23 million budget. Stenberg was nominated for and won numerous accolades, including winning the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture and being nominated for a Critics' Choice Award. Plot Starr Carter is a 16-year-old American girl who lives in the predominantly black neighborhood of Garden Heights, but attends a predominantly white private school Williamson Prep. After a gun goes off at a party Starr is attending, Starr is driven home by her childhood best friend, Khalil. While driving home, they are stopped by a police officer for failing to signal a lane change. The officer barks orders at Khalil, such as to roll down the window and turn off the music. Khalil disagrees with the officer, who instructs him to exit the car. While outside the car, the officer retrieves Khalil's drivers license and instructs him to keep his hands on the roof while the officer checks his ID. Khalil leans down into the car window to check on Starr, before reaching through the driver-side to pick up a hairbrush. The officer shoots and kills Khalil. As Starr mourns over Khalil, the officer realizes that he was holding a hairbrush, not a gun. Khalil's killing becomes a national news story. Starr's identity as the witness is initially kept secret from everyone outside Starr's familyleaving Starr's two best friends, Hailey Grant and Maya Yang, and Starr's boyfriend, Chris, who all attend Williamson Prep together, unaware of Starr's connection to the killing. Having to keep this secret weighs on Starr, as does her need to keep her Williamson and Garden Heights personas separate. Starr agrees to be interviewed on television and to testify in front of a grand jury after being encouraged by a civil rights lawyer, April Ofrah. While defending Khalil's character during her interview, in which her identity is hidden, she names the King Lords, the gang that controls her neighborhood. The gang retaliates by threatening Starr and her family, forcing them to move in with her Uncle Carlos, her mom's brother, who is a police detective. Carlos was a father figure to Starr when her father, Maverick, spent three years in prison for a crime he did not commit. Following his release, Maverick left the gang and became the owner of the Garden Heights grocery store where Starr and her half-brother Seven work. Maverick was only allowed to leave the King Lords because his false confession to a crime kept gang leader King from being locked up. King, widely feared in the neighborhood, now lives with Seven's mother and Seven's half-sister Kenya, who is friends with Starr. After a grand jury does not indict the officer, Garden Heights erupts into both peaceful protests and riots. In reaction to the decision, Starr takes an increasingly public role, including speaking out during the protests, which are met by police in riot gear. Her increasing identification with the people of Garden Heights causes tension with Starr's school friends, and especially with her boyfriend Chris. Starr and Maya eventually start standing up to Hailey's racist comments, and Chris remains supportive of Starr. Starr and Seven get trapped in Maverick's grocery store, which is fire-bombed by King and his gang. The two escape with the help of Maverick and some other Garden Heights business owners. When the police arrive, Starr's younger brother Sekani points a gun at King. Starr defuses the situation. The community stands up against King, who goes to jail. Starr eventually promises to keep Khalil's memory alive, and to continue her advocacy against police violence by \\"any means necessary.\\"  Cast  * Amandla Stenberg as Starr Carter * Regina Hall as Lisa Carter, Starr's & Sekani's mother and Maverick's wife * Russell Hornsby as Maverick Carter, Starr, Sekani & Seven's father * Algee Smith as Khalil Harris, Starr's childhood best friend * Lamar Johnson as Seven Carter, Starr, Sekani, and Kenya's older half-brother * Issa Rae as April Ofrah * K.

Stenberg nails every nuance of a role that keeps throwing challenges at her, none more devastating than when it becomes impossible for Starr to remain stuck in neutral.\\" Keith Watson of Slant Magazine gave the film two out of four stars, writing, \\"Given its intensely relevant subject matter, the film can't help but churn up a lot of raw emotions‚Äîand the allusions to Michael Brown, Sandra Bland, and Emmett Till are reminders of the real-life sorrow that birthed this film‚Äîbut Tillman's anonymous direction is content merely to illustrate the screenplay without ever bringing it to life. Even scenes that are meant to be tinged with menace and danger‚Äîrun-ins with a local gang, a shooting at a party‚Äîfeel about as raw as an episode of Degrassi.\\" Scott Mendelson, writing for Forbes, stated that the film deserved to be an Academy Awards frontrunner for its screenplay, Stenberg and Russell Hornsby's performances, and the picture itself, saying it \\"belongs among the final list of would-be Best Picture nominees.\\" See also * List of black films of the 2010s * List of hood films *Police brutality  References   External links  * * Category:2018 films Category:2010s teen drama films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:American films Category:American teen drama films Category:Films about activists Category:Films about racism Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films based on young adult literature Category:Films directed by George Tillman Jr. Category:Films set in Atlanta Category:Films shot in Atlanta Category:Hood films Category:Films with screenplays by Audrey Wells Category:Temple Hill Entertainment films Category:2018 drama films Category:Films scored by Dustin O'Halloran ","title":"The Hate U Give (film)"},{"id":"55023299","title":"There Is No Love in Fluorescent Light"},{"id":"55023318","text":"Datuk Seri Ramlan bin Ibrahim (born 6 January 1957) is a current member of the Election Commission of Malaysia and a former Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Malaysia.

The following year, Ramlan was appointed as Deputy High Commissioner to Singapore. His first posting as Ambassador was to Bosnia Herzegovina, in 2004. When he returned to the Ministry in 2006, he was appointed as the Undersecretary of the Americas Division, before becoming Undersecretary of South East Asia Division in quick succession. In 2009, Ramlan was again appointed Ambassador of Malaysia - this time to the Republic of Korea. His return from Korea in 2013 saw him heading the Bilateral Department, the second-highest post in the Malaysian foreign service. His services were needed elsewhere however, and in April 2015, Ramlan was appointed as Malaysia's Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York. Malaysia was at the time a member of the Security Council, thus Ramlan was also Malaysia's Permanent Representative in the Council, the highest decision-making organ of the United Nations. Malaysia became President of the Security Council twice, in April 2015 and August 2016. As Ambassador, Ramlan presided over those meetings, only relinquishing the responsibility when the Deputy Prime Minister or Foreign Minister was in New York for the session. =At the UNSC= Ramlan's first task upon taking up the post in New York in April 2015 was to preside over the much-vaunted UN Security Council. In fact, Ramlan's arrival to New York as Permanent Representative of Malaysia to the United Nations coincided with Malaysia's first tenure as President of the Security Council, in April 2015. At the Security Council, Ramlan was also Chair of the Security Council's Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict, and held open debates on the subject on 18 June 2015 and 2 August 2016. UN Resolution 2225 on 'children and armed conflict' was adopted with a unanimous vote during Malaysia's Chairmanship in 2015. In the closing days of the Malaysia's tenure at the UN Security Council in December 2016, a draft resolution on the issue of Palestine was circulated. The draft condemned the illegal Israeli settlement in the Occupied Territories, and was tabled by Egypt, on behalf of other co-sponsors. When Egypt found itself \\"under immense pressure\\", Malaysia stepped in to ensure that the draft resolution was not derailed. Other co-sponsors - Senegal, Venezuela, and New Zealand - remained steadfast and the draft resolution was finally put to a vote on 23 December 2016. In a historic decision not seen in nearly 36 years, the UN Security Council managed to adopt the resolution (now known as United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 with a vote of 14 in favour and one abstention (the United States). The adoption of Resolution 2334 is seen as a victory for Malaysia, and particularly for Ramlan, who with the blessing of the Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak and Minister Anifah Aman, was able to canvas support for a non-veto resolution. =As MFA Secretary General= Ramlan was appointed as Secretary General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 1 January 2017 and received his letter of appointment from the Chief Secretary to the Government, Tan Sri Dr Ali Hamsa. Barely two months into his stewardship, Malaysia was plunged into a standoff with North Korea over the death of a North Korean citizen, rumored to be none other than Kim Jong-nam, the estranged brother of Kim Jong-il. Ramlan's skills a diplomat- negotiator, honed during Malaysia's tenure at the UN Security Council became invaluable and he was tasked with spearheading the negotiations to free the 11 Malaysians held captive by the Pyongyang regime. Ramlan became the first top management officer at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Malaysia to establish his own Twitter account in line with his own vision of making the service more transparent and social media-friendly. He continues to remould the Ministry, introducing innovative advances to Malaysia's foreign service and encouraging ideas that will bring the Ministry into the digital age.

SEM is often deployed via programs that target the businesses or other organizations within a utility territory or a government area. SEM is codified in the ISO 50001 standard for energy management systems.  Energy benefits  The main goal of SEM is to help a company achieve continuous improvement in its energy performance over a longer-term period. Some energy benefits of SEM include reduced energy consumption through improved energy efficiency and energy conservation, improved peak demand management and reduced demand charges, decreased overall energy cost, reduced energy costs, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and improved reliability through integration of distributed energy resources (e.g. onsite renewables, localized energy storage, combined heat and power), and improved electrical price stability and reduced GHG emissions through integration of long-term renewable energy contracts.  Non-energy benefits  Although often focused on energy management, SEM also supports other goals, including: reducing downtime and increasing productivity through improved maintenance practices, reducing CO2 and other air emissions through reduced on-site fuel combustion (through efficiency or through beneficial electrification), and improved employee productivity through increased employee morale.  Core elements  Most companies take several years to develop all the elements of SEM. The core or minimum elements of SEM for achieving the goal and benefits just described includeConsortium for Energy Efficiency, ‚ÄúCEE Strategic Energy Management Minimum Elements,‚Äù https://library.cee1.org/content/cee-strategic- energy-management-minimum-elements/ management commitment to long-term energy performance goals, energy planning and implementation, and system for measuring and reporting energy performance.  Current activities  SEM Collaboratives Regional SEM collaboratives have met in the Northwestern and Northeastern United States for several years, with interest expressed in other regions for similar collaborative forums. The first North American SEM Summit was conducted in Denver Colorado on August 15, 2017, with representatives from across the United States and Canada.  Common services  While organizations can implement SEM on their own, many have found value in leveraging SEM specialists or SEM-based programs. =Private companies= Private companies provide SEM-based services to their customers as a dedicated consulting engagement. Other companies integrate SEM concepts into their more traditional energy engineering, energy planning, or energy project implementations. =Energy utilities= Energy utilities in the U.S. and Canada often deploy dedicated SEM programs or deploy SEM components within other programs. These utilities deploy SEM for multiple reasons increased energy savings to support utility Demand Side Management (DSM) goals, measured in electrical, gas, or other energy savings, increased customer motivation to pursue energy saving opportunities (with less required utility outreach/marketing), reduced peak demand to address constraints in generation and/or transmission/distribution, and increased long-term customer satisfaction The target customers for these programs are typically larger organizations, often manufacturers or larger building environments such as hospitals, water utilities, and universities. Some utility SEM programs work with customers on an individual basis, and some provide training and coaching to groups of companies, often referred to as cohorts. The cohort approach tends to be more cost-effective for the utility, since at least some of the coach/trainer‚Äôs time can serve several customers at once. In addition, the cohort can provide positive peer pressure for participants to take action and save more energy. =Government agencies= Government agencies around the world often deploy SEM programs to drive adoption of ISO 50001, to increase competitiveness of the businesses within their borders, and/or to address climate priorities.  ISO 50001  ISO 50001 codifies SEM by establishing universal requirements for management systems for energy (EnMSs). ISO 50001 is aligned to other management system standards for quality and environmental impact. It includes requirements for management participation, objectives, monitoring and measurement, and several other elements.

Plot In Kyiv at the beginning of the 20th century, a frivolous barber named Svyryd Petrovych Holokhvostyi (Oleg Borisov) goes bankrupt and is forced to close his shop. Upon learning that a Mr. Sirko (Mykola Yakovenko) is offering a dowry of ten thousand roubles for his unrefined and unattractive daughter, Pronia (Margarita Krinitsyna), Svyryd decides to pay his debts by marrying her. Svyryd dupes a German creditor of his to finance the courtship. While showing off his new suit to friends in the park on Saint Vladimir Hill, he sees and briefly flirts with the beautiful Halia (Natalia Naum) before being chased away by her would be boyfriend, Stepan. That evening, Svyryd takes Pronia to the movies on a date and afterwards makes a false confession of love to her. She invites him to her house to propose. Later that night, while drinking with his friends, Svyryd boasts about his successful date with Pronia; and that once he gets the money, he will start an affair with a beauty. Svyryd meets Halia in an alley, falsely confesses his love to her, claims to be a rich suitor, and forces her into an embrace. Halia's mother, Sekleta Limerikha (Nonna Koperzhinskaya), happens by and stops it. Sekleta threatens him and makes him swear on the steps of Saint Andrew's Church to marry Halia whose heart actually belongs to Stepan. The next day, Sekleta, sister to Mrs. Sirko, lets herself into her sister's home where she insults them and is summarily thrown out. Svyryd narrowly misses Sekleta as he arrives to propose and receive the Sirkos' blessing for marriage with Pronia. Some time later, he runs into Sekleta who forces him to share an open carriage to her house where guests soon arrive to celebrate Sekleta's name day. During the celebration, Svyryd flirts with Sister Mironia, a pretty nun, and gets her to drink. As the party winds down, Sekleta announces the engagement of Halia and Svyryd. As she happens to be passing by her sister's house, Mrs. Sirko tries to partake in the festivities, but is stopped by Pronia who is embarrassed by such a lowbrow party. Sekleta laments that none of her relatives stopped by to visit on the special occasion which leads Svyryd to realize that Pronia and Halia are cousins! Halia runs from the gathering to her beloved Stepan who informs her that Svyryd is a fraud. On the wedding day, curious friends of Sekleta discover Pronia is marrying Svyryd. A black cat crosses Svyryd's path on his way to Pronia's door, and he immediately trips and falls into the dirt, soiling and tearing his wedding attire. Sekleta's friends race to inform her before the wedding can take place. Sekleta halts the wedding party on the steps of Saint Andrew's Church and announces to everyone that Svyryd is in fact engaged to Halia. Pronia collapses upon realizing what has happened. As Svyryd tries to walk away, Sekleta stops him and demands that he now marry Halia; however, creditors and bill collectors suddenly appear with proof that Svyryd is bankrupt who then leaves the scene with his friends.

It was built in 2013 in Russian church architecture style. History In 1854, a five-domed Odigitrievsky Church was built in Bataysk, with the height that is comparable to those of the modern Rostov Cathedral. On the church yard there were two schools, an almshouse, and a refectory. In 1937 this church was destroyed. In the pre-war years, the remains of the church building served as a prison. During the Great Patriotic War, when Bataysk was occupied by Nazi forces, a camp for prisoners of war that was surrounded by barbed wire was established at the site of the destroyed church. After the war, a lyceum was built on the foundation of the church, and in the late 1980s, when the Perestroika began in the USSR, town residents decided to build a new church on the former church territory. Residents of Bataysk appealed to the town authorities with a request to hand them over the cinema theatre building to open an Orthodox church in it. The request was approved. In 1991 the church's revival began, and it was named in honour of the Holy Trinity. One of its altars received the name \\"Odigitrievsky\\". Construction of the Holy Trinity Church began in September 2000. In 2003, two domes with crosses and a tower clock on the bell tower were installed. On the square, in front of the church, there was also constructed a monument to St. Andrew the First-Called, the opening and consecration of which were held on September 27, 2003. The author of the monument is the Honoured Artist of the Russian Federation, sculptor S. M. Isakov. The monument was installed at the expense of the Charity Fund of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker. The ceremony of its consecration was headed by Archbishop Panteleimon of Rostov and Novocherkassk. In 2006, the construction of a new building for the church school began. In 2008, walls and arches were plastered, and fence was arranged. In 2009, finishing works inside were carried out. The Trinity Church was completed in 2013 and became a major landmark of Bataysk. At the architectural competition-show \\"Prometheus-2007\\" which was held in Stavropol, the church was recognized as the most beautiful religious building of Southern Russia.

In 2010, the museum closed doors to do another rehabilitation, which ended in 2015.  Exhibition  The Terracotta Museum has a collection of up to 11,000 pieces, including about 3,000 from all over the Iberian Peninsula and ceded by the Generalitat de Catalunya. The exhibition has four thematic axes about ceramics, pre industrial ceramics, industrial development and a tribute to its creators. You can also visit the old furnaces and chimneys of the Terracotta factory. = Areas = * Ceramics: The development of the ceramics industry depends to a large extent on the environmental conditions of the area where this activity is carried out. The massif of Les Gavarres is the natural area that traditionally has provided La Bisbal raw materials and, after all, has made the development of its industry possible. Ceramic objects, both glazed and tile, are, in all their simplicity and everyday life, one of the human manifestations that best explain the changes and historical evolution. They appear in all civilizations and in all historical times. * Pre-industrial ceramics: Tile and pottery are two handicraft activities related to a rural, agrarian and subsistence economy model. The pieces of railing are made by hand, following an identical work process in which only the mold of wood is changed that must form. La Bisbal pottery is characterized by being baked, cooked only once in wood furnaces and with three main types of finish: the Rustic or matte, smoked and glazed or glazed. * Industrial ceramics: The use of machines in the ceramic industry revolutionized the traditional production system, and caused that some typical tasks of the potter, which often represented a considerable investment of time and effort, were made in a matter of minutes by a machine. It's important to point out that the industrialization of ceramics does not occur suddenly but gradually. * Creators: At the beginning of the 20th century, and beyond the modernism, some specialized artisans and artists promoted the field of artistic ceramics thanks to an intensa activity, that meant the first recognition of the aesthetic and decorative values of the ceramics. In 1940, the decline in traditional pottery production worsens, as well as, increases the consolidation of a major cultural, economic and social change towards a much more urban and industrial model of society. Nevertheless, the tourism boom avoided a situation of disruption of the ceramics industry. From then until today, the artisan ceramics will experience a gradual transformation, varying traditional uses depending on the aesthetic demands of this new public and adapting their designs and colors to the tastes of the new consumers. = Featured objects = * Land: Land is the basic material that potters use for the manufacture of objects. It, mixed with water, becomes a plastic mass that can be molded, which preserves the shape given after drying and, once cooked, acquires great hardness. * Pot: The ceramics industry appears in all civilizations and at all times. The obvious formal similarity that is seen between objects of very different historical periods and between different cultures, demonstrates the universality and durability of some basic typologies, especially those related to food. * Measure of wine: * Modernist pitcher: Throughout the early 20th century, the traditional Bisbal pottery industry gradually entered into a crisis, affected by the structural change that implied the progressive transformation of a rural society to an urban future. This situation, however, has stimulate the appearance of other alternative manufactures, such as the decorative ceramics.

While working as a surveyor in the Great Trigonometrical Survey he rediscovered what became the Kolar Gold Fields and in later life he documented Indian astronomy and time-keeping in his book Kala Sankalita.  Biography  1812 experiments with pendulums Warren was born at Livorno, Italy, the fourth child of Count Henry Hyacinthe de Warren and Christine Walburge de Meuerers. Their ancestors included Guillaume de Warren, first count of Warren and Surrey. He moved to London in 1793 and tried to work as an artist but failed. He then moved to Calcutta on 10 December 1793 and attempted to become an indigo planter but failed. He bought commission as an ensign in the army and fought in Mysore under Arthur Wellesley against Tipu Sultan. After the victory against Tipu, and in view of his \\"addiction to mathematical studies\\" he was appointed to assist the Mysore Survey under William Lambton. He conducted additional experiments during Lambton's initial baseline trials in Bangalore to examine the effects of refraction on measurements. He also examined the effects of humidity by constructing a hygrometer that made use of the beards of a local grass called Panimooloo Heteropogon contortus. While surveying the region near Malur, Warren heard about gold deposits and examined the old mines in the Kolar region that had been abandoned as being too low in yield. He was a proponent for the use of milestones and he put in 262 markers at his own expense between Srirangapatnam and Naickenchero and between Bangalore and Balamangalam. Warren held the post of Company Astronomer and was a superintendent of the surveying school at Madras. During his term at the surveying school he was charged of embezzling money and was forced to return an excess of 3860 pagodas (100 pagodas per year per student was the norm but Warren was drawing 1200 per year) due to complaints from a student. Warren was acting director at the Madras Observatory from February 1805 to October 1811 and in this period he established the longitude of Madras, a figure that was used in the trigonometrical survey and for nearly a century. In 1812 he published the results of measurements of the periods of pendulums and compared them with measurements from other parts of the world and came to the conclusion that the departure from predicted values was due to heterogeneity in the geology of the Earth.In 1814 he returned to France with his son Edouard. He was reinstated into the French army with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel and was made Chevalier of St Louis. He became a corresponding member of the 'le Bureau des Longitudes'. Leaving his son to study in France, he returned to settle in Pondicherry and work on a book on the methods of timekeeping and calendar making in southern India. The book, Kala Sankalita, begun in 1814 was finally published in 1825. Among the calculations that Warren documented was the computation of lunar eclipses by a Pondicherry-based calendar maker who used shells placed on the ground and coded formulae. In 1824 he was made Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. Warren died in Pondicherry on 9 February 1830 and a book on his life was written by his son Edouard - L'Inde Anglaise en 1843.

After working in various managerial roles, Torobayev was elected as a deputy for the Supreme Council of Kyrgyzstan in the 2007 parliamentary election, joining Kurmanbek Bakiyev's Ak Zhol party. After the 2010 Kyrgyz revolution, when Bakiyev was overthrown, he joined the Respublika Party of Kyrgyzstan, but clashed with party leader Omurbek Babanov, leading him to join Onuguu-Progress. Torobayev was also an official candidate for the 2017 presidential election in Kyrgyzstan, until he withdrew nine days before the start of the election. Early life, education and managerial career Torobayev was born on 5 April 1973 in the city of Jalal-Abad, in south-west Kyrgyzstan (then the Soviet republic of the Kirgiz SSR). He started work in 1995 as a director of Zhamlia i K, a Kazakhstan-based production and commercial company, specialising in the sale of petroleum products and the construction of filling stations. Between 1998 and 1999, he worked on a farm named \\"Asia-Suzak\\" as its chairman. He also, in 1999, graduated from the economics faculty of the Kyrgyz State National University with a degree in finance and credit. Between 2000 and 2009, he worked as the CEO of Mariam, a flour factory. Political career Torobayev entered the Supreme Council after the 2007 parliamentary election, as a member of Kurmanbek Bakiyev's Ak Zhol party. From 15 December 2009 to 2010 he was the Minister of Emergency Situations, which included the period of the 2010 Kyrgyz revolution. After the overthrow of Bakiyev, Torobayev joined the Respublika Party of Kyrgyzstan, led by Omurbek Babanov. However, Torobayev and Babanov frequently clashed in the party, which led to Torobayev leaving Respublika and founding Onuguu‚ÄìProgress. In 2016, Torobayev stood as a candidate for speaker of the Supreme Council, along with Kanat Isayev of the Kyrgyzstan Party. Both failed to receive the required 61 votes to become speaker, as Isayev and Torobayev received 51 votes each. =Onuguu‚ÄìProgress= Originally a political movement, Onuguu‚ÄìProgress held its first congress on 1 February 2012, and it was formally registered as a party sixteen days later. At its second congress, on 23 April 2015, it elected Torobayev as its leader. The party first stood candidates in the 2015 parliamentary election, winning 13 of the 120 seats in the Supreme Council, coming fourth. As leader of the party, Torobayev supports the strengthening of Kyrgyzstan's parliamentary democracy and transfer of more powers from the office of the president to the office of the prime minister, while at the same time stating that \\"[continued discussion of whether to have a presidential or parliamentary system has] really tired people with [such] business.\\" He has placed himself and the party under a \\"centrist\\" and \\"neoconservative\\" label, supporting property rights, a market economy and more political competition. =Presidential campaign= On 10 February 2017, Torobayev confirmed that he was running in the 2017 presidential elections; on 27 June delegates from his own party unanimously confirmed that he was running under the Onuguu‚ÄìProgress name. After his confirmation, he tried twice to broker deals with other parties and politicians; the first in August when Torobayev announced that Onuguu‚ÄìProgress would merge with two other parties, Mekenim-Kyrgyzstan and Respublika‚ÄìAta Zhurt, in an attempt to receive a better electoral vote, and to allow all three party leaders a government post if their candidate were to be elected president. On 4 September he announced that a conference would be held a week later to formally announce the presidential candidate of the new party, named as \\"Kaira Zharaluy\\", but the merger failed, as Respubika‚ÄìAta Zhurt chairman Kamchybek Tashiyev decided to support the Social Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan for the elections. Six days later Torobayev joined up with Omurbek Babanov, agreeing that should Babanov win, he would become prime minister. Initially one of the thirteen registered candidates, Torobayev eventually withdrew from the race on 6 October. Torobayev's campaign was based upon the creation of a \\"dictatorship of law\\", where he would promote creation of jobs, especially for young people, and making sure that citizens feel \\"legally and socially\\" protected, an attempt to appeal to the city-dwelling entrepreneurial class and also to the burgeoning traditionalist electorate. He did not take up his 15-minute airtime slot on OTRK, Kyrgyzstan's national broadcaster, after the station accused his supporters of bribing voters. =Post-election= From the fallout of Babanov failing to secure the presidency, three deputies from his party attempted to launch a leadership challenge against Torobayev; an internal vote subsequently expelled them from the party, and the newspaper Vecherny Bishkek, described by analysis site EurasiaNet as a 'privately owned government mouthpiece', made comments about how Torobayev may \\"lose control [...] over the Onuguu-Progress faction\\". Personal life Torobayev is married with five children. He has two brothers, Askarali, who works as deputy chairman for the State Service for Combating Economic Crimes, and Batyr, who heads the association of millers at the Union of Entrepreneurs of the Republic.

It was the 16th January 4 Tokyo Dome Show and the first held under the new \\"Wrestle Kingdom\\" name. Wrestle Kingdom is traditionally NJPW's biggest event of the year and has been described as their equivalent to WWE's WrestleMania. The show marked the 35th anniversary celebration for NJPW, who teamed up with one-time rival promotion AJPW to produce the show. Headlined by two title matches, contested for NJPW's top title, the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, and AJPW's top title, the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship, as well as the reunion of Keiji Mutoh and Masahiro Chono, all in all, the event featured nine matches. Production =Background= When New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) held the 2006 January 4 Tokyo Dome Show, Toukon Shidou Chapter 1, some saw it as a possible \\"end of an era\\". In recent years, the January 4 show, held annually since 1992, had been suffering from a drop in both interest and attendance and while the 2006 show drew 31,000 fans to the Tokyo Dome, only around 10,000 of them paid for their ticket. The show, however, was still considered a success due to high merchandise sales, allowing NJPW to keep the tradition alive for another year. NJPW had previously had success promoting interpromotional shows with All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), and decided to partner with them again for the 2007 Tokyo Dome show in an effort to boost attendance numbers. The partnership was officially announced in a press conference on November 15, 2006. AJPW had recently partnered with Yuke's, the owners of NJPW, for the video game Wrestle Kingdom. As a result, the 2007 January 4 Tokyo Dome show was dubbed \\"Wrestle Kingdom in Tokyo Dome\\". The name stuck and the annual January 4 Tokyo Dome show has been known as Wrestle Kingdom ever since. Keiji Mutoh, who was part of the \\"Super Dream Tag Match\\" The main event of the show was booked as a tribute to Shinya Hashimoto, who had died from cerebral hemorrhage on July 11, 2005. In the match, Hashimoto's Three Musketeers partners Keiji Mutoh and Masahiro Chono would take on Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Satoshi Kojima. Both teams had actually disbanded years earlier due to Mutoh and Kojima having jumped from NJPW to AJPW at the start of 2002, but Kojima and Tenzan had recently reunited for AJPW's 2006 Real World Tag League. Mutoh was said to have been negative towards the idea of turning the match into a Hashimoto tribute, but was convinced to go along with it on the day of the show. =Storylines= Wrestle Kingdom featured professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The main theme of the show was interpromotional matches between wrestlers from AJPW and NJPW. The show included two world title matches, contested for AJPW's Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship and NJPW's IWGP Heavyweight Championship with both being interpromotional matches. The Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship featured champion Minoru Suzuki taking on challenger Yuji Nagata. The two were seniors in 1986, when Suzuki beat Nagata twice in amateur wrestling, first in a Tokyo high school tournament and again at the Japanese sectionals. In the IWGP title match, NJPW's Hiroshi Tanahashi was set to defend against AJPW's Taiy≈ç Kea. Event Masahiro Chono, also part of the \\"Super Dream Tag Match\\" NJPW billed the show as having a \\"double main event\\", followed by a \\"Super Dream Tag Match\\" as the last match of the night. In the first of the \\"main events\\", Minoru Suzuki made his second successful defense of the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship against longtime rival Yuji Nagata. In the second main event, Hiroshi Tanahashi made his third successful defense of the IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Taiy≈ç Kea. The final match of the show featured AJPW's Keiji Mutoh and NJPW's Masahiro Chono, two thirds of the Three Musketeers, reuniting as a tag team for the first time in eight years and nine months. They defeated Tencozy, a tag team made up of NJPW wrestler Hiroyoshi Tenzan and AJPW wrestler Satoshi Kojima. After the match, Mutoh and Chono paid tribute to the third Musketeer, the late Shinya Hashimoto, with Hashimoto's \\"Bakush≈ç Sengen\\" theme song playing to end the show. Another top match saw freelancer Toshiaki Kawada defeat NJPW's up-and-coming star Shinsuke Nakamura. Katsuhiko Nagata made an appearance at the show, greeting the fans in attendance. Reception Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter wrote that with Wrestle Kingdom, the end of NJPW's annual January 4 Tokyo Dome Show was \\"more likely than ever\\". While NJPW announced an attendance number of 28,000, Meltzer claimed that there were actually only 18,000 fans in attendance with \\"just over 10,000 paid\\".

St Mary's Church dates from the 12th century, and is a Grade II* listed building.  History  Little Washbourne was first mentioned in a copy of a document dated to 780, in the form Uassanburnan. The name is from the Old English w√¶sse (genitive w√¶ssan), meaning \\"swamp\\", and burna, meaning \\"stream\\", and so means \\"stream with land subject to flooding\\". \\"Little\\" was added much later (first recorded in the 17th century), to distinguish the place from Great Washbourne. In 780 Offa, King of Mercia, gave land there to the monks of Worcester, and as a result the manor became a detached part of Worcestershire, separated from the rest of the county by Great Washbourne in Gloucestershire. It formed a hamlet of the Worcestershire parish of Overbury. In the 13th century the manor was held by a family who took the name Washbourne, from the place. In 1844 Little Washbourne was transferred to Gloucestershire under the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844. It became a civil parish in 1866, but in 1935 the civil parish was abolished and merged into the parish of Dumbleton.Vision of Britain website  References   External links  Category:Villages in Gloucestershire Category:Former civil parishes in Gloucestershire ","title":"Little Washbourne"},{"id":"55024366","text":"Sterculia stigmarota is a plant, belonging to the genus Sterculia and the family Malvaceae (previously the Sterculiaceae, now relegated to a subfamily).

PicSat was designed and built by a small team of scientists and engineers led by Dr. Sylvestre Lacour, astrophysicist and instrumentalist at the High Angular Resolution in Astrophysics group of the LESIA laboratory at the Paris Observatory / PSL Research University / CNRS. The satellite was launched on January 12, 2018. It operated for more than 10 weeks, then fell silent on March 20, 2018. The Beta-Pictoris Star System With an age of about 23 million years, Beta Pictoris is a very young star, astronomically speaking. Compared to the Sun, which is halfway through its adult life at 4.5 billion years, Beta Pictoris is about twice the mass and twice the size. Beta Pictoris is relatively close to the Sun, just 63.4 light years away, which means it is bright and easy to observe. This makes Beta Pictoris interesting for study as it allows astronomers to learn more about the very early stages of planet formation. In the early 1980s a large disk of debris of asteroids, dust and gas was found surround Beta Pictoris, leftover from the formation of the star. In 2009 a giant gas planet was discovered by a team of French astronomers led by Anne-Marie Lagrange from Grenoble, France. The planet, named Beta Pictoris b, is about seven times as massive as Jupiter, the largest planet in the Solar System. It orbits the star at some ten Astronomical Units (AU), which is ten times the distance between the Earth and the Sun and the same distance as planet Saturn orbits the Sun. A possible transit of Beta- Pictoris b or its Hill Sphere In 2016 there were predictions published that the Beta Pictoris b Hill Sphere (or gravitational sphere of influence), or perhaps the planet itself, would be passing in front of its star as seen from the Earth. The detailed observation of such a phenomenon would allow learning more about the young planet. For example, if the planet itself were to transit and we would be able to observe this transit, then its exact size and the extension and composition of its atmosphere could be derived. Knowledge of the size of the planet, in combination with its mass, leads to its density. The density is directly related to the chemical composition: a lower density means more gaseous material, a higher density more rocky material. Because the planet Beta Pictoris b is so young, knowing these parameters gives more insight into the formation of giant planets and planetary systems in general. However, the moment of transit can only be estimated roughly, because the orbit of Beta Pictoris b is not that well known. The transit has been predicted to occur between the summer of 2017 and the summer of 2018. A transit of the planet would only last for up to a few hours. A transit of the Hill Sphere can last anywhere from days to months. In order to capture the phenomenon, continuous accurate monitoring of the star system from Space is the only possible way. It cannot be done from Earth, because on the one hand professional observatories are in high demand and cannot be used for long term continuous monitoring, and on the other hand even smaller observatories and high level amateurs all suffer from the same problem: the Earth's varying atmospheric conditions and day-night cycle. Even the most tenuous cloud passing in front of a telescope could be misinterpreted as a transit phenomenon. However, observations are being done non-continuously using Earth- based observatories. At the time of writing, no signs of any transit have yet been detected from these observations. During a transit the amount of the light that reaches us from the star is slightly diminished while the planet is blocking out a small part of it. This little dip in the star's brightness is the signature of the transit and can be captured by a sensitive instrument, a photometer, that accurately measures the light from the star collected by a telescope. The main goal of PicSat is exactly that: To observe the brightness of the star Beta Pictoris continuously, so as to capture the small dip in that light as the planet Beta Pictoris b or its Hill Sphere passes in front of it. The PicSat Project PicSat, a contraction of \\"Beta Pictoris\\" and \\"Satellite\\", is a so-called CubeSat. PicSat is composed of three standard cubic units, called a \\"3U\\", each 10x10x10cm in size. PicSat is the very first CubeSat to be operated by the CNRS. It is different from most CubeSat projects in that it has been developed by professionals, not by students. The project started in 2014 when Sylvestre Lacour, astrophysicist and instrumentalist at the French CNRS at the LESIA laboratory / Paris Observatory, got the idea to use a CubeSat to observe the predicted transit of planet Beta-Pictoris b. He gathered a small local team and together they designed and built PicSat. PicSat is one of the few CubeSats worldwide with an astrophysical science goal, and the first CubeSat in the challenging field of exoplanetary science. The PicSat science case has been defined in collaboration with Dr. Alain Lecavelier des Etangs, from the Institut d‚ÄôAstrophysique de Paris, who has been working on the Beta Pictoris system for many years. The PicSat project also results from the fruitful collaboration with CCERES, the space \\"Center & Campus\\" of PSL Research University, and with French Space Agency CNES experts. PicSat was launched into Low Earth Orbit (505 km altitude) on 12 January 2018 by the Indian ISRO PSLV C40 mission. PicSat Techspecs PicSat consists of three cubic units. The top and middle cubic units hold the satellite's payload, the bottom unit contains the onboard computer. The top cubic unit of PicSat contains a small telescope, with a five centimeter diameter mirror. Due to the fact that Beta Pictoris is such a bright star, this small mirror size is sufficient to collect enough light from the star. There are two important innovative technical aspects for PicSat. The first is the innovative way the satellite will fine track the star, the second is the use of an optical fibre in space to direct the light from the star into the photodiode. In the middle cubic unit a tiny optical fibre, three micrometer in diameter, about a fifth the size of a thin human hair, collects the light from the star. Used frequently at Earth based observatories, it will be the first time an optical fibre is flown in space for astronomical observations. Thus the telescope system in the top unit sends the light of the star onto its focal plane at the bottom of the unit and into the fibre. The tiny fibre guides the light into a sensitive photodiode in the middle unit that accurately measures the arrival time of each photon individually. The idea of using an optical fibre is that due to its small size, it eliminates all disturbing light sources from entering the photodiode, and thus allows for a very accurate measurement of the star's brightness. These are for example stray light from the sky and scattered light within the optical system. However, the standard pointing accuracy of a CubeSat is not sufficient to allow the telescope to send the light from the star exactly into the small opening of the fibre all the time. The telescope will wiggle and wobble too much as it orbits the Earth. The PicSat team devised an innovative solution for this problem by connecting the optical fibre to a small plate, a so-called piezoelectric actuator, that can move very fast. By moving the fibre very fast around the star, it can track where the star is drifting off to, and then immediate follow it, so as to remain on target. The bottom cubic unit of PicSat contains the onboard computer for the operation of the satellite, communication with Earth, batteries, raw pointing of the telescope and other important monitoring tasks. The whole satellite is clothed in arrays of solar panels that deploy once in Space. They provide with energy for the operation of all the systems. The total weight of PicSat is about 3.5 kg and the power consumption is about 5 Watt. PicSat Orbit and Communication PicSat was launched into Low Earth Orbit (600 km altitude) on 12 January 2018 by Indian ISRO on the PSLV PSLV-C40 mission. The orbit of PicSat is a polar orbit. This means that PicSat will orbit over the poles as the Earth rotates below it, which will allow it to observe Beta Pictoris continuously. Each orbit will take 94 minutes to complete. The satellite is operated from the PicSat Ground Station at the Paris Observatory in Meudon, France. However, the Ground Station is only able to see the satellite about 30 minutes per day. PicSat communicates at radio amateur frequencies. This has been made possible thanks to the involvement of the R√©seau des √âmetteurs Fran√ßais (REF). Anyone with radio receiving capabilities can tune in to the satellite's transmissions when it is passing overhead, receive information from the satellite, and upload it to a data base via the PicSat website. A large network of radio amateurs is called upon to collaborate with the tracking the satellite, receive its data and transmit it to the Ground Station. Interested person are referred to the PicSat website to register, follow the updates and become part of the radio network. Radio amateurs that are licensed to transmit can use PicSat as a transponder, when it is not doing science observation or other communication, to talk to other amateurs. The website will display this information. It will also show the up- to-date light curve of the star as measured by PicSat. The light curve is the brightness of the star as a function of time. PicSat was predicted to operate for one year. It operated for approximately 10 weeks before contact was lost on March 20, 2018. Attempts to re-establish contact were made, and on March 30, it was believed that contact was re-established by a team at Morehead State University but this turned out to be a signal from a different satellite (TIGRISAT). The mission was officially closed April 5. PicSat telescope support If PicSat were to measure the onset of the transit of the planet or its Hill Sphere, or any other transit like phenomena, the 3.6 meter diameter telescope from the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in Chile will immediately be put in action. This is thanks to a recently accepted proposal to ESO for opportunity observing time in support of the PicSat project, led by Dr. Flavien Kiefer from the Institut d'astrophysique de Paris. Dr. Kiefer is known for his work on the detection and observation of exo-comets in star systems such as Beta-Pictoris. The telescope will be equipped with the powerful HARPS instrument. HARPSis the acronym for High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher. Together with PicSat measurements, HARPSdata of a transit will allow more accurate determination the orbit and size of the planet and chemical makeup of the atmosphere. If a comet were to transit, HARPS will be able to determine the chemical composition of the comet's atmosphere, which carries key information about the chemical composition of the star system as a whole and thus its formation and evolution.

The other major pattern of API design in graphics libraries is the retained mode.  Implementations  Most of the immediate mode GUI widget toolkit is implemented in default system controls and custom rendering for game development, graphic apps, Library: Scale form, and Dear ImGui. For game implementation, a GUI should * be updated in sync with the game scene or complex graphic. * be overlaid on a game scene or complex graphic (which is especially easy in both cases, when both GUI and game scene are controlled by the game loop). * have an unusual appearance or be pepped with complex graphic. This implies that in an immediate mode GUI, the client code is holding its own rendering primitives and API design which affects the graphics pipeline implementation. The immediate mode GUI widget toolkit * is more direct in the sense that the widget tree is often a function call tree that is compostable and flexible but hard to interact with. * is less complex and easier to understand (in terms of fewer implicit assumptions per toolset API call). This usually also results in less functionality. * is more elaborate to create and manage (typically needs more tool set API calls) if more than a simple widget tree, including layout (absolute and relative positioning referring to parent or siblings). * has less sophisticated occlusion culling (z-buffering), hit-testing, state change handling, scrolling, and focus/hot control (widget) animations. This also implies the need to manage the logical tree/visual tree itself. * has to rebuild the vertex buffers completely from scratch for each new frame. * can put a constant workload on the CPU if not utilizing shaders loaded on the GPU. Immediate mode GUI widget toolkits are a good choice for those who prefer a simple, easily changeable, and extendable GUI toolkit. They are usually generic, open-source, and cross-platform. One way to have the flexibility and composability of an immediate mode GUI without the disadvantages of keeping the widget tree only in function calls, with the lack of direct control of how the GUI is drawn in the rendering engine would be to use a virtual widget tree, just like React uses a virtual DOM.  History  The original Immediate Mode GUI toolkit is imgui by Mikko Mononen which is based on OpenGL. The idea was popularized by Casey Muratori.  Other types of Immediate Mode GUI  * nuklear with backends for several graphics libraries (Direct3D, GLFW, OpenGL, SDL, SFML, Wayland, Windows DGI, Window GDI+ and X11) * kiss_sdl for SDL (Simple Direct Media Layer) * Gio for Go * Dear ImGui written in C++ with back-ends for several graphics APIs (Allegro 5 , DirectX, GLFW, iOS, Marmalade, Metal, OpenGL, SDL 2 and Vulkan), that also has ** projects for additional back-end support (Android, Irrlicht Engine, OGRE, SFML, ...) ** projects for additional language bindings (C#/.NET, D, Go, Haskell, Java, ...) ** ports to other languages (here the java virtual machine port)  References  Category:Computer graphics Category:Graphical user interfaces ","title":"Immediate mode GUI"},{"id":"55024493","text":"thumb The Rural Museum in Palau-sator The Rural Museum, inaugurated in 1996, is an ethnological collection of farmsteads, through which you can understand how life has evolved in the field.

It was written by Charlie Brooker and directed by John Hillcoat. The episode first aired on Netflix, along with the rest of series four, on 29 December 2017. Filmed in Iceland, the episode centres on Mia (Andrea Riseborough) who is distressed about having helped her friend Rob (Andrew Gower) cover up a hit-and-run death. Fifteen years later, Rob wants to confess their crime, leading Mia to kill him and dispose of his body. Shortly after, Mia witnesses a non-fatal collision between a pedestrian and self-driving vehicle. Shazia (Kiran Sonia Sawar) meanwhile is hired to investigate the crash, and uses a Recaller device that allows her to see the recent memories of those she interviews. Plot While driving drunk, Rob (Andrew Gower) hits and kills a cyclist on a mountain road. He convinces his passenger Mia Nolan (Andrea Riseborough) to help him cover up the death by throwing the man's body and bicycle into a lake. Fifteen years later, Mia is happily married with a son and a successful career as an architect. When she goes on a business trip, a newly sober Rob meets her at her hotel. He wants to write an anonymous letter telling the truth to the cyclist's wife, but Mia is afraid the letter will be traced. An argument ensues and she kills Rob. She is further shaken upon seeing a self-driving pizza delivery truck hit a pedestrian in the street, but manages to dispose of Rob's body in a building site without being seen. The man who was hit by the truck contacts his insurance company and is visited by Shazia (Kiran Sonia Sawar), an insurance investigator. She uses a device known as a Recaller to scan his and other witnesses' memories to verify the claims. Shazia follows a chain of witnesses near the collision scene, eventually leading her to Mia as the only potential direct witness. Mia admits to witnessing the crash, and tries to prepare her mind to focus away from Rob's murder, but she cannot stop memories of the homicide surfacing. Recognizing what she has seen, Shazia tries to leave, but Mia breaks into her car and incapacitates her, taking her to the shed where she is bound and gagged. Shazia promises that she will delete the Recaller data and keep silent, but Mia does not believe her. Mia scans Shazia's memories with the Recaller to learn that her husband Anan knew Shazia was going to visit Mia that day. Mia kills Shazia and drives to her home to kill Anan. Upon realising that Shazia's baby son is also in the house and has probably seen her face, Mia reluctantly kills him too. Police investigating the murders reveal that Shazia's son was blind and would have been unable to identify the killer; they instead use the Recaller on the family guinea pig to dredge its memories for evidence. Meanwhile, Mia cries as she watches her son's school production of Bugsy Malone. The police are seen waiting at the back of the auditorium. As the camera continues lingering on Mia, in tears, the screen cuts to black.  Analysis  Some critics have suggested that the title is a reference to the metaphor \\"crocodile tears\\", a phrase that could be referring to Mia's insincere expressions of sorrow while committing a series of violent crimes. Jason Koebler of Vice notes that Mia does not read the End-User License Agreement (EULA) for the Recaller. Koebler suggests that Mia reading the EULA would have allowed her to avoid using the Recaller, and thus prevent her later murders from being necessary.  Production  Whilst series one and two of Black Mirror were shown on Channel 4 in the UK, in September 2015 Netflix commissioned the series for 12 episodes, and in March 2016 it outbid Channel 4 for the rights to distribute the series in the UK, with a bid of $40 million. The 12 episode order was divided into two series of six episodes each. The six episodes in series four were released on Netflix simultaneously on 29 December 2017. \\"Crocodile\\" is listed as the third episode, though as each episode is standalone the episodes can be watched in any order. The episode has a running time of 59 minutes. = Writing and casting = The episode was inspired by the series one episode, \\"The Entire History of You\\", which featured a personal implant that one could use privately to review their memories. For \\"Crocodile\\", they considered what the situation would be like if these memories were not private, developing a \\"cat-and-mouse type drama\\" that would highlight the importance of memories, and to what lengths one with a secret would go to hide those memories. The episode was initially conceived as having a male protagonist, with Andrea Riseborough reading the script to audition for the insurance investigator‚Äîcalled Shazia in the final episode, and played by Kiran Sonia Sawar. However, Riseborough liked the journey of the protagonist and asked if the part could be rewritten as a woman. Both Brooker and executive producer Annabel Jones described the change as interesting, with Jones noting \\"How often do you see a mother reduced to this level of desperation?\\" Though they questioned whether a woman would have the physical strength to dispose of a body, Riseborough argued that her character could find that strength in desperation. Brooker commented that \\"the panicking male murderer is practically a trope\\", so the gender change was \\"refreshing\\". The episode ends with Mia killing Shazia's son, who turns out to be blind, and her murder of him is witnessed by a guinea pig. This was intended as dark humour in the tone of 1996 black comedy thriller Fargo, though the episode had been more serious up until that point. Mia then watches her son in a production of the 1976 musical film Bugsy Malone, which starred Jodie Foster‚Äîthe director of the preceding episode \\"Arkangel\\". Brooker explained that the title came from an analogy he made in an earlier draft of the script. In its original form, the script had involved a woman that had seen her mother die tragically at the age of two, causing her to become anxious and fearful of the rest of the world. He had compared this to a virtual reality trip down a jungle river with random events. Someone might go down this trip without seeing a crocodile and thus see it as a calm trip, but someone else might be attacked by a crocodile early on, and for the rest of the trip, become anxious and fearful that they are experiencing a \\"crocodile attack simulator\\", the same situation as this character. While the script significantly changed over the course of production, the title was not changed. = Filming = The episode was directed by John Hillcoat, who described the episode as a \\"pitch-black comedy of errors\\". Hillcoat said that \\"Crocodile\\" is about \\"how human beings actually work and how we would respond to something the tech revolution may well bring into our lives\\". The memory reader technology was conceived by Brooker with the arcade machine for Space Invaders in mind. Production designer Joel Collins compares it to a slide viewer, contrasting with the thin screens of contemporary devices. After the memory reader was designed, other technology in the episode such as the pizza truck were re-designed with similar box styles. The episode was shot in Iceland and includes scenes filmed in the Harpa concert hall. Brooker had originally called out for filming in Scotland in his script, but Netflix suggested Iceland as a \\"more stunning backdrop\\", according to Brooker. Hillcoat commented that the \\"cruel inescapable logic\\" of Mia's actions were suited for Icelandic \\"strange, vast and primeval landscapes\\". During filming, Iceland had its largest snowfall in forty years. The scenes involving the pizza van were the worst affected, with shooting taking place over two nights. Snow needed to be continually brushed and special effects teams used heaters and hoses on important areas in frame. A line was added to the dialogue about snow, the intention being that the difference in snow was a consequence of observers' differing memories. Riseborough's performance as Mia was less panicked than Brooker had pictured when writing the episode. Riseborough injured half of her ribcage during her first rehearsal. Hillcoat opined that Mia has ambition as a \\"deep inner flaw\\", whereas Jones thought her actions was a \\"logical inevitability\\" of her initially protecting her friend Rob. Brooker said that Mia \\"really turns\\" when she hides Rob's body, rather than confessing to causing his death. Sawar found the scene in which her character Shazia was killed by Mia difficult to film, and was unable to watch the scene in the finished episode. = Marketing = In May 2017, a Reddit post unofficially announced the names and directors of the six episodes in series 4 of Black Mirror. The first trailer for the series was released by Netflix on 25 August 2017, and contained the six episode titles. Beginning on 24 November 2017, Netflix published a series of posters and trailers for the fourth series of the show, referred to as the \\"13 Days of Black Mirror\\". On 6 December, Netflix published a trailer featuring an amalgamation of scenes from the fourth series, which announced that the series would be released on 29 December.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes reported that 53% of critics gave the episode positive reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10, based upon a sample of 17 reviews.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/black_mirror/s04/e03 The cinematography of the Icelandic landscape was widely praised, along with Riseborough's and Sawar's performances. Two critics criticised the violence and described it as unnecessarily bleak. At the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018, Toyota announced its customisable self-driving delivery vehicle, the e-Palette, with one of their first partners being Pizza Hut to create a self-driving pizza delivery truck. Commentators pointed out the coincidence of this announcement shortly after the first broadcast of \\"Crocodile\\", and the official Twitter account for Black Mirror commented on the announcement, \\"We know how this goes.\\"  References   External links  * Category:2017 British television episodes Category:Black Mirror episodes Category:Television episodes written by Charlie Brooker Category:Netflix original television series episodes ","title":"Crocodile (Black Mirror)"},{"id":"55024669","text":"German Type UE submarine may refer to: * German Type UE I submarine of WWI * German Type UE II submarine of WWI ","title":"German Type UE submarine"},{"id":"55024675","text":"Knipphals is a German surname.

It was written by Charlie Brooker and directed by Jodie Foster. The episode first aired on Netflix, along with the rest of series four, on 29 December 2017. In the episode, \\"Arkangel\\" is the name of an implanted chip technology that allows a parent to track and monitor their children, as well as pixelate images that would cause them distress. Single mother Marie (played by Rosemarie DeWitt) has her young daughter Sara implanted with Arkangel, which while initially effective, becomes a dangerous hindrance, and Marie allows Sara to grow up without the use of Arkangel. As Sara matures into a teenager (played by Brenna Harding), Marie becomes tempted to use Arkangel again. The episode was the first of Black Mirror to be directed by a woman. It has a strong emphasis on family. The episode was met with mixed reception and compared to an indie movie. Some critics praised the episode's concept, but thought the theme of helicopter parenting was emphasised at the expense of other, potentially more interesting aspects. Plot Protective single mother Marie Sambrell (Rosemarie DeWitt) loses sight of her daughter Sara at a playground; she is recovered shortly without incident. Fearing future crises, Marie signs up to participate in a trial of Arkangel, a revolutionary child monitoring system. An Arkangel representative administers Sara a neural implant. Via an included tablet computer, Marie can: monitor Sara's medical state, view her past and present vision and hearing, and censor obscenity and other stressful stimuli. The Arkangel system proves initially successful, censoring an intimidating neighborhood dog; however, flaws in the system present themselves, such as the obscenity filter preventing Sara from reacting appropriately to her grandfather's stroke. Years later, Sara (Sarah Abbott) has become socially outcast and emotionally immature. Marie has Sara assessed by a child psychologist, who concludes that the controversial and soon-to-be- banned Arkangel is responsible. Though the implant itself cannot be removed, he convinces Marie to deactivate the obscenity filter and stow the tablet away. Sara goes to school unsupervised for the first time, where her schoolmate Trick (Nicky Torchia) exposes her to gore and pornography. At age fifteen, Sara (Brenna Harding), now better adjusted, secretly attends a party with Trick (Owen Teague). Marie grows concerned after Sara fails to answer phone calls and her schoolmates' parents do not know her whereabouts. She reactivates the Arkangel tablet in a panic, only to discover Sara and Trick having sex. Some time later, Marie, having grown distrustful of her daughter, uses the Arkangel tablet again and sees Sara snorting cocaine with Trick. Identifying Trick with a reverse image search, Marie uses the footage to blackmail him into breaking up with Sara. Later, the tablet informs Marie that Sara is pregnant from her sleeping with Trick, and she sneaks an emergency contraceptive pill into her drink at breakfast. After vomiting due to the pill and discovering the reactivated tablet in Marie's bedroom, Sara realizes what Marie has done and confronts her. She pries the tablet from Marie's hands, accidentally reactivating the obscenity filter, and beats Marie unconscious with the tablet until it breaks. The filter deactivates moments later and Sara sees what she has done. A dazed Marie reawakens and, after attempting to use the destroyed tablet, exits the house and frantically calls Sara's name down the street. Meanwhile, having run away from home, Sara flags down a semi truck for a ride. Analysis One critic compares \\"Arkangel\\" to previous Black Mirror episodes \\"The Entire History of You\\" and \\"Be Right Back\\", as each episode is based on an existing technology, and plausibly demonstrates how the technology could go wrong in the future. Production Whilst series one and two of Black Mirror were shown on Channel 4 in the UK, in September 2015 Netflix commissioned the series for 12 episodes, and in March 2016 it outbid Channel 4 for the rights to distribute the series in the UK, with a bid of $40 million. The 12 episode order was divided into two series of six episodes each. The six episodes in series four were released on Netflix simultaneously on 29 December 2017. \\"Arkangel\\" is listed as the second episode, though as each episode is standalone the episodes can be watched in any order. The episode has a running time of 52 minutes. =Director and casting= \\"Arkangel\\" was directed by Jodie Foster, making it the first episode of Black Mirror to be directed by a woman. This was the first episode of Black Mirror directed by a woman, Jodie Foster‚Äîan actor, director and producer. According to Brooker, Foster was chosen for the episode because as a former child actor, she would understand what it was like to grow up in the spotlight, as well as how to deal with the child actors during filming. Netflix had also recommended Foster to Brooker, since she had previously directed episodes of their series Orange is the New Black and House of Cards. Foster was not previously familiar with the programme. Foster was raised by a single mother, and said that the script brought up \\"so many questions about who we are as women at this particular time in history\\". Foster was in control of casting the episode, leading to the casting of her friend Rosemarie DeWitt as Marie. The pair had met through Foster's wife Alexandra Hedison; this was only the second time Foster had worked with a friend as a director, after Mel Gibson in 2011 film The Beaver. Australian actor Brenna Harding was cast as Sara, after accidentally misinterpreting part of the audition tape instructions to perform a two-minute monologue in the character of Sara, rather than as herself. The three other children cast as younger versions of Sara had to be chosen to look very similar to Harding. Owen Teague's casting as Trick influenced the character: though written as a character to be distrusted, Foster says that Teague has \\"sweetness\\" and Harding describes Trick and Sara as \\"like two old souls who connected\\". =Writing and characterisation= Written by Charlie Brooker, the episode is intended to be sympathetic to helicopter parenting; Brooker took inspiration in how he felt protective following the birth of his children. Prior to having children, Brooker was unsympathetic to content restrictions designed for children, but he was concerned by his three-year-old son seeing a horror movie trailer after he had left him alone with YouTube on autoplay. He was also concerned by thoughts of his children accidentally seeing an accident or hearing profanity in their day-to-day life. Foster described the plot as progressing from \\"a family we recognise\\" to a mother who gradually \\"cross[es] the line\\". She cited the first scene, in which Marie feels guilty about having a Caesarean section, as evidence that she is \\"an unusually concerned mother\\", though Annabel Jones, co-producer for the series, remarked that Marie was not intended to be \\"overly neurotic or controlling\\", and that her use of Arkangel is a \\"slippery slope\\". Jones said that the idea of Arkangel came from microchip implants used to identify pets that, at the time of writing, were also being considered for children. Jones said, \\"We wanted to think what the updated version of that [was] and find a really good idea of how that could go terribly wrong\\". The original script gave Marie's father only a very minor part, but this was fleshed out by Foster. Foster also influenced other changes in the script, and offered many observations on the setting, the technology used and Marie's motivation for her actions after seeing her daughter have sex with Trick. Explaining the actions of her character Marie, DeWitt said that single mothers \\"experience betrayal differently\\". Foster adds that when Marie realises Sara is lying to her, but does not confront her, it causes a \\"fissure\\" and Marie begins \\"fighting a battle to win control\\". By attempting to prevent her daughter from leaving her, Marie is victim to a self-fulfilling prophecy as she \\"engendered the exact result that she most feared\\". =Filming= The episode was filmed over three weeks in Hamilton, Ontario, a location chosen to represent \\"blue-collar America\\". Foster described the fictional setting as a \\"place that used to have a foundation and a glory\\", which reflects how Marie views herself. It began in November 2016, starting just around the 2016 United States presidential election. Foster states that the filming involved \\"very long hours\\" and that the scenes starring the younger children were particularly troublesome. Displaying graphic content was avoided in the episode, with Foster believing it would \\"distract from what the meaning was\\". An exception was the scene where Sara attacks her mother. Brooker notes that in this scene, more whacks were filmed than made it into the episode, though enough were needed for the viewer to understand Sara's perspective, and for Marie to be plausibly rendered unconscious. The final shot of the episode, where Marie frantically tries to use the tablet shouting \\"No!\\" repeatedly, was filmed the day after the election results were in, Donald Trump becoming the incumbent president; DeWitt injected her personal reaction at the results into the scene. Foster flew to London to help with the episode's editing alongside Brooker. Foster describes the ending as a \\"parable\\". DeWitt's first day on set was to film the scene where a bloodied Marie runs out of the house screaming for her daughter. The episode ends with Sara entering a truck, which was originally a small car in the script. The choice of a truck implies that Sara will be travelling far, and Harding describes her feeling for the ending as \\"a mixture of nervous trepidation and excitement for Sara\\". The song \\"I'm a Mother\\" by The Pretenders plays over the scene, chosen as a \\"plaintive song\\" which reminds viewers of \\"the mother's perspective\\", according to Foster. =Marketing= In May 2017, a Reddit post unofficially announced the names and directors of the six episodes in series 4 of Black Mirror. The first trailer for the series was released by Netflix on 25 August 2017, and contained the six episode titles. In September 2017, two photos from the fourth season were released, including one from \\"Arkangel\\". Beginning on 24 November 2017, Netflix published a series of posters and trailers for the fourth series of the show, referred to as the \\"13 Days of Black Mirror\\". On 6 December, Netflix published a trailer featuring an amalgamation of scenes from the fourth series, which announced that the series would be released on 29 December. Reception Praising Foster's directing and DeWitt's acting, Adam Starkey of Metro writes that the episode is about a \\"recognisable paranoia\\" which compensates for the \\"slightly predictable\\" execution of the episode. In a positive review for Den of Geek, Louisa Mellor praises the \\"deft balance\\" given to the ethical quandary explored by the episode, as well as Foster's \\"sensitive and emotional US indie-movie style\\" and how the story is told not with authority, but \\"with empathy\\". Sophie Gilbert of The Atlantic opines that despite the episode's excellent premise, it fails due to lack of execution. Gilbert further asserts that the episode's moral is obvious, and the question of what impact adult imagery has on a child is interesting but not explored far enough. In a three star review for The Telegraph, Ed Power has the same criticism that Brooker could \\"delve further\\" into the repercussions of children watching violent and pornographic images, calling the episode \\"archetypal Black Mirror, almost to a fault\\". Planned Parenthood has criticised the episode for an inaccurate display of how emergency contraceptive pills work; the episode implies that these pills terminate a pregnancy, whereas some prevent or delay ovulation. =Episode rankings= \\"Arkangel\\" is ranked below average by critics who rated each of the 19 episodes of Black Mirror by quality: * 11th ‚Äì Corey Atad, Esquire * 11th ‚Äì Aubrey Page, Collider * 11th ‚Äì Matt Donnelly and Tim Molloy, TheWrap * 16th ‚Äì James Hibberd, Entertainment Weekly * 17th ‚Äì Steve Greene, Hanh Nguyen and Liz Shannon Miller, IndieWire * 19th ‚Äì Charles Bramesco, Vulture Proma Khosla of Mashable reviewed the show's 19 episodes based on tone, ranking \\"Arkangel\\" as 10th most pessimistic.

Reinhold Konstantin Svento (until 1938 Sventorzetsky, July 24, 1881, St. Petersburg, Russian Empire - March 30, 1973 Lappeenranta) was a Finnish politician who served as a speaker of the Finnish Social Democratic Party between 1922 and 1945 and MP from the Finnish People's Democratic League 1945-1948, 1944-1948 as II Foreign Minister in three Governments and 1948-1951 as Envoy of Finland to Bern. Svento, also a member of the Helsinki City Council, also acted as a five-times electoral in presidential elections. Biography Sventorzetsky graduated from the University of St. Petersburg in 1907 and worked as an official in General Governor's Office, but had to resign in 1914 at the request by Governor Franz Seyn. After the Civil War, Social Democrat Sventorzetski served as a journalist for several Social Democratic journals. In the parliamentary election in 1922 he was elected to the parliament from the constituency of the Mikkeli County. Sventorzetsky wrote to the Social Democratic main vocalist newspaper Social Democrat from 1918-1920 and 1924-1944. In the 1920s, Sventorzetsky belonged to the left of the SDP and to the so-called Huplian Opposition. He was elected to the party committee at the 1926 party congress. That same year, Sventorzetsky objected to his party's move to the government. Sventorzetsky, representing the moderate opposition in the 1930s, was one of the leading foreign policy experts in the party. From the 1920s Svento supported the cooperation between Social Democrats and Agrarian League. In 1937, Svento published the book The Worker and Peasant, in which he considered the government of the Social Democrats and the Agrarian League essential for the maintenance of a democratic society under the pressure of fascism and communism.Hannu Soikkanen: Kohti kansanvaltaa 2 (SDP 1987), s. 17. In the following year, Finland's foreign policy appeared, in which Svento warned of the difficult position of Finland in the event of a possible war. Svento did not believe the importance of ideological issues in foreign policy and he favored a neutral balancing between the great powers. In the negotiations between Finland and the Soviet Union in the autumn of 1939, Svento demanded absolute neutrality from Finland.Hannu Soikkanen: Kohti kansanvaltaa 2 (SDP 1987), s. 36, 39‚Äì40, 47, 49, 52, 93, 96. After the Winter War he considered the conflict as a major imperialism of the Great powers. During the Continuation WarHannu Soikkanen: Kohti kansanvaltaa 2 (SDP 1987), s. 411. ., Svento was involved in the peace opposition movement. After the Continuation War, Svento moved to the People's Democratic League with many other Social Democratic party leaders who were divided in the party's policy. As a Foreign Minister in April 1948, Svento was a member of the Negotiation delegation considering the Finno-Soviet Treaty. In September 1955, he was a member of the delegation led by President J. K. Paasikivi, with whom the Soviet Union agreed to return the Porkkala Base back to Finland. At the end of her public career, Svento was part of the Finnish delegation to the United Nations in 1955-1958. Reinhold Svento and First Foreign Minister Carl Enckell often used to talk and exchange correspondence with each other in Russian. Both had served as civil servant at the Minister‚ÄìSecretary of States Office in St. Petersburg.K.-A. Fagerholm: Puhemiehen √§√§ni, s. 223. Helsinki: Tammi, 1977. The role of Svento and Enckell as assistants and advisers to J. K. Paasikivi also underlined the fact that the head of the Political Department's highest official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was held throughout their ministry without the holder.Max Jakobson: Pelon ja toivon aika: 20. vuosisadan tilinp√§√§t√∂s II, s. 153. Helsinki: Otava, 2001. Reinhold Svento received the honor of the Minister in 1971. Family Reinhold Svento's first spouse from 1907 to 1953 was Antti Hackzell's sister Evi Hackzell.

He was tried, and convicted on July 2, 1976. Zeigler was sentenced to death for two of the murders, in addition to life imprisonment. Murders and conviction On July 2, 1976, thirty-year-old Tommy Zeigler was convicted of the quadruple murder of his wife, Eunice Zeigler, and her parents, Perry and Virginia Edwards, as well as a customer named Charlie Mays at his furniture store in Winter Garden, Florida on December 24, 1975. Zeigler, who was wounded by a gunshot to his abdomen, and charged while in a hospital days after the murders, was given the death penalty for the murders of his wife and Mays, and life imprisonment for the murders of his wife's parents. According to the prosecution, Zeigler's motive for the murders was two life insurance policies of $500,000 in total, which were taken out on his wife months prior to the murders. The prosecution claimed that he shot himself in an attempt to make it look like Mays and two men named Edward Williams and Felton Thomas, who would both testify against Zeigler, were the perpetrators of a robbery that ended in the murders of Eunice Zeigler and her parents. Due to publicity, the trial was moved to Jacksonville, Florida. Five guns were found at the scene; approximately 30 bullets had been fired inside the store. In addition, a metal crank was used to bludgeon Perry Edwards and Charlie Mays to death. Since the murders, Zeigler has maintained that he was a victim of a botched robbery attempt, and that Charlie Mays was involved. As recent as 2015, Zeigler believes that his brother-in-law, Perry Edwards, Jr., was the person that orchestrated the murders. Controversy The case against Zeigler, and his trial, has been the subject of criticism by many, including civil rights activist Bianca Jagger, and a juror who voted to convict Zeigler. Among the criticized points was the judge who oversaw the trial, Maurice M. Paul; months prior to the murders, both Zeigler and Judge Paul testified in an unrelated case on opposing sides. Although the jury at Zeigler's trial recommended life imprisonment, Judge Paul instead sentenced Zeigler to death. At Zeigler's trial, one of the key eyewitnesses for the prosecution, Felton Thomas, testified that on the night of the murders, he, Zeigler and Charlie Mays drove to an orange grove to fire some guns. The prosecution believed that this was a plan from Zeigler to get their fingerprints on the guns. In 2013, however, Felton Thomas recanted parts of his testimony. In 2011, Zeigler's private investigator, Lynn-Marie Carty, located a new eyewitness named Robert Foster, who, on the night of the murders, attempted to rob a gas station across the street from the Zeigler Furniture Store. Don Frye, the lead investigator on the case, had lied about Foster, saying his name was a typographical error. Zeigler is incarcerated at Union Correctional Institution in Raiford, Florida Aftermath Zeigler was scheduled to be executed on October 22, 1982. However, the U.S. District Court in Jacksonville stayed the execution due to new evidence. Zeigler was then scheduled to be executed on May 20, 1986. The execution was stayed by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeal due to inadequate representation. In April 1988, Zeigler's death sentence was overturned. Zeigler was re-sentenced and again given the death penalty. In 2005, Zeigler's request for a new trial was denied after DNA tests failed to conclude that Charlie Mays was the perpetrator. Zeigler's case was denied bloodstain DNA analysis in 2013 and 2016. In April 2017, Zeigler's case was denied Touch DNA analysis. In popular culture Zeigler's case was featured on television program, Unsolved Mysteries. Zeigler is still in prison. A documentary entitled \\"A Question of Innocence\\" was released in 2014 about Zeigler's case, and the death penalty in the United States. In 1992, a book was released by Phillip Finch on Zeigler's case, entitled Fatal Flaw: A True Story of Malice and Murder in a Small Southern Town.

The cause of the revolts was mainly refusal of Syrian peasants to answer conscription and disarmament orders of new Egyptian rulers of the Muhammad Ali dynasty, in line with anti-Egyptian attitudes of local Ottoman loyalists.Talhamy, ‚ÄúThe Nusayri and Druze Minorities in Syria in the Nineteenth Century: The Revolt against the Egyptian Occupation as a Case Study,‚Äù 983. Background The First Egyptian-Ottoman War (1831‚Äì1833) was a military conflict brought about by Muhammad Ali Pasha's demand to the Ottoman Empire for control of Greater Syria, as reward for his assistance in Crete against Greece. As a result, Muhammad Ali's forces temporarily gained control of Syria, and advanced as far north as Adana. Arenas =Peasant revolts in Palestine and Transjordan= The Peasants' RevoltBaer, 1982, p. 254Grossman, 2011, p. 47 was a rebellion against Egyptian conscription and taxation policies in Palestine. It was a collective reaction to the gradual elimination of the unofficial rights and privileges previously enjoyed by the various societal groups in the region under Ottoman rule.Rood, 2004, p. 139 While the local peasantry constituted the bulk of the rebel forces, urban notables and Bedouin tribes also formed an integral part of the revolt. =Sidon Eyalet revolt (1834)= In parallel to the Peasant uprising in Palestine (south of the Damascus Eylaet), Galilee- based rebels captured Safad and Tiberias in the eastern Galilee. The Hauran was also encompassed by the rebellion. The most severe events took place in Galilee, climaxing with the 1834 looting of Safed which was mostly an attack against the Jewish community of Safed, which began on Sunday 15 June 1834, and lasted for the next 33 days.Bloch, Abraham P. One a day: an anthology of Jewish historical anniversaries, 1987. pg. 168. Rabbi Isaac b. Solomon Farhi records that the pillage continued for 24 days. The governor of Safed and thirteen of the ringleaders were taken captive, summarily tried, and put to death. The district governor tried to quell the violent outbreak, but failed to do so and fled. Upon arrival of Muhammad Ali was in Damascus Eyalet, he requested military assistance from Emir Bashir Shihab II of Mount Lebanon, via an emissary, Emir Shihab's son Amin. The arrival of Bashir's Druze troops followed intervention of foreign consuls. In late July 1834, Emir Bashir led his forces toward Galilee, but before advancing further southward, he made a number of proclamations advising that the rebels of Safad surrender. The rebel leadership in Safad agreed to negotiate and sent Sheikh Salih al-Tarshihi as an emissary to Bashir to arrange a meeting. Bashir invited the leaders of Safad to the village of Bint Jbeil where they agreed to surrender and submit to Egyptian authority. Afterward, Bashir arrived in Safad where he arranged for rebel leaders from nearby areas to surrender as well. Bashir's Druze forces under the command of his son Amin,Farah 2000, p. 22. entered Safad without resistance on 18 July 1834, making way for the displaced residents from its Jewish quarter to return. The instigators were arrested and later executed in Acre. =Alawite revolt= Between 1834 and 1835, Bashir's forces commanded by Khalil and his relatives participated in the suppression of revolts in Akkar, Safita, the Krak des Chevaliers and an Alawite revolt in the mountainous region of Latakia.

History  = Colonial period = Very little archaeological work was carried out in the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period, even though the Spaniards were interested in the people of the islands from an ethnographic and linguistic perspective. Explorers such as Fedor Jagor, Joseph Montano and Paul Ray, and Jose Rizal, occasionally reported visiting sites, but the only detailed investigation was carried out by French archaeologist Alfred Marche in 1881. Commissioned by the French government, Marche conducted systematic surveys of burial caves on two islands, accumulating a large collection of antiquities which is now held in the Mus√©e de l'Homme in Paris. The most influential early figure in the archaeology of the Philippines was American anthropologist H. Otley Beyer. Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States in 1898, and the American colonial administration actively encouraged the anthropological study of the archipelago. Beyer was therefore invited to establish the University of the Philippines' anthropology department in 1914. Early surveys and collections were carried out in the 1920s by Beyer, Dean C. Worcester, and Carl Guthe. Various private collectors and amateur archaeologists also accumulated significant amounts of material, but Beyer lamented that \\"none of this work was very scientifically done\\". The first major archaeological project in the Philippines was the Rizal-Bulacan Archaeological Survey (1926‚Äì1930), prompted by the discovery of finds during the construction of the Novaliches Dam in Rizal Province. Beyer opened substantial excavations in the area of the dam, employing up to seventy workers a day for six months. He also conducted a five-year survey of the surrounding area, cataloguing 120 sites and nearly 500,000 artefacts. In 1932, Beyer assisted F. G. Roth in beginning a second major project, the Batangas Archaeological Survey, which involved surveys and excavation in the Cuenca region. He also collected material from a number of localities around the islands throughout the 1930s and early 1940s. American colonial archaeology in the Philippines came to an end in 1941 when the islands were occupied by the Japanese. Beyer was interned by the occupying forces, although he was allowed to continue his work at the university. During this time he compiled two synoptic papers, 'Outline review of Philippine archaeology by islands and provinces' (1947) and Philippine and East Asian Archaeology (1948), which laid the foundation for subsequent Philippine archaeology. = Post-independence = The Philippines gained independence from the United States in the 1946, but Beyer continued at his post at the University of Philippines until 1954. In 1949 he was joined by Wilhelm Solheim. In the 1960s Robert B. Fox did archaeological work in the Philippines. He is most famous for his research in the Tabon Caves.  Notable sites and discoveries  =Stone Age= Palaeolithic *The earliest evidence of hominins living in the Philippines is the 700,000-year-old remains of a butchered rhinoceros in Kalinga Province in Luzon. Predating the existence of Homo sapiens by at least 400,000, the butchered rhinoceros and the stone tools around it point to a possible colonization of Homo erectus or another possible Homo the Denisovans. *The 67,000-year-old Callao Man.Severino, Howie G. (August 1, 2010). Researchers discover fossil of human older than Tabon Man was found in Callao cave and, before the found remains of 700,000 year old rhinoceros, was the oldest human fossil in the Asia Pacific region. *The Tabon Caves have produced a number of archaeological finds, indicating it was occupied almost continuously between 50,000 and 9000 years ago. Notably, a collection of anatomically modern human remains known as the Tabon Man was for a long time the oldest known evidence of a human presence in the Philippines. *Later findings shed light on the daily lives of hunter-gatherers occupying a rock shelter in Ille Caves, Palawan, Philippines. Located near the Tabon Caves, the Ille Caves rock shelter was occupied many times, but the oldest stratigraphic layer puts the first occupation of that rock shelter at c. 14,000 cal bp (calibrated years before present). This assessment was made based on the presence of charcoal, placing this site well into the Pleistocene. Neolithic *The Angono Petroglyphs- the oldest known work of art in the Philippines located in the province of Rizal. There are 127 human and animal figures engraved on the rockwall probably carved during the late Neolithic. These inscriptions clearly show stylized human figures, frogs and lizards, along with other designs that may have depicted other interesting figures but erosion may have caused it to become indistinguishable. The engravings are mostly symbolic representations and are associated with healing and sympathetic magic. The site has been declared by the National Museum of the Philippines as a National Cultural Treasure in 1973. * Alab Petroglyphs of Mountain Province * Penablanca Petrographs of Cagayan Province * Singnapan Caves Petrographs of southern Palawan *Anda Peninsula Petrographs of Eastern Bohol * Lapuz Lapuz Cave * Lal-lo and Gattaran Shell Middens ‚Äì The Lal-lo and Gattaran Shell Middens are located along the banks of the Cagayan River in the province of Cagayan, Philippines. It is currently under consideration as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. * Yawning Jarlet-The Late Neolithic period in the Philippines, Evidence shows by a Yawning Jarlet on the Burial site in Leta-leta caves in Palawan by Robert Fox which had later become National treasure in the Philippines. It is the earliest pot recovered in the country  * Bark cloth beater ‚Äì It is a stone tool used for the preparation of bark cloth. Early Palawenios fashioned the beaters from cylindrical stones and used the stone beaters for pounding the bark to loosen the pulp from the fiber. The bark cloth is ready when all the pulp has been stripped off, leaving a network of fibers. The stone tool found in Arku Cave, Penablanca, Cagayan was dated 1255-605 B.C. Another bark-cloth beater was found in Sagung cave in Southern Palawan. * Jade Artifacts- or Jade Culture made from white and green nephrite and dating as far back as 2000‚Äì1500 BC, has been discovered at a number of archeological excavations in the Philippines since the 1930s. The artifacts have been both tools like chisels, and ornaments such as lingling-o earrings, bracelets and beads. A \\"jade culture\\" is said to have existed as evidenced by tens of thousands of exquisitely crafted jade artifacts found at a site in Batangas province. = Metal Age = * Manunggul Jar (890‚Äì710 B.C.) is a secondary burial jar excavated from a burial site in the Manunggul cave of the Tabon Caves at Lipuun Point in Palawan. It dates from 890‚Äì710 B.C. and the two prominent figures at the top handle of its cover represent the journey of the soul to the afterlife. * Artifacts from the \\"Sa Huyun-Kalanay\\" pottery complex in Masbate (dated 400BC-1500 AD.) :The Sa Huyun Culture was a culture in modern- day central and southern Vietnam that flourished between 1000 BC and 200 AD.John N.

The Sa Huynh people were most likely the predecessors of the Cham people, an Austronesian-speaking people and the founders of the kingdom of Champa.Higham, C., 2014, Early Mainland Southeast Asia, Bangkok: River Books Co., Ltd., * Maitum Anthropomorphic Pottery (190 BC to 500 AD)‚Äì In 1991, the National Museum archaeological team discovered anthropomorphic secondary burial jars in Ayub Cave, Barangay Pinol, Maitum, Sarangani Province, Mindanao, Philippines, dating them to be from between 190 BC and 500 AD. The jars are commonly known today as Maitum jars. They are made of earthenware, and are characterized by their design that suggests human figures with complete or partial facial features of the first inhabitants in Mindanao. Furthermore, they give emphasis to the Filipinos‚Äô popular belief of life after death.Dizon, E. (1996). Faces from Maitum: The archaeological excavation of Ayub Cave. Manila: National Museum of the Philippines. pp. xi‚Äìxii, 51‚Äì53, 56‚Äì59, 73, 78‚Äì82. * Sultan Kudarat Anthropomorphic Pottery (not yet carbon-dated) - In 2008, officials found a tricycle (common Philippine vehicle) carrying artifacts similar in shape with the Maitum Anthropomorphic Potteries, but are painted, and have clearer expressions. The shards were explicitely crafted, more expertly than those found in Sarangani in 1991. The looter afterwards presented forged documents of his ownership on the shards. He was afterwards arrested. The National Museum of the Philippines confirmed that the way the jar shards were made is new to Philippine archaeology, as no known ethnic group in the entire country is known to craft such precise pieces of burial jars. The museum confirmed that the jars may be the remnant artifacts of a lost tribe in the Philippines that may have gone extinct prior to colonization. The jars were found 'somewhere in Sultan Kudarat province' according to the reports, but the true location has not been determined as the caught looter is only a part of the chain which looted the artifacts from its original location. Other scholars speculate that the jars came from Maguindanao. In either case, looking for the original archaeological site of the jars was deemed as a difficult task as both Sultan Kudarat and Maguindanao are home to Muslim rebels fighting government forces, making it hard for scholars to enter the area and make an expedition. Funding on a possible expedition was also deemed as extremely limited. No expedition to locate the original archaeological site of the jars has been made up to present time. Research on the jars have also been hindered as expert findings can only be made once the location has been well-researched on, according to the National Museum. =Early Historic Period (900‚Äì1521)=  Architecture  = Indigenous Architecture= * Idjang- A triangle-shaped Citadel erected in Batanes Islands in the Philippines, made from limestone and wood. * Limestone tombs of Kamhantik is an excavated remains of a thousand-year-old village found in the jungles of Mount Maclayao in Sitio Kamhantik within the Buenavista Protected Landscape of Mulanay, Quezon, Philippines. It is composed of fifteen limestone coffins that can be dated back from the period of 10th to 14th century based on one of National Museum's top archaeologist \\"a complex archaeological site with both habitation and burial remains from the period of approximately 10th to the 14th century ... the first of its kind in the Philippines having carved limestone tombs.\\" = Islamic Architecture= * Sheik Karimol Makhdum Mosque ‚Äì located in Barangay Tubig Indangan, Simunul, Tawi-Tawi, Philippines. It is the oldest mosque in the Philippines and was built by an Arab trader, Sheikh Makhdum Karim in 1380. The original pillars of the old mosque can still be found inside the new building.MINDANAW: Oldest mosque needs repair It is also declared as a National Historical Landmark by the National Historical Commission Burial sites and grave artifacts * Oton death mask ‚Äì Discovered in the 1960s by Alfredo Evanghilista and F. Landa Jocan, it consists of gold nose-disc and eye mask find in an ancient grave in Oton, Iloilo. The Death Mask was used to cover the faces of the dead to inhibit evil spirits from entering the body of the deceased. This practice was brought over from China to the Philippines between the late 14th to 15th century. * The Kabayan Mummies of Benguet also known as the Kabayan Mummies, Benguet Mummies, or Ibaloi Mummies, are a group of mummies found along the mountain slopes of Kabayan, a town in the northern part of the Philippines. They were made from as early as 2000 BC until the 16th century, when Spain colonized the Philippines. Today, they remain in natural caves and a museum in Kabayan. Clothing or Jewelry * Banton Colth-The Banton cloth is the earliest known warp ikat (tie-resist dyeing) textile in Southeast Asia. Estimated to be 400 years old, the burial cloth was found in a wooden coffin that also contained blue and white ceramics in Banton Island, Romblon. The shroud was woven from red, black and white abaca threads. At present, the people in Bontok, Mt. Province use a colorful burial cloth to wrap the dead. * Lingling-o- Lingling-o are an \\"omega shaped\\" type of pendant or amulet that has been associated with various indigenous cultures of the Philippines since the early metal age. The earliest surviving examples of lingling-o, dating back to the metal age, were made out of Nephrite jade, but many later examples were made of shell, gold, copper, and wood; the kind of material suggests differences in the social standing of its wearer. Recent findings in the Northern Philippine province of Batanes, led by anthropologist Peter Bellwood in the early 2000s, have led to the discovery of an ancient goldsmith's shop that made the 20-centuries-old lingling-o, providing evidence of the indigenous Philippine manufacture of such artifacts as early as 2500 years ago. * The Philippines's archaeological finds include many ancient gold artifacts.Jesus T. Peralta, \\"Prehistoric Gold Ornaments CB Philippines,\\" Arts of Asia, 1981, 4:54‚Äì60.Art Exhibit: Philippines' 'Gold of Ancestors' in Newsweek. Currency * Piloncitos ‚Äì the earliest form of precious metal based currency of the Philippines. It is likely made of pure gold with a weight ranging between .5 grams to more or less than 3 gramss a size of a corn kernel‚Äîand weigh from 0.09 to 2.65 grams of fine gold. Large Piloncitos weighing 2.65 grams approximate the weight of one mass. Piloncitos have been excavated from Mandaluyong, Bataan, the banks of the Pasig River, Batangas, Marinduque, Samar, Leyte and some areas in Mindanao. *Gold ring currencies- The early Filipinos traded Piloncitos also along with Gold rings, which is gold ring-like ingots. These barter rings are bigger than doughnuts in size and are made of nearly pure gold. Documents, inscriptions, or seals * Laguna Copperplate Inscription- The oldest written document in the Philippines found in Lumban River dated in 900 AD which is written in Kawi. * Butuan Silver Paleograph also known as the \\"Butuan Silver Strip\\", is a piece of metal with Kawi inscriptions found in Butuan province in the mid-1970s by a team of archaeologists from the National Museum of the Philippines. * Ticao Stone Inscription also known as Monreal stone or Rizal Stone ‚Äì A limestone contains ancient script Baybayin. Found by pupils of Rizal Elementary School on Ticao Island in Monreal town, Masbate province, which had scraped the mud off their shoes and slippers on two irregular shaped limestone tablets before entering their classroom. are now housed at a section of the National Museum, which weighs 30 kilos, is 11 centimeters thick, 54 cm long and 44 cm wide while the other is 6 cm thick, 20 cm long and 18 cm wide. * The Baybayin Archives of the University of Santo Tomas in Manila, one of the largest archives in the Philippines, currently possesses the biggest collection of extant ancient Baybayin alphabets in the world. * Butuan Ivory Seal- an ivory stamp or seal stamp or a privy seal associated with a Rhinoceros Ivory Tusk, dated 9th‚Äì12th century, was found in Libertad, Butuan in Agusan del Norte in southern Philippines. Inscribed on the seal is the word Butban in stylized Kawi. The script has a similarity to the Tagalog script. Butban, was presumed to stand for Butwan or Butuan, since the letters ‚Äúb‚Äù and ‚Äúw‚Äù were frequently interchanged. The ivory seal is now housed at the National Museum of the Philippines.  Iconography  = Hindu-Buddhist = Although some 20th century historians believed that the various cultures of the Philippine archipelago first encountered Hindu and/or Buddhist beliefes as early as the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE, more recent scholarship suggests that these cultural influences mostly filtered in during the 10th through the early 14th centuries. Present-day scholarship believes these religious and cultural influences mostly came through trade with Southeast Asian thassalocratic empires such as the Srivijaya and Majapahit, which had in turn had trade relationships with India. Scholars such as Milton Osborne emphasise that despite these beliefs being originally from India, they reached the Philippines through Southeast Asian cultures with Austronesian roots. Artifacts reflect the iconography of the Vajrayana Buddhism and its influences on the Philippines's early states.Laszlo Legeza, \\"Tantric Elements in the Philippines PreHispanic Gold Arts,\\" Arts of Asia, 1988, 4:129‚Äì136. * Bronze Lokesvara ‚Äì This is bronze statue of Lokesvara was found in Isla Puting Bato in Tondo, Manila. * Buddha Amithaba bass relief The Ancient Batangue√±os were influenced by India as shown in the origin of most languages from Sanskrit and certain ancient potteries. A Buddhist image was reproduced in mould on a clay medallion in bas-relief from the municipality of Calatagan. According to experts, the image in the pot strongly resembles the iconographic portrayal of Buddha in Siam, India, and Nepal. The pot shows Buddha Amithaba in the tribhanga pose inside an oval nimbus. Scholars also noted that there is a strong Mahayanic orientation in the image, since the Boddhisattva Avalokitesvara was also depicted. * Golden Garuda of Palawan- The other finds are the garuda, the mythical bird that is common to Buddhism and Hinduism, Another gold artifact, from the Tabon Caves in the island of Palawan, is an image of Garuda, the bird who is the mount of Vishnu. The discovery of sophisticated Hindu imagery and gold artifacts in Tabon Caves has been linked to those found from Oc Eo, in the Mekong Delta in Southern Vietnam. * Bronze Ganesha statues ‚Äì A crude bronze statue of a Hindu Deity Ganesha has been found by Henry Otley Beyer in 1921 in an ancient site in Puerto Princesa, Palawan and in Mactan. Cebu the crude bronze statue indicates of its local reproduction. * Mactan Alokitesvara ‚Äì Excavated in 1921 in Mactan, Cebu by H.O.Beyer the statue is bronze may be a siva-buddhist blending rather than \\"pure Buddhist\\". * The Golden Tara was discovered in 1918 in Esperanza, Agusan by Bilay Campos a Manobo tribeswoman.Agusan Gold Image only in the Philippines The Golden Tara was eventually brought to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois in 1922. Henry Otley Beyer, and some experts have agreed on its identity and have dated it to belong within 900‚Äì950 CE. They can not place, however, its provenance because it has distinct features.Agusan Image Documents, Agusan-Surigao Historical Archives. * Golden Kinnari- The golden- vessel kinnari was found in 1981 in Surigao. The kinnari exists in both Buddhist and Hindu mythology. In Buddhism, the kinnari, a half-human and half- bird creature, represents enlightened action. The Buddhist Lotus Sutra mentions the kinnari as the celestial musician in the Himavanta realm. The kinnari takes the form of a centaur, however, in India's epic poem, the Mahabharata, and in the Veda's Purana part. * Padmapani and Nandi images ‚Äì Padmapani is also known as Avalokitesvara, the wisdom being or Bodhisattva of Compassion. Golden jewelry found so far include rings, some surmounted by images of Nandi ‚Äì the sacred bull, linked chains, inscribed gold sheets, gold plaques decorated with repouss√© images of Hindu deities.Anna T.

Journal of Southeast Asian Archaeology 17: 30‚Äì37 The Laguna Copperplate Inscription (above) found in 1989 suggests Indian cultural influence in the Philippines by the 9th century AD, likely through Hinduism in Indonesia, prior to the arrival of European colonial empires in the 16th century.  Ships  The 307x307px * Balangay (Butuan Boat)- the first wooden watercraft excavated in Southeast Asia and is evidence of early Filipino craftsmanship and their seamanship skills during pre-colonial times. The Balanghai Festival is also a celebration in Butuan, Agusan del Norte to commemorate the coming of the early migrants that settled the Philippines, on board the Balangay boats. When the first Spaniards arrived in the 16th century, they found the Filipinos living in well-organized independent villages called barangays. The name barangay originated from balangay, the Austronesian word for \\"sailboat\\". * The Pandanan Shipwreck is a 15th-century archaeological siteSakuma, S. (1989) \\"Prohibition of Overseas Trade and its Influence of International Relations in the Early Reign of the Ming Dynasty\\" Journal of East-West Maritime Relations, vol. 1, pp. 31‚Äì46. which was excavated in 1995 by the Underwater Archaeology Division of the National Museum of the Philippines in Pandanan Island, in the coast of Southern Palawan. The ship was surmised to be a Southeast Asian cargo boat travelling from either Vietnam or Southern China and is one of the best preserved pre-Spanish trading ships within the jurisdiction of Philippines. It is speculated that the ship stopped at some ports in Mainland Southeast Asia to load trade wares. Bad weather might have led to the sinking of the ship.Cayron, J. (2006) \\"Stringing the Past: An Archaeological Understanding of Early Southeast Asian Glass Bead Trade\\" The University of the Philippines Press. Utensils  Indigenous utensil artifacts  * Calatagan Ritual pot ‚Äì a clay pot contain Badlit inscriptions, The pot was probably also used for ceremonies to retrieve victims of bugkut, disappeared persons believed to have been abducted by dwellers of the spirit world. The paper provides a glossary of 26 Bisayan words that could be derived from the Calatagan Pot inscription.  Tradeware artifacts  = Porcelain tradeware = Porcelain tradeware from Vietnam, Taiwan, and China were so prevalent during the Philippines \\"late metal age\\" that early scholars of Philippine anthropology came to refer to the period as the Philippines' \\"Porcelain age.\\" Before the discovery of the Laguna Copperplate Inscription in the early 1990s, anthropologist, the richness of historical clues which could be derived from these porcelain artifacts led scholars to use the term \\"protohistory.\\" The Iron Age consisted of a phase called the \\"Porcelain Age,\\" and porcelain in this phase entered the Philippines around the nineteenth century A.D. along with \\"glazed stoneware\\" from Southeast Asia. * The \\"Flying elephant of Lenna Shoal\\" plate is considered a remarkable example of Chinese tradeware, with only two extant examples known in the world today. =Colonial (1521‚Äì1946)= Spanish colonial period * Magellan's Cross is a Christian cross planted by Portuguese and Spanish explorers as ordered by Ferdinand Magellan upon arriving in Cebu in the Philippines on (depending on source) 15 March 1521. The Santo Ni√±o de Ceb√∫, one of the oldest Christian relics in the Philippines. * The Santo Ni√±o de Ceb√∫ is a Roman Catholic title of a statue of the Child Jesus in Cebu City of Philippines.

It is one of the oldest Christian relics in the Philippines, originally given in 1521 as a gift by explorer Ferdinand Magellan to Rajah Humabon and his wife when he landed on the island. * The Black Nazarene is a life-sized image of a dark-skinned, kneeling Jesus Christ carrying the Cross enshrined in the Minor Basilica of the Black Nazarene in the Quiapo district of the City of Manila, Philippines. The Black Nazarene was carved by an unknown Mexican from a dark wood in the 16th century in Mexico, and then transported to the Philippines in 1606. It depicts Jesus en route to his crucifixion. Pope Innocent X granted recognition to the lay Confraternity of Santo Cristo Jes√∫s Nazareno in 1650 for the promotion of the devotion to Jesus through the icon. It was housed in several churches near Manila in the early decades, arriving in Quiapo Church in 1787 where it has been enshrined ever since. Tagalog Maharlika nobility depicts in the Boxer Codex. * Boxer Codex ‚Äì a manuscript written c. 1590, which contains illustrations of ethnic groups in the Philippines at the time of their initial contact with the Spaniards. Aside from a description of, and historical allusions to what is now the Philippines and various other Far Eastern countries, the codex also contains seventy-five coloured drawings of the inhabitants of these regions and their distinctive costume.. * Doctrina Christiana- an early book on the Roman Catholic Catechism, written in 1593 by Fray Juan de Plasencia, and is believed to be one of the earliest printed books in the Philippines. extant copies had been find ancient script translation along with the Spanish Latin content.

Calle Crisologo in Vigan at night. * City of Vigan Located on the western coast of the large island of Luzon, facing the South China Sea, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in that it is one of the few towns left in the Philippines whose old structures have mostly remained intact, and it is well known for its cobblestone streets and architecture of the Philippine colonial era which fuses Native Philippine and Oriental building designs and construction, with colonial Spanish architecture. Former Philippine president Elpidio Quirino, the sixth President of the Philippines, was born in Vigan, at the former location of the Provincial Jail (his father was a warden); he resided in the Syquia Mansion. In May 2015, Vigan City was officially recognized as one of the New7Wonders Cities together with Beirut, Doha, Durban, Havana, Kuala Lumpur and La Paz. New7Wonders Foundation president and founding member Bernard Weber led a ceremony held at St. Paul Cathedral where he handed a bronze plaque to Vigan Mayor Eva Grace Singson-Medina, signifying the heritage city's election as one of the world's wonder cities. * Banaue Rice Terraces- Initially believed to pre-date the arrival of the Spanish colonizers, recent scholarship has led scholars to conclude that the Banaue rice terraces were constructed in the 1650s, an indigenous response to Spanish colonial rule in the lowlands. American colonial period * The El Fraile Island (originally known as Fort Drum), which nicknamed as \\"the concrete battleship,\\" is a heavily fortified island situated at the mouth of Manila Bay in the Philippines, due south of Corregidor Island. The reinforced concrete fortress shaped like a battleship was built by the United States in 1909 as one of the harbor defenses at the wider South Channel entrance to the bay during the American colonial period. It was captured and occupied by the Japanese during World War II, and was recaptured by the U.S. after igniting petroleum and gasoline in the fort, leaving it permanently out of commission.U.S. Army (1916). \\"United States Military Reservations, National Cemeteries, and Military Parks\\", pg. 344.

Branching off from this main shaft are 13 lateral tunnels on the north side and 11 lateral tunnels on the south side. Each lateral averaged in length and in width. * The Pearl of Lao Tzu (also referred to as previously as Pearl of Allah) used to be the largest known pearl. The pearl was found in the Palawan sea, which surrounds the island of Palawan in the Philippines, and was found by a Filipino diver. It is not considered a gemstone pearl, but is instead known as a \\"clam pearl\\" or \\"Tridacna pearl\\" from a giant clam. It measures 24 centimeters in diameter (9.45 inches) and weighs 6.4 kilograms (14.2 lb). = Contemporary artifacts (1947 onwards) = * Macliing Dulag's door - The University of the Philippines Baguio's Museo Kordilyera has preserved the door of Kalinga protest leader Macliing Dulag's home, still ridden with bulletholes after the 4th Infantry Division of the Philippine Army opened fire on the house on 24 April 1980, killing Macliing Dulag and wounding a companion.Doyo, Ma.

She was the daughter of Cuncar, Mormaer of Angus, who was thought to be a descendant of Pictish royalty. Lady Finella is a well-known name that is rarely spelled the same way, and is also referred to as Fenella, Finuela, Finnguala, Fimberhele, Strath Finella, Strathfinella Hill, or Sibill, depending on the source. Most of her story is known through John of Fordun's chronicles written in the late 14th century, probably based on local, medieval folklore or 'feud-sagas'. He documented that Lady Finella's son was killed, most likely in battle, by Cinaed at Dunsinnan, a.k.a. Cinaed mac M√°el Couim (Kenneth II MacMalcolm, king of Alba (971-995).

However, the story is that to seek revenge, and with help from the king's men or Cinaed's rivals, Lady Finella created an elaborate death-trap at a cottage in Fettercairn then lured King Kenneth II inside when he was visiting the area. Inside, a statue of a boy stood in the center of the main room. Lady Finella said that if the king touched the boy's head it would lead to 'amazing sport'. When King Kenneth II pulled the statue's head towards him it triggered a series of crossbows throughout the space that sent a hail of arrows into the king. True or not, it is established that Kenneth II was killed in Fettercairn in 995. The story continues that Lady Finella fled towards the coast where she was pursued and cornered by the king's soldiers at the top of a waterfall near St Cyrus. To avoid capture, Lady Finella threw herself over the waterfall from a height of 150 feet to her death. The valley where this supposedly took place is called Den Finella.

In Australia and New Zealand, the brand is manufactured by Imperial Tobacco. The cigarette brand is named after Petrus Stuyvesant, Governor of New Amsterdam, later New York City. History The Peter Stuyvesant brand was initially launched in South Africa in 1954 and later test marketed in New York in 1957, the brand was officially launched worldwide in the same year. \\"The scent of the big wide world: Peter Stuyvesant.\\" is the famous slogan, which was created in 1958 by the Swiss Fritz B√ºhler. In the 1980s the slogan was changed to \\"The taste of the whole wide world.\\" British American Tobacco bought the brand in 2003. In the 1980s, the brand enjoyed an increase in sales thanks to various advertising campaigns in cinemas and by offering the cigarettes in the airplanes of the Dutch airline company KLM. The brand is sold in 55 countries and is especially popular in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, as well as most parts of Europe, but is less known in the United States. In 2015, a tax increase in Malaysia saw Peter Stuyvesant, as well as various other BAT branded cigarettes, increase in price. Peter Stuyvesant and Pall Mall cigarettes went from 12.30 to 15.50 Malaysian ringgit, an increase of 3.20 Malaysian ringgit.  Peter Stuyvesant Foundation  In 1960, the president of the Tobacco Company\\", decided to hang works of art above the machines of the Peter Stuyvesant factory in Zevenaar, the Netherlands. Over a period of thirty years, more than a thousand works by contemporary artists from thirty-seven countries have been collected. These works regularly circulated between the Amsterdam headquarters and the various factories around the world, in Spain, France, Italy and Switzerland. They were also shown in museums in the Netherlands and abroad. Starting in 1980, the Foundation offered the workers of the tobacco factory the opportunity to acquire original works in a limited edition of 100 copies. In 2010, the collection was dispersed.(fr) Delarge, Fondation Peter Stuyvesant .(nl)RKD, Le mus√©e dans l'usine : collection Peter Stuyvesant‚Äô‚Äô (nl)RKD, Peter Stuyvesant graphic art collection, 2002 Peter Stuyvesant Cultural Foundation : Australian Gallery File, on Trove-National Library of Australia.Colin Gleadell, Peter Stuyvesant art collection to be sold, 1 March 2010 on Telegraph.co.uk. The Zevenaar factory office has been granted the status of National Monument being one example of the building style Nieuwe Bouwen\\" of the interwar period. Since 2010 it's in use as the municipality hall of Zevenaar. One of the former production halls has been granted the status of Municipal Monument. Since 2015 it's in use as the Turmac Cultureel Centrum. The remaining buildings of the factory complex were demolished. On the terrain a new neighbourhood will arise, named \\"BAT\\" after the British American Tobacco Company, the last owner of the plant. Controversy In 2009, Imperial Tobacco Australia hosted a VIP party in a building owned by the South Australian state government, which funds anti- smoking campaigns, to promote its Peter Stuyvesant brand. The annual Peter Stuyvesant secret VIP party had become a legend among A-listers. Supposedly held in a different city every year, the party was labelled as one of the biggest and most lavish on the corporate calendar. The top-secret, invitation- only event was held in the Queen's Theatre, a non-smoking venue belonging to the History Trust of South Australia. Senator Nick Xenophon described the cigarette industry as \\"parasitic\\" and urged the government to cancel the event, but the state Substance Abuse Minister Jane Lomax-Smith said she would not \\"interfere\\" with the party. \\"While we are making life tougher for cigarette companies, we wouldn't interfere in the affairs of a legitimate business running a private function in a no-smoking venue,\\" she said. In 2016, it was reported that Imperial Tobacco Australia was selling cut-price premium brand cigarettes imported from Ukraine in various Coles, IGA and Foodworks stores for as low as 20 Australian Dollars a packet. Fairfax Media bought cigarettes from Imperial Tobacco's line of brands that were from two countries of origin - New Zealand and the Ukraine. The Ukrainian-made Imperial Tobacco cigarettes were between $3 and $6 cheaper than the company's cigarettes made in New Zealand, depending on the brand and the location of the store. The brand at the centre of the change was the popular, premium brand, Peter Stuyvesant Blues. The Ukrainian version was called \\"Peter Stuyvesant Originals Blue\\", while the NZ version was dubbed \\"Peter Stuyvesant Classic Blue\\". A spokeswoman for Imperial Tobacco claimed the company had changed its country of import to provide cut-price cigarettes to the Australian market. \\"The Ukraine-manufactured product is a brand extension. Our Ukrainian facility has the machinery necessary to manufacture this particular product. The balance of that brand family is manufactured in NZ,\\" she said. Also in 2016, Imperial Tobacco Australia deployed a new trick to circumvent the plain packaging legislation, by inserting soft packs inside hard packs, effectively allowing people to take the cigarettes out with the soft pack and throw away the hard pack which featured the required graphic pictorial warnings. That ruse was mainly used for Peter Stuyvesant cigarette packs. A spokeswoman for Imperial Tobacco denied the company was breaking the law before adding: \\"we are providing a fresher, premium product to consumers\\". It wasn't the first time Imperial Tobacco tried to circumvent these regulations. A report in 2011 by Quit Victoria mentioned the brand's previous behaviour, noting: \\"In February 2006, one month prior to the adoption of picture‚Äêbased warnings on tobacco packages, Peter Stuyvesant cigarettes were being sold in 'trendy retro‚Äêstyle tins' which, unlike soft packets of cigarettes with on‚Äêpack printed warnings, had health warning stickers that were easily peeled off. Retailers reported that the tins were very popular with younger smokers\\". In 2017, the Health Department conceded it would not be taking any action against Imperial Tobacco for breaching plain packaging legislation. Court action which could involve penalties of more than a million dollars imposed on the tobacco giant, but the Department chose to take what it called a \\"conciliatory\\" approach. Markets Peter Stuyvesant is or was sold in the following countries: Canada, United States, United Kingdom, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Belgium, The Netherlands, Germany, France, Austria, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, Czech Republic, Greece, Turkey, Senegal, Zambia, South Africa, Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand.

The species is sometimes called the \\"mopopaja tree\\". It is distributed throughout Northeast Africa to Arabia. Description Sterculia africana is a deciduous tree that grows up to 8m tall, it is monoecious, with a single trunk and rounded crown. S.africana has smooth and flaking bark that is grey or pinkish brown. The leaves alternate, crowded at the ends of branches, orbicular, 8‚Äì15 cm long x 8‚Äì15 cm across. Leaves are 3-5 lobed and covered in stellate hairs. Flowers appear before the leaves 1.5‚Äì2 cm across, in axillary panicles. Flowers are unisexual with both sexes being found on the same tree. They have no petals, but the calyx is coloured and functions as a corolla. In the male flowers the numerous anthers are fused together to form a column. The fruits consist of 3-5 spreading, ovoid lobes which split at maturity and are covered with dense golden hairs. The inside surface of the lobes contain small stinging hairs. Stercula africana sheds its leaves during the dry season and comes into flower before the leaves reappear at the start of the monsoon. Small quantities of resin ooze from the bark of the trunk and larger branches. Distribution and habitat Sterculia africana has been recorded in southeastern Egypt, Eastern Sudan, Ethiopia, Djibouti, northern Somalia, southern Tanzania, Mozambique, Malawi, eastern Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, and Namibia's Caprivi Strip. No subspecies are listed in the Catalogue of Life. Variety socotrana is endemic to the island of Socotra. Sterculia africana grows in dry woodlands on limestone escarpments and the sides of wadis usually at elevations of below 600m. Uses Resin was traditionally used as a washing agent in Arabia. The hardened resin was mixed with water or spittle and then rubbed over the body. It was also a treatment to treat head lice. It is an important fodder and the wood was used to make fishing platforms. Threats The current population is stable however as it is an important fodder for cattle, if the livestock populations increase, the tree would come under increasing threat.

Cuming spent his life building on the work of his father Richard Cuming (1777‚Äì1870), a collector from Walworth in South East London. Father and son were both fascinated by collecting things from the everyday lives of people all over the world, but Cuming's interests were more local than his father's, and he pursued them more seriously. Cuming collected thousands of objects from the ordinary lives of south Londoners in the 1800s, from theatre adverts and rail tickets, to cheap toys and good luck charms. His collection included thousands of ancient objects dug up by labourers building the canals, docks and railways that profoundly changed London in the 18th and 19th centuries. Personal life Born in 1817, Cuming was the second son of Richard Cuming Jr., and his wife Anne Warner (died 1853). Cuming lived with his parents and sister, Ann Bagwell Cuming (died 1893), first at 3 Dean's Row just off Walworth Road, and then 63 Kennington Park Road. Neither Henry nor Ann married, and all four lived together amicably until their various deaths. Cuming's elder brother, Richard Howton Cuming (died 1887) was disinherited by his father for marrying a Catholic; thus Cuming inherited his father's collection. The Cumings enjoyed a comfortable existence and had sufficient funds and leisure for at least three generations of gentlemanly (and ladylike) pursuits. Shadwell forgeries During Cuming's lifetime the growing antiques market trade was flooded with fakes which Cuming enjoyed collecting and exposing. In 1858, Cuming exposed what became known as the Shadwell forgeries, or the Billy and Charley fraud, at a meeting of the British Archaeological Association. This fraud, perpetuated by two Londoners, William (Billy) Smith and Charles (Charley) Eaton, involved the production of lead medallions, which the fraudsters then claimed to have found at Shadwell dock. Cuming's lecture was reported in The Athenaeum and The Gentleman's Magazine, causing a drastic reduction in sales of the medallions. Outraged, George Eastwood sued The Athenaeum for libel, but the judge found for the defendant; Cuming wrote \\"We gained a glorious victory\\". However, Smith and Eaton continued to sell their forgeries, and improved on their production process by making more delicate medals using cock metal, a copper and lead alloy, rather than lead alone. In 1964, Cuming again lectured to the British Archaeological Association regarding these forgeries; a year later, the value of the forgeries had declined so much so that Cuming was able to acquire them for a penny. Career and legacy Cuming was a member of the British Archaeological Association from its formation in 1843, becoming secretary in 1856, and later, vice president. He edited the association's journal for several years, and gave lectures and published articles on the history of subjects ranging from slings to mistletoe. In 1867, Cuming became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. Cuming wrote extensively, providing a fascinating picture of a man obsessed with detail, with an eye for then-ordinary things which have become extraordinary to us today and with a great breadth of interest. He also created beautiful drawings of his objects, although he was not as well regarded as his fine amateur artist uncle John Brompton Cuming. When Cuming died on 7 October 1902, he left the family's collection of 100,000 objects to the then parish of St Mary Newington, with the sum of ¬£8,000 and instructions that the parish should open a museum bearing the family name. An addition was built onto the Newington Library building, and the museum was opened on 10 October 1906 by Lord Rothschild. Due to the wide array of items displayed, the Cuming Museum was billed upon opening as the \\"British Museum in miniature\\".

Conquest The conquest of the former province of Corsica and Sardinia by the Vandals occurred between 456 and 476. The first occupation took place in 456 AD. It was a partial, limited and short-lived occupation of some coastal cities. In 466 the Roman general Marcellinus ‚Äì possibly encouraged by Pope Hilarius ‚Äì succeeded in regaining control of the island. However, between 474 and 482 Sardinia fell again under the rule of the Vandals, perhaps led by Genseric or his son Huneric. During these campaigns, Olbia, one of the most prosperous Sardinian cities, was violently attacked in the sea and its port destroyed. The possession of Sardinia guaranteed the Vandals secure maritime trade routes between North Africa and the rest of the Mediterranean. The island became the frontier of the Vandal Kingdom and assumed an important strategic role. Vandal administration The Vandal administrative system did not differ much from that of the Roman period. Sardinia was overseen by a governor called a praeses, chosen from the trusted men of the royal family and resident in Caralis, who had both civil and military functions. He was assisted by a multitude of auxiliary officials including procurators, tax collectors, and conductors (real estate economists). The island territory was subdivided into many parts that were assigned partially to the crown and partially to the Vandal warriors. The Sardinian-Roman landowners managed to keep their lands in certain cases, in exchange for the payment of lump sums. Barbagia, the central-eastern mountain area of the island, remained a semi-independent duchy, as it had been in the Roman period and would remain in the first part of the Byzantine period. At the end of Vandal era groups of Mauri, who were sent to the island by the Vandals, took refuge in the mountains of Barbagia or Gerrei. From here they made raids against the Forum Traiani (Fordongianus) during the Byzantine period. The Byzantine General Solomon organized a military expedition against them in the winter of 537. =Godas rebellion= Vandal coin found in Sardinia depicting Godas. Latin legend: REX CVDA. In 533, perhaps taking advantage of a remarkable autonomy, Godas, the Vandal governor of Goth origin, proclaimed himself king of the island, minting his own bronze coins. Justinian, Emperor of the East, purportedly to help Godas, decided to intervene and sent an army commanded by General Belisarius and assisted by Duke Cirillus. The Byzantine force led by Belisarius was made up of 16,000 soldiers and 600 ships and headed to Africa while Duke Cyril with some 400 ships headed for Caralis. Vandalic War campaign map Meanwhile, the King of Vandals, Gelimer, who was also facing a revolt in Tripoli, sent his brother Tzazo with a large contingent of 120 ships and 5,000 men to Sardinia to suppress Goda's uprising. Tzazo quickly took Caralis (where he left a small contingent), executed Godas and returned immediately to Carthage where the Byzantines had landed. Belisarius had defeated Gelimero on August 30, 533 and occupied Carthage. He was followed by Cirillus, who had failed to reach Sardinia. Tzazo and Gelimer, together with what remained of the army, marched against the Byzantines but were defeated at the Battle of Tricamarum, from Carthage. Tzazo was killed while Gelimero, escaping capture, surrendered a few months later. Cirillus then went to Calaris where he showed Tzazo's head impaled on a pike to the Vandals of the garrison, who immediately surrendered. Thus the Vandal era in Sardinia ended in 534 and the Byzantine period began. Religion The Sardinian dioceses of the Roman periodCaralis, Forum Traiani, Sulci, Turris and Sanafer (and perhaps Cornus)remained operative under the Vandals. The Sardinian church was not persecuted and was not forced into Arianism. African Catholic bishops under the Vandals were persecuted and exiled to Sardinia during periods of the most severe oppression of Catholics by Vandals. This had some positive consequences for Sardinia, because the exiles enriched the cultural and religious life during their presence, for example importing monasticism. Among the bishops deported to the island by the Vandals were the bishop of Carthage, Fulgentius of Ruspe, and Felicianis, bishop of Hippo, who carried with him the relics of Augustine of Hippo (now preserved in Pavia). It was in this period that two Sardinians ascended to the papal throne: Pope Hilarius and Pope Symmachus. Culture =Funeral architecture= Paleochristian area of Cornus Vandal funerary practices have been documented by the presence of some necropolis and single burials brought to light in several island locations. The most significant information comes from the Cornus-Columbaris necropolis, which consists of 22 tombs where numerous finds from a mixed German-African matrix have been made. The funeral area of Sant'Imbenia at Alghero, the burial in Spina Santa near Sassari, and the tomb discovered at Sant'Antioco, where a man was buried with his horse, also appear to belong to the Vandal age.A cura di Silvia Lusuardi Siena, Fonti archeologiche e iconografiche per la storia e la cultura degli insediamenti nell'Altomedievo (2003) pp. 306‚Äì310 The historian Alberto Boscolo attributed to the Vandals the tombs with barrel vaults discovered in several island resorts, mainly in southern Sardinia. The scholar identified them as Germanic elite graves but according to other scholars they would instead be placed in the Byzantine period.Paolo Benito Serra, Tombe a camera in muratura con volta a botte nei cimiteri altomedievali della Sardegna(1987), p.140 =Clothing= In the Vandal era, some innovations were introduced to the island with regard to clothing. These include fibulae, buckles, and jewellery such as polyhedron earrings originating in the Germanic area.

Branches existed in Athens, Thessaloniki, Volos and Patras. It had the monopoly on the foreign trade of Greece from October 1942 onwards. It was the main vehicle for the economic exploitation of Greece by Nazi Germany until the withdrawal of German troops in October 1944. History =Background= Following the German invasion of Greece and the start of the occupation, the German authorities initially employed the Bank of Greece to extract material and financial assets, as well as to gather occupation costs. The latter were the highest among the various territories occupied by Nazi Germany. The first measure taken was the altering of the exchange rate from 1:50 to 1:60 in clearing transactions, and the compulsory involvement of the Bank of Greece in the export of Greek goods to Germany. For each export, the Bank was obliged to transfer the value of the goods to an escrow account in Berlin, to the benefit of the German importer, and simultaneously pay the producer for the goods. In essence, the Bank of Greece, thereby granted temporary loans to the German merchants. Since prices were fixed at pre-war levels, and payment was dropped for any delayed delivery of the goods (which occurred frequently due to wartime conditions), the importers accumulated considerable profits at the expense of the producers. Following the confiscation of goods by the occupation authorities,p. 366 the local producers in Greece were forced to switch from an export-oriented economy to a subsistence economy, so that no more material assets could be extracted. At the same time the occupation authorities exported a large number of raw materials like iron ore, copper, or resins, as well as foodstuffs, which resulted in the Great Famine, particularly in the winter of 1941‚Äì42. In addition, in order to facilitate the extraction of assets, the amount of banknotes in circulation was increased, so that the Greek drachma soon lost its value through hyperinflation. = Establishment and operation of DEGRIGES = After all extant assets were exhausted, on 1 October 1942 the Deutsch-Griechische Warenausgleichsgesellschaft mbH (DEGRIGES) was established, headquartered in Berlin. The initiative lay with the Reich Finance Ministry, with the participation of the Reich economy groups for Trade and Industry, and the Bulk and Export Trade economy group.Klara van Eyll, Ulrike Duda, Gesellschaft f√ºr Unternehmensgeschichte: Deutsche Wirtschaftsarchive: Best√§nde von Unternehmen, p. 220, 1991 The formally private enterprise possessed a state foreign trade monopoly. The collaborationist government sent Konstantinos Logothetopoulos as negotiator.Heinz A. Richter, Komnƒìnos Pyromaglou: Griechenland zwischen Revolution und Konterrevolution (1936-1946), p. 198 Otto Braun (the owner of the Transdanubia trade company) became the company's first director. A branch office was located in Berlin, led by Fred Goecker, vice-chairman of the German chamber of commerce in Greece, as well as another in Thessaloniki. Corresponding offices were opened in Patras and Volos. From 15 October 1942 it was controlled by Hermann Neubacher, the former mayor of Vienna and Reich plenipotentiary in the Balkans, and particularly \\"Reich Special Envoy for Economic and Financial Issues in Greece\\".Susanne Heim: Geschichte der Kaiser- Wilhelm-Gesellschaft im Nationalsozialismus,p. 219 The company began operations on 28 November, and a few days later the Bank of Greece was forced to hand over its foreign exchange reserves to the German Reich in the form of a compulsory loan; by the end of the war, the loan amounted to 476 million Reichsmark.Stellungnahme der Deutschen Bundesregierung vom 11. Februar 2010 (PDF; 113 kB) Following the departure of most German troops from Greece in October 1944, on 8 December 1944 DEGRIGES was dissolved.Ulrike Duda: Best√§nde von Unternehmen, Unternehmern, Kammern und Verb√§nden, p. 220 1992. Mission and impact The company levied surcharges on all Greek export goods, which were used to 4/7 to lower prices for German importers, and to 3/7 to service the occupation costs. Exports of goods from Greece were considerably reduced in price and prices for German goods imported to Greece were greatly increased. This brought exceptional advantages for the German economy, euphemistically termed \\"lockage profits\\" (Schleusungsgewinne). Through such policies of extreme price manipulation the company succeeded in overturning the considerable trade deficit between the two countries‚Äîdespite the wholesale confiscation of Greek products and the imposition of occupation costs, the trade balance in 1942 was 71 million Reichsmark in favour of Greece, but suddenly reached 20 million Reichsmark in favour of Germany in 1943.Martin Seckendorf: Zur Wirtschaftspolitik der deutschen Besatzer in Griechenland 1941-1944. Ausbeutung, die in die Katastrophe m√ºndete. Edited version of a presentation held on 3 December 2005 at a symposium of the Athens University of Economics and Business over the reparations of Greek victims of the German occupation; hosted by the Berliner Gesellschaft f√ºr Faschismus- und Weltkriegsforschung e.V. German interest was mainly focused on raw materials, which were increasingly needed as the war went on; in addition, since machinery and tools had been shipped to Germany, few finished products could be produced locally. Thus between may 1941 and November 1944, tons of chromium were transported to Germany, covering about a quarter of the total requirements of the German war economy during the war.

Language The Koamu language, often classified as a dialect of Bidjara, appeared to be quite similar to that spoken by the Ualarai, and some early ethnographers such as R. H. Mathews confused the two for this reason. Country The Koamu are estimated to have ranged over of tribal territory. They were on the Balonne River starting south of St. George, as far as Angledool, Hebei, and Brenda. Their western terrain extended to Bollon and Nebine Creek. Dirranbandi also was part of their territory. According to Thomas Honery, an authority on the nearby Weilwan, the Koamu also lived around the Warrego. This was rejected by Norman Tindale as beyond their western frontier. Mythology On dying, a Koamu is met on passing into the spirit world by his yuri or totem, who then reintroduces him to all of his relations, the natural species belonging to his moiety.

It stars Zahid Ahmed and Armeena Khan. Daldal reflects on the evil practices of society that continue to this day.https://www.hipinpakistan.com/news/1152575  Plot  The story revolves around the themes of illegal immigration, dowry and corruption (greed). Shuja (Zahid Ahmed), a member of a lower-middle-class family, dreams of going to London one day in order to escape his current unsatisfactory life. Shuja's mother, Sakeena (Asma Abbas) is a very greedy person, and wants Shuja to marry a rich woman who'd be able to shower Shuja and his family with buckets of money. Shuja, however marries Hira (Armeena Khan), his maternal cousin, with ulterior motives of getting to London through her father, who lives and works there. Although Shuja's decision to marry Hira, is not exactly based on romances initially but him and Hira gradually develop a mutual understanding and deep love for each other over the course of their marriage. Eventually, after a lot of ups and downs, her father finally agrees and gives the news of Shuja's immigration. With a sudden turn of events, day later, Hira's father passes away, because of which Shuja's immigration is inevidently cancelled and he's left hopeless, his hopelessness boiling up frustration minute by minute. With no other choice in mind, the young lad then decides to travel illegally, by hook or by crook. Whilst travelling illegally, Shuja faces a lot of difficult obstacles. It takes a long time to get to London, with many trivial challenges in between, first he goes from Karachi to Iran, then to Turkey, then Greece, then France and finally he arrives at his true destination, London. Shuja, without any other option available to him, has to travel and cannot turn back, or else he shall face death from starvation and other struggles. Shuja travels with a group of men and they all walk from one country to another, thirsty, hungry and very stressed. Unable to quench their thirst or satisfy their hunger, they are threatened by the leader of their association to call their parents and demand for money or else they'll have to die. When the group becomes fully aware of the threatening situations they put themselves in, it is then that they begin to realise, that they must continue and keep on walking, because these terrible circumstances have been brought on to them and have been woven by their own hands. Hiding in lorries and vans, walking miles and more, the group fakes their identity the entire way, knowing fully well what'd happen if they didn't. When the men arrive in Turkey, they are given some food, water and clothes, much to their happiness. Their names are changed and they are given fake passports to continue on faking their identities, this was an extremely important factor that had to be dealt with carefully, otherwise their safety would be at risk and they'd immediately be exposed and deported. With very little understanding of how the world works, Shuja believes that in the West, money grows on trees whilst in the East, it has to be earned with hard work and labour. Contrary to Shuja's personality, his younger brother, Kamran's (Muneeb Butt) ideals are completely opposite to that of his. Kamran works hard and honestly, and despite of his family's circumstances and his younger age, Kamran succeeds far more than Shuja. In due, Shuja and the rest of the men reach Greece, day by day getting closer to their actual destination. Since there was, of course, no source of shelter, the illegal bunch stays in a container for some days. While staying there, Shuja witnesses an untimely death of a woman who had been living in the container for more than 10 days. This makes Shuja extremely terrified and also causes him to feel depressed, his patience at its limit. Meanwhile, in Pakistan, Kamran is offered a visit to Qatar for some days and is in the midst of marrying a girl named Sania (Kinza Hashmi), whose first marriage had been broken off when the groom and his family left because of Sania's father's arrest. Out of sympathy and care for Sania's reputation, Kamran marries her, so that he could save her from a lifetime of insult and mockery. With a head full of ambitions, Kamran's greedy mother is completely unwilling to marry her son off to someone of the same social status, however his father is extremely pleased with his empathetic and respectful decision. Shuja finally reaches France. In Pakistan it was heard a truck carrying a container with illegal immigrants like Shuja was fired by soldiers. This makes Shuja's family sad and hopeless. Kamran later discovers from the embassy that Shuja is not dead. In France, Shuja gets in a fight with one of the immigrants who was encouraging him to stay in France and do something better here and forget about London. Shuja later apologizes him and the immigrant told him three only ways to get to UK. The first is to go by ferry but you can be easily discovered and be thrown in the sea, the second is to go by walk, which can result in death by a shot from a gun at the border and the third is to travel by hanging under a trailer leaving for London. Shuja chooses the third way because it is impossible to be spotted. Shuja hangs under a food truck and leaves for London. Shuja finally reaches the destination he longed for, London. He is amazed by the scenery and calls home. His mother receives the call. Shuja later realizes there is nothing to do really here is no one will offer a job because he is illegal. Shuja then meets a man who offers him a job at a hotel for a 1,000 pounds a month. He later realizes the person who applied him the job is trying to use him for something illegal. He leaves him and sleeps in a park. In Pakistan, Kamran is leaving for his flight to Qatar. He hands over some money to Hira because his mother doesn't even allow her to eat a decent amount of food. Sakeena scolds Kamran for not giving her money, but he ignores. In London Shuja cannot find a job and after meeting another Pakistani at a grocery store, he realizes to get a job you need legal documents. He is hopeless and realizes that coming here was a big mistake. Sakeena is very angry at Kamran for leaving her like this and getting married with a middle- class family girl. She wanted someone from a rich family to fulfill her greed. She calls up her friend and finds a family and tells them that Kamran is unmarried. Sania hears the news and is angry to Kamran. Meanwhile, in London, Shuja tries to find a job but fails. Shuja also gets very hungry in the process. Since he has no money he cannot buy anything. He spots a workshop and mechanics trying to get tires inside the workshop. He offers them a help and he is paid 5 pounds and buys some food with it. In Pakistan, Kamran hears about a marriage proposal her mother did. He returns and meets Sania first and assures her he will never leave her. Then he goes back home asks his mother about the proposal and his mother is shocked because she kept it a secret. For the first time, Kamran's father scolds her and warns that if she does this again, she will be kicked out of the house. In London, Shuja is still trying to find a job. He finally succeeds when he finds a job at a local restaurant owned by a Sikh. He gets a job for 200 pounds a month and is given an apartment but to his dismay, the apartment was already being lived by four other men and the whole building only contained one single bathroom. He soon settles in. The first day of the job did not go well though. Due to being only one bathroom in the building he had to stand In a long queue. He arrived 10 minutes late at his job and 30 pounds were cut from his salary. Soon he also breaks a dish which angers the owner. Shuja soon discovers that the Sikh was also selling drugs secretly. Shuja could not report this to authorities because if they ask his identity he would be captured. So he moves on and tries to fit in his new life. The scolding Sakeena received did not stop her from trying to separate the couple. She goes to a Black Magician and is given a curse written on a paper. The Magician told here to drop the paper in a glass of water then give it to Kamran. Sania's servant was also present at that time. She reports Sania and then she calls Kamran. Kamran then caught her mother trying to keep the piece of paper in a cup of tea. Hira is still trying to spend life without Shuja as she is always being badly treated by Sakeena. Sakeena took away here phone and often scolds her for no apparent reason. Disturbed by all of this, Hira stays with her mother for some time. When Kamran comes back from work, his mother is quite questionable to him and asking him how his day is at work while she goes to the kitchen and distracts Tamana (sister) who is getting tea for her brother that Mubashir is crying and she should go to him. Sakina starts doing what the Black Magician told her but Kamran fortunately comes and spots her. He tells his mom this is wrong but he says that if you want me to drink it then fine but he believes in his God that nothing will happen. Sakina says a lie that this paper is not a curse but for him for his success and health. But Kamran knows the truth and doesn't want to embarrass his mother. Eventually, Shuja realises his mistakes. His tone towards Hira (his wife) is much softer and loving than before. He is very guilty and angry at himself for coming to London because even though his hardworking father has educated him, he cannot get a good job better than the one he has now simply because he has no documents for evidence. Shuja's friend advises him to take another part-time job in the bar with him and so Shuja does. But one day a British friend of his (more like a colleague) forces him to drink and so he gets drunk. Shuja desperately insists he doesn't want to because it is haram in his faith which means it is forbidden to drink in his faith but the person says that if he wants to work in a pub and make drinks, he needs to drink himself. Meanwhile, a Sikh girl called Preet who protected Shuja in the pub once starts a liking for Shuja. She comes to the pub follows him to the restaurant and gives tips to him and pays the Sikh boss of Shuja for him to be out of work for some time. She is a very wealthy person herself and lives on her own. Shuja's friend advises him to take advantage of this as she wants to marry him and if they paper marry Shuja will become legal. However Shuja doesn't want to because he already has a wife. However, for papers Shuja marries Preet and Preet is somewhat overcontrolling over Shuja; refusing to let him send money back to Pakistan. He eventually calms her but a new dilemma arises - Hira has lost it. Constant breakdowns and uncontrollable anger have drove Sakina crazy and Kamran is taking care of her. She finds out Shuja got married again to Preet. She has lost it with Shuja and his family. Hira's mom tells Hira to give Shuja a divorce, because she says according to her experience they never come back once they go abroad and you are never happy. Shuja is unhappy and depressed with his London life and someone takes Shuja to Faraz - who was assumed dead but he really isn't. He tells Shuja that he told people he was dead because he was involved in illegal drugs and did not want to hurt anyone in his family. He tells Shuja to go back. Shuja is sent back to Pakistan and reaches the divorce court in time, where Hira withdraws her divorce and they live happily ever after.

Wheeler (born December 23, 1964) is an American attorney and serves as the 15th administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). He served as the deputy administrator from April to July 2018, and served as the acting administrator from July 2018 to February 2019. He previously worked in the law firm Faegre Baker Daniels, representing coal magnate Robert E. Murray and lobbying against the Obama Administration's environmental regulations. Wheeler served as chief counsel to the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works and to the chairman U.S. senator James Inhofe, prominent for his rejection of climate change. Wheeler is a critic of limits on greenhouse gas emissions and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In October 2017, Wheeler was nominated by President Donald Trump, renominated in January 2018, and confirmed as Deputy Administrator of the EPA in April 2018. On July 9, 2018, Wheeler became the acting administrator following the resignation of Scott Pruitt. On November 16, 2018, President Trump announced he would nominate Wheeler to serve as the EPA's permanent administrator. He was confirmed for the position by a 52‚Äì47 vote in the Senate on February 28, 2019. Early life and education Wheeler was born in Hamilton, Ohio, on December 23, 1964.He is an Eagle Scout. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree, with majors in English and biology, from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1987; and a Juris Doctor degree from the Washington University in St. Louis School of Law, in 1990. In 1998, he completed a Master of Business Administration degree at George Mason University. Career =EPA= Wheeler's first job between 1991 and 1995 was as special assistant to the Information Management Division director in the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics working on toxic chemical, pollution prevention, and right-to-know issues. Wheeler received the Agency's Bronze Medal in 1993 and twice in 1994. =Senate staff= From January 1995 until January 1997, Wheeler worked as Chief Counsel of Senator Jim Inhofe. In 1997, Wheeler entered his first work in Congress as majority staff director at the US Senate Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate Change, Wetlands, and Nuclear Safety, which Inhofe chaired until 2001; thereafter he was minority staff director under Chairman George Voinovich from 2001 to 2003. From 2003 to 2009, he was chief counsel at the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. During this time, Wheeler generally sought to reduce government regulations on industries that generate greenhouse gases. Senator James Inhofe was prominent for his rejection of climate change, and famously brought a snowball to the Senate as alleged proof that climate change was not real. During his time at the Senate, Wheeler was named by the National Journal as one of the Top Congressional Staff Leaders in 2005 and was a John C. Stennis Congressional Staff Fellow in the 106th Congress. =Lobbyist= From 2009 until 2017, Wheeler was a lobbyist in the law firm Faegre Baker Daniels' energy and natural resources practice. Since 2009, he represented the coal producer Murray Energy, privately owned by Robert E. Murray, a supporter of President Trump. Murray Energy was Wheeler's best-paying client, paying at least $300,000, and possibly as much as $3,300,000 during the period 2009-2017. Wheeler lobbied against the Obama administration's climate regulations for power plants and also sought to persuade the Energy Department to subsidize coal plants. Wheeler set up a meeting between Murray and Energy Secretary Rick Perry in March 2017; at the meeting, Murray advocated for the rollback of environmental regulations and for protections for the coal industry. =EPA deputy administrator= In October 2017, Wheeler was nominated by President Trump to become Deputy Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. His nomination was returned to the White House on January 3, 2018 as the Senate had adjourned at the end of 2017 without taking up the nomination (Senate Rule XXXI, paragraph 6). His nomination was resubmitted and he was confirmed as Deputy Administrator of the EPA on April 12, 2018, by a mostly party-line vote of 53‚Äì45, which included three Democratic senators: Joe Manchin, Heidi Heitkamp, and Joe Donnelly. Since being sworn in, Wheeler has had at least three meetings with former lobbying clients of his in a potential violation of the Trump administration's ethics pledge and the promises that Wheeler made during his confirmation hearing. Justina Fugh, an EPA ethics official, said that Wheeler's meetings with former lobbying clients did not violate the Trump administration's ethics pledge, because Wheeler had not worked on their behalf in the two years prior to joining the EPA. Vermont senator Bernie Sanders said he was \\"vigorously opposed\\" to Wheeler replacing Pruitt. =EPA acting administrator= Scott Pruitt announced on July 5, 2018, he would be resigning effective July 6. He left Wheeler as the acting head of the agency. On October 14, 2018, The New York Times published an op-ed against Wheeler's proposal to denigrate the public health benefits of reducing air pollution, aimed at a 2011 Obama administration finding that saw this as an asset to any information in controlling a particular pollutant. Later, on November 16, 2018, Wheeler was nominated to be Administrator of the EPA, after being deputy administrator for five months. In 2018, after a National Climate Assessment report about the impact of climate change in the United States was released by the Trump administration (which had been in the works for several years, stretching into the Obama presidency), the EPA under Wheeler's tenure dismissed the report's findings. The EPA falsely claimed that the Obama administration had pushed the authors of the report to focus on the worst-case scenario. In doing so, the EPA cited a story by the Daily Caller, a conservative website founded by Fox News pundit Tucker Carlson. FactCheck.Org wrote about the Daily Caller story that there was no evidence for the claims made, the report focused both on lower and higher scenarios, and much of the report looked at climate change impacts that had already occurred. FactCheck.Org noted that the report underwent multiple reviews, both internally and externally, and that the report was available for public review for three months. The Daily Caller cited as evidence for its claims a memo that allegedly showed that the Obama administration pushed the authors of the report to include worst-case scenarios; FactCheck.Org noted the memo \\"does not show that the Obama administration pushed for certain scenarios\\". Asked in November 2018 to name three EPA policies that had contributed to cleaner air, Wheeler struggled to answer, and two of his three answers were about rollbacks of Obama administration policies intended to curb pollution. =EPA administrator= Wheeler speaks in September 2019. Wheeler's nomination to become head of the EPA was confirmed by the Senate in a 52‚Äì47 vote in February 2019, in a largely party-line vote. In 2019, Wheeler argued in favor of a proposed EPA rule that would prohibit the EPA from using studies that do not make raw data publicly available, a rule first proposed under Wheeler's predecessor, Scott Pruitt. Wheeler framed the proposal as a \\"transparency\\" rule; scientists opposed the rule, stating that it would seriously limit the research available to the EPA, because studies do not tend to make personal and confidential information available. The proposal could prevent EPA from using many important studies underpinning various regulations, including regulations on air pollution. The proposed rule was denounced by 69 scientific and medical groups (including the American Lung Association, American Medical Association, and American Psychological Association) and the editors of five leading scientific journals (Nature, Cell, PLOS One, and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences). A bipartisan group of former EPA administrators, testifying before the House Energy Subcommittee on Oversight, also criticized proposals to restrict the use of science in EPA decision making. The EPA's Science Advisory Board also pushed back against the proposal. In arguing in favor of the proposed rule, Wheeler called on the EPA to use the kind of double-blind studies the FDA uses. This assertion was criticized by the Union of Concerned Scientists, which described Wheeler's comment as \\"breath-takingly ignorant\\" because double-blind studies (study designs in which \\"both researchers and study subjects don't know which subjects are given the placebo versus the treatment\\") are possible in drug trials but are infeasible in most of the kind of research the EPA does, i.e. measuring environmental impact. In March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the EPA declared that for an indefinite amount of time, it would generally not fine companies for violating environment regulations for \\"routine compliance monitoring [of pollution], integrity testing, sampling, laboratory analysis, training, and reporting or certification obligations\\", if the EPA agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic caused the violation. Wheeler said that the EPA \\"recognizes challenges resulting from efforts to protect workers and the public from Covid-19 may directly impact the ability of regulated facilities to meet all federal regulatory requirements.\\" In April 2020, the EPA declined to raise environmental standards for fine soot pollution (PM 2.5), during a mandated review. A draft scientific assessment by the EPA had estimated that the current standards (12 micrograms per cubic meter) were \\"associated with 45,000 deaths\\" per year, but if the standards were raised (9 micrograms per cubic meter), then 12,150 lives would be saved. Companies from many industries, producing fossil fuels, automobiles and chemicals, requested that the Trump administration ignore these findings and avoid raising standards. After the publication of that report, numerous industries, including oil and coal companies, automakers and chemical manufacturers, urged the Trump administration to disregard the findings and not tighten the rule. The draft of the new rule stated Wheeler placed \\"little weight on quantitative estimates\\" of deaths caused by fine soot pollution, reported the New York Times. Also in April 2020, the EPA weakened mercury regulation in the United States by drastically curtailing the health benefits considered in calculations for making future regulations. Wheeler declared that this was a \\"honest accounting method\\", while the Trump administration took the stance that mercury cleanup was not \\"appropriate and necessary\\". =Environmental views= Wheeler published articles in the magazine Law360. In 2010, he questioned the scientific rigor of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, expressing his impression that the positions of the organization were based more on political worldview than scientific facts. When asked if he accepted the scientific consensus on climate change during his confirmation hearings as Deputy Director of the EPA, Wheeler answered, \\"I believe that man has an impact on the climate but what's not completely understood is what the impact is.\\" In March 2019, Wheeler said he did not believe climate change was an existential threat. His remarks came in the wake of an IPCC report which concluded that if greenhouse gas emissions were not halved by 2030, there would be catastrophic consequences. Wheeler is Chairman Emeritus of the National Energy Resources Organization. He is Vice President of the Washington Coal Club.

This ended the Vandal dominion of the island after about 80 years. There was still a substantial continuity with the Roman phase at this time. The invasion of Italy by the Longobards in 568, which changed the face of Italy, only resulted in a few coastal raids on Sardinia. Administration Pluteus with Hippogriff and Pegasus. Museo archeologico nazionale (Cagliari) The Byzantine Empire was an autocratic state, with its administration centralised around the Emperor. In addition to being the chief of the army he also had authority in the Church, often appointing the Ecumenical Patriarch. Following the Byzantine reconquest, Sardinia was part of the praetorian prefecture of Africa. The province of Sardinia was ruled by a praeses provinciae, also known as the iudex provinciae, based in Cagliari. A dux was responsible for military matters and was based at Fordongianus (Forum Traiani), which since Roman times had been a fortified bastion against the inhabitants of the Barbagia. These two most important offices, iudex and dux, were unified in the 7th century. To allow for control of the routes that crossed the Tyrrhenian Sea, the island was also home to a squadron of the Byzantine fleet. Units of the Byzantine field army, the comitatenses, were based at Fordongianus. Along the border with the Barbagia region were fortresses such as those at Austis, Samugheo, Nuragus and Armungia. Soldiers of different origins, (Germanics, Balkan, Longobards and Avars among others), called limitanei (border troops) were garrisoned here. Some of the island's garrison soldiers were caballarii (horsemen) and received in compensation for their military services land parcels to farm.

They worked the private and community lands with hoes and nail plows, grazed livestock and fished. Extensive vineyards were cultivated but there seemed to have been few orchards. =End of Byzantine rule= Basilica of San Saturnino, Cagliari Sardinia was initially constituted as a ducatus (duchy) within the Exarchate of Africa. After the fall of the African Exarchate in the 7th century, caused by the Arab conquest of Carthage, the ducatus was directly dependent on Constantinople. It became then an archontate; that is, a region with the same characteristics of a theme but smaller and less rich. The governors of the island originally held the rank of hypatos and later that of protospatharios, before receiving the title of patrikios from the middle of the ninth century.Storia della marineria bizantina, pp. 85‚Äì86 At this time the relations with Byzantium, if not completely interrupted, had become intermittent, however.Gian Giacomo Ortu, La Sardegna dei Giudici, 2005 p.45-46 Due to Saracen attacks, in the 9th century Tharros was abandoned in favor of Oristano, after more than 1,800 years of human occupation while Caralis was abandoned in favor of Santa Igia; numerous other coastal centres suffered the same fate (Nora, Sulci, Bithia, Cornus, Bosa, Olbia among others.). Contacts between Sardinia and the Byzantine empire didn't cease, however, as suggested by the mention of Sardinian imperial guards in Costantine VII's work \\"De Caereimoniis\\" (956-959 AD) The Sardinian archon had both military and civil functions. During the period of direct Byzantine rule these were delegated to two different officers, the dux and the praeses. The office of archon became the prerogative of a specific family who transmitted the title in succession from father to a son. At the beginning of the 11th century there was a single archon for the whole island. This situation changed over the following decades; the first unequivocal attestation of the existence in Sardinia of four separate kingdoms is in the letter of October14, 1073 that Pope Gregory VII (1073‚Äì1085) sent from Capua to Orzocco of Cagliari, Orzocco d'Arborea, Marianus of Torres and Constantine of Gallura.Gian Giacomo Ortu, La Sardegna dei Giudici, 2005 p.45 During the early Giudicati era the Giudicato of Cagliari were direct descendants of the former Archontate of Sardinia. They helped many Byzantine institutions, including the Byzantine Greek language, to survive.SardegnaCultura.it, Le iscrizioni greco-bizantine By the end of the century Greek had been supplanted by Medieval Latin and Sardinian. Religion Church of Nostra Segnora de Mesumundu, Siligo Church of Santa Sabina in front of the homonym nuraghe, Silanus The Sardinian Church followed the Eastern Rite, in which baptism and confirmation were imparted together. Baptism was carried out by submersion in tanks where water came to the knees of the catechumens. Similar baptismal tanks are found in Tharros, Dolianova, Nurachi, Cornus and Fordongianus. Alongside the secular clergy operated the Basilian monks, who spread Christianity in Barbagia. In the Byzantine period several cross-in-square churches were erected, with the four arms around a domed roof over their junction.

Sardinia Category:Medieval Sardinia ","title":"Byzantine Sardinia"},{"id":"55025328","text":"Oktonia is a hillside village found in the east-central area of Evia Island, belonging to the Municipality of Kimi-Aliveri, Greece. Located near the lower side of the Gulf of Kimi, the village is composed of four communities, Alonia, Panochori (the upper village), Katochori (the lower village) and Panagia, covering a large area. It is 145 km from Athens, a distance covered in about 2.5 hours by car, making it a destination for both winter and summer holidays. According to the census of 2011, Oktonia has 455 permanent inhabitants. Including the coastal communities of Agios Mercurios and Mourteri, the population is 650.  History and Origins of Oktonia  The area of Oktonia has been inhabited since antiquity. The geographer Strabon (64 or 63 BC-c. 24 AD) wrote about Ochalia,a settlement apparently in the same location according to many scholars. Research indicates that there was a temple dedicated to Chthonia Demetra, the goddess Demetra who was the protector of the earth (chthon), and more specifically, agriculture and agricultural production. From a compilation of historical data and traditional legend, it appears that during the late Byzantine Period, there was a village in the shadow of Kallimani Mountain just east of today‚Äôs village of Choreftaria. Groups of herders also grazed their flocks in the surrounding area. During this period, piracy was rampant; this village could not survive due to the fact that it was discernible to pirates from the sea. According to tradition, one night during a festive gathering, when the watchtowers were unattended, pirates landed from the sea of Aili where their ships were moored. A woman who had perhaps learned of their plan, took her eight daughters and fled toward Kourvinou to escape the pirate raid. The rest of the villagers were captured and taken to the slave market in Anatolia. After some time, the mother and her daughters returned to the area but settled in a densely forested ravine at the foot of the mountain for protection from the pirates. Their initial settlement was on the site of present-day Panochori. Rizovouni. This is the mountain where the village began. Pirates landed from the sea of Aili where their ships were moored. Around 1420 AD a village was founded and named Oktonees and later Oktonia (‚Äúokto‚Äù is the Greek for ‚Äúeight), for the eight young girls (‚Äúnees‚Äù) who escaped the pirates and first settled it. Development of this settlement over the years created present-day Oktonia. The inhabitants of Oktonia come from many areas of Greece: the islands, the Peloponnese, central Greece, Epirus, Karistos, Chalkida, northern Evia, Constantinople and Asia Minor. During the Turkish Occupation, the local population found comfort in religion from their suffering and humiliation, and there were four monasteries founded by the mid-16th century. Today, from these monastery complexes only the churches survive: St. George at Koutsouro, the Taxiarches (Archangels) at Kotsikia, the Presentation of the Virgin at Papavlassa, and St. Demetrios of the Waterfall. Of these churches, St. Demetrios of the Waterfall is most noteworthy because the monastery played a significant role in the years leading up to the revolutionary struggle of 1821. The church contains important examples of post-Byzantine painting. In 1921, by Royal Decree this church became a Prominent Monument of the State. During the 1821 Revolution, many people from the village fought and died to attain their freedom. The mountainous terrain favored the resistance and, because of its struggle against the Ottomans, Oktonia experienced battles, a siege on the castle (Kastro), torture and massacres. The Abbot of the Monastery of St. Demetrios, Paisios, was put to death by impalement. Oktoniates (people from Oktonia) also demonstrated their courage, patriotism and self-sacrifice during the subsequent National Liberation struggles including the Balkan Wars 1912-13, the Asia Minor Expedition and World War II. The history of Oktonia during this period was turbulent. The villagers suffered, were attacked, taken into captivity, and many were killed, but they demonstrated resistance, bravery, sacrifice, heroism and a will to survive. As a result of these experiences, the people of Oktonia became industrious, inventive, resilient, progressive, and persistent in achieving their aims.  Oktonia Today  Community building Cultural events Today Oktonia is a large, charming village of both new and renovated old houses with traditional tile roofs. Modern conveniences combine with age-old traditions in all aspects of village life. From the architectural standpoint, Oktonia is characterized as an Interesting Settlement with important structural and town-plan elements. These same pleasing elements are also found in the coastal settlements of Mourteri and Agios Mercurios. The village people are engaged in many occupations. They are farmers, stock- breeders, fishermen, beekeepers, masons, artisans, clerks, laborers, sailors and shopkeepers. There are two Parish Churches and a Community Center which houses a variety of cultural and educational activities. The village has a Primary School, 5 x 5 football field, basketball court, cafes, grocery stores, butcher shops, pastry & bakery shops, tavernas, bars and restaurants to meet the needs of residents and visitors alike. In addition to the Agricultural Cooperative, there are several other groups and associations in Oktonia: * The Association of Parents and Guardians of the Oktonia Primary School * The Youth Association of Oktonia * The Volunteer Fire Fighters of Oktonia * The Worldwide Association of Oktonia, Zoodochos Pigi, which publishes a newspaper, ‚ÄúThe Voice of Oktonia‚Äù and operates a Literary Book Club These organizations cooperate and assist each other in promoting the general welfare of the people. Individually and collectively, they host a number of cultural, educational, recreational and sporting events, without abandoning the village traditions.  Geography and Natural Environment  View of the village from the mount Kallimani = Geographical Location = Oktonia covers an area of 34,000 stremmata or 8,402 acres. Below the Kallimani Mountain which is still bare from the fires during Ottoman rule, the village lies amidst dense forest at an elevation of 400 meters. Oktonia overlooks the hill of Oksilithos, the plain, and neighboring villages and offers a splendid view of the Aegean Sea. = Climate = The climate of the village is mild, dry and healthy. Winter temperatures are not too cold and it is pleasantly cool in the summer due to the low humidity. The sea and land air are especially beneficial for people with respiratory conditions. = Agriculture, Stock-breeding and Fishing = View on the way to Mourteri settlement. Oktonia has a great deal of arable land and plenty of water, making it ideal for the cultivation of agricultural products. There are large olive groves and the primary products are olive oil and onions. The largest part of village itself is in the midst of walnut and plane trees, among others. Stock-breeding is widespread in Oktonia. Herds of goat and sheep graze the hills freely. Finally, there are many opportunities for professionals and amateurs alike to fish the abundant seas in close proximity to the village. Beaches such as Bournia are frequented by local people and visitors.  Interesting Sites and Leisure Activities  = Picturesque Communities and Their Natural Springs (Fountains) = Scattered among the four settlements of the village are a number of ornate fountains. Some are old and others are new, but each tells its own story. The best known of these fountains are: Marinou, Sgourou, Skoura, Karvouniari and Mitsara in Panohori (upper village), and Voivonta in Alonia, Ambades in Panagia and Soor in Katohori (lower village). St. Demetrios of the Waterfall = St. Demetrios of the Waterfall = In 1921, by Royal Decree the St. Dimitrios' church became a Prominent Monument of the State. The church remains today an important religious, historic and artistic monument. The monastery, which was located on the site, was a spiritual center inspiring freedom-fighters for the 1821 Revolution and also supplying the Greek Revolutionary ships that were in the sea of Markourio. This role in the Revolution resulted in the capture of the Abbot of the monastery, Paisios, who was put to death by impalement. The church interior is completely covered with extraordinary post-Byzantine paintings (1600) which depict a wide variety of religious themes in original, colorful compositions. It was deemed a Prominent Monument of the State by Royal Decree in 1921. As such, it took its place among the important Byzantine and post-Byzantine monuments of Greece such as the Monastery at Daphne and Osios Loukas. Kastri = Kastri and the Historic Castle (Kastro) = On the slopes of the mountain of Oktonia, Kallimani, is the area of Kastri which took its name from the medieval castle (Kastro) located on the mountain. From the Kastro all the other medieval castles in the area were visible (the Castle of Dragoneras, the Tower of Kipon, etc.) All of these castles were able to communicate among themselves by lighting torches on their towers. During the years leading up to the Revolution of 1821, the people of Oktonia took refuge in these fortresses against the attacks of the Turks who were under the leadership of the Pasha of Karistos, Ontabassin. Following a treasonous act, the castle was besieged and bombarded. The women and children fled to other areas, the aged and the weak were slaughtered and the fighters escaped to the mountains in order to organize their subsequent revolutionary actions. In retribution, the Turkish fighters burned the monastery of St. Demetrios and the entire area around Oktonia. Inside the castle walls is the Church of the Transfiguration of the Savior (Metamorphoseos tou Sotiros). On this site people sacrificed their lives for the cause of freedom. It has become a place of pilgrimage; visitors come for prayer, giving thanks, and glorifying God. Beside the church is a well which gathered rain water to meet the needs of the people when the castle was under siege. From the castle, visitors have a panoramic view of Oktonia and the villages of Kimi. The castle can be reached by car. In close proximity to the Kastro, on the side of the mountain facing Oktonia, is a cave four meters deep with an entrance three meters high. The approach to the castle may also be made by following a footpath which begins at Gorthia, a little below the Voivonta Fountain. St. George at Koutsouro = Byzantine and Post-Byzantine Churches (15th and 16th centuries) = St. George at Koutsouro, the Taxiaches (Archangels) at Kotsikia, the Presentation of the Virgin at Papavlassa and St. John the Theologian at Karvouni are noteworthy churches in the area. = New Churches = There are about seventeen new churches scattered in various locations in the area. Of special interest among these churches are the historic church of Zoodochos Pigi in Tsouka and St. John the Baptist which is between Alonia and Panagia. = Beaches = Along the ten kilometer sea coast of Oktonia are the beaches of Mourteri, Agios Mercurios, Bournias, Graves, Limionari, Aili and Kalami. = Cape Punta Sea Caves = Agios Merkurios beach Some of the caves along Cape Punta provided hiding places for people of Oktonia escaping the Turks. They waited for passing Greek ships to take them to other islands. View from the top of mount Kallimani Boti‚Äôs Cave (Tripa) = Mountain destinations = From the peak of Kallimani Mountain (elevation 750 meters) visitors have a panoramic view of the coast and the Aegean. Skyros and the Northern Sporades Islands can also be seen. The Boti‚Äôs Cave (Tripa) is in the area of Kakorrema (after Drimo) and has stalactites and stalagmites. It can be accessed by car, followed by a 15-minute hike. For the descent, a rope is required. Around the top of the mountain of Kallimani there are other caves including: # The cave Agiasma or Graspilaia situated at Askala a short distance from Boti‚Äôs Cave (Tripa). Finds here include ceramic objects and shards, and bones from Proto Helladic period (3200-2000 BC) # The Cave of Zoodochos Pigi, is a small cave in the church yard in Tsouka. The icon of the Virgin Mary was found in the cave, and the church of Zoodochos Pigi was built to honor it. # The cave situated at Pigadi is relatively close to Zoodochos Pigis. It is a horizontal cave with an entrance two meters high, width of 60 centimeters and length of four to five meters. # The Cave of Bonou or Bonista is located 200 meters from the cave at Pigadi. It has a length of five meters and depth of ten meters. Research inside the cave yielded a few prehistoric shards and many shards from the post-Roman historical period (4th-5th C. AD). # The Cave of Bourboula is found on the Northeast side of Kallimani Mountain at an elevation of 400 meters. The entrance has a width of five meters and maximum height of three meters. The cave was used seasonally as a shelter for herds of goats. # The Cave of the Transfiguration (Metamorphoseos) is found at Kastri (Kastro of Oktonia) near the church. It has a depth of four meters with an entrance three meters high. Research yielded shards perhaps from prehistoric times and from more recent periods. The cave was used in the past as a shelter for herds of goats.  Authorship  Written by * Panagiota Garoutsou - Liberopoulou * Sophia A.

Life Born in Amiens, he became a comic actor very early in life - his father was wigmaker to the magician Louis Compte, whose troupe he joined aged seven. He was part of several companies, including the Ambigu, the Vaudeville and the Vari√©t√©s. In 1847 he moved to the company of the Palais-Royal, where he remained until his death and appeared very regularly in plays by Eug√®ne Labiche. His reputation was partly founded on his large nose, remembered by Parisians long after his death. He lived in Montmartre with his wife and children, most notably during the siege of Paris, when he joined the 32nd Battalion of the Garde Nationale aged 60. He later retired to 3 rue d'Orl√©ans in Asni√®res, where he died in 1887. ¬´ Tablettes th√©√¢trales ¬ª,Le Matin, 10 mai 1887.  His main r√¥les  Hyacinthe and his famous nose.

The film follows the efforts of the strikers as they receive help from Coretta Scott King and both praise and admonishment from the public, even capturing the National Guard's arrival to the strikes. The documentary captures the workers' fight, considered \\"...one of the south‚Äôs most disruptive and bitter labor confrontations since the 1930s‚Äù, for recognition through the lens of an African-American women, and focuses on striker and mother Claire Brown. With the help of thousands of inspired protestors, the efforts are ultimately successful. Production Anderson was commissioned to create a documentary about the strike by the Hospital Workers Union Local 1199. She used archival footage and interviews with strikes and city officials. Of the commission, Anderson recalls: Anderson shared an interest in fighting for equity: \\"I knew that the obstacles that were before me were based on gender, race and politics...I tried to make a film that reflected my experience through their eyes.\\" The film captures the events through a feminist's lens. Reception Civil rights leaders praised the film; Fannie Lou Hamer said \\"..this film packs a tremendous punch and is deeply moving at the same time.\\" Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called it a \\"a familiar story of social injustice and self-determination that relates to the larger civil rights movement even as it remains rooted in specific lives\\". In popular culture Clips from the film appeared in a 2008 episode of The Colbert Report.

Career Pearl Cole McMullen, 1923 Pearl Cole McMullen was a dramatic soprano and a teacher of singing; she was available for concerts and recitals. She had a studio at the Majestic Theater Building, Los Angeles. The Matinee Musical Club, Los Angeles, was founded in 1908 by Lillian Ballagh Farmer. McMullen was the President. The club was the first in the field to pay musicians, particularly young persons just beginning their careers. McMullen was also the treasurer and federation-extension secretary of the Wa-Wan Club (formerly the Schubert Club), Los Angeles, president (and on the Board of Directors) of the Omaha Woman's Luncheon Club, and chairman of the membership committee of the Los Angeles Music Teachers' Association. In 1920 McMullen presented a recital before the members of the Ontario Current Events Club, Los Angeles.

Early life  Melville was born in Merchiston in Edinburgh, the elder daughter of Francis Suther Melville, a depute clerk of the Court of Session, and Helen Alexandrina Kerr. Melville was one of seven children; five brothers and two sister. She spent her childhood in Edinburgh, where she was educated at George Watson's Ladies' College and later studied music for a year in Germany.  Education  Following the 1889 Universities (Scotland) Act which allowed women to graduate from universities in Scotland, Melville became one of the first women to matriculate at the University of Edinburgh in 1892. She graduated five years later in 1897 with a first class MA Honours degree in Philosophy. In 1910 Melville was awarded a Bachelor of Divinity degree by the University of St Andrews, the first woman in Scotland to graduate with this degree.  Academic career  Following graduation, Melville worked as a tutor at the University of Edinburgh from 1896 to 1899, where she taught classes on logic, psychology, and metaphysics run by Professor Andrew Seth Pringle-Pattinson. From 1899 to 1909 Melville held the post of Warden of University Hall at the University of St Andrews. On her departure she wrote a \\"Memorandum on the duties of the warden of University Hall\\" which is held by the University of St Andrews Archives. After a short spell as lecturer in Mental and Moral Science at Cheltenham Ladies' College, Melville succeeded Janet Anne Galloway as Mistress of Queen Margaret College, University of Glasgow, in 1909 a post she held until the closure of the college in 1935. After becoming Head of the Women's Department at the University of Glasgow, Melville was asked to gather information on the suitability of women for diplomatic and consular service positions. This led to a lengthy correspondence between Melville and educationist Marjorie Rackstraw, warden of Masson House at the University of Edinburgh. Rackstraw was hoping to compile data from all Scottish universities in support of women's potential for governmental service and sought Melville's help to provide information on Glasgow's female graduates. At the height of her career Melville was the most senior female academic in Scotland, notable for her academic achievements and administrative abilities. In 1927 she was awarded an honorary LL.D by the University of Glasgow. She was the first woman academic to receive an honorary degree from the University. In King's Birthday Honours list of 1935 Melville was awarded an OBE.  Political activism  Throughout her life Melville campaigned for the cause of women's education. In 1902 she presented a paper \\"University Education for Women in Scotland: Its Effects on Social and Intellectual Life\\" at the Conference of the National Union of Women Workers of Great Britain and Ireland in Edinburgh and in 1911 contributed a paper titled \\"The Education of Woman\\" to a collection of essays The Position of Woman: Actual and Real. Melville argued that all women should have access to a general education and that the false dichotomy between the female ideals of domesticity and professionalism had a damaging influence on attitudes to women's education. During her time at St Andrews she set up the Association of University Women, from 1930 to 1931 she was president of the Soroptimists Club, and in 1935 she was appointed president of the British Federation of University Women. Melville was also an active and prominent suffragette and a member of the Edinburgh National Society for Women's Suffrage, the Scottish Universities Women's Suffrage Union, the Glasgow Women Citizens' Association and the Glasgow Society for Equal Citizenship. In 1906, Melville, together with Margaret Nairn, Chrystal Macmillan, Frances Simson, and Elsie Inglis took the universities of St Andrews and Edinburgh to the Court of Session, arguing that as members of the general council, they were entitled to vote. The University of Edinburgh conceded that > The women have been admitted to graduation in several of the faculties of > the universities and their names have been placed on the Register of the > General Council. They have attended and voted at the meetings of the General > Council, and they have hitherto enjoyed and exercised all the privileges > possessed by male graduates of the universities. However they refused to grant their request. After losing their case in 1907, Melville and her colleagues appealed through the House of Lords in 1908, but again the appeal was lost. In 1937, after the death of Ramsay MacDonald, Melville stood as an independent candidate in the Scottish Universities by- election, which was won by Sir John Anderson. Melville came second, ahead of Andrew Dewar Gibb and Sir Peter Chalmers Mitchell, with 5618 votes. During World War I Melville undertook a range of war work related to training women and during World War II she was a driver for the Home Guard.  Death  During her retirement, Melville lived in Dalry in Kirkcudbrightshire, before moving back to Edinburgh where she died on 7 March 1962 at her home on Merchiston Place. She is buried in Warriston Cemetery, Edinburgh.  Legacy  Melville House at the University of Glasgow is named in honour of Frances Melville and the University awards the Frances Melville medal annually to the most distinguished honours candidate in Mental Philosophy.

She attended school locally and then moved to Berlin to find a job. There she married Walter Mildenberg, a Jewish businessman. She also joined the recently established Communist Party. During 1929/30 she represented her party as a member of the Berlin city council. Then, in September 1930, she was one of 77 communists elected to the national parliament (Reichstag). She was one of the party's 54 directly elected candidates, representing Electoral District 4 (Potsdam). She remained a member of the Reichstag till July 1932. In 1931 Grete Mildenberg was sentenced for a serious Breach of the peace to an eight-month prison term by the district court in central Berlin. In January 1933 the Nazis took power and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Following the Reichstag fire at the end of February the authorities took a particular \\"interest\\" in members of the Communist Party. Party activity became, by definition, illegal, but Mildenberg continued to be politically active \\"underground\\". She was arrested in 1933. In 1938 Grete Mildenberg, her husband and their son who had been born in 1935, left Germany for Belgium. Later they emigrated either to the United States of America or to South America.

The name was created by Mendola during high school after brainstorming names and thought of \\"Kung Fu Grip\\", which later turned into a more randomized version of KungFu Rick. It was intentionally misspelled and remained that way for the majority of the band's releases. The band was a vital part of the local DuPage County Music Scene, one that the successful bands, Rise Against and The Plain White T's, emerged from.  Background  The musical style started out as more of a joke - to play fast and crazy music, with ridiculous lyrics. It was only later that the band evolved into the scene in which it would be more associated with, grindcore / powerviolence, and thrash punk. The band's first show was April 4, 1996. The band has been credited by John Caution (vocalist) with inspiring his successful power violence band, Weekend Nachos as noted in the documentary No Delusions. The band later spawned HeWhoCorrupts In 1998, the band was approached by fellow local area musicians, Jon Finaldi and Jason Zdora, of the band, Suburban Refugee. The two ended up joining the band, with Finaldi on drums and Zdora as the second guitarist. Kline later left the band within the next 6months, being replaced by David Rudnik of Seven Days of Samsara (later Get Rad), from Milwaukee WI. The band toured in 1998 with fellow Chicago band, My Lai (which at the time featured members of the band 7,000 Dying Rats, and later members of Cattle Decapitation, Phobia, as well as several others). Most of the tour consisted of west coast and parts of the south. During the California portion of the tour, the band played with The Locust and Cattle Decapitation, at one point playing a show in and staying at, the home of Justin Pearson of The Locust. In 1999-2000, the band toured the East Coast, and consistently played around the Midwest. On January 31, 2003, the band played the infamous 924 Gilman Street Club in Berkeley, CA. Over the years, the band has played with such notable acts as Melt Banana, Yakuza, and Life's Halt. It has released records on 625 Thrashcore and several other underground indie labels.

In 2010, the Government has been included in the Khoiyachora Waterfall National Park, after declaring 293.61 hectares of the block of Kunda Hat (Baratakia) block in the Baraiyadhala Block National Park. On behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh in 2017, the eco-tourism development project has been undertaken by the Department of Forest Department of Chittagong, \\"Ramgarh- Sitakunda-Reserve Forest\\", Khoiyachora Fountain, one of the main objectives is the conservation of the Khoiyachora Waterfall.

She was the manager of the Parramatta Female Factory in 1823-38, and one of the first schools for girls in Sydney between 1831 and 1842. Raine arrived in Australia from England as Elizabeth Fulloon with her children John, Charles, Eliza, Maria and Matilda in 1823. She and her spouse John Fulloon had been employed as joint superintendents of the Parramatta Female Factory, which had been founded in 1821 to house and employ female convicts not employed elsewhere. Her spouse died during the trip to Australia, but Elizabeth Fulloon became the first superintendent or \\"matron\\" of the Paramatta Female Factory, and was recommended for her efficiency. The governor called her \\"a woman of extraordinary bodily strength and energy of character\\", and she was reportedly able to manage the factory with such discipline that it was unnecessary with punishments. She married Robert Raines (d. 1828) in 1826, and thus became known as Elizabeth Raine. She later married a William Speed. In 1828, her daughter Matilda Fulloon (from 1832 Matilda Ormiston) had opened her own school for girls in Sydney, and in 1831, Elizabeth Raine became her partner and took over the post of manager of the school; they were also joined by her other daughter Eliza Fulloon (from 1836 Eliza Garnsey). The school belonged to the first schools for girls in the colony. The first known schools for girls in Australia was the school of a \\"Mrs Williams\\" in Sydney in 1806, of which not much more than the advertisement is known, but the school of Elizabeth Raine and her daughters were a stable and long lasting institution. It took a high fee and was successful, having 18 enlisted students in 1838, which was more than any of their competitors, such as the school of Mary Ann Fisk (1829-31) and the school of Anne de Metz and her daughters (1834-fl. 1868). The school offered basic education in The three Rs with geography, English grammar and needlework. At this time, schools for girls seldom offered much more than that, but it differed from the high class girl's schools in Europe, which normally offered education in music, French and art to be defined as a higher school for girls: such a school was not founded in Sydney until that of Elizabeth Allison (from 1842 Marr, from 1844 Wilkinsson) in 1839. Raine kept her position as manager of the school until her death in 1842.

It is located in Nicula village, Cluj County, in the vicinity of Gherla. An unconfirmed tradition holds that the monastery was established in the 14th century. The first documentary mention dates to 1552, when it was an Eastern Orthodox site. A 1659 reference notes that the monastery was vacant. It became Greek-Catholic at the end of the 18th century, just after the creation of that church, and was dedicated to Saint Nicholas. A radical restructuring took place in the same period, as attested by a wooden church from 1695, an iconostasis from 1694 and a bell from 1696.Adrian Andrei Rusu, Dic»õionarul mƒÉnƒÉstirilor din Transilvania, Banat, Cri»ôana »ôi Maramure»ô, p. 183. Cluj-Napoca: Editura Presa UniversitarƒÉ, 2000, An old place of Greek- Catholic pilgrimage, the church of the monastery housed over time the famous icon painted in 1681 by the artisan Luca of Iclod. According to a report by Austrian officers, the icon had been shedding tears between February 15 and March 12, 1699. In 1713 Transylvanian Governor Sigismund Kornis took the icon to the noble residence at Kornis Castle in Benediugu Dejului, from where it reached Cluj.Robert Born: Nicula, in: Joachim Bahlcke, Stefan Rohdewald, Thomas W√ºnsch, Religi√∂se Erinnerungsorte in Ostmitteleuropa, Akademie Verlag 2013, pp. 209-222 History Pope Clement XIII granted in 1767 plenary indulgence to the Greek-Catholic pilgrims who were traveling to the Monastery of village Nicula during the Marian feasts of August 15 (Assumption of the Mother of God) and September 8 (Nativity of the Mother of God). In 1774, a single monk lived there. The stone church of the monastery was built next to the previously built wooden church, between 1875 and 1879, at the expense of the Gherla Diocese. Two spires of 25 meters were added in 1905. In 1928 Pope Pius XI granted this Greek-Catholic monastic sanctuary the status of Marian Sanctuary. The iconostasis was replaced in 1938, the furnishings date to 1913, the walls were repaired in 1925 and a summer altar was built in 1925. There is an 1899 guesthouse, a space for pilgrims (1913-1920, 1927) and a monks' residence (1926). The wooden church burned in 1973, and another one was brought in, dating to the 18th century. Through the school of artisans of icons from Nicula Monastery, Transylvania entered the glass painting technique, originated in Bohemia, Austria and Bavaria, areas where the tradition of glass manufactures was intertwined with the popular Catholic religiosity. In 1948, when the Greek-Catholic Church was outlawed by the nascent communist regime, the monastery was confiscated by the authorities and transferred to the Romanian Orthodox Church, which continues to own and use it.

The law is often enacted to expedite trials where a successful prosecution is in doubt, or in cases that are likely going to be lengthy and protracted, or are at risk of being delayed. The settlement does not equal a conviction, and does not appear on the criminal record of those under investigation. Under article 2046 of the Civil Code, the right to propose a settlement rests exclusively with the Public Prosecutor at any time during the proceedings.  History  = Early versions 1930s - 1980s = The origins of Belgium's penal settlement law date to 1935, when Belgian Parliament moved to create a new prosecutorial mechanism in order to expedite the processing of court cases and reduce backlog. The application of the mechanism was gradually broadened over the years, being originally reserved for small offences only. On 28 June 1984, the law underwent its most recent significant amendment when article 216bis was added. The article introduced the Criminal Transaction and made the law applicable to any criminal offence carrying a maximum prison sentence of five years. = Major amendments 2011 - 2017 = Amending the law was first discussed in 2008, based on an initiative by the Antwerp World Diamond Centre, a private organization representing the business interests of the diamond industry. The proposal was rejected by lawmakers at the time. The debate resurfaced in 2011, when Minister for Institutional Reforms and deputy chairman of the parliamentary diamond forum, Servais Verherstraeten, proposed \\"to amend the Criminal Code with regard to the discontinuance of criminal proceedings by paying a sum of money.\\" Subsequently, the transaction law was significantly reformed on 14 April 2011, with amendments to article 216bis in particular carrying procedural and material implications. Previously, a proposal for a penal transaction could not be brought forward by the prosecutor if criminal proceedings had already been initiated. Therefore, a penal transaction was only possible while proceedings were still in the preliminary investigation stage. Since the amendment, however, a criminal transaction can now be proposed by the public prosecutor even when the case has already been referred to a judge to order an in-depth investigation or when the court has already made itself apprised of the case at hand. In July 2011, article 216bis was amended to once again further extend the law's application to more financial crimes and misdemeanors, such as tax matters. The amendment was regarded as a way to fight back the judicial backlog, particularly in cases pertaining to financial matters, and as a means to return large sums of money to the state that would otherwise have been lost. In 2017, a Commission of Inquiry was assembled to investigate how the law had come about. It was determined that the law passed due to a political give-and-take between the PS and Liberal Party at the time, with the PS seeking to push through a lift on banking secrecy, while the liberals sought for a new criminal settlement arrangement. A political agreement was reached on 3 February 2011 following the mediation of the Yves Leterne (CD&V;) cabinet. On 4 July 2017, the head of the inquiry commission, Dirk van der Maelen (SP.A), stated his belief in an interview with Belgian newspaper Knack that the diamond sector and College of Prosecutors- General are the ‚Äúfathers‚Äù of the settlement law, under the political responsibility of the CD&V.; He justified this point of view by arguing that the law was drafted by two lawyers on behalf of the Antwerp World Diamond Center in 2007, in order to help the industry deal with fiscal fraud accusations. It has been suggested that a similar transaction law adopted in France in January 2017 could serve as an inspiration for Belgian lawmakers, because it features an Anglo-Saxon style ‚Äúpublic interest compensation agreement‚Äù which places greater emphasis on being ‚Äúreformative‚Äù for the purpose of criminal prevention via a mandatory compliance program.  Criticism  Critics argue that the amendment marked the first step towards ‚Äúclass justice‚Äù and a two-speed court system favoring those who are able to afford such payments. Belgium's constitutional court ruled in June 2016 that parts of the law were unconstitutional as the termination of the prosecution following a settlement payment occurs without effective control by a judge. The court argued this constitutes a violation of the principles of equality and non-discrimination enshrined in the Constitution. The law was annulled as a consequence. However, because some lower courts continued to pronounce verdicts which the constitutional court still accepted as being within the limits it had laid down in its ruling, the College of Prosecutors-General decided to reinstate the law in June 2017.

With his brother, he made the first set of panoramic pictures of Niagara Falls and a sequential set of pictures of the first American total solar eclipse ever photographed.  Early life  Langenheim was born with given names Frederick David in Brunswick, Germany, on May 5, 1809. He emigrated to America in 1840 to Philadelphia where his older brother William was already living. William had immigrated to America in 1834 and lived in Texas for a while before moving to Florida and eventually to Philadelphia in 1839. Their father Friedrich Wilhelm was mayor of Schoningen, Germany, from 1808 to 1813.  Mid life and career  In 1840, Langenheim and his brother William began working for a German language newspaper edited by George Francis Schreiber in Philadelphia. Langenheim acquired a daguerreotype camera from Von Voigtlander and formed a partnership with Schreiber in a photographic studio business for a couple of years in 1841. In 1843 Langenheim went into the photography studio business with his brother at 26‚Äì27 Exchange Street in Philadelphia. It was the W. & F. Langenheim firm and known as the Philadelphia daguerrotype establishment. They made in 1842 the first advertising picture in history. It was of patrons eating and drinking in the restaurant in the Philadelphia Exchange Building. The picture of people dining was hung in the hall of the building to attract potential customers for the dining room. In 1845, Langenheim took the first set of panoramic pictures of Niagara Falls ever photographed. The panoramic set of five adjacent scenes were placed in panels in a display frame. The daguerreotype pictures were the first of Niagara Falls according to photo historian Robert Taft (1894-1955). They were the first such pictures to gain world fame. There were eight sets of copies made. A set was sent to the photographer Louis Jacques Mand√© Daguerre and five crowned heads of Europe, Queen Victoria, and one each to the reigning rulers of Brunswick, Prussia, Saxony, and Wurttemberg. The seventh set was given to United States president James Knox Polk and the eighth set was retained by the Langenheim brothers. American Stereoscopic Company stereocard Langenheim invented a technique in 1846 for coloring daguerreotype plates and was issued a patent for it. With his brother in 1849 Langenheim used a photography technique invented by Abel Ni√©pce de Saint-Victor which produced negative lantern glass slides. They renamed it \\"hyalotype\\" photography and patented it in 1850. The hyalotype glass slides were produced by an albumen process and were used for views of historic buildings in New York City, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. These slides were also used in portraits of famous Americans. In 1850, Langenheim with his brother introduced stereoscopy and were the first Americans to sell stereocards to the public.Frederick Langenheim bio Langenheim and his brother were the first to produce stereographs commercially in America. They operated the American Stereoscopic Company from about 1850 to 1860 in Philadelphia. 1854 ‚Äì first set of American \\"Eclipse of the Sun\\" pictures ever taken Brother William Langenheim, c. 1850 Frederick David Langenheim as child On May 26, 1854, Langenheim and his brother took interval timed pictures of the first American total solar eclipse ever photographed. There were eight phases taken of different time sequences and are the earliest known eclipse pictures taken in the United States. The seven surviving pictures are owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The pictures range in size from high by wide to high by wide. Six daguerreotypists and another photographer took images of the event, but only the Langenheim ones survive.  Later life and death  Langenheim and his brother William were active in selling photographs until William died in 1874; at that point, Langenheim retired.

He represented Hazebrouck in the Nord department as a deputy in the last years of the July Monarchy. He avoided politics during the French Second Republic and the early years of the Second French Empire, then again represented Hazebrouck as a champion of Catholic and protectionist interests from 1857 until his death in 1888. He made a fortunate marriage through which he became President of the Compagnie des mines de B√©thune. He was briefly Minister of Public Works in 1870. Early years (1814‚Äì41) Ignace Plichon was born on 28 June 1814 in Bailleul, Nord. His parents were Ildephonse Plichon (1773‚Äì1855), a merchant and then manufacturer of salts and soaps, and Jos√©phine B√©n√©dictine Leclercq (1772‚Äì1835). His grandfather was the censier (rent collector) of Marchiennes Abbey and mayor of Abscon. He was educated by the Jesuits at the Abbey of Saint-Acheul, then studied law in Paris. In the early 1830s Plichon became a follower of the social idealism of Saint- Simonianism. When that movement's leader, Barth√©lemy Prosper Enfantin, added religion to the Saint-Simonian economic doctrine, Plichon accepted the new pantheism. Enfantin called Plichon his \\"dear penguin\\", an illusion to the fact that Plichon had lost an arm in a hunting accident. Enfantin, Barrault and other followers left for Egypt around 1832, while Plichon continued his studies in Paris. He returned to Bailleul to practice law, but in 1835 remained in correspondence with the Saint-Simonians in Paris. He received a doctorate in law in 1836. Tunisia (1841‚Äì42) In 1841 Ahmed Bey of Tunis was concerned that the Sultan of Constantinople, theoretically his sovereign, was planning to send a fleet to obtain the tribute that was owed to him. He asked for the support of France. France did not want the Turks to threaten Algeria, which they had decided to fully occupy, so sent a naval division to La Goulette, the port of Tunis. They were joined there by a British force. Fran√ßois Guizot, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, sent Plichon on a diplomatic mission to Tunis. He was instructed to also check the risk of a Turkish expedition to Tunis by land from Tripoli. Plichon, a young man with no diplomatic experience, was to cross the great tract of desert between the two cities. Plichon reached La Goulette on 12 September 1841. He sailed to Tripoli where he learned about the local political situation from Captain Bailleul, head of the French military mission, then set out on the hazardous land journey from Tripoli to Tunis along the coast, passing through no man's land between the last Turkish outpost of Zuwarah and the Gulf of Gab√®s. In 1842 he presented his memoir on the regency of Tunis to Guizot. He confirmed that there was no risk of an upset to the status quo in Tunis. Although the religious reformer Muhammad al-Sanusi was present in the region, Plichon did not mention him in his report. His lengthy report discussed the history of the regency, once prosperous from piracy, now constrained by the French and British, and suffering from revolts in the south. The regency had the same area as France but only 600,000 inhabitants. Plichon provided many statistics on the Tunisian finances, army and tribal forces, and advocated the same expansive colonial policy as in Algeria. Egypt (1844‚Äì45) In 1844, when Enfantin founded the journal L'Alg√©rie, Plichon provided some of the financing. Enfantin, with support from Fran√ßois Barth√©lemy Arl√®s-Dufour, a Saint-Simonian financier of Lyon, was dreaming of creating a great railway network in France. He planned to also establish maritime commercial links with the Indies through a Suez canal. Enfantin decided to send Plichon to Egypt to obtain information. There he was welcomed by Saint-Simonians such as the engineer Charles Lambert, the doctor Nicolas Perron, and Linant de Bellefonds, author of a detailed study of projects to pierce the Isthmus of Suez. After obtaining the information he needed, Plichon took his time returning. He visited Upper Egypt as far as the first cataract and travelled by camel to see the Isthmus of Suez and the Sinai. He was robbed by Bedouins, whom he thought had far less valour than the Tunisians and Tripolitanians. He visited Palestine and Syria, and by 1845 was in Constantinople. He then returned to Bailleul and local politics. Plichon was awarded the Legion of Honour after his return. July Monarchy deputy (1846‚Äì48) In 1845 Bailleul was represented in the Chamber of Deputies by the legitimist mayor Louis Henri Behaghel. The 800 electors of the Hazebrouck constituency were more interested in Rothschild's planned railway network than in the dynastic question, and wanted their city to be the intersection between the Paris‚ÄìCalais and Lille‚ÄìDunkirk main lines. Plichon was known to have ministerial contacts. The municipal council entrusted him, along with B√©hagel's rival Lagrange, to take control of their affairs. Helped by Guizot, who wanted to reduce the influence of the loyalists in the Nord, Plichon achieved good results and became popular. He defeated B√©hagel by 400 to 358 votes in the August 1846 legislative elections. Plichon held office from 1 August 1846 to 24 February 1848. He took an independent position within the ministerial group. After the French Revolution of 1848 he did not seek reelection as a deputy under the French Second Republic. In July 1849 he was elected general councilor of the Nord. Plichon as a deputy of the Corps l√©gislatif Second French Empire (1851‚Äì70) During the Second French Empire Ignace Plichon became a leader of the protectionists and Catholics. Some thought that Plichon was the spokesperson for the \\"grande famille\\" of landowners in the Nord region, the intermarried Cleenwerck, Vandewalle, Bieswal and de Coussemacker families. He was elected a member of the Corps l√©gislatif for the 4th constituency of Nord on 22 June 1857. Plichon was very independent in the legislature. In February 1858 he voted against the law of general safety. In March 1860 he demanded an inquiry into the election of Albert de Dalmas. He was one of the four deputies who voted against the tariff on wool, cotton and other raw materials in 1860. In 1860 he protested the invasions of Piedmont in such strong terms that the president of the Chamber, Charles de Morny, withdrew his speech. He criticized the inconsistency of Napoleon III's policies, saying \\"One cannot be revolutionary in Italy and remain conservative in France and Rome.\\" In 1861 Ignace Plichon married Adeline Marie Constance Marguerite Boittelle (1840‚Äì94). Plichon was 47 at the time, while Adeline was 21. His father in law was Alexis Boitelle, an administrator of the Compagnie des mines de B√©thune, and Plichon became an administrator himself. Adeline's uncle was Symphorien Boittelle, a very energetic prefect of the Paris police from 1858 to 1866, deputy for the Nord until 1863, and Senator from 1866. Another uncle was Edward Boitelle, future member of the Legislature. The marriage opened the door to many influential Parisians close to the Boittelle and Haussmann families. In 1862 Plichon spoke of the revival of socialism, saying a \\"certain press was responsible\\" while the Catholic journals had to remain silent. In February 1863 he attacked the system of official candidacies, and on this occasion demanded freedom of the press and electoral freedom. Despite losing official support, he was reelected on 1 June 1863 to the first constituency of the Nord against the official candidate, Alfred de Clebsattel. In a conservative region it might seem surprising that the official candidate would be decisively defeated by an Orl√©anist. However, Plichon was well-respected and locally generous, a protectionist and backed by the clergy. He won support from Legitimists from Bergues, Hondschoote and Wormhout, supporters of the Empire and republicans. \\"M. Plichon, ministre des Travaux publics\\" (1870) Plichon remained independent, although he often voted with the majority. He was made an Officer of the Legion of Honour on 14 August 1867. He was reelected on 24 May 1869. He did not face official opposition. He represented the Groupe Centre gauche. He signed the Interpellation of the 116 [deputies] in July 1869 demanding greater involvement in government decisions. He was a member of the commission of inquiry into the Merchant Navy. In February 1870 Plichon supported the Liberal Empire. On 15 May 1870 he replaced Auguste de Talhou√´t- Roy, who had resigned, as Minister of Public Works. He voted in favor of the Franco-Prussian War. He left office with the rest of the Ollivier cabinet on 10 August 1870. The Chamber was dissolved on 4 September 1870. French Third Republic (1871‚Äì88) Under the French Third Republic Ignace Plichon was a member of the National Legislature and then the Chamber of Deputies for Nord from 8 February 1871 to 3 June 1888, representing the Union des Droites. He adhered to Marc Girardin's Orl√©anist opposition group. Plichon was elected General Councillor of Nord for the canton of Bailleul on 8 October 1871. He served as vice-president of the departmental council from 1871 to 1874 and president from 1874 to 1879. He was president of the Mines de B√©thune administrative council from 1873 to 1883, when he resigned, apparently due to a conflict with his father in law Bouitelle. The company faced many difficulties during his term of office, and had only moderate growth, since neither Plichon nor Boitelle had technical training. Plichon was elected deputy on 20 February 1876 for the Hazebrouck constituency. He continued to sit on the right, and supported the ministry of Albert de Broglie against the 363. He opposed the constitutional amendment proposed by Henri-Alexandre Wallon and the subsequent constitutional laws. He was reelected on 14 October 1877. He opposed the educational, colonial and economic policies of the Republican ministries. He ran for election as Senator for Nord on 5 January 1879, but did not succeed. Plichon was reelected as Deputy for Hazebrouck on 21 August 1881. He continued to sit on the right. He was reelected Deputy for Nord on 4 October 1885 as candidate of the Conservative Union. Ignace Plichon died on 3 June 1888 in Paris. Ignace's son, Jean Plichon, was a monarchist deputy and then senator for Nord. His son Pierre was administrator for the Compagnie des Mines de B√©thune. His grandson Jean-Pierre Plichon, son of Pierre, was deputy for Nord from 1936 to 1942.

Similar to Russia's web brigades and China's 50 Cent Army, participants report that they are organized into teams and groups of commentators that participate in Vietnamese and international political blogs and Internet forums using sockpuppets and large-scale orchestrated trolling and disinformation campaigns to promote pro-Vietnamese communist propaganda. Background It is unclear how the brigades started since the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPVN) often controls political information. However, the earliest form of Internet propaganda supporting CPVN seems to have begun in 2007, when the Government announced to \\"eliminate any wrong news that threaten the Party's rule\\". As the Communist Party is the only party allowed by Vietnamese constitution, it was the beginning of the brigades. In 2017, Lieutenant-General Nguyen Trong Nghia, deputy head of the Vietnamese military's political department, confirmed that Vietnam has a new, 10,000-strong military cyber warfare unit to counter criticisms of the government on the Internet.The cyber unit named Force 47 is active in several sectors.

Methods The methods used are not always clear, but includes criticism of opposing views to those of the Communist Party. Vietnamese nationalists, dissidents and anti-communists claim that the CPVN has been doing this for a long time, to brainwash people's minds and distort and truth, branding who disagree with the Communist Party as \\"traitors of the nation\\". BBC and Deutsche Welle correspondents have also reported about the brigades' activities. Other Governments also accused Vietnamese Communist Party's troll army for attacking and hacking websites that criticize the CPVN. = Claims of distortion of history = There are claims that the CPVN has attempted to rewrite history, including war crimes by North Vietnam during Vietnam War having been completely erased to serve the Party's agenda, promoting only themselves as the \\"heros\\" of Vietnam.

The Superior of the Church is bishop-elect Waldemar Maj. In 2016, there were 535 believers in Poland.  History  = Polish Old Catholic Church = The Old Catholic Church in Poland is a continuation of the mission of the Polish Old Catholic Church, which was established in 1933 as a result of the split in the Polish diocese of the Polish Catholic Church. The first bishop of the Polish Old Catholic Church was Wladyslaw Faron, who left the PNCC structure in 1931. In the interwar Poland, the Old Catholic Church operated as an informal union with the parish priest of Father J√≥zef Kostorz from the Old Catholic Church in Germany. After World War II in Poland, the Old Catholic Church entered the ecclesial union with the Polish Old Catholic Churches: the Old Catholic Church of Mariavite and the mission diocese of the Polish National Catholic Church. However, in 1948 it broke up after Bishop Faron and a few priests joined the Roman Catholic Church. Bishop Zygmunt Szypold became the superior of the Polish Old Catholic Church. After his death, the authorities of the Polish People's Republic suspended the activities of the Church (1965), citing a lack of authority. The faithful of the Polish Old Catholic Church either went to other churches or practiced underground faith until the resumption of the official activity of the Church, made through the entry into the Register of Churches and Religious Unions in the Ministry of Interior and Administration by Fr.

It was not until 2006 that the church court removed him from office and excommunicated him. Since 2000, the acting supervisor was Bishop Marek Kordzik, but in the register of churches and other religious figures as the head of the church from July 25, 2006, because it was necessary to his election to the National Synod in accordance with the requirements of the then-current church law.

During its deliberations, a decision was taken to positively consider the application for incardination of the English community of the Old Catholic Church, which in 2006 chaired by Bishop Christopher Rogerson decided to disconnect from the mother church as a result of a scandal that shook the community in those years. A resolution was also adopted expressing the consent to grant episcopal ordination to the elect of the English community - Fr. John Tasker. During these deliberations, the Head of the Old Catholic Church in the Republic of Poland, Bishop Dariusz Majewski, due to his liberal ecclesial policy, which was a clear departure from the principles of the undivided Church, gave the Synod Fathers the resignation from the office of the Superior. In a secret ballot, fr. Waldemar Maj became the new Head of the Old Catholic Church in the Republic of Poland  Administration of the Church  The Church is divided into two dioceses in Poland: Southern and Northern, administered by the Superior of the Old Catholic Church. In 2017, the Church had 254 faithful (including 15 priests). The church did not establish a central parish (cathedral). The headquarters of the church is in Gda≈Ñsk.

She received this award within the first seven years after completing her PhD in economics from the University of California, Berkeley. In 2017, she was named one of the \\"Best 40 under 40 Business School Professors\\" by Poets and Quants. Halac was born and raised in Buenos Aires and studied economics at the University of CEMA, Argentina from 1998 to 2001. Here, her professors encouraged her to pursue an advanced economics degree in the United States. Following her graduation in 2001, she and her husband, Guillermo Noguera, became research assistants at the World Bank in Washington, D.C., and then both earned doctoral degrees in economics at the University of California at Berkeley. Her research focuses on theoretical models of how to optimally delegate decision making, such as optimal rules for firms that need to delegate investment decisions to managers with competing incentives, problems of how to motivate experimentation and innovation, the design of fiscal rules to constrain government spending, and the role of reputation in maintaining productivity. Her work on relational contracting, which studies how best to design contracts in a principal-agent setting where the value of the relationship is not mutually known, suggests new ways to approach dynamic contracting problems with bargaining.

Early life Kathleen Elizabeth Royds was born on 15 January 1883 in Reading, Berkshire, England to Sarah Anne (n√©e Spicer) and William Alexander Slater Royds. Her family were Quakers and her father was a physician. His father, Reverend Thomas Royds, was a legatee of her great- grandfather, Thomas Royds of Greenhill, who made his fortune from the Lancashire cotton mills. In 1895, the family moved to St Mary Bourne, a village in Hampshire with Roman and Saxon roots, which sparked her growing interest in history. Her mother, Sarah, was very involved with the work of the church and all six of the siblings regularly attended services. As the daughter of a wealthy physician, she spent her childhood, roaming the area, reading books from her father's library, and was not expected to pursue a career. Royds passed her Cambridge exams with honours and entered university, the first woman of her family to seek a university education. In 1907, Royds began teaching at St. Katharine's College Practising School to complete her one-year practicum requirement and graduated with her teachers diploma from Cambridge University after completing the year. Career Royds began teaching at the Wycombe House School in Brondesbury in 1910. Wishing to further her own education and being barred from attaining a degree because of Cambridge's restriction on women, she enrolled at Cresham College to prepare for the entrance examinations of the University of London. After completion of four semesters, which were supervised by William Henry Hudson, she obtained a chancellor's diploma in literature from London University and as valedictorian in her class received both the Gilchrist Medal and the Churton Collins Memorial Prize. In 1911, she published a biography and critical analysis of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Coleridge and His Poetry. The following year, she published a similar treatment for Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Elizabeth Barrett Browning & Her Poetry. Both of these works were encouraged by William Henry Hudson, who continued to serve as a mentor for Royds, securing a position for her as an assistant marker for London University Extension lectures. While still working and publishing, Royds continued her studies and in 1912, after a thirty-six-hour examination in English and German literature and language, she earned her BA degree with class II honours in modern languages. After completing her schooling, Royds began teaching in a private girls schools such as women's high schools in Andover, Hampstead, Hendon, and Highfield, as well as the Jersey Ladies College. In 1914, while on holiday in Germany, World War I broke out and she made a difficult escape from behind enemy lines by way of Denmark to return to England and her post at Wycombe School. She kept a diary that related the details of her and her colleagues' journey. In 1915, Royds left her teaching post to assist with the evacuation of Serbian refugees. Joining with volunteers from the Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service (SWH) en route to Salonika, she was hired as an orderly; however, she was quickly moved into a clerical position because of her skill with French and German. She also studied Serbian, becoming indispensable to her unit because of her multi-lingual ability, working as a go-between with the SWH and Serbian Relief Fund (SRF) workers. At the end of 1916, Royds decided not to reenlist with the SWH. Instead, she contracted directly with the SRF and was sent to a small refugee camp at Ucciani, where she remained until the end of 1917. She wrote of her experiences in relocating Serbs to Corsica in an article, With the Serbians in Corsica which was originally published in The Contemporary and reprinted in Maclean's Magazine in Canada. Another relief project in which she participated in was the collection of rubber teats for infant feeding to be sent to Germany. For her relief work, she was awarded the Order of St. Sava from Serbia. Upon her return to England, Royds took employment in Birmingham, but remained only until May 1918 when she was offered full-time employment in London. Because of her father's illness and subsequent death, she was unable to go with the British Relief to Serbia. The war pushed her toward pacifism, and Royds joined the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) and the League of Nations Union (LNU). She also joined the Union of Democratic Control as a part-time paid organiser and within a few months was hired in 1919 as the full-time secretary of the WILPF's London office. In 1921 Royds married George Alexander Innes, a fellow relief worker whom she had met in Salonika. Soon after her mother's death in 1922, the couple relocated to Lewes in Sussex, where George worked as a partner in an engineering firm. Innes resigned as the London secretary of WIPF, but the organisation made her a board member to keep from losing her skill, necessitating monthly trips to London. In 1924, when his partnership ended, the couple returned to London. In the 1920s, Innes was active in promoting peace, serving as the referent for the League of Nations, on the Board of the London chapter of WILPF, and as the secretary of the Society of Friends' Peace Committee. She continued to publish works, though on internationalist ideals of the League of Nations, including: The Story of the League of Nations (1925), How the League of Nations Works (1926), The League of Nations and the World's Workers (1927), The Reign of Law (1929) and The Story of Nansen and the League (1932). By the early 1930s, she was serving as an honorary secretary of the London WILPF and was a proponent of using sanctions as a means to prohibit war. In 1927, Innes was elected to serve as vice chair of the London WILPF and remained in that capacity until 1934, when she became chair. Simultaneously, from 1926 to 1936, she served as secretary of the Society of Friends' Peace Committee. In 1937, she succeeded Cornelia Ramondt-Hirschmann as one of the three joint co-chairs of the international WILPF and served through the duration of World War II along with Gertrude Baer and Clara Ragaz. During this same time frame, she published book reviews and articles in a variety of Quaker journals including The Friend, The Wayfarer and The World Outlook. The reviews were primarily of literature which dealt with internationalist themes and social movements, including histories of peace and suffrage movements; biographical articles of Gandhi, Florence Nightingale, Alfred Nobel and others; and travel narratives, like Through the Caucasus to the Volga by Fridtjof Nansen. At the same time, she travelled throughout England giving lectures and radio presentations not only for peace, but also as part of a BBC program Broadcast to Schools and lectured on scriptural interpretation of the role of women in society, believing women as capable as men in negotiations. She did not believe that morally reprehensible actions could justify patriotism and felt that all human life was important, following an anti-imperialist stance. Given the time frame, Innes' anti- segregationist ideas were radical, but she supported the ability of Africans to \\"rationally\\" govern themselves. She published Peacemaking in Africa (1932), which argued for a disinterested third party to assist in settling disputes and pointed out that so-called \\"civilized nations\\" had armed the Africans, which in turn led to wars. During The Blitz, Innes moved back to Hampshire and operated the London WILPF out of her home. Until the end of the war, she wrote articles about international politics. When the conflict ceased, she continued publishing, writing local histories about the Hampshire area and some biblical stories. Death and legacy Innes died on 27 March 1967 from colon cancer in Andover, Hampshire, England. Some of her literary criticisms and her Hampshire history continued to be reprinted into the 1980s.

She had two siblings: John Quincy Brooks and Lucy Zipporah Brooks. No colleges were open for women during her girlhood, but Gleason gave herself a fair collegiate education from college text-books studied at home. Her husband, Dr. Silas O. Gleason, when he became professor of hygiene in the Central Medical College in Rochester, New York, succeeded in persuading the faculty and trustees to open the college doors to women. Rachel Brooks Gleason studied with her husband and was graduated in medicine in 1851. She was the fourth woman to earn a medical degree in the United States. Career Elmira Water Cure After graduation, Gleason practiced three years in a sanitarium in Glen Haven, New York, and one year in Ithaca, New York. She was at the head of the Elmira Water Cure, opened in 1852, later known as Gleason Sanitarium, in Elmira, New York, for more than forty years. The hydropathic health resort catered to women of the upper class, their specialty was \\"lady troubles\\". The Gleason sold the business in 1899, and all the buildings were demolished in 1959. She had a large consulting practice, extending to most of the towns in the State. Her book on home treatment for invalids, Talks to my Patients: hints on getting well and keeping well (New York, 1870) run into eighth edition. After her graduation in medicine, she gave lectures on physiology and hygiene to women, assisted by the best models and charts to be had at the time. She held bible and prayer classes every Saturday for twenty-five years. She was an advocate of dress reform and women's freedom from early girlhood. She assisted eighteen women students through medical colleges, all of whom were dependent upon her for financial support, and most of them rescued from invalidism. Many of these students became prominent, and all were competent physicians. Gleason was a strong anti-slavery worker before the Civil War, and rendered constant assistance to Freedmen's schools ever since. Personal life Rachel Brooks Gleason and Silas O.

The rally caused controversy as it was scheduled one week after the stabbings by Jeremy Christian. The mayor of Portland, Ted Wheeler had requested that federal authorities revoke the permit saying he was concerned over increasing tensions in the city due to the stabbings. The General Services Administration denied the request, stating that the permit had been lawfully obtained weeks beforehand. The Oregon chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union's legal director, Mat Dos Santos, said it was unconstitutional of Wheeler to attempt to prevent the demonstration based on the political and personal viewpoints of those who organized the event. Gibson cancelled the event citing safety concerns. By the end of the month, Patriot Prayer gathered for their \\"Freedom March\\" on June 30, 2017, at the Portland Waterfront near the annual Blues Festival, and were met by counter-protesters. The often heated exchanges of the dueling rallies ended with minimal violence and no reports of arrests. The rally occurred in the midst of a national debate on the First Amendment, one which has seen violent clashes between right-wing and left-wing groups over appearances by contentious public figures, often in liberal cities such as Portland. The atmosphere in Portland had also become tense after Christian's recent arrest for the train attack. On August 6, 2017, it was much smaller crowds for their \\"Freedom March\\" at Salmon Street Springs, Portland, but it followed the well-established pattern with a few arrests of counter protesters and a lot of shouting and chants from both the Patriot Prayer group and counter protesters. Patriot Prayer planned an event for San Francisco in late August 2017. CBS reported the city called in its entire police force for the date in anticipation of unrest similar to previous Patriot Prayer rallies in Seattle and Portland. Mayor Ed Lee condemned the event, saying: \\"The shameful, anti-American trend of hate-filled extremist rallies will unfortunately be allowed to continue this weekend in our city.\\" Lee added that \\"San Francisco does not welcome outside agitators whose messages of hate have the sole purpose of inciting violence.\\" The original rally was set to take place at Crissy Field, which is not under the jurisdiction of the San Francisco city government, instead administered by the National Park Service, who granted Patriot Prayer the permit to march. Patriot Prayer ended up cancelling their event when they saw that they had attracted thousands of counter-protesters, opting instead to hold a press conference at Alamo Square. In response to the last minute move to a location deep within San Francisco, the city ended up fencing off the entire park, closing it to the public to prevent violence, which led to Gibson cancelling that event as well. Gibson then said that Patriot Prayer members would instead be attending an anti-Marxist rally in nearby Berkeley, but also called that event off as well. The counter-protest was entirely peaceful, with protesters opting to hold a large dance party instead of a violent confrontation, and there was only one arrest for public intoxication. For the September 10, 2017, \\"Peaceful Portland Freedom March\\" in Portland, Gibson asked followers take a new non-violent approach, although not all appeared willing to go along and the counter-protests also appeared to be settling on a number of different measures depending on the organization. Patriot Prayer announced additional changes, including the collection of charitable relief for the victims of the Eagle Creek fire in the Columbia River Gorge and a name change for a rally to \\"Peaceful Vancouver Freedom March\\". The small rallies drew large counter-protest crowds in both Portland and Vancouver with several arrests and the detention of the driver of a pickup that sped through a crowd of counter-protesters, no injuries were reported. Among those drawn to the rallies were the militia-style Three Percenters and the Proud Boys, a white nationalist group. On June 3, 2018, Patriot Prayer and anti-fascists again fought in parks in downtown Portland. Police arrested four people for disorderly conduct. Participants threw rocks, bottles, ball bearings, and fireworks at each other. The Portland Mercury reported that Patriot Prayer organized the rally as a counter-protest to another leftist rally led by the Empower Portland Alliance and the Direct Action Alliance. This earlier rally was intended to protest police violence and to commemorate the anniversary of an incident a year earlier when Portland police detained 200 people for several hours. In response to Patriot Prayer's plans to counter-protest this earlier rally, local antifa groups organized a counter- protest of Patriot Prayer, calling this third rally \\"Call to Resist Patriot Prayer Bringing Nazis to Portland.\\" Pepper spray was used by a Multnomah County sheriff's deputy and by demonstrators. Police report that although there were several people who were evaluated medically at the parks, no one was transported to the hospital. On June 30, 2018, a Patriot Prayer rally that consisted of 150 supporters clashed with anti-fascists protesters who had been waiting for them at a barricaded street. Police observed ‚Äúassaults, criminal behavior, and projectiles being thrown\\". Reports suggest that the counter- protesters initiated the violence when they began assaulting the Patriot Prayer supporters with thrown projectiles. Subsequently, the permit to march through downtown Portland was revoked, and the police declared the Patriot Prayer rally a riot. The police fired non-lethal ammunition towards the counter-protestors and 9 people in all were arrested. A rally called the \\"Gibson for Senate Freedom March\\", including members of both Patriot Prayer and the Proud Boys, was held in Portland on August 4, 2018, along Tom McCall Waterfront Park.Mathias, Christopher (August 3, 2018) \\"Portland‚Äôs Patriot Prayer Rally Could Be Most Violent Since Charlottesville, Activists Say\\" Huffington Post It attracted counter-protestors, both from a coalition of labor unions, immigrant rights advocates, and other groups, and from local organized antifa activists. Hundreds of riot-geared policeman, from both the Portland Police and the Oregon State Police attempted to keep the two groups apart, using rubber bullets and flashbangs when protestors refused to move. At one point, the police forces came under attack from rocks and bottles. Police reported that they confiscated weapons including fireworks, long sticks, baseball bats, pepper spray and home-made shields. There were injuries, and arrests were made, but the police characterized the event as a \\"civil disturbance\\" and not a \\"riot\\". The event also featured people wearing T-shirts saying \\"Pinochet Did Nothing Wrong\\", with an image of people dropped from a helicopter and \\"RWDS\\" (Right-Wing Death Squad), both of which were also spotted in Charlottesville.\\"Patriot Prayer is dragging Antifa into an unwinnable PR War\\" Vice NewsLisa; Dowling, Jennifer; and Staff (August 4, 2018) \\"Police use force to keep opposing protests apart\\" KOIN News In October 2018, the Portland police announced that it had found members of the organization carrying loaded firearms on the roof of a parking garage overlooking the site of the August protest; the people carrying them had concealed carry permits. The police confiscated the weapons and made the people leave the roof. On November 17, 2018, an offshoot of Patriot Prayer scheduled a Him Too rally at Terry Schrunk Plaza in downtown Portland and was met with counter protestors.Kavanaugh, Shane Dixon (November 15, 2018) \\"Dueling demonstrations set for Portland days after protest ordinance fails\\" The OregonianMorris, Amanda (October 11, 2018) \\"#HimToo: Left And Right Embrace Opposing Takes On Same Hashtag\\" NPRZane, Sparling (November 17, 2018) https://pamplinmedia.com/pt/9-news/412439-313304-mayor-wheeler-takes-leash- off-police-joey-gibson-says In January 2019, Patriot Prayer leader Joey Gibson, Proud Boy Tusitala \\"Tiny\\" Toese and former Proud Boy Russell Schultz initiated a campaign to tear off the bandanas of antifa demonstrators and taking pictures of their faces. The announcement of the campaign came shortly after an altercation that took place when Patriot Prayer and Proud Boys members attempted and failed to invade a chapter meeting of the Democratic Socialists of America. The groups clashed with anti-fascist activists nearby after being denied entry to the meeting, and claimed to be attacked.  2019 May Day brawl  In August 2019, Gibson, along with five other Patriot Prayer affiliates were arrested for their actions in connection with a riot that took place in Portland on May 1. During the riot, which took place outside Cider Riot, Patriot Prayer member Ian Kramer beat Cider Riot patron Heather Clark unconscious and broke her vertebrae.Weill, Kelly (August 16, 2019) \\"Portland‚Äôs Feared Far-Right Rally Hit by Multiple Setbacks\\" The Daily BeastShepherd, Katie (August 15, 2019) \\"As Arrests Mount, At Least One Far- Right Paramilitary Group Has Bailed Out of the Aug. 17 Rally in Portland\\" Willamette WeekShepherd, Katie (August 15, 2019) \\"Patriot Prayer Leader Joey Gibson Will Face Criminal Charges In May Day Riot, His Lawyer Says\\" Willamette Week A Navy veteran referred to as \\"Ben\\", who had infiltrated Patriot Prayer and took videos of the violence at their rallies, was expected to testify at Gibson's trial.Zielinsky, Alex (August 26, 2019) \\"Undercover in Patriot Prayer: Insights From a Vancouver Democrat Who's Been Working Against the Far- Right Group from the Inside\\" Portland Mercury = Seattle area = Patriot Prayer in Seattle on May 1, 2017 On May 1, 2017, Patriot Prayer counter- protested at Seattle's May Day parade with their \\"Stand Against Communism\\" rally. The events were mostly peaceful with arrests of counter protesters. On June 15, 2017, Patriot Prayer members held a rally at Evergreen State College, timed to coincide with one by the Evergreen Anti-Fascist Community Defense Network. The former promoted solidarity with Bret Weinstein, whose critical comments about an event for racial awareness had ignited campus protests. On August 13, 2017, the group held the \\"Freedom Rally Seattle\\" at Westlake Park with a large police presence to keep thousands of counter-protesters away. The concurrent events came one day after the death and injuries in the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville and tensions were high with arrests of counter protesters made by police. On February 10, 2018, Patriot Prayer was invited by the University of Washington College Republicans to speak at their \\"Freedom Rally\\" in Red Square. Several groups organized counter-protests, leading to skirmishes. Five people were arrested. On August 18, 2018, Patriot Prayer and the Washington Three Percenters held a \\"Liberty or Death\\" rally in Seattle. The right-wing supporters, some armed and in tactical gear, were met with a counter protest from Organized Workers for Labor Solidarity, Radical Women and the Freedom Socialist Party. Three people were arrested. = San Francisco Bay area = A rally which was to be held at Crissy Field in San Francisco on August 26, 2017 was cancelled by Gibson. In response to allegations by Nancy Pelosi that the event was intended to be a \\"white supremacist rally\\", Gibson said: \\"For those of you who believe we are seriously going to throw a white nationalist supremacist rally in San Francisco, it's time for logic.\\" In a video posted to his Facebook page. Gibson said: \\"We have a black speaker, two Hispanic speakers, we've got an Asian, a brown speaker right here (referring to himself) ‚Äì we got a transsexual, and we aren't talking about race.\\" Mayor Ed Lee had also condemned the event. Police Chief Bill Scott and Board of Supervisors President London Breed had written a letter expressing outrage over the National Park Service's decision to allow the rally. Security for the event was to be handled by the Oath Keepers. On August 26, 2017, news of a planned Patriot Prayer press conference in San Francisco's Alamo Square Park drew over 1,000 counter-protesters to the neighborhood. The group, which had already canceled a planned rally at Crissy Field due to alleged safety concerns, held the press conference in Pacifica instead. The hastily organized press conference had not gotten a permit for the event, leading to the city fencing off Alamo Square, barring entry to the public. Prior to the event, the group's leader Joey Gibson denounced white supremacists before an August 2017 rally, saying: \\"Don't show up, you're not welcome.\\" Group organizers arrived at Crissy Field later that afternoon to talk with counter-protesters. Counter- protests across the city that weekend were peaceful, with most counter- protesters opting to hold a large dance party instead of a violent confrontation, and there was only one arrest for public intoxication. After cancelling the August 26 event at Alamo Square, Gibson then said that Patriot Prayer members would instead be attending an anti-Marxist rally in nearby Berkeley, but also called that event off as well. A September 26, 2017 Patriot Prayer demonstration near Sproul Plaza resulted in violence between the group and left-wing activists, including BAMN. The demonstration continued in a march to People's Park, where Kyle \\"Stickman\\" Chapman, a self-described American nationalist, claimed there was \\"a war on whites\\" and a \\"battle for Berkeley\\". Police made three arrests, including Yvette Felarca.  Relationship with the Portland police  Patriot Prayer gather in 2017, Tusitala \\"Tiny\\" Toese in center The Guardian reported that Lt. Niiya told Gibson in December 2017 that the police would not execute a warrant for the arrest of Toese. In a text, Niiya wrote: \\"Just make sure he doesn‚Äôt do anything which may draw our attention. [...] If he still has the warrant in the system (I don‚Äôt run you guys so I don‚Äôt personally know) the officers could arrest him. I don‚Äôt see a need to arrest on the warrant unless there is a reason.\\" He also indicated that police officers had ignored previous arrest warrants for Toese. In February 2019, Willamette Week reported that Portland police lieutenant Jeff Niiya kept in close touch with Gibson, passing on to him intelligence about the anti-fascist movement in the city. He also advised Gibson on how a Patriot Prayer member could avoid being arrested.Weill, Kelly (February 15, 2019) \\"Antifa: Portland Police 'Protect White Supremacy' by Passing Intel to Patriot Prayer\\" The Daily Beast On February 21, a public \\"listening session\\" convened by the Portland Police Bureau consisted in large part of strong criticism of the bureau. On March 1, 2019, The Guardian reported that it had obtained video which showed Portland police officers approaching Patriot Prayer leader Joey Gibson at a June 3, 2018 rally, and telling him that even though Niiya had probable cause to arrest several members of the group, they could avoid being arrested by leaving. The officers informed Gibson of who would be arrested (Tusitala \\"Tiny\\" Toese and another man) and told him that they had already arrested members of \\"the other side\\". Five days after the rally, Toese and Donovan Flippo, a member of the Proud Boys, allegedly attacked a man in Portland. They were later indicted for the incident by a grand jury. The Portland Police Bureau did not comment on the video because their investigation on the relationship between Niiya and Patriot Prayer is ongoing.Wilson, James (March 1, 2019) \\"Exclusive: video shows Portland officers made deal with far-right group leader \\" The Guardian Portland's Independent Police Review investigated Niiya and cleared him in September 2019, determining that he was gathering information on the groups and trying to defuse potential clashes with his advice.

The riots began in Panchkula and later spread to other parts of the northern Indian states of Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and the capital, New Delhi.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dera-violence- chargesheet-against-honeypreet-14-others/articleshow/61838629.cms At least 41 people were killed, the majority of them in Panchkula, where 32 people were allegedly killed by police gunfire. Quote: \\"Haryana DGP B.S. Sandhu said there were 38 casualties so far, out of which 32 died in Panchkula and six in Sirsa.\\" More than 300 others were injured. Background Beginning 23 August 2017, parts of Haryana, Punjab and Chandigarh were put under a security lockdown as 200,000 supporters of Ram Rahim amassed in Panchkula ahead of the verdict. A heavy contingent of security was deployed for the verdict including 97 Central Reserve Police Force companies; 16 Rapid Action Force; 37 Sashastra Seema Bal; 12 Indo-Tibetan Border Police and 21 Border Security Force companies. Another 10 companies were kept on standby. The authorities had suspended internet services for 48 hours and Section 144 of the Indian penal code (prohibiting an assembly of more than four people) was imposed in Sri Ganganagar, Rajasthan (Ram Rahim's birth-village) in advance of the verdict announcement. Electricity was cut in a few residential areas in Panchkula as a precautionary measure. On 25 August 2017, around 15:00 (IST), a special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court in Panchkula, Haryana, delivered its verdict in a 2002 sexual assault case of two sadhvis (female followers) of Dera Sacha Sauda. The court found Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, the Dera Sacha Sauda chief ‚Äî known as \\"the guru of bling\\" ‚Äî guilty of rape. The sentence was scheduled to be pronounced on 28 August 2017. He faced a minimum of seven years' imprisonment. Before the verdict, Ram Rahim appealed to his followers to remain calm, after having made the 250 km (156 mi) journey from the sect's headquarters in Sirsa to Panchkula in a 100-vehicle convoy. Soon afterwards, Ram Rahim's 'Z+ security cover' was withdrawn. He was one of only 36 people in India under that level of government-provided security cover. Ram Rahim was later taken into judicial custody and was reportedly moved to the Western Command Headquarters in Chandimandir Cantonment. Later, he was flown by helicopter to a jail in the nearby town of Rohtak. After the verdict, Ram Rahim supporters were evicted from Panchkula and Chandigarh. Police and paramilitary forces used tear gas shelling in Sector 3, Panchkula, to control Dera supporters which led to clashes. Violence Following the conviction, his supporters went on a rampage setting fire to vehicles, government buildings, petrol stations, media vans and railway stations. Ram Rahim's followers took to streets brandishing sticks and throwing rocks upon hearing news of his conviction. According to an Indian Railways spokesman, two railway stations were burnt in (Malout and Balluanna) Punjab and two empty train coaches of Rewa Express were set on fire in Delhi's Anand Vihar station. The arsonists also attempted to set fire to Dagru railway station. PTC News reporters were attacked and a video journalist went missing since the assault. The rioters attacked the NDTV channel's OB Van and injured an engineer. An India Today TV crew was attacked and its cameraman injured in Sirsa. Its OB van was also attacked by rioters in Panchkula. An Income Tax Department's building and two police vehicles were set on fire in Mansa, Punjab. Twenty- eight vehicles were burnt in Panchkula, including some belonging to the government. A telephone exchange was torched by the protesters in Chananwal in Punjab's Barnala district. A sewa kendra was set ablaze near Faridkot. A Vita milk plant and a power substation were damaged in Sirsa.http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/in-sirsa-4-killed-6-hurt-in- police-firing/457419.html According to Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, 7 people from Punjab died in the clashes. He further stated that in Punjab, 52 minor incidents took place barring the incident when a railway station was burnt. At least 32 people were killed in Panchkula and six others were killed in Sirsa in India's northern Haryana state. More than 300 people were injured in the violence after police and paramilitary forces fired on charged mobs. Police fired tear gas, water cannons and live ammunition while trying to disperse the mobs in Panchkula and near DSS ashram in Sirsa. By 7:00 pm (local time), the violence subsided in Panchkula. According to Haryana's Director General of Police, some 10,000 followers of Ram Rahim remained holed up in the DSS headquarters, where security forces were kept on \\"standby\\". Response Curfews were imposed in several areas of Chandigarh city and across the state of Punjab. A number of towns were placed under curfew including; Panchkula, Sirsa, Kaithal, Faridpur and Malout. The border between the states of Haryana and Punjab was sealed. By around 9:55 pm (local time), curfew had been imposed in 8 districts of Punjab namely ‚Äî Mansa, Bathinda, Firozpur, Faridkot, Fazilka, Patiala, Barnala and Sangrur. The Indian army was called in and about 600 soldiers were deployed in the city of Panchkula to help restore order. According to the Indian army sources, six columns of army personnel were deployed in Panchkula and two columns in Sirsa in Haryana. While, one column of army personnel was deployed in Punjab's Mansa and another column in Mukhtsar. Section 144 was imposed in parts of Delhi, and in towns of Shamli, Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat, Noida and Ghaziabad. By around 8:00 pm (local time), Section 144 was also imposed in Sri Ganganagar and Hanumangarh districts of northern Rajasthan. Until 10:00 pm (local time), Section 144 had been imposed in 9 districts of Uttar Pradesh ‚Äî Meerut, Saharanpur, Shamli, Muzaffarnagar, Ghaziabad, Noida, Bulandshahar, Bagpat and Hapur. It was also imposed in eleven districts of Delhi including in New Delhi till 8 September 2017 and in Uttarakhand's Nainital. Following the violence in Panchkula, almost 250 trains to Rohtak Junction were cancelled. Mobile internet and data services remained suspended in Haryana, Punjab and Chandigarh for the next 72 hours. The deputy commissioner in Panchkula requested the district Red Cross Society to send in their trained volunteers. All Delhi Metro stations were kept on alert. The Delhi Petrol Pump Association announced closure of at least 12 fuel stations near the Haryana border in Delhi as a preemptive measure. Delhi Transport Corporation suspended its bus services to the National Capital Region due to incidents of arson. The Delhi‚ÄìLahore Bus service was suspended as well. Bagpat district Magistrate directed all schools in the region to remain closed on 26 August. On 26 August 2017, police sealed the nine congregation centres of the Dera Sacha Sauda in the Kurukshetra district and recovered 2,500 wooden sticks, some sharp-edged weapons and 2.5 litres (0.55 imp gal; 0.66 US gal) of kerosene during the search operation. Aftermath Three people were arrested in connection with arson in Delhi. According to the Advocate General of Punjab 19 rioters had been arrested including Gurdev Singh, a state-level office bearer of Dera Sacha Sauda. According to a Haryana administrator, more than 500 people had been arrested. According to a Haryana police official, more than 1,000 of the guru's supporters had been detained in Panchkula on charges of arson and destruction of public property. After the rioting spread, a court ordered the seizure of the DSS ashram and other properties in compensation for the widespread destruction of public and private property. According to Haryana's Chief Secretary, D. S. Dhesi, Haryana Police registered two sedition cases when \\"one AK 47, one mouser, five pistols and two rifles\\" were recovered from two vehicles that were part of the convoy accompanying Ram Rahim. According to the Haryana Advocate General, twenty-four vehicles were seized and ten petrol bombs were also recovered. A special hearing was held in the Punjab and Haryana High Court for monitoring the law and order situation in the region and other related issues following the riots. According to Secretary Dhesi, all the 36 people killed on 25 August were Dera Sacha Sauda followers, who were killed by police gunfire and stampedes. Some lawyers objected to use of lethal bullets by police and filed a petition to request use of pellets to disperse the protesting mobs. But the High Court bench rejected the plea because mobs armed with petrol bombs and other weapons had created a war-like situation. Police recovered 85 cartons of explosives that used to make fireworks during a raid on an illegal fireworks factory owned by the DSS.https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/on-day-2-of-raids-illegal-explosive- factory-found-inside-dera-campus-1748042 Reaction The President of India, Ram Nath Kovind tweeted, \\"Violence and damage to public property after court verdict is highly condemnable; appeal to all citizens to maintain peace\\". Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi condemned the violence and urged \\"everyone to maintain peace\\". While reviewing the situation with the National Security Advisor and the Home Secretary, he asked officials to \\"work round the clock to restore normalcy and provide all possible assistance that is required\\". Chief Minister of Haryana, Manohar Lal Khattar (BJP) admitted that there were lapses but asserted appropriate action was being taken. According to Chief Minister of Punjab Amarinder Singh, the fault in this mayhem lay with allowing people to gather, adding that \\"this sort of reaction was anticipated\\".

Ericson's father's inheritance served as seed capital for starting the company. Together with pewter artist Nils Fougstedt, she produced modern pewter objects and thus Svenskt Tenn quickly gained recognition as a brand of quality, eventually leading to a gold medal at the 1925 Exposition des Arts D√©coratifs et Industriels in Paris. Further successes in the USA were following, beginning in 1927 with an exhibition of Swedish design at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York that also toured to Chicago and Detroit.Christopher Long: Josef Frank: Life and Work, University of Chicago Press 2002, p. 299. As a result of her success, in 1927, the store moved from Sm√•landsgatan to larger premises on Strandv√§gen, where it is still located today. At that time, the Swedish functionalist architects Uno √Öhr√©n and Bj√∂rn Tr√§g√•rdh started to design for the company. In 1932, Ericson ordered the first furniture designs from the already well-established Austrian architect Josef Frank. Two years later, she hired Frank after he fled the burgeoning Nazism in Austria for Sweden at the age of 50 together with his Swedish wife Anna. Svenskt Tenn's exhibition room at the world exhibitions in Paris (‚ÄúExposition des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne‚Äù) in 1937 and New York in 1939 was completely contrary to the ideal of the time with its bold contrasts in materials, colours and prints. The duo of Frank and Ericson received a great deal of attention and were quickly associated with the expression ‚ÄúSwedish Modern‚Äù.Jonathan Woodham: A Dictionary of Modern Design, Oxford University Press 2004 Over time, the designer duo won many notable clients. In 1932, Sigvard Oskar Bernadotte commissioned Svenskt Tenn for a new interior design of his residence. Similarly, Ericson and Frank were commissioned to design the house of Anne Hedmark (Annes Hus) on the site of the Swedish sculptor Carl Milles‚Äôs studio and home. During the Second World War, Josef Frank was forced into exile yet again. At the height of the war he fled to Manhattan, resulting in a number of new textile designs between 1941 and 1946. Sweden‚Äôs Prince Eugen was among those who took a great delight in them; he felt that the new designs actually exceeded those of the legendary print designer and Frank role model, William Morris. After Frank died in 1967, Ericson ran the daily operations of the business until 1975. At the age of 81, she sold the company to the Kjell and M√§rta Beijer Foundation, which provides research grants within ecology, medicine and the preservation of Swedish interior design tradition. Ericson, however, remained as the managing director of the company. In 1979, Ann Wall took over her role and transformed Svenskt Tenn into a profitable business by modernising the product range, administration and organization, as well as renewing the marketing concept. Collaborations with selected new designers, as well as art and design schools, were also established under her direction. = 1999 ‚Äì today = After Wall‚Äôs retirement twenty years later, the Kjell and M√§rta Beijer Foundation established the Ann Wall Design Prize in her honor as a part of Svenskt Tenn‚Äôs new business concept, which was ‚Äúto preserve the spirit of Estrid Ericson and Josef Frank in a modern form.‚Äù In that context, the foundation in 2015 bought Frank's residence Villa Carlsten in Falsterbo, a town located at the southwestern tip of Sweden in Vellinge Municipality in Sk√•ne. Frank had also designed a number of summer houses in that area. Today, eighty percent of Svenskt Tenn's range consists of products that are of its own design. Josef Frank alone left behind 2,000 furniture sketches and about 160 textile designs. In 2009, Prince Carl Philip of Sweden debuted a silver cutlery collection at Svenskt Tenn.Press release of the Swedish Court: CPB 2091 ‚Äì ett svenskt silverbestick med internationell karakt√§r 2017 The following year, he presented a fireplace screen that he had co-designed.Press release of the Swedish Court: Prins Carl Philip lanserar eldsk√§rm Frank's designs are highly esteemed not the least among today's young and established designers and his textiles are a source of inspiration for many contemporary print designers both in Sweden and other countries.

The town of Queenborough lies around to the east across the West Swale channel.

It is believed that the remains are those of men and boys who died of disease on board prison hulks, floating prisons that were moored in the area around 200 years ago.

Biden, the vice president of the United States from 2009 to 2017 and a former U.S. senator from Delaware, had been the subject of widespread speculation as a potential 2020 candidate after declining to be a candidate in the 2016 election. Biden is generally described as a moderate, although he has recently described himself as progressive. His positions include codifying Roe v. Wade into statute, a public option for health insurance, decriminalization of recreational cannabis, passing the Equality Act, free community college, and a $1.7 trillion climate plan embracing the framework of the Green New Deal. He supports regulation as opposed to a complete ban on fracking. As a former vice president, Biden entered the race with very high name recognition. From his campaign announcement up to the start of the elections, he had been the candidate most identified as the Democratic front-runner. He led most national polls through 2019, but did not rank as one of the top three candidates in either the Iowa causes or the New Hampshire primary. On February 29, 2020, he won a landslide victory in the 2020 South Carolina Democratic primary which reinvigorated his campaign. In March 2020, ten of his former competitors endorsed Biden, bringing the total number of such endorsements to 12. Biden earned enough delegates on Super Tuesday 2020 to pull ahead of Senator Bernie Sanders. On April 8, after Sanders suspended his campaign, Biden became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. In June, Biden reached the required number of delegates to become the nominee. On August 11, Biden announced that Senator Kamala Harris would be his vice presidential running mate. On August 18 and 19, Biden and Harris were officially nominated at the 2020 Democratic National Convention, making Harris the first Asian American and the first female African American to be nominated for vice president on a major party ticket. National opinion polls conducted in 2020 have generally shown Biden leading Trump in favorability. Background =Previous presidential campaigns= Biden's 2020 presidential campaign is his third attempt to seek election for president of the United States. His first campaign was made in the 1988 Democratic Party primaries where he was initially considered one of the potentially strongest candidates. However, newspapers revealed plagiarism by Biden in law school records and in speeches, a scandal which led to his withdrawal from the race in September 1987. He made the second attempt during the 2008 Democratic Party primaries, where he focused on his plan to achieve political success in the Iraq War through a system of federalization. Like his first presidential bid, Biden failed to garner endorsements and support. He withdrew from the race after his poor performance in the Iowa caucus on January 3, 2008. He was eventually chosen by Barack Obama as his running mate and won the general election as vice president of the United States, being sworn in on January 20, 2009. =Speculation= Vice President Joe Biden was seen as a potential candidate to succeed Barack Obama in the 2016 presidential election. On October 21, 2015, following the death of his son Beau, Biden announced that he would not seek the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. During a tour of the United States Senate with reporters on December 5, 2016, Biden refused to rule out a potential bid for the presidency in the 2020 presidential election. He reasserted his ambivalence about running on an appearance of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on December 7, in which he stated \\"never say never\\" about running for president in 2020, while also admitting he did not see a scenario in which he would run for office again. He seemingly announced on January 13, 2017, exactly one week prior to the expiration of his vice presidential term, that he would not run. However, four days later, he seemed to backtrack, stating \\"I'll run if I can walk.\\" In September 2017, Biden's daughter Ashley indicated her belief that he was thinking about running in 2020. =Time for Biden= 130px Time for Biden, a political action committee, was formed in January 2018, seeking Biden's entry into the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries. The PAC was created by Matthew Graf of Rock Island, Illinois, and Collin West of East Moline, Illinois. Although it sought Biden's entry into the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, it was not affiliated with or sponsored by Biden himself. The founders also stated that if Biden announced, a run of the committee said resources would be merged with the campaign. The organization was criticized by some, who felt it was created too early and that Democratic effort should be spent on the 2018 midterm elections. =Considering his options= In February 2018, Biden informed a group of longtime foreign policy aides that he was \\"keeping his 2020 options open\\". In March 2018, Politico reported that Biden's team was considering a number of options to distinguish their campaign, such as announcing at the outset a younger vice presidential candidate from outside of politics, and also reported that Biden had rejected a proposition to commit to serving only one term as president. On July 17, 2018, he told a forum held in Bogota, Colombia, that he would decide if he would formally declare as a candidate by January 2019. On February 4, with no decision having been forthcoming from Biden, Edward-Isaac Dovere of The Atlantic wrote that Biden was \\"very close to saying yes\\" but that some close to him are worried he will have a last-minute change of heart, as he did in 2016. Dovere reported that Biden was concerned about the effect another presidential run could have on his family and reputation, as well as fundraising struggles and perceptions about his age and relative centrism compared to other declared and potential candidates. Conversely, his \\"sense of duty\\", offense at the Trump presidency, the lack of foreign policy experience among other Democratic hopefuls and his desire to foster \\"bridge-building progressivism\\" in the party were said to be factors prompting him to run. Campaign =Announcement= The campaign's original logo, used prior to Harris's selection as running mate. Biden speaking at the camapaign's kickoff event in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania On March 12, 2019, he told a gathering of his supporters he may need their energy \\"in a few weeks\\". Five days later, Biden accidentally revealed that he would be a candidate at a dinner in Dover, Delaware. On April 19, 2019, The Atlantic reported that Biden planned to officially announce his campaign five days later via a video announcement, followed by a launch rally in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, or Charlottesville, Virginia. In the days before his expected launch, several major Democratic donors received requests to donate to his campaign committee, to be named \\"Biden for President\\". Subsequent reports indicated that Biden's plans remained uncertain, with no known launch date, locations for campaign rallies, or permits for an event in Philadelphia; associates continued to plan a fundraiser on April 25 in Philadelphia hosted by Comcast executive vice president David L. Cohen, but it was unclear whether the fundraiser would be held as planned, though his associates had continued to solicit donations in the days leading up to his announcement. On April 23, it was reported that Biden would formally enter the race two days later, so as to avoid overshadowing a forum focusing on women of color held the day before. The campaign reserved the Teamsters Local 249 union hall in Pittsburgh for April 29. Biden released a video formally announcing his campaign early on April 25, 2019. On May 22, the magazine Ebony reported that Biden had begun assembling his 2020 presidential campaign team, to be headquartered in Philadelphia. His team includes campaign manager Greg Schultz and director of strategic communications Kamau Mandela Marshall, who both previously worked in the Obama administration, as well as other senior advisors from the Obama administration. Additionally, on May 31, the Biden campaign announced that Congressman Cedric Richmond would join the campaign as the national co- chairman. =Fundraising and strategy= Campaigning in Marshalltown, Iowa On April 26, 2019, Biden's campaign announced that they had raised $6.3 million in the first 24 hours, surpassing all other candidates' first 24-hour fundraising totals for the Democratic presidential nomination at that time. Biden's fundraising came from 128,000 unique contributors, equivalent to that of Beto O'Rourke's campaign, but about 40% lower than that of Bernie Sanders, who had 223,000 unique contributors in the first 24 hours of his campaign. According to a Politico article, the Biden campaign is running a campaign on the premise that the Democratic base is not nearly as liberal or youthful as perceived. Privately, several Biden advisers acknowledge that their theory is based on polling data and voting trends, contending that the media is pushing the idea of a hyper-progressive Democratic electorate being propagated by a Twitter bubble and being out of touch with the average rank-and-file Democrat. In April 2019, Biden told reporters, \\"The fact of the matter is the vast majority of the members of the Democratic Party are still basically liberal to moderate Democrats in the traditional sense.\\" Biden also described himself as an \\"Obama-Biden Democrat\\". An unspecified Biden adviser said, \\"There's a big disconnect between the media narrative and what the primary electorate looks like and thinks, versus the media narrative and the Twitter narrative [and] the Democratic primary universe is far less liberal. It's older than you think it is.\\" From April 25 to May 25, 2019, Biden's campaign spent 83% of his total $1.2 million Facebook ad funding on targeting voters 45 years and older. No other top 2020 Democratic candidate has pursued a similar strategy in the primary. Biden, along with Bernie Sanders, has often been perceived as the candidate with the best chance of defeating Donald Trump in the general election. According to The Washington Post, this may be because of his more moderate policies, or it may be because voters or party leaders believe a white male candidate is more \\"electable\\". Joe Biden said that his late son Beau should be running instead of him if he were alive. Biden led most national polls through 2019. The campaign raised $70 million during the 2020 Democratic National Convention. The campaign and DNC combined raised a record $365 million in August 2020, compared to $154 million by Trump and the RNC. Biden raised another $383 million in September 2020, breaking his own record from the previous month. = Early primary election results = Biden speaking at a campaign event in Des Moines, Iowa During the Iowa caucuses held on February 3, 2020, Biden came in fourth place, earning six pledged delegates. In the New Hampshire primary held on February 11, Biden came in fifth place and did not earn any delegates due to his failure to meet the required 15% eligibility threshold. After poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, some media outlets questioned whether Biden's status as the most electable candidate was accurate. Biden speaking to voters in Iowa Biden won the South Carolina primary election held on February 29. Biden won all 46 counties in the state, winning 48.7% of the popular vote and earning 39 delegates. The win was largely attributed to his support from 61% of African-American voters (African-American voters make up approximately 60% of the Democratic electorate in South Carolina). Before the primary on February 26, Jim Clyburn endorsed Biden. Many cited Clyburn's endorsement as a reason for Biden's wide margin of victory, as Clyburn's endorsement is a deciding factor for many African American voters in South Carolina. Thirty-six percent of all primary voters said that they made their decision after Clyburn's endorsement; of that total, 70% voted for Biden. According to FiveThirtyEight, the outcome significantly boosted Biden's chance of winning multiple Super Tuesday states (especially southern states like North Carolina, Texas, and Virginia). On the Super Tuesday primary elections on March 3, Biden won Alabama, Arkansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia, earning a total of 458 delegates, and pulling ahead of Bernie Sanders in the race. According to an exit poll, Biden received a substantial amount of support from voters who made up their minds in the last few days before the election. Late voters also preferred a candidate who they believed could defeat Trump more than one who agreed with them on issues. In early March, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, and Michael Bloomberg dropped out of the race and endorsed Biden.Bloomberg ends his bid for the Democratic nomination, endorses Joe Biden By Rebecca Moran, USA Today, March 4, 2020 Beto O'Rourke, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, who both suspended their campaign months before, also endorsed him. On March 9, CNN reported that Biden had a double- digit lead over Sanders in a nationwide poll. In mid-March, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of the scheduled primaries were postponed. Aides to both Biden's and Sanders's campaigns were in contact regarding the pandemic and its effects. =Nomination= Leading up to the 11th Democratic presidential debate, Biden announced two new progressive policies: making public colleges and universities tuition-free for students of families whose income is less than $125,000, and allowing for student loan debts to default during bankruptcy. The debate was held on March 15, 2020, and was the first to feature only the race's two lead finalists. Biden announced that if he secured the nomination, he would choose a female running mate, having previously hinted as much by naming several contenders. On April 3, Biden announced that his campaign would unveil a committee to vet prospective vice presidential candidates later in the month. On March 25, when asked whether he would debate Sanders again, Biden said, \\"My focus is just dealing with this crisis right now. I haven't thought about any more debates. I think we've had enough debates. I think we should get on with this.\\" On April 8, after Sanders suspended his campaign, Biden became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. The next day, a former Senate staffer made a sexual assault allegation against Biden, which his campaign denied. On May 1, Biden stated that the allegation was false and requested that the secretary of the Senate work with the National Archives and Records Administration to identify and release any relevant documents. On April 13, Bernie Sanders endorsed Joe Biden, and the two announced the formation of several task forces to work out shared policy solutions. On May 13, Biden and Sanders announced that the six task forces would be co-chaired by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, former Secretary of State John Kerry, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, NILC director Marielena Hincapi√©, Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, AFA president Sara Nelson, Rep. Karen Bass, civil rights attorney Chiraag Bains, Rep. Bobby Scott, Dr. Heather Gautney, and Rep. Marcia Fudge. By June 9, Biden had enough delegates to secure his nomination as the Democratic candidate. On July 4, musician and entrepreneur Kanye West announced his campaign for the presidency. The Los Angeles Times wrote that this \\"might be part of an effort to draw Black supporters away from Biden to help Trump.\\" On July 8, Biden's campaign released a set of policy recommendations adopted by the Unity Task Forces appointed by him and Bernie Sanders. The recommendations focus on climate change, criminal justice, the economy, education, health care, and immigration. Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris at the first campaign event of the ticket, on August 12, 2020 On August 5, it was reported that Biden would accept the Democratic nomination from his home state of Delaware due to the pandemic. On August 11, he announced that Kamala Harris would be his running mate. The next day, the two made their first public appearance together promoting their mutual campaigns. On August 18, the second night of the 2020 Democratic National Convention, the party officially nominated Biden, making him the first former vice president to be nominated for president since Walter Mondale in 1984. Biden accepted the nomination two nights later. Chris Wallace of Fox News Sunday called Biden's acceptance speech \\"enormously effective\\" and said he \\"blew a big hole\\" in Trump's characterization of the candidate as being \\"mentally shot.\\" During the convention, delegates adopted the party platform, which was drafted by a committee of many of the same people from the unity task forces and based on the recommendations issued by those task forces. =Presidential debates= Since Biden's successful nomination in the Democratic primaries Trump attempted to cast doubt over Biden's abilities, claiming that he was suffering from dementia and that he was taking performance enhancing drugs in the primaries. Trump called for Biden to be drug tested before the presidential debate; Biden declined. Trump also claimed that Biden would use a hidden electronic earpiece for the debate, demanding that Biden's ears be searched. Again, Biden declined. The first debate took place at Cleveland Clinic on September 29. It was moderated by Chris Wallace. Debate topics included Trump's and Biden's records, the economy, the COVID-19 pandemic, race relations, and the Supreme Court nomination of Amy Coney Barrett. Each speaker was to have two minutes to state their positions followed with a period of discussion. The debate quickly devolved into cross talk and interruptions and was widely criticized as being a low point in U.S. presidential politics. Although Wallace pleaded multiple times with Trump to follow the agreed-upon debate rules, Trump frequently interrupted and spoke over Biden and at times with Wallace as well. Following the debate Wallace stated that while his own family and the Biden family wore masks as had been required for those in attendance, the Trump family did not and refused the masks offered to them by Cleveland Clinic staffers. The vice presidential debate between Harris and Pence took place as scheduled on October 7 with Susan Page serving as moderator. The debate was generally seen as civil although there were frequent instances of both candidates interrupting while the other was speaking, with Harris interrupting only about half as often as Pence. Pence also repeatedly spoke beyond his allotted time, ignoring Page's attempts of asking him to mind the two-minute time limits. A CNN poll of registered voters found that 59% felt Harris had won, while 38% felt Pence to be the winner. Two further presidential debates were scheduled to take place on October 15 and 22, but the first was cancelled in light of the White House COVID-19 outbreak and Trump's declared intention not to participate in a virtual debate. In response to Trump's refusal to debate Biden scheduled a town hall on ABC for October 15; Trump then scheduled a town hall as well, on the same date and at the same time, to be broadcast on NBC, MSNBC, and CNBC. According to Nielsen ratings, nearly 700,000 more viewers watched Biden‚Äôs town hall than those who watched Trump‚Äôs, even though Trump appeared on three outlets. = Final month = On October 6, Biden made a campaign speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, called \\"the best of his campaign\\" by CNN's John Avlon. On October 15, both Biden and Trump held separate town hall speeches, replacing the cancelled second debate. Polling Opinion polls conducted in 2020 have generally shown Biden leading Trump nationally in general election matchups, with the former vice president's advantage often extending beyond that of the survey's margin of sampling error. On July 4, Politico reported that Biden was leading Trump \\"by double digits in recent polls\\". In late July, a Washington Post‚ÄìABC News poll showed Biden's double-digit lead holding. A national poll conducted in early August showed Biden leading by three percent. An Iowa poll showed Trump leading Biden by 48% to 45%, which is six percentage points less than Trump won the state with in 2016. Three national polls released August 13‚Äì17 show Biden polling ahead of Trump: Fox News has him leading Trump 49% to 42%, NBC/Wall Street Journal has him leading 50% to 41%, and Washington Post/ABC News has him 53% to 41%. A Pew Research Center showed similar results, but found that a majority of participants believed that Trump would win. A Washington Post/ABC News poll taken in late September showed Biden and Harris's lead to be 53% to 43%. In late September, FiveThirtyEight predicted that Biden will win 352 of 538 electoral votes, with odds currently 76.7% that he will win the election. A NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll conducted September 30 ‚Äì October 1 (after the presidential debate, but before Trump's announcement of his COVID-19 diagnosis) has Biden leading 53% to 39%. By October 3, FiveThirtyEight had increased its odds of Biden winning the election to 81%. On October 7, a CNN poll showed Biden leading 57% to 41%, and a week later, Opinium Research/The Guardian showed him leading 57% to 40%. As of October 13, Biden has consistently led in poll averages by several or more points for over 100 days, as compared to the last four presidential elections. Endorsements As tracked by FiveThirtyEight, Biden has received the most support from prominent members of the Democratic Party out of all Democratic candidates in the 2020 presidential election. Biden has received endorsements from 12 former candidates in the 2020 race, including Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Michael Bloomberg, Tulsi Gabbard, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Beto O'Rourke, Andrew Yang, and others. On April 14, 2020, after Biden was the only remaining major candidate for the Democratic nomination, former president Barack Obama endorsed him. On April 27, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi endorsed him. On April 28, former 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton endorsed him. Biden has increasingly attracted Republican support away from their party's incumbent leader, Donald Trump. On August 17, an ad from Republican Voters Against Trump aired featuring Miles Taylor, former chief of staff to former homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. Taylor concludes in the ad, \\"Given what I experienced in the [Trump] administration, I have to support Joe Biden for president.\\" In late August, a movement called Republicans for Biden was launched with sponsorship by 25 former Republican congresspeople, and Politico reported that \\"Several dozen former staffers from Sen. Mitt Romney's (R-Utah) presidential campaign, the George W. Bush administration and the campaign and Senate staff of former Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) have signed on to an effort to elect Joe Biden.\\" By early September, over 175 current and former law enforcement officials had endorsed Biden. In September 2020, Scientific American announced its endorsement of Biden for president. In the almost 200 years that the journal has been in print it has never endorsed a presidential candidate. The magazine's endorsement reads: > The evidence and the science show that Donald Trump has badly damaged the > U.S. and its people‚Äîbecause he rejects evidence and science. The most > devastating example is his dishonest and inept response to the COVID-19 > pandemic, which cost more than 190,000 Americans their lives by the middle > of September. He has also attacked environmental protections, medical care, > and the researchers and public science agencies that help this country > prepare for its greatest challenges. That is why we urge you to vote for Joe > Biden, who is offering fact-based plans to protect our health, our economy > and the environment. These and other proposals he has put forth can set the > country back on course for a safer, more prosperous and more equitable > future. In October, the The New England Journal of Medicine, the oldest and considered to be the world's most prestigious medical magazine, published an editorial which condemned the Trump administration's handling of the coronavirus pandemic saying that \\"they have taken a crisis and turned it into a tragedy.\\" This is the first time in the journal's history that they have supported or condemned a political candidate. Political positions Although generally referred to as a moderate, Biden has declared himself as the candidate with the most progressive record. =Social issues= Abortion On May 21, 2019, a Biden campaign aide told the Associated Press that Biden would support immediate federal legislation codifying Roe v. Wade into statute. On June 5, 2019, the Biden campaign confirmed to NBC News that Biden still supports the Hyde Amendment, something no other Democratic presidential candidate came out in support of. Biden's campaign also told NBC News that Biden would be open to repealing the Hyde Amendment if abortion access protections currently under Roe v. Wade were threatened. On June 6, 2019, Biden, at the Democratic National Committee's African American Leadership Council Summit in Atlanta, Georgia, said he now supports repealing the Hyde Amendment, crediting his change in position, in part, to recent efforts by Republicans passing anti- abortion state laws, which he called \\"extreme laws\\". Also at the summit, he focused on economic inequality for African Americans, education access, criminal justice reform, healthcare, and voter suppression in the south. Cannabis Biden supports the decriminalization, but not legalization, of recreational cannabis usage. Biden said he believes no one should be in jail because of cannabis use. As president, he would decriminalize cannabis use and automatically expunge prior convictions. He supports the legalization of cannabis for medical purposes, leaving decisions regarding legalization for recreational use up to the states, and recategorizing cannabis as a Schedule II drug so researchers can study its impacts. Every other Democratic presidential candidate supported the full federal legalization of cannabis, with the exception of Michael Bloomberg, Steve Bullock and Joe Sestak. Capital punishment On June 20, 2019, following the first federal death sentence since 2003, Biden came out against capital punishment, supporting the repeal of both federal- and state-level death sentence statutes. He argued that with the death penalty, there is a risk of executing a wrongfully convicted person. Biden had previously supported capital punishment.Biden is labeled a moderate. But his agenda is far more liberal than Hillary Clinton's.  Education  In 2018, Biden said he supported a universal pre- kindergarten program. He unveiled a higher education plan in October 2019, which includes two years of guaranteed free community college or other training, and cuts to student loan obligations. Unlike some of his rivals, he initially did not support four years of free college tuition, but later reversed this for students of families whose income is less than $125,000, as well as allowing student loan debts to default during bankruptcy. Although the Obama administration promoted charter schools, Biden criticized some charter schools for funneling money away from public schools in a May 2019 speech, and said that he opposes federal funds for-profit charter schools. Immigration On July 5, 2019, Biden told CNN he did not support decriminalizing illegal entry into the United States, a position that puts him at odds with many of his 2020 Democratic rivals. He released a plan to reform the immigration system in December 2019, which includes a reversal of the Trump administration's deportation policies, a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and expansions in work visas and refugee admissions. LGBTQ issues On June 1, 2019, Biden gave a keynote address to hundreds of activists and donors at the Human Rights Campaign's annual Ohio gala. He declared his top legislative priority was passing the Equality Act. He attacked Donald Trump for banning transgender troops in the U.S. military, allowing individuals in the medical field to deny treating LGBTQ individuals, and allowing homeless shelters to deny transgender occupants. =Economic issues= Environment On June 4, 2019, the Biden campaign released a $1.7 trillion climate plan that embraced the framework of the Green New Deal. The plan called for the US to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 or earlier, and help coal workers to transition into jobs created from a clean-energy economy. Biden supports the development of carbon capture and storage and small modular reactors to reduce emissions. On September 4, 2019, during a CNN climate change town hall, Biden said he does not support banning fracking for natural gas, distancing himself from some of his Democratic presidential rivals, but said he would ban new fracking permits and evaluate existing ones to determine their safety. Health On July 16, 2019, Biden called for additional funding to construct rural hospitals, increase telehealth services in rural communities, and provide incentives for doctors to practice in rural areas, also known as medical deserts in the United States. On April 29, 2019, Biden came out in favor of a public option for health insurance and outlawing non- compete clauses for low-wage workers. Infrastructure Biden released his infrastructure plan on November 14, 2019, calling for investments of $1.3 trillion on infrastructure overhaul. The plan involves investments in the restoration of roads, bridges and highways, encouraging greater adoption of rail transport and electric vehicles. It also includes water pipe replacements, increases in broadband coverage, and updates to schools. Welfare On June 17, 2019, Biden appeared at the \\"Poor People's Campaign Presidential Forum\\" in Washington, D.C., to discuss proposals for the funding of poverty alleviation programs. At a fundraiser in New York the following day, he reassured wealthy donors that he would not \\"demonize\\" the rich and said, \\"no one's standard of living will change, nothing would fundamentally change.\\" Controversies =Comments on segregationists= While at a fundraiser on June 18, 2019, Biden said one of his greatest strengths was \\"bringing people together\\" and pointed to his relationships with senators James Eastland and Herman Talmadge, two segregationists, as examples. While imitating a Southern drawl, Biden remarked \\"I was in a caucus with James O. Eastland. He never called me 'boy,' he always called me 'son.'\\" Biden's Democratic opponents criticized the remarks, specifically the use of the word \\"boy\\". In response, Biden said that he was not meaning to use the term \\"boy\\" in its derogatory racial context. During the first Democratic presidential debate, Kamala Harris criticized Biden for his comments regarding his past work with segregationist senators and his past opposition to desegregation busing, which had allowed black children like her to attend integrated schools. Biden was widely criticized for his debate performance and support for him dropped 10 points. President Trump defended Biden, saying Harris was given \\"too much credit\\" for her debate with Biden. =Controversial remarks= Biden has a history of \\"verbal fumbles\\", which became an issue in the 2020 campaign. In 2018, Biden said he was \\"a gaffe machine\\" but disagreed with comparisons to Trump, saying his gaffe-prone nature was \\"a wonderful thing compared to a guy who can't tell the truth\\". On August 26, 2019, Biden addressed the controversy. After he stumbled over where he had spoken earlier that day, he looked directly at the assembled press and said, \\"I want to be clear: I'm not going nuts.\\" In December 2019, after a man asked him a question about Hunter Biden's ties to Ukraine, Biden called him a \\"damn liar\\" and \\"too old to vote for me\\". He also reportedly called him \\"fat\\", but the Biden campaign claimed he had said \\"look, facts\\", rather than \\"look, fat\\". A campaign spokesperson argued, \\"That's the kind of fire that we need\\" to beat Trump in the election. In February 2020, a university student asked Biden to explain why he had come fourth in the Iowa caucus when he had claimed to be the most electable candidate. Biden responded by asking her if she had ever been to a caucus before. She said yes, and he called her \\"a lying, dog-faced pony soldier\\", a phrase he has used before in reference to an unidentified, possibly nonexistent John Wayne film. In March 2020, Biden, when accused of being anti-gun rights, called the questioner \\"full of shit\\" and when further provoked, said, \\"Don't be such a horse's ass.\\" The NRA criticized Biden for saying that automatic guns, apparently including the semi-automatic AR-15, should be banned. A spokesman from Biden's campaign was pleased with the exchange. In May 2020, during an interview on The Breakfast Club radio show that CBS News described as \\"contentious\\", Biden remarked \\"If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black\\". He later apologized for his remarks. = False statements = In February, Biden claimed several times he was arrested in South Africa on his way to visit Nelson Mandela in prison. Biden faced scrutiny over the claim and later admitted he had not been arrested. In a virtual town hall with CNN on March 27, Biden said that the Trump administration had not made an effort to send U.S. medical experts to China to investigate the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019, a claim FactCheck.org characterized as false. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar had said at a January 28 press conference, \\"On January 6, we offered to send a CDC team to China that could assist with these public health efforts.\\" In May 2020, Biden stated he has been endorsed by NAACP, a claim the organization denied. =Trump‚ÄìUkraine scandal= In 2019, Trump allegedly attempted to coerce Ukraine and other foreign countries to investigate Joe Biden's son Hunter. Trump enlisted surrogates within and outside his official administration, including his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr, to pressure Ukraine and other foreign governments to cooperate in supporting conspiracy theories concerning American politics. Trump blocked but later released payment of a congressionally mandated $400 million military aid package to allegedly obtain quid pro quo cooperation from Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine. A number of contacts were established between the White House and the government of Ukraine, culminating in a phone call between Trump and Zelensky on July 25, 2019. The scandal resulted in Trump's impeachment on charges of abusing the power of his office and obstructing Congress, and his ultimate acquittal by the Senate. To date, there has been no evidence produced of any wrongdoing by the Bidens.Multiple sources:  * * In October 2019, CNN refused to run an ad for the Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign, saying it includes false claims against Biden. Fox News refused to stop airing a Trump campaign ad that allegedly lies about Biden even after Biden's campaign asked them to stop. On October 14, 2020, the tabloid journal New York Post ran a story showing a screenshot of an email purporting to be from a top advisor to Ukrainian company Burisma to Joe Biden's son Hunter, thanking him for the supposed opportunity to meet his father. The article alleges that this supports claims that Biden used his political power to benefit his son Hunter in business dealings with Ukraine. The Post's source was Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who says he got the data from the hard drive of a laptop allegedly dropped off at a repair shop in April 2019. The shop owner, John MacIsaac, said he initially turned the laptop over to the FBI and later shared a copy of the data with Giuliani. CBS reported that they held a lengthy interview with MacIsaac in which he frequently contradicted himself, \\"raising questions about [his] truthfulness.\\" Social media platforms swiftly responded by controlling how the article could be shared‚ÄîFacebook by including a fact-checking statement and Twitter by preventing links to the story on the basis of its containing hacked material. Republican politicians accused these platforms of censorship and renewed calls for reform of Section 230 and Trump suggested that the disclosures should disqualify Biden from the presidency. Biden's campaign and those associated with him portrayed the article's allegations as false, saying that no such meeting ever happened. The FBI had earlier warned Trump that Giuliani was being used by Russian intelligence as part of an influence campaign.

The history of the Lake County Library System began in 1975 when the Lake County Library Planning Advisory Board was created to make a recommendation to the Board of County Commissioners for a county wide library system. Mr. Cecil Beach, consultant, was retained to perform a feasibility study and make recommendations based on information obtained. Beach advised the Advisory Board to adopt the Inter-local Agreement Format for the county‚Äôs library organization. The Advisory Board concurred with his recommendation and reported that to the board of County Commissioners. On September 29, 1982 the Lake County Board of County Commissioners authorized the signature of the county ordinance that established the county-wide library system. Charter members of the Lake County Library system were Cooper Memorial Library in Clermont, Eustis Memorial Library and the Umatilla Public Library. By 1997, the Mount Dora Public Library which is now the W.T. Bland Public Library as well as the Fruitland Park Library and the Lady Lake Library had joined the Lake County Library System. However the Eustis Memorial Library withdrew from the Lake County Library System. Today the Lake County Library System is governed by the Lake County Board of County Commissioners.

Socialist Party of Ireland Until 1904, Connolly was the leading figure in the Irish Socialist Republican Party (ISRP). However, the ISRP had lost many members following internal disputes, with some forming the rival Irish Socialist Labour Party (ISLP). The ISLP attempted to affiliate to the recently founded British Socialist Labour Party, but was advised to attempt to merge with the ISRP first. With Connolly out of the country, this was achieved, the two groups coming together to form the new \\"Socialist Party of Ireland\\".Donal Nevin, James Connolly: A Full Life Although the party's initial membership was based in Dublin, it soon established groups in Belfast and Cork. However, it was unable to attract the Belfast-based members of the Independent Labour Party (ILP) around William Walker to join, as they opposed the new party's principle of Irish Home Rule.Peter Barberis et al, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations, p.207-208, 251 Despite some growth, the party remained small and only held its first conference in 1910. Connolly was chosen as its national organiser, while Francis Sheehy-Skeffington became president, Michael Mallin was secretary, and William X. O'Brien was also elected to the executive. In 1912, Connolly called a socialist unity conference in Dublin, attended by the Belfast branch of the Socialist Party and four of the Belfast-based ILP branches, only Walker's own branch refusing to attend. The five groups united to form the \\"Independent Labour Party of Ireland\\", but this collapsed soon after the outbreak of World War I, after Connolly was banned from giving speeches alleged to be pro-German in Belfast by the local leadership of the group.Peter Collins, \\"The Labour Movement in Belfast\\", ed. J√ºrgen Elvert, Nordirland in Geschichte und Gegenwart, pp.83‚Äì84 Nationally, the SPI almost stopped operating during the war, but was revived by supporters of the Russian February Revolution and October Revolution. With the SPI now led by O'Brien, Cathal O'Shannon was elected as president,Matt Treacy, The Communist Party of Ireland 1921 ‚Äì 2011, pp.4‚Äì14 and Sean O'Casey also became a leading figure. An opposition faction around Roddy Connolly and Se√°n McLoughlin wished to affiliate to the Communist International (Comintern).Charlie McGuire, \\"Se√°n McLoughlin ‚Äì the boy commandant of 1916\\", History Ireland, Vol.14, No.2 But even O'Shannon spoke about pursuing both political and military action to enable a workers' revolution, and welcomed the formation of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). To build links with the Bolsheviks, both factions in the SPI claimed that the party had played a significant role in the Irish War of Independence. Although some members had been centrally involved, this claim was not correct, as the party was largely inactive at the time. Communist Party of Ireland The left faction were successful in winning the group over, with Connolly becoming the leader and McLoughlin elected as president. Liam O'Flaherty and George Pollock also came to prominence, while O'Brien and O'Shannon were expelled in October, at the same time as the group renamed itself as the Communist Party of Ireland (CPI).Michael Gallagher, Political Parties in the Republic of Ireland, p.97 Connolly wrote a document setting out a strategy for the party, arguing that it should develop a nucleus in the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the Irish Citizen Army, while also seeing revolutionary potential in the Protestant workers in Ulster. However, the Comintern ordered the party to focus on the national question and orientate to the IRA. While the CPGB was supportive of the CPI, it disagreed on this focus. Although the party claimed 300 members in October 1921, this dropped rapidly, and by the end of November, it claimed only 78 members in Dublin and 28 in Cork. In December, Nora Connolly and Eamonn MacAlpine were suspended and formed the rival Communist Groups, focusing more heavily on links with the IRA. The CPGB sent Thomas A. Jackson and Willie Gallacher to arrange negotiations between the two. The Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed in December 1921, and the CPI sided with the anti-treaty republicans; Peadar O'Donnell, a leading figure in the IRA, joined the party, and it formed a small Red Guard which offered to provide support for the IRA. O'Flaherty and Se√°n McIntyre led a small group of CPI members who declared that they were establishing a Soviet Republic while they occupied the Rotunda Hospital in January 1922, but the party's leadership called this a \\"childish stunt\\", and both leaders left Dublin and the party. The British Special Branch concluded that Connolly had visited Moscow on more than one occasion, and that the party was receiving a subsidy from the Comintern. They incorrectly believed that the party was responsible for numerous revolutionary actions early in 1922.Paul McMahon, British Spies and Irish Rebels: British Intelligence and Ireland, 1916‚Äì1945, p.123 At the 1922 Irish general election, the CPI endorsed O'Donnell's successful candidature in Donegal, although he did not sit as a party member. Patrick Gaffney, who had been elected for the Labour Party in the election, left it soon afterwards and joined the CPI, becoming its only Parliamentary representative. He stood again in the 1923 general election, but was heavily defeated. The CPI held its first Congress in January 1923, chaired by Walter Carpenter. Other than Gaffney, all the delegates were from Dublin. With membership remaining low, when Jim Larkin established the Irish Worker League in September, the Comintern ordered the CPI to dissolve itself, and for its members to work through Larkin's group. Although the party's leadership protested that membership would rise once imprisoned members were released, they complied with the order.

He received a very enthusiastic letter of approval providing the film was limited to non-commercial exhibition (because of commercial licensing commitments Marvel Comics had at the time). Next, he presented the idea to his experimental film class, proposing a half hour, 16mm, color, sound, semi- professional Spider-Man movie. When he outlined the special effects the class felt that it was impossible, but his instructor, Peter Glushanok, was very interested and gave Cardozo the go-ahead. The first term was spent almost entirely in pre-production. Cardozo was a perfectionist, and spoke with hundreds of people before deciding on the cast alone. He wanted the audience to say to themselves, \\"he or she looks and acts exactly like the characters.\\" Daphne Stevens and Marilyn Hecht made the costumes, Richard Eberhardt designed the graphics, such as the Spider-signal, (as well as playing Spider-Man in costume) and Art Schweitzer created the unusual lighting effects featured throughout the film. Cardozo worked on the scenario, production direction and the special effects. They built an entire section of building for Spider-Man to climb. They used traveling matte shots to make Spider-Man swing through Times Square at night with all the neon signs flashing in the background to produce breath-taking and dazzling visuals. Rather than using a phony looking backdrop when Spider-Man climbs up and down buildings, they matted in colorful sunsets and backgrounds, and utilized travelling mattes in a scene where Kraven sends lions after Spider-Man in the final conflict. The second term was hectic with more shooting and editing by Julie Tanser. When the film was bout 3/4 finished, they gave Stan Lee, Ray Thomas and other members of the bullpen, a preview of some of the key scenes of the film. They were very impressed and enthusiastic about the results and encouraged them to finish the project. Cardozo and his crew had hoped to have the film distributed in some form in the future, but in June 2015, he died. Its last known showing was at the Comic Book and Science Fiction Convention in Los Angeles in 2005. As of 2012 the film was not available online because Cardozo was against it. Plot The screenplay was adapted primarily from The Amazing Spider-Man #15, with various scenes added to update the story concerning Kraven's first arrival in America. Spider-Man swings down and catches a group organizing a bank robbery and upon dropping in unexpectedly, a man escapes and contacts Kraven the Hunter. Parker finds this out firsthand when taking photographs for The Daily Bugle when Kraven arrives by boat. After studying Spider-Man's fighting style by organizing a robbery for Spider-Man to stop, Kraven finally comes out of hiding and fights Spider-Man. Spider-Man realizes the true strength of Kraven and also realizes that Kraven cheats by infecting his opposition with drugs that weaken them. Cast * Joe Ellison as Peter Parker / Spider-Man * A.

Sometimes referred to as the \\"mopping up\\" operations many rebels surrendered themselves and their arms, while others were captured and punished. It also included the hunt for the Jacobite leader Bonnie Prince Charles Edward Stuart otherwise known as the Young Pretender. Most of the work was done on behalf of the Government by the Independent Highland Companies of militia and also the Campbell of Argyll Militia. Background The Jacobite rising of 1745 had ultimately been defeated at the Battle of Culloden that took place on 16 April 1746, not far from Inverness.Pollard. p. 37. On 7 May, Lord Loudoun (John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun), supporter of the British- Hanoverian Government, left Inverness and ordered the independent companies to march to Fort Augustus.MacLeod. p. 342. They arrived there from Urquhart and Beauly on 8 May. On 14 May, George Munro, 1st of Culcairn's company reached Fort Augustus and by this time there were rumours that the Jacobite leader, known as the Young Pretender (Charles Edward Stuart) had got off a French ship and had been on the isles of Harris and Lewis. On 16 May, Lord Loudoun made a return of the independent companies at Fort Augustus which totaled 1,526 men. On the same day General Bland arrived at Fort Augustus with three battalions of Kingston's Horse.MacLeod. p. 343. On 19 May, Major-general John Campbell wrote from Fort William that the rebel Jacobite Coll MacDonell of Barisdale had gone to Loch Arkaig with 120 men and that the Glengarry folk were to join him, that there were new arms and Lochgarry, the Macphersons and Frasers were also expected. Lord Loudoun with the seventeen independent companies marched five miles from Fort Augustus to Aberchalder to make room for Prince William, Duke of Cumberland who was expected with the army. On 20 May, Lieutenant- colonel Jack Campbell of Loudon's Highlanders Regiment, commanding 250 men of the Campbell of Argyll Militia arrived at Fort Augustus on his way to join his father at Fort William. On 21 May, a man named Murdoch Macrae from Kintail was captured by one of the MacDonald independent companies whilst in Glen Garry. Macrae gave information on the rebels gathering at Achnacarry, but Lord Loudoun considered him a spy and sent him to the Duke of Cumberland who was then still at Inverness. Macrae arrived at Inverness at 8am and was hanged before 10am. General Bland then decided that Lord Loudoun should make a raid into Lochaber. Raid on Lochaber On 22 May, 1746, Lord Loudoun with 300 regular troops, 250 men of the Campbell of Argyll Militia and eight Independent Highland Companies of the MacDonalds, Mackenzies, Rosses, Grants and Mackays marched down the Great Glen.MacLeod. pp. 343‚Äì344. George Munro of Culcairn with another 300 regulars and eight Independent Highland Companies of the Munros, MacLeods, Geanies' and Sutherlands marched by way of Glen Garry to meet up with the other force at Loch Arkaig.MacLeod. p. 344. The town of Inverness independent company was left at Aberchalder. On 24 May, Lord Loudoun almost captured the rebel Jacobite Donald Cameron of Lochiel who was forced to disperse his men and flee to Rannoch. On 25 May, Lord Loudoun left Achnacarry after large numbers of Camerons had come in and surrendered their arms. Loudoun then marched to Moy, while the regular troops were ordered back to Fort Augustus. Loudoun was joined by Munro of Culcairn who had burnt Achnacarry Castle. On 27 May, Loudoun marched for Rannoch with ten independent companies of the Sutherlands, Mackays, MacDonalds and MacLeods. Meanwhile, six other companies were left at Moy with Munro of Culcairn. In order to \\"root out\\" the remainder of the rebels who were still in arms, the Duke of Cumberland ordered Lord George Sackville to march to Knoydart and Lieutenant- colonel Cornwallis to march to Loch Arkaig. On 30 May, the Duke of Cumberland had reached Fort William and Lord Loudoun returned from Rannoch to meet him, and some days later Loudoun returned to Laggan, Badenoch. Raid on Shiramore Major-general Campbell On 1 June, 1746, the two Sutherland independent companies and one of the MacLeod independent companies had reached Shiramore.MacLeod. p. 345. By 2 June, the remaining MacLeod companies and the three MacDonald companies had also arrived and on 3 June the two Mackay companies had arrived. All of these companies made returns of their soldiers. Meanwhile, at Moy, Munro of Culcairn wrote that 107 rebels had come in and surrendered their arms. On 10 June, Aeneas MacDonnell, brother of Kinlochmoidart, who had already been captured, finally admitted to Major- general Campbell that the Young Pretender had sailed to South Uist. On 11 June, Munro of Culcairn marched with his seven companies from Moy to Linachan and at Inverness Lord Loudoun made a return of more than 2000 firelocks collected in five weeks. On 13 June the rebel Jacobite Coll MacDonell of Barisdale submitted at Glenelg and two days later he met Lord Loudoun and Sir Alexander MacDonald having been offered terms in exchange for information about the Young Pretender. Hunt for the Young Pretender On 16 June, Lord Loudoun having received information about the Young Pretender ordered six independent companies to Skye, these were the three MacLeod and three MacDonald companies who were under the command of MacLeod of Talisker.MacLeod. p. 346. Three of the companies were to be transported to South Uist. On 21 June MacLeod of Talisker crossed over to Skye and marched to Loch Bracadale where Bernera's, Aird's and Kirkibost's companies were to embark for South Uist. However, they were prevented from doing so by bad storms. On 29 June the storms having stopped the three companies sailed to South Uist, arriving the next day. On 30 June William Tolmie at Dunvegan Castle wrote to the Laird of MacLeod that the latest information was that \\"the Young Gentleman went from South Uist upon Tuesday (24 June) for the mainland in an eight oared boat and upon Wednesday was endeavouring in to Ruindunan. But a crowed of people from the land frightened them from landing in there place, so went off but God knows where\\". Charles Edward Stuart known as the Young Pretender On 27 June, Munro of Culcairn now at Shiramore had been ordered to Caithness with his own company, the Rosses and Geanies'. He reached Thurso on 7 July. On the same day Talisker was at a place called Unish having gone there on information that the Young Pretender was there.MacLeod. p. 347. On 8 July, Talisker hurried over to Mugstot in Trotternish having heard news that the Young Pretender had landed there on 29 June disguised in women's clothes. On 10 July, General Campbell reached Skye from Barra having received information that the Young Pretender had left Portree along with the Laird of Mackinnon. That day the old Laird of Mackinnon was captured in Morar and he confirmed that the Young Pretender had left Skye on 4 July. On 13 July, the Duke of Cumberland at Fort Augustus ordered that a chain was to be formed from Loch Eil to Loch Hourn in order to seal off Morar and Arisaig. Alexander Gunn and George Mackay's independent companies were ordered into the chain. Lord Loudoun then ordered Munro of Culcairn with his three companies to march for Gairloch to guard the coast against the landing of the Young Pretender. On 18 July, the Duke of Cumberland left Fort Augustus and was greeted in triumph a few days later in London. That day Munro of Culcain and his three companies left Thurso. On 21 July, the Young Pretender slipped through the cordon at Glencosie. On 24 July, the cordon was withdrawn and Alexander Gunn's company returned to Shiramore, but George Mackay's company was ordered to Loch Broom.MacLeod. pp. 347‚Äì348. Munro of Culcairn reached Loch Broom on the same day having marched 120 miles in seven days. However, Lord Albemarle who was now in charge at Fort Augustus ordered Culcairn back to Thurso.MacLeod. p. 348. Alexander MacDonald of Kingsburgh who had been brought in as a prisoner and whose house The Young Pretender had stayed in was sent off to Edinburgh on 29 July. Culcairn prepared to march back to Thurso on 30 July, but on 1 August, whilst at Foulis Castle, he received orders from Lord Loudoun to go back to Loch Broom. He set off to Loch Broom the next day having marched 92 miles in five days. He sent detachments to Rhu Stoer and Loch Ewe, and was joined by George Mackay's company. MacDonald of Barrisdale made arrangements to meet Captain John Sutherland of Forse, but he claimed that he had waited at the rendezvous point but no one had turned up. Lord Albemarle who thoroughly disliked the Highlands left Fort Augustus on 13 August for Edinburgh. On 19 August, Lord Loudoun ordered Munro of Culcairn to sweep through Knoydart with his four companies and into Lochaber and he reached Fort Augustus on 23 August. Captain Alexander Grant of Knockando sent out a detachment that nearly caught the Young Pretender at Torvuilt. Murder of Munro of Culcairn On 31 August, Munro of Culcairn's four companies joined up with Captain Grant's detachment.MacLeod. p. 349. However, during a march along Loch Arkaig Culcairn was shot dead by someone in the woods. Parties were sent to search for the assassin but found nothing. The Rev. John Cameron maintained that Culcairn was shot by mistake for Captain Grant, in revenge, by the father of a man killed on the orders of Grant. Lord Albermarle reported that the murderer of Culcairn was John Roy McFie who was frequently called John Roy Cameron and who lived at Auchinsoul on North Arkaigside.

Escape of the Young Pretender Between late August and late September 1746 the independent companies were gradually reduced and disbanded.MacLeod. pp. 350‚Äì351. In the early hours of 20 September, the Young Pretender sailed from Loch nan Uamh having only had the under strength companies of Lord Loudoun's Regiment to contend with.

Published in Cora Lenore Williams' book The Fourth-Dimensional Reaches of the Exposition, 1915. Gertrude Partington Albright (Sept. 11, 1874- Sept. 7, 1959) was a British-born American artist known for portrait etchings and her Cubism- influenced California landscapes. She taught at the California School of Fine Arts for nearly thirty years. Family and education She was born Gertrude Partington in Heysham, a coastal village in England. Her father was John Herbert Evelyn Partington (1843‚Äì99), a painter, and her mother was Sarah (Mottershead) Partington. Four of her six siblings also had careers in the arts, notably Blanche, who became a writer; Phyllis, who became an opera singer under the stage name Frances Peralta; John, who became a theater manager; and Richard, who became an artist. Her family emigrated to the United States in 1889, settling in Oakland, California. In 1917, she married Herman Oliver Albright (born Herman Oliver Albrecht in Germany; 1876-1944), also a landscape painter. She died in San Francisco. Her papers are held by the Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley. Art education and career She got her early training in art from her father and was only 16 when she sold her first artwork. For a time she worked as an illustrator for the San Francisco Examiner, contributing courtroom sketches and society portraits. She eventually earned enough money as an illustrator to afford a trip to Europe for further art training, enrolling at the Acad√©mie Del√©cluse in the late 1890s. By 1903, she was exhibiting at the Paris Salon. Albright stayed abroad for several years, making occasional return trips to California. When she returned to the Bay Area for good in 1912, she opened a painting and printmaking studio on Post Street. An established artist by then, she joined the faculty at the California School of Fine Arts in 1917, teaching painting and etching. She was promoted to associate professor in 1932 and remained at the school until she retired in 1946. Her students there included Victor Arnautoff. She also sat on the school's board of directors. Albright was often commissioned to make portraits, and her portrait etchings drew praise for their skillful likenesses and clear, minimal lines. She is also known for her Cubism-inflected Post-Impressionist landscapes done in oil on wood. Critics noted the strong influence of Paul C√©zanne on her paintings but considered that her work succeeded on its own merits. She exhibited widely, winning a bronze medal for one of her portraits at the 1915 Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition. Her work is in the collections of museums including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Oakland Museum, and the De Young Museum. She was active in Bay Area art organizations, becoming a charter member of the California Society of Etchers and the director of the San Francisco Society of Women Artists and serving on many prize juries.

He spent his early career with Carl O. Sauer at the University of California at Berkeley, where he was an Associate Professor from 1926 to 1930.  Life  Schmieder studied geography at the University of Bonn, University of K√∂nigsberg, and the University of Heidelberg. His dissertation on the Sierra de Gredos was supervised by Alfred Hettner. Although focusing on physical geography, the final conclusions of his dissertation already include a certain notion of the social and cultural-historical forces that are decisive for the genesis of the landscape (later known as the cultural-genetic method); a point of view influenced by Hettner. In 1914 he undertook his first private field trip to Peru, but cancelled his trip in Chile to participate in the First World War.B√§hr, J., Stewig, R. (1981): Beitr√§ge zur Theorie und Methode der L√§nderkunde: Oskar Schmieder zum Gedenken. Universit√§t Kiel. His first travel to Latin America was crucial for his later career. After his Habilitation under Alfred Philippson in Bonn in 1919, with a study on the settlement geography of √Åvila in central Spain, he travelled again to Latin America. Before arriving in Peru and Chile, however, he became a professor of mineralogy and geology at the Universidad Nacional de C√≥rdoba, Argentina, where he remained from 1920 to 1925. Influenced by his mentor Alfred Hettner, who worked on the Colombian Andes, his regional focus was appreciated at the University of California at Berkeley where he worked with Carl O. Sauer as a Visiting Professor (1925) and Associate Professor (until 1930) (replacing Richard Russel),Kenzer, M. (1987): Carl O. Sauer, a tribute.

After Schmieder's departure, Sauer himself began to offer seminars on Latin America,Delpar, H. (2008): Looking South: The Evolution of Latin Americanist Scholarship in the United States, 1850-1975. University of Alabama Press. yet followed more or less the L√§nderkunde format of Schmieder, as James J. Parsons lines out: Back to Germany in 1930, he became a professor of geography at the University of Kiel, where he continued his work on Latin America with his disciple and assistant Herbert Wilhelmy. He soon adopted the then dominating nationalist/national socialist mode of thinking, became an admirer of the colonial policies of Fascist Italy, contributed to national socialist Lebensraum research, and became a member of the NSDAP in 1941. After a period at the University of Halle, he went back to Kiel. In the 1950s, he was a Visiting Professor at the University of Karachi and the University of Chile. In a 1967 volume of the Pakistan Geographical Review he was described as \\"one of the very senior geographers, a chapter in German geography, an image of Hettner, and a successful writer. He is one of the associates of Berkeley school of geography, founded by Carl Sauer\\". Schmieder was a convinced representative of L√§nderkunde regional geography.

She was known for her close relationship to her brother the Duke of Choiseaul and credited with an influential position at court during his tenure as minister in 1758‚Äì1770. She is also known for her attempt to become the official mistress of Louis XV in the 1760s, and her succeeding feud with Madame du Barry.  Biography  =Early life= B√©atrix was the daughter of Franz Joseph Marquis de Choiseul, Marquis of Stainville, and Marie-Louise Bassompierre, and sister of √âtienne Fran√ßois, duc de Choiseul. Unmarried, she was initially made canoness of Remiremont. When her brother was appointed minister, however, she was able to join him in Paris, and her negotiations were made to arrange a marriage for her, so that she would be able to attend court. In 1759, she married Antoine VII, Duke of Gramont, governor of Navarre, after negotiations to marry her to Louis de Bauffremont failed. She separated from her spouse three months after the wedding, and lived thereafter in the household of her brother, over whom she was credited some influence in several affairs.Williams, Hugh Noel, Madame Dubarry, Beijer, Stockholm, 1905 While her sister-in-law was described as a timid character who followed her lead, her close relationship to her brother was well known. Due to the position of her brother, she regularly attended court, became a significant figure in court life and a personal friend of Madame de Pompadour.Williams, Hugh Noel, Madame Dubarry, Beijer, Stockholm, 1905 She was described as proud, overbearing, and spiteful but also intelligent, witty and attractive, despite not being conventionally beautiful. =Ambitions= Upon the death of Madame de Pompadour in 1764, Gramont had the ambition to succeed her as the official mistress of Louis XV. She shared this ambition with another friend of Pompadour, the Madame d'Esparbes, and their rivalry attracted attention at court. Gramont's ambition was encouraged by her brother, but reportedly, she attempted to seduce the king in such a direct manner that he became alarmed and avoided her by accepting the advances of her rival instead.Williams, Hugh Noel, Madame Dubarry, Beijer, Stockholm, 1905 According to court gossip, Madame d'Esparbes was on the point of being declared official mistress at Marly when Choiseul caused a scene to prevent it. Meeting her one-day on the grand staircase, he took her by the chin and exclaimed: \\"Well, little one, how are your affairs progressing?\\", which caused a scandal at court and made Louis XV to discontinue the affair.Williams, Hugh Noel, Madame Dubarry, Beijer, Stockholm, 1905 =The Choiseul party and Madame de Barry= Gramont continued her attempts to succeed as official royal mistress, and reportedly believed herself to be near success when Madame du Barry attained the position in 1768. The duchess de Gramont, in collaboration with her sister-in-law the duchesse de Choiseul and the princesse de Beauvau, (referred to as \\"the Choiseul- women\\") lead the noblewomen first in their efforts to prevent Madame du Barry from being presented at court, and then to ostracize her from it.Williams, Hugh Noel, Madame Dubarry, Beijer, Stockholm, 1905 One idea, suggested by the Mesdames de France was for the king to marry to either the Marie Th√©r√®se Louise of Savoy, Princesse de Lamballe or Archduchess Maria Elisabeth of Austria (1743‚Äì1808), but the Choiseul party opposed a remarriage of the king, and according to Florimond Claude, Comte de Mercy-Argenteau: :\\"Persons in power, imagine that a queen, judicious and amiable, who would succeed in gaining the affection of her husband, might open his eyes to the irregularities and the enormous abuses which exist in all departments here, and cause much embarrassment to those who direct them. They are consequently of opinion that it behoves them to divert the mind of the King from ideas of marriage; and I have very strong proofs that Madame de Gramont, more interested than any one in the mamtenance of the present abuses, has succeeded in persuading M. de Choiseul to renounce his own predilections in this affair.\\"Williams, Hugh Noel, Madame Dubarry, Beijer, Stockholm, 1905 After the formal introduction of Madame du Barry to court, Gramont, duchesse de Choiseul and the princesse de Beauvau excused themselves from the king's private suppers of the Petits Cabinets, effectively demonstrating that it was socially unacceptable for noblewomen to associate with Madame du Barry. The king defeated the boycott by Gramont by enlisting initially the Marechale de Mirepoix (friend of Madame de Pompadour) and then several other noblewomen to integrate his mistress at court by acting as her companions.Joan Haslip (1991). Madame du Barry. The wages of beauty. London: George Wedienfeld and Nicolson Limited. When Madame de Barry was officially accepted at court, the conflict developed into a personal feud between the king's mistress and the Choiseul party. The Duke de Lauzun was sent to mediate a message of peace from Madame du Barry to the Duke de Choiseul, but when he arrived, Choiseul was in the company of his sister and received the message \\"with all the haughtiness of a Minister who is harassed by women and believes that he has nothing to fear,\\" and declared that there was \\"war to the knife\\" between him and Madame du Barry, while Gramont \\"made some outrageous remarks, in which she did not spare even the King.\\"Williams, Hugh Noel, Madame Dubarry, Beijer, Stockholm, 1905 The Comtesse de Gramont, lady-in-waiting to Marie Antoinette and the sister-in-law of the Duchess the Gramont, participated in the continuing boycot and made a rude remark to Madame du Barry, causing the king to exile her from court, creating discord between Madame de Barry and Marie Antoinette.Williams, Hugh Noel, Madame Dubarry, Beijer, Stockholm, 1905 During the affair regarding the Duc d'Aiguillon, she was accused of participating in a conspiracy organised by Choiseul. Mercy reported to empress Maria Theresa that:\\"the Duc de Choiseul had had a violent altercation with the Duc de Richelieu, owing to the latter having declared that the Duchesse de Gramont, while passing through Provence and Languedoc, on her way to the waters of Bareges, had sought to stir up the Parliaments of those provinces against the decisions of the Court in the affair of the Duc d'Aiguillon.\\"Williams, Hugh Noel, Madame Dubarry, Beijer, Stockholm, 1905 The conflict between Madame du Barry and the Duke de Choiseul ultimately resulted in the dismissal and exile of Choiseul from court, for which Madame du Barry on at least one occasion blamed Gramont: :\\"The conversation after dinner took a more serious turn. She spoke with a charming frankness about the Due de Choiseul, and expressed regret for not having been on friendly terms with him ; she told us of all the trouble she had taken to bring about a better understanding, and said that, had it not been for his sister, the Duchesse de Gramont, she would have succeeded in the end ; she did not complain of any one and said nothing spiteful.\\"Williams, Hugh Noel, Madame Dubarry, Beijer, Stockholm, 1905 =Later life and death= B√©atrix de Choiseul-Stainville left court life when her brother was exiled and joined him and his wife in their life at Chanteloup. She became known as a distinguished bibliophile, and hosted a noted literary salon. During the Reign of Terror, she was arrested and accused of providing funds for the royalist emigrees. Questioned before the Revolutionary Tribunal, which was to condemn her to the guillotine, she was asked: \\"Did you not send money to emigrants?\\", she replied: \\"I was going to say no, but my life is not worth a lie!\\"  References   Sources  * Louis Petit de Bachaumont, Anecdotes piquantes, Paris, Gay et Douc√©, 1881, p. 285\\\\. * Armand Louis de Gontaut-Biron, M√©moires du duc de Lauzun (1747‚Äì1783), Paris, Poulet-Malassis et de Broise, 1858, p. 8\\\\.

Personal life Sadie Kuttner was born in Cincinnati in 1883, the daughter of Simon H. Kuttner (1853-1940) and Pauline Grunauer (1850-1913). She moved to St. Louis in 1900, at which time she entered the Beethoven Conservatory, where she took a course of music under A. I. Epstein, who later became her husband. She early showed musical talent, taking up the study of the piano as a child. She was gifted by nature with a splendid voice, and could not remember a time when she did not sing. Career Sadie Kuttner Epstein had a crystal clear soprano voice with a fullness of tone, richness of color, and emotional expression that invariably captures her audiences. Hers might be an international reputation did she not choose a domestic life in preference to an acceptance of the many flattering offers made by Eastern managers. The warmth and grace of her temperament, added to the skilled cultivation of her musicianship, placed her in the foremost rank of singers. Since her appearance on the concert stage Epstein sang with the most prominent singing societies in St. Louis and elsewhere, engagements taking her as far north as Winnipeg, Canada, and east as far as Pittsburgh. With many of the societies she was called to take part in oratorios. Her repertoire included the soprano roles in George Frideric Handel's Hiawatha, Giuseppe Verdi's Requiem, Franz Liszt's Elizabeth of Hungary, Max Bruch's Die Schone Helene, Robert Schumann's Paradise and the Peri, and many others. Epstein had the linguistic ability to interpret her song in three languages. Incessant study, determination and ambition placed her in the high position which she occupied. There were few concert singers before the public in the 1910s who could render such long and varied lists of song as Epstein. From the point of view of vocalization alone her success was great, and as to interpretation her range of intelligence and feeling was inexhaustive. Epstein had very flattering offers from Eastern concert leaders, but she realized that she could not be the happy wife and mother that she was and lead a life such as would be required of a member of an opera troupe at the same time. Without any hesitation or regret she refused offer after offer. Her work with the St. Louis Symphony Society was a great triumph. For the first time in many years a singer from this city was chosen to appear as soloist at the regular concerts. During the Louisiana Purchase Exposition she was engaged by the Scranton Oratorio Society of Scranton, Pennsylvania, to sing the soprano role in Felix Mendelssohn's Oratorio, Elijah, at the concert given by them in Festival Hall in 1904. Epstein was the only St. Louis singer engaged for the concerts given during the fair, most of them coming from Chicago and New York. The soprano role in Elijah was a difficult one, which she rendered amazingly well. Many unique programmes were rendered by Epstein in connection with Mrs. C. B. Rohland's lecture recitals, and unquestionably some of the most difficult and interesting works of the old and modern composers were presented by these two artists. Compositions by Jean Sibelius, Johann Strauss I, Claude Debussy, Wolff, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Mily Balakirev, Anton Rubinstein, Alexander Borodin, Mikhail Glinka, Bachmetieff, Modest Mussorgsky, Alexander Dargomyzhsky, were presented to the public, and beauties of these works brought out in masterly style. Epstein was the first singer in America to give an entire recital of the works of Sibelius, the great Finnish composer. The two women prepared a pretentious programme of modern Italian music given in various cities during the season of 1913‚Äì14. Rohland was a recognized authority on musical data and was closely identified with the development of music in St. Louis. Her lectures were excellently prepared, instructive, and her sympathetic artistic accompaniments on the piano a great help to the singer. She was the director of the new Choral Society which was organized in St. Louis for singers only, the object of the club being to do strictly choral work. Rohland was a resident of Alton, Illinois, but made weekly visits to St. Louis for the purpose of directing musical societies. The Alton public had brought before them many of the leading orchestras, soloists and best musical talent of all countries through the influence of Rohland. Personal life and family Abraham I. Epstein (1858-1929) Sadie Kuttner Epstein was the wife of Abraham I. Epstein (1858-1929), of the Beethoven Conservatory, with whom, from 1879 to 1924, as organist and choirmaster of St. John's Methodist Church and the Temple Shaari Emeth, she sang many years. Epstein, in addition to conservatory work, directed these two church choirs for more than twenty years, both of which were known for their remarkable aggregation of good singers. Two of the representative musicians of St. Louis are Marcus I. Epstein (1855-1947) and Abraham I. Epstein, who gained a national reputation as players of duets on the piano. The Epsteins were an exceptionally talented family. Herman Epstein was equally distinguished as a pianist. They were all Native Americans ‚Äî born in Mobile, Alabama, the sons of Rabbi Isaac Epstein. Abraham Epstein studied with Eug√®ne Pr√©vost and other masters, devoting himself mainly to teaching piano, organ and composition lessons.

G. [www.erbzine.com/mag17/Lin_Carter.doc \\"Lin Carter: a Look Behind the Martian Stories.\\"] in ERBzine. It was first published in paperback by DAW Books in June 1984 and reissued in hardcover and trade paperback by Wildside Press in February 2008. The title of the book is taken from a line of the poem Kubla Khan by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. David Graham wrote a post-apocalyptic novel with the same title (), also derived from the same Coleridge poem. Plot summary Mars, a world with a culture ages older than that of Earth, is a dying world, and has been in decline for eons. By the twenty-second century it has become a colony of the younger civilization of Earth, its natives oppressed by the rapacious Colonial Authority. In a ruined city, Terran outlaw and prospector Jim Brant discovers two native women who have been staked out and left to die for the offense of loving each other. He frees the couple, named Zuarra and Suoli. Their affection has not survived the experience, as Suoli betrayed cowardice when left to their fate, in contrast to the stoic Zuarra. The ill-sorted trio soon encounters other wanderers in the waste, Terran archeologist Will Harbin and his native guide Agila, a strong figure to whom the dependent Suoli soon attaches herself. This brings new complications, as Agila is a fugitive from the bandit chief Tuan, from whom he stole an ancient disc engraved with a treasure map. The combined party follows the map to a cave containing a stairwell descending into unknown depths. Exploring to see where it leads, they discover a huge cavern containing an underground sea. They have been trailed, however, by Tuan's bandits, who capture them and propose to burn Agila alive. The operation is interrupted by children riding giant dragonflies, which carry everyone away to their base, the floating raft-city of Zhar. The Zharians are a nation of innocents, primitive but possessed of strong psychic powers. Agila and Suoli, taking advantage of their hosts' seeming weakness, attempt to rob the sea people's prince Azuri, whom they end up killing. Shocked and offended, the remaining Zharians demonstrate their power by psychically suffocating the two and compelling the rest of the outsiders to reconcile and return to the surface. Back in the Martian wastes, Brant's party and Tuan's bandits all part ways. Brant and Zuarra, now an item, intend to wed. Chronology This story was the fifth published in the series, after The City Outside the World, but in terms of events it comes fourth, between The City Outside the World and The Man Who Loved Mars. Reception Den Valdron, assessing the series in ERBzine, rates the book as the least interesting of the series, \\"but each has their [sic] particular strengths.\\" Over all, he feels \\"[t]here‚Äôs something a little extra in his Martian novels that puts them at the upper registers of Carter‚Äôs work,\\" and \\"commend[s] them to the reader.\\" J. G. Huckenpohler, also writing in ERBzine, rated the series \\"among my favorites\\" of Carter's stories, \\"show[ing] more originality\\" than Carter's Zanthodon and Callisto books. Nonetheless, he \\"found them to be uneven,\\" growing \\"increasingly repetitious, the last two [including \\"Sea\\"] especially.\\" He considers it \\"the weakest and most derivative of the four [novels], drawing plot elements from Verne, Burroughs, and Brackett, among others,\\" but credits it \\"for blending them in an imaginative way.\\" It shares what he identifies as the sequence's standard plot: \\"[a] Terran outlaw, an older Dok-i-tar, a Martian sidekick, originally an enemy, and a Martian girl find a lost city known only to the oldest legends of the Martians, unlock its secrets, and either remain as its rulers or escape to begin a new life.\\" The novel was also reviewed by Don D'Ammassa in Science Fiction Chronicle no. 60, September 1984, and William M.

It was recorded in the United States, produced by Sylvia Massy and financed via a crowdfunding campaign. It is their last album with bassist Edu Filgueira, who left the band in January 2018. The band sees the album as a more unpretentious and free work than its predecessor, modeHuman, and believes it to be more representative of what they really are. They wanted to create songs that were easier to sing along in shows and that could be easily played with an acoustic guitar in a circle of friends, for example. In studio, the members, encouraged by Masy, experimented with a couple of different things, like playing synths with the cables going through electricity-conducting food. Like modeHuman, Unlikely was well received by the critics.  Background  Searching for a producer for their sophomore album, the band came upon experienced Sylvia Massy (Red Hot Chili Peppers, Johnny Cash, Tool, Foo Fighters, Bj√∂rk, Prince and System of a Down) through a common friend she had with the band's manager, Thiago Endrigo. When asked about the importance of having a female producer, keyboardist and vocalist Cris Botarelli said: Still in January, they traveled to the United States to record the album, more precisely to the city of Ashland in Oregon. They arrived in the country with all songs already complete, except for \\"Coruja\\", which was written there during a week in which Massy was still away. In February, they announced the album title and a crowdfunding at the Kickante website to finance it. The idea of collectively financing the album was to make fans feel like part of the album's creation process. The campaign received a total of 68,700 reais. In May, they invited some people for a listening session, but instead of simply reproducing it through speakers, they performed it live. On 6 August, only two days after the album's release, the band performed in Bras√≠lia and was surprised to see the public was already familiar with the lyrics, proving able to sing along with the band. Vocalist Emmily Barreto even tattooed the day, so much impact the experience had on her.  Songwriting, recording and concepts  Unlikely was produced and recorded in approximately 20 days in Ashland, where the band rented a house from where they could reach The Foundation Soundstage studios by foot. The band was pleased with the album because they finally achieved a sound \\"that is exactly us, both as a band and as individuals that like very different things. In relation to the previous album, I think [...] it is much less serious, less shy. When it's supposed to be heavy, it's very heavy, when it's music to sing along to, it's music to sing along to with eyes closed, you know? When it's music to dance to, it's like a nightclub, and that's it.\\" Botarelli also said, comparing the songwriting of Unlikely with the previous album's, modeHuman, that \\"this time we were more worried with writing more songs, you know? Being able to play the song on the acoustic guitar in a luau and it still be cool? We didn't have that much in the first one, it was more about big riffs, screams and go for it! It's still all that, but the melodies are cooler, I think.\\" In another interview, Botarelli said she considers that modeHuman \\"wasn't very good to sing along to because melodies were too complex. Sometimes, it was difficult to follow\\". Moreover, Barreto believes she was able to test herself further as a singer in the album, which had more room for the vocals. Still in another occasion, Botarelli explained that \\"people started to see us as a stoner rock band. This upset us, we don't sustain this leather jacket and sunglasses image. When we worked on the album, we wanted people to understand who we are\\". In another interview, she said she believed \\"we are more relaxed as a band and as people as well, everyone is more confident of what everyone does in the band and we could play with that a little more.\\" Drummer Lauro Kirsch compares both albums as follows: \\"The first album was like: 'Ok, we're getting to know each other, let's see what happens.' And then we just played it. In this second one, we wanted to do something more planned.\\" One of the characteristics of Massy that the band most enjoyed was her will to experiment with different things in studio. For example, Botarelli recorded some of her synth parts with the electricity cables of the instrument and the amplifier placed on electricity-conducting food like sausages, lemons and picles, which slightly modified the sound without compromising its operation. They did the same with a lamp and a drill. Kirsch, on the other hand, recorded some drum lines with a microphone pointed at his own penis, which, according to him, allowed them to capture a different frequency of the drum components. About the electronic elements, the keyboardist said they reflected that which was attracting her attention by the time (namely, Rihanna's Anti and Kanye West's The Life of Pablo). = Album and song titles = The name of the album refers to the improbability of a rock band from Natal having achieved international success. As Botarelli explains: As for the tracks, which are almost all named after animals, guitarist Rafael Brasil explained that since the band compose the music before writing the lyrics, each track is given a nickname. They started to play with the songs, trying to name them after animals they felt the songs looked like and those ended up being the official names. The names were originally in Portuguese, but when they realized foreigners struggled to identify the words, they translated them all to English, except for \\"Coruja\\" (\\"Owl\\"). = Song information = Comparing Unlikely's lyrics with modeHuman's, the members believe the debut album dealt with real things, while its successor covers themes they consider to be \\"nice to talk about\\" in lyrics created in an intuitive form. Bassist Eduardo Filgueira says that \\"the lyrics, just like the music, are also 'unlikely' [...] There's no total connection between them. Each of them has its own vibe. We use some embromation words to compose, then we keep completing them and it's done\\". The opening track \\"Cobra\\" was released as a single on 23 June and later received a promotional video. About choosing the song and about its video, Botarelli stated that \\"we find it pretty 'kicking the door open', like, 'we're here, remember us?'. We wanted it to be different from the others, we wanted it to feature chroma key, to be kinda rough, because the album has a vibe that is a little more unpretentious than the first one\\". The video was directed by Cl√©ver Cardoso, who directed the videos for \\"Dino vs. Dino\\" and \\"About Knives\\", from the previous album. According to him, the original intention was to shoot it somewhere in the open, but since there was no time, they worked in studio with the band playing with images projected in the background with chroma key. The track \\"Pig\\" was originally called \\"Galinha\\" (\\"Han\\") and it's supposed to suggest the environment of a farm near a beach. \\"Monkey\\" also received a video, in which all members (including Filgueira, who left the band prior to the video release in 2018) are standing beside each other in the snow with no appropriate clothing and depicted as if in a character selection-like screen. Meanwhile, Barreto, Botarelli and other artists like Carol Navarro (Supercombo) and Carol Caspary hang out in an arcade and chose the characters. Botarelli commented: \\"Rhino\\", which talks about the struggle to create the song itself, cites the verse \\"I will always love you\\", from the song of same name which was made a great hit by Whitney Houston. In the album's promotional shows, the hit is played as an intro to the show, followed by the track.  Track listing   Reception  Writing for Omelete, Jac√≠dio Junior said that \\"the structure shown in all tracks - growing and punchy sonority, heavy guitars and synthetic touches - takes the album to a big result and delivers a stimulating listening experience, which keeps the listener's attention all time\\". He pointed elements of Alanis Morissette, pop music, electronic music and Metallica's \\"That Was Just Your Life\\" in \\"Elephant\\", \\"Pig\\", \\"Pizza\\" and \\"Slug\\", respectively. He concluded his analysis saying Unlikely \\"is a clue that the group is walking a well-defined path, with characteristic sounds, conquering much with the attention to details and, mainly, understanding how to work diverse moments inside one single song and project (something few groups know and can do). Unlikely is an album that puts the band's will and punch in the foreground and balances this viscerality with technical care and attention\\". In a non-critical article for Rolling Stone Brasil, Lucas Br√™da considered that the band retained its heaviness in Unlikely \\"through incendiary riffs, filled drums and screaming vocals\\", but that the album is \\"more relaxed and, consequently, creative\\" than modeHuman, which \\"sounded serious and stern\\". For G1's Mauro Ferreira, \\"basically, Unlikely sounds like a natural consequence of modeHuman. Although it can be characterized within the generic label of heavy rock, the album features nuances throughout its 12 songs. [...] The album circles with unity around the universe of electronic hard rock\\". He concluded by saying that \\"inside the sound darkness of Unlikely, Far From Alaska finds the light which will guide the quintet on paths more and more distant from Brazil\\". Lucas Cassoli, from Monkeybuzz, said that \\"in terms of sound, we have a Far From Alaska that knew how to evince the best qualities of its arrangements and work as a team with Sylvia Massy [...] to produce the best and clearest possible sound. The tracks also stay in that middle-term between rock and pop and [...] further shorten the differences between these two genres\\". He also said the album \\"marks the rise of a Far From Alaska that is more mature and respects the traditions set by their debut album. There is a precise dose of inventiveness and a heavy investment in production, responsible for bringing out the best of each instrument\\". Cleber Facchi, in his website Miojo Indie, said the album \\"carries in the guitars and screamed voices a series of elements that communicate with various types of public\\" and that it \\"shows the attention of the quintet in the assembling of every fragment of voice, arrangement or minimum percussive notch\\". Tony Aiex, editor of the website Tenho Mais Discos que Amigos!, said \\"Unlikely continues from the point where the band's debut stopped, with big guitar riffs and well- structured songs, and inserts new layers of elements which result in one of the best albums of Brazilian rock in this and in the past 10 years\\". He praised the members' individual performances and concluded his analysis by saying that the band \\"got over the natural difficulties of a second album, took advantage from the experience it had in studio with a most competent producer and raised the level of the sonority it presented in the debut\\". It was elected the 12th best Brazilian album of 2017 by the Brazilian edition of Rolling Stone.

Brown opened his own photography studio, the Brown Show Case, on Indiana Avenue in the late 1940s. During a brief residence in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in the mid-1950s, Brown opened a photography studio and became an editor at Sepia magazine. Brown returned to Indianapolis in 1956 and established a new studio on the city's eastside, where he concentrated on portraits and did freelance photography, including work for the Indianapolis Recorder. During his twenty-year career, cut short due to a heart ailment, Brown photographed Dizzy Gillespie, jazz trombonist Jimmy Cleveland, the Hampton Sisters, the Milt Buckner Trio, and The Mills Brothers, among others. He also photographed local churches, businesses, and street scenes, as well as notable individuals in Indianapolis's African-American community and nationally known boxers Joe Louis and Sugar Ray Robinson. Brown, who grew up in Indianapolis and attended Crispus Attucks High School, also studied at Tennessee A and I (now known as Tennessee State University) in Nashville, Tennessee, and a photography school in Chicago, Illinois, before returning to his hometown to begin his career as a photographer. Brown was a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity, a thirty-second degree Prince Hall Mason, and also served as an assistant pastor at Indianapolis‚Äôs Martindale Avenue Church of Christ. Many of his photographs from the 1940s and 1950s are included the collection of the Indiana Historical Society. Early life and education Emmett Isom Brown Jr., the son of Alberta S. and Emmett I. Brown Sr., was born in 1918. Emmett Sr. was an Indianapolis, Indiana, dentist who later became senior pastor at the city's Martindale Avenue Church of Christ. Emmett Jr.'s siblings included two brothers, Paul L. and John C., both of whom became dentists, and three sisters, Doris M., Lauranne, and Lillian. Doris and Lillian became teachers in the Indianapolis public school system; Lauranne became a nurse. Brown's parents also had a foster daughter named Betty. Brown attended local public schools in Indianapolis, including Crispus Attucks High School.

Brown also received training at the American School of Photography in Chicago, Illinois. In addition to photography, Brown later became a thirty-second degree Prince Hall Mason. He also sang tenor in a trio at his church. Brown married Alta Jean King of Chattanooga, Tennessee, in 1947. They had four children, two sons and two daughters: Edmund G., Jean M., Laurence W., and Tammy J. Career After college, Brown returned to Indianapolis in the late 1940s and established the Brown Show Case, his own photography studio at 808 Indiana Avenue, next to George's Bar, a popular venue for local musicians. The studio's strategic location enabled Brown to photograph many entertainers and jazz musicians who performed along Indiana Avenue, the hub of the city's black entertainment and music scene. In mid-1950s Brown and his family relocated to Chattanooga, Tennessee, where he opened a photography studio and became an editor at Sepia magazine, a photo- journal publication that featured articles on African-American politics, music, and lifestyles. Brown stayed at the magazine only briefly and returned to his hometown of Indianapolis in 1956. After his return to Indianapolis, Brown established a home at 3518 Schofield Avenue and a photography studio on the city's eastside at 1665 Martindale Avenue (the present-day Doctor Andrew J. Brown Street), where he concentrated on portraits and did freelance photography.Smith, pp. 23‚Äì24. Brown was a photographer for the Indianapolis Recorder, the city's African-American newspaper. In addition to his photography work, Brown became an assistant pastor at Martindale Avenue Church of Christ, where his father served as senior pastor. Photographic works Brown continued to work as a professional photographer for more than twenty years, mostly in Indianapolis, Indiana, and briefly in Chattanooga, Tennessee. His most notable photographs document the popular jazz music scene in the 1940s and 1950s along Indianapolis's Indiana Avenue. Musical artists who appear in Brown's photographs include Dizzy Gillespie; jazz trombonist Jimmy Cleveland, who played with Lionel Hampton and recorded with Gillespie; the Hampton Sisters; the Willis Dyer Band, with Dyer playing a Hammond organ; drummer Les Fisher, who later played with Count Basie; Buddy Parker and his tenor saxophone; the Milt Buckner Trio, with Buckner on the piano and Hammond organ; and The Mills Brothers, among others.Smith, p. 25. See also: Brown also photographed notable individuals in Indianapolis's African-American community, including Judge Mercer Moore; Francis D. Hummons, a well-known local physician; and evangelist T. R. Murff, as well as nationally known boxers Joe Louis and Sugar Ray Robinson. Brown's photos also document the activities of Indianapolis churches and church groups, local businesses, street scenes, and his family members during the 1940s and 1950s. Death and legacy Brown suffered from a rheumatic heart condition and died on September 9, 1959, in Indianapolis, a year after undergoing open heart surgery. Funeral services were held at the Martindale Avenue Church of Christ, where he had served as assistant pastor. Brown was buried at Floral Park Cemetery in Indianapolis. Many of Brown's photographs from the 1940s and 1950s are included the collections of the Indiana Historical Society. Notes References   External links * Emmetti I.

Life  Ahmed Tlili was born into a family of struggling farmers at El Ksar, a town a little in the Gafsa mining region, slightly to the west of the precise centre of the French protectorate of Tunisia. He received his initial schooling locally and then moved to Tunis where he attended the prestigious Sadiki College. On completing his schooling he joined the postal service and returned to Gafsa in 1944. Here he worked with Farhat Hached on creating the \\"Union of Free Trades Unionists in the South\\" (\\"Union des syndicats libres du Sud\\") based in Sfax. His own particular priority was on looking after the interests of the mine workers. He played a very important part in creating the Tunisian General Labour Union (\\"l'Union g√©n√©rale tunisienne du travail\\" / UGTT), elected a member of its administrative commission at its constitutional congress in January 1946. Tlilli is frequently identified as the instigator of the armes independence struggle in the Gafsa region but his role remained limited. He also supported the National Liberation Front in Algeria and other liberation movements in Africa. Accused of participation in the \\"Stah operation\\" Tlili was arrested on 13 February 1952: he was released in July 1954. After independence he became a member (and treasurer) of the Politburo of the Neo Destour (political party) between 1954 and 1963. He was also, between 1956 and 1963, secretary general of the UGTT. He succeeded in gaining access and influence in the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), and played a decisive role in creating its African regional organisation. He was also behind the establishment of several co-operative operations which enabled the UGTT to finance the means to consolidate its autonomy and strengthen its role in Tunisian society. Tlili also took courageous positions in support of democratisation and human rights. In 1958 began to distance himself publicly from the president, criticising his autocratic methods and, notably, refusing to subordinate the UGTT to the country's ruling party. In July 1965 he slipped out of Tunisia and headed for Europe where he made statements that were hostile to the Bourguiba r√©gime. In January 1966, a year before he died, he published a powerful indictment of the government under the title \\"Letter to Bourgiba\\" (\\"Lettre √† Bourguiba\\")Lettre √† Bourguiba : janvier 1966, √©d. Fondation Ahmed Tlili, Tunis, 2011 () which displeased the authorities. On 18 November 1966 the Chamber of Deputies (national parliament) endorsed the withdrawal of his seat in the assembly and he was forced into a European exile. He nevertheless returned to Tunis on 25 March 1967. His health declined rapidly and three months later, on 25 June 1967, he died in Paris. His body was repatriated and buried in Tunis at the Jellaz Cemetery, in the corner reserved for those who had taken a lead in creating an independent Tunisia.  Personal  Abderrahmane Tlili, the son of Ahmed Tlili, also became involved in Tunisian politics. He was noted for his opposition to the r√©gime of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.  Celebration  The 42nd anniversary of his death was marked by a contemplative ceremony attended by :fr:Abdessalem JeradAbdessalem Jerad secreatary general of the UGTT, along with members of the union's executive committee, other union officials and members, and members of his family.

Wilson and the psychologist Richard Herrnstein. Summary Wilson and Herrnstein present and critique almost all major theories of the etiology of crime, with the notable exception of critical theory. The book is especially critical of mainstream sociological theories of crime. They also argue that crime primarily results from intrinsic aspects of human nature, rather than from psychological or environmental factors, and that biology and genetics play an important role in the causation of crime. Reception Writing in The New York Times, the social scientist John Kaplan wrote in his review of Crime and Human Nature that \\"there is no doubt that this is an important book and will be the starting place for discussions of the subject for years to come.\\" In a more mixed review of the book, Susan Jaco wrote that \\"The authors' point of view is buried amid so many tedious studies ‚Äì many of which could just as easily be summed up in aphorisms like \\"the apple doesn't fall far from the tree\\" ‚Äì that it is difficult to discern their real opinions on the causes and prevention of crime.\\" Nevertheless, she concluded that the book \\"...will be useful to anyone who wishes to have access, in one volume, to most of the important criminological studies of the past 50 years.\\" Impact Crime and Human Nature was called \\"the most important book on crime to appear in a decade\\" by the law professor John Monahan in 1986. Also in 1986, Michael Nietzel and Richard Milich wrote of the book that \\"Seldom does a book written by two academicians generate the interest and spark the debate that this one has,\\" noting that by February 1986, it had been reviewed by at least 20 publications. The book was particularly controversial because it re- invigorated the nature versus nurture debate in criminology. The book also influenced Herbert Needleman to research the potential link between lead and crime. In 2012, The Washington Posts Matt Schudel wrote that the book was \\"one of [Wilson's] most controversial books\\".

She is best known for her research which claims that there is no such thing as a \\"male brain\\" or a \\"female brain\\". Joel's research has been criticized by other neuroscientists who argue that male and female brains, on average, show distinct differences and can be classified with a high level of accuracy. Joel is a member of The NeuroGenderings Network, an international group of researchers in gender studies and neuroscience. They are critical of what they call 'neurosexism' in the scientific community. Joel has given lectures on her work in both scientific and lay conventions around the world. Since 2003, Joel has served as the head of the psychobiology department at Tel Aviv University, and in 2013 was appointed chair of the PhD committee of the School of Psychological Sciences.  Academic career  According to Joel, the brain is a \\"mosaic\\" of the male and female Joel began her academic career during her compulsory military service, in the Talpiot program, which she left after a year and a half. After completing her military service, Joel enrolled in the Tel Aviv University program for outstanding students. She completed a bachelor's degree in medical science, followed by a doctorate in psychobiology (1998), which focused on how connections in the brain are organized. She then joined the faculty of neuroscience, after receiving an Alon fellowship for young Israeli scientists. Her main area of research for 15 years was the cerebral mechanisms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). One of the main questions in Joel's research is whether there is a \\"male brain\\" and a \\"female brain\\"; whether human brains can be divided in a binary way, as is generally done with human genitals. According to Joelj's research, the answer is \\"no\\". One of the most important studies on which Joel's theory is based was done by pharmacologist Margaret McCarthy from the University of Maryland. McCarthy found that characteristics in male and female animal brains can cause changes in their shapes as a result of external circumstances such as stress. Joel concluded from the results of this study and other studies she examined that if under pressure certain areas of the brain can turn from their typical \\"female form\\" to the typical \\"male form\\" ‚Äì there is no point in talking about a female brain and a male brain, and that this division is meaningless. According to Joel, the brain has no sex, and the differences between \\"female\\" and \\"male\\" brains, though they exist, are minor and unrelated to each other. She was the first to talk about correlation in the context of the brain: a particular area of the brain, such as a large amygdala, does not predict anything about a different part of the brain, say, a small hippocampus. Although there are differences in the brain between males and females, they are not organized.TEDxJaffa, Dapha Joel: Are Brains Male or Female? Oct 8, 2012 Thus, if a \\"male\\" characteristic is found in a particular area, it does not actually mean anything about the masculinity or femininity of the other brain characteristics, which are determined by the complex interactions between sex, genetics and the environment. Joel's conclusions have been challenged by others in the field of neuroscience, and she met with obstacles getting her first study on the subject published in 2011: Male or Female? Brains are Intersex. Joel is a member of The NeuroGenderings Network and has advocated in the media for a less gender essentialist approach to neuroscience. :See also:  Gender and feminism  Joel counts gender and feminism among her research interests. In an interview with The Marker, she said that even as a child and during her military service (ages 18‚Äì20) she expressed feminist views. Joel claims that in the gendered western world, males (as identified by their genitals) are channeled into being \\"boys\\", and genitally identified females ‚Äì into \\"girls\\". According to Joel, the common social and cultural perception is one that divides the world of possibilities into two parts. In her opinion, in a world without gender, where there is no social and cultural significance to the shape of a person's genitals, there will be many more possibilities for both females and males. In 2009, Joel began \\"Women/Men Conflict Groups\\" for psychology undergraduates, a program created by Prof. Ariella Friedman, according to a model developed in dialog groups of Jews and Arabs in Neve Shalom. Later, she developed a working model for groups dealing with gender issues, which combines the conflict group model with the awareness group model from the 1970s. Based on this model, she began designing a course in psychology and gender ‚Äì \\"Is pink a girl color?\\", which examined social conventions such as what is \\"feminine\\" and \\"masculine,\\" and people's attitudes, often unconscious, towards various things from the perspective of their gender. The preparation of this course led Joel to her research into the \\"male brain\\" and \\"female brain\\" in the early 2000s.

She was the daughter of Samuel de Constant de Rebecque and Charlotte Pictet (herself a daughter of a professor of law at the Geneva Academy). She left an important correspondence, notably with her cousin Benjamin Constant, as well as a painted herbarium with over 1,200 pages. Life Voltaire encouraged the marriage of her parents. Doctors Jean Baumgartner (died 1790) and Th√©odore Tronchin (1709‚Äì1781) are also among their neighbors. The Constant's, landowners, are linked to the great families of the region such as the Saussure, Chandieu, Charri√®re, Loys, and were very integrated in the social, cultural and economic life. Samuel and Charlotte had four children: Rosalie, Lisette (1759‚Äì1837), Juste (1760‚Äì1793) and Charles (1762‚Äì1835), later called \\"Charles the Chinese\\" because of his travels and stays in China between 1779 and 1793. After the death of Charlotte in 1766, the family was in financial difficulties. Under these circumstances, Rosalie took on the role of elder sister, but broke her shoulder in an accident in 1767, which will leave her disabled all her life. Rosalie will have a half brother born from the second marriage of her father, Victor (1773‚Äì1853), who is part of the Swiss Guard of Louis XVI and who narrowly escapes death at the Tuileries during the massacre of 10 August 1792. Rosalie quickly took the habit of writing in notebooks (called Cahiers verts) with very different content: cooking recipes, personal remarks, verses, travel journal etc. In the 1770s, the family moved closer to the Lausanne branch of the Constant family. Rosalie and her cousin, Benjamin Constant, became friends. Later on, they exchanged an important correspondence, which ended only with the death of Benjamin in 1830. Because of his financial problems, Samuel settled in Lausanne in 1787, at the property of La Chabli√®re. This belonged to the father of Benjamin, Juste de Constant, who lived in a neighboring property, Desert. The social, cultural and intellectual life of the Lausanne elite was then dynamic with the presences of Gibbon, Jacques-Georges Deyverdun, and Tissot. The city became an international attraction and, after the Revolution, a point of departure for the emigrants. Rosalie also shared a strong friendship with her cousin Constance d'Hermenches (1755‚Äì1825), who became Constance de Cazenove d'Arlens after her marriage in 1787. Constance had met the young Germaine de Sta√´l, and Benjamin Constant met Germaine de Stael on September 18, 1794. Rosalie admired Germaine de Stael, but when the relationship between her cousin and Necker's daughter became tumultuous, she remained on the side of Benjamin, her confidante. For about two years, between 1791 and 1793, Rosalie maintained an epistolary idyll with Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint- Pierre. But the author of Paul and Virginie ended their exchanges when he learns that Rosalie is poor and infirm. Beginning in 1797, Rosalie remained with Madame de Charri√®re-Bavois, the first cousin of her father, and whose salon is one of the most important in Lausanne. Edward Gibbon, Jacques-Georges Deyverdun, Joseph-Michel-Antoine Servan or the future Madame de Montolieu met there. Rosalie's passion for botany, drawing and painting is further enhanced by this context. As early as 1795, Rosalie had begun a painted herbarium, which she would pursue until the end of her life, and which could be part of a wider current during the Enlightenment. She was encouraged in her work by Mathieu de Montmorency, during a mountain trip. The herbarium was a kind of refuge for Rosalie in the face of concerns about the precariousness of the family's financial situation. Twice a month, she tried to sell her herbarium, without success. As early as 1804, Rosalie had a long friendship with the novelist Claire de Duras, author of Ourika and also passionate about botany. In 1819, Rosalie undertook a journey, which she reported in A Journey to Switzerland in 1819, during which she was hosted by the botanist Nicolas Charles Seringe. From 1820 to her death in 1834, she lived successively in Lausanne, near Saint-Jean, and in Geneva. During her last years, with her brother Charles, she frequented Albertine Necker de Saussure (cousin of Germaine de Stael), Sismondi, Charles Victor of Bonstetten, √âdouard Diodati, and Chateaubriand and his wife, with whom she found accommodation in Lausanne. Rosalie did not marry, although she had been asked to marry at least twice, the second by General de Montesquiou.

It is a colonial coral which is partly encrusting and partly forms laminate plates or tiers. It is native to the western and central Indo-Pacific. Description Colonies of E. aspera are quite diverse in form and may be up to across. Some are encrusting but others are hummocky or have thickened sections, with plates, whorls or tiers which tend to lie parallel to the underlying surface. The corallites (stony cups in which the polyps sit) are usually level with the surface but may be protuberant in some colonies. They are normally only on the upper surface of leaves and plates. Small colonies may have a large central corallite and a number of widely spaced peripheral ones, with septo-costae (stony ridges) radiating from the central one. As the colony grows, the distinction between the main and peripheral corallites is lost. The septo- costae are spiny on the upper surfaces but the costae on the lower surfaces are smooth. This coral is usually some shade of brown, green or red, sometimes with the oral discs of the polyps being a contrasting colour. This coral is easily confused with Oxypora lacera underwater. Distribution and habitat E. aspera is native to the western and central Indo-Pacific region. Its range extends from the Red Sea and Madagascar to Japan, Australia and many Pacific island groups. Although some colonies are found near the crests of reefs in shallow water, it is more common at middle depths of between where it is generally found in sheltered fore reef habitats where it has a preference for shaded locations. Status Corals are principally threatened by habitat loss due to the destruction of reefs and by global warming. However, E. aspera is likely to be more resilient than some other species because it is widespread and common, and occurs at mid-depths. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has therefore rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

For online access see https://www.getty.edu/publications/virtuallibrary/9780892363353.html In 1996, it received two further awards: the Spiro Kostof Book Award for Architecture and Urbanism from the Society of Architectural Historians, and the Albert Hourani Book Award of the Middle East Studies Association. The book interprets central defining themes of Islamic art such as geometric ornament and the muqarnas, through the hitherto overlooked centrality of designs on paper in premodern architectural practice. It features the facsimile of a unique 30-meter design scroll, with two- and three-dimensional geometric patterns and calligraphy for architectural ornament, which she attributes to late fifteenth-century Timurid-Turkmen Iran, particularly Tabriz. Her book demonstrates the crucial role of mathematical sciences in the theory and practice of architecture and the ornamental geometric mode known as girih.Yvonne Dold-Samplonius, Book Review, Historia Mathematica 26/2 (1999): 166-172. Also see Ann Powell, ‚ÄúNeoplatonism and Geometry in Islamic Art,‚Äù Art History21/1: (1998):135-139. In his book review, Walter Denny remarks that ‚ÄúThis theme of relation between science and art in Islam has been so often repeated in survey texts as to have become almost a clich√©, but the actual relationships between theoretical studies and what Necipoƒülu calls ‚Äòpractical geometry‚Äô used in the creation of art have never before been carefully and meticulously linked to this degree in the literature.‚ÄùWalter B. Denny, Book Review, Speculum 73/2 (1998): 566-568. In her seminal work, Necipoƒülu challenges orientalist and reductionist assumptions regarding the meaning and function of geometry in Islamic art. She investigates in depth the intellectual and cultural contexts of the scroll, exploring multiple meanings and perceptions of geometrical designs in line with philosophical and aesthetic theories current in the medieval Islamic world. Oleg Grabar‚Äôs book jacket endorsement reads, ‚ÄúJust about the best book on Islamic art for the past one hundred years. It is a masterpiece that establishes our understanding of why geometry became so important in Islamic art.‚Äù According to Priscilla Soucek, the book ‚Äúgoes far beyond the explication of a set of architectural drawings. Its ambitious scope and painstaking documentation provide a new foundation for considering the role of geometric ornament in the visual traditions of the medieval Islamic world, and indeed initiate a wider debate about how to interpret the other ornamental traditions used in pre-modern Islamic regions.‚ÄùPriscilla Soucek, Book Review, International Journal of Middle East Studies 30/1 (1998): 131-133. Godfrey Goodwin lauds Necipoƒülu‚Äôs intellectual analysis as ‚Äúimmaculate‚Äù and remarks that ‚ÄúFor anyone seriously studying Islamic art and the concepts underlying it, this work is and will be essential reading. New details may be added in time, but it will not be surpassed. It creates its own infinity.‚ÄùGodfrey Goodwin, Book Review, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society 6/3 (1996): 434-435. The Topkapƒ± Scroll was translated into Persian in 2000. The Getty Virtual Library provides a full copy of the book in English.

The book attracted world-wide acclaim for its innovative interpretation of works by the renowned chief architect Sinan (d. 1588), from the perspective of his ‚Äúcodification of decorum‚Äù in canonical Ottoman architecture according to the ‚Äúrelative status of patrons and building sites.‚ÄùFor an interview with Necipoglu on the Age of Sinan, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lI9w68K6Glw Previous scholarship on Sinan‚Äôs oeuvre was dominated by the chronological development of his style, as Howard Crane notes, ‚ÄúIt is the great strength of Necipoƒülu‚Äôs work that she transcends this formalist paradigm and, by means of a truly groundbreaking examination of the rich but hitherto unexplored corpus of surviving documentary sources ‚Äì archival records, vakfiyes, contemporary historical, diplomatic, and travel accounts ‚Äì establishes the historical context for the chief architect‚Äôs work.‚ÄùHoward Crane, Book Review, Journal of Islamic Studies 20/2 (2009): 274-277.

A spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office said that the assailant shouted \\"Allahu Akbar\\" twice as he rushed the soldiers, attacking them from behind. In addition to the large knife with which he attacked, Ayaanle was carrying a replica of a gun and a copy of the Quran. The alleged assailant, Haashi Ayaanle, worked for Victor Buyck Steel Construction in Eeklo as a welder from 2013 until April 2017. He was let go by the company after an incident in April 2017 when he attempted to attack fellow workers with a screwdriver. Although Ayaanle's fellow workers asserted that there had been no motive for the attack, Ayaanle told his attorney that they were peeking at him in his home and taking clandestine photos of him, causing the lawyer to request a mental status examination and resulting in Ayaanle being voluntarily hospitalized at St. Jan psychiatric hospital in Eeklo. He was discharged after three weeks, with advice to continue taking his prescribed medication. He found work again for a short time, before falling out of contact, even with his attorney. Ayaanle was reported as having been in contact with members of the Somali fundamentalist community. Reactions The Amaq News Agency, claimed that Islamic State was responsible for the attack. According to the Amaq statement, \\"the perpetrator of the stabbing operation in Brussels is one of the soldiers of the Islamic State, and he carried out the operation in response to appeals to target countries of the [US-led] coalition\\". The Belgian Secretary of Interior, Jan Jambon, praised the soldiers and the police. Europol classified the incident as jihadist terrorism in its report about terrorism in Europe during 2017.

Career and research Woods spent two years as a research fellow at St John's College and as a Green Scholar at the University of California, San Diego before taking up a lectureship for 5 years at the Institute of Theoretical Geophysics, Cambridge. After three years as professor of applied mathematics at University of Bristol, he was appointed BP Professor and head of the BP Institute, University of Cambridge. His work is characterised by the development of simplified mathematical and experimental models of complex fluid flow processes covering a wide range of phenomena from the dynamics of explosive volcanic eruptions, to geothermal power generation, carbon sequestration and enhanced oil recovery in heterogeneous porous rocks. His work on the dynamics of mixing in turbulent buoyant plumes and gravity currents has led to new insights about the ascent height of volcanic eruption columns and the run-out distance of pyroclastic flow, as well as constraints on the dynamics of hydrothermal and oil plumes in the deep sea. He has also developed fundamental understanding of ventilation flows in buildings, developing strategies to minimise heat loss associated with low-energy natural ventilation, as well as exploring the controls on the dispersal of air-borne infection. Other work has included modelling the dynamics of traffic flows, to elucidate controls on the collective behaviour of individual vehicles and strategies to regulate the flow. =Awards and honours= Woods was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2017.

History The original farmhouse dates from the early 16th century. In the 17th century, the house was extended and a new range constructed to a traditional H-plan. In the 18th century, the building was reduced in size, particularly impacting on the original 16th century building, of which little remains but the two-storey porch, which formed the dairy to the 18th century house. The farmhouse remains a private residence and the architectural historian John Newman remarks on a \\"careful restoration\\" dating from 1995 to 1996. Architecture and description Cadw records that the farmhouse is of two storeys with attics. The building is of stone, which has been rendered, under a stone tile roof. The interior shows evidence that the farmhouse may have housed two separate households in the 17th century. The farmhouse is listed Grade II*. Adjacent to the house is the \\"impressive\\" seven-bay barn dating from the 17th century, which has its own Grade II listing.

The league also relaxes the rules for cleats, batting gloves, wristbands, compression sleeves, catcher's masks, and bats, allowing players to use custom-designed gear. The multi-day event is designed to give players the opportunity to express their personal style, appeal to the youth demographic, and acquaint hometown fans with newer team members. In a departure from previous seasons, the 2019 event saw monochromatic uniforms and caps. The all-white or all-black apparel was intended to make logos and accessories, which players were allowed to customize, stand out more. Origin MLB and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) announced the venture on August 10, 2017. According to the MLBPA website, CC Sabathia of the New York Yankees, Bo Schultz of the Toronto Blue Jays, and Josh Thole of the Arizona Diamondbacks were \\"instrumental in developing the concept\\" together with representatives from the MLBPA and MLB. The event was designed to give players the opportunity to express their personal style, and to acquaint hometown fans with newer team members. The introduction of colorful uniforms and nicknames also reached out to the youth demographic. The inaugural Players Weekend took place on August 25‚Äì27, 2017. Uniform details =Logo and uniforms= The \\"always smiling\\" Francisco Lindor of the Cleveland Indians chose the nickname \\"Mr. Smile\\" in 2017 Alcides Escobar (left) and Brandon Moss of the Kansas City Royals sport their nicknames on their jerseys at the 2017 event Charlie Blackmon of the Colorado Rockies identified as \\"Chuck Nazty\\" at the 2018 event In 2017, the usual MLB logo on the caps and uniforms was replaced by a new logo depicting the evolution of a ball player from Little League to the major leagues. In 2017 and 2018, each team wore a pullover jersey (similar to what many teams wore in the 1970s and 1980s), as opposed to the traditional button-down jersey, with contrasting sleeve colors. The team uniforms, which took their color cues from youth sportswear, were designed by Majestic Athletic. The jerseys had a \\"tribute patch\\" on the right sleeve where each player could write under the words \\"Thank You\\" the names of those who had the most influence on his life and career. \\"Mom\\" and \\"Dad\\" were the most popular picks; players also saluted other family members and religious figures. The player's surname (or, in the case of Ichiro Suzuki, his given name) usually printed on the back of the jersey was replaced with a nickname of the player's choosing. Players were encouraged, but not required, to choose a nickname. All uniforms, whether or not the players chose to use nicknames, have names on the back‚Äîincluding those of the New York Yankees, a team that had never before placed names on the back of any official jersey. The choice of nicknames runs the gamut from shortened monikers and initials to rhymes, puns, and descriptive epithets. Game-used jerseys are sold after the event, with proceeds benefiting the MLB-MLBPA Youth Development Foundation. Players are also allowed to wear T-shirts sporting the name and logo of the charity of their choice during batting practice, pregame workouts, and post-game interviews. In the 2017 event, St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Seung-hwan Oh imprinted his name in Korean characters (Ïò§ÏäπÌôò). A few players were not able to use their preferred nickname due to potential copyright or trademark infringement, such as \\"Superman\\" (Kevin Pillar), \\"Kojak\\" (Adri√°n Beltr√©), \\"Led Zeflin\\" (Zach Eflin), and \\"Hoby Wan Kenobi\\" (Hoby Milner). Chicago Cubs pitcher Carl Edwards Jr. was the only player allowed to use a brand name, Carl's Jr., on the back of his jersey; Edwards Jr. also imprinted the restaurant chain's logo on one of his cleats. In 2018, Brad Boxberger had his surname on the back of his jersey, but in the form of emojis (\\"üì¶üçî\\") instead of letters. For the 2019 event, Walker Lockett had his surname in the form of an emoji as a simple lock (\\"üîí\\"). Russell Martin, whose nickname is \\"The Muscle\\", chose \\"El üí™üèª\\". Cleveland Indians players Carlos Carrasco (\\"cookieüç™\\"), Mike Clevinger (\\"peace sign‚òÆ, sunshine‚òÄÔ∏è\\") and Francisco Lindor were among those who chose to wear emojis on their jerseys, though Lindor sandwiched \\"Mr. Smile\\" between two smiley faces. Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Hyun-Jin Ryu chose his nickname in Korean writing (\\"Î•òÌòÑÏßÑ\\"). In 2019, several players opted to use their nickname to honor Tyler Skaggs, who died earlier in the season, while all players wore a \\"45\\" patch in his honor. =Other gear= The New Era Cap Company supplies caps. In 2017, socks in multicolored hues were the same for all 30 teams; players had the option of rolling up the cuffs of their pants to show off the design. The socks are supplied by Stance. Players are allowed to wear brightly colored and custom-designed cleats, batting gloves, wristbands, compression sleeves, and catcher's masks that are typically not permitted under MLB rules. The league did prohibit the use of white as a color for the batting gloves, wristbands, and compression sleeves, since it might interfere with umpires' ability to judge a play. Players can also custom- design their bats. Sam Bat, a bat supplier to the league, produced dozens of custom-ordered bats for the 2017 event that were painted with different colors, images, and country flags. After the 2017 event, Curtis Granderson raffled off his three pairs of customized cleats online; anyone who donated at least $50 to his charity, Grand Kids Foundation, during the weekend was eligible to win. For the 2019 event, the league allowed players to use mobile devices and tablets in dugouts and on the field before the game. 2019 monochromatic uniforms Ryan O'Hearn of the Kansas City Royals (left) wears the all-white uniform on the road and Yu Chang and Sandy Alomar, Jr. of the Cleveland Indians wear the all-black uniform at Progressive Field during Players Weekend in 2019 For 2019, MLB mandated that all uniforms and caps be either all-white or all-black, with the home team getting the first choice of color and the visiting team wearing the other color option. Batting helmets would be either matte-black or matte-white, depending on the color the team has chosen. The one exception to the monochromatic uniform look was the pitcher on the \\"white\\" team, who wore a black cap with his white jersey and pants in order not to obstruct hitters from seeing the ball. Nicknames were sewn onto the back of both white and black jerseys in silver. The monochromatic apparel was intended to make logos and accessories, which players were allowed to customize, stand out more. Reactions Players Weekend was initially hailed by MLB players as a long-overdue opportunity to express their personal style on the field. According to SB Nation, 58 players across the league declined to choose a nickname in 2017, instead using their first or last name on their jerseys. New York Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner, whose team had never had a name on the back of the jersey, wanted no name at all, but he was overruled; he ended up printing his surname. While most players enjoyed custom designing their cleats and other gear, Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Andrew Chafin opted to wear his regular black cleats. Reaction to the 2019 monochrome uniforms by fans, sportswriters, and even team personnel was overwhelmingly negative. Fans on social media posts compared them to trash bags, chess pieces and even the Spy vs. Spy cartoon from Mad magazine. A USA Today reporter wrote: \\"If you're checking out highlights from across the league, every game looks the same\\". Cleveland Indians manager Terry Francona jokingly said that he didn't plan to make mound visits during Players Weekend so no one would see him wearing the uniform; he added: \\"What's the slogan, 'Let the kids play?' Let the grown-ups look like morons\\". Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts compared the jerseys to \\"an ugly Christmas sweater\\". The Chicago Cubs let MLB know their dissatisfaction with the uniforms by wearing their traditional royal blue caps on the first day of Players Weekend. However, MLB let the Cubs know they did not approve of this decision, and the team wore the designated white caps the rest of the weekend.https://beta.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/08/26/mlb-wanted-make- baseball-fun-with-players-weekend-jerseys-it-backfired/?outputType=amp References External links *\\"MLB's Jordan Athletes Receive Custom Air Jordan 12 Cleats for Players Weekend\\" (photo gallery) Sole Collector, August 26, 2017 Category:Recurring sporting events established in 2017 Category:Major League Baseball competitions Category:Major League Baseball culture * ","title":"Players Weekend"},{"id":"55030150","text":"Washbourne may refer to: * Washbourne, Devon, England, a hamlet * Mona Washbourne (1903-1988), English actress * Thomas Washbourne (1606-1687), English clergyman and poet See also * Great Washbourne, Gloucestershire, England, a village * Little Washbourne, Gloucestershire, England, a village * Washburn (disambiguation) ","title":"Washbourne"},{"id":"55030207","text":"Elymnias obnubila is a butterfly in the family Nymphalidae.

Duncombe Park, 1839 Duncombe was the eldest son of Thomas Duncombe, of Duncombe Park, North Yorkshire and his wife, Mary Slingsby, daughter of Sir Thomas Slingsby. He was educated at Westminster School from an early age in 1732, and matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford on 18 May 1742, aged 17. He succeeded his father to Duncombe Park in 1746 and is also known as Thomas Duncombe III. In 1751, Duncombe was returned as Member of Parliament for the Downton constituency. In 1754 he was elected MP for Morpeth. On the death of his cousin Lord Feversham in 1763 he inherited an interest at Downton, and in 1768 was returned to Parliament unopposed. In 1774 his control of the Downton seat was challenged and he was unseated on petition. He was returned unopposed for Downton in 1779, but died a few weeks later on 23 November 1779. There is no record of his having spoken in Parliament. Family Duncombe married firstly Lady Diana Howard daughter of Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle on 9 February 1749. He married secondly Anne Jennings, daughter of Sir Philip Jennings Clerke, Bt on 24 February 1772. He married thirdly Charlotte Hale, daughter of William Hale of King's Walden, Hertfordshire on 25 June 1778. Duncombe's daughter Anne married Robert Shafto. Having no sons, Duncombe's estates at Barford, near Downton and Duncombe Park devolved to his younger brother Charles Slingsby Duncombe and thence to Charles Duncombe, 1st Baron Feversham.

It is the only original song on the album and was co-written by Allman with the guitarist and bandleader Scott Sharrard, forming the album's lead single. The song has the theme of time running out at the end of life. Allman was ill at the time and died on May 27, 2017, not long after the recording. Allman repeats the lyric \\"I hope you're haunted by the music of my soul, when I'm gone\\" throughout the song. Sharrard secretly wrote the song in the voice of Gregg's late brother, Duane Allman, speaking to him. The rest of the album consists of cover songs. A video of Allman and other musicians is associated with the song. \\\\- The song has been called \\"hauntingly beautiful\\".

Organosilanols are a group of chemical silicon compounds. More specifically, they are carbosilanes derivatized with a hydroxy group on the silicon atom. Organosilanols are the silicon analogs to alcohols. Silanols are more acidic and more basic than their alcohol counterparts and therefore show a rich structural chemistry characterized by hydrogen bonding networks which are particularly well studied for silanetriols.,  Preparation  Organosilanols can be obtained by hydrolysis of organohalosilanes, such as chlorotrimethylsilane. They can also be prepared by the oxidation of organosilanes with oxidizing agents or by hydrolysis in the alkaline. :\\\\mathrm{(H_3C)_3SiCl + \\\\ H_2O \\\\longrightarrow (H_3C)_3SiOH + \\\\ HCl} :\\\\mathrm{R_2SiCl_2 + \\\\ 2 \\\\ HgO \\\\xrightarrow[-80\\\\, {}^{\\\\circ}C]{toluene} R_2Si(OH)_2 + \\\\ 2 \\\\ Hg^0 \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ R=organic \\\\ residue} :\\\\mathrm{R_3SiH + \\\\ H_2O \\\\longrightarrow R_3SiOH + \\\\ H_2 \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ R=organic \\\\ residue} The hydrolysis of silyl ethers generally proceeds only slowly: :\\\\mathrm{(H_5C_2)_3SiOC_2H_5 + \\\\ H_2O \\\\longrightarrow (H_5C_2)_3SiOH + \\\\ HOC_2H_5} Hydrolysis of organosilanes is a first-order reaction. The hydrolysis rate of the Si-H bond depends on the type and number of organic residues. Thus, the hydrolysis rate of trialkylsilanes is significantly slower than that of triarylsilanes. This can be explained by a stronger increase in electron density on the silicon atom by the alkyl groups. Correspondingly, the reaction rate of the tri-n-alkylsilanes decreases in the series of ethyl, propyl, butyl groups. Trialkylsilanes with n-alkyl residues react by a factor of 10 faster than the analogous silanes with branched alkyl residues.  Classification  Depending on the substitution pattern of the silicon atom, a further distinction can be made. Organosilanols are classified as: * organosilanetriols, when three hydroxy groups and an organic residue are bound to a silicon atom, e. g. methylsilanetriol, phenylsilanetriol * organosilandiols, when two hydroxy groups and two organic residues are bound to a silicon atom, e. g. dimethylsilanediol, diphenylsilanediol * organosilanols, when one hydroxy group and three organic residues are bound to a silicon atom, e. g. trimethylsilanol, triethylsilanol or triphenylsilanol.
