The film is about the harrowing graduation night of eight Korean‚ÄìAmerican high school youths in Los Angeles that culminates in a violent crime that will forever change their lives. It World Premiered at CAAMFest (then called NAATA) in San Francisco in 1997 to three sold-out screenings. Yellow was invited to over a dozen film festivals, including the Los Angeles Film Festival, the Singapore International Film Festival and the Slamdance Film Festival. The film received a U.S. release by Phaedra Cinema and is sold worldwide through Cinema Arts. The film stars John Cho and Jason Tobin. Film critic Roger Ebert wrote about YELLOW on November 19, 1997, in his article HAWAII FEST HONORS FILMS OF PACIFIC RIM for the Chicago-Sun Times. \\"A different kind of culture shock was explored in \\"Yellow,\\" an American film by Chris Chan Lee, about the son of a strict Korean-American grocery owner in Los Angeles. The father enforces his standards so rigidly that he drives customers away. He alienates his son (Michael Daeho Chung), who during a long night with his Gen X Korean- American friends, deals with the consequences when a great deal of money is stolen from the store. The film is fascinating in the way it manages to be both about Korean-American society and about young Gen Xers who could be of any race.\\" In the Los Angeles Times, Kevin Thomas (film critic) reviewed the film for its theatrical release in 1998, in his article ‚ÄòYellow‚Äô Looks at Generation, Cultural Gap Within Families. \\"As ambitious and rewarding as it is, Chris Chan Lee‚Äôs ‚ÄúYellow‚Äù has a significance beyond itself: It‚Äôs the first major Korean American film to get a feature release. It‚Äôs also a classic coming-of-age story, set during one long night just before eight high school friends are to graduate. You‚Äôre tempted to describe the picture as ‚ÄúKorean American Graffiti,‚Äù but along with its humor it has an underlying disturbing seriousness.\\" The film critic added, \\" Through the specificity of this Korean American experience you can easily feel a sense of universality in Sin‚Äôs predicament. As a filmmaker Lee is at a point where he‚Äôs stronger at dialogue than pacing. But there‚Äôs no doubt ‚ÄúYellow‚Äù marks the debut of a most promising talent who combines youthful zest and energy with a mature perspective that allows him to extend compassion to both sides of the generation gap.\\" External links * References Category:1998 films Category:1998 drama films Category:Korean-American films Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in Los Angeles ","title":"Yellow (1998 film)"},{"id":"8029847","text":"Gyromitra gigas, commonly known as the snow morel, snow false morel, calf brain, or bull nose, is a fungus and a member of the Ascomycota.

It is suspected to contain hydrazines, though in the scientific literature its content in gyromitrin or hydrazine was never assessed or measured. No casualties have been ascribed to its consumption and it is thought to contain lower levels of gyromitrin than esculenta. Some guides have listed it as being edible if properly prepared.

From about 1720 until the early 19th century Woolley was the site of a gunpowder mill. In 1848 the village had a population of 84, and covered . Woolley is one of only 52 Thankful Villages for having lost no soldiers during World War I, and one of only 14 doubly thankful villages that also did not lose any soldiers in World War II. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The parish falls within the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, Trading Standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the Great Western Ambulance Service. Bath and North East Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in Bath. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Wansdyke district and the City of Bath of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Bathavon Rural District. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of North East Somerset. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. It is also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. Geography =Geology= The local geology of the Swainswick valley around Sopers Wood, in the south Cotswolds, has been investigated because of the presence of landslides since the work of William Smith in 1799. These are caused by the over-steepened topography downslope of the cap rock formed by the Great Oolite where water egresses around the plateau at the junction between the Great Oolite and the Fuller‚Äôs Earth formation and through the more permeable limestone bands within the Fuller‚Äôs Earth. Known locally as the Woolley Valley, there has been a dispute about development of green belt land. =Frogs and toads= Every year in February and March, Charlcombe Lane is closed by the local council to enable frogs and toads to cross the road in safety. During this period local residents and volunteers go out at dusk, the time of greatest movement, collecting them in buckets and depositing them on the other side of the road, allowing them to continue their journey safely towards a lake in the Charlcombe valley on a tributary of the Lam Brook. Religious sites Church of St Mary The Church of St Mary, is a very ancient stone edifice, dating from the 12th century. It is said to have been at one period the parish church of the city of Bath. It is a Grade II* listed building. There was believed to be a holy well in the grounds. According to tradition it was formerly the mother church of Bath, and received an annual acknowledgment of a pound of pepper from the abbey there. All Saints Church at Woolley dates from 1761 and was by John Wood, the Younger. It is Grade I listed. In Langridge the Church of St Mary Magdalene dates from the 12th century and has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building.

Zabala, also Zabalam ( zabalamki, modern Tell Ibzeikh, Dhi Qar Governorate, Iraq) was a city of ancient Sumer in what is now the Dhi Qar governorate in Iraq. Zabala was at the crossing of the ancient Iturungal and Ninagina canals, not far from Umma. The city's deity was Inanna of Zabala.

In the Sargonic Period, Rimush of Akkad reports Zabala as attempting to rebel against the control of the Akkadian Empire: Shar-kali-sharri and Naram-Sin both reported building a temple to the goddess Inanna in Zabala. Mari A.

Archaeology Beginning in the early 1900s, a great deal of illegal excavation occurred in Zabala. An example of writing from the time of Hammurabi was removed from Zabala during this period. This activity reached a new height in the 1990s, at which time the Iraqi State Organization of Antiquities and Heritage appears to have authorized an official excavation, the first at the site. It is not clear that the results were ever published. A further outbreak of archaeological looting at Zabala broke out after the 2003 War in Iraq.

History The game was first played in Australia in 1939, having been introduced to the country by Gordon Young of Canada, who at the time was the director of physical education in New South Wales. Prior to the Second World War, vigoro was one of the sports played by women in Australia. With the introduction of softball during the war, the game fell out of popularity and was replaced with softball in the eastern states. The game was introduced to a wider audience in 1942 by American nurses stationed in the country during the war. Their matches were organized by US Army Sargeant William Duvernet. The Victorian Women's Softball Association was created two years later in 1944. The association at the time of its founding had 20 teams, 250 members and staged regular competitions. Women's participation in softball led to a decline in the number of women participating in cricket at this time. A Queensland organisation was created in 1946 by the American Mack Gilley. By 1946, the big states had their own association. In 1947, at the behest of Queensland, the first interstate championships were held in Brisbane, with the Victorians claiming victory. Only New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland competed at the innaurgal event. There were efforts by the Australian Softball Council as early as 1950 to get softball on the Olympic programme for possible inclusion at the 1956 Summer Olympics. After the failure of getting softball on the 1956 Olympic programme, an attempt was made by Western Australians to get softball included on the schedule at the 1962 British Empire Games that were going to be held in Perth. Empire Games organisers did not support this as they allowed neither team sports, nor demonstration sports at the Games. Governance The first national organisation for women's softball was created in 1947 as a result of talks at the first interstate championships and named the Australian Women's Softball Council. It was originally composed of representatives from New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland and Victoria. Other states and territories were later added: Western Australia in 1951, Tasmania in 1952, the Australian Capital Territory in 1961, and the Northern Territory in 1978. The organisation would later change its name do the Australian Softball Federation. Australia's national organisation was recognised by the international governing body, the International Softball Federation, in 1953. In 1995, the organisation was based in Bayswater, Victoria and had 60,000 members. Funding The national team has not secured as much funding as male dominated sports in Australia despite having performed better than some and having won major international competitions. As of 1999, softball was not being supported by all state and territory based institute of sports. Only the ACT, the New South Wales Institute of Sport, the Queensland Academy of Sport and the Victorian Institute of Sport did. The federal government allocated money to sport through a variety of methods. When combined, softball was allocated in 1995/1996, in 1996/1997, in 1997/1998, in 1998/1999, and in 1999/2000. National championships alt=sign for softball centre There are several national championships held for men and women in Australia. The championships occur every year, with hosting rights given to states in the order they were admitted to the Australian Women's Softball Council. The championships are the Mack Gilley Shield for the open women, the Elinor McKenzie Shield for the U19 women, the Ester Deason Shield for the U16 women, the John Reid Shield for the open men, and the Nox Bailey Shield for the U19 men. In the Gilley Shield, Victoria won every Shield between 1947 and 1951, Western Australia won in 1952 and 1953 before Victoria won again in 1954. Western Australia won in 1955 with the South Australians winning in 1965. Victoria won in consecutively in 1957 and 1958, before Western Australia went on to win in 1959. Victoria went on a winning streak again winning in 1960, 1961 and 1962. Queensland interrupted their streak with a win in 1963. Victoria won again in 1964 and 1965. Queensland and Victoria went on to trade wins with Queensland in 1966, Victoria in 1967 and Queensland in 1968. Play Softball is played in Australia during the summer and the winter. Education The University of Melbourne required physical education students to learn about softball as part of the programme's curriculum. This helped spur the inclusion of the sport in the curriculum at secondary schools and colleges around the state of Victoria. International competitions Parade of Olympians ‚Äì Sydney 2008 ‚Äì Women's softball team Australian women competed in their first international competition in 1949 when they played a series against New Zealand in St Kilda at the St Kilda Cricket Ground. 10,000 people watched the game live. The first international for Australian women took place in 1951 when the Australians toured New Zealand. Australia won both games against the New Zealanders. In 1960, Australia hosted its first international tournament with national teams from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa competing. At the tournament, Australia beat South Africa by a score of 2-1. Australia hosted the event again in 1962, where they beat the New Zealanders in the final 2-1. At the ISF Women's World Championship, Australia finished first in 1965 and second in 1998. The 1965 victory was considered very impressive as they beat the Americans, who invented the game in 1887, to win the championship. Between 1949 and 1967, Australia's senior women's side was undefeated in international play. On television The first softball World Series, called the Diamond International trophy, was hosted by Australia. World television rights were sold for the event by the International Softball Federation for . Participation In 1995, an estimated 200,000 children regularly played softball in organised school based games. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders Australian aboriginals have represented the country as members of the national team. One such player was Joanne Lesiputty, born in 1966, who also represented Australia in a number of other sports including basketball and netball. Her selection to the senior national softball team occurred in 1987. She was granted a federal scholarship for \\"young Aboriginal sporting achievers\\" in 1989. Australian aboriginals have been present on state representative sides for softball including Rose Damaso who represented the Northern Territory. Softball is the most popular sport for Aboriginal women to play. In March 2012, Softball Australia and the federal government announced a program to further increase aboriginal participation in softball as a way of promoting healthier lifestyles in the community. Men Men's softball being played in the Australian Capital Territory A national men's association for softball was created in 1949 and was the first of its kind for men's softball in Australia. The organisation folded within the year because men's softball could not compete for participation with other popular Australian sports like Australian rules football, rugby league, cricket and baseball. The popularity of softball for men started happening in the late 1970s. In 1994, estimates put male participation in the sport at fifty-thousand regular competitors. Men's world championships were first held in Mexico City in 1966 and have been held every four years since. Australia did not send a team to this competition. Australia has never hosted the men's championships, nor won it or been runners up. Australia's men competed at the 1988 Men's Softball World Series, the first Softball World Series for men.

It is used mainly for dairying and particularly for cheesemaking. History The name Montb√©liarde was first used by Joseph Graber in 1872, when exhibiting a group of cattle at the Langres agricultural competition.Organisation for the Selection of the Montb√©liarde Breed Before this the local stock from indigenous multipurpose breeds such as F√©meline and Tourache (later known as Comtoise) had been improved by Mennonite farmers from Switzerland, and named Franco-Swiss. In 1889, the breed was accepted officially, and a stud book was founded. Since 1980, the breed has been selected for good roughage conversion. After 1900, many cattle were sold to the Midi region and Algeria. In the 1970s, Red Holstein was crossed into the breed. At the same time, they sporadically crossed with Fleckvieh bulls, but this was not very successful. In the 1990s, Montb√©liarde cattle were used for crossing into the Danish Red cattle and Vorderwalder Cattle breeds. Characteristics thumb The animals are red pied with white heads and short horns, and of dairy type.

Uses Montb√©liarde cattle are mainly a dairy breed, but have better beef characteristics than Holstein cattle. Nearly 400,000 milk recorded Montb√©liarde cows are in France with an average adult lactation of 7,486 litres (1,647 imperial gallons; 1,978 liquid gallons) at 3.9% butterfat and 3.45% protein.Montb√©liarde UK The milk protein is of a type well suited to cheesemaking, and some herds are fed a hay-based diet to produce milk specifically for this purpose. Cull cows and bull calves are worth more than Holsteins. The breed has spread to many countries and is becoming popular for crossing with Holsteins to give improved longevity and fertility.

History The 1991 diagram of the proposed LGV network already included the LGV Normandie. This was to begin in the Parisian suburbs and would split into two branches near Mantes-la-Jolie; one leading towards Rouen, the other ending near √âvreux. This project was abandoned due to profitability concerns (the cost of replacing the current Corails with TGVs would be high, whereas the time gain would be modest). The Basse-Normandie and Haute- Normandie regions would therefore have to content themselves with a more basic project improving the infrastructure of the \\"classic\\" line. Current project The current LGV Normandie project, which followed several years later, is more ambitious than the foregoing: * In addition to the Paris- Normandy route, it provides for internal links inside Normandy (TER-GV) and intra-provincial connections * The project connects to the three principal cities of Normandy: Rouen, Caen and Le Havre are linked to Paris entirely by LGV This \\"new\\" version of the LGV Normandie would begin in the Parisian suburb of Nanterre, on the regular Paris-Poissy line. A connection is foreseen in order to serve La D√©fense from Normandy. The line would then follow in large part the A14 and A13 motorways until Oissel, south of Rouen, where two links towards Rouen and perhaps a new station would be constructed. The line would then follow the left bank of the river Seine until a triangle junction situated east of Honfleur; from here a line would cross the Seine between Normandy and Tancarville bridges, ending in a link which would enable service to Le Havre. After Honfleur junction, the LGV would border the sea and a connection would serve Deauville. The LGV would end in Cagny, near Caen, enabling TGVs to serve Caen but not Cherbourg. The line would therefore permit the linking of Rouen and Paris in 30 minutes, Le Havre and Paris in 50 minutes, and Caen to Paris in less than an hour. Additionally it would enable high-speed connections between Caen-Rouen, Caen-Le Havre and Rouen-Le Havre.

The parish has a population of 502. History The parish of Dunkerton was part of the Wellow Hundred. It was called Duncretone in the Domesday Survey, and had earlier been held by a thegn named Alwold \\"the bald\\" in the reign of Edward the Confessor, who was possibly Alwold of Stevington. After the conquest it was granted along with other fiefs to a tenant called Turstin FitzRolf, also known as Tosteins Fitz- Rou and ‚Äúle Blanc‚Äù of the Bec-en-Caux region of Normandy, who was described as a valiant warrior at the Battle of Hastings. In the 18th and 19th century Dunkerton was surrounded by several coal mines on the Somerset coalfield. Evidence remains in the powderhouse, which dates from 1870 and is a Grade II listed building. The mine was the site of riots in 1908‚Äì09 about the working conditions in the Dunkerton Pit. Parts of the Ealing comedy The Titfield Thunderbolt were filmed at the disused Dunkerton Colliery. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The parish falls within the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the Great Western Ambulance Service. Bath and North East Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in Bath. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Wansdyke district and the City of Bath of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Bathavon Rural District. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of North East Somerset. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. It was also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.

It concerned the jurisdiction of Magistrates or Sessions Judges to try charges against European British subjects if they were themselves not European. The Graphic, 16 June 1883, p. 605: \\"The Native Agitation in India ‚Äì A Meeting in the Town Hall, Bombay, in Support of Mr. Ilbert's Criminal Jurisdiction Bill\\". It is named after Courtenay Ilbert, who had proposed it as a compromise between two previously suggested bills. However, the introduction of the bill led to intense opposition in Britain and from British settlers in India that ultimately played on racial tension before it was enacted in 1884 in a severely compromised state. The bitter controversy deepened antagonism between the British and Indians and was a prelude to the formation of the Indian National Congress in the next two years. Controversy Courtenay Ilbert drafted the \\"Bill to amend the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1882, so far as it relates to the exercise of jurisdiction over European British subjects\\", which subsequently became known as the Ilbert bill. On 2 February 1883 he moved for leave to introduce the bill and it was formally introduced on 9 February 1883. The most vocal opponents of the bill were British tea and indigo plantations owners in Bengal, led by Griffith Evans. Rumours began circulating that an English female was raped by an Indian in Calcutta. In reference to the Indian Rebellion of 1857, when it was alleged that English women and girls were raped by Indian sepoys, many British colonialists expressed great concern over the humiliation that English females would have to face appearing before Indian judges in the case of rape. The British press in India spread wild rumours about how Indian judges would abuse their power to fill their harems with white English females. The propaganda that Indian judges could not be trusted in dealing with cases involving English females helped raise considerable support against the bill. John Beames, a long serving civil servant in India, stated \\"It is intensely distasteful and humiliating to all Europeans...it will tend seriously to impair the prestige of British rule in India...it conceals the elements of revolution which may ere long prove the ruin of the country\\". English women who opposed the bill further argued that Bengali women, who they stereotyped as \\"ignorant\\", are neglected by their men, and that Bengali babu should therefore not be given the right to judge cases involving English women. Bengali women who supported the bill responded by claiming that they were more educated than the English women opposed to the bill, and pointed out that more Indian women had academic degrees than British women did at the time, alluding to the fact that the University of Calcutta became one of the first universities to admit female graduates to its degree programmes in 1878, before any of the British universities had done the same. Resolution At first, as a result of popular disapproval of the Ilbert Bill by a majority of English women, Viceroy Ripon (who had introduced the Bill) passed an amendment, whereby a jury of 50% Europeans was required if an Indian judge was to face a European on the dock. Finally, a solution was adopted by way of compromise: jurisdiction to try Europeans would be conferred on European and Indian District Magistrates and Sessions Judges alike. However, a defendant would in all cases have the right to claim trial by a jury of which at least half the members must be European. The bill was then passed on 25 January 1884 as the Criminal Procedure Code Amendment Act 1884, coming into force on 1 May of that year.

These reflexes are suppressed by the development of the frontal lobes as a child transitions normally into child development. These primitive reflexes are also called infantile, infant or newborn reflexes. Older children and adults with atypical neurology (e.g., people with cerebral palsy) may retain these reflexes and primitive reflexes may reappear in adults. Reappearance may be attributed to certain neurological conditions including dementia (especially in a rare set of diseases called frontotemporal degenerations), traumatic lesions, and strokes. An individual with cerebral palsy and typical intelligence can learn to suppress these reflexes, but the reflex might resurface under certain conditions (i.e., during extreme startle reaction). Reflexes may also be limited to those areas affected by the atypical neurology, (i.e., individuals with cerebral palsy that only affects their legs retaining the Babinski reflex but having normal speech); for those individuals with hemiplegia, the reflex may be seen in the foot on the affected side only. Primitive reflexes are primarily tested with suspected brain injury or some dementias such as Parkinson's disease for the purpose of assessing frontal lobe functioning. If they are not being suppressed properly they are called frontal release signs. Atypical primitive reflexes are also being researched as potential early warning signs of autistic spectrum disorders. Primitive reflexes are mediated by extrapyramidal functions, many of which are already present at birth. They are lost as the pyramidal tracts gain functionality with progressive myelination. They may reappear in adults or children with loss of function of the pyramidal system due to a variety of reasons. However, with the advent of Amiel Tison method of neurological assessment, the importance of assessment of such reflexes in the pediatric population has come down.Amiel-Tison C, Grenier A. Neurological Assessment during first year of life. New York. Oxford University Press, 1986; 46-94. Adaptive value of reflexes Reflexes vary in utility. Some reflexes hold a survival value (e.g., the rooting reflex, which helps a breastfed infant find the mother's nipple). Babies display the rooting reflex only when they are hungry and touched by another person, not when they touch themselves. There are a few reflexes that likely assisted in the survival of babies during human evolutionary past (e.g., the Moro reflex). Other reflexes such as sucking and grabbing help establish gratifying interaction between parents and infants. They can encourage a parent to respond with love and affection, and to feed their child more competently. In addition, it helps parents to comfort their infant while allowing the baby to control distress and the amount of stimulation they receive.Berk, Laura E.. Child Development. 8th. USA: Pearson, 2009. Sucking reflex The sucking reflex is common to all mammals and is present at birth. It is linked with the rooting reflex and breastfeeding. It causes the child to instinctively suck anything that touches the roof of their mouth and simulates the way a child naturally eats. There are two stages of the action: #Expression: activated when the nipple is placed between a child's lips and touches their palate. They will instinctively press it between their tongue and palate to draw out the milk. #Milking: The tongue moves from areola to nipple, coaxing milk from the mother to be swallowed by the child. Rooting reflex The rooting reflex is present at birth (age of appearance 28 weeks) and disappears around four months of age, as it gradually comes under voluntary control. The rooting reflex assists in the act of breastfeeding. A newborn infant will turn its head toward anything that strokes its cheek or mouth, searching for the object by moving its head in steadily decreasing arcs until the object is found. After becoming familiar to responding in this way (if breastfed, approximately three weeks after birth), the infant will move directly to the object without searching.Odent M. The early expression of the rooting reflex. Proceedings of the 5th International Congress of Psychosomatic Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Rome 1977. London: Academic Press, 1977: 1117-19. Moro reflex The Moro reflex in a four-day- old infant: 1) the reflex is initiated by pulling the infant up from the floor and then releasing him ; 2) he spreads his arms 3) he pulls his arms in ; 4) he cries (10 seconds) The Moro reflex is an important indicator for evaluating integration of the central nervous system, named after its discoverer, pediatrician Ernst Moro. Although this is sometimes referred to as the startle reaction, startle response, startle reflex or embrace reflex, most researchers see it as distinct from the startle reflex, and is believed to be the only unlearned fear in human newborns. The Moro reflex is present at birth, peaks in the first month of life, and begins to integrate around 2 months of age. It is likely to occur if the infant's head suddenly shifts position, the temperature changes abruptly, or they are startled by a sudden noise. The legs and head extend while the arms jerk up and out with the palms up and thumbs flexed. Shortly afterward the arms are brought together and the hands clench into fists, and the infant cries loudly. The reflex normally integrates by three to four months of age, though it may last up to six months. Bilateral absence of the reflex may be linked to damage to the infant's central nervous system, while a unilateral absence could mean an injury due to birth trauma (e.g., a fractured clavicle or injury to the brachial plexus). Erb's palsy or some other form of paralysis is also sometimes present in such cases. In human evolutionary history, the Moro reflex may have helped infants cling to the mother while being carried around. If the infant lost its balance, the reflex caused the infant to embrace its mother and regain its hold on the mother's body. Walking/stepping reflex The walking or stepping reflex is present at birth, though infants this young cannot support their own weight. When the soles of their feet touch a flat surface they will attempt to walk by placing one foot in front of the other. This reflex integrates around 5‚Äì6 months as infants start attempting to walk after this reflex disappears. Asymmetrical tonic neck reflex (ATNR) The asymmetrical tonic neck reflex (ATNR) in a two- week-old female, with extension of the left extremities and flexion of the right. The asymmetrical tonic neck reflex, also known as 'fencing posture', is present at one month of age and integrates at around four months. When the child's head is turned to the side, the arm on that side will straighten and the opposite arm will bend (sometimes the motion will be very subtle or slight). If the infant is unable to move out of this position or the reflex continues to be triggered past six months of age, the child may have a disorder of the upper motor neurons. According to researchers, the tonic neck reflex is a precursor to the hand/eye coordination of the infant. It also prepares the infant for voluntary reaching. Symmetrical tonic neck reflex The symmetric tonic neck reflex normally appears and develops around 6‚Äì9 months of age and should integrate by around 12 months. When the child's head flexes forward, extending the back of the neck, the upper extremities will contract and the lower extremities will extend. Conversely, when the child's head is extended backward, contracting the back of the neck, the upper extremities will extend and the lower extremities will contract. This reflex is important to help a child push up onto their hands and knees but may inhibit actual forward creeping or crawling if it is not properly integrated. If this reflex is retained beyond 2‚Äì3 years, it may result, directly or indirectly, in a range of physical and neurological developmental delays. Tonic labyrinthine reflex The tonic labyrinthine reflex is a primitive reflex found in newborn humans. With this reflex, tilting the head back while lying on the back causes the back to stiffen and even arch backwards, the legs to straighten, stiffen, and push together, the toes to point, the arms to bend at the elbows and wrists, and the hands to become fisted or the fingers to curl. The presence of this reflex beyond the newborn stage is also referred to as abnormal extension pattern or extensor tone. The presence of the TLR as well as other primitive reflexes such as the asymmetrical tonic neck reflex (ATNR) beyond the first six months of life may indicate that the child has developmental delays and/or neurological abnormalities. For example, in people with cerebral palsy, the reflexes may persist and even be more pronounced. As abnormal reflexes, both the tonic labyrinthine reflex and the asymmetrical tonic neck reflex can cause problems for the growing child. The TLR and ATNR both hinder functional activities such as rolling, bringing the hands together, or even bringing the hands to the mouth. Over time, both the TLR and ATNR can cause serious damage to the growing child's joints and bones, causing the head of the femur to partially slip out of the acetabulum (subluxation) or completely move out of the acetabulum (dislocation). Palmar grasp reflex Grasp reflex of a 5 month old baby The palmar grasp reflex appears at birth and persists until five or six months of age. When an object is placed in the infant's hand and strokes their palm, the fingers will close and they will grasp it with a palmar grasp. To best observe this reflex, on a bed where the child could safely fall onto a pillow, offer the infant two opposing little fingers (as index fingers are typically too large for the infant to grasp), and gradually lift. The grasp of it may be able to support the child's weight, they may also release their grip suddenly and without warning. The reverse motion can be induced by stroking the back or side of the hand. Plantar reflex A plantar reflex is a normal reflex that involves plantar flexion of the foot, which moves toes away from the shin and curls them down. An abnormal plantar reflex (Babinski sign) occurs when upper motor neuron control over the flexion reflex circuit is interrupted. This results in a dorsiflexion of the foot (foot angles towards the shin, big toe curls up). This also occurs in babies under c. 1 year, because of low myelination of the corticospinal tracts. As these tracts develop to adult form, the flexion-reflex circuit is inhibited by the descending corticospinal inputs, and the normal plantar reflex develops.Khwaja, JIACM 2005; 6(3): 193-7: \\"Plantar Reflex\\" The Babinski reflex is a sign of neurological abnormality (e.g., upper motor neuron lesion) in adults. Galant reflex The Galant reflex, also known as Galant's infantile reflex, is present at birth and fades between the ages of four to six months. When the skin along the side of an infant's back is stroked, the infant will swing towards the side that was stroked. If the reflex persists past six months of age, it is a sign of pathology. The reflex is named after the Russian neurologist Johann Susman Galant. Swimming reflex The swimming reflex involves placing an infant face down in a pool of water. The infant will begin to paddle and kick in a swimming motion. The reflex disappears between 4‚Äì6 months. Despite the infant displaying a normal response by paddling and kicking, placing them in water can be a very risky procedure. Infants can swallow a large amount of water while performing this task, therefore caregivers should proceed with caution. It is advisable to postpone swimming lessons for infants until they are at least three months old because infants submerged in water can die from water intoxication. Babkin reflex An infant demonstrating the Babkin reflex: he opens his mouth when pressure is applied to both palms (8 seconds). The Babkin reflex occurs in newborn babies, and describes varying responses to the application of pressure to both palms. Infants may display head flexion, head rotation, opening of the mouth, or a combination of these responses. Smaller, premature infants are more susceptible to the reflex, with an observed occurrence in a child of 26 weeks gestation. It is named after the Russian physiologist, Boris Babkin. Parachute reflex This reflex occurs in slightly older infants (starts between 6 and 7 monthscasemed.edu. and become fully mature by 1 year of age) when the child is held upright and the baby's body is rotated quickly to face forward (as in falling). The baby will extend their arms forward as if to break a fall, even though this reflex appears long before the baby walks. Unintegrated reflexes Reflexes that aren't suppressed in infancy are referred to as unintegrated or persistent reflexes. When they persist, they are related to academic struggles. For example, children with learning difficulties have been found to exhibit persistent primitive reflexes. In addition, a persistent ATNR has been found to be associated with lower reading and spelling scores, and children with reading problems tend to display the Tonic labyrinthine reflex more than children without reading problems. Lastly, a relationship has been found between ADHD symptoms and ATNR persistence and another between ADHD diagnosis and Moro and Galant reflex persistence. Other primitive reflexes tested in adults As mentioned in the introduction, when primitive reflexes are not being suppressed properly they are generally referred to as frontal release signs (although this may be a misnomer). In addition to the reflexes previously mentioned, they include the palmomental reflex, snout reflex, glabellar reflex or \\"tap\\" reflex. Primitive reflexes in high-risk newborns The term high-risk newborns refers to neonates with a significant chance of mortality or morbidity, especially within the first month of being born. High-risk newborns will often show abnormal responses of primitive reflexes, or lack a response entirely. Performance of primitive reflexes in high-risk newborns will often vary in response depending on the reflex (e.g., normal Moro reflex may be present, while the walking reflex is absent or abnormal). Normal performance of primitive reflexes in newborns can be linked to a greater likelihood of having higher Apgar scores, higher birth weight, shorter hospitalization time after birth, and a better overall mental state. A recent cross-sectional study assessing primitive reflexes in 67 high- risk newborns, used a sample method to evaluate responses of the sucking, Babinski and Moro reflexes. The results of the study showed that the sucking reflex was performed normally most often (63.5%), followed by the Babinski reflex (58.7%), and the Moro reflex (42.9%). The study concluded that high- risk newborns presented more periodic abnormal and absent responses of primitive reflexes, and that each reflex varied in response. However, with the advent of simple and effective methods like the Amiel Tison method of neurological assessment, as predictor of neurological sequele in high-risk neonates and infants, the importance of assessment of primitive reflexes is decreasing.

The chapter house with library and dovecote above, of the former Carthusian Hinton Priory dates from 1232 and is a Grade I listed building. The priory was founded in 1232 by Ela, Countess of Salisbury, who also founded Lacock Abbey. Hinton House was built around 1700. It is a Grade II* listed building. In 1895 a Titt iron wind engine was installed to pump water from a spring by Bath Union Rural District Council. During the Second World War, GHQ Line ran just to the north of Hinton Charterhouse. At (Hedge) Hog Wood remains of an anti-tank ditch and other trenchworks can still be seen. These rare survivors as well as rather more robust pillboxes were constructed as a part of British anti-invasion preparations.Foot, 2006, pp 283-288. The Grade II listed former village school is now a private residence. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The parish falls within the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the Great Western Ambulance Service. Bath and North East Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in Bath. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Wansdyke district and the City of Bath of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Bathavon Rural District. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of North East Somerset.

Asphalt/aggregate operations are managed by Veidekke Industry AS. This segment includes production of asphalt and asphalting work, production of gravel and crushed stone, as well as maintenance of public roads.  History  Veidekke's roots go back to 1863 in Denmark (H. Hoffmann & S√∏nner) and in 1896 in Norway (H√∏yer Ellefsen). As a company, Veidekke was founded 6 February 1936 by Nico S. Beer and Gustav Piene. In its founding years, Veidekke was a company constructing roads and laying cobblestone. When the Second World War broke out in 1940, the company fulfilled all signed contracts and shut down all operations until after the war. In 1948, the small and virtually unknown company, Veidekke, won the contract for construction of runways at Stavanger Airport, Sola. This was the first of a number of major airport contracts for Veidekke. In the middle of the 1950s, Veidekke was engaged in airport construction in Ethiopia. This was a very important contract for the future development of the company. In the 1960s the company's main activity was road construction. From 1969 until the beginning of the 1980s, Veidekke was once again active in Africa, this time performing various contracts for NORAD (the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation). The beginning of the 1970s was also the beginning of a new period for Veidekke. The company needed to focus on new product areas. In 1972, Veidekke was awarded the contract for construction of the Heggmoen Dam in Northern Norway, and what followed for Veidekke, was a period of nationwide dam construction. At the beginning of the 1980s, a structural development of the building and construction industry started in Norway. This resulted in the amalgamation of many companies into a few major players. Veidekke, however, decided on a different course, choosing instead to develop itself into a nationwide contracting company. Consequently, through take-overs, mergers and establishment of new companies, more than 60 companies have become part of Veidekke. Veidekke has grown from being the ninth largest construction company at the beginning of the 1980s to its present position as the largest Norwegian owned construction company. On June 23, 1986 Veidekke was quoted on the Oslo Stock Exchange's main list. Since the end of the 1960s Veidekke's employees have owned shares in the company, and Veidekke still encourages its employees to buy shares through well renowned share programs.

Chanda Sahib (died 12 June 1752) was a subject of the Mughal Empire and the Nawab of the Carnatic between 1749 and 1752. Initially he was supported by the French during the Carnatic Wars. After his defeat at Arcot in 1751, he was captured by the Marathas of Thanjavur and executed. He was the son-in-law of the Nawab of Carnatic Dost Ali Khan, under whom he worked as a Dewan. Chanda Sahib, an ally of the French, annexed the Madurai Nayaks and was declared the \\"Nawab\\", bringing Tanjore and Tinnevelly into the dominions of the Mughal Empire. He was weakened by constant Maratha attacks and was defeated by Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah. After his forces were defeated by Robert Clive and the Maratha Empire, he attempted to recoup his losses but was beheaded in a mutiny by Hindu subjects in the Tanjore army.Brittlebank, p. 22Dodwell, H. H. (ed), Cambridge History of India, Vol. v. Early life His birth name was Husayn Dost Khan. Chanda Sahib sought the investiture of the Mughal Emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur by declaring himself \\"Nawab of Tinnevelly\\" and gathered his own army of 3500 men and even received 400 French infantry from Dupleix. Subduing Madurai Vijaya Ranga Chokkanatha died in 1731, and was succeeded by his widow Meenakshi, who acted as Queen-Regent on behalf of a young boy she had adopted as the heir of her dead husband. She had only ruled a year or two when an insurrection was raised against her by Vangaru Thirumala, the father of her adopted son, who pretended to have claims of his own to the throne of Madurai. At this juncture representatives of the Mughals appeared on the scene and took an important part in the struggle. Since 1693, Madurai nominally had been the feudatory of the emperor of Delhi, and since 1698 the Carnatic region north of the Coleroon (Kollidam) river had been under direct Muslim rule. The local representative of the Mughal was the Nawab of Arcot, Dost Ali Khan and an intermediate authority was held by the Nizam of Hyderabad, who was in theory both a subordinate of the emperor, and the superior of the Nawab. How regularly the kings of Tanjore and Madurai paid their tribute is not clear, but in 1734 ‚Äî about the time, in fact, that Meenakshi and Vangaru Tirumala were fighting for the crown ‚Äî an expedition was sent by the then Nawab of Arcot to exact tribute and submission from the kingdoms of the south. The leaders of this expedition were the Nawab Dost Ali khan's son, Safdar Ali Khan, and his nephew and confidential adviser, the well-known Chanda Sahib. The invaders took Tanjore by storm and, leaving the stronghold of Trichinopoly untouched, swept across Madurai and Tinnevelly and into Travancore. On their return from this expedition they took part in the quarrel between Meenakshi and Vangaru Tirumala. The latter approached Safdar Ali Khan with an offer of 30,000 gold and silver coins if he would oust the Meenakshi in favour of himself. Unwilling to attack Trichinopoly, the Muslim prince contented himself with solemnly declaring Vangaru Tirumala to be king and took 30,000 gold and silver coins. He then marched away, leaving Chanda Sahib to enforce his award as best he could. Meenakshi, was immediately alarmed at the turn affairs now had taken, had little difficulty in persuading that facile politician to accept her tribute of 100,000 silver and gold coins and declared her duly entitled to the throne. Meenakshi required Chanda Sahib to swear on the Quran that he would adhere faithfully to his engagement. He was honorably admitted into the Trichinopoly fort and Vangaru Tirumala ‚Äî apparently with the good will of the queen, who, did not seem to have wished him any harm and allowed him to venture into Madurai, to rule over that region and Tinnevelly. Career Carnatic containing the territory of Tanjore ruled by the Nawab of the Carnatic, Chanda Sahib. Chanda Sahib accepted a large tributes for protection and departed to Arcot. Two years later 1736 he returned, again was admitted into the Trichinopoly fort, and proceeded to instate himself the Nawab of the Carnatic and received recognition by the Mughal Emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur. Chanda Sahib eventually marched against Vangaru Tirumala, who still was ruling in the south, defeated him at Ammaya Nayakkanur and Dindigul, drove him to take refuge in Sivaganga, and occupied the southern provinces of the Madurai Nayak. For a time, Chanda Sahib had his own way. His success was regarded with suspicion and even hostility by the Nawab of Arcot. But family loyalties prevented a rupture and Chanda Sahib was left undisturbed, while he strengthened the fortifications of Trichinopoly and appointed his two brothers as governors of the strongholds of Dindigul and Madurai. It was at this period that he subjugated the king of Tanjore, although he did not annex his territory, and he compelled them to cede Karaikal to the French. On 14 February 1739, Karaikal became a French colony. =Maratha interlude (1740‚Äî1743)= Unable to help themselves against the Europeans and the subjects of the Great Mogul, the king of Tanjore and Vangaru Tirumala called for the assistance of the Marathas of Satara in Maharashtra. These Maratha of the Carnatic had their own grievance against the Muslims of Arcot, with whom Chanda Sahib still was identified, because of long-delayed payment of the chouth, or one-fourth of their revenues, which they had promised in return for the withdrawal of the Marathas from their country and the discontinuation of their incursions. These Marathas of Tanjore also were encouraged to attempt reprisals by the Nizam of Hyderabad, who ‚Äî jealous of the increasing power of the Nawab and careless of the loyalty due to co-religionists ‚Äî gladly would have seen his dangerous subordinate brought to the ground. Early in 1740, therefore, the Marathas appeared in the south with a vast army, and defeated and killed the Nawab of Arcot (Dost Ali Khan) in the pass of Damalcheruvu, now in Chittoor district. Then they came to an understanding with his son, the Safdar Ali Khan, recognised him as Nawab, in return, Khan accepted Maratha suzerainty and undertook to pay Marathas, an indemnity of 40 lakh rupees and a regular Chauth. With the Nawab of Arcot greatly weakened and Chanda Sahib was captured and imprisoned by the Marathas in the siege of Tiruchirappalli (1741) led by general Raghuji Bhonsle under the orders of Chhattrapati Shahu. In 1741, the Travancore-Dutch War had broken out, during the course of the conflict it was the policy of the subjects of the Great Mogul to support European mercantile presence in the Indian subcontinent. Nawab of the Carnatic =The Second Carnatic War (1749-1754)= After the death of the Nizam of Hyderabad, a civil war for succession broke out in south between Nasir Jung and Muzaffar Jung. Also, Chanda Sahib began to conspire against the Nawab Anwaruddin Muhammed Khan in Carnatic. This led to the Second Carnatic War. =Defeat at Arcot= Clive at the siege of Arcot (1751) In 1751, there was an ongoing scuffle between Mohamed Ali Khan Walajan, (who was the son of the previous Nawab of Arcot, Anwaruddin Muhammed Khan and hence the rightful claimant) and Chanda Sahib. Dupleix sided with Chanda sahib and Muzaffar Jung to bring them into power in their respective states. But soon the English intervened. To offset the French influence, they began supporting Nasir Jung and Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah. Chanda Sahib initially succeeded and became the Nawab, forcing Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah to escape to the rock-fort in Tiruchirapalli. =Defeat at Trichinopoly= Chanda Sahib followed and with the help of the French, led the siege of Tiruchirappalli (1751‚Äì1752). Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah and the English force supporting him were in a grim position. A small English force of 300 soldiers made a diversionary attack on Arcot to draw away Chanda Sahib's army from Trichy. Chanda Sahib dispatched a 10,000 strong force under his son Raza Sahib to retake Arcot. Raza Sahib was aided by the Nellore Army and Muhammed Yusuf Khan as a Subedar may have been in this force. There he was defeated by English forces, that mostly enlisted Indians. Death At Arcot, and later at Kaveripakkam (Coillady), Chanda Sahib's son was defeated and later killed by the British. Following this Chanda Sahib escaped to what was probably his hometown at Tanjore, only to be captured by the \\"Maratha army of Tanjore\\". He was beheaded by the Maratha Tanjore Raja named Pratap Singh of Thanjavur. The English quickly installed Muhammed Ali as the Nawab of Arcot in 1754 and most of Chanda Sahib's native forces defected to the English.

He was born in 1657 CE. and held several appointments under Emperor Aurangzeb in the Mughal Empire. He was married to the daughter of Shaista Khan (the son of Asaf Khan). Services in the Mughal Army =Capture of Raigarh= Muhammad Ismail was with the Emperor during the 30-year-long Deccan Wars with the Sultanates of Golconda and Bijapur and the Marathas. He was sent by the emperor against the Maratha stronghold of Raigarh against Raja Ram Bhonsle. But the widow of Sambhaji, Yesubai and her minister Ramchandra Bavdekar Pant Amatya sent young Raja Ram Bhonsle to the stronghold of Pratapgarh through Kavlya ghat from where he escaped to the fort of Jinji in present-day state of Tamil Nadu arriving on 1 November 1689. Muhammad Ismail was given the title Itikad Khan and sent along with the naval commander Siddi Qasim Yaqut Khan besieged Raigarh in March 1689 till 19 October 1689 when Yesubai and her minister Ramchandra Bavdekar Pant Amatya surrendered on the promise that Itikad Khan swear on the Quran that he would protect her and Shahu II against any cruelty. On the capture of Raigarh all that remained of Shivaji's treasure, all the records of the Maratha government, the royal horses and elephants with their state trappings, and the golden throne made by the great king for his coronation, fell into Itikad Khan's hands. As a reward for this splendid success Itikad Khan was given the title of Zulfiqar Khan and ordered to reduce Panhala Fort. Siddi Qasim Yaqut Khan was rewarded by the grant of the Ratnagiri districts of Anjanvel and Sindhudurg. =Siege of Jinji and Governorship of Hyderabad-Karnataka= The Maratha commandant of Panhala Fort was Ghatge of Kagal. He surrendered to Zulfiqar Khan in April 1690. Zulfiqar Khan was now sent on the most enduring task of his and the Mughal Empire's legacy in South India, to besiege Jinji Fort. In the first siege of the fort from 1690-1695 CE. he along with his father Asad Khan and Prince Muhammad Kam Bakhsh failed to capture the fort. Disagreement with the young prince and the mutiny of the Mughal artillery were the reasons for the failure of the siege on top of the Maratha insurgency. Zulfiqar Khan settled the matter with an armistice and moved some troops to Madras with himself moving to Vandavasi. There he found refuge and a new ally in the British East India Company. Fort St. George's Governor Elihu Yale (the founder of Yale University in the United States), helped in all possible ways in return obtains a kaul from Vizier Asad Khan confirming the existing grants for the factories of Madras, Masulipatnam, Madapollam, Vizagapatam, Fort St. David, Cuddalore, and Porto Novo and making new grants of Egmore, Purasawalkam and Tondiarpet. But when Zulfiqar Khan requested 100,000 pagodas from the Madras Council, Nathaniel Higginson (first Mayor of Madras) sent a present, but declined to lend the sum asked. An attack on Madras is feared by the English from Zulfiqar Khan but Emperor Aurangzeb sends Zulfiqar Khan reinforcements and commands him to renew the siege of Jinji without further delay and not to waste time with the English. When Qasim Khan, Subedar of Bijapur-Karnatak was bringing supplies to Vandavasi he was intercepted by Santa Ghorpade near Kaveripakkam. Qasim Khan took shelter behind its walls. Zulfiqar Khan, hearing of his straits, marched to his relief and escorted him safely to Vandavasi. Santa baulked of his prey, attacked and took a number of forts with their Mughal garrisons, Zulfiqar Khan at once turned back, retook the forts and entering Thanjavur took from Shahu, Vyanko's son, a large indemnity. Returning northwards, he led out his army from Vandavasi and renewed the siege of Jinji. Unable to cope with Zulfiqar Khan's military skill and the large forces at his disposal, Santa Ghorpade entered the southern province of Bijapur. The second siege of Jinji Fort began in 1695 and lasted till 1698 CE. Santa Ghorpade while in Bijapur had defeated Qasim Khan and Himmat Khan and was tempted to try once more to relieve Jinji, but Zulfiqar Khan went out in person to meet him and severely defeated him some miles to the north of Jinji. Santa realized that with Zulfiqar Khan in sole command of the investing army, it was impossible to raise the siege. By 1697 it had become a blockade and little blood was shed save when Zulfiqar Khan's second in command, Daud Khan Panni, from time to time got drunk and senselessly assaulted the Maratha outposts. Nevertheless, the blockade was a strict one and no supplies entered the beleaguered town. Raja Ram Bhonsle realized he could no longer hold out and escaped one night to Vellore. Harji Mahadik's son took command of the garrison. But the vigor of Zulfiqar Khan's attacks soon afterwards carried the outer walls. In January 1698, Daud Khan came by chance to learn of a path through a small wood up the side of the fortress. Sober for the moment, he examined it and without informing Zulfiqar Khan, decided to storm it. He joined with him in the enterprise a Rajput chief called Rao Dalpat Bundela. The garrison thought the assault to be only one of Daud Khan Panni's drunken outbreaks and paid little heed to it, until Dalpat Rao had carried the main defenses. The garrison fled to the citadel. But the Mughal forces now entered the town on all sides and the citadel surrendered to Zulfiqar Khan. As he had previously promised to do, he handed over Raja Ram's wives and their two sons to the Shirkes, who arranged for their return to the western Deccan. So ended the great siege of Jinji in January 1698. The escape of Raja Ram from Jinji angered Emperor Alamgir who now determined to crush the Marathas began to lay sieges of various Maratha forts from 1698 onwards. But for Zulfiqar Khan's successes and his continued resolve and determination in holding onto Eastern Deccan, Emperor Aurangzeb gave him the added title of Nusrat Jung. =Battle of Godavari River= The Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb leads his final expedition (1705). Raja Ram had taken with him a large force to attack Jalna. His march was at first successful. He plundered the city and then set it on fire. Entering the Godavari valley, he plundered Paithan, Bhid and other towns along the river banks. Fearing to penetrate further east he turned back, meaning to deposit his plunder within the walls of Sinhagarh. He had no sooner turned than he was surprised and defeated by Zulfiqar Khan. Zulfiqar Khan had in a series of skillfully fought actions worsted repeatedly Dhanaji Jadhav and had driven the Maratha troops out of south-eastern India. He then hastened north-west and inflicted on Raja Ram's army, a severe reverse. The regent fell back with all speed, but he never shook off the Mughal pursuit. In this disastrous retreat the regent's resource and courage alone saved his army. Although half dead with fatigue, he fought for fifty miles a continuous series of rear-guard actions, and at last brought his command, reduced but not destroyed, to the welcome shelter of Sinhagad. Unhappily, the hardships and exposure aggravated a weakness of Raja Ram's lungs contracted at Jinji, He at first seemed in good spirits at the fortunate end of his enterprise, received modestly the congratulations of Ramchandra Bavdekar and the other ministers. But after some days high fever set in with frequent hemorrhages. Raja Ram died of an unspecified illness in 1700 at fort Sinhagad in present-day Maharashtra. Thereafter the Marathas suffered a power vacuum until the release of his nephew, Shahu II in 1707. In the interim, Raja Ram's wife, Tara Bai ruled the empire as regent for her young son, Shiva II. Eventually, Shahu II son of Sambhaji succeeded Raja Ram in 1708 after a civil war. =Siege of Wagingera= During the final Siege of Wagingera Emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir sent for Zulfiqar Khan Nusrat Jung who arrived on 27 March, and next day attacked Lal Tikri hillock which was lost to the Berads in the early days of the siege and retook it. The Berads retreated to the village at the foot of Talwargera and began firing their muskets from behind its mud wall. Many Rajputs fell in this daring attack. But Zulfiqar Khan Nusrat Jung did not stop there. He sent Rao Dalpat Bundela to another mound which was taken and the Berads fled to the village of Dhedpura. On this day, 21 bullets and 1 rocket hit Rao Dalpat Bundela's elephant while the banners of Zulfiqar Khan Nusrat Jung were full of shot holes from the Berad musket fire. But Zulfiqar Khan Nusrat Jung held his position. A few days afterwards Zulfiqar Khan Nusrat Jung made a strategic move and captured the wells from where the Berads used to draw their water. He attacked Talwargera on 27 April taking the village after slaughtering all the Berads. With the arrival of Zulfiqar Khan Nusrat Jung the Berads were now hard pressed. The siege weapons were pushed forward to the fort, and on the day appointed for the assault, Emperor Alamgir mounted his horse to take part therein, and took his position at a cannon-shot distance from the fort. The enemy was overpowered, and some positions were captured. Being greatly dispirited, Pedda Pidia Nayak, commander of the fort, placed two or three thousand musketeers to hold one of the gates to the last. He then directed his people to take their wives and children, their jewels, and whatever they could carry, and after setting fire to the temple and other buildings, they went out from another gate, and by some outlets which had been prepared for such an occasion, they made their way to the Maratha army, in parties, in the dark of night. They then fled with the Marathas. The conflagration in the fort and the cessation of the firing made the Mughals aware of their flight. A party of men entered, and found only disabled and wounded persons who were unable to fly. On the 14th Muharram, the Imperial forces took possession of the place after a siege of three months. The name Wagingera was changed to Fort Rahman Bakhsh. The Imperial army then retired to pass the rainy season at Deogaon, three or four kos from the River Krishna. A plaque embedded on the wall to the entrance of the fort reads in Persian; \\\\- signifying the fall of the fort in 1705. By now the elderly Emperor was exhausted and returned to Ahmednagar on 31 January 1706. The siege of Wagingera would be his last battle. He died in 1707 and was succeeded by his son Bahadur Shah I. Amir-ul-Umara of Mughal Empire & Governorship of Deccan Zulfiqar Khan Nusrat Jung was made Amir-ul-Umara or Noble of Nobles under the new regime along with the Subahdari of the government of Deccan and in Karnatak was placed his second in command Daud Khan Panni. Grand Vizier of Mughal Empire & Execution It was with Zulfiqar Khan's aid and intrigues that Jahandar Shah after the death of his father Bahadur Shah I, overcame all his brothers and ascended the throne of Delhi when he was appointed as Vizir- e-Azam or Prime Minister. Zulfiqar Khan was the first prime minister of the Mughal Empire to have more power in the government of the empire than any Emperor since the early years of the reign of Akbar.John F. Richards, The New Cambridge History of India: The Mughal Empire (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1993), p. 262 After the defeat of Jahandar Shah in the battle against Farrukhsiyar, he was taken up and strangled by order of the latter as a punishment for his conduct. His head together with that of the late emperor Jahandar Shah, were carried on poles and their bodies hanging feet upwards across an elephant were exposed in the new emperor's train when he made his triumphant entry to the palace at Delhi. This event took place in January 1713 CE. His aged father, Asad Khan, was compelled to attend the procession accompanied by the ladies of his family as spectators of their own disgrace. It was Asad Khan who in hopes of making peace with the new emperor had persuaded his son to visit him and had thus put him in his power. With tears in his eyes he wrote the following epitaph on his son's death: See also *Siege of Raigarh (1689) Sources See also *Nawabs of Arcot Category:Mughal nobility Category:Indian Muslims Category:Nawabs of the Carnatic Category:Mughal Empire Category:1657 births Category:1713 deaths Category:Grand Viziers of the Mughal Empire ","title":"Zulfiqar Khan Nusrat Jung"},{"id":"8030247","text":"United Nations Security Council resolution 1111, adopted unanimously on 4 June 1997, after recalling all previous resolutions on Iraq, including Resolution 986 (1995) which established the Oil-for-Food Programme, the Council, acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, extended the provisions of that resolution relating to Iraqi oil sales for a further 180 days to meet the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people.

Lymphomatoid means lymphoma-like and granulomatosis denotes the microscopic characteristic of the presence of granulomas with polymorphic lymphoid infiltrates and focal necrosis within it. LG most commonly affects middle aged people, but has occasionally been observed in young people. Males are found to be affected twice as often as females. Causes Lymphomatoid granulomatosis involves malignant B cells and reactive, non-malignant T cells and is almost always associated with infection of the malignant B cells by the Epstein-Barr virus; it is therefore considered to be a form of the Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases. The disease is believed to be induced by a combination of Epstein Barr virus infection and immunosuppression through immunosuppressive drugs (with case reports of methotrexate and azathioprine), infections such as HIV or chronic viral hepatitis or endogenous T cell defects. Pathophysiology The onset of the disease results in proliferation of EBV-infected malignant B-cells and a cytotoxic T-cell response which in turn leads to organ infiltration and dysfunction of the affected organs. The disease typically always relapse after successful treatment due to inability of the immune system and current viral drugs to eliminate an EBV-infection. If the onset of the disease can be linked to use of immunosuppressive drugs then discontinuation of these drugs may hinder a relapse. Organs usually affected are the skin, lungs, central nervous system while liver and kidney are affected to lesser extent. The pulmonary complications are usually what leads to death, however, CNS involvement that affects up to one third of the patients can be very severe with mental status changes, ataxia, hemiparesis, seizures, unconsciousness and death, typically followed in that order. The disease has been seen to transform to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and while LG is graded I-III based on the number of large EBV-positive B-cells, grade II and III can be considered as a variant of T-cell rich diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Treatment Treatment depends on the grade (I-III) but typically consist of cortisone, rituximab and chemotherapy (etoposide, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin). Methotrexate has been seen to induce LG. Interferon alpha has been used by the US National Cancer Institute with varying results. In recent years hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been performed on LG-patients with relative good success; a 2013 study identifying 10 cases found that 8 patients survived the treatment and were disease free several years later. Two of the disease free patients later died, one from suicide and one from graft versus host disease after a second transplantation 4 years later. The remaining two patients died from sepsis after the transplantation. Prognosis The current mortality is over 60% after 5 years. However, due to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation being performed only in recent years, this number could potentially be lowered in the future. In people with CNS involvement, treatment with Interferon alpha at the US National Cancer Institute resulted in complete remission in 90% of patients.

It lasted from 5 November 1993 until 31 January 2001 when it was superseded by the Strategic Rail Authority.  Main function  The Franchising Director's main function was to sell passenger rail franchises to private sector companies participating in the privatisation of the British railway industry. On 1 February 2001 the position of Franchising Director was abolished by the Transport Act 2000 and the passenger rail franchising functions were transferred to the newly created Strategic Rail Authority. The SRA was in turn abolished in 2006 and the SRA's franchising functions were taken over by the Secretary of State for Transport.  Holders of office  The first Franchising Director was Roger Salmon, a former investment banker. Salmon presided over the design of the franchising regime, but he resigned before the franchising programme began in earnest. Salmon was succeeded by John O'Brienhttps://heathrowrail.com/the-team/john-obrien/, who succeeded in selling 25 rail franchises in under two years (1995‚Äì97). The last franchise - ScotRail - was awarded only three weeks before the British general election of May 1997, in which the Labour government of Tony Blair was elected. The Labour Party had promised to halt the privatisation programme if it had won power soon enough, but O'Brien beat them to it. At the Labour party conference in September 1998, the then Secretary of State for Transport and Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott MP announced that he intended to have a 'spring clean of the regulators', and O'Brien immediately offered his resignation. He had no need to do so, but gained great credit in the railway industry for an honourable offer, which was thought to surprise Prescott. O'Brien was asked to stay on until Prescott had made his decision on the new post-holder. Prescott intended to set up a new regulatory body for the passenger railway, the Strategic Rail Authority, but he needed legislation to do so. The post of Franchising Director therefore remained to be filled until that legislation could be passed and brought into force. After announcing that Sir Alastair Morton would become the chairman of the SRA, Prescott needed to find a replacement for O'Brien. Morton secured the appointment of Mike Grant, a former colleague of Morton's from his Eurotunnel days and then head of Railtrack's property division. Grant became Franchising Director in April 2000, and remaining in that post until 1 February 2001 when the Transport Act 2000 was brought into force, abolishing the position of Franchising Director and creating the SRA. Grant was appointed as the first chief executive of the SRA, under Morton's chairmanship. He remained in that role until shortly after Richard Bowker took over as SRA chairman and combined the roles of chairman and chief executive.

It was produced and directed by Josef von Sternberg from a screenplay by Jules Furthman, and S. K. Lauren adapted from a story by Furthman and von Sternberg. The original story \\"Mother Love\\" was written by Dietrich herself. The musical score was by W. Franke Harling, John Leipold, Paul Marquardt, and Oscar Potoker, with cinematography by Bert Glennon. Dietrich performs three musical numbers in the film, including the now-obscure \\"You Little So-and-So\\" (music and lyrics by Sam Coslow and Leo Robin) and \\"I Couldn't Be Annoyed\\" (music and lyrics by Leo Robin and Richard A. Whiting). The highlight is the infamous \\"Hot Voodoo\\" (music by Ralph Rainger, lyrics by Sam Coslow), which is nearly 8 minutes in length and mostly instrumental, featuring jazz trumpet and drums. Dietrich sings the lyrics toward the end of the sequence, which takes place in a nightclub. Plot Ned Faraday, an American chemist, has been inadvertently poisoned with radium and expects to die within a year. Upon learning of Professor Holzapfel, a famous physician in Dresden who may be able to treat him, Ned decides to travel to Germany. That night, while putting his son Johnny to bed, Ned and his wife Helen recite the story of how they met. While traveling in Germany as a young man, Ned encountered Helen swimming in a pond with several other girls. She coyly told him she would grant him a wish if he left; Ned wished to see her again. Later that night, Ned encountered Helen performing onstage at a local theater. After Johnny falls asleep, Ned discusses with Helen the possibility of traveling to Germany to meet Professor Holzapfel. In an effort to help pay for the trip, Helen covertly returns to stage work. She finds employment at a local nightclub, where she befriends a fellow cabaret girl, Taxi. While at the club, Taxi informs Helen of Nick Townsend, a wealthy politician and frequent patron who gave her expensive jewels for \\"favors.\\" Helen attracts great attention in her first performance, \\"Hot VooDoo\\" (in which she dons an ape suit), and is noticed by Nick. Enamored of Helen, Nick approaches her after the show, and the two begin to talk. Upon learning of Ned's medical condition, Nick gifts her $300 as a downpayment for the trip. Helen eventually accumulates enough money to pay for Ned's trip, and he travels to Germany. After Ned's departure, Nick offers to house Helen and Johnny in an apartment, sparing her from having to work. She and Nick develop a romance, but after learning of Ned's impending return to the United States, she tells him she must end the relationship. The two spend a two-week vacation together just prior to Ned's scheduled return date; however, Ned arrives ahead of schedule, and finds his home empty. When Helen returns to the house after her vacation with Nick, she confesses to Ned that she has been unfaithful to him. Ned banishes her from the house, and threatens to sue her for custody of Johnny. Helen flees with Johnny, and the two live on the run, with Helen supporting them by performing in nightclubs. Ned reports Johnny as a missing person, and police begin to track Helen, who has rented a small apartment in New Orleans. There, she is eventually found by detectives, and voluntarily turns herself in. Realizing her lifestyle is unstable for Johnny, Helen agrees to return Johnny to Ned. Following an emotional breakdown, Helen begins to work relentlessly, singing and performing in cabarets. Her work eventually leads her to Paris, where she reunites with Nick, who appears at one of her shows. Nick again professes his love for her, and proposes marriage. She accepts, and agrees to accompany him back to the United States. Helen arranges a visit with Johnny, which is observed by Ned. Johnny requests that his mother again relay the story of how she met his father. Johnny begins to tell the story himself, encouraging Ned and Helen to join in the dialogue. This moves both Helen and Ned, who realize how their separation has affected Johnny. To calm Johnny, Helen begins singing a Heinrich Heine poem she used to sing to Johnny before bed each night. Cast Production Marlene Dietrich in the film trailer The Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA), formed by the film industry in 1922, regulated the content of films by reviewing scripts using the 1930 Motion Picture Production Code MPC) which, while banning forced prostitution (i.e., white slavery), required the subject of a woman engaging in solicitation to be treated carefully. During negotiations between director Sternberg and the MPPDA regarding scenes where Helen is found by Detective Wilson in New Orleans, any direct solicitation was removed from the script such that, in the film, the interaction between Helen and the private detective becomes ambiguous. Other aspects of the plot, such as adultery, remain inconsistent with the MPC, which was not strictly enforced until 1934. This enforcement of the MPC prevented Paramount from reissuing Blonde Venus after 1934.Jacobs 1997, p. 106. To promote the film, the September 1932 film magazine Screenland published the story \\"The Blonde Venus\\" by Mortimer Franklin. This was based upon the second version of the script and not the final filmed version, perhaps as this version was more similar to the romances that appealed to the magazine's female readers.Staiger 2000, p. 86. Reception Blonde Venus received a mixed reception upon release. Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times called it \\"muddled, unimaginative and generally hapless piece of work, relieved somewhat by the talent and charm of the German actress [Dietrich] and Herbert Marshall's valiant work in a thankless role\\". Jose Rodriguez of Script remarked that the theme is as \\"old as life, and almost as interesting\\", praising the \\"force\\" and \\"instinctive cunning\\" of the director. Forsythe Hardy of Cinema Quarterly gave the film a gushing review, calling the picture \\"more brilliantly polished than any other America has sent us this year\\". He particularly praised the cinematography, writing: \\"For an hour the screen is filled with a succession of lovely images‚Äîfinely assembled detail and imaginatively composed settings, photographed with a camera unusually sensitive\\". Blonde Venus is considered a cult film.Jobling, Paul (13 March 2014). \\"Advertising Menswear: Masculinity and Fashion in the British Media since 1945\\". A&C; Black ‚Äì via Google Books.

Amenities The village lies on the A4 road and on the River Avon, to which the Saltford and Kelston locks provide access. The low-lying area is prone to flooding. river Avon There are four public houses in the village: The Bird in Hand,The Bird In Hand, Saltford The Jolly Sailor, The Crown and The Riverside.The Riverside, Saltford Saltford possesses a number of listed buildings. In 1948 the residents started a community fund that was used to build a village hall. Saltford Hall was completed in 1961, after residents had given their time free to digging the foundations and building the main hall itself. Since its completion, it has been run by a voluntary charity, the Saltford Community Association.Saltford Community Association Its fund-raising committee not only raises the money to maintain and improve the Hall, it also supports local charities. The hall provides for local community events and services such as blood donation evenings, citizens advice, community support and entertainment. It has recently introduced a week-long village festival. History The parish of Saltford was part of the Keynsham Hundred. Governance Saltford Parish Council, like all parish councils of England, has responsibility for local issues. The parish falls within the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset, which was created in 1996 under the Local Government Act 1992. Fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the Great Western Ambulance Service. Saltford elects two councillors to the unitary authority, Bath and North East Somerset Council. Bath and North East Somerset's area covers some of the ceremonial county of Somerset, but is administered separately from the non-metropolitan county, whose headquarters are in Bath. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Wansdyke district and the City of Bath of the county of Avon. Before 1974 the parish was part of Keynsham Urban District. The parish is represented in the House of Commons as part of North East Somerset. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system; the sitting MP is Jacob Rees-Mogg (Conservative).Jacob Rees-Mogg MP Historic buildings St Mary's Church, Saltford, a Norman church dating back to the 12th century, is a Grade II listed building. The tower dates from Saxon times, although it has been extensively repaired and the top 10 feet were added later. The church used to include an external porch, but this was demolished in the 19th century and the stone used to build the vestry; the line of the porch can still be viewed on the ground, by the layout of the drainage. In the 19th century, there were internal changes to the church. For instance, an organ gallery was built in the early part of the century. Saltford Manor House, which lies west of the church, dates from around 1160, and was found through a survey by Country Life magazine to be the oldest continuously occupied house in England. Architectural historian John Goodall believes the house has details, particularly in the ornate windows, which date it securely to before 1150, and probably to around 1148, the completion date of Hereford Cathedral, with which it has some similarities. The fa√ßade of the house dates from the 17th century.Nikolaus Pevsner: North Somerset and Bristol, p. 254. The 18th-century Old Brass Mill, like the Manor House, is listed as Grade II* and is also a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The Brass Mill was one of a series along the Avon Valley powered by water wheels. Saltford House was built in 1771. In 1856 it bought by Admiral Benedictus Marwood Kelly who died there on 26 September 1867.

There is a sports and social club behind Saltford Hall that maintains a large area of open land leased from BANES and used mainly for football and cricket. The club is not for profit and has close links with Saltford Community Association. The village also has a thriving football club, which aims to cater for all age groups from about five years of age up to and including adults.

The stadium was completed in its current form in 1970 and initially held a capacity of 20,000 spectators. The site had previously been occupied by the Sportplatz Steffenstra√üe, which had already been used by BFC Dynamo and its predecessor, the football department of SC Dynamo Berlin. SC Dynamo Berlin played its first seasons at the Walter-Ulbricht-Stadion in Mitte, but moved to the Dynamo- Sportforum after the construction of the Berlin wall in 1961. SC Leipzig at the football stadium in the Dynamo-Sportforum in 1965. BFC Dynamo played only one season in the new stadium, before the team moved permanently to the larger and more centrally located Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in Prenzlauer Berg. The Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadion had become vacant when FC Vortw√§rts Berlin was relocated to Frankfurt an der Oder on 31 July 1971. The Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum was rarely used for larger matches from then. The stadium would be used mostly by the reserve team of BFC Dynamo, the BFC Dynamo II. Neverless, BFC Dynamo also played its 1972-73 UEFA Cup matches against SCO Angers, Levski Sofia and Liverpool F.C. at the stadium. The attendance of 20,000 spectators during the match against Liverpool F.C. on 29 November 1972 is still the record attendance for the stadium as of 2020. And the team also returned Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum in 1986, as the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn- Sportpark was under renovation during the 1986‚Äì87 DDR-Oberliga season. BFC Dynamo also played its 1986-87 European Cup matches against √ñrgryte IS and Br√∏ndby IF at the stadium. The match against √ñrgryte IF on 1 October 1986 was attended by 15,000 spectators. BFC Dynamo, under the interim name FC Berlin since February 1990, played its home matches in the 1990‚Äì91 2. Bundesliga play-off at the Stadion im Sportforum. The club then moved permently to Sportforum Hohensch√∂nhausen in September 1992. The stadium now has a capacity of 10,000 standing places and 2,400 seated places, of which 400 are roofed. BFC Dynamo made plans to buy the stadium in 1998. The plans eventually failed due to lack of financial resources. The club also made plans to completely rebuild the stadium in 2006. These plans did not materialize either. The Stadion im Sportforum was refurbished during the 2005-06 season, to include new fences and player tunnels required to meet security standards. BFC Dynamo moved permanently to the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark in the 2014‚Äì15 season, following its advance to the Regionalliga Nordost and the subsequent higher media and spectator interest. However, the club returned to play matches at the Stadion im Sportforum in 2019 due to security issues relating to the deteriorating state of the floodlights at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn- Sportpark, which resulted in a temporary closure of the stadium, and are set to return to the Stadion im Sportforum during the 2020‚Äì21 season, as the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark is planned to be demolished in 2020 and then completely redeveloped. The German Football Association (DFB) has classified the Stadion im Sportforum with a possible third division standard, if only a few small requirements are met, such as new press seats and a better separated press block. The Senate of Berlin is planning a renovation of the stadium for a cost of ‚Ç¨ 3 million as of 2020. Dynamo-Sporthalle The Dynamo-Sporthalle is an indoor sports hall with a capacity of 2,000 to 4,000 spectators located on the Wei√üenseer Weg. The sports hall was built from 1955 and 1958. It was inaugurated in presence of Walter Ulbricht, the president of SV Dynamo Erich Mielke and sprinter Christa Stubnick, among others, on 25 January 1958. It measures 47 meters in width, 65 meters in length and 15 meters in height inside, and thus allows several sports such as athletics, handball, boxing, judo, basketball and gymnastics. The Dynamo-Sporthalle was also used for congresses and political mass meetings during the East German era, such as the first Women's congress of the Democratic Women's League of Germany (DFD) on 25 June 1964. The Dynamo-Sporthalle was also the location for the special party congresses of the Socialist Unity Party (SED) on 8-9 and 16-17 December 1989, when the party decided to rename itself SED-PDS. The Dynamo-Sporthalle is still in operation and is used for various smaller events. Sporthotel and congress center The Sporthotel and congress center was built to serve the athletes training at the Sportforum and to complement the Sportforum. The facility contained a hotel with 200 beds, a congress center and a restaurant. The Sporthotel and congress center is located at the south-western end of the Sportforum (in the corner between Wei√üenseer Weg and Konrad-Wolf-Stra√üe). The Dynamo-Sporthotel was built from 1960 to 1962 as a hotel in three storeys with an attached restaurant. The facility was siginificiantly expanded in the late 1970s with the congress center in two to three storeys. The Sporthotel and congress center was built as a showcase complex for East German sports. It was used by athletes such as Franziska van Almsick of SC Dynamo Berlin and Claudia Pechstein, but became vacant in the 1990s and fell into disrepair.

Russian forces turned away relief workers, including representatives of Doctors Without Borders and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Reporters Without Borders protested Russian intimidation of the press in Pervomayskoye, its ban of medical assistance to civilians and its refusal to permit evacuation of the wounded. On the eighth night, despite Kulikov's assertion that three rings of security forces had surrounded the village, the Chechens broke out and escaped in the early morning of January 18, 1996.

However, only three or four hostages lost their lives, and some of them escaped in the chaos. A force of between 200 and 300 guerrillas arrived in the area from Chechnya, where rebel fighters grouped under the command of Maksud Ingulbayev (who was ordered by Dudayev). To aid the breakthrough they mounted a diversionary attack on the Russian lines from behind, briefly capturing a school building used by federal forces in the neighboring village of Sovetskoye (several kilometers from Pervomayskoye). The Chechen relief force, like Raduyev's detachment earlier, made its way undetected through Russian-patrolled areas of Chechnya and Dagestan; Russian officials later accused the residents of two nearby villages of collaboration with the rebels. Russian forces entered a destroyed village strewn with the corpses of Chechen fighters, Dagestani civilians and Russian troops. After the battle a Russian soldier unintentionally fired a cannon on his BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicle, hitting another armored vehicle which exploded and its fragments landed amongst the Alpha Group of the FSB, killing two commandos and injuring three.THE DEGRADATION OF RUSSIA'S SPECIAL FORCES, The Jamestown Foundation, May 17, 1996 The Chechens claimed to still hold more than 60 hostages, who were evacuated to the separatist-controlled town of Novogroznensky (aka Novogrozny) in the Gudermessky District of Chechnya.

The full extent of civilian casualties is uncertain; the Russian army denied access to the village by journalists during the attack, and independent observers were admitted only after the bodies of civilians were removed from the ruins.Brief summary of concerns about human rights violations in the Chechen Republic, Amnesty International 1996 According to Chechen separatist chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov, 90 Chechen fighters died during the crisis;Interview with Aslan Maskhadov Yeltsin reported that 153 Chechen fighters were killed and 30 captured.Yeltsin Criticized for Handling of Chechen Hostage Crisis, New York Times, January 20, 1996 Western analysts estimated losses at 96 Chechen fighters and at least 26 civilians killed, plus about 200 federal casualties (including those killed at Kizlyar).07 MR1173.ch3 The hostages evacuated by their Chechen captors from Pervomayskoye included at least a dozen captured servicemen and police officers. On January 19, Raduyev proposed an exchange of the police hostages for the seriously-wounded fighters he had left behind, and the Chechens expressed their willingness to turn over the remaining civilian hostages to Dagestani authorities. A special resolution by the Russian State Duma granted a special amnesty for 11 captured guerrillas, who were then exchanged for the Novosibirsk policemen seized near Pervomayskoye; a CNN report said the prisoners were \\"12 Russian soldiers and six police officers\\".Chechen rebel leader still defiant; hostage release delayed , CNN, January 23, 1996In Chechnya, little faith in amnesty , Prague Watchdog, August 9th 2006 On January 27 the bodies of 26 dead Chechen fighters, swapped for civilian hostagesYELTSIN, ZAVGAEV ON CHECHEN PROSPECTS., Radio Free Europe, 24 January 1996 and returned by Russian authorities through Dagestani intermediaries, were buried at the Tsotsin-Yurt village cemetery for the 400 Chechens killed fighting Russian forces during the Russian Civil War in 1919.PERVOMAISKOYE DEBACLE REVERBERATES IN NORTH CAUCASUS., The Jamestown Foundation, January 30, 1996 The hostages \\"freed\\" in Pervomayskoye were interned in poor conditions in Russian filtration camps. Aftermath The Russian government reacted hawkishly to the \\"liberation of Pervomayskoye\\"; Yelstin initially said that \\"all the bandits have been destroyed, unless there are some still hiding underground\\", the operation was \\"planned and carried out correctly\\" and \\"is over with a minimum of losses to the hostages and our own people.\\"David Hoffman, Rebels Beaten, Hostages Freed, Yeltsin Declares , The Washington Post, January 19, 1996 Chernomyrdin said, \\"It is clear to everyone that it is pointless to talk to these people [Chechen separatists]. They are not the kind of people you can negotiate with.\\" U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry affirmed solidarity with Yeltsin's government, saying that Russia was justified in using military force in response to hostage-taking. The operation triggered outrage in Dagestan and across Russia, especially in liberal circles. Grigory Yavlinsky said, \\"It is time to face the fact that we are in a real civil war now in Russia. This was not a hostage crisis. It is a hopeless war, and it was started by Boris Yeltsin.\\" Yeltsin's human-rights commissioner, Sergei Kovalev, resigned from all his posts in protest of the \\"cruel punitive action\\" and Yegor Gaidar drafted a letter calling on Yeltsin not to run in the upcoming presidential elections. In a January 19 Interfax poll, 75 percent of respondents in Moscow and Saint Petersburg thought that all the \\"power ministers\\" should resign. The incident's handling was widely criticized by Russian and foreign journalists, humanitarian organizations and human-rights groups. Russian press accounts (including an account from Izvestia correspondent Valery Yakov, who witnessed the fighting from inside the village) described a chaotic, overmanned and bungled Russian operation in Pervomayskoye; Pavel Felgenhauer wrote that the armed services involved in the assault displayed a \\"fantastic lack of coordination.\\" An opinion piece in The New York Times said, \\"All this bloodshed and confusion was dressed up in Moscow with Soviet-style propaganda, including false claims about minimal Russian losses and the elimination of enemy forces. The use of force against terrorism should be commensurate with the threat and employed in a way that limits the loss of life. Military action should be accompanied by full disclosure of information about the conflict and casualties. The murderous assault on Pervomayskoye did not meet any of those tests.\\"The Assault on Pervomayskoye , The New York Times, January 19, 1996 The hostage crisis split the Chechens, with Salman Raduyev denounced by top Chechen rebel leaders. Polish fighter Miros≈Çaw Kuleba (Mehmed Borz) met Raduyev two months after the crisis, and believed that the latter may have intended to ignite a broader civil war in Dagestan. Kuleba felt that Raduyev tried to disguise in conversation that capturing a hospital and taking hostages had been planned and was not a desperate measure. Miros≈Çaw Kuleba, Szamil Basajew, page 184 In March 1996, Raduyev was shot in the head (in what some reports described as an ambush by rival guerrillas), and reportedly killed.Chechen rebel leader killed, reports say; Fierce fighting erupts , CNN, March 6, 1996 However, he resurfaced after Dzhokhar Dudayev's death with his shattered head reconstructed with metal plates, and after the war became a seemingly mentally-unstable leader of an unruly private militia called General Dudayev's Army. Raduyev was eventually captured by the Russians during the Second Chechen War in 2000. In 2001 he was sentenced to life imprisonment, dying in a prison colony in 2002. That year, Turpal-Ali Atgeriyev (sentenced to 15 years) also died in prison. Both of them died under mysterious circumstances.IMPRISONED CHECHEN FIELD COMMANDER DIES MYSTERIOUSLY, CA-CI, December 16, 2002 At least two other participants were sentenced for their roles in the raid during the 2000s, despite a 1996 amnesty: Aslanbek Alkhazurov to five years (he died in prison in 2004)Secret execution of Chechens in prisons of Russia, Chechenpress, 2 March 2004 and Husein Gaisumov to eight years.Raduev‚Äôs appeal rejected, Prima News, 12.4.2002 Of the other Chechen commanders in Pervomayskoye, Khunkar-Pasha Israpilov was killed in 2000 while leading another breakout from Grozny (with several other commanders, he went ahead to clear a path through a minefield).Lyoma Turpalov, Chechens' Corpses Paved Path Across Minefield , Associated Press, February 5, 2000 Suleiman Bustayev left Chechnya as a refugee to live in the European Union, where he became active in Akhmed Zakayev's Chechen government-in-exile. Related hostage crises Turkish authorities coped effectively with the hijackers of the Panamanian-registered ferry Avrazya, which was captured on January 16 by an armed group of nine Turkish citizens of Caucasian origin who were sympathetic to the rebels in Pervomaiskoye. Turkish authorities, in continuous communication and negotiations with the captors and ignoring Russian demands for tough action, secured the safe release of the captives (177 mostly-Russian passengers and a Turkish crew of 55) and the surrender of the gunmen without bloodshed.Pro-Chechen Ferry Hijackers Surrender to Turks, The New York Times, January 20, 1996 In another hostage-taking incident, on January 17 a group of 29 employees of the Kirov heating plant near Grozny (Russian engineers from Rostov) was kidnapped for ransom by a group led by Arbi Barayev. Thirty-eight other civilians (mostly ethnic Russians) had been kidnapped during the previous week in Chechnya's rebel-controlled Achkhoy- Martanovsky District, and offered in exchange for Chechen fighters in Russian captivity and civilian Chechen inmates of Russian filtration camps; their release was negotiated later that month.CIVILIAN HOSTAGES IN CHECHNYA TO BE FREED., The Jamestown Foundation, January 23, 1996 See also *Beslan school hostage crisis *Moscow theatre hostage crisis References External links *One day in the death of Pervomayskoye by Andrei Kolesnikov Category:20th-century mass murder in Russia Category:Battles of the First Chechen War Category:Battles involving Chechnya Category:Hostage taking in Russia Category:Military scandals Category:Terrorist incidents in Russia in 1996 Category:Mass murder in Russia Category:Mass murder in 1996 Category:January 1996 events in Europe ","title":"Kizlyar-Pervomayskoye hostage crisis"},{"id":"8030475","text":"Daud Khan Panni (? ‚Äì 6 September 1715) aka Daud Khan was a Mughal commander, Nawab of the Carnatic and later Nawab of Kurnool. He was an ethnic Pashtun from the panni tribe and was from Bijapur, Karnataka. Life In 1703, Daud Khan was appointed as the Nawab of the Carnatic. Before he was made Nawab, the Emperor Aurangazeb appointed him as a leading commander of the Mughal Army in 1701, while Zulfikhar Ali Khan was the Nawab. Daud Khan made his bases at Arcot and often received assistance from Asaf Jah I the Faujdar of the Carnatic and Talikota. During his tenure, he made frequent visits to Santhome and tried to develop it. But due to the efforts of Thomas Pitt, the then Governor of the British East India Company, Daud Khan had to defer his plans. Like Zulfikhar Ali Khan, Daud Khan also enjoyed the confidence of the Emperor Aurangazeb and had control over all the territories south of the River Krishna. In one of his visits to Fort St. George, the streets were lined with soldiers. The line of soldiers was from the St. Thome Gate up to the Fort and the certain of the inner Fort was manned by train bands. The Governor, Thomas Pitt, conducted him into the Fort, carried him up to his lodgings. Such was the respect he commanded with the East India Company. =Conflicts with the British East India Company= In the year 1702, Daud Khan the Mughal Empire's local Subedar of the Carnatic, besieged and blockaded Fort St. George for more than three months, the governor of the fort Thomas Pitt was instructed by the British East India Company to vie for peace. . In 1702, it is probably believed that the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb ordered Daud Khan the Mughal Empire's local Subedar (lieutenant), to besiege and blockade Fort St. George for more than three months, the governor of the fort Thomas Pitt was instructed by the British East India Company to vie for peace. Thomas Pitt began garrisoning British East India Company forts by raising regiments of local Sepoy's by hiring from Hindu warrior castes, he armed them with the latest weapons and positioned them under the command of British officers to save Madras, his base of operations from further Mughal harassment. On 5 October 1708, Daud Khan issued a Firman granting the English East India Company and the five villages of Tiruvottiyur, Nungambakkam, Vysarpady, Kathiwakam and Sattangadu west of Tiruvottiyur. In 1710, Daud Khan was recalled to Delhi to discharge more responsible work as Commander-in-Chief of the Mughal Army. He was appointed to Viceroy of Deccan. On 6 September 1715, Husain Ali Khan awaited the encounter with Daud Khan. Daud Khan, unfortunately, was killed by a stray bullet in this battle and died. He was winning the battle until he died. His death led to his army being defeated in the battle near Burhanpur. War elephants In 1703, the Mughal commander at Coromandel, Daud Khan Panni spent 10,500 coins to purchase 30 to 50 war elephants from Ceylon.

This archeological site has yielded a carbon 14 dating of 7100 BC for its Neolithic levels. Today it lies on the eastern side of Allahabad, across the river Ganges and connected to the city by the Shastri Bridge, and is considered an important part of the history of Allahabad or Prayag, city's former name. History Pratishthana was the most important locality of Prayag and it was founded by King Ila and was the capital of Pururavas and other kings of Lunar Dynasty. Once belonging to the rulers of Maurya, Shunga, Kushana and Gupta period, the ancient Pratisthana has lost its identity to the modernity of Jhunsi. The only evidence related to this historical fact is still visible in the shape of high mounds in Jhunsi. Surprisingly, these high mounds have further added to the significance of the city as the articles excavated from here belong to the 6th century BC and antiquities belonging to five cultural phases ranging from chalcolithic to early medieval period have been found here. As per the historians and the pre NBP ware deposit the site of Kumbh Mela is marked at this place as the earliest culture represented at the site. Early layer of this deposit has yielded iron objects. Some pottery items and antiquities are similar to those found at different chalcolithic sites in UP, Bihar and Northern Vindhyas. =Destruction= It is also said that the town was destroyed in an earthquake in CE 1359 as a result of the invocations of saint Ali Mur-taza. The historian Dr. D. P. Dubey These traditions and the etymological meaning of the name Jhunsi possibly indicate to the destruction and burning of the site by the Muslim invaders in the 13th century CE. The traditions relating to the scattering of Brahmana and Kshatriya clans abandoning their homes in Jhunsi and emigrating to distant places during the medieval period lend colour to this theory. There is also the historical and sacred Samudrakoop here which has its own story. \\"It is known as Samudrakoop since it belongs to the period of Samudragupta. In fact five such wells are found in Ujjain, Mathura, Prayag (Allahabad), Varanasi and Patalpur (Pataliputra or Patna). It was dumped with garbage once but the efforts of a sage Dayaram brought its historical importance to limelight.\\" Archaeology From the pre-Northern Black Polished Ware (NBP Ware) period (ca. 700 BC‚Äì200 BC) to the Gupta period there had been continuous settlement at the site. However, there appears to be a cultural gap between the end of Gupta period and the beginning of early medieval period. \\"There is every likelihood that the site may show up no gap at all when excavated extensively. This possibility is based on the strategic location of the site itself which, by virtue of the same reason, would have never been abandoned after having been once occupied. The excavations in the area only hint at the above fact.\\" The ruins of ancient Pratishthana which are represented by the high mounds of Jhunsi on the eastern bank of the Ganges are spread over an area of about four square miles. Research on lost heritage of Allahabad under Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) suggests that the site is slowly losing its identity on account of continuous erosion of the Ganges river. \\"The high mound, which belong to Kushana period, has few bricks exposed right now\\". In literature Kalidasa too mentions about Pratishthana in his Sanskrit drama Vikram≈çrva≈õƒ´yam. He has given an imaginary account of this palace of Pururavas which was magnificent. Various myths are also associated with this site. An inscription of Trilochanapala, the Pratihara king, was discovered from the site in 1830. In his book, VN Pandey mentions that the naming of Jhunsi too has a legend associated with it. It was once ruled by Har-bonga, an imbecile and foolish king in whose reign chaos prevailed everywhere. When the cup of his inequity was full there was an upheaval on the earth and the capital Pratishthana was turned upside down hence now known as 'Ulta Quila'. There was conflagration which completed the destruction of the city and the ruins went by the name of Jhunsi, a burnt town from the Hindi root 'jhulasna'. Ramdhari Singh Dinakar wrote \\"Urvashi\\", a poem which narrated the story of love between Urvashi, a celestial nymph, and Pururava, the king of Pratisthan Pur.  Ulta Kila  It is said that once the saint Ali Mur-taza (maqdoom sahab) was invited on the lunch by the king haribong who lived on this kila. King Haribong gave him the wrong things to eat. This made Saint Ali-Murtaza angy and he ordered the planet Mars (named Mirrikh in Arabic) to fall on that kila, and as the order the star fell on the kila and the whole kila burnt out and this gave it the name, ulta kila and also this was the origin of the name jhuns(which means burnt). Kamayani is written by Jai Shankar Prasad based on battle between Pururava and Ila and later they had fierce love, in the backdrop of Pratishthanpur.

Early Life and career Toerien's theatre career started while still at school, presenting puppet shows to schools in his home town of Cape Town. At age 17, he introduced the concept of bio-vaudeville ‚Äì persuading cinema managements to have live entertainment before the feature film. Under the mentorship of Britain's theatre agent Herbert de Leon and in partnership with Basil Rubin, he brought British variety artists such as Alma Cogan and Dickie Valentine to South Africa, eventually adding Russ Conway (1964), Peter Nero (1966), Shelly Berman, Cyd Charisse, Tony Martin, Fran√ßoise Hardy and Maurice Chevalier (1967) to his list of luminaries. At the age of 20 he sat on the street outside the apartment of German actress Marlene Dietrich, until curiosity compelled her to invite him in. He signed her to tour in 1965 and again in 1966, which he considered his \\"greatest coup\\",Original page for the South African production of the musical Dirty Dancing and they remained friends until her death in 1992. In 1966 he tentatively shifted to the dramatic stage, often bringing entire productions from the West End to South Africa. Funding all his own productions, he famously claimed that he produced farce and comedy to subsidise less commercial theatre. Continuing with the successful business formula of signing overseas box-office attractions, he brought names such as Hermione Gingold from New York for No√´l Coward's Fallen Angels and Joan Fontaine for Fredrick Knott's thriller Dial M for Murder. Other names included Barbara Windsor, June Whitfield and Sir Michael Redgrave. When the word 'gay' was still taboo, Toerien brought The Other Side of the Swamp to the boards. Writer Royce Ryton himself played opposite Eckard Rabe under Graham Armitage's direction. By running for a year, this production broke a South African record. Writers Ben Travis, Ray Clooney and Alan Ayckbourn became audience favourites, as did Agatha Christie. From the early 1980s, British comedy actor and director Rex Garner became associated with Toerien for many box office successes, including Ray Cooney's Out of Order and It Runs in the Family, Michael Pertwee's Birds of Paradise and Robin Hawdon's rewrite of Marc Camoletti's Don't Dress for Dinner, which saw a 2013 revival in Toerien's own theatre complex to critical acclaim. In partnership with Shirley Firth, Toerien owned The Intimate, a 235-seater theatre, as well as The Barnato and the Andre Huguenot theatres. In 1980 he saved an old theatre from demolition and opened The Alhambra in Braamfontein with Peter Shaffer's Amadeus. Refurbishing the old building, he added two more theatres to the complex ‚Äì the Leonard Rayne, opened on 18 July 1983, (renamed the Rex Garner in 1994) and the Richard Haines Theatres. In 1988 he purchased the derelict Alvin Cinema in Camps Bay. Together with designer Jan Corewyn, they transformed it with a post modern fa√ßade draped with a sculptured curtain, and named it Theatre on the Bay. In the 1980s, Toerien also brought Sir Cameron Mackintosh's Tom Foolery to South Africa. This association resulted in South Africa receiving many of the phenomenal successes of Macintosh's London musical theatre, including Les Mis√©rables, Cats ‚Äì which toured Scandinavia, the Far East and Beirut and The Phantom of the Opera ‚Äì which toured the Far East, ending in Hong Kong. These were followed by The Sleeping Beauty on Ice, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and Jesus Christ Superstar, which was originally banned in South Africa as blasphemous after it opened on Broadway in 1971, and which travelled to Athens in 2007. With the decentralisation of Johannesburg's CBD, Toerien moved his Alhambra operation to the north of Johannesburg, where he opened the Pieter Toerien's Montecasino Theatre and Studio in the Montecasino complex. Here he runs two theatres ‚Äì a main theatre with 320 seats and a 160-seater studio. Lining the walls of Toerien's theatres are photographs of the innumerable actors who have worked for him over the years, as well as posters of past productions such as Sleuth, A Streetcar Named Desire, Equus, Amadeus, Agnes of God, M. Butterfly, Master Class, Private Lives, Stage Struck, Quartermaine's Terms and Side by Side by Sondheim. The works of such eminent British writers as No√´l Coward, Tom Stoppard, Simon Gray and Peter Shaffer have all been mounted in Toerien's theatres. 2007 saw the staging of The Lion King in a new 1900 seater lyric theatre in the Montecasino complex, called the Teatro. During the period of South Africa's transition he worked extensively with WESTAG Task Group on the Performing Arts sub-committee. In this area of civic responsibility, he also gave of his expertise on the CAPAB board to assist them in their adjustment to become Artscape. He was also on the board of the National Arts Council and the Western Cape Cultural Commission.

It is also the largest and most populous urban centre in the country, a position it has held continuously since first rising to prominence in the 10th century (with the exception of a brief period in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when it was temporarily eclipsed by Belfast). The historic town grew up on the southern bank of the River Liffey, a few kilometres upstream from the river's outfall into Dublin Bay. The original settlement was situated on a ridge overlooking a shallow ford in the river, which had probably been a regular crossing-point since earliest times. The bedrock underlying the city is calp limestone, a dark shaly sedimentary rock which was once quarried locally and whose mottled grey appearance can still be seen today in some of the city's oldest buildings. Overlying this is a layer of much looser boulder clay of varying thickness. It is no accident that Dublin became the principal city in Ireland. It is located on the island's only significant coastal plain, which not only forms a natural gateway to the rest of the country but also looks out towards the country's closest and most influential neighbour, Great Britain. Furthermore, Dublin Bay provided early settlers with a substantial and easily defended harbour, protected to some extent by treacherous sandbanks, shallows and mudflats, and overlooked by the twin sentinels of Howth Head and Killiney Hill. Early history The first known inhabitants of the Dublin region were hunter- gatherers living during the Later Mesolithic, or Middle Stone Age, around 5500 BC. Shell middens, fish traps and occupation debris, which have been found at a number of locations on and around the shores of Dublin Bay (most notably at Sutton, on Dalkey Island), at the Diageo site at Victoria Quay and at Spencer Dock, which is situated along the northern quays, near the mouth of the River Liffey, indicate that these early settlers lived off the sea. The first farmers appeared in the Neolithic, or New Stone Age, shortly after 4000 BC. These were the first to erect megalithic monuments and evidence of their culture survives in the burial cairns, passage tombs, portal tombs and wedge tombs that can still be seen in the Dublin Mountains and on the coastal lowlands just to the south of the modern city. Stone axes made of porcellanite from County Antrim or porphyry from Lambay Island have also been discovered at a number of sites in the Dublin region. Pottery too was first manufactured in Ireland during the Neolithic, one of the most noteworthy finds being a funerary bowl which was found in a burial site at Drimnagh, County Dublin. Around 2400 BC metal working made its first appearance in Ireland. Archaeological excavations in Suffolk Street have uncovered prehistoric copper axe-heads ‚Äì the copper axe being the principal metal artifact during the earliest phase of Irish metallurgy (the so-called Knocknagur Phase, or Copper Age, which lasted from 2400‚Äì2200 BC). The Bronze Age, which in Ireland is dated from 2200‚Äì600 BC, also left its mark on the Dublin region. A variety of bronze and gold artifacts which have been discovered in the vicinity of the modern city ‚Äì among them cauldrons, side-blown horns, lock rings, sleeve fasteners, striated rings, hair rings and penannular bracelets ‚Äì indicate a continuous or intermittent settlement of the area. In Ireland the commencement of the Iron Age around 600 BC is generally believed to coincide with the first appearance in this country of Celtic-speaking peoples. There is little archaeological evidence to support the theory of a large-scale Celtic invasion (or series of invasions), but it is quite possible that small groups of migrants, highly skilled in the art of war and armed with superior iron weaponry, were powerful enough to gain a foothold in the island and eventually succeeded in subjugating or absorbing the pre-Celtic natives; in the 12th century of the Common Era small bands of heavily armed Anglo-Normans did just this, so there is no conceivable reason why it could not also have happened in the pre-Christian era. Iron ores are widely distributed throughout Ireland ‚Äì one of the country's two richest deposits is to be found in County Wicklow, just a few days' walk from the Dublin region ‚Äì but there is little archaeological evidence for an urban settlement on the site of the modern city during the Early Iron Age (or Athlone Phase). Excavations at various locations in the region, however, do indicate intermittent occupation at scattered locations throughout this period (e.g. at Taylor's Grange in Rathfarnham, and at Cherrywood near Loughlinstown). Once associated with the Iron Age is the ringfort, or r√°th, a defensive formation generally consisting of one or more circular earthen embankments surrounded by a ditch. The existence of ringforts in the Dublin region may be deduced from the names of several of the modern city's suburbs: Rathmines, Rathgar, Rathfarnham (on the south side of the city) and Raheny (on the north side). There is also the village of Rathcoole, which lies to the southwest of the modern city. Needless to say the growth of the modern city has all but obliterated these structures, but excavation of ringforts in other parts of the country has sometimes revealed traces of earlier, pre-ringfort occupation of the same sites. In the Dublin hinterland, surviving ringforts are too numerous to mention individually, though a univallate ringfort at Rathmichael (near Shankill to the southeast of the city) may be noted. The lowlying area to the northwest of the city is particularly rich in ringforts. It is now thought, however, that most of Ireland's ringforts date from the Christian era. Pre-Viking Dublin Dublin in the early 9th century Although the site of the modern city of Dublin has been occupied intermittently since the Mesolithic era, it is not known when the first permanent settlement was established. Ptolemy's description of Ireland, which was compiled around 140 AD but which may draw on much earlier accounts, was once thought to contain a reference to Dublin in Eblana, the name of a settlement on the east coast; this, however, is no longer thought likely and the similarity of the two names is probably coincidental. Early Dublin is also referred to in a number of native sources. The Book of Invasions, a largely fabulous compilation of myths and legends, mentions Dublin when describing how two legendary kings of Ireland, Conn of the Hundred Battles and Mug Nuadat, divided the country between them. The line of demarcation, which cut the island into two symbolic halves (known as Leth Cuinn, or \\"Conn's Half\\", and Leth Moga, or \\"Mug's Half\\") ran along the Esker Riada from High Street in Dublin to Galway on the west coast. According to another work which draws on early sources, the Annals of the Four Masters, Fiachu Sraibtine, the king of Tara, quelled the rebellious inhabitants of Leinster in a battle fought at Dublin in 291 AD; the Annals of Dublin also record that Alphin mac Eochaid, King of Dublin, was converted to Christianity by Saint Patrick in 448 AD. But these entries were only added to the Annals', or the sources from which they were compiled, many centuries after the events they purport to record, and no reliance can be placed on them. The simple fact is that we do not know for certain when the city of Dublin was founded. When contemporary records begin in the 5th century, there is a thriving community of farmers and fishermen in existence in the vicinity of Cornmarket and High Street. A ringed pattern of streets and laneways which can still be discerned in this part of the modern city may be a relic of the original boundary of an early settlement. Located on a prominent ridge overlooking the River Liffey (previously known as the Ruirthech, \\"running swiftly\\"), this settlement was easily defended and ideally situated to take advantage of the ford, which lay just 100 metres away. The River Liffey, at the point where the ford of hurdles was located The name ford of hurdles ‚Äì √Åth Cliath in Irish ‚Äì suggests that, to facilitate travellers who wished to cross the river dry-shod during low tide, the inhabitants of this settlement constructed a lattice-work of interlaced osiers ‚Äì hurdles ‚Äì and secured it to the muddy bed of the river, perhaps making use of the fortuitously placed Usher's Island in the middle of the stream. It is also possible that a series of hurdles used as fish-traps were placed along the banks of the river. The hurdles were probably located about 100 metres west of the point where Father Mathew Bridge now crosses the Liffey, but in the absence of archaeological evidence both its nature and precise location must remain matters of speculation. In ancient times the lower course of the Liffey is believed to have formed part of the boundary between the provinces, or overkingdoms, of Leinster and Mide (though there is some conflicting evidence which suggests that the boundary was actually marked by another river, the Tolka, which now discharges into Dublin Bay about a kilometre north of the Liffey). √Åth Cliath, which belonged to Leinster, must have been an important trading place thanks to its strategic location on this political boundary. Early roads It is also hardly a coincidence that four of the five great highways, or of ancient Ireland converged on the site of the medieval city, and not on Tara, as early Irish historians spuriously claimed: *Slige Midluachra ‚Äì this road ran southeast from Ulster, and passed through Tara, the seat of the High Kings of Ireland in County Meath. It crossed the Liffey at the ford of hurdles, and came to an end just south of √Åth Cliath. Parts of the Slige Midluachra may still be made out in some of Dublin's modern streets: e.g. Bow Street on the north side of the city, and St Augustine Street and Francis Street on the south side. *Slige Mh√≥r ‚Äì this was the \\"great highway\\" that ran from east to west across the entire country, dividing it into two symbolic halves (Leth Cuinn and Leth Moga). Its eastern terminus lay just beyond √Åth Cliath. In the modern city, James's Street and Thomas Street still follow its course. *Slige Chualann ‚Äì this road ran south from √Åth Cliath. It took its name from Cualu, the district in which Dublin was situated and which lay between the mouths of the Liffey and the Avoca (in County Wicklow). Long stretches of the Slige Chualann survive to this day. In the modern city its early course is followed by New Street, Clanbrassil Street, Harold's Cross Road and Terenure Road North, it then carries on past Rathfarnham Castle, returns to its original mountain tract beyond Marlay Park, today known as The Wicklow Way, a long-distance trail inaugurated in 1980, follows much of the course of Slige Chualann. *Slige D√°la ‚Äì the fourth great highway was the \\"highway of the assemblies\\". It approached √Åth Cliath from the southwest, following the course of the Commons' Water, a small tributary of the river Poddle, which in turn is a tributary of the Liffey. Its terminus was at the southern end of the ecclesiastical settlement of Dubhlinn (see below). It survives today in Cork Street, Ardee Street and The Coombe. These four highways linked Dublin with the five provinces of ancient Ireland: Ulster and Mide to the north, Connacht to the west, Munster to the southwest and Leinster to the south. Although it is not known when these roads were first constructed, a tract dating from around 700 testifies to their early existence. A fifth, unnamed road may have linked √Åth Cliath with Tara, County Meath, the seat of the High Kings of Ireland. It is possible that traces of this road are preserved in the modern thoroughfare that runs northwest from Stoneybatter (i.e. the Stoney b√≥thar, or \\"cow-track\\") through Ratoath Road in the general direction of Tara. The existence of this unnamed road suggests that the Slige Midluachra originally by-passed Tara, running north from Dublin to Emain Macha. √Åth Cliath was centred on the crossroads formed by the intersection of the Slige Midluachra and Slige Mh√≥r. After the introduction of Christianity a wayside chapel dedicated to St Mo Lua appears to have been erected at this junction, though the earliest reference to such a church is of a much later date. Another early church, dedicated to St Columba, occupied the site of the present Church of St Audoen, which is thought to be the city's oldest surviving church site. The existence of a market place to the east of the junction is suggested by the modern street name of Cornmarket. The southwestern approaches of √Åth Cliath may have been protected by a ditch, which is mentioned in two 13th century documents. In addition to the urban settlement at √Åth Cliath, the early inhabitants of Dublin may also have constructed a ringfort, or r√°th, on the present site of Dublin Castle. This would have been a relatively easy place to defend, being the highest point in the area and surrounded by water on three sides. It could also explain why the eastern terminus of the Slige Mh√≥r lay several hundred metres beyond √Åth Cliath. If such a rath did exist, it may have been the source of the placename Druim Cuill-Choille, or \\"Hazelwood Ridge\\": according to Harris (1736), this was the city's original name, though no ancient references to such a name are now extant. The name Baile √Åtha Cliath itself was first written down in the Annals of Ulster in 1365, some 200 years after the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169, and the Irish word \\"baile\\" (meaning a town), often anglicized as \\"bally\\", derives from Norman-French \\"bailee\\" or \\"ville\\". It remains unproven that it was called √Åth Cliath before 795, but for convenience the western of the two settlements is usually referred to by historians and archaeologists as \\"√Åth Cliath\\" to distinguish it from \\"Duiblinn\\" (see below). The existence of other early ringforts in the vicinity of √Åth Cliath may be deduced from the names of several of the modern city's suburbs: Rathmines, Rathgar, Rathfarnham and Raheny, though no firm dates can be assigned to any of these. Duiblinn The original site of the black pool from which Dublin takes its name By the early 7th century √Åth Cliath had acquired a neighbour in the form of a large and important ecclesiastical settlement about half a kilometre to the southeast. Referred to in various annals and martyrologies as Duiblinn (Modern Irish Dubhlinn, or \\"Blackpool\\"), it took its name from a dark tidal pool in the River Poddle a short distance to the north. (This pool no longer exists, but its location is marked by the site of the Coach House and Castle Gardens at the rear of Dublin Castle.) Covering an area of about 5 hectares, Dubhlinn was one of the largest settlements of its kind in the country, and shared its distinctive pear-shaped outline with hundreds of other ecclesiastical or quasi-ecclesiastical enclosures of the time. This outline can still be discerned in the morphology of the modern city, especially in the oval configuration of St Peter's Row, Whitefriar Street, Upper and Lower Stephen Street, and Johnson's Place. In later centuries, this area was served by the local parish church of St Peter's on The Mount, which may have replaced a much earlier church. However, recent archaeological excavations at the site of another church, St Michael le Pole, between Chancery Lane and Ship Street, have led some historians to surmise that the ecclesiastical settlement of Dubhlinn was located here rather than at St Peter's. As its name suggests, St Michael le Pole ‚Äì that is, \\"St Michael of the Pool\\" ‚Äì overlooked the \\"Black Pool\\" from which Dubhlinn took its name. It lay some 300 metres to the west of St Peter's, outside the latter's pear-shaped enclosure. In common with many other early sites, St Michael's had a round tower, and it is known to have been in existence by the late seventh century. Graves going back to the 8th century have been unearthed at the site of another early church, St Bride's (or St Bridget's), on the corner of Bride Road and Bride St. This site may have been part of the same ecclesiastical complex as St Michael le Pole's, though the church of St Bride itself seems to belong to a later period. Stephen Street Upper, which follows the course of the northwestern boundary of Duiblinn. The approximate location of St Peter's on The Mount is marked by the white wall near the right-hand edge of the image. Whatever its precise location, Dubhlinn probably served as the chief place of worship of the U√≠ Fergusa, a small and politically insignificant sept of the U√≠ D√∫nlainge (an important confederation of Gaelic septs which monopolised the kingship of Leinster from 738‚Äì1042). A number of early sources refer to Abbots and Bishops of Dubhlinn, with little distinction between the two offices. Among these the following may be noted: * St Beraidh (‚Ä†650) ‚Äì Beraidh's death in 650 is recorded in the Annals of the Four Masters, where he is described as Abbot of Dublin. * St Livinus (‚Ä†663) ‚Äì Livinus, or Lebwin, was the son of a Scottish nobleman and an Irish princess. He was raised in Ireland and studied there and in England. He was ordained by St Augustine of Canterbury. He led a successful mission to Flanders with three companions and became Bishop of Ghent. He was martyred on 12 November 663 by pagans, who tore out his tongue to stop him preaching ‚Äì according to legend his tongue continued to preach on its own. His martyrdom is depicted in a famous painting by Peter Paul Rubens * St Disibod (619‚Äì700) ‚Äì Disibod, or Disens, was Livinus's successor; he was allegedly driven from Dublin by violence in 640; he emigrated to the Continent with three disciples; in 653 he moved to the confluence of the Nahe and Glan rivers in Germany, where he founded a community which he led for more than 40 years; a monastery which was later founded on the same site was called Disibodenberg, or Mount Disbod (subsequently Disenberg), in his honour. Disibod's life was written by Hildegard of Bingen in the 12th century. * St Wiro ‚Äì Wiro also led a mission to the Continent; he is generally associated with two Northumbrian saints, Plechelm and Otger, with whom he made a pilgrimage to Rome. Around 700 he settled at Roermond in the Netherlands at the request of Pippin of Herstal; his relics are preserved in the local cathedral, which is named after him. * St Gualafer (fl. 740) ‚Äì Gualafer is mentioned as Bishop of Dublin in 740; he is said to have baptised and instructed his successor, Rumold, but otherwise nothing is known of him. * St Rumold (‚Ä†775) ‚Äì Rumold, or Rumbold, was an Irish or English monk who is described in some sources as Bishop of Dublin. He made a pilgrimage to Rome; later he preached at Mechelen, Brabant and in Flanders. He was martyred near Mechelen, of which he is the patron saint; St. Rumbolds Cathedral in Mechelen is dedicated to him and contains his relics. He is sometimes said to be the son of a Scottish king. * St Sedulius (‚Ä†785) ‚Äì Sedulius, or Siadhal, was Bishop or Abbot of Dublin. His death in 785 is recorded in the Annals of the Four Masters, where he is described as Abbot of Dublin. * Cormac (fl. 890) ‚Äì A certain Cormac is also described by at least one source as Bishop of Dublin in the 9th century. According to D'Alton's Memoirs of the Archbishops of Dublin (1838), he was Bishop in 890 when Gregory (i.e. Giric), King of Scotland, supposedly besieged and captured Dublin ‚Äì a story that is now regarded as chimerical. According to Harris (1736), St Sedulius was the last Abbot of Dublin to be mentioned in the Annals. In 795, just ten years after his death, the Vikings, or Norsemen, launched their first raid on Irish soil: a new era in the history of Dublin was about to begin.

It is a world breed: it has been exported to many countries and is present on all continents.  History  The Normande originated in Normandy in the early nineteenth century. It resulted from cross-breeding of local dairy breeds including the Augeronne, the Cauchoise and the Cotentine (all now extinct) with animals of the Durham breed (later known as the Shorthorn), which were imported from England from 1836 onwards. The French population of the Alderney breed was also absorbed into the Normande. A herd-book was started in 1883. Performance testing for bulls was introduced in 1952. The Normande is a significant breed in France. In the 1960s there were some 4.5 million head, representing about a quarter of the national herd. In 2005 the total number in France was estimated at approximately 2.1 million. The Normande has been exported to many countries and is present on all continents. Exports to South America began in 1877. Colombia has the largest population of Normande cattle outside France, reported at about 380,000.

(8 October 1924 ‚Äì 23 December 2007) was a prominent cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church in Brazil during the 1970s and 1980s. He was renowned as an advocate of liberation theology in the 1970s and was seen by some observers as a serious candidate for the papacy in the two conclaves of 1978. Early life and ordination Lorscheider was of German descent, born in Estrela, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. He entered the local Franciscan minor seminary of Taquari at the age of nine years. He began his novitiate in December 1942 and was ordained as a priest on 22 August 1948. Professor and bishop He taught a number of subjects ‚Äì German, mathematics, Latin ‚Äì but it was not long before he went to Rome to study dogmatic theology. Lorscheider received his doctorate in 1952, and returned to Brazil to teach that same subject at the Franciscan Seminary of Divinopolis. In 1958 Lorscheider was called back to Rome to teach, and in 1962 made bishop of Santo √Çngelo. Lorscheider attended the Second Vatican Council between 1962 and 1965, and he was named Archbishop of Fortaleza in the northeastern state of Cear√° in 1973. Cardinal Cardinal Lorscheider's tomb. As Lorscheider grew in popularity with his flock and his ability as a prelate was recognised, Pope Paul VI gave him a cardinal's hat in May 1976, becoming Cardinal-Priest of S. Pietro in Montorio. Although at the time he was the fourth-youngest cardinal in the college, Lorscheider already doubted his own health. However, some oddsmakers with Ladbrokes (who had him at odds of 33 to 1) considered him a serious papabile in the August 1978 conclave. Lorscheider headed the National Conference of Brazilian Bishops from 1971 to 1978. He led the Latin American Episcopal Conference in 1976. In 1995, Pope John Paul II named Lorscheider Archbishop of Aparecida in S√£o Paulo State. He resigned the pastoral government of the Aparecida archdiocese at the beginning of 2004. It is also thought Lorscheider was one of the most vital supporters of Albino Luciani's rise to the papacy, and also of Karol Wojty≈Ça's in the October 1978 conclave. After the death of John Paul II in 2005, Lorscheider said that the European cardinals' \\"sense of superiority\\" would not allow them to elect a non-European pope. In poor health and ineligible to vote because he was over the age of 80, he did not attend the pre-conclave discussions at the 2005 conclave that elected Joseph Ratzinger to succeed John Paul II. Death He died on 23 December 2007 in Porto Alegre, Brazil after a long hospitalization. Liberation theology He defended Leonardo Boff when that theologian was brought to heel by Joseph Ratzinger in the 1980s, and continued his strong social activism, being jailed briefly in 1993 as a result of participating in a protest against government policy. With the crackdown on dissent in the John Paul II papacy, especially after Cardinal Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) became prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 1981, Lorscheider found himself opposing brother cardinals whom he had been very firmly associated with during the Montini papacy. During his Church career, he developed his outspoken stance on the appalling poverty that blighted the region. He believed that the Church was obliged to take a firm stand against this poverty and his hard-working and personable character allowed him to develop links with the poor that he observed to be lacking in previous generations of priests. He was a vehement critic of Brazil's military dictatorship and its torture of political opponents and favoured a flexible approach to church structure.

His elder brother was the famous artist R. R. R. Dhlomo, and the great Zulu composer, R. T. Caluza, is a near relative. His father, Ezra, was a friend of Bambatha, who led the Bambatha rebellion. Dhlomo himself held many jobs during his short life, but always regarded his literary production as his major achievement: > \\"My creative life is the greatest thing I can give to my people, to Africa. > I am determined to die writing and writing and writing. And no one ‚Ä¶ can > stop, fight or destroy that. It is the soul, the heart and, the spirit. It > will endure and speak truth even if I perish‚Ä¶I have chosen the path to serve > my people by means of literature, and nothing will deflect me from this > course.\\" Biography =Early years= Born in Natal Province, South Africa, Dhlomo was educated in local schools, before training as a teacher at Adams College.Keith A. P. Sandiford, A Black Studies Primer: Heroes and Heroines of the African Diaspora, Hansib Publications, 2008, p. 150. He subsequently taught for some years in Johannesburg. He was very active in social affairs during the 1920s, which resulted in several articles published by him in newspapers such as Ilanga Lase Natal in Durban and Bantu World. =Politics= At the time he also became active for a body called the Bantu Dramatic Society and the ANC. In 1935 he finally left the teaching profession to join the staff of Bantu World. During this time of the 1920s and 1930s the black population in the area strove to emancipate themselves with the help of influential white liberals against the conservative white majority who held all political power. Herbert Dhlomo soon became one of the major figures of the new black elite. The catchphrase of the time was \\"progressive\\" and The African Yearly Register of the time described Dhlomo as \\"a young man of fine personality, very progressive in his ideas\\", which at this time meant that he was open towards the achievements of Western modernity. =Literary career= This Progressivism was part of Dhlomo's earlier writing and centred on Western- style education, \\"civilisation\\", moderation, anti-tribalism etc. Examples of this kind in Dhlomo's writing are The Girl who killed to Save and Ntsikana, which are in the line of Progressivist ideas and justify white policy. Native Africans were supposed to be the junior partners of the whites in politics and literature, a relationship that was supposed to develop eventually into racial equality. The literature they produced was meant for a mission press, and its aim was to keep the political situation quiet rather than to ameliorate it for the blacks. The language of these early writings also reveals the heavy influence of British Victorian and Romantic anthology pieces, which manifests itself in a pompous style, elitism and overawed-ness in the face of British models. The black writer of the time was simply supposed to show his or her cleverness by emulating the great white tradition. =Final years= Having worked as a librarian from 1937 to 1941, he finally became assistant editor of Ilanga Lase Natal in 1943, a position that he held until his death. In addition, he was a prolific playwright and produced many popular dramas including: The Girl Who Killed To Save (1935); Shaka; The Living Dead; Cetywayo; Men and Women; Dingana; Moshoeshoe; Workers Boss Bosses; Ntsikana and Mofologi. As a poet, he often published his work first in Ilanga Lase Natal, and his best known collection, The Valley of a Thousand Hills, was produced in 1941. Literature =Literary style= He increasingly dedicated his life to writing and gradually shifted his position away from progressivism, which seemed not to progress very much, to slightly more radical political viewpoints. A certain bitterness in Dhlomo's writing sets in with the play Cetshwayo in 1936, which was probably due to a resentment of the social control exercised by the white liberals whose ‚Äòsupport‚Äô was increasingly seen as suppression or at least impediment of real social progress. Cetshwayo is a very good example of the difficulties of Dhlomo's style. The play, apart from what critics have called \\"subromantic diction\\", has long novelistic passages that make it difficult as a text for reading and nearly unplayable on the stage. A short passage from Cetshwayo illustrates the turning away from missionary (Christian) thought: in the scene, one tribal warrior has just slain a rival in a duel as a Christian convert comes along the path. The ensuing dialogue pits tribal against missionary ideas of order and illuminates Dhlomo's radicalisation and his bitter break with the Missionary environment that formed him. > Convert: What have you done? > Warrior: Stop that! I don‚Äôt like it! When a person asks about what he knows > and sees, he sees and knows what he does not ask. He is a liar and a fraud, > a spy. > Convert: I am sorry, brother. I do not fight. > Warrior: I know. Christians do not fight. It is not Christian. They cheat, > ruin, feign, find fault and drag people down. > Convert: Surely you are mistaken‚Ä¶ > Warrior: Christian, hold your tongue! Don‚Äôt interrupt me! Look after > yourself. You are nearer death than you think! > Convert: You w-won‚Äôt k-kill me, b-brother! > Warrior: We kill Christians! A Christian is only good dead! Living, he is > either useful and honest or not Christian. (‚Ä¶) What Dhlomo otherwise attempted to produce was a \\"literary drama\\" based on the grand themes of the deeds of past heroes, rather than stage vehicles for immediate political agitation on the stage. This kind of drama Dhlomo wrote rested on the belief that \\"the tragedy of a Job, an Oedipus, a Hamlet, a Joan, a Shaka, a Nongqause, is the tragedy of all countries, all times, all races\\". He thus prefigured many later African writers in the 20th century, such as Wole Soyinka, Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o, Chinua Achebe and many others, whose bi- cultural education and background made them see the parallels between the basic mythical structures that underlie most cultures. =Poetry= Dhlomo also wrote poems ‚Äì mostly published by his brother R. R. R. Dhlomo ‚Äì such as Fired ‚Äì Lines on an African Intellectual being sacked by White Liberals for his independent ideas. Dhlomo's personal grievance coincided with a general trend, strengthened by the nationalistic ideas held by the ANC of the time. The general trend from tutelage to protest, to resistance against political oppression of blacks has its roots in that era and continues to the very day. One of Dhlomo's patriotic and protest poems is On Munro Bridge, Johannesburg, from which the following section was taken to represent Dhlomo's concerns at the time: > (‚Ä¶) Jerusalem can boast no better sight, > For here the veld with glorious scenes is dight. > O sweet miniature Edens of the north! > O glorious homes! Is gold but all your worth? > Shall Belial rule forever in your towers, > Polluting all this beauty, all your hours? > How can you rest content so near the hells > Of poverty where Moloch fiercely dwells; > Where children die of hunger and neglect. > While city Fathers boast suburbs select; > Where minds diseased and dead to Love make gains > Through drunkards, widows, waifs and worker‚Äôs pains (‚Ä¶) =Contemporary writings= During his last years, Dhlomo wrote almost exclusively on contemporary matters, which he sought to render in a dynamic and lively form. The past now informed his writing only where it was supposed to be usable for social comment and action. This work of the 1940s actually exhibits streaks of both Marxism and Nationalism when it talks about the exploitation of black workers and understands itself as a \\"fight with greater confidence to become a citizen of the country of our birth\\", respectively. Legacy As Dhlomo died after a long illness in 1956, his literary oeuvre was already considerable: dozens of plays and short stories, and over one hundred poems complement his regular editorial and political work. Nearly half of his known work, however, has been lost, due to writer's relatively long obscurity amongst other African writers better known today. Dhlomo was nevertheless a key figure among the early generation of writers, including Sol Plaatje and Thomas Mofolo, who established a literary tradition for the more recent generation(s) to build on.

History Wood was born in Mansfield to a lawyer James Riddall Wood and Hannah Healy Weaver. His father remarried Mary Haygarth and emigrated to Durban, and John, who had spent seven years at sea after leaving school, joined him there in 1852. He soon acquired his own property at the mouth of the Umdhloti River north of Durban. Here he experimented with new crop plants. In 1855 he married his stepmother's younger sister Elizabeth Haygarth. http://plants.jstor.org/stable/10.5555/al.ap.person.bm000009410 For health reasons he moved further inland to Inanda in 1868, where he ran a trading store and did some farming. Here he developed an interest in cryptogams and started collecting ferns, mosses and fungi as well as flowering plants. He began corresponding with M.C. Cooke and K√°roly Kalchbrenner, the mycologists at Kew and in Budapest, Hungary. The Rev. John Buchanan, a local fern expert who had published a list of Natal ferns in 1875, assisted Medley Wood in that group. In 1880 Anton Rehmann, the Austrian botanist, visited Natal and took over Wood's collection of mosses. As a result of his growing interest in botany, he accepted the post of curator of the Durban Botanic Gardens in 1882. From his interest in crop plants, he established the suitability of Uba sugar cane (Saccharum sinense L.), for conditions in Natal. During these years he collected plants extensively throughout Natal and exchanged duplicates with foreign herbaria. He was preparing the seventh volume of his Natal Plants at the time of his death in 1915. He is commemorated in the genera Woodia Schltr., Woodiella Sydow and a large number of species names including that of Encephalartos woodii Sander, which he first discovered.

H. & Howe, J. A. G. (1979). Thomson Elm. Canadian Journal of Plant Science 59:1159Schroeder, W. (1994). Genetic improvement for prairie tree plantings. Journal of Arboriculture. 20(1), Jan. 1994. . The tree was one of a number of Japanese Elms planted in an experimental shelterbelt at Indian Head in 1953. These shelterbelt trees were derived from seed taken from two openly pollinated Japanese Elms obtained from Manchuria and planted at Indian Head in 1929. 'Thomson' attained a height of 8 m in 25 years, a rather modest performance compared with Siberian Elm Ulmus pumila and American Elm Ulmus americana grown at the same site. Nevertheless, the tree has proved exceptionally hardy. Description 'Thomson' is distinguished by a single trunk bearing a vase-shaped crown, the branches forming strong wide-angled crotches; the bark is dark grey and deeply fissured. The twigs have diamond- shaped fissures that become more apparent on second-year wood, and occasionally sport corky wings. The leaves are borne on 1 cm petioles, and average 7.5 cm in length, obovate to elliptic, with the typical acuminate apex and oblique base; dark green and glabrous, they turn bright yellow in autumn. The samarae are obovate and deeply notched at the apex. The species does not sucker from roots. Pests and diseases 'Thomson' displayed a resistance to Dutch elm disease when inoculated by Dr E. S. Kondo of the Canadian Forest Service (CFS) in Sault Ste. Marie; the original tree still survives (2008) and has also proven resistant to elm leaf beetle Xanthogaleruca luteola. Moreover, the tree's foliage was adjudged \\"resistant\\" to Black Spot by the Plant Diagnostic Clinic of the University of Missouri . Cultivation The tree was usually propagated by grafting on Siberian Elm seedlings. Released for sale in Saskatchewan in 1980, 'Thomson' is no longer in commerce owing to restrictions imposed by the Canadian government on the movement of elms across the country, which severely limited its potential market. 'Thomson' was never introduced to Europe or Australasia. Synonymy *'Thompson': In error for 'Thomson'. Etymology The tree was named for Mr W. B. Thomson, appointed director of PFRA in 1973.

However, she thinks that S-E-X is a sin and does not want the word to be mentioned during the film. The Goodies respond with an absurdly coy film (\\"How to Make Babies by Doing Dirty Things\\") that could not possibly offend anyone, but the use of the word 'gender' in the opening credits disgusts her to such an extent that she refuses to watch the rest of the film and begins legal proceedings, at which point The Goodies learn that her husband \\"keeps his distance\\". The Goodies are then publicly attacked by everyone. To improve their image, they abduct a notorious MP and take his place on a chat show. Upon being uncovered, they learn the BBC's policy and are asked to make violent films for the BBC; Tim and Graeme are horrified about this and refuse the request, but Bill decides to do so and releases a string of violent films, including a very violent version of Cinderella, called Sinderella.

Lindstr√∂m quantifiers generalize first-order quantifiers, such as the existential quantifier, the universal quantifier, and the counting quantifiers. They were introduced by Per Lindstr√∂m in 1966. They were later studied for their applications in logic in computer science and database query languages. Generalization of first-order quantifiers In order to facilitate discussion, some notational conventions need explaining. The expression : \\\\phi^{A,x,\\\\bar{a}}=\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in A\\\\colon A\\\\models\\\\phi[x,\\\\bar{a}]\\\\\\\\} for A an L-structure (or L-model) in a language L, œÜ an L-formula, and \\\\bar{a} a tuple of elements of the domain dom(A) of A. In other words, \\\\phi^{A,x,\\\\bar{a}} denotes a (monadic) property defined on dom(A). In general, where x is replaced by an n-tuple \\\\bar{x} of free variables, \\\\phi^{A,\\\\bar{x},\\\\bar{a}} denotes an n-ary relation defined on dom(A). Each quantifier Q_A is relativized to a structure, since each quantifier is viewed as a family of relations (between relations) on that structure. For a concrete example, take the universal and existential quantifiers ‚àÄ and ‚àÉ, respectively. Their truth conditions can be specified as : A\\\\models\\\\forall x\\\\phi[x,\\\\bar{a}] \\\\iff \\\\phi^{A,x,\\\\bar{a}}\\\\in\\\\forall_A : A\\\\models\\\\exists x\\\\phi[x,\\\\bar{a}] \\\\iff \\\\phi^{A,x,\\\\bar{a}}\\\\in\\\\exists_A, where \\\\forall_A is the singleton whose sole member is dom(A), and \\\\exists_A is the set of all non-empty subsets of dom(A) (i.e. the power set of dom(A) minus the empty set). In other words, each quantifier is a family of properties on dom(A), so each is called a monadic quantifier. Any quantifier defined as an n > 0-ary relation between properties on dom(A) is called monadic. Lindstr√∂m introduced polyadic ones that are n > 0-ary relations between relations on domains of structures. Before we go on to Lindstr√∂m's generalization, notice that any family of properties on dom(A) can be regarded as a monadic generalized quantifier. For example, the quantifier \\"there are exactly n things such that...\\" is a family of subsets of the domain of a structure, each of which has a cardinality of size n. Then, \\"there are exactly 2 things such that œÜ\\" is true in A iff the set of things that are such that œÜ is a member of the set of all subsets of dom(A) of size 2\\\\. A Lindstr√∂m quantifier is a polyadic generalized quantifier, so instead being a relation between subsets of the domain, it is a relation between relations defined on the domain. For example, the quantifier Q_A x_1 x_2 y_1 z_1 z_2 z_3(\\\\phi(x_1 x_2),\\\\psi(y_1),\\\\theta(z_1 z_2 z_3)) is defined semantically as : A\\\\models Q_Ax_1x_2y_1z_1z_2z_3(\\\\phi,\\\\psi,\\\\theta)[a] \\\\iff (\\\\phi^{A,x_1x_2,\\\\bar{a}},\\\\psi^{A,y_1,\\\\bar{a}},\\\\theta^{A,z_1z_2z_3,\\\\bar{a}})\\\\in Q_A where : \\\\phi^{A,\\\\bar{x},\\\\bar{a}}=\\\\\\\\{(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n)\\\\in A^n\\\\colon A\\\\models\\\\phi[\\\\bar{x},\\\\bar{a}]\\\\\\\\} for an n-tuple \\\\bar{x} of variables. Lindstr√∂m quantifiers are classified according to the number structure of their parameters. For example Qxy\\\\phi(x)\\\\psi(y) is a type (1,1) quantifier, whereas Qxy\\\\phi(x,y) is a type (2) quantifier. An example of type (1,1) quantifier is Hartig's quantifier testing equicardinality, i.e. the extension of {A, B ‚äÜ M: A = B}. An example of a type (4) quantifier is the Henkin quantifier.  Expressiveness hierarchy  The first result in this direction was obtained by Lindstr√∂m (1966) who showed that a type (1,1) quantifier was not definable in terms of a type (1) quantifier. After Lauri Hella (1989) developed a general technique for proving the relative expressiveness of quantifiers, the resulting hierarchy turned out to be lexicographically ordered by quantifier type: ::(1) < (1, 1) < . . . < (2) < (2, 1) < (2, 1, 1) < . . . < (2, 2) < . . . (3) < . . . For every type t, there is a quantifier of that type that is not definable in first-order logic extended with quantifiers that are of types less than t.  As precursors to Lindstr√∂m's theorem  Although Lindstr√∂m had only partially developed the hierarchy of quantifiers which now bear his name, it was enough for him to observe that some nice properties of first-order logic are lost when it is extended with certain generalized quantifiers. For example, adding a \\"there exist finitely many\\" quantifier results in a loss of compactness, whereas adding a \\"there exist uncountably many\\" quantifier to first-order logic results in a logic no longer satisfying the L√∂wenheim‚ÄìSkolem theorem.

It was established by the passing of the Family Court Act (WA, 1975) and commenced operation in 1976. It is a state Family Court under section 41 of the Commonwealth Family Law Act 1975, and deals with the same issues as the Commonwealth Family Court, including divorce, marital property settlements, and child custody, and also adoption and surrogacy. Although funded by the Commonwealth Government, it is the only state-based family court in Australia. The reason for the creation of the court as a state court was to bestow additional jurisdiction related to family law on the court, which were beyond the scope of federal power, such as de facto arrangements and adoptions.  Structure  Western Australia is unique amongst Australian states in being the only state with its own Family Court. Family law matters in all other states are dealt with by two federal Courts - the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court. The Family Court of Western Australia is an integrated court, in that it combines the functions of a superior court and a lower court. Officially, the Family Court is two courts in one - the Family Court itself (constituted by its Judges) and a Magistrates Court (constituted by Family Law Magistrates). Its Magistrates' division is officially differentiated from the main Magistrates Court of Western Australia by being referred to as the 'Magistrates Court at 150 Terrace Rd Perth'. Section 41 of the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) permitted a state to establish its own Family Court. The Family Court of Western Australia was established by the Family Court Act 1975 (WA) (later repealed and replaced by the Family Court Act 1997 (WA)). In the second reading speech of the 1975 bill the Minister for Works, Des O'Neil, referred to a number of reasons the Western Australian Government preferred to keep a state-based Family Court (rather than referring family law matters to a Commonwealth court). These included concerns over the demarcation of federal and state jurisdiction and its effect on litigants, that the Court could exercise related state jurisdiction, and to \\"keep the justice system as close to the people of the state\\" as possible without the need to establish a Commonwealth court.Western Australia, Parliamentary Debates, Legislative Assembly, 21 October 1975, 3605-6 (Des O'Neil) In 2008, the federal Attorney- General announced a review of the delivery of family law services by the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Magistrates Court. A November 2008 report set out a possible framework of governance options to achieve a more integrated system of case management practices across the federal family law jurisdiction, with changes in judicial structures and reporting relationships. According to the report, all review submissions, with the exception of that provided by the Federal Magistrates' Court, \\"considered that the most effective model for the delivery by the Courts of family law services would be a single family court, with two separate judicial divisions serviced by a single administration.\\" The proposed federal model is similar to that of the Family Court of Western Australia, which the Law Council of Australia, in its submission, had noted as \\"providing a useful model of the structure and functioning of an integrated Family Court\\". The Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia, Diana Bryant, in her submission, also favoured a single integrated federal family court structured similarly to the Family Court of Western Australia. = Funding = Under the terms of a 1976 agreement signed by Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and the State Premier Sir Charles Court, the Commonwealth government provides almost all funding for the operation of the Family Court of WA. The Western Australian government issues an invoice to the Commonwealth, on a quarterly basis, for the cost of operations, and receives payment from the Commonwealth. In 2007-08, the Court's operating budget was approximately $17m, $10.6m of which was for staff and judicial salaries. In that financial year, expenditure exceeded budget by $1.27m and by July 2008, the Court was carrying a cash deficit position of almost $200,000. Although a State Court, the Family Court of Western Australia is located within the Commonwealth Court complex, which houses the Federal Court of Australia in Perth. The Court leases part of the building from the Commonwealth. Court security is provided as part of the lease arrangement.  Jurisdiction  For married people who want to divorce and make arrangements for children, property and spousal maintenance, proceedings in the Family Court of Western Australia are held under the Family Law Act 1975 (Commonwealth), which is federal legislation. For unmarried people who seek arrangements for children, property and maintenance, the Court proceedings are held under the Family Court Act of 1997 (Western Australia) which is state legislation. In 2002, the legislation was amended to incorporate de facto relationships and their property matters. = Adoption = Elsewhere in Australia, the legal aspects of adoption are dealt with either in the Supreme or District Courts of each state and territory. In Western Australia, the Family Court of Western Australia is responsible for the approval of adoption applications in the state. Judges of the court make adoption orders and other related orders, and the court then issues the appropriate orders. The court also releases information from past adoption cases at the request of the Department for Community Development. Officers at the court coordinate the processing of adoption applications and release of information as well as answering enquiries from the public. = Surrogacy = The Family Court of Western Australia has jurisdiction under the Western Australian Surrogacy Act 2008. Judges of the court may make parentage orders and other related orders. A parentage order transfers the parentage of a child from his or her surrogate birth parent/s to the child‚Äôs arranged parents. The arranged parents then become the child‚Äôs legal parents. After commencement of the Surrogacy Act 2008 on 1 March 2009, any person wishing to enter into a surrogacy arrangement must comply with all the procedures set out under the Act and Regulations if they propose to apply to the Family Court of WA for a parentage order. If a child is conceived through a surrogacy arrangement before the Act came into effect, an application may be made to the Family Court of WA for a parentage order provided the application is brought within 12 months of the child‚Äôs birth and all the requirements set out in the Act have been met.  Judicial Officers  The Court is presided over by five judges, ten magistrates, and four sole judicial registrars. = Chief Judge = *The Honourable Justice Gail Sutherland (appointed 7 January 2019) = Judges = *The Honourable Justice Simon Moncrieff (appointed 31 August 2009) *The Honourable Justice Susan Duncanson (appointed 6 December 2012) *The Honourable Justice Richard O'Brien *Her Honour Judge Ciara Tyson (appointed 7 January 2019) All the Court's judges, apart from Her Honour Judge Ciara Tyson, hold dual commissions; on appointment to office, they are also appointed to the Family Court of Australia. In addition to their judicial role in relation to family law matters, Judges of the Family Court of WA are often required after hours and on weekends to determine applications under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act from law enforcement agencies, relating to authorisations for carrying out telephone surveillance activities. In 2005 there were 153 such applications. = Family Law Magistrates = As at 8 January 2019, the Magistrates of the Court are: *Magistrate Annette Andrews (Acting Principal Registrar) *Magistrate Lisa Stewart *Magistrate Francine Walter *Magistrate Mark Calverley *Magistrate Colin Kaeser *Magistrate Catherine Osborn *Magistrate Eric Martino *Magistrate Paul Glass *Magistrate Neil Anderson *Magistrate Andrew Mackey = Registrars = *Registrar Leonie Forrest (Principal Registrar) *Registrar Andrzej Meysner *Registrar Jocelyn Connick *Registrar Thomas Kuurstra *Registrar Simon French *Registrar Megan Wadsworth See also * Australian family law References External links * Category:1976 establishments in Australia Category:Western Australian courts and tribunals Category:Australian family law Category:Courthouses in Perth, Western Australia Western Australia Category:Courts and tribunals established in 1976 ","title":"Family Court of Western Australia"},{"id":"8030702","title":"Ban Chang District"},{"id":"8030706","text":"St John's College, Cambridge Formal Hall Formal Hall or Formal Meal is a meal held at some of the oldest universities in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland (as well as some other Commonwealth countries) at which students usually dress in formal attire and often gowns to dine. These are held commonly in the colleges and halls of Oxford,Formal Hall Etiquette , Jesus College, Oxford, UK. Cambridge,Meals & Formal Hall, Trinity Hall, Cambridge, UK. Dublin, Durham, St Andrews, Bristol, London, the Australian sandstone universities (Adelaide, Melbourne, Queensland, Sydney, Tasmania, Western Australia), and Toronto. In a number of red brick universities, some halls such as those at Bristol, Leeds and Exeter, also practise similar traditions in order to increase interaction between academics and students, and to enrich the students' overall learning experience. Colleges of some Australian red brick universities, including the Australian National University, Monash University, the University of New England, the University of New South Wales and the University of Southern Queensland, also hold gowned formal dinners. The nature of Formals varies widely between the colleges and halls that hold them. In some colleges, Formals may be held every night, and are simply a second sitting of hall at which gowns are worn and grace is read. In other colleges, Formals may be special events to which guests from outside the college are frequently invited, often with themes and associated ents or \\"bops\\". In between these two extremes fall the great majority of colleges.  Terminology  The full name and abbreviations to describe the formals differ. Generally, though, they are known as: * Formal Hall - common at Oxford, Cambridge, Royal Holloway and Durham * Formal Meal or Formal Dinner - are also sometimes used * Common Meal - subsidized collegiate meals at St Andrews * Commons - Dublin (Trinity College) * High Table - Trinity College and Massey College in the University of Toronto. Abbreviations of the above terms tend to be either Formal or, at St John's College, Cambridge, Hall. There are other circumstances in which different names are used. For example, some larger colleges have both a large dining hall and a canteen-style dining room (often called the Buttery or Servery). In these cases informal evening meals are taken in the Buttery and formal meals in the hall, and the term Hall is used uniquely to refer to the latter meal. Some may call it Second Hall to differentiate from the earlier self-service First Hall or Informal Hall.  Traditions  Some colleges/halls have elaborate traditions, while others are more relaxed. Grace may be said before the meal, in some places in Latin. A dress code of academic gowns at formals is compulsory at some colleges; in other cases formal wear (for example a lounge suit for men or equivalent for women) is required in addition to, or instead of, the gown.

A variation of the tradition is found at University College, Durham, where corks are used instead of pennies. In some Cambridge colleges, Smarties are used as an alternative, due to the request of the kitchen staff (pennies apparently being a problem in dishwashers). Almost all Bristol, Durham, St Andrews, Royal Holloway, Dublin, Oxford and Cambridge college formal halls include a High Table, exclusively for the Senior Common Room of the college and their guests, with students eating at the lower tables. The high table is often raised above the floor level of the hall, on a dais. Some of the newer colleges (e.g. Wolfson College, Cambridge, Wolfson College, Oxford, Linacre College, Oxford) have discontinued or have never had this practice, in order to promote equality between fellows and students.

Crime Does Not Pay is the title of an American comic book series published between 1942 and 1955 by Lev Gleason Publications. Edited and chiefly written by Charles Biro, the title launched the crime comics genre and was the first \\"true crime\\" comic book series. At the height of its popularity, Crime Does Not Pay would claim a readership of six million on its covers. The series' sensationalized recountings of the deeds of gangsters such as Baby Face Nelson and Machine Gun Kelly were illustrated by artists Bob Wood, George Tuska, and others. Stories were often introduced and commented upon by \\"Mr. Crime\\", a ghoulish figure in a top hat, and the precursor of \\"horror hosts\\" such as EC Comics' Crypt Keeper. According to Gerard Jones, Crime Does Not Pay was \\"the first nonhumor comic to rival the superheroes in sales, the first to open the comic book market to large numbers of late adolescent and young males.\\"Jones 194 Origin When Lev Gleason hired Bob Wood and Charles Biro to edit Daredevil and Silver Streak comics in 1941, he rewarded the two cartoonists with a profit-sharing program and creator credits on the covers of the comics. In addition, Gleason urged the pair to create new titles for his company under the understanding that they would share in the profits. Biro and Wood discussed the matter and eventually came up with a concept that would become Crime Does Not Pay, a comic book series chronicling the lives of murderers and gangsters based in part on real world people. Biro is reputed to have been inspired by a meeting with a kidnapper and pimp one night in a bar,Wright 26 although publisher Arthur Bernhard has stated that the entire concept was created by Gleason.Goulart 231 The title was based on a popular radio and MGM film series. First issues Heralded by ads in other Gleason tiles, Crime Does Not Pay took over the numbering of Silver Streak comics with issue 22 cover dated July 1942. The first issue featured articles and comic stories about real criminals and was written by Biro and Wood. Biro designed and drew the first cover and wrote stories about mobsters Louis Buchalter and \\"Diamond Joe\\" Esposito, and gunfighter Wild Bill Hickok. Initial issues sold approximately 200,000 copies each, a healthy number for the time, but by the end of World War II the title was selling 800,000 per issue. When sales reached one million in 1948, the editors added the claim \\"More Than 5,000,000 Readers Monthly\\" to the cover, a reference to the pass-along effect of comics circulation.Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #163, Comic Book Resources, July 10, 2008 Content Mostly written by Charles Biro, the stories in Crime Does Not Pay became known for their lurid detail, confessional tone, and exceptional, violent artwork. The stories often dealt frankly with adult relationships, drug use and sex, in addition to the depictions of physical violence, torture, and murder that were standard for every issue. Recurring features included \\"Officer Common Sense\\", beginning with issue 41, \\"Chip Gardner\\", issue 22, and \\"Who Dunnit\\", puzzle mystery series with art by Fred Guardineer, beginning with issue 39. Mr. Crime Issue 24 introduced the Biro-designed figure of Mr. Crime, the cartoon mascot of the series, who narrated and commented on the action depicted in the comics, addressing his readers in a joking, conspiratorial tone. Mr. Crime dressed in a white top hat (labeled \\"Crime\\") and white sheet. His bizarre visage resembled a gremlin, with pointed ears, nose and teeth. In many ways he was similar to the character of Mr. Coffee Nerves from a series of print ads for Postum designed by cartoonists Milt Caniff and Noel Sickles. The character of Mr. Crime pre- dated the Horror Hosts of EC Comics and other publishers, and his ghostly presence is very similar to that effected by Rod Serling on The Twilight Zone television series and of Raymond Edward Johnson on the Inner Sanctum radio program. Mr. Crime's attitude toward the tales he narrated was ambivalent at best. In some panels he seemed to approve of and even encourage the crimes of a story's miscreants (acting as a sort of anti-conscience, invisible to the characters), while in others he was openly contemptuous of criminals, rarely failing, as the story's protagonists met their end in the denouement, to remind readers that, as the title indicated, \\"Crime Does Not Pay\\". Other crime comics Justice Traps the Guilty number 7 (leftThe series remained essentially alone in its choice of subject matter for most of the 1940s but eventually inspired a host of imitators, including Jack Kirby and Joe Simon's Headline Comics and Real Clue for Hillman Periodicals (1947), Marvel's Official True Crime Cases (1947), DC's Gang Busters (1947), and Fox's Crimes by Women (1948). In response, Gleason and Biro ran attack ads in their own comics and launched a companion title to Crime Does Not Pay, called Crime and Punishment, in 1948. However, 1948 also saw more publishers enter the genre, with the result that, by one estimate \\"thirty different crime comics were on the stands by the end of 1948 and by 1949 roughly one in seven comics was a crime comics.\\"Wright 58 Demise Although continuously popular in terms of sales, Crime Does Not Pay and other crime comics increasingly became the targets of concerned parents, clergy, and other groups who were disturbed by the content of the comics and saw the stories as one of the root causes of a variety of societal ills, including illiteracy and juvenile delinquency. In the wake of books such as Dr. Fredric Wertham's Seduction of the Innocent and the investigations of the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency, many publishers, including Lev Gleason, censored their own comics and adopted a strict code administered by the Comics Code Authority. The sanitized Crime Does Not Pay that resulted lasted only a few issues before being canceled with issue #147 in 1955. Spinoffs The success of CDNP inspired Gleason and company to release Crime and Punishment which ran from 1948 until 1954. The series ran for 74 issues and was primarily overseen by the same creative team from CDNP, Charles Biro and Bob Wood. The series differed from CDNP in that it featured less violent editorial content and featured stories that more prominently depicted police officers. The series' ghostly narrator, instead of the ghoulish Mr. Crime, was a policeman killed in the line of duty. Reprints In Fall 2011, Dark Horse Comics published a collection called Blackjacked and Pistol-Whipped: A Crime Does Not Pay Primer which went on to become nominated for a 2012 Harvey Award (for Best Domestic Reprint Project). Also in 2012, Dark Horse began a complete archives series of the original hard-to-find Crime Does Not Pay issues. This ongoing series was nominated for an Eisner Award for Best Archival Collection/Project in 2013 with 10 volumes released. Dark Horse has scuttled plans to continue the line, although Volumes 11 and 12 were announced but never published.  References   Further reading  *Goulart, Ron. Great History of Comic Books.

It has distinctive colouring, with chestnut-brown sides and white back and underside. It was in the past a triple-purpose breed, raised for meat, milk and draught use. There is a naturally polled sub-type, the Jochberg Hummel. In 2007 the breed was not considered by the FAO to be at risk. History According to genetic and morphological studies, the Pinzgauer cattle breed is most closely related to North German lowland breeds. The Pinzgauer was first referred to as a breed in 1846, and prior to this called \\"Pinzgauer Fasel\\" or \\"Pinzgauer Schlag\\". In the 19th century, they were bred into strong stock for work on farms, at breweries, and in sugar-beet areas. In its heyday, the Pinzgauer became the most popular cattle breed in Austria-Hungary, subsequently expanding through Eastern Europe. The Bavarian Pinzgauer Cattle Breeding Association was founded in 1896. By December 1890, the Pinzgauer population had grown to 101,880 in Bavaria, but it eventually collapsed as a result of industrialization after World War I. Demand for the cattle decreased, and the breed was replaced by better milk-producing breeds such as Fleckvieh cattle. By 1930, Bavaria had only 85,000 Pingzauer cattle. A naturally polled type, the Jochberger Hummel, was considered a separate breed until 1997, when it was merged into the Pinzgauer herd book. These cattle descend from a single, almost totally white calf that was born in 1834 in Tyrol. They were considered crippled and useless because they could not put on a yoke. Now Pinzgauer are not yoked, and the hornless breed is well adapted to modern husbandry. There are now fewer than 50 hornless Pinzgauer cattle in the world, so the type is endangered. Since 1988, there have only been two hornless bulls at the insemination station near Salzburg. Characteristics The animals are auburn in colour. A luscious chestnut-colour is the breeding target. Black animals have occurred, but rarely, and were once seen as a curse. After 1900, black bulls were removed from the breeding system, and the black colour vanished. All Pinzgauers have the typical finched pattern in common: a broad white stripe lengthwise along the whole back. The abdomen, chest, udder, and tail are white as well. The weight of cows ranges from , and cows average in height. Bull weight ranges from , and bull height is on average. Pinzgauer cows at a fair in the US Population and performance The Pinzgauer breed is considered endangered, and the population decreases about 10% per year. In 2001 there were 36,000 animals in Germany, and worldwide there were around 1.3 million. In Austria in 1995 there were 53,874 animals, 9,883 of which were registered in stud books. Two conflicting tendencies caused the current rarity of purebred, high-performance animals. The Pinzgauer is mainly bred as a beef suckler cow, so there is no selection on milk performance. However, there are utility crossings with local or distinct beef breeds, too. In Austria itself, since 1969, Red Holstein have been crossed into Pinzgauer to increase the milk performance. The aim is to achieve 6,000 kg milk with 4% milk fat content and 3.5% protein. The average milk performance in Austria is 5,356 kg milk with 3.89% milk fat and 3.28% protein (2005).

Muhammad Sayyid was Nawab of Arcot, who was a younger son (heir apparent) of Safdar Ali Khan. Life After the assassination of Safdar Ali Khan in 1742, Murtaza Ali Khan claimed for himself the Nawabship of the Arcot (Carnatic), Chanda Sahib who was taken prisoner to Satara by Maratha leader Raghoji Bhonsle had managed to obtain his freedom after rigorous negotiations, also supported the claims of Murtaza Ali. However, the British East India Company at Madras firmly supported Muhammad Sayyid and proclaimed him as the Nawab of Arcot. At the same time, Nizam ul Mulk Asaf Jah I came with a strong force and settled the claim in favor of Muhammad Sayyid. But as he was a minor, he placed Anwaruddin Khan as Regent, 28 March 1743. During this period, Richard Benyon, the Governor of Fort St. George obtained the Nawab's firman in 1743 granting the villages of Perambur, Sadiankuppam, Ernavore, Pudubakkam and Vepery. However, Muhammad Sayyid, was as unfortunate as his father. He was murdered in July 1744 at Arcot. So, with him, the first dynasty of the Nawabs of Arcot came to an end and as a result Anwaruddin Khan was confirmed in his position as Nawab by Nizam ul Mulk Asaf Jah I. Expedition against the Maratha Outraged by the Maratha occupation of the territories of the Nawab of the Carnatic, Asaf Jah I led an expedition to liberate the Carnatic he was joined by Sadatullah Khan II and Anwaruddin Khan together they recaptured Arcot and initiated the Siege of Trichinopoly (1743), which lasted five months and forced the Marathas led by Murari Rao Ghorpade to evacuate the Carnatic.

The book relates the management succession and increasingly unorthodox ethos of Semco, which grew to become one of Brazil's largest conglomerates. First published in Brazil in 1988 as Turning the Tables, it became the all-time best-selling nonfiction book in Brazil's history. Semler further described the unusual corporate transition in The Seven-Day Weekend: Changing the Way Work Works published in 2003. Synopsis Maverick! is the autobiography of a businessman, Ricardo Semler, and the business he managed, Semco, one of Brazil's largest conglomerates. Semler is the son of an entrepreneur who entered the family business and transformed it into a multibillion-dollar business empire. What is unusual is the way he developed management, labour relations and the work environment to achieve these goals. His radical policies are summed up as cartoons in a 'Semco Lexicon' and a 'Survival Manual' for the employees. Starting out as a manufacturing company, Semco allowed its workers to set their own production quotas and found that employees would voluntarily work overtime to meet them. Profit sharing is practiced right down to factory floor level, instead of large bonuses only for senior management. The company seeks to streamline and simplify processes and avoid complicated business regulations. Semler created an environment, which can essentially work without him and it made Maverick! into a worldwide bestseller. Semco Lexicon Bosses: Greater work participation led to a decrease in supervisors by 75%. Corporate staff offering accounting, marketing and legal expertise was reduced to the manufacturing units, while the quality control, processing and training departments were eradicated. Circular Organization: The former hierarchical twelve-layer bureaucracy was changed into three concentric circle layers. Counsellors form the inner circle and manage the general policies and strategies of the company. Partners form the second level and run the business units. Co-ordinators represent the first- level of management of each unit and Associates are all other employees of the company, together they form the outer circle. Clean-outs: Semco shuts down twice a year, when all employees together have to clean-out their work place, to dispose old documents and machinery. Corruption: There is no tolerance whatsoever for corruption. Democracy: Representative democracy takes place through the factory committees, while for important decisions each employee has one direct vote. Factory Committees: Each business unit of Semco (except the management) elects representatives to serve on committees, while it is ensured that the workers‚Äô union is also included. The committees meet with the top managers of each unit on a regular basis in order to discuss work-related policies and aspects of management with the right to audit the books, declare strikes and question management methods. Family Silverware: In case of a new job opening a Semco employee who fulfils 70% of the requirements is treated preferentially over applicants. Flexitime: There are no fixed working hours at all, each worker decides in his work group on the best schedule. Headline Memo: Memos are titled with a newspaper-like headline and limited to one page. Hepatitis Leave: It describes the idea of sabbaticals at Semco, where managers were originally asked to consider the case of contracting hepatitis and being forced to a two-month recuperation time. Professionals can take off a few weeks or months every year or two from their usual duties to learn new skills, redesign their job or simply recharge. Job Rotation: Managers are encouraged to change jobs, while 25% make use of it. A minimum of two years and a maximum of five years are the norm, while this eventually all depends on the employees. Job Security: There is no promise on job security. Lost in Space: It is a programme by Semco, where in a good business year several young people are hired for one year at the entry level. There are no fixed job descriptions, with the only obligation of working in 12 departments in the first 12 months, while possible job offers are negotiated with the departments. Management by Wandering Around: Department mixing is encouraged, which leads to almost no walls between offices and mixed departments between floors. Manufacturing Cells: Production teams of workers cluster together to a complete scale giving workers greater autonomy and responsibility, which resulted in greater happiness and productivity. Often they set production quotas and develop improvements for products autonomously and overall in Natural Business: As a guiding principle everybody should concentrate on the corporate skills of making, selling, billing and collecting. Hence, unnecessary perks such as preference parking, executive dining rooms, fancy office furniture etc. are eliminated. Nucleus of technological innovation: A small group of mostly engineers without any daily duties free to invent new products, refine old ones, devise market strategies, unearth cost reductions and efficiencies and invent new business lines. Compensation depends partially on their entrepreneurial success. Paternalism: Employees are not treated like children, but as adults. Hence, everybody is free to choose according to his own interests, while the company is only concerned with job performance, not personal life. For example, health insurance and other benefits are offered but managed by employees, while pools, gyms and sports tracks are not included. Profit-sharing: The basic percentage to share is agreed upon between Semco and its employees. These are more or less 25%, whose distribution to each worker is organized autonomously. Reverse Evaluation: Anybody who is hired or promoted must be interviewed, evaluated and promoted by all the people who will work for him. Semco managers are evaluated every 6 months by those he supervises through a special custom multiple choice questionnaire, while the results are made transparent. The average approval rate lays around 80/100 with those scoring below more than three times mostly leaving the company. Risk salary: In order to have fluctuating labour costs with losses and profits, about a third of the employees may have a fluctuating salary by 25% according to the performance of Semco in that year. If the company performs well, they receive 125% of their normal salary and vice versa. Rules: No dress codes, no regulation on travels, no working hours, no internal auditing department, no preference parking places. The rule is to use common sense and have as few rules as possible. Salary surveys: Semco asks their factory and office workers to visit comparable manufacturing companies and interview their counterparts. Thus, no one distrusts the surveys and there is no need for off-the shelf surveys, ultimately creating more trust in the process and findings. The ultimate goal is to have all employees set their own salary. Satellite Programme: Contracting basic manufacturing by encouraging Semco's own workers to found their own company that can also sell to competitors. They are supported through favourable leasing conditions for production machines, as well as advised on pricing, quality and taxation. Self-Set Pay: Around 25% of all employees set their own salaries, which is continued to spread throughout the entire company. Size: A business unit can only function efficiently, if people know almost everyone around them. Hence, they are generally split when they grow above 150 people to diminish alienation and foster co-operation. Strikes: The following rules are followed during a strike: \\"1) treat everyone as adults; 2) tell the strikers that no one will be punished when they return; 3) don‚Äôt keep the records of who came to work and who led the walkout; 4) never call the police or try to break up a picket line; 5) maintain all benefits; 6) don‚Äôt keep workers or union leaders out of the factory; 7) insist that everyone respects the rights of those who want to work; 8) don‚Äôt fire anyone during or after the strike.\\" Support Staff: At Semco everyone copies, faxes, phones and picks-up his guests himself, as secretary jobs have been taken off the payroll. Training: Instead of formal training programmes, employees are asked to envision their future and are then supported to gain these qualifications through training, which is approved at the weekly business unit meetings. Transparency: All corporate information is publicly available, such as statistics on salaries, strategies, productivity and profitability. Employees are taught to read financial documents, question managers and talk with the media freely. Work at home: It is allowed and encouraged, as it enhances concentration, productivity and peoples personal flexibility. Survival Manual Authority: Many positions bear authority, yet any sort of negative pressure, fear, insecurity or disrespect caused by exploiting authority is intolerable. Change: Semco changes a lot, it's a key characteristic considered to be healthy and positive, so do not fear change. Clothing and Appearance: Feel free to wear whatever you want. Evaluation by Subordinates: Twice a year you will be asked to evaluate your boss, be frank and honest on paper and also in the following discussion. Factory Committees: The factory represents the interest of each business unit. Read the charter, participate, make sure your committee effectively defends your interest ‚Äì which many times will not coincide with Semco's interests. See this conflict as healthy and necessary. Hiring: Prior to hiring and promoting, other employees in the unit interview and evaluate candidates. Job Security and Age: Anyone who has been at Semco for three years or is above 50 enjoys special protection, making a long list of approvals necessary, which offers security. Still, everybody can be laid-off. Participation: The companies philosophy is built on participation and involvement. Engage, give opinions, seek advancement, participate in elections, get in touch with the factory committee, don't just be another employee. Private Life: A person's private affairs have nothing to do with the company and therefore are of no interest to Semco, given that they do not interfere with work. If help is required, the Human Resource department offers consulting and advice. Organizational Chart: There is no formal organization chart, as leaders have to earn prior respect to be in their position. In case of utter necessity, the company structure is sketched and afterwards dispensed. Semco Woman: Semco has various programmes to encourage female participation, as they have lower promotion, employment and financial opportunities in Brazil. If you are a woman, participate and if you are a man, understand and respect it. Strikes: Workers‚Äô assemblies are sovereign; as such strikes are part of Semco's democracy representing what people in the company feel and think. Absence from work because of strike is considered normal absenteeism. Suggestions: There are no prizes or rewards for suggestions, as they are an integral part of our business culture. Unions: Everybody's free to unionize, as they are important to protect our workers. We insist on mutual respect or dialogue, forbidding persecution of union members in any way. Vacations: Everybody should take his 30 days of vacation every year, they are vital to recover health and recharge. There is no excuse for not using vacation days. Working Environment: Feel free to change the environment surrounding you, according to your preferences and those who surround you at work. Working Hours: The responsibility for setting working hours and fulfilling the requirements depends on each employee, as Semco does its best to adapt the working hours to each person's preferences.

Anwaruddin Khan (1672 ‚Äì 3 August 1749), also known as Muhammad Anwaruddin, was the 1st Nawab of Arcot of the second Dynasty. He was a major figure during the first two Carnatic Wars. He was also Subedar of Thatta from 1721-1733. Life Nawab Anwaruddin Khan was born at Gopamau, a place in the Hardoi District of Awadh, in 1672. He was the son of Haji Muhammad Anwar ud-din Khan. His official name at the height of his power was Amin us-Sultanat, Siraj ud-Daula, Nawab Haji Muhammad Jan-i-Jahan Anwar ud-din Khan Bahadur, Shahamat Jang, Subadar of the Carnatic. He went to Delhi and enlisted in the imperial army and soon rose to a high position. He was the Yameen-us-Sultanat (right-hand man) of Asaf Jah I (a.k.a. Nizam-ul-Mulk), the first Nizam of Hyderabad. He was also the ruler of Governor of Eloore and Rajamundry after 1725, Minister of Hyderabad, Faujdar of Korah and Jahanabad, He was granted the titles of Anwar ud-din Khan Bahadur by Emperor Aurangzeb 'Alamgir. to Shahamat Jang by Emperor Shah Alam I, and Siraj ud-Daula by Emperor Muhammad Shah. He was sometime Naib-wazir of the Empire, Faujdar of Srikakulam, Rajamahendravaram and Machlipatnam 1724, Nazim of Hyderabad 1725-1743. Muhammad Anwaruddin was appointed to Faujdar of Chicacole, Naib Subadar and regent of the Carnatic during the minority of Saadatullah Khan II on 28 March 1744. After the death of, Anwaruddin was appointed by the nizam as his representative and Nawab of the Carnatic in July 1744. Thus he became the founder of the Second Dynasty of the Nawab of the Carnatic. Anwaruddin maintaining a cordial relationship with the East India Company would come into conflict with the French after the death of Nizam-ul-Mulk in 1748. In 1746, the French and the English fought to achieve supremacy over each other in India in the First Carnatic War. The Carnatic region became the arena of their action. In 1746, the French captured the British post at Madras, and threatened but were unable to take that at Cuddalore. Muhammad Anwaruddin had warned both parties against attacking each other, but the French had disregarded his warning, and Joseph Fran√ßois Dupleix, the French governor- general, had placated him by offering him Madras. However, after its capture, Dupleix rescinded the offer, and Muhammad Anwarudding sought to capture it from them. He sent an army of 10,000 men under his son Mahfuz Khan. They fought against the 300-man French force in the Battle of Adyar on the banks of the Adyar River, and lost. The decisive French victory demonstrated the effectiveness of well-trained European forces in combating poorly trained Indian troops. Muhammad Anwaruddin received overtures for support from both from the English and the French, but supported the English. The French wanted to reduce the growing influence of the English in the Carnatic, so they supported Husayn Dost Khan, alias Chanda Sahib, as the rightful Nawab of the Carnatic against Muhammad Anwaruddin. While the British and the French supported their respective candidates for the Nawabship, they also took sides in the conflict over succession to the Nizam of Hyderabad. After the death of Nizam-ul-Mulk in 1748, there arose a rivalry between Nasir Jung, his second son, and Muzaffar Jang, his grandson. Muzaffar Jang came to the south with a strong force and allied himself with Chanda Sahib and the French. The aging Nawab Muhammad Anwaruddin, supported by the English, met the French army at Ambur on 3 August 1749 and was killed in the battle at the age of 77. He was mentioned as the oldest soldier to die on battlefield in \\"Ripley's believe it or not\\". Ripley stated that the Nawab died of gunshot wounds but that has not been independently verified.

They appear to have gill-like structures which resemble those of agarics, however the similarity is superficial only. The best-known member is the slimy spike-cap (Gomphidius glutinosus). The genus has a widespread distribution, especially in north temperate areas, and contains 10 species. Taxonomy Elias Magnus Fries initially described the genus as Agaricus subgenus Gomphus in 1821, before renaming it Gomphidius in 1825. The genus gives its name to the family Gomphidiaceae. Despite being agaricoid (bearing gills) the genus (and family) belong to the Boletales (suborder Suillineae). The related genus Chroogomphus (whose species were once classified in Gomphidius), is distinguished by the lack of a partial veil. The genus name is derived from the Greek 'Œ≥ŒøŒºœÜŒøœÇ' gomphos meaning 'plug' or 'large wedge-shaped nail'. Fries did not designate a type species, but G. glutinosus was later designated the lectotype as it was the first species listed. Miller subdivided the genus into three sections, section Microsporus, typified by small spores, with G. oregonensis as the type, section Roseogomphus, typified by large spores and pink cap, with G. subroseus as its type, and section Gomphidius. Miller published a molecular analysis of the Gomphidiaceae in 2003, though material was not available from all taxa. The results showed G. flavipes and G. pseudoflavipes were sister taxa and their lineage was sister to a Japan-provenance material of G. roseus. G. glutinosus and G. oregonensis were sister taxa with G. smithii, G. subroseus and G. nigricans as progressively earlier offshoots. G. maculatus diverged from the ancestor of these eight species, and Gomphidius borealis may be an early offshoot that is basal to the split between Chroogomphus and Gomphidius.

It is also called a bubble curtain. Air bubbling through a perforated pipe causes an upward water flow that slows the spread of oil. It can also be used to stop fish from entering polluted water. A further application of the pneumatic barrier is to decrease the salt-water exchange in navigation locks and prevent salt intrusion in rivers. . Pneumatic barriers are also known as air curtains. The pneumatic barrier is a (non-patented) invention of the Dutch engineer Johan van Veen from around 1940 . A pneumatic barrier is an active (as opposed to passive) method of waterway oil spill control. (An example of a passive method would be a containment boom.) Method of operation The pneumatic barrier consists of a perforated pipe and a compressed air source. Air escaping from the pipe provides a \\"hump\\" of rising water and air which contains the oil spill. Anchors to keep the pipe in a particular spot are helpful. In case of a density current due to salinity differences the barrier mixes the salt water, but also slows down the speed of the density current. Pneumatic barrier in navigation lock in the Netherlands Unique considerations At water-current speeds exceeding one foot per second, the pneumatic barrier no longer functions effectively, limiting deployable sites. Environmental issues The release of compressed air in the water adds oxygen to the local environment. This may be particularly useful in areas that have become a dead zone due to eutrophication. Air curtains may have another application. Dolphin and whale beaching has increased with the rise in ocean temperatures. On Thursday February 12th, 2017, a group of nearly 400 whales beached near Golden Bay on the tip of New Zealand‚Äôs South Island, following a similar incident earlier that week. The simplicity of an air curtain system, requiring only air compressors and perforated hoses, could allow for rapid deployment and create aerated zones of oxygenated seawater during a marine emergency. Air curtains are also used to control the release of smoke particles into the environment. After a natural disaster, or during brush clearing activities, debris is disposed of by incineration in either a ceramic or earth pit containment. Similar to an air curtain to separate indoor air from outdoor air, for instance in restaurants and walk-in refrigerators, a powerful air curtain can defeat the chimney effect of the incineration process to eliminate any smoke from a brush incinerator. The air curtain acts as a lid on the process, and forces the smoke back into the fuel bed for a cleaner burn. Disadvantages Like all active systems of any type, a mechanical failure can result in total failure of protection.

History The Colorado Volunteer Militia, predecessor of the Colorado Army National Guard, was originally formed in 1860. The Militia Act of 1903 organized the various state militias into the present National Guard system. The Colorado National Guard was involved in the suppression of multiple strikes, including the 1903‚Äì1904 Cripple Creek Strike while under the command of General John Chase. During the 1913‚Äì1914 United Mine Workers of America strike against the Rockefeller-owned Colorado Fuel and Iron company‚Äìan event known as the Colorado Coalfield War‚Äìthe Guard was deployed in October 1913, again under the command of Chase.McGovern, George; Guttridge, Leonard. The Great Coalfield War. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1972. 141 p. The Guard was involved in several violent encounters prior to the 20 April 1914 Ludlow Massacre, in which over a dozen women and children were killed when Guardsmen fired into a tent camp at Ludlow. Following the massacre, the Guard battled strikers throughout Southern Colorado during a 10-Day War.McGovern & Guttridge, 213. Originally Colorado was a part of the Southern Department. This was later redesignated, in 1920, as Eighth Corps Area, with headquarters at Fort Sam Houston Texas. In 1941 Colorado was transferred to the new Central Defense Command. Approximately 300 Colorado ARNG soldiers deployed to Iraq with the 36th Combat Aviation Brigade in September 2006.

Situated almost equidistant between the towns of Pontefract and Selby, the village dates back to at least the 11th century when it was listed in the Domesday Book (as Chelinctone).The National Archives  DocumentsOnline  Image Details The semi- rural community grew in size with the advent of local mining as housing was built to accommodate the workers of nearby Kellingley Colliery. Due to its location at the southernmost tip of North Yorkshire, the village is close to the borders of West, East and South Yorkshire. Its proximity to both the A19 and M62 major roads has resulted in a steady population growth, although to a lesser extent than its neighbour, Eggborough. The low-lying ground that separates the village from the River Aire has given rise to a history of flooding the surrounding farmland, most recently in 2000. Governance The Selby District Councillors for the village are local husband and wife team, John and Mary McCartney. John is also the North Yorkshire County Councillor for the division of Osgoldcross, which includes Kellington. Kellington Windmill, now converted into a house In 2008 the continuation of Kellington as a separate village was put at risk because of a proposal to turn it, along with neighbouring Beal and Eggborough, into a new town, under a scheme being promoted by the then Labour government of building so-called eco-towns around the country. This specific proposal was put in by a Leeds-based developer, GMI. Led by John and Mary McCartney all three villages rose up in anger. Using imaginative media stunts, innovative campaigning, sending thousands of emails and letters to decision makers and local and regional newspapers, lobbying those decision makers and attracting TV coverage the villagers were within a year successful.  Amenities  The Red Lion Sitting in the shadow of nearby Eggborough Power Station, Kellington has a variety of housing, with traditional country cottages, council housing and modern housing estates. The village is served by a pub, hotel and restaurant, Kellington Manor Hotel, which was previously known as Tree Tops and also as Squires, a small public house, The Red Lion. The small convenience store and the village Post Office have now both closed and the old Vicarage which was a guesthouse was demolished.

Villa Molin is a patrician residence in the neighborhood of Mandria, in Ponte della Cagna, south of Padua, in the Veneto region of northern Italy. It was designed for Nicol√≤ Molin, a Venetian noble,After the villa's completion Molin became the Venetian ambassador to James I of England. His official correspondence with the Serenissima, in the Calendar of state papers relating to English affairs in the archives of Venice, have long been mined by historians. by Vincenzo Scamozzi and completed in 1597. It faces Mandriola, on the opposite side of the Canale di Battaglia. The original agricultural setting of the villa, composed of pasture and orchards, has given way to a residential dormitory community of Padua. History The plot of land, comprising fifty-two fields lying between Mandria and Abano Terme, was in the possession of Donna Elena, widow of Vincenzo Molin, in 1582. When Nicol√≤ wished to erect there a villa for summer use that would be suited to the family's standing, it was natural to turn to Scamozzi, first among Venetian architects in the terraferma since the death of Palladio in 1580. The villa was rapidly completed but not long enjoyed by its patron, who died on 9 May 1608. Seven years later his brothers conveyed the villa to Pio Capodilista; it passed to his son Annibale, then to the heirs of Annibale's sister Sigismonda. Alienated from the Conti family in 1768‚Äì72, its return was the signal for a thorough-going restoration of its interiors in the hands of Antonio, which gave to the smaller rooms the Rococo stucco decorations of their vaulted ceilings. Passing through heiresses in the nineteenth century, the villa's lands were subdivided and it was eventually reduced to a farmhouse before being rehabilitated by a sympathetic new owner, Michele Dondi dall' Orologio. He provided the villa with its grand exterior staircase to the piano nobile and planted the surrounding parkland with specimen trees, now at full maturity. During World War I, the villa served as military command headquarters and was the site of preliminary negotiations that led to the signing of the Austrian-Italian Armistice of Villa Giusti on 11 March 1918. In 1955, Villa Molin was restored again by the industrialist Igino Kofler, who replanted the formal Italian walled gardens with boxwood-edged beds. Building The stucco-faced structure is built on a perfectly square plan, raised on a high rusticated service basement with an Ionic portico, lifted well above the public towpath and facing the Canal. This primary fa√ßade of the villa is reminiscent of Andrea Palladio's Villa RotondaScamozzi was responsible for the completion of the Villa after Palladio's death, and designed the low central dome modelled on that of the Pantheon with a central oculus or the Villa Foscari (called \\"La Malcontenta\\"). The solid sides of the portico are pierced by grand arch-headed openings to provide additional cross- draft in summer heat. The villa's other fa√ßades are simply treated and harmoniously symmetrical, with central Serlian windows, surmounted by the rectangular lanterna formed by the high cubical central sala that rises through the center of the roof, lit by tripartite lunette windows on each face. The grand central room thus enclosed is frescoed with trompe-l'oeil niches, columns, balustrades, and flanked by symmetrically arranged smaller and lower barrel-vaulted rooms that are linked by generous arched openings. Thus, there is an articulated central reception space in the form of a Greek cross. The vestibules give onto more intimate spaces, in a series of cubes, double cubes and \\"golden mean\\" rectangles characteristic of cinquecento villa floor plans.See Rudolf Wittkower, Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism, The Warburg Institute, London, 1949.

Kerker then moved to New York City, where he was engaged as the principal conductor at the Casino Theatre. There, he began to add his own songs into the scores of foreign operettas, notably Charles Lecocq's The Pearl of Pekin, since these works had no effective copyright in the U.S. Vocal score Kerker's first complete operetta in New York was Castles in the Air in 1890.

The network of hyphae is referred to as a mycelium, which is fundamental to fungal nutrition. Saprotrophic nutrition or lysotrophic nutrition is a process of chemoheterotrophic extracellular digestion involved in the processing of decayed (dead or waste) organic matter. It occurs in saprotrophs, and is most often associated with fungi (for example Mucor) and soil bacteria. Saprotrophic microscopic fungi are sometimes called saprobes; saprotrophic plants or bacterial flora are called saprophytes (sapro- + -phyte, \\"rotten material\\" + \\"plant\\"), though it is now believed that all plants previously thought to be saprotrophic are in fact parasites of microscopic fungi or other plants. The process is most often facilitated through the active transport of such materials through endocytosis within the internal mycelium and its constituent hyphae. states the purpose of saprotrophs and their internal nutrition, as well as the main two types of fungi that are most often referred to, as well as describes, visually, the process of saprotrophic nutrition through a diagram of hyphae, referring to the Rhizobium on damp, stale whole-meal bread or rotting fruit. Various word roots relating to decayed matter (detritus, sapro-), eating and nutrition (-vore, -phage), and plants or life forms (-phyte, -obe) produce various terms, such as detritivore, detritophage, saprotroph, saprophyte, saprophage, and saprobe; their meanings overlap, although technical distinctions (based on physiologic mechanisms) narrow the senses. For example, usage distinctions can be made based on macroscopic swallowing of detritus (as an earthworm does) versus microscopic lysis of detritus (as a mushroom does). A facultative saprophyte appears on stressed or dying plants and may combine with the live pathogens.  Process  As matter decomposes within a medium in which a saprotroph is residing, the saprotroph breaks such matter down into its composites. * Proteins are broken down into their amino acid composites through the breaking of peptide bonds by proteases., fig 14.16‚ÄîDiagram detailing the re-absorption of substrates within the hypha. * Lipids are broken down into fatty acids and glycerol by lipases. * Starch is broken down into pieces of simple disaccharides by amylases. * Cellulose, a major portion of plant cells, and therefore a major constituent of decaying matter is broken down into glucose These products are re-absorbed into the hypha through the cell wall by endocytosis and passed on throughout the mycelium complex. This facilitates the passage of such materials throughout the organism and allows for growth and, if necessary, repair. = Conditions = In order for a saprotrophic organism to facilitate optimal growth and repair, favourable conditions and nutrients must be present., fig 14.17‚ÄîA diagram explaining the optimal conditions needed for successful growth and repair. Optimal conditions refers to several conditions which optimise the growth of saprotrophic organisms, such as; # Presence of water: 80‚Äì90% of the mass of the fungi is composed of water, and the fungi require excess water for absorption due to the evaporation of internally retained water. # Presence of oxygen: Very few saprotrophic organisms can endure anaerobic conditions as evidenced by their growth above media such as water or soil. # Neutral-acidic pH: The condition of neutral or mildly acidic conditions under pH 7 are required. # Low-medium temperature: The majority of saprotrophic organisms require temperatures between 1 ¬∞C and 35 ¬∞C, with optimum growth occurring at 25 ¬∞C. The majority of nutrients taken in by such organisms must be able to provide carbon, proteins, vitamins and in some cases, ions. Due to the carbon composition of the majority of organisms, dead and organic matter provide rich sources of disaccharides and polysaccharides such as maltose and starch, and of the monosaccharide glucose. In terms of nitrogen-rich sources, saprotrophs require combined protein for the creation of proteins, which is facilitated by the absorption of amino acids, and usually taken from rich soil. Although both ions and vitamins are rare, thiamine or ions such as potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium aid the growth of the mycelium.

The family takes its name from its largest genus, the varied species of the genus Cortinarius. Many genera formerly in the Corinariaceae have been placed in various other families, including Hymenogastraceae, Inocybaceae and Bolbitiaceae. The deadly toxin orellanine has been found in at least 34 Cortinariaceae. Taxonomic details Cortinariaceae is a family of mushrooms within the Order Agaricales. The spore producing hymenium is located on the gills. The pileipellis is a cutis. The spores are brown in deposit and, in most genera in this family, the spores are ornamented. Differences in genera Cortinarius are mushrooms with warted spores, which are rusty-brown in deposit. Mushrooms in this genus have a partial veil which is a cortina. These mushrooms are terrestrial and mycorrhizal, and can range from small to large and fleshy. Edibility Despite the vast number of species in Cortinariaceae, this group is not widely eaten, and is generally avoided. There are many toxic species in this group and few are highly prized. Cortinarius is one of the largest mushroom families, but due to the large amount of inedible and toxic species, most authors recommend not eating any Cortinarius. At one point, the Polish ate the fool's webcap, Cortinarius orellanus, until people began to get poisoned from eating the mushroom. It is now known that several Cortinarius species contain a deadly toxin, orellanine, which causes kidney failure. Most Cortinarius are either too small or unpleasant-tasting to eat, but some, such as the gypsy mushroom (Cortinarius caperatus) and the large and tasty Cortinarius praestans, are highly esteemed. However, some mycologists believe that no Cortinarius should be eaten.

Early life McKinstry was born in Connecticut, United States. Education She holds an MBA (Finance & Marketing) from Columbia Business School, a bachelor's degree in economics from University of Rhode Island (Phi Beta Kappa), and received an honorary doctorate from University of Rhode Island. Early career Early in her career, McKinstry held management positions with Booz & Company (formerly Booz Allen Hamilton, currently known as Strategy&), an international management consulting firm, where she focused on assignments in the media and technology industries. In 1999, McKinstry worked as CEO of SCP Communications, a medical information company, before rejoining Wolters Kluwer to head its North American operations. Wolters Kluwer Before becoming a CEO of Wolters Kluwer in 2003, McKinstry was chief executive of the company‚Äôs North American operations and had held a range of senior positions at subsidiaries, including chief executive of CCH Legal Information Services, now a part of Wolters Kluwer‚Äôs Legal & Regulatory division. Earlier, McKinstry held product management positions with CCH INCORPORATED, now part of Wolters Kluwer‚ÄôsTax & Accounting division. She is both the Dutch company‚Äôs first American and first female chief executive. She has praised her board‚Äôs ‚Äúcourage‚Äù in making the appointment and credits her deep group experience in helping with ‚Äúthe transformation from print to digital ‚Ä¶ as quickly as possible‚Äù. Today three-quarters of Wolters Kluwer's revenue comes from online or electronic products, up from 71 percent in 2011, and 49 percent when the transition from print was launched at the end of 2008. McKinstry is not a fan of quotas, but considers diversity a priority for the company. Currently Wolters Kluwer has 28% female executives (in 2003, only 20% had top leadership posts), 43% female managers, and 54% female employees. \\"In my experience it's key to have strong diversity at the middle management level because that is really what you draw on as you look to fill executive positions. If you don't have enough diversity at that level it's very difficult to be able to really get diversity at the most senior levels.\\" She takes a hands on approach to making sure women are rising to the top, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been able to attract female talent because they see women leading different parts of the company. Diversity helps, it is a self-fulfilling prophecy.‚Äù Wolters Kluwer has a talent management program which identifies high potential executives, \\"We specifically work on programs to provide them with the right experience to ensure they're developing the kind of leadership skills that they would need to get to the top of the organization.\\" Today many of the company's key businesses are run by women. Two of the largest divisions have female CEO's - Karen Abramson, CEO for Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting and Stacey Caywood, CEO of Wolters Kluwer Legal & Regulatory Shasha Chang is the Chief Executive Officer of Wolters Kluwer China since June 2009, overseeing all Wolters Kluwer activities in greater China, one of the key growth markets for the company. \\"In some companies, women tend to take on functional roles but at Wolters Kluwer, women have responsibility for a P&L.; You have to have that kind of experience and track record if you eventually want to aspire to be a CEO of a company or to sit as a non-executive director of a multi- national,\\" McKinstry says. Innovation is the key to Wolters Kluwer's success. That‚Äôs why the company invests 8-10% of its annual revenues in new product developments and encourages employees to bring forward innovative ideas. In 2012 McKinstry instituted a company-wide innovation contest to spur thought leadership, which also allows her to review the pool of talent, including women.

She is a member of the Advisory Council of the Amsterdam Institute of Finance, the Advisory Board for the University of Rhode Island, the Advisory Board of the Harrington School of Communication and Media, and the Board of Overseers of Columbia Business School. In August 2011, she was appointed by the Chinese State Council Information Office as a member of the Foreign Consultant Committee, given her astute business leadership and long-standing expertise in the information and publishing industry. In 2012 McKinstry was ranked number 15 on Fortune‚Äôs Global 50 Most Powerful Women in Business (and 13 in 2011.) She has been in the top 10 on this list in 2004, 2005, and 2006.

National coordination of various state National Guard units are maintained through the National Guard Bureau. The Delaware Army National Guard maintains 15 armories in 12 communities. Delaware Army National Guard units are trained and equipped as part of the United States Army. The same ranks and insignia are used and National Guardsmen are eligible to receive all United States military awards. The Delaware Guard also bestows a number of state awards for local services rendered in or to the state of Delaware. History The Delaware Army National Guard traces its origins back to August 31, 1655, when Swedish settlers were asked to take up arms to defend the colony against a Dutch attack on Fort Christina. During the American Revolution, Delaware's First Regiment fought with General George Washington at the Battle of Long Island. In the War of 1812 all Delaware volunteer units saw service at Lewes, where they comprised the bulk of force that drove off a British naval squadron seeking control of the Delaware River. The 198th Signal Battalion (ARNG DE), which traces its lineage to three militia units that were federalized during the War of 1812, is one of only nineteen Army National Guard units with campaign credit for the War of 1812. In the Mexican War (1846‚Äì1847), the Federal Government would not accept volunteer companies but the Delaware volunteers were not content to stay home. After much red tape, a statewide composite unit was formed. They fought with distinction in the battles of Contreras, Cherubusco, Molino del Ray and Chapultepec where there were almost twice as many Delaware volunteers present as marines. The unit lost so many men in these actions it became known as \\"The Bloody 11th.\\" http://delawarenationalguard.com/aboutus/history/ Delaware Army National Guardsmen planning their strategy during a marksmanship exercise The Militia Act of 1903 organized the various state militias into the present National Guard system. One of the units formed since was the 198th Coast Artillery (AA), which traces its history to the three militia units referred to above. Governor Charles L. Terry, Jr. deployed the National Guard to the city of Wilmington following the assassination of The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on April 9, 1968, at the request of Mayor John Babiarz. One week later, Mayor Babiarz requested the National Guard troops be withdrawn, but Governor Terry refused, and kept them in the city until his term ended in January, 1969. This is reportedly the longest occupation of an American city by state forces in the nation's history. In the aftermath of the occupation, recruiting offices of all military branches were removed from locations within the city limits until the early 2000s. In the 1980s, aviation regiments began forming in both the regular Army and the National Guard. The 150th Aviation Regiment was created in Delaware from the 150th Aviation Battalion of the 50th Armored Division. Following the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, numerous units of the Delaware Army National Guard have deployed to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. Troops from both the Delaware Army and Air National Guard volunteered to support disaster relief operations in Louisiana and Mississippi in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. \\"Operation Arctic Vengeance I and II\\" saw over 300 DEARNG Soldiers volunteer to support the State of Emergency declared by Gov. Jack Markell following a pair of debilitating snowstorms from Feb. 7 through Feb. 12, 2010.

The series details the rise of an ordinary man named Arness, bestowed with godlike powers in his search for revenge against the tyrannical Lord Vulmax, whose minions destroyed his village and slew his wife.  Synopsis  The story begins in the village of Kenopia, home to the butcher Arness, a humble man whose primary interest is wedding his love, Dalia. In order to pay for her ring, however, he works with an older man of the village, Rothian, collecting wood. Yet this most recent night is different: Rothian has summoned Arness to help him slay a Grizzlok, a gigantic, fearsome beast never known to roam so far in the north. After a bloody conflict with the beast, Arness manages to slay it, and is paid by Rothian with both a bag of emeralds and a warning: that he should flee, for the evil hordes of Lord Vulmax are growing in strength. After their wedding, the couple decide to heed Rothian's words and flee, so Arness ventures into the woods to forage. However, while he is gone, their home is attacked and destroyed, and when Arness returns, he finds death and destruction and his beloved wife gone. As he grieves over the devastation and his loss, he is struck down by an armored assailant and knocked unconscious. When he wakes, he finds himself a slave to the cruel inhabitants of a foreign fortress, worked mercilessly to build its defenses against the oncoming hordes. It is this fortress that serves as the platform for Arness' adventure, propelling him into a vast world full of creatures both friendly and hostile, friends and foes, and magical relics of awesome power. But will these treasures be enough to hold back the wrath of Lord Vulmax?

She is currently the Scott and Donya Bommer Professor in Economics at Stanford University and program director of the Economics of Education Program for the National Bureau of Economic Research. Hoxby is a John and Lydia Pearce Mitchell University Fellow in Undergraduate Education. She is also a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. Biography Hoxby is a native of Shaker Heights, Ohio, where she attended Shaker Heights High School. Her father, Steven Minter, worked in the U.S. Department of Education during the presidency of Jimmy Carter. Hoxby graduated with summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard University in 1988, where she won a Hoopes Prize. She then attended Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship. In 1994, she received her doctorate in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. From 1994 to 2007, she was a faculty member of Harvard University, first as an assistant professor, then as Morris Kahn Associate Professor of Economics, and starting in 2001 as the Allie S. Freed Professor of Economics. She was the university's only African-American economics professor with tenure. In 2005, she was appointed to be one of the 24 Harvard College Professors.Harvard Gazette: Six honored as Harvard College Professors In 2006, she won the Phi Beta Kappa Teaching Prize.Harvard College Phi Beta Kappa Teaching Prize She moved to Stanford University in 2007, where she is the Scott and Donya Bommer Professor of Economics. She was named the John and Lydia Pearce Mitchell University Fellow in Undergraduate Education in 2014. She has been married to Blair Hoxby, also a Harvard graduate and a Rhodes Scholar, since 1993. He is currently a faculty member in the English department at Stanford University and does scholarly work on John Milton and Renaissance theater. Research Hoxby's research focuses on higher education policy, with an emphasis on elite colleges and universities. Hoxby is a Principal Investigator of the Expanding College Opportunities project, a randomized controlled trial that had dramatic effects on low-income, high achievers' college-going. For work related to this project, she recently received The Smithsonian Institution's Ingenuity Award. Her research in this area began with a demonstration that low-income high achievers usually fail to apply to any selective college. This is despite the fact that they are extremely likely to be admitted and receive such generous financial aid that they usually pay much less to attend selective colleges than they do to attend non-selective schools. This issue is now being addressed systematically owing to the project's evidence that individualized but inexpensive informational interventions cause students to take fuller advantage of their opportunities. One of Hoxby's most-cited papers, \\"Does Competition among Public Schools Benefit Students and Taxpayers?\\" (American Economic Review, 2000), argues that increased school choice improves educational outcomes for all students by improving school quality. Jesse Rothstein published a paper in which he stated that Hoxby's result depended on her hand-count of the main instrumental variable, and that he was unable to replicate her results with any of several alternative measures.Jesse Rothstein, Does Competition Among Public Schools Benefit Students and Taxpayers? A Comment on Hoxby (2000) Hoxby later published a response in defense of her original work. The debate received coverage in the mainstream press. Selected publications =Edited books= * Caroline M.

He is the Deputy Chief of the party's Kangar division. Hashim made headlines in Malaysia in 2006 when he made a number of controversial remarks at the UMNO General Assembly that some labelled as seditious. Controversy In 2005, Education Minister and UMNO Youth Chief Hishammuddin Hussein brandished a kris (Malay dagger) at the UMNO General Assembly. The kris, named Panca Warisan, made another appearance at the 2006 General Assembly. On both occasions, it had been used in the context of defending certain special privileges accorded to the Malays under the Constitution of Malaysia. These privileges, sometimes referred to as the Malay Agenda, formed half of the Malaysian social contract, which granted citizenship to non-Malay Malaysians in return for special rights for the Malays. (Such special rights feature heavily in the ideal of ketuanan Melayu or Malay supremacy, which is a feature of UMNO's ideology.) It was after the second instance of Hishammuddin's actions that Hashim made headlines, when Hashim, speaking as a UMNO delegate from the state of Perlis, asked: \\"Datuk Hisham has unsheathed his keris, waved his keris, kissed his keris. We want to ask Datuk Hisham when is he going to use it?\\" He continued that \\"force must be used against those who refused to abide by the social contract\\", insisting that Hishammuddin be tougher in dealing with the Chinese national-type schools, which though publicly funded, are generally independent of the public national school system. Hashim's remark provoked a response from the opposition Democratic Action Party, which accused him of creating \\"concern and disquiet among non-Malays in the country. The statements amount to sedition as they have a seditious tendency\\".'Hisham and his keris' remark shocks Karpal. (18 November 2006). Malaysiakini.

History  Until the early 20th century, much of West Grimstead was owned by landed gentry and was part of larger estates. There are early references to the De Grimstede family, the village passing from them through the male line first to the Perots, then to the Berkeleys; next through the female line to the Breretons; again by the male line to Sir William Compton of Compton Wynyates. West Grimstead was then sold by Richard Compton to Sir Stephen Fox, later Earl of Ilchester. West Grimstead remained part of the Ilchester estate through the 18th century until it was sold to the 2nd Earl of Radnor in 1801 at the time of the parish's Inclosure Act. In 1916 the whole village was sold by the Longford Estate, mainly to sitting tenants. The Salisbury and Southampton Canal was built close to the north of the village. In 1803 the section eastward from West Grimstead was opened, linking to the Andover Canal near Kimbridge; the canal was never completed as far as Salisbury and closed in 1806. In 1847 the London and South Western Railway opened its line between Bishopstoke in Hampshire and Milford station at Salisbury, following the route of the canal but in a straighter line. The railway remains open as part of the Wessex Main Line from Salisbury to Southampton.  Religious sites  Parts of the Church of England parish church of Saint John date from about 1300, but the brick tower is from the early 18th century. A stained glass window by Heaton, Butler and Bayne was installed in 1900 and in 1960 the church was designated as Grade II* listed. A Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built in the village in 1825 and gained more worshippers than the church. A larger chapel was built on the same site in 1869 and a schoolroom was added in 1885. The chapel closed in 2009 and was converted for residential use.  Local government  Since 1934 the village has elected Grimstead parish council, together with East Grimstead. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which performs all significant local government functions.  Amenities  There is a village hall, built in 1913. The village shop and public house closed some years ago. The village school closed in 1993, replaced by a new school built in Alderbury for the children of both Alderbury and West Grimstead.

Dendrologie; B√§ume, Str√§ucher und Halbstr√§ucher, welche in Mittel- und Nord- Europa im Freien kultivirt werden 2 (1), 416 (1872) the various descriptions appearing to tally. Henry (1913) noted that the Ulmus campestris var. purpurea Petz. & Kirchn. grown at Kew as U. montana var. purpurea was \\"probably of hybrid origin\\", Ulmus montana being used at the time both for wych elm cultivars and for some of the U. √ó hollandica group. His description of Kew's U. montana var. purpurea matches that of the commonly- planted 'Purpurea' of the 20th century. His discussion of it (1913) under U. campestris, however, his name for English Elm, may be the reason why 'Purpurea' is sometimes erroneously called U. procera 'Purpurea' (as in USA and Sweden ('Cultivation' and 'Accessions'). The fact that 'Purpurea' occasionally produces root-suckers confirms a hybrid origin with some U. minor component. F. J. Fontaine (1968) conjectured U. glabra √ó U. minor 'Stricta' and placed the tree in the U. √ó hollandica group under the name U. √ó hollandica 'Purpurascens',Bean, W. J. (1988) Trees and shrubs hardy in Great Britain, 8th edition, Murray, London, p. 640 (under U. angustifolia a name accepted by Royal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh and in Australian publications.Spencer, Roger, ed., Horticultural Flora of South-Eastern Australia, Vol. 2 (Sydney, 1995), Ulmus, p.111Spencer, R., Hawker, J. and Lumley, P. (1991). Elms in Australia. Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne. . The samarae, leaves and the habit of 'Purpurea' appear to support this conjecture. See also 'Atropurpurea', possibly synonymous, raised by the Sp√§th nursery in Berlin c.1881 and sometimes classed as a wych cultivar. Wych elm itself occasionally produces red- or purple-flushed new leaves, the 19th century variety 'Corylifolia Purpurea' perhaps being an example. There is also a small-leaved elm U. minor 'Purpurascens' ( = Ulmus 'Myrtifolia Purpurea'), which nurseries listed and distributed separately from U. campestris purpurea Hort.. In North America, purple-leaved elms encountered in the fall are likely to be the new hybrid Ulmus 'Frontier'. Description Of Ulmus Stricta Purpurea Wood wrote (1851): \\"When young, the foliage is dark purple, in the way of the Purple Beech. As the season advances, it becomes somewhat greener, but always retains a distinct and peculiar character.\\" The leaves of Wesmael's (1863) Ulmus purpurea Hort. were a \\"characteristic bronzy green\\" (canopy new leaves). Those of Petzold and Kirchner's (1864) Ulmus campestris var. purpurea, syn. Ulmus purpurea Hort., \\"emerged dark purple, later becoming more green, but always of a very dark, reddish-green which is peculiar\\". Koch's U. purpurea (1872) had \\"leaves purple when young, changing to dark green\\". 'Purpurea' grows to > 25 m in height, and is short-trunked with open, straggling, ascending branches. The leaf-buds are long, sharply pointed and dark purple, on shoots of the same colour. The flowers, too, emerge a uniform dark purple. The fruit, tinged purple over the seed, is intermediate between U. glabra and U. minor. The leaves, which are slightly folded, have a brief purplish-green flush in spring. The new leaves of lower bole-shoots and of suckers are pure dark purple, without any green.Photograph of newly emerged leaves of 'Purpurea' in Denmark, www.loenbaek.dk Emerging 'Purpurea' leaves photographed against sunlight, www.kuningas.ee Photograph of 'Purpurea' cuttings, www.kuningas.ee After the spring flush, the leaves become olive green then darken in the summer. Their underside is paler, so that, with their increasing fold as the year progresses, the late-summer foliage has a greyish look. The bark of younger trees has a reddish-brown hue.Spencer, Roger, ed., Horticultural Flora of South-Eastern Australia, Vol. 2 (Sydney, 1995), Ulmus, p.112 File:AZ0016. Ulmus Purpurea samarae.

Unlike Army Reserve members, National Guard members cannot be mobilized individually (except through voluntary transfers and Temporary Duty Assignments TDY), but only as part of their respective units. However, there has been a significant number of individual activations to support military operations. =Active duty call- ups= For much of the final decades of the twentieth century, National Guard personnel typically served \\"one weekend a month, two weeks a year\\", with a portion working for the Guard in a full-time capacity. The current forces formation plans of the US Army call for the typical National Guard unit (or national guardsman) to serve one year of active duty for every three years of service. More specifically, current Department of Defense policy is that no guardsman will be involuntarily activated for a total of more than 24 months (cumulative) in one six-year enlistment period (this policy is due to change 1 August 2007, the new policy states that soldiers will be given 24 months between deployments of no more than 24 months, individual states have differing policies). History The Georgia Army National Guard was originally formed in 1751. The 118th Field Artillery (GA ARNG), which traces its lineage to militia units from Savannah and surrounding Chatham County that served in the War of 1812, is one of only nineteen Army National Guard units with campaign credit for the War of 1812. The Militia Act of 1903 organized the various U.S. state militias into the present National Guard system. The 121st and 122nd Infantry Regiments, formed from existing Georgia state regiments, formed the 61st Infantry Brigade of the 31st Dixie Division mobilized for World War I.McGrath, The Brigade, 169. The two regiments served with that brigade from August 1917 to November 1918. After World War II, the 48th Infantry Division was organized in the state, but on 1 November 1955, was reorganized as the 48th Armored Division. The division was commanded before and immediately after its change of name by Maj. Gen. Joseph B. Fraser of Hinesville. The new armored division‚Äôs authorized strength was 7,727, a drop of more than 2,000 from the Infantry Division; however a non-divisional group of more than 2,000 was also formed during the 1955 reorganization and re- designation of Georgia‚Äôs Army Guard units.http://www.dod.state.ga.us/firstfridayonline/nov06/index.html, accessed September 2009 The 48th Armored Division was disbanded on 1 January 1968. Insignia of the 171st Aviation Regiment The 118th Field Artillery was broken up on 1 January 1968 and its elements reorganized and were redesignated, with Headquarters, Headquarters and Service Battery, 1st Battalion, consolidated with Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 48th Armored Division Artillery, and the consolidated unit reorganized and was redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 118th Artillery Group. It was redesignated on 9 May 1978 as Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 118th Field Artillery Brigade. In 1984-85, the 118th Field Artillery Brigade was headquartered at Savannah and comprised the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 214th Field Artillery, both using 155-mm towed artillery pieces.Isby and Kamps, 1985, 385. In the late 1980s the 171st Aviation Regiment was formed in the state.

Subspecies Four subspecies of Otolemur garnettii are recognized: * Otolemur garnettii garnettii * Otolemur garnettii lasiotis * Otolemur garnettii kikuyuensis * Otolemur garnettii panganiensis Physical characteristics This species has a large body size relative to other galagos. The ears are small relative to the round head with short, wide snout. The eyes are large and binocular. The dentition formula is 2:1:3:3. The coloration depends upon subspecies: O. g. garnetti exhibits green-tinged reddish brown dorsal pelage. The ventral side is yellow and the terminal half of the tail is black. O. g. lasiotis has lighter and more gray toned fur than O. g. garnetti. The ventral side is white and the tail's terminal end of the tail is only slightly darker than the rest with a white tip. O. g. kikuyuensis exhibits iron gray fur tinged with green on its back, flanks and limbs. The ventral side is yellow-white. The tail is usually light brown with the terminal quarter being black. O. g. panganiensis is reddish brown to gray lacking the greenish hints in other species, while the ventral surface varies from white to yellow. The terminal quarter of the tail is dark brown or black. The northern greater galago has a head-and-body length of 23‚Äì34 cm (26 cm average), a tail length of 31‚Äì44 cm (average 36 cm) and body weight of 0.5‚Äì1 kg (mean 0.75 kg). This species exhibits significant degree of sexual size dimorphism with males larger than the females. This is due to bimaturism, where males have a longer period of growth and have an average 19% greater body mass than females. The average male is 794 g and the average adult female is 734 g. Distribution and habitat The species is found in coastal regions of East Africa ranging from the Juba River in Somalia to the Ruvuma River in Tanzania. It also can be found inland throughout the Kenyan highlands and on the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba. The species is restricted to coastal and riverine forests or Kenyan highland forest. It does not inhabit woodland savannah. The actual geographic range of each subspecies is as follows: O. g. garnetti is restricted to Zanzibar and the Pemba Islands. O. g. lasiotis is found along the Kenyan coast as far north as the Juba River and south to Tanga and Tanzania. Its range extends inland to the Taita Hills and Kibwezi. O. g. kikuyuensis is found in the Kenyan Highlands. O. g. panganiensis is found throughout Tanzania from the border of Mozambique north to Tanga. Behavior and diet The northern greater galago is a nocturnal predominantly arboreal primate. During the day, they sleep alone in trees and emerge at night. They tend to focus on a particularly portion of their home range for several nights while foraging, then move on to concentrate on a new section after a short time. They are quadrupedal and are capable of hopping short distances from tree to tree. Unlike their larger relatives the brown greater galagos, northern greater galagos can land hind feet first when leaping. Their diet consists primarily of fruit and insects, approximately a 50/50 mix. They are capable of learned behaviors to fish and consume mollusks when available. Territory and social behavior Greater northern galagos are solitary and live and forage in their home range marked by urine and scent gland on chest. Males and females disperse from their birth territory, with males doing so earlier and moving farther away. Males and females do not have ranges that overlap with same sex and same-aged individuals. Males have territories that overlap with several females. However, females tend to be dominant over males. Males tend to follow females around and females show more aggression to transient individuals passing through their home territory than do males. These species are less social compared to Otolemur crassicaudatus likely due to the fact they are frugivorous. It is more profitable to exclude non related individuals from areas where fruit is available. They still exhibit some social play. Social grooming is not present instead reciprocal licking performs function of grooming while minimizing social interaction. Reproduction morphology and behavior Male galago species possess very distinctive penile morphology that can be used to classify species.Perkin, Andrew. \\"Comparative penile morphology of East African galagos of the genus Galagoides (family Galagidae): implications for taxonomy.\\" American journal of primatology 69.1 (2007): 16-26. The northern greater galago penis is on average 18 mm in length and width of shaft is even from body to bottom of tip. The baculum is clearly visible at the tip. The glans terminates with a characteristic set of curves which does not occur in any other species. The surface is spined with doubled headed or even tridentate penile spines pointing towards the body. They are less densely packed than in Otolemur crassicaudatus. Northern greater galagos are promiscuous in their sexual behavior. The female comes into estrus once a year in the spring. The male is drawn to a female in heat and emits a sex call. If the female is receptive, she will allow copulation with the male licking her head following intercourse. This process may be repeated. The gestation period for this species is 130 days with females usually only having one offspring at any time. Twins are rare. Mothers carry their infants with their mouths to nests and leave them while they forage, returning to nurse their young. Infants are weaned by the 5th week and reach sexual maturity by 20 months of age. Miscellaneous A low-coverage genomic sequence of the northern greater galago, was completed in 2006. As a 'primitive' primate, the sequence is particularly useful in bridging the sequences of higher primates (macaque, chimp, human) to close non-primates such as rodents. The current 2x coverage is not sufficient to create a full genome assembly, but will provide comparative data across most of the human assembly.

History The Fighters' List grew out of Lehi, a militant Revisionist paramilitary organisation that operated in Palestine during the Mandate era, and in Israel until shortly after independence. Lehi was a controversial group, described by the British, the majority of the Yishuv, and the UN as a terrorist organisation. It had been involved in a series of notorious actions, including the assassination of Lord Moyne and the Deir Yassin massacre. The group was disbanded and integrated into the IDF in May 1948. However, they continued to act in Jerusalem until being forcefully broken up after the assassination of Count Folke Bernadotte, a UN mediator, on 17 September 1948. After the final dissolution of Lehi, left-wing former members founded the Fighters' List to represent their cause in the 1949 elections. The list was headed by Natan Yellin-Mor, the former leader of Lehi, who at the time was in jail serving an eight-year sentence for leadership of Lehi, which had been outlawed and declared a terrorist organization. The party's election platform demanded the continuation of the war against Transjordan and Iraq to establish Jewish sovereignty on both sides of the Jordan River. The party won only 5,363 votes (1.22% of the total) and one seat in the first Knesset, and Yellin-Mor was released from prison as part of a general amnesty to take up his seat. During the period of Yellin-Mor's term in the Knesset, the Fighters' List suffered severe internal divisions. Yellin-Mor pressed strongly for a pro- Soviet orientation and called for the establishment of a socialist regime and classless society. The vehement opposition of the former Lehi leader Yisrael Eldad, who accused Yellin-Mor of betraying the memory of Lehi's founder Yair Stern, led to his expulsion from the party.Heller (1995), pp. 268‚Äì283. Only the Fighters' List supported Herut's motion of no confidence concerning the armistice agreements, and it was soundly defeated. The party did not compete in the 1951 elections.

It was distributed by the Sp√§th nursery, Berlin, in the late 1890s and early 1900s as U. montana triserrata Kirch.. Description 'Cornuta' is distinguished only by the one or two cusp-like lobes either side of the apex of the leaf on strong-growing shoots, similar to Ulmus laciniata. Short-shoot leaves lack the cusps.Bean, W. J. (1981). Trees and shrubs hardy in Great Britain, 7th edition. Murray, London. Fontaine (1968) reported that 'Cornuta' had a more reddish-brown autumn colouring than other elms. U. triserrata Hort. (syn. U. intermedia Hort.) was described in Petzold and Kirchner as \\"very similar to U. montana, but the leaves appear to be firmer, a little shorter, and widened towards the tip. The tip is very sharp-pointed, likewise the two large teeth, one on each side, in consequence of which the leaf appears tricuspidate. A form similar in appearance but less pronounced occurs in U. montana.\\" Sp√§th catalogues describe the leaf of U. montana triserrata as \\"usually three-pointed\\", but herbarium leaf-specimens in the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh from Sp√§th's specimens show a non-cuspidate leaf with a triserrate (triple-toothed) margin (see External links below). Pests and diseases A cultivar of the Wych Elm, 'Cornuta' is susceptible to Dutch Elm disease. Cultivation Fontaine (1968) reported that a form of 'Cornuta' was cultivated along the Reguliersgracht, Amsterdam, \\"with reasonable success as a street tree\\". 'Cornuta' is now very rare in cultivation. Although introduced to North America, there is no record of its introduction to Australasia. One tree, possibly 'Cornuta', was planted in 1897 as U. montana laciniata syn. U. montana triserrata at the Dominion Arboretum, Ottawa, Canada. Three specimens supplied by Sp√§th to the RBGE in 1902 as U. montana triserrata may survive in Edinburgh, as it was the practice of the Garden to distribute trees about the city (viz. the Wentworth Elm); the current list of Living Accessions held in the Garden per se does not list the plant. A specimen obtained from Sp√§th as Ulmus triserrata and planted in 1916 stood in the Ryston Hall arboretum, Norfolk,rystonhall.co.uk/ in the early 20th century.

Basing the plot partially on a story told to her by a stranger, Kim began an early version of 12 Days as a sophomore in college to help herself cope with the end of a relationship. After moving on emotionally with her break-up, she stopped developing the comic and later left South Korea to attend the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan, New York, United States, from which she graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in cartooning. Following her successful pitch of 12 Days to manga publisher Tokyopop, she resumed work on it in early 2005 and finished in the middle of August 2006. 12 Days focuses on Jackie Yuen, who decides to drink the ashes of her former lover for twelve days in beverages as a way to cope with her grief over her death. Tokyopop published 12 Days in North America on 7 November 2006, to generally positive reviews. Critics praised the manga for its mature portrayal of grief and relationships, and its realistic artwork, although the choice of print for the dialogue was considered distracting. Reviewers also discussed the comic's treatment of the issues of love, loss, and lesbian elements. In May 2011, Tokyopop shut down its North American publishing branch, with the status of its original, global manga titles left unclear. Plot For the first eight chapters, 12 Days centers on Jackie Yuen, a 29-year-old part Cantonese and part Korean editor. After the death of her former lover, the Korean American school nurse Noah Yoon, she decides to drink her ashes over twelve days in beverages as a way of coping with her grief. Nicholas \\"Nick\\" Yoon, Noah's younger half brother, steals some of Noah's ashes for her to use, and soon joins her in mourning. She reminisces on how she met her and became involved in a lesbian relationship; however, Noah ended their relationship to marry a man to appease her father, and died returning from her honeymoon in a car accident a month ago. As Jackie continues her ritual, she begins to feel ill and eventually faints. Nick takes her to the hospital, where she recovers. On New Year's Day, she parts from Nick and returns to her apartment to find that he has taken the engagement ring she had wanted to give Noah, and unknown to her, he mixes it in with the remaining ashes. 12 Days concludes with \\"Chapter 0\\", set before the events in the rest of the comic: Noah finds Nick studying for exams, and they briefly discuss Artemisia II of Caria, an ancient Greek queen who drank the ashes of her husband. Noah then hints that she has found someone whose ashes she would drink. Style and issues June Kim, the author and illustrator for 12 Days, primarily drew the artwork in the realism style, although she occasionally rendered characters as super-deformed versions of themselves. While the cover art incorporates red and silver coloring, the artwork primarily appears in black and white, with occasional gray shading. Kim used pen and ink as the artistic medium, then toned her art with the software application ComicStudio. For the narrative, she explores the characters' pasts through dreams, and periodic, nonlinear flashbacks. Several character traits, such as Jackie's chocolate allergy, are presented to the reader through inference rather than exposition. Additionally, Kim uses a brief, untranslated Korean song alongside the predominantly English text. Critics have focused on the issues of love and loss. 12 Days primarily deals with \\"a love affair and its aftermath,\\" according to Dirk Deppey of The Comics Journal. He considered it \\"a meditation on loss,\\" which explores \\"a relationship neither fully ended nor easily forgotten by either party.\\" Theron Martin of Anime News Network considered it a story about \\"trying to find a way to cope with a devastating loss\\". According to Katherine Dacey, the former senior manga editor for PopCultureShock, 12 Days contains \\"lovely, quiet observations about the way we grieve, define family, express desire, and remember moments of hurt and betrayal.\\" Johanna Draper Carlson, a reviewer for Publishers Weekly, wrote that Jackie's action of consuming the ashes serves as \\"a transition period, a way to indulge her grief and then a time to be able to be herself again.\\" AfterEllen.com's editor-in-chief Karman Kregloe stated that the comic \\"explores the impact of loss, and how relationships are supported and broken in times of grief.\\" To a lesser extent, critics also discussed the lesbian aspect. Martin felt that the lesbian element of 12 Days had been addressed, without becoming overstated. Casey Brienza, a fellow reviewer for Anime News Network, suggested that the shame Jackie and Noah felt as lesbians \\"ultimately destroyed their relationship.\\" In her comparison of Alison Bechdel's 2006 graphic memoir Fun Home and 12 Days, Erica Friedman, the founder of the lesbian-themed anime convention Yuricon, considered neither story to be \\"lesbian narratives\\", but rather \\"narratives of grief, of relationships and of missed opportunities for communication and closeness.\\" Production Partially modeled on a story told to Kim by a stranger, 12 Days began during her sophomore year in college as a way of coping with the end of a relationship. Kim soon abandoned the unfinished comic after moving on emotionally from the breakup, and considered the early concept \\"poorly built.\\" After completing her junior year in college in Seoul, South Korea, where she had been studying Japanese language and literature, Kim moved to New York, United States. There, she attended the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan, New York, for four years, and graduated in 2002 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in cartooning. In addition to illustrating the cover of Australian rock band Jet's 2003 debut album Get Born, she had three of her short comics published in anthologies: \\"SheepSheepSleep\\" (2003) in Broad Appeal, \\"B-612\\" (2003/4) in New Thing Vol.2, and \\"Repeat\\" (2005) in SheWolf Vol.1. At the 2004 San Diego Comic-Con International, she encountered now-former Tokyopop editors Mark Paniccia and Lillian M. Diaz-Przybyl, who helped to pitch 12 Days to their publisher. Kim later expressed surprise for her successful pitch of 12 Days, and commented: \\"It made me believe there is room for diverse stories.\\" Resuming work on 12 Days in early 2005, Kim felt that her \\"slow speed, other projects and family matters\\" delayed its production. Additionally, the South Korean-native Kim, who speaks Korean, English, and Japanese fluently, would think of ideas in Korean that did not translate well over to English, ultimately leading her to change her method of thinking for the comic. She considered her creation of a global manga \\"a bit ironic,\\" because she \\"wanted to do something different from manhwa or manga,\\" which she had grown up around. Completed in the middle of August 2006, 12 Days was published by Tokyopop in North America in November of the same year. However, in May 2011, Tokyopop shut down its North American branch, with the status of global manga titles left unclear. 12 Days is also published in Germany by Tokyopop Germany. Reception 12 Days received generally positive reviews from critics. Caroline Ryder of The Advocate, a LGBT-interest magazine, highlighted 12 Days as \\"a dark, deeply emotional graphic novel.\\" Brienza complimented Kim's artistic attention to the background and setting's details, and summed up the comic as \\"a sensitive depiction of lesbians that strives for literariness\\". While not personally enjoying the comic, Friedman considered it \\"excellent and well worth reading.\\" Noting the potentially confusing flashbacks, Martin stated: \\"12 Days doesn't easily fall into any of the normal manga (or manga- like) categories. It avoids any kind of sensationalism in providing a mature piece about a difficult topic, which may limit its appeal but certainly makes it worth reading.\\" While Deppey praised it as \\"an ambitious and partly satisfying work that very nearly succeeds,\\" he considered it not \\"as daring or complex a work\\" as Fun Home. Although Dacey disliked the backgrounds and the \\"self-consciously literary\\" ashes-in-beverages aspect, she enjoyed the plot and Kim's use of naturalism in her artwork. She later placed it on her list of the top ten global manga. Draper Carlson recommended it, commenting: \\"The emotions the book carries will be familiar to anyone who's suffered a loss in love. It's a work to meditate on.\\" Conversely, A. E. Sparrow of IGN wrote that the story sacrificed its coherency in its attempt \\"for a deeper level of understanding\\"; Sparrow concluded: \\"12 Days is simply trying too hard, burying some absolutely beautiful illustrations in a sea of chaotic storytelling.\\" Notes References :General * :Specific External links *12 Days at Tokyopop's official site via Internet Archive *June Kim's official website Category:2006 graphic novels Category:Tokyopop titles Category:Yuri (genre) comics Category:2000s LGBT literature ","title":"12 Days"},{"id":"8031181","text":"A computer-on-module (COM) is a type of single-board computer (SBC), a subtype of an embedded computer system. An extension of the concept of system on chip (SoC) and system in package (SiP), COM lies between a full-up computer and a microcontroller in nature. It is very similar to a system on module (SOM).  Design  COMs are complete embedded computers built on a single circuit board.Typical COM product line The design is centered on a microprocessor with RAM, input/output controllers and all other features needed to be a functional computer on the one board. However, unlike a single-board computer, the COM usually lacks the standard connectors for any input/output peripherals to be attached directly to the board. The module usually needs to be mounted on a carrier board (or \\"baseboard\\") which breaks the bus out to standard peripheral connectors. Some COMs also include peripheral connectors. Some can be used without a carrier. A COM solution offers a dense package computer system for use in small or specialized applications requiring low power consumption or small physical size as is needed in embedded systems. As a COM is very compact and highly integrated, even complex CPUs, including multi-core technology, can be realized on a COM. Some devices also incorporate field-programmable gate array (FPGA) components. FPGA-based functions can be added as IP cores to the COM itself or to the carrier card. Using FPGA IP cores adds to the modularity of a COM concept, because I/O functions can be adapted to special needs without extensive rewiring on the printed circuit board.Technologic Systems FPGA based COM modules A \\"computer-on-module\\" is also called a \\"system-on- module\\" (SOM). \\"computer-on-module\\". PCMag Encyclopedia. \\"Computer on Module\\". \\"System on Module (SOM)\\". Critical Link definitions. \\"Make or Buy: System on Modules and Small Board Computers\\".  History  The terms \\"Computer-on-Module\\" and \\"COM\\" were coined by market researcher Venture Development Corp (VDC) and first appeared in VDC's report on the Global Market for Merchant Computer Boards in Real-time and Embedded Applications,Global Market for Merchant Computer Boards in Real-time and Embedded Applications report published in November 2001. The terms became more prominent upon industry standardization of the COM Express format in 2005. There is no clear \\"first Computer-on-Module\\" product, since numerous small component-like single board computers were already on the marketCOM-like Linux capable boards, announced prior to 2005 when VDC initially introduced the term. COM Express is just one of many standardized Computer-on-module formats. Other open-spec COM standards include SMARC, Qseven, ESM, XTX, and eTX. Additionally, many manufacturers offer COMs with proprietary formats. Some proprietary COM formats have modified SODIMM and MXM edge-connector style designs, while others have arbitrary rectangular dimensions along with various types of high density board-to-board connectors .Gumstix launch PRInforce Micro SoMs Notably, the Raspberry Pi Compute Module is designed in a 200-pin SODIMM format.  Benefits  Using a carrier board is a benefit in many cases, as it can implement special I/O interfaces, memory devices, connectors or form factors. Separating the design of the carrier board and COM makes design concepts more modular, if needed. A carrier tailored to a special application may involve high design overhead by itself. If the actual processor and main I/O controllers are located on a COM, it is much easier, for example, to upgrade a CPU component to the next generation, without having to redesign a very specialized carrier as well. This can save costs and shorten development times. However, this only works if the board-to-board connection between the COM and its carrier remains compatible between upgrades. Other benefits of using COM products instead of ground-up development include reducing time to market (TTM), risk reduction, cost savings, choice of a variety of CPUs, reduced requirements and time for customer design, and the ability to conduct both hardware and software development simultaneously.Computer on Modules - Technical Reference Manuals  See also  * COM Express * CoreExpress * Embedded System Module * ESMexpress * ETX (form factor) * Qseven * SMARC * XTX References Category:Microcomputers Category:Embedded systems ","title":"Computer-on-module"},{"id":"8031182","text":"The Kufra tragedy occurred in May 1942 during World War II, when eleven of twelve South African aircrew flying in three Bristol Blenheim Mark IV aircraft of No. 15 Squadron of the South African Air Force died of thirst and exposure, after the flight became lost following a navigational error near the oasis of Kufra in Libya and made a forced landing in the Libyan Desert. The deployment to Kufra A Royal Air Force Bristol Blenheim Mark IV similar to those involved in the Kufra incident being serviced in the Middle East ca. 1942. The South African Air Forces No. 15 Squadron, equipped with Bristol Blenheim Mark IV aircraft, departed South Africa in January 1942 for service in Egypt in support of Allied forces in the North African campaign of World War II. Arriving in Egypt in February 1942, it set up operations south of Amreya, near Alexandria. Only two men in the squadron ‚Äì its commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel H. H. Borckenhagen and Captain J. L. V. de Wet ‚Äì had experience in desert operations.Coetzee, J. J. M. \\"The Tragedy at Kufra.\\" Military History Journal, Vol. 12, The South African Military History Society, December 2001 Higher command decided that the squadron would send a detachment of aircraft to the oasis at Kufra, deep in the Libyan Desert in southeastern Libya, where they were to support Allied ground forces garrisoning Kufra with aerial reconnaissance, air defence, and attacks on any approaching Axis forces in the squadrons first combat assignment in the campaign. On 8 April 1942, 47 ground staff departed for Kufra, making a journey by train, river steamer, and ground vehicle; they arrived on 25 April. The newly promoted Major de Wet, who was placed in command of the detachment, meanwhile flew to Kufra on 11 April to make final arrangements for the detachments arrival. No. 15 Squadron selected its three best Blenheims ‚Äì Z7513, Z7610, and T2252 ‚Äì for the detachment. Each carrying a three-man crew, they arrived at Kufra on 28 April 1942, flying from Amariya via Wadi Halfa to avoid passing over enemy-held territory. Upon arrival, they found that the direction-finding station at Kufra was not functioning properly. Back in Amariya, Lieutenant Colonel Borckenhagen, who had no direct communications with Kufra, asked Royal Air Force Headquarters in the region to pass orders to de Wet on his behalf to keep the detachment grounded until the direction-finding station was made fully operational. The flight By the evening of 3 May 1942, the direction- finding station was back in working order, and Major de Wet briefed his crews on their first familiarisation flight, on which he would lead them early the following morning. The flight ‚Äì to be made at a true air speed of 150 mph (242 km/hr) and intended to allow the crews to become familiar with landmarks in the area and to gain experience with desert flying ‚Äì was to take off in the early hours of 4 May and follow roughly a square path, with its first leg one of 83 miles (134 km) from Kufra to Rebiana, Libya, on a course of 269¬∞, followed by a second leg of 51.5 miles (83 km) on bearing 358¬∞ to Bzema, then a third leg of 64 miles (102 km) on bearing 63¬∞ to Landing Ground 07 (LG07), and finally on bearing 162¬∞ for the 83.5-mile (134-km) leg back to Kufra, with arrival at Kufra expected at 07:42 hours. In addition to its crew of three, each plane would carry a fourth man ‚Äì an armourer ‚Äì to assist with armament aboard the aircraft during the flight. The cockpit of a Bristol Blenheim Mark IV on display at the Imperial War Museum Duxford in August 2005.After receiving an early-morning weather report for the region which predicted a visibility of 2.5 miles (4 km) and wind from a bearing of 60¬∞ at a speed of 19 to 24 mph (30 to 39 km/h) at 1,600 feet (488m), de Wet declined a weather balloon check of wind conditions and the three Blenheims, each with four men aboard, took off from Kufra. After initial communications checks with Kufra, nothing was heard from the aircraft until 7:10 hours. In the meantime, the three Blenheim crews believed that they had successfully completed their flight, identifying each waypoint and planning to arrive at Kufra between 07:33 and 07:42 hours. However, Allied personnel at Rebiana did not hear them fly past, suggesting that they already were off course by the time they thought they had completed the first leg of their flight. A contributing factor may have been that a weather balloon launched shortly after they took off revealed that the earlier weather report was wrong, and that winds at 2,200 feet (670 m) actually were blowing at 31 mph (50 km/h) from a bearing of 290¬∞, and one of the navigators aboard the planes noted that the flight was so bumpy that he was unable to take drift readings. At 07:10, Kufra finally heard from the Blenheims, when aircraft Z7610 requested a bearing, and Kufra requested that it transmit dashes so that the direction-finding station could establish its bearing; the aircraft did not respond. At 07:27, Major de Wets Blenheim, Z7513, requested a course for a return to Kufra, but its radio operator ceased broadcasting before the direction-finding station could determine its bearing; after taking a snap bearing, Kufra radioed 120-3=0527, meaning that the aircraft should \\"steer 120¬∞ (zero wind) third-class fix, time 05h27 GMT,\\" but the aircraft appears only to have heard the numbers 3-0-5 and as a result believed the course to base was 305¬∞. The aircraft turned to this course at 07:42, and Allied infantrymen at Taizerbo heard them fly past to the west; at 08:10 they turned 180¬∞ to fly on the reciprocal bearing, 125¬∞. After T2252s starboard engine began to malfunction around 09:00 hours, Major de Wet ordered the aircraft to land in the desert, which they did successfully at 09:15. The search Bristol Blenheim Mark IVs, the same of type of aircraft forced down in the Kufra incident. =4 May= The Blenheim crews conferred and concluded that they were only about 20 miles (32 km) from Kufra. At 11:00, a crew took off in Z7610 and flew southwest, but returned at 11:30 having failed to find Kufra. After transferring fuel from the disabled T2252, a crew again took off in Z7610 and flew on a heading of 213¬∞ for about 24 miles (40 km), but returned at 11:40 without having sighted Kufra. A third flight leaving at 15:35 hours flew on a course of 240¬∞ ‚Äì which would have led it to Kufra ‚Äì but turned back after 81 miles (130 km), before reaching Kufra. The crews made no further attempts to find their base that day. Apparently assuming imminent rescue, they consumed a great deal of water during their first day in the desert. By midday, Kufra was aware that the three Blenheims must have landed somewhere in the desert. Occasional weak signals from the aircraft during the day were inadequate to establish their bearing. Ground search parties were organised at Rebiana, Bzema, and LG07, and various direction-finding stations monitored possible signals from the missing aircraft. Ground searches began based on doubtful bearings taken during the day. =5 May= The downed Blenheim crews made two more unsuccessful flights seeking Kufra on 5 May. Flying Z7513 using fuel transferred from T2252, one crew flew on a bearing of 90¬∞ for about 45 miles (72 km); after its return, it departed again on a flight of 96 miles (160 km) on a bearing of 290¬∞ with three men aboard, but was forced down by fuel exhaustion 24 miles (40 km) north of the other two stranded Blenheims. Evidence discovered when searchers found Z7513 four days later suggested that its crew had landed twice during this flight, but apparently had not attempted to rejoin the other Blenheims on the last of their fuel before making their second and final landing. Meanwhile, most of the various ground search parties returned to report their lack of success, and the requirement for an air search became obvious. =6 May= The Libyan Desert landscape in southern Libya. The nine men stranded with Z7610 and T2252 had used up almost all of their water by the morning of 6 May. Major de Wet himself took off in Z7610 to search on a bearing of 290¬∞, but returned without success. Meanwhile, three Bristol Bombays of the Royal Air Forces No. 216 Squadron began an air search, but encountered a sandstorm that grounded them for the next two days. The sandstorm aggravated the plight of the men with the stranded Blenheims; those with Z7610 and T2252 began to die during the afternoon. =7‚Äì11 May= The sandstorm continued through 7 May and into 8 May, when visibility finally began to improve. Major de Wet recorded on 8 May that only six men remained alive out of the 12, and expressed concern that the men might shoot one another or him; later in the day he observed that only two men were left alive besides him. At various times between 5 and 9 May, ground search parties came to within 2 miles (3.5 km) of Z7610 and T2252 and within 5 miles (8 km) of Z7513, but limited visibility prevented them from finding the downed Blenheims. On 9 May, with the sandstorm finally over, a Vickers Wellington sighted Z7513 and landed alongside it. Its crew found the Blenheims three-man crew lying in the shade of its wing, all apparently dead since 8 May. On 11 May, the same Wellington found Z7610 and T2252 parked nose-to-nose at either or .The Coetzee narrative cites both positions without explanation for the apparent contradiction. As the Wellington approached, a survivor, Air Mechanic N St M Juul, stumbled out of the shade of a wing and started to put out some ground strips to attract attention. He was too feeble to pull the trigger of a Verey pistol. The Wellington landed alongside Blenheims Z7610 and T2252 and Juul took a few shaky steps towards his rescuers but collapsed in the hot sand. The bodies of Major de Wet and seven of his men were found around the aircraft, some with gunshot wounds. Though terribly weak, Air Mechanic Juul, the lone survivor from the flight's 12 crew, was recovered and flown to Kufra for medical attention and later testified at the S.A.A.F/R.A.F. Court of Enquiry. Aftermath =Inquiry= An inquiry into the incident took place at Kufra from 1 to 4 June 1942. The board of inquiry attributed the incident to the crews lack of experience in desert flying; their failure to keep accurate navigators logs; and the failure of wireless operators to perform their duties during the flight. The board placed the responsibility for the forced landing on the crew of the leading aircraft, Z7513 flown by Major de Wet. The board attributed the failure of the ground and air searches to a lack of accurate information regarding the possible position of the aircraft; the difficult terrain; the sandstorm; problems with unserviceable aircraft that could not carry out search functions assigned to them; and poor signal organisation. It also found that the downed Blenheim crews did little to assist the searchers in finding them because the crews engaged in bad direction-finding procedures even after landing and failed to employ visual signals and smudge fires. The inquiry also identified reasons for the early death of the stranded aviators, finding that they failed to appreciate their plight or to ration water immediately and that they made unintelligent use of compass alcohol, having drunk it despite its poisonous qualities, and fire extinguishers, which they had sprayed on themselves for temporary relief from the heat resulting in the infliction of painful skin injuries. To avoid any recurrence of the Kufra incident, the board made comprehensive recommendations with regard to equipment to be carried on aircraft likely to fly over the desert and emergency procedures in the event of forced landings in the desert. It also recommended that only experienced crews operate from Kufra, and that strict procedures be established for operations from Kufra to ensure that aircraft not become lost in the first place and be more easily located if forced down. =Bodies and aircraft= The search parties buried the three men found with Z7513 next to the plane, and the eight men found dead around Z7610 and T2252 at their discovery site. In May 1942, Z7610 and T2252 were repaired and flown back to Kufra. T2252 later suffered engine failure and crashed near Kufra, but Z7610 operated with No. 15 Squadrons detachment there until 27 November 1942, when the detachment departed Kufra to return to the squadron. By that time, the squadron had converted to Bristol Bisleys ‚Äì the Mark V ground-attack variant of the Blenheim ‚Äì so the detachment left Z7610 behind at Kufra to be repaired by a Royal Air Force Maintenance Unit (MU) and flown to Khartoum in the Sudan. Its engines overboosted and unflyable, Z7513 was abandoned where it lay. After an Axis air raid on Kufra on 25 September 1942, it was cannibalised for spare parts to repair a Bisley damaged in the raid. In February 1959, a geological survey party rediscovered Z7513, and the bodies of its three crewmen were exhumed and reburied in Knightsbridge War Cemetery at Acroma, Libya. When de Wet's nephew visited the site again in November 2001, Z7513 was found to have been destroyed by scavenging, with its engines, propellers, and undercarriage missing. The bodies of the eight men found with Z7610 and T2252 remained where the search party buried them in the Libyan Desert in May 1942 until 1963 when they were reinterred in Knightsbridge War Cemetery.

Regarded for his talent for writing sports films, Jeff Maguire got his first screenwriting break with his script Escape to Victory, a film about soccer directed by John Huston in 1981. His most recent contribution is Gridiron Gang, released in 2006. Maguire's most famous film is In the Line of Fire starring Clint Eastwood and directed by Wolfgang Petersen, for which he received a Best Original Screenplay Oscar nomination for 1993. In 1990, Maguire was approached by producer Jeff Apple to develop Apple's Secret Service agent concept into a film treatment. Maguire was in debt to his relatives and about to have his utilities turned off when his script based on Apple's concept, \\"In the Line of Fire,\\" went into a bidding war between Tom Cruise, Sean Connery, and Clint Eastwood. When he received a call from Eastwood congratulating him on the completed deal (over $1,000,000.00) Jeff's wife reportedly had to return a dress so they could afford to go out to dinner to celebrate. Prior to this, various moguls had rejected and almost destroyed the story. Dustin Hoffman cleverly added the hero's guilt over failing to save JFK, then exited; Tom Cruise's people demanded this be deleted, because a 28-year-old hero would not have been around for JFK. The dead-broke writer spurned about $100,000 from Cruise, but wound up with Clint Eastwood and about $1,000,000. Jeff Maguire is a graduate of Hampshire College, Amherst, Massachusetts. Raised in Greenwich, Connecticut, Maguire was once a railroad worker, a waiter, and a volunteer counselor with Mother Teresa's group, Missionaries of Charity, in the Pico- Union section of downtown Los Angeles, working primarily with Hispanic gangs. In the 1980s and 90s, he also frequented the famous Manhattan Beach, California video store Video Archives, where future filmmakers Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary were clerks.

The Hennebique system was one of the first appearances of the modern reinforced- concrete method of construction. Ch√¢tellerault bridge, bottom of picture Hennebique had first worked as a stonemason, later becoming a builder, with a particular interest in restoration of old churches. Hennebique's B√©ton Arm√© system started out by using concrete as a fireproof protection for wrought iron beams, on a house project in Belgium in 1879. He realised however, that the floor system would be more economic if the iron were used only where the slab was in tension, relying on the concrete in the compression areas.McBeth, Douglas: \\"Francois Hennebique (1842‚Äì1921) ‚Äì Reinforced concrete pioneer\\", Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, 1998 His solution was reinforced concrete ‚Äì a concrete slab with steel bars in its bottom face. His business developed rapidly, expanding from five employees in Brussels in 1896, to twenty-five two years later when he moved to Paris. In addition, he had a rapidly expanding network of firms acting as agents for his system. These included L.G. Mouchel and F.A. Macdonald & Partners in Britain, and Eduard Zublin in Germany.McBeth, op.cit. He was asked in 1896 by Hector Guimard for the terrace of the armory Coutolleau in Angers. The first building erected using this system was the 1897 Weaver Building in what was then the Docks area of Swansea, but it was demolished in 1984 when the docks were redeveloped to make way for the Maritime Quarter development. A column from the fifth floor of the original building was preserved by the Science Museum, with another piece going to Amberley Museum. Another fragment lies by the side of the river Tawe, where a plaque commemorates Hennebique and his achievement. Between 1892 and 1902, over 7,000 structures were built using the Hennebique system, including buildings, water towers and bridges. Most of these were by other firms licensing the technology, although Hennebique designed some structures himself, including the 1899 bridge at Ch√¢tellerault (pictured).Billington, David P.: \\"The Tower and the Bridge\\", Princeton University Press, 1983 See also Joseph Monier Notes External links and sources * *CIVL 1101 ‚Äì History of Concrete Construction ‚Äì Course material at University of Memphis *Information on the S.S.

Named after Raja Joginder Sen, the hill station is the terminus of the Kangra Valley narrow-gauge railway. Jogindernagar is the third-largest city in the district. The only city in Asia with three hydro-electric power stations, its nickname is \\"The City of Powerhouses\\". In the central Joginder Nagar Valley, the region is known for paragliding and trekking, mountain biking and camping. The valley is known for its Ts: trolley, trout and train. In 2015, Jogindernagar was declared the first free Wi-Fi city in Himachal Pradesh.facility/articleshow/47106669.cms Jogindernagar to become first town of State with free wi-fi facility Etymology Jogindernagar was named after the Mandi king Raja Joginder Sen. Its original name was Sukrahatti. History In 1925, Raja Joginder Sen and Col. B. C. Batty planned a hydropower scheme near the village of Sukrahatti. Alexander Sanderson was chief engineer until December 1929, when he returned to England with the project half-completed.John Sanderson's biography, planned publication 2018. Narrow-gauge railway track was laid from Pathankot to Jogindernagar‚Äîabout ‚Äîto carry heavy machinery transported from Britain. A haulage system was laid from the Shanan Power House site to Barot, where a reservoir was built on the Uhl River. After tunneling and piping the water several kilometres from the river to Jogindernagar, the 110-MW Shanan Power House was built by a team of engineers headed by Batty. It was the only hydroelectric project in northern India which fed undivided Punjab and Delhi. upright The hydroelectric scheme planned to build five power stations with water from the Uhl River. Water from the Shanan Power House was be by tunnels to adjoining Siyuri Dhar. A reservoir was be built in the village of Chapprot to drive turbines at the base of Chapprot Hill in stage two of the project. However, the plan was abandoned after Batty's death. During the 1960s, the Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board revived the plan. Another set of turbines was added at Bassi (a small village at the bottom of Chapprot Hill) in 1970, and the 66-MW Bassi Power House was built. Despite the Bassi Power House's economy (since it was based on tailwater from the Shanan project), no further development was made until the beginning of the 21st century. Construction of the project's third stage, the 100-MW Uhl Stage III, is ongoing in the village of Chulla (near Tullah) with two reservoirs: one near Machhyal Lake and another in the village of Raktal (near Chulla). Until the mid-20th century, Jogindernagar was northern India's largest potato market. The potato-growing valleys were not linked by roads; over 2,000 mules from the Lahaul and Spiti valleys transported potatoes from outlying areas to Jogindernagar, the only railhead in that part of the state. Potatoes from Mandi, Kullu and Lahaul and Spiti districts were brought there for transport to West Bengal. Rock salt Jogindernagar was India's only supplier of rock salt, obtained from the Gumma and Drang mines. Residents of the Kullu Valley travelled for days to obtain the salt, crossing the high-altitude Bhubhu Pass (since the road network did not yet exist).

It was founded by Saint Charles Borromeo, who built a Franciscan convent (now used by the Pontifical French Seminary) and the church within the ruins of the Baths of Agrippa in 1592. It was restored in 1627, but at some later point the roof collapsed and it was abandoned. In 1883, the Congregation of the Holy Spirit acquired the property, and rebuilt the church, giving it a new facade designed by Luca Carimini in 1888. On the lower of the two levels, the main door is framed by two columns holding a semicircular tympanum with a decorated lunette. To the sides are niches with triangular tympanums, surmounted by circular windows. On the upper level there are seven windows surmounted by busts of saints.

Yalalevu is mostly a residential area but there are sugar cane farms in the areas not within the town boundary, although some areas within the town boundary is also used for cane farming. There are a few light industries in the area as well. There are two schools, Arya Kanya Pathshala and Ba Muslim Primary School within the town boundary and Ba Muslim Secondary School outside the town boundary. The main highway, King's Road passes through the settlement. A number of famous people were either born in Yalalevu or spent a significant part of their life in the settlement. * Ramgarib Singh and Randhir Singh, responsible for the formation of the short-lived but first cane growers union in Fiji in 1919, Indian Cane Growers Association, owned land in Yalalevu which they used for cane farming. * The brothers Parmanand Singh and Chattur Singh also lived in Yalalevu and used it as a base to further their political aspirations. * Ayodhya Prasad tried to make his fortune in cane farming in Yalalevu, but soon learnt of the realities of sugar cane farming in Fiji in the 1930s. This led to his forming the Kisan Sangh. * Vijay R. Singh was born and grew up in Yalalevu, and attended Arya Kanya Pathshala where his teacher was Ami Chandra, who made valuable contribution to education, sports and politics in Fiji. * NFP Youth, and later Labour, Parliamentarian Davendra Singh was born and bred in Yalalevu and so was USP academic Anirudh Singh. * Sidiq Koya's family also acquired free-hold land in Yalalevu and moved closer to town from rural Ba.

Relaxases are responsible for site- and strand- specific nicks in double-stranded DNA. Known relaxases belong to the rolling circle replication (RCR) initiator superfamily of enzymes and fall into two broad classes: replicative (Rep) and mobilization (Mob). The nicks produced by Rep relaxases initiate plasmid or virus RCR. Mob relaxases nick at origin of transfer (oriT) to initiate the process of DNA mobilization and transfer known as bacterial conjugation. Relaxases are so named because the single-stranded DNA nick that they catalyze lead to relaxation of helical tension. Structure and mechanism Known relaxases are metal ion dependent tyrosine transesterases. This means that they use a metal ion to aid the transfer of an ester bond from the DNA phosphodiester backbone to a catalytic tyrosine side chain, resulting in a long-lived covalent phosphotyrosine intermediate that essentially unified the nicked DNA strand and the enzyme as one molecule. Preliminary reports of relaxase inhibition by small molecules that mimic intermediates of this reaction were first reported in 2007. Such inhibition has implications related to preventing the propagation of antibiotic resistance in clinical settings. The first relaxase x-ray crystal and NMR structures ‚Äì of Rep relaxases from tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) and adeno associated virus serotype 5 (AAV-5) ‚Äì were solved in 2002. These revealed compact molecules composed of five-stranded, antiparallel beta sheet cores and peripheral alpha helices. A histidine-rich motif, previously identified by sequence conservation, was shown to be a metal ion binding site located on the beta sheet core, nearby the carboxy-terminal catalytic tyrosine residue. Later structures of the Mob relaxases TrwC from plasmid R388 and TraI from the F-plasmid confirmed that the Mob and Rep classes are evolutionarily related to one another through circular permutation. This means that they share a general fold, but the amino-terminal sequence of one is homologous to the C-terminus of the other, and vice versa. Thus the Catalytic tyrosines of TraI and TrwC are amino-terminal rather than carboxy-terminal. Etymology Relaxase nomenclature is varied. In conjugative bacterial plasmids, Mob-class relaxases go by names such as TraI (in plasmid RP4), VirD2 (pTi), TrwC (R388), TraI (F-plasmid), MobB (CloDF13), or TrsK (pGO1).

Instead of arithmetic operations in numerical equations, the variables are joined by language operations. Among the most common operations on two languages A and B are the set union A ‚à™ B, the set intersection A ‚à© B, and the concatenation A‚ãÖB. Finally, as an operation taking a single operand, the set A* denotes the Kleene star of the language A. Therefore language equations can be used to represent formal grammars, since the languages generated by the grammar must be the solution of a system of language equations. Language equations and context-free grammars Ginsburg and Rice gave an alternative definition of context-free grammars by language equations. To every context-free grammar G = (V, \\\\Sigma, R, S), is associated a system of equations in variables V. Each variable X \\\\in V is an unknown language over \\\\Sigma and is defined by the equation X=\\\\alpha_1 \\\\cup \\\\ldots \\\\cup \\\\alpha_m where X \\\\to \\\\alpha_1, ..., X \\\\to \\\\alpha_m are all productions for X. Ginsburg and Rice used a fixed-point iteration argument to show that a solution always exists, and proved that i.e. any other solution must be a of this one. For example, the grammar S \\\\to a S c \\\\mid b \\\\mid S corresponds to the equation system S = ( \\\\\\\\{ a \\\\\\\\} \\\\cdot S \\\\cdot \\\\\\\\{ c \\\\\\\\} ) \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{ b \\\\\\\\} \\\\cup S which has as solution every superset of \\\\\\\\{ a^n b c^n \\\\mid n \\\\in \\\\mathcal{N} \\\\\\\\}. Language equations with added intersection analogously correspond to conjunctive grammars. Language equations and finite automata Brzozowski and Leiss studied left language equations where every concatenation is with a singleton constant language on the left, e.g. \\\\\\\\{a\\\\\\\\} \\\\cdot X with variable X, but not X \\\\cdot Y nor X \\\\cdot \\\\\\\\{a\\\\\\\\}. Each equation is of the form X_i=F(X_1, ..., X_k) with one variable on the right-hand side. Every nondeterministic finite automaton has such corresponding equation using left-concatenation and union, see Fig. 1. If intersection operation is allowed, equations correspond to alternating finite automata. Fig. 1: A finite automaton with associated system of equations S_1 = 1 \\\\cdot S_1 \\\\cup 0 \\\\cdot S_2 \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{\\\\epsilon\\\\\\\\}, S_2 = 1 \\\\cdot S_2 \\\\cup 0 \\\\cdot S_1 where \\\\epsilon is the empty word. Baader and Narendran studied equations F(X_1, \\\\ldots, X_k)=G(X_1, \\\\ldots, X_k) using left-concatenation and union and proved that their satisfiability problem is EXPTIME-complete. Conway's problem Conway proposed the following problem: given a constant finite language L, is the greatest solution of the equation LX=XL always regular? This problem was studied by Karhum√§ki and Petre who gave an affirmative answer in a special case. A strongly negative answer to Conway's problem was given by Kunc who constructed a finite language L such that the greatest solution of this equation is not recursively enumerable. Kunc also proved that the greatest solution of inequality LX \\\\subseteq XL is always regular. Language equations with Boolean operations Language equations with concatenation and Boolean operations were first studied by Parikh, Chandra, Halpern and Meyer who proved that the satisfiability problem for a given equation is undecidable, and that if a system of language equations has a unique solution, then that solution is recursive. Later, Okhotin proved that the unsatisfiability problem is RE-complete and that every recursive language is a unique solution of some equation. Language equations over a unary alphabet For a one-letter alphabet, Leiss discovered the first language equation with a nonregular solution, using complementation and concatenation operations. Later, Je≈º showed that non-regular unary languages can be defined by language equations with union, intersection and concatenation, equivalent to conjunctive grammars. By this method Je≈º and Okhotin proved that every recursive unary language is a unique solution of some equation.

The tablet uses an additional push layer that expands as water enters the tablet via the osmotic membrane. The drug is expelled via the laser-drilled hole visible on the left side of the tablet. The osmotic-controlled release oral delivery system (OROS) is an advanced controlled release oral drug delivery system in the form of a rigid tablet with a semi-permeable outer membrane and one or more small laser drilled holes in it. As the tablet passes through the body, water is absorbed through the semipermeable membrane via osmosis, and the resulting osmotic pressure is used to push the active drug through the laser drilled opening(s) in the tablet and into the gastrointestinal tract. OROS is a trademarked name owned by ALZA Corporation, which pioneered the use of osmotic pumps for oral drug delivery. Rationale =Pros and cons= Osmotic release systems have a number of major advantages over other controlled-release mechanisms. They are significantly less affected by factors such as pH, food intake, GI motility, and differing intestinal environments. Using an osmotic pump to deliver drugs has additional inherent advantages regarding control over drug delivery rates. This allows for much more precise drug delivery over an extended period of time, which results in much more predictable pharmacokinetics. However, osmotic release systems are relatively complicated, somewhat difficult to manufacture, and may cause irritation or even blockage of the GI tract due to prolonged release of irritating drugs from the non- deformable tablet. Oral osmotic release systems =Single-layer= An illustration of the different components of the Elementary Osmotic Pump. The Elementary Osmotic Pump (EOP) was developed by ALZA in 1974, and was the first practical example of an osmotic pump based drug release system for oral use. It was introduced to the market in the early 1980s in Osmosin (indomethacin) and Acutrim (phenylpropanolamine), but unexpectedly severe issues with GI irritation and cases of GI perforation led to the withdrawal of Osmosin. Merck & Co. later developed the Controlled-Porosity Osmotic Pump (CPOP) with the intention of addressing some of the issues that led to Osmosin's withdrawal via a new approach to the final stage of the release mechanism. Unlike the EOP, the CPOP had no pre-formed hole in the outer shell for the drug to be expelled out of. Instead, the CPOP's semipermeable membrane was designed to form numerous small pores upon contact with water through which the drug would be expelled via osmotic pressure. The pores were formed via the use of a pH insensitive leachable or dissolvable additive such as sorbitol. =Multi- layer= An illustration of the different components of the Push-Pull Osmotic Pump. Both the EOP and CPOP were relatively simple designs, and were limited by their inability to deliver poorly soluble drugs. This led to the development of an additional internal \\"push layer\\" composed of material (a swellable polymer) that would expand as it absorbed water, which then pushed the drug layer (which incorporates a viscous polymer for suspension of poorly soluble drugs) out of the exit hole at a controlled rate. Osmotic agents such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride, or xylitol are added to both the drug and push layers to increase the osmotic pressure. The initial design developed in 1982 by ALZA researchers was designated the Push-Pull Osmotic Pump (PPOP), and Procardia XL (nifedipine) was one of the first drugs to utilize this PPOP design. An animation illustrating the exterior/interior compositions of a tablet of Concerta, a PSOP OROS design. In the early 1990s, an ALZA-funded research program began to develop a new dosage form of methylphenidate for the treatment of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Methylphenidate's short half-life required multiple doses to be administered each day to attain long-lasting coverage, which made it an ideal candidate for the OROS technology. Multiple candidate pharmacokinetic profiles were evaluated and tested in an attempt to determine the optimal way to deliver the drug, which was especially important given the puzzling failure of an existing extended-release formulation of methylphenidate (Ritalin SR) to act as expected. The zero-order (flat) release profile that the PPOP was optimal at delivering failed to maintain its efficacy over time, which suggested that acute tolerance to methylphenidate formed over the course of the day. This explained why Ritalin SR was inferior to twice-daily Ritalin IR, and led to the hypothesis that an ascending pattern of drug delivery was necessary to maintain clinical effect. Trials designed to test this hypothesis were successful, and ALZA subsequently developed a modified PPOP design that utilized an overcoat of methylphenidate designed to release immediately and rapidly raise serum levels, followed by 10 hours of first-order (ascending) drug delivery from the modified PPOP design. This design was called the Push- Stick Osmotic Pump (PSOP), and utilized two separate drug layers with different concentrations of methylphenidate in addition to the (now quite robust) push layer.

At an early age he entered the Benedictine community of the Blessed Trinity at Vend√¥me in the diocese of Chartres; and in 1093, while still very young and only a deacon, was chosen abbot of the community. During all his lifetime he showed a great attachment to the Holy See. Thus, in 1094, he went to Rome in order to help Pope Urban II (1088‚Äì99) to take possession of the Lateran, still held by the faction of the antipope Clement III (1080‚Äì1100); the money which he offered to the custodian brought about the surrender.Mary Stroll, Calixtus II (1119-1124): A Pope Born to Rule (), p. 271 In compensation he was created a cardinal-priest by Urban II, with the titular church of St. Prisca on the Aventine. No less than twelve times did he make the journey to Italy in the interest of the Church of Rome during the pontificates of Urban II, Paschal II (1099‚Äì1118), and Callistus II (1119‚Äì24); and on three occasions he was made a captive. In 1096 and 1107 he extended the hospitality of his monastery to Popes Urban and Paschal. He took part in the councils held at Clermont in 1095, by Pope Urban; at Saintes, in 1096, by the Apostolic Legate Amatus of Bordeaux; and at Reims, in 1131, by Innocent II (1130‚Äì43). He also strenuously defended the ecclesiastical principles in the question of investitures, which he qualified in several small tracts as heresy and simony; he wrote in the same spirit to Pope Paschal II when the latter made concessions (1111) to Emperor Henry V (1106‚Äì25). Finally, he always defended firmly the prerogatives, the rights, and the property of his abbey at Vend√¥me against the encroachments of either bishops or secular princes. Geoffrey was one of the distinguished men of his age, and was in correspondence with many eminent personalities of that time. His writings consist of a number of letters; of a series of tracts on the investitures of ecclesiastics by laymen, on the Sacraments of the Holy Eucharist, Baptism, Confirmation, and Extreme Unction, on ascetic and pastoral subjects; hymns to the Blessed Virgin and St. Mary Magdalene; sermons on the feasts of Our Lord, the Blessed Virgin, Mary Magdalene, and St. Benedict.

Baisarov was shot dead on the street in central Moscow by members of the Chechen extra-agency guard on November 18, 2006. Career During the separatist regime of Aslan Maskhadov, Baisarov was a minor field commander whose forces operated in the Grozny area, described by the Russian Grani.ru website as a \\"prominent 'Wahhabi'\\".WILL KADYROVITES REJOIN REBELS?, The Jamestown Foundation, May 19, 2004 When the Second Chechen War began, he became attached to Akhmad Kadyrov, who was mufti of Chechnya at the time. Baisarov's former rebels turned into Kadyrov's bodyguards and Baisarov became the commander of the Chechen Presidential Security Service. In 2004 when Akhmad Kadyrov, the president of Chechnya at the time, was assassinated in a bomb attack, his security force was disbanded. Baisarov's people turned into the secretive Gorets ('Highlander') paramilitary unit, subordinate to the tactical department of the North Caucasus FSB and based in the hamlet of Pobedinskoye (Pobedinskoe), north-west of Grozny. According to Chechen human rights activists, its main function was kidnapping operations and summary executions. In Chechnya it had a reputation of a death squad and Baisarov was believed to maintain a prison and torture chamber in the village. Conflict with Ramzan Kadyrov At the end of 2005, the regional FSB was closed down under pressure from Chechen authorities. At that time, Chechen Prime Minister Ramzan Kadyrov decided to dissolve Gorets unit as well and reassign its members to various law enforcement structures under his control. Baisarov was counting on support from his former FSB managers to let him maintain the unit, perhaps by making its members a special unit of Chechen MVD's extra-agency guard department, which he would lead. When Baisarov refused to be subordinate to Ramzan Kadyrov, his forces were blockaded at their base in Pobedinskoye and the Chechen prosecutor brought back the 2004 criminal case against Baisarov. At that time, ten members of the local Musaev (Musayev) family were kidnapped and killed in Grozny; they were later found in a mass grave. The prosecutor and Chechen UBOP established that members of the Gorets unit kidnapped them and that Baisarov personally shot some of them with a noiseless VSS Vintorez sniper rifle. According to investigators, Baisarov thus avenged the death of his brother Sharani, who also served in Akhmad Kadyrov's personal security service and died with him in the bomb blast. Baisarov denied his involvement in the murder of the Musaev family members and was eventually declared wanted on those charge but only as a witness. Chechen prosecutors did not place Baisarov on a federal wanted list, and the Chechen MVD only did so three days before Baisarov died but he was also formally not charged with anything. There are also questions about the jurisdiction: if Baisarov was really a senior officer in the FSB (he had identification in his pocket showing him to be a Lieutenant Colonel of the FSB), the military prosecutor or the FSB itself should have summoned him for questioning, not the civil prosecutor. Death in Moscow Baisarov went to Moscow and appeared in the Russian media saying that Ramzan Kadyrov was trying to hunt him down to get rid of possible competition. He accused the young Kadyrov of directing numerous political murders and kidnappings. At the same time, he told Kommersant that he was not hiding from anyone in Moscow and was expecting to return to Chechnya soon to become the deputy prime minister in charge of law enforcement. The situation changed a few days before the death of Baisarov, as up to 50 Chechen police officers -formed into two groups specially to eliminate him- arrived in Moscow from Chechnya. Some information indicates that the group was being overseen personally by Adam Delimkhanov, the first deputy prime minister of Chechnya. The arrival of the Chechen group in Moscow had been preceded by negotiations with the top leaders of Russian law enforcement agencies. Baisarov's FSB guard was suddenly removed, and several of his comrades were taken into custody and sent back to Chechnya. On November 14, some 33 last Gorets fighters in the republic were disarmed. Three days later unknown persons destroyed two of three oil wells controlled by Baisarov outside Pobedinskoye just one day before his death. People close to Baisarov say that he spent last week calling his former managers from the dissolved regional FSB. Allegedly, Baisarov intended to give evidence that would prove his innocence and, at the same time, show his political opponents' guilt of kidnappings and murders, and give testimony about his knowledge in the Anna Politkovskaya assassination; however, the last contact he had with the Lubyanka ended with him being told: \\"The program is closed. Don't call anymore.\\" Movladi Baisarov was killed at about 6:00 p.m, when he arrived in a Russian VAZ-1111 car at 30 Leninsky Prospekt apparently for a prearranged meeting. Witnesses say that Baisarov got out of his car and approached a group of plainclothed Chechens standing nearby. When they recognized Baisarov, who was unshaven and wearing a black jacket, they shouted at him and then fired on him with automatic weapons. Most of the bullets struck him in the head. The assailants then fled by car in the direction away from the city center. The circumstances surrounding the \\"special operation\\" on Leninsky Prospekt were so strange that the Prosecutor's Office in Moscow was compelled to initiate a criminal investigation of Baisarov's death. A prosecutor's spokesman told Kommersant that the investigation was looking for the reason the operation was carried out by Chechen police, using the \\"methods of their republic\\", instead of Moscow police. The prosecutor's office has classified Baisarov's killing as murder and determined that he suffered 11 bullet wounds. The investigation has determined that seven of those wounds were made by the AKS-74U assault rifle belonging to Sultan Rashayev, lieutenant in the extra-agency guard service. It was not known who else shot at Baisarov, but shells from both assault rifles and standard-issue police pistols were also found at the scene of the crime, as were shells from a Stechkin APS machine pistol. Most of the shots were fired at point blank range.

The feature-length film was produced at Mutual's studios in Santa Barbara, California. It was part of Mutual Film Corporation's Masterpicture series, which were based on works of prominent fiction; the story was written by Kenneth B. Clarke. The Abandonment was released June 15, 1916. The 1916 film publications Motography and The Moving Picture World both described the production's plot as \\"unusual\\" and \\"original\\". Rosson, at age 17, was already an experienced film actress when she was cast to costar in the film. Motography called her performance \\"refreshing\\". Cast *Forrest Taylor (E. Forrest Taylor) as Dr. Edmund B. Stewart *Helene Rosson as Emily Thurston *Harry von Meter as Benson Heath Plot Dr. Edmund B. Stewart is a talented young physician who is working hard to build both his professional reputation and practice. He is engaged to Emily Thurston, whose father is said to be wealthy. The Thurstons move in the best social circles and Emily is congratulated because her fianc√© is a successful man. Emily loves Edmund, but is unhappy at the amount of time he spends working at his practice. Stewart's work schedule has caused her to miss many social engagements. Emily grows resentful that his dedication to duty has curtailed so much of her social life; she starts spending time with Benson Heath. Heath, who has no real job, is attracted to Emily because he believes her family is quite wealthy. He has recently lost a considerable amount of money through bad investments. Heath convinces Emily to break her engagement to Edmund Stewart and asks her to marry him. Stewart, who had been driving himself to work harder, is at the point of exhaustion. Emily and Heath's marriage is the final blow to his constitution; he becomes ill. His doctors advise him to go to the country for recuperation. On the journey, Stewart sees two tramps who appear to be quite happy; he decides to see if this type of life might make him happy also. He takes off his tie, tears off his shirt collar and falls in with the tramps. The tramps later steal Stewart's money and then he has no recourse but to remain a tramp. Emily thought she heard something but does not see the tramps. Six months after her marriage, Emily's father dies and it is learned he was not a wealthy man as was assumed. Heath becomes quite angry when he learns that his father in law left no large inheritance. He passes a check on his already overdrawn bank account, uses the money for gambling, and then takes Emily away to avoid being arrested. The couple moves West to a house in a desolate location. The area is deserted enough that two tramps show up and set up camp not for from the home. The tramps find their way into the house, planning to loot it. Their plans are foiled by Heath's returning home, so they hide in a closet. He is drunk and when Emily tries to take the bottle away from him, he erupts into a rage. Hearing the noise, the tramps wonder what is happening, so they carefully open the closet door a bit to see. Heath is choking Emily and the tramps are horrified at the sight. One of them bolts out of the closet and wrestles with Heath to free Emily from his grasp. As the two men struggle, Heath's gun discharges and he is fatally shot. The tramps flee, but are apprehended by the sheriff. Stewart, who has been living in the tramp camp, comes up to try helping his friends. When he enters the house he sees Heath lying dead on the floor and Emily also lying there, but in a dead faint. Stewart thinks Emily has shot her husband so he tells the sheriff he is responsible for Heath's death. When Emily regains consciousness, she tells the sheriff that Stewart was not the man who struggled with her husband. As Stewart is being released by the sheriff, Emily recognizes him and tells him she always loved him; no charges were filed in the death of Heath as the sheriff's opinion is that Heath got what he deserved.

The youngest person to become president was Friedrich Ebert (age 48 years, 7 days). The oldest person to become president was Paul von Hindenburg (age 77 years, 222 days). The oldest living is former president Joachim Gauck, born 24 January 1940 (age ). The youngest living is former president Christian Wulff, born 19 June 1959 (age ).

An iconoclastic performer, Cognito had been compared to Lenny Bruce, Bill Hicks, and Jerry Sadowitz but never achieved success in the mainstream media, in part at least due to his reputation for being a hellraiser. He won the Time Out Award for Stand-up Comedy in 1999.  Biography  Cognito was born in London of Irish and Italian ancestry. He first performed stand-up in 1985 and likened arriving at his stage name to Dr Jekyll creating Mr Hyde. By so openly embracing his excesses‚Äîsuch as throwing a television set out of a hotel window (\\"room service was late\\")‚Äîhe quickly became known as Britain's \\"most banned\\" comic. Early on, his act involved bringing a hammer on stage, banging a nail into a wall and hanging a hat off it, followed with the lines, \\"This lets you know two things about me [...] firstly, I really don't give a shit. Secondly, I've got a hammer.\\" He explained: > I was always pushing the envelope. I regret the dangerous ones and tried not > to be too shocking (because that is easy to do). If I did shock, there was > always a reason for what I did, even if it was taking my knob out. I was > building a contradictory reputation as a dodgement and a great compere. If I > was booked, the promoter could no longer plead ignorance. I was sometimes > stepping over the line, if not during the show, then afterwards. In fact, I > was getting away with murder. Good job I was funny. His autobiography was originally published on his website in 1995 then revised and updated for Kindle in 2013. He billed it as \\"the best book about comedy I have ever writ\\". Cognito was the father of British actor Ollie Barbieri (born 1991), who played JJ Jones in the British teen drama Skins.  Death  On 11 April 2019, Cognito suffered a heart attack and collapsed on stage during his set in Bicester. Since Cognito joked about having a heart attack a few minutes earlier, this was initially thought by the audience to be a part of the act, until emergency services were called in. The audience was evacuated and paramedics declared him dead at the scene. He was widely praised across the comedy community, including by Jimmy Carr, Matt Lucas, and Katy Brand.

Under Chavez's leadership, the Center for Equal Opportunity has released dozens of studies documenting the extent to which race is a factor in college admissions at over 60 colleges and universities.

They have assembled resources to aid those interested in monitoring the process, and have a list of organisations that specialize in these issues. They also take an active stance in concern to the voting rights of rehabilitated felons. They believe the right to vote should be reinstated after the fulfillment of the sentence, under the condition they go through a process of review. Clegg believes that ex-felons' voting rights should not be restored automatically, but rather on a case-by-case basis. =Other issues= The center also focuses on other issues related to race and ethnicity. Some issues that have come to light include the continual usage of desegregation policies that are 50 years old and hinder school effectiveness, usage of disparate impact laws that damage neutral policies and practices, and the issue of reparations for those that have been discriminated against.

Holt said that Rosemary Anne Sisson wrote so \\"we knew exactly how it felt to be politician, a VAD or the wife of a serving officer in 1916\\".

The fruit is a drupe weighing up to 3.0 grams. Propagation is by seeds that germinate in 60‚Äì120 days, with slow growth. Production begins when the tree is 3‚Äì4 meters high, after about 6 years. The fruits has a rounded dark red to purple shell and creamy white flesh, rich in oil of a pale yellow color. Bacaba fruit are cooked to prepare a juice which is much sought after by local people, though generally less popular than a√ßa√≠. Bacaba fruit is agreeable and its flavor is reminiscent of avocado. The fruits are rich in natural phenols, especially in flavonoids and their red color is due to cyanidin hexosides. Cultivation The tree grows in well-drained sandy soils of the Amazon basin. Form optimal germination, seeds should be planted at a depth of 2 cm in sand and vermiculite, and the temperature kept around 30 ¬∞C. Seeds should be kept moist but rather than wet. Other information The seeds and the remains of the macerated pulp are fed to pigs and poultry. Leaves are used for house interiors while trunks provide tough wood suitable for construction. The city of Bacabal in Maranh√£o was so called because of the large amount of existing Bacaba fruit there. References Further reading *Schultes, Richard E. (1974).

Gynes are those destined to become queens, whereas female workers are typically sterile and cannot become queens. A colony with multiple queens is said to be a polygyne form, whereas with only one is a monogyne form. The fire ant Solenopsis invicta is known to have colonies in both polygyne and monogyne forms. The small red ant, Leptothorax acervorum, has colonies that switch from monogyny to polygyny as a result of seasonal fluctuations. The little fire ant Wasmannia auropunctata produces unique kinds of meiotic oocytes with a drastic reduction in recombination. These oocytes may either fuse together for gyne production (automictic parthenogenesis with central fusion) or be fertilized by male gametes for the production of workers. In the wasp species Apoica flavissima queens display distinct morphological differences from the sterile worker class. In Ropalidia plebeiana, gynes do not stay in the nest after they emerge as adults, but may spend their winters in their maternal nests. In species lacking morphological castes (i.e., where \\"workers\\" may not be sterile), the term \\"gyne\\" is usually reserved for those females whose entire life is spent as a reproductive or potential reproductive, as opposed to those who start life as a worker and subsequently attain reproductive status (often called a \\"replacement queen\\" or a \\"laying worker\\"). These can be seen in certain species of stingless bee like the Plebeia remota where both gynes and workers are capable of reproducing. In most species with annual colony cycles, only gynes can enter diapause and overwinter, while workers ‚Äì both non- reproductive and reproductive ‚Äì die off. In some groups, such as paper wasps, gynes join with other gynes at the time of nest founding, and may be relegated to subordinate reproductive roles, so being a gyne does not guarantee that a female will become a queen.

Originally established to provide qualified teachers to Catholic schools, it gradually expanded and now offers foundation, undergraduate, and postgraduate degrees in a range of humanities and social sciences. Previously known as Leeds Trinity & All Saints, the institution became a university college in 2009 after gaining the right to award its own degrees, and was granted full university status in December 2012. The university is a member of the Cathedrals Group and the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities. History Trinity and All Saints College, 1999 Leeds Trinity opened in 1966 as two Roman Catholic teacher training colleges for Yorkshire - Trinity College for women and All Saints College for men. At the time there was a great demand for new teachers in Britain due to the post- war baby boom. Trinity College was composed of three residential halls to accommodate the female students: Shrewsbury (named after the birthplace of Elizabeth Prout), Whitby (Saint Hilda, who was Abbess of Whitby), and Norwich (Julian of Norwich). Located near these halls was a convent occupied by the Sisters of the Cross and Passion. All Saints College, meanwhile, was built on the south side of the campus, with four halls constructed for male students: Fountains and Rievaulx (after Fountains Abbey and Rievaulx Abbey), St Albans (Alban), and Ripon (Wilfrid, Bishop of Ripon). Both colleges appointed separate principals: Augusta Maria, a Manchester University physics graduate and former deputy head of a Grammar School, was put in charge of Trinity College, while Andrew Kean, a Deputy Director of the Leeds University Institute of Education, became the first principal of All Saints. The colleges merged in 1980 to form Trinity and All Saints College, with one principal appointed for the new unified college - biochemist Dr Mary Hallaway. In November 1970 Kean informed the governors that the colleges should diversify and offer other courses in order to survive - although the driving purpose of the institution would remain as preparing Catholic teachers for Catholic schools. As a result, new academic divisions were introduced including Humanities, Modern Languages, Mathematics and Sciences and Social and Environmental Sciences, enabling students to specialise in another subject in addition to their teacher training. The Postgraduate Certificate in Education was introduced for prospective secondary school teachers. After the merger in 1980, the College was forced to justify courses deemed uneconomical. Consequently, course content was modified and efforts made to increase student numbers without diluting the College's Catholic identity. However, cuts still forced the closure of the Linguistic and Arts departments, with the Music, Science and Drama departments eventually meeting the same fate. Despite this student numbers gradually increased over the remainder of the decade. During the 1990s Trinity & All Saints once again found itself in challenging circumstances. It faced increased competition from newer universities such as Lincoln, Huddersfield, and Leeds Metropolitan - all of which had been granted university status in 1992. On top of this, the government of John Major had continued a policy of spending reductions on smaller university colleges. Nonetheless, academic provision was able to expand, particularly in Communications and Media, and by 1998 the College numbered nearly 2,000 undergraduates and 250 postgraduates. In 1991 Leeds Trinity was designated a College of the University of Leeds, and established a formal accreditation agreement with the university in 2001. In 2009 Leeds Trinity gained taught degree awarding powers from the Privy Council, and became a university college with the right to award its own degrees. In 2011 students at the new university college held the longest running sit-in in the country as a protest against the national increase in tuition fees. In November 2012, following the government's announcement that the qualifying threshold for university title will be lowered from 4,000 to 1,000 students, it was announced that it would be recommended to the Privy Council that 10 institutions, including Leeds Trinity, should be granted university status. The change of title was made in December 2012. In 2016 Leeds Trinity marked its 50th anniversary by holding a Mass at Westminster Cathedral. A series of high-profile guest lectures was announced. Among them was Nobel Peace Prize winner Mairead Maguire, who delivered a talk about her experiences during The Troubles. Campus and facilities Leeds Trinity is a campus university off Brownberrie Lane in Horsforth, close to the village of Rawdon. The campus is 6 miles (10 km) from Leeds city centre. Horsforth railway station is a 15-minute walk away, and trains into Leeds city centre also take 15 minutes. In 2009-10 the campus underwent major developments and refurbishment, most notable being the new student accommodation block All Saints Court, with 198 bedrooms. View from the sports fields =Accommodation= There are eight Halls of Residence on campus at Leeds Trinity. These include All Saints Court, which is a ¬£6m development of 198 bedrooms with ensuite and self-catered facilities that was opened in September 2010. =Library= Leeds Trinity's library is housed within the Andrew Kean Learning Centre and gives students access to over 500,000 electronic books and 115,000 print volumes, including a large classroom resources section to support students on teaching practice. There are 24-hour facilities. =Laboratories= There is a fully equipped sports science laboratory and a separate nutrition and food preparation laboratory. Both offer facilities for physiology, fitness testing, sport psychology practicals, dietary analysis and practical work with food. For Psychology students, there are a number of laboratories which include a Biopsychology and Psychophysiology Research Laboratory, a Human Assessment Laboratory, a Cognitive Psychology Laboratory, a Developmental / Social Psychology Laboratory and a Forensic Psychology Laboratory. =The Media Centre= Leeds Trinity has a three camera TV studio and a second smaller TV studio also used for photography shoots. There is an edit training lab with a choice of Avid and Final Cut Pro editing software. A radio studio, computer suite with Adobe Audition and other specialist software and a supply of flashmics are available and students can borrow cameras and relevant location recording accessories. The Media Centre has undergone a major refit in recent years, with upgrades to both the building and equipment. The Centre is now fully digital for video and audio operations, and students are able to shoot in HD following the purchase of broadcast quality JVC and Sony portable cameras. In addition, the centre has a fully fitted suite of Apple Mac computers, two HD compatible TV studios and a network for all individual edit areas, with a 48 terabyte shared storage server. Building on the development of the Media Centre, Leeds Trinity's Centre for Journalism has developed two additional multimedia newsrooms ‚Äì one for undergraduate and one for postgraduate studies. =Primary education classrooms= Primary education classrooms have resources available for to practice with the equipment used in schools including interactive whiteboards, early years resources, ICT suites, art and DT resources. =Sports facilities= Leeds Trinity's sports centre was refurbished and extended in 2007. Its indoor facilities include a sports hall, a fully fitted fitness suite with free weights area, two treatment rooms, a movement and spin studio, a gymnasium (incorporating dance studio facilities) and two squash courts. Leeds Trinity outdoor sports facilities include 3 full-size rugby/football pitches, 6 dedicated tennis courts, 2 multi-use hard courts and a running track. In 2012, Leeds Trinity opened a new 3G All Weather Pitch. The pitch is the latest generation of 3G synthetic turf accredited by FIFATM for football and the FIHTM for Hockey. Local football team AFC Horsforth now trains on the pitch each Saturday. Organisation and structure Leeds Trinity is an independent Roman Catholic foundation, and until earning the right to award its own degrees in 2009 was accredited by the University of Leeds. Overall responsibility for the activities of Leeds Trinity University rests with its Board of Governors. The ex officio Chair of the Board is the Rt Revd. Marcus Stock, Roman Catholic Bishop of Leeds. The Board delegate the day-to-day management of Leeds Trinity to Margret House (Vice-Chancellor), who is advised by the Executive Team, consisting of Prof. Ray Lloyd (Deputy Vice-Chancellor), Phill Dixon (Chief Operating Office) and David Butcher (Director of Finance and University Secretary). In addition the Board of Governors delegates oversight of the academic function of the university to the Academic Board. The Vice-Chancellor is an ex officio member of the Board of Governors and the Chairperson of the Academic Board. The University's Chancellor, installed on 15 June 2018, is actor and playwright Deborah McAndrew. Academic profile Leeds Trinity had students in , almost all of whom are full-time. The ratio of male/female students is 35/65. A professional work placement is offered with every degree, through links Leeds Trinity maintains with local business, industry and schools. Foundation year programs are available for prospective students who may not already hold the required qualifications for university study. They are currently offered in Sport, Social Science, Law studies, and Computing. =Rankings and reputation= In the latest editions of the main university ranking guides, Leeds Trinity was ranked outside the top 100 in The Complete University Guide - being placed 108th in the country out of 131 listed institutions. It was rated somewhat higher in The Guardian league table, placing 85th out of 121 institutions. The university performed best in The Times/The Sunday Times table, finishing equal 67th alongside De Montfort University in Leicester out of 129 listed institutions. It is notable that Leeds Trinity is mainly a teaching institution and because of this has a low research output - contributing to a lower position in the major tables. In the 2014 Research Excellence Framework it was ranked 145th out of 154 for research power, with only 20 research staff. The university has traditionally performed better in other criteria, such as teaching quality. In the 2018 The Times/The Sunday Times University league table it was ranked in the top 10 for both teaching quality and student experience, and was ranked 39th for the percentage of students achieving either a first or a 2:1 during their degrees. In 2016 overall satisfaction from students was 81% (National Student Survey 2016), with 100% satisfaction in some courses such as Business and Management, English and Media. Research Leeds Trinity is the home of a number of research centres and research projects. =Leeds Centre for Victorian Studies= Established in 1994, the LCVS is one of the longest-established and most active Victorian Studies centres in Britain. As well as sponsoring the publication of the Journal of Victorian Culture and the Leeds Working Papers in Victorian Studies, it runs an MA in Victorian Studies, and sponsors a full programme of seminars, one day colloquia and residential conferences. =Schools History Project= The Schools History Project is a curriculum development project focussing on history education in the 13-16 age range. The Project holds an annual conference, sponsors in-service training, publishes a regular bulletin, and collaborates with John Murray Ltd in the publishing of materials to support the SHP curriculum. Links with industry =Leeds Trinity Business Network= The Leeds Trinity Business Network is an opportunity for local businesses to network, raise profiles, and work together to support local business. Piloted in 2011, it currently has 80+ members. =Centre for Journalism partnerships= Leeds Trinity is the current holder of the BBC North Education Partnership Achievement award, given in recognition of its 'inspirational' journalism teaching, and Leeds Trinity news trainees have won the Partnership's Journalism award in two years out of the preceding three. Leeds Trinity works closely with the BBC to give its students access to a wide range of placements, challenges, workshops and other opportunities based at MediaCity in Salford and at BBC Yorkshire in Leeds. At the core of the Centre for Journalism's provision are extended periods of live and as-live newsroom operation, giving students a real understanding of working to deadline.

It took part in Israel's first elections in 1949, crossing the electoral threshold by just 53 votes, and winning one seat, which was taken by Zecharia Glosca. Despite the influx of Yemenite Jews to the country precipitated by Operation Magic Carpet, a mass airlift of Jews into Israel from Yemen in 1949‚Äì50, the party failed to attract new voters and again won only one seat in the 1951 elections, though this time the electoral threshold was beaten by over a thousand votes. The party's seat was taken by Shimon Garidi. On 10 September 1951 the party was merged into the General Zionists. On 26 June 1955 Garidi announced that he had seceded from the General Zionists to reform the party, but the move was not recognised by the house committee. The party fought the 1955 elections independently, but did not win a seat. It also contested elections in 1959 (under the name \\"Yemenite Faction\\", winning 1,711 votes), 1973 (3,195 votes) and 1988 (909 votes), but failed to cross the electoral threshold. A later merger of the General Zionists and the Progressive Party led to the formation of the Liberal Party, which became the third largest in the Knesset in the 1961 elections.

Career He was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He grew up with American jazz and classical music in the house because his uncle played guitar, lived next door, and visited frequently. Lubambo tried classical piano for two years but quit. At thirteen, he picked up the guitar and taught himself how to play because there was no one else around to do it. The following year he joined a band and performed professionally for the first time. From 1972 to 1977, he attended the Villa-Lobos School of Music to study classical guitar. He went to college and got a degree in engineering in 1980, but he pursued music instead. After moving to the U.S. in 1985, he worked with singer Astrud Gilberto. During the next year, he met Herbie Mann, who Lumbero considered \\"my American father, my mentor for life.\\" He formed Trio da Paz with Duduka da Fonseca and Nilson Matta and has recorded and toured with them.

Church interior. Santi Marcellino e Pietro al Laterano is a Roman catholic parish and titular church in Rome on the Via Merulana. It is dedicated to Saints Marcellinus and Peter, 4th century Roman martyrs, whose relics were brought here in 1256. History The first church on the site was built by Pope Siricius in the 4th century, close to the Via Labicana's catacombs of Marcellinus and Peter, with an adjoining hospice which became a centre for pilgrims. This church was restored by Pope Gregory III in the 8th century. Ever since these early centuries, it has been among Rome's stational churches for the Saturday of the Second Week in Lent. In the ninth century, the remains of Saints Marcellinus and Peter putatively were transferred from the catacombs here to a church in Seligenstadt, Germany. When the church was rebuilt in 1256 by Pope Alexander IV, the martyrs' relics were putatively returned. At Present, under the high altar is an urn containing relics of Saint Marcia. On the left side is an altar dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, with a copy of Guido Reni's The Virgin in Glory with Angels, St Joseph and St Rita. Next to it is the Chapel of Reconciliation. An image of the dedicatees was placed on the first column on the left from the entrance during this restoration, with an inscription recording the restoration. The hospice and church were then given in 1276 to the Confraternity of those Commended to the Saviour. The present church is the result of Pope Benedict XIV's 1751 reconstruction. The present cube-shaped exterior is divided by pilaster strips in a Neoclassical style, but with a late-Baroque elements, including a dome influenced by the architecture of Borromini. The fa√ßade was designed by Girolamo Theodoli and the main altarpiece by Gaetano Lapis depicts the dedicatees' martyrdom. After that restoration, the church was awarded until 1906 for the worship of the Discalced Carmelites. A small chapel to Our Lady of Lourdes was dedicated at the south east, next to a chapel of St Gregory the Great, with a new ceiling painting of her by N. Caselli, in 1903. Since 1911, it has been a parochial church served by diocesan clergy. The church has a Greek cross plan. This church is a titular church of Czech cardinal Dominik Jaroslav Duka, O. P.

Diver was the codename for the V-1, against which the defence consisted of anti-aircraft guns, barrage balloons and fighter aircraft. The British Double-Cross System used Double agents to plant false information about the accuracy of the V-1 bombardment. Anti-aircraft guns proved the most effective form of defence in the later stages of the campaign, with the aid of radar-based technology and the proximity fuse. The V-1 campaign from ground launch sites ended by the middle of 1944 with the Allied occupation of the launch sites. Diver Plan The Diver Plan was prepared in early 1944 following the first reports of the weapon in April 1943 and the discovery of its intended launch sites in late 1943. The plan had to be flexible enough to cover the anticipated assault on Britain and the needs of Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Europe. The V-1 offensive began on the sixth day after the D-Day landings on the beaches of Normandy, with the message \\"Diver, Diver, Diver\\". Defences that had been guarding the embarkation ports for the invasion were redeployed against the V-1. Defences =Anti- aircraft guns= Anti-aircraft guns were redeployed in several moves: first in mid-June 1944 from positions on the North Downs to the south coast of England; then a cordon closing the Thames Estuary to attacks from the east. In September 1944 a new linear defence line was formed on the coast of East Anglia, and finally in December there was a further layout along the Lincolnshire-Yorkshire coast. The deployments were prompted by the ever- changing approach tracks of the missiles which were determined by the Allied advance through Western Europe. Anti-aircraft gunners found that such small, fast-moving targets were difficult to hit. At first, it took an average of 2,500 shells to bring down a V-1. The average altitude of the V-1, between was in a narrow band above the optimum engagement height range for light 40mm Bofors guns. The rate of traverse of the standard British QF 3.7 inch mobile gun was too slow for the heights at which V-1s flew and static gun installations with faster traverses had to be built at great cost. The development of centimetric (roughly 30 GHz frequency) gun laying radars based on the cavity magnetron and the development of the proximity fuze helped to neutralise the advantages of speed and size which the V-1 possessed. In 1944 Bell Labs started delivery of an anti-aircraft predictor fire-control system based around an analogue computer (supplanting the previous electro-mechanical Kerrison Predictor) just in time for use in the campaign. Technological advances By mid-August 1944, the threat was all but overcome by the expedited arrival of two enormously effective electronic aids for anti- aircraft guns, the first developed by the Radiation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT Rad Lab) radar-based automatic gunlaying (using, among others, the SCR-584 radar) and the proximity fuze. Both of these had been requested by Anti-Aircraft Command and arrived in numbers, starting in June 1944, just as the guns reached their free-firing positions on the coast. Seventeen per cent of all flying bombs entering the coastal gun belt were destroyed by guns in the first week on the coast. This rose to 60 per cent by 23 August and 74 per cent in the last week of the month, when on one day 82 per cent were shot down. The rate increased from one V-1 for every 2,500 shells fired to one for every hundred. =Barrage balloons= Barrage balloons were also deployed against the missiles but the leading edges of the V-1's wings were equipped with balloon cable cutters and fewer than 300 V-1s are known to have been destroyed by hitting cables. =Aircraft= Part of the area which the Divers had to cover was given over for fighter operations. Most fighter aircraft were too slow to catch a V-1 except in a dive and even when intercepted, the V-1 was difficult to bring down. Machine-gun bullets had little effect on the sheet steel structure and 20 mm cannon shells were explosive projectiles; detonating the warhead could destroy the fighter as well. The V-1 was nearly immune to conventional air- combat techniques because of its design, which dispensed with a pilot and piston engine with a cooling system. One hit on the pilot or oxygen system can force an abort or cause the destruction of a normal aeroplane but there is no pilot in a cruise missile. The Argus pulse jet of the V-1 could be shot full of holes and still provide sufficient thrust for flight. The only vulnerable point was the valve array at the front of the engine and the only vulnerable points on the V-1 were the bomb detonators and the line from the fuel tank, three very small targets inside the fuselage. An explosive shell from a fighter's cannon or anti-aircraft gun was the most effective weapon, if it could hit the warhead. A Spitfire using its wing tip to 'topple' a V-1 flying bomb When the attacks began in mid-June 1944 there were fewer than 30 Hawker Tempests in No. 150 Wing RAF to defend against them. Few other aircraft had the low-altitude speed to be effective. Early attempts to intercept V-1s often failed but techniques were rapidly developed. These included the hair-raising method of using the airflow over an interceptor's wing to raise one wing of the Doodlebug, by sliding the wing tip under the V-1's wing and bringing it to within six inches (15 cm) of the lower surface. Done properly, the airflow would tip the wing of the V-1 upwards, overriding the buzz bomb's gyros and sending it into an out of control dive. At least three V-1s were destroyed this way. The Tempest wing was built up to over 100 aircraft by September; P-51 Mustangs and Griffon-engined Spitfire XIVs were polished and tuned to make them almost fast enough and during the short summer nights the Tempests shared defensive duty with de Havilland Mosquitos. Modified P-47M Thunderbolts (half their fuel tanks, half their 0.5in {12.7 mm} machine-gun armament, all external fittings and all their armour plate removed) were also pressed into service against the V-1 menace. There was no need for radar in good weather ‚Äî at night the V-1's engine could be heard from or more away and the exhaust plume was like a beacon. (In poor visibility, radar-equipped Fleet Air Arm (FAA) Fairey Firefly night fighters of 746 Naval Air Squadron operated from RAF Ford). Wing Commander Roland Beamont had the 20 mm cannons on his Tempest harmonised at . This was so successful all other aircraft in 150 Wing were thus modified. In daylight, V-1 chases were often chaotic failures until a special defence zone between London and the coast was declared in which only the fastest fighters were permitted. Between June and mid-August 1944, the handful of Tempests shot down 638 flying bombs. One Tempest pilot, Squadron Leader Joseph Berry of No. 501 (Tempest) Squadron, destroyed fifty-nine V-1s and Beamont destroyed 31. Next most successful was the Mosquito (428), Spitfire XIV (303) and Mustang, (232). All other types combined added 158. The experimental jet-powered Gloster Meteor, was rushed half-ready into service in July 1944 to fight the V-1s, had ample speed but suffered from unreliable armament and accounted for only 13.

MI5 (by way of the Double Cross System) had these agents provide Germany with damage reports for the June 1944 V-1 attacks which implied that on average the bombs were travelling too far, while not contradicting the evidence presumed to be available to German planners from photographic reconnaissance of London. The bombs had been seeded with radio- transmitting samples to confirm their range but the results from these samples were ignored in favour of the false witness accounts and many lives may have been saved by the resulting tendency of future V-1 bombs to fall short. End of operations In September 1944, Duncan Sandys announced that the \\"Battle of London\\" against the V-1 was effectively over, as the launch sites in France had been overrun by Allied ground forces. The Germans had prepared sites in the Netherlands, from which they launched V-1 attacks against the Antwerp and Brussels starting in October 1944, against which Operation Vapour was mounted. V-2 bombardments began in September 1944 and the last enemy action of any kind on British soil in the war occurred on 29 March 1945, when a V-1 struck an empty field near Datchworth in Hertfordshire.

An analytic space is a space that is locally the same as an analytic variety. They are prominent in the study of several complex variables, but they also appear in other contexts.  Definition  Fix a field k with a valuation. Assume that the field is complete and not discrete with respect to this valuation. For example, this includes R and C with respect to their usual absolute values, as well as fields of Puiseux series with respect to their natural valuations. Let U be an open subset of kn, and let f1, ..., fk be a collection of analytic functions on U. Denote by Z the common vanishing locus of f1, ..., fk, that is, let Z = { x  f1(x) = ... = fk(x) = 0 }. Z is an analytic variety. Suppose that the structure sheaf of U is \\\\mathcal{O}_U. Then Z has a structure sheaf \\\\mathcal{O}_Z = \\\\mathcal{O}_U / \\\\mathcal{I}_Z, where \\\\mathcal{I}_Z is the ideal generated by f1, ..., fk. In other words, the structure sheaf of Z consists of all functions on U modulo the possible ways they can differ outside of Z. An analytic space is a locally ringed space (X, \\\\mathcal{O}_X) such that around every point x of X, there exists an open neighborhood U such that (U, \\\\mathcal{O}_U) is isomorphic (as locally ringed spaces) to an analytic variety with its structure sheaf. Such an isomorphism is called a local model for X at x. An analytic mapping or morphism of analytic spaces is a morphism of locally ringed spaces. This definition is similar to the definition of a scheme. The only difference is that for a scheme, the local models are spectra of rings, whereas for an analytic space, the local models are analytic varieties. Because of this, the basic theories of analytic spaces and of schemes are very similar. Furthermore, analytic varieties have much simpler behavior than arbitrary commutative rings (for example, analytic varieties are defined over fields and are always finite-dimensional), so analytic spaces behave very similarly to finite-type schemes over a field.  Basic results  Every point in an analytic space has a local dimension. The dimension at x is found by choosing a local model at x and determining the local dimension of the analytic variety at the point corresponding to x. Every point in an analytic space has a tangent space. If x is a point of X and mx is ideal sheaf of all functions vanishing at x, then the cotangent space at x is . The tangent space is , the dual vector space to the cotangent space. Analytic mappings induce pushforward maps on tangent spaces and pullback maps on cotangent spaces. The dimension of the tangent space at x is called the embedding dimension at x. By looking at a local model it is easy to see that the dimension is always less than or equal to the embedding dimension.  Smoothness  An analytic space is called smooth at x if it has a local model at x which is an open subset of kn for some n. The analytic space is called smooth if it is smooth at every point, and in this case it is an analytic manifold. The subset of points at which an analytic space is not smooth is a closed analytic subset. An analytic space is reduced if every local model for the space is defined by a radical sheaf of ideals. An analytic space X which isn't reduced has a reduction Xred, a reduced analytic space with the same underlying topological space. There is a canonical morphism . Every morphism from X to a reduced analytic space factors through r. An analytic space is normal if every stalk of the structure sheaf is a normal ring (meaning an integrally closed integral domain). In a normal analytic space, the singular locus has codimension at least two. When X is a local complete intersection at x, then X is normal at x. Non-normal analytic spaces can be smoothed out into normal spaces in a canonical way. This construction is called the normalization. The normalization N(X) of an analytic space X comes with a canonical map . Every dominant morphism from a normal analytic space to X factors through ŒΩ.  Coherent sheaves  An analytic space is coherent if its structure sheaf \\\\mathcal{O} is a coherent sheaf. A coherent sheaf of \\\\mathcal{O}-modules is called a coherent analytic sheaf. For example, on a coherent space, locally free sheaves and sheaves of ideals are coherent analytic sheaves. Analytic spaces over algebraically closed fields are coherent. In the complex case, this is known as the Oka coherence theorem. This is not true over non-algebraically closed fields; there are examples of real analytic spaces that are not coherent.  Generalizations  In some situations, the concept of an analytic space is too restrictive. This is often because the ground field has additional structure that is not captured by analytic sets. In these situations, there are generalizations of analytic spaces which allow more flexibility in the local model spaces. For example, over the real numbers, consider the circle . The circle is an analytic subset of the analytic space R2. But its projection onto the x-axis is the closed interval , which is not an analytic set. Therefore the image of an analytic set under an analytic map is not necessarily an analytic set. This can be avoided by working with subanalytic sets, which are much less rigid than analytic sets but which are not defined over arbitrary fields. The corresponding generalization of an analytic space is a subanalytic space. (However, under mild point-set topology hypotheses, it turns out that subanalytic spaces are essentially equivalent to subanalytic sets.)

According to Roger of Wendover, Ine founded the Schola Saxonum in AD 727. It included a hostel and a chapel dedicated to Santa Maria. In mediaeval times a substantial number of pilgrims from Wessex, including fighting men, traveled the Via Francigena from Canterbury to Rome.Merkle, Benjamin R. (2009-11-02). The White Horse King: The Life of Alfred the Great (Kindle Locations 266-275 and 366-370). Thomas Nelson. Kindle Edition. (Nashville Tennessee: Thomas Nelson Co. 2009) It was rebuilt in the 12th century and subsequently restored several times. In 1475 Pope Sixtus IV commissioned joining the church to the nearby Hospital of the Holy Spirit for foundlings (which Pope Innocent III had built and whose history is given in wall- paintings in the church's sacristy) and given a bell tower. In 1538‚Äì1545, Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, or Baldassare Peruzzi, rebuilt the church after it had been damaged during the Sack of Rome. An organ, which survives, was added in 1547. In 1585‚Äì1590, Pope Sixtus V had the exterior restored, giving the church its present fa√ßade by Ottavio Mascherino, inspired by a design of Sangallo. This facade has two stories, with Corinthian pillars dividing the lower one into five sections, and the upper divided into three sections. In the upper middle section is a circular window, and above that is the coat-of-arms of Pope Sixtus V. The fa√ßade is crowned by a pediment. It is a typical example of Renaissance architecture. In the stational procession for the first Sunday after the Octave of the Epiphany, instituted by Pope Innocent III (1198‚Äì1216), a procession carried the veil of Saint Veronica from Saint Peter's Basilica, and the Pope celebrated Mass in this church. Indulgences were granted to those who took part, and money was distributed to the poor. The inscriptions found in Santo Spirito in Sassia, a valuable source illustrating the history of the church, have been collected and published by Vincenzo Forcella.V. Forcella, Iscrizioni delle chiese e d'altri edifici di Roma, dal secolo XI fino al secolo XVI Volume VI (Roma: Fratelli Bencini, 1875), pp. 377-505. [in Italian and Latin] Art and architecture Plan of Church and adjacent hospital The church has a single nave, and ten apsidal chapels along the sides. The counter-facade has a Visitation (1545) by Marco Pino, and a Conversion of St. Paul begun by Francesco Salviati and completed by Francesco Rubiale. The first chapel to the right in the apse, has a fresco of the Pentecost by the Florentine Jacopo Zucchi and his brother. The second chapel has an Assumption by Livio Agresti, who also painted the Trinity in the fourth chapel as well as frescoes in the third chapel. The fifth chapel has an Annunciation and an Ascent (1570) by Giuseppe Valeriano. The sacristy is decorated by stories of the Schola Saxonum by Guidobaldo Abbatini. The apse is frescoed (1583) by both Jacopo and Francesco Zucchi. The fifth chapel on the left has a Martyrdom of St. John the Evangelist by Marcello Venusti. The second and first chapels contain paintings by Cesare Nebbia, including a Coronation of the Virgin.

Origin and development The Romanian buffalo breed originates from the Mediterranean type of water buffalo. Introgression has been made since 1960 from Murrah buffalo stock from Bulgaria. Herdbook was established in 1987. The Romanian population consists of three different buffalo types: Carpathian type, Danubian buffalo and the one improved through the Indian Murrah buffalo. The most numerous Romanian buffalos are the Carpathian type, which presents a valuable genetic resource, being well adapted to the cold climate. Population trend Their number is slightly decreasing. In 1994 the number of breeding female/male used for artificial insemination was 11800 (1,628 in herdbook)/ 5 bulls. In 1996 the number of total buffalo was 209,432, which were raised in 86,480 herds; the number of adult females was 97,320 and the number of adult males 2510. In 2003 the number of females in the herdbook was 275. External characteristics: The coat color is unicoloured in black, and the skin color is also black. Back line is sinuous, i.e. loin and tail point come lower than wither and crump height. Typical number of horns is two for both male and female; the horns are directed to the back, being 50-70 cm long. In adult animals (males/females) the wither heights are 140-142 / 131-133 cm. Live weights of adult animals (males/females) are 650-680 / 530-560 kg. Productive and reproductive traits Romanian buffalo, Bubalus bubalis Main uses are milk, meat and draught power. Milk yield varies according to season of calving, lactations number, level of feeding, and length of lactation. Lactation milk yield (kg) is between 958-1455 kg. The number of days lactation per year is 252-285; age at first calving is 38-42 months; average lactations number is 6-9; age at slaughter for young stock is 22-24 and 350-400 kg or at 3-4 months and 60-100 kg for males and the females are slaughtered at 500-600 kg, usually after the first lactation or after the productive life. In 2003 the female that was included in herd book had 1831 kg milk, with 136 kg fat (7.48%) and 71 kg (3.93%) protein. Age at first calving was 38 months and calving interval of these female was 456 days. The average of calves/year is 0.85. Management conditions The breed is very well adapted to the local environment. Type of management is stationary, housing is over 6-8 months / year and feeding is mixes. In most smallholders buffalos are maintained tied in closed barns in winter, while in warm seasons a combination between stable housing with grazing is practiced. The young buffaloes are kept for grazing on pasture. When pastured together, cattle and buffaloes coexist satisfactorily. Romanian buffalos are powerful swimmers.

He is best known for his motion picture title sequences, especially From Russia with Love and Goldfinger.  Early life  He was born to British parents on August 8, 1925 in Newark, New Jersey, where his father was a bus driver. In 1937, at age 12, his father died. Despite the comparative disinclination of his family, Brownjohn showed early artistic promise. After attending the Pratt Institute in nearby Brooklyn, New York for a year, he earned a place at the Institute of Design in Chicago, Illinois, formerly known as the New Bauhaus by founder L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy, in 1944. Regarded as a prodigy by his peers, Brownjohn became a prot√©g√© of Moholy-Nagy and his successor, Serge Chermayeff; much of the structural quality in Brownjohn's graphic design can be traced to the former's important influence. In his spare time, he experimented with marijuana and heroin (culminating in an early rehabilitation stint at the behest of Chermayeff) and often frequented the city's jazz clubs with Chermayeff and Buckminster Fuller, then an Institute faculty member. Because of his proclivities, Brownjohn became intimately acquainted with Charlie Parker, Billie Holiday and other musicians of the era. After receiving a nonprofessional B.A. in architecture in May 1948,https://robertbrownjohn.com/brownjohn-archives/institute-of-design-new- bauhaus-chicago-1944-1950/ Brownjohn initially worked as an architectural planner in Chicago before returning to the Institute (which had been absorbed as a unit of the Illinois Institute of Technology in 1949) to assist Chermayeff and teach his own courses in the school's evening division. He also worked as a freelance designer for several magazines, including Esquire and Coronet.  New York career  In 1951, Brownjohn returned to New York City in order to further his graphic design career. Continuing to work freelance for the next five years, he completed projects for a wide variety of clients, including Columbia Records. Brownjohn's effusive personality and fondness for jazz music allowed his friendships with Parker and Miles Davis, among others, to blossom as he became a part of the bohemian social scene in the city. Brownjohn also became addicted to heroin in earnest during this period. He was never to conquer this affliction and it contributed to his untimely death at the age of 44. In 1956, Brownjohn married Donna Walters. The couple went on to have a daughter, Eliza. The following year, Brownjohn formed Brownjohn, Chermayeff & Geismar (BCG) with fellow designers Ivan Chermayeff (a son of Brownjohn's mentor) and Tom Geismar. BCG designed for print initially, producing experiments in typographical design as well as taking on commercial projects. Amongst the experimental work was the booklet, Watching Words Move, in which words were redesigned to suggest their meaning in graphical as well as literal terms, e.g. \\"+dd\\", \\"-tract\\" and \\"sexxx\\". In 1958 BCG won the commission to design the United States' stand at the Brussels World's Fair. BCG also counted the Pepsi-Cola Company amongst its largest clients at this time. In addition to designing the company magazine, it also created the widely hailed Christmas decorations for Pepsi's New York headquarters. During this period, he also taught advanced advertising design as an adjunct professor at Pratt and Cooper Union. The end of 1959 saw the end of BCG. Brownjohn's drug use had escalated and he moved to London with his family in order, he hoped, to take advantage of the UK's more liberal attitude to drug use.Design Museum article on Brownjohn Following Brownjohn's departure, the company (known as Chermayeff & Geismar & Haviv today) became known for its seminal corporate identity programs.  London career  As one of the most f√™ted and socially connected designers from New York, Brownjohn fitted into the Swinging London scene effortlessly. He initially worked at the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency before leaving the firm to join McCann Erickson in 1962. It was in this year that Donna left Brownjohn, taking daughter Eliza, and moved to Ibiza. Brownjohn's career began to shift to working primarily with moving images. In 1963, the producers of the James Bond films approached Brownjohn after disagreements with film title designer Maurice Binder.Starlog magazine Maurice Binder interview Part 1 Harry Saltzman asked Brownjohn to design the title sequence for the second James Bond film, From Russia with Love.p.66-67 King, Emily, Brownjohn, Eliza & Brownjohn, Robert Robert Brownjohn:Sex and Typography 1970 Laurence King Publishing  Movie title sequences  Robert Brownjohn's work on two James Bond title sequences, From Russia with Love and Goldfinger, is probably his most widely known achievement. In these he used the technique of projecting moving footage onto the bodies of models and filming the results. The idea of filming projections is one gleaned from the Bauhaus and was used by L√°szl√≥ Maholy-Nagy in his early constructivist films of the 1920s. The combination of this artistic technique with the style and glamour of the 1960s typify Brownjohn's work. The use of wit and risqu√© humour, for example the deliberate lining up of a projected shot of a golf putt so that the ball appears to roll down gold painted model Margaret Nolan's cleavage, are also classic Brownjohn devices. Goldfinger's title design, photographed by David Watkin cost ¬£5000. Brownjohn also designed the British posters for the film featuring Sean Connery and Honor Blackman over a gold painted Margaret Nolan. A second poster, featuring the characters in a golden hand, was designed for Ireland.p.33 Nourmand, Tony James Bond Movie Posters: The Official 007 Collection 2004 Chronicle Books Eventually Saltzman and Brownjohn fell out, and Brownjohn worked on no other Bond films.pp68-69 Robert Brownjohn In all, Robert Brownjohn designed four title sequences: *From Russia with Love (1963) *Goldfinger (1964) *Where the Spies Are (1965) *The Night of the Generals (1967)  Later career and death  The most notable work from Brownjohn's post-Bond career is probably the cover for the 1969 Rolling Stones album Let It Bleed. He also created moving graphics for Midland Bank and Pirelli between 1966 and 1970. His final piece of graphic design was a poster for the New York Peace Campaign in 1969: an ace of spades playing card is laid on a plain white background with the letters \\"PE\\" hastily scribbled to the left of it and a question mark to the right. Brownjohn also had a small role as a fur coat-clad heavy in Dick Clement's film Otley. Robert Brownjohn died from a heart attack in London on August 1, 1970, seven days shy of his 45th birthday.

Castle and his wife in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His father was a professor of zoology at Harvard, a pioneer in mammalian genetics, and a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. The young Castle was educated in local schools and entered Harvard College in 1914. At the end of his third year of college, he enrolled in Harvard Medical School. Upon graduating from medical school, he did a medical internship at the Massachusetts General Hospital from 1921-1923. At the Mass General, he had his first direct exposure to some of the great clinicians of the time, including Chester M. Jones, with whom he collaborated on his first medical publication, and George R. Minot, who later became Castle's mentor and unflagging supporter. (Minot later shared the Nobel Prize.) In 1923 Castle accepted a position in the laboratory of Cecil Drinker at the Harvard School of Public Health. In 1925 Castle went back into a clinical setting at the Thorndike Memorial Laboratory on the Harvard service at the Boston City Hospital. He remained on the faculty of Harvard Medical School for his entire career. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1931. In 1939, Castle was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. The two Castles became the first father-and-son members in the history of that prestigious body. Marriage and family William B. Castle married Louise Muller in 1933. They had a daughter Anne and a son William. Work William B. Castle discovered gastric intrinsic factor, the absence of which causes pernicious anemia. Intrinsic factor was necessary to facilitate the absorption of an 'extrinsic factor' from the diet. Whipple, Minot and Murphy were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine, in 1934, for the discovery of the \\"anti-pernicious an√¶mia factor\\" from their experiments with liver in the diet. The 'extrinsic factor' is now known as vitamin B12 (cobalamin) and provides an effective therapy for pernicious anemia. In 1931 Castle went to Puerto Rico sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation International Health Board in a public health project. He conducted a several-month study for the Rockefeller Anemia Commission, as part of the Rockefeller Foundation's work in trying to combat hookworm in the Caribbean. Anemia was widespread on the island because of the endemic parasite hookworm and tropical sprue, the latter a disease which scientists thought possibly related to diet. Castle was assisted by Cornelius P. Rhoads, known as Dusty, who was affiliated with the Rockefeller Institute in New York and later became head of Memorial Hospital for Cancer Care and Research. They showed that tropical sprue was caused by intestinal impermeability to this and other hematopoietic factors in food. They were able to use liver extract therapy to treat tropical sprue successfully. It is still a problem in Puerto Rico, but it can be treated with folic acid and a 3-6 month course of antibiotics. In closely related studies, Castle defined the need for iron for the bone marrow to make hemoglobin. Without adequate iron in the diet, children and adults develop iron deficiency anemia, a common scourge. Castle and his team later characterized the red blood cell defects that are responsible for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and hereditary spherocytosis. They also did important research on sickle cell disease. It is a genetic disease found at high frequency among people of African ethnicity. Teaching Aside from his work in research, Castle was a highly influential teacher. He had \\"three generations of trainees\\"‚Äîhis intellectual children, grandchildren and great- grandchildren‚Äîwho put his stamp of excellence upon the field of hematology. A train ride In 1945 Castle and the biochemist Linus Pauling traveled together by overnight train from Denver to Chicago. On the train Castle told Pauling about some of the work he had been doing on sickle cell disease and mentioned that when red cells sickled, they changed shape and showed birefringence in polarized light. Castle believed that some kind of molecular alignment or orientation must be occurring. Castle suggested that this might be \\"the kind of thing\\" in which Pauling might be interested. It was. The following year, Pauling and his colleagues at Caltech began the studies that eventually showed that the hemoglobin in sickle cell disease was abnormal. This discovery of what Pauling came to call a \\"molecular disease\\" was revolutionary.  References  Sources *Biographical Memoir of William B. Castle by James H.

Early years  Born September 7, 1953 in Jacksonville, North Carolina, he attended Richlands High School and Chowan Junior College (in Murfreesboro, North Carolina). He played his university football at Edinboro University in Edinboro, Pennsylvania. Playing in the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference in 1975 and 1976, Green was named Honorable Mention All-American by the Associated Press and to the Conference all star team. In 19 games he had a career average 104 rushing yards per game at Edinboro. He was inducted into the Edinboro Hall of Fame on April 30, 1988.  Professional career  Green played with the Montreal Alouettes of the CFL for three seasons. He played 5 games in 1978, 16 games in 1979 and 14 games in 1980. He also played in two Grey Cup games: the 66th Grey Cup and 67th Grey Cup. His best year was 1979, when he rushed 287 times for 1,678 yards and he had nine 100 yard plus rushing games. His best day came on October 27, 1979, against the Ottawa Rough Riders, when he rushed 29 times for 212 yards. He also scored 3 touchdowns against the Toronto Argonauts on October 22, 1979. He was the CFL's Most Outstanding Player Award and an All Canadian all star that season. He was an All East division all star in 1980. His best Grey Cup game was the 67th Grey Cup against the Edmonton Eskimos, when he led all players with 142 rushing yards (the third highest single game total) in a close loss. He won the Grey Cup Most Valuable Player award for this performance. Following his all-star performance, he publicly announced his intention to bargain for a better Alouettes contract for the 1980 CFL season as his contract stated if he won the 1979 Most Outstanding Player Award, he could re-negotiate. In his dealings, he made public comments about seeking a million dollars, sought a trade with the Toronto Argonauts, and, in June 1980, even filed retirement papers to force the Alouettes hand, who stated Green would have to honour the original contract if a mutual agreement could not be reached. Finally, a deal was signed prior to the first regular season game. Prior to the 1981 CFL season, new Alouettes owner Nelson Skalbania traded Green and Keith Baker to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in exchange for the negotiating rights to Vince Ferragamo, which they held. Green was benched for the fourth quarter of a July game against the Calgary Stampeders after he insisted on taping up an injured ankle despite new head coach Frank Kush's outlawing of the practice of taping ankles and shoes. In 1982, Green played for the Cleveland Browns of the NFL, during the strike shortened season, returning a single kickoff for 13 yards.

The Chairs () is an absurdist \\"tragic farce\\" play by Eug√®ne Ionesco. It was written in 1952 and debuted the same year. Plot The play concerns two characters, known as Old Man and Old Woman, frantically preparing chairs for a series of invisible guests who are coming to hear an orator reveal the Old Man's discovery. It is implied that this discovery is the meaning of life, but it is never actually said. The guests supposedly include \\"everyone\\", implying everyone in the world; there are other implications that this is a post-apocalyptic world. The Old Man, for example, speaks of the destruction of Paris. The invisibility of the guests implies that the Old Man and Old Woman are the last two people on the planet. As the \\"guests\\" arrive, the two characters speak to them and reminisce cryptically about their lives. A high point in the happiness of the couple is reached when the invisible emperor arrives. Finally, the orator arrives to deliver his speech to the assembled crowd. Played by a real actor, the orator's physical presence contradicts the expectations set up by the action earlier in the play. The old couple then commit suicide by throwing themselves out of the window into the ocean. They claim that life couldn't get any better at this point because the whole world is about to hear the Old Man's astounding revelation. As the orator begins to speak, the invisible crowd assembled in the room and the real audience in the theatre discover that the orator is a deaf-mute. At the end of the play, the sound of an audience fades in. Ionesco claimed that this sound was the most significant moment in the play, writing in a letter to the first director, \\"The last decisive moment of the play should be the expression of ... absence,\\" He said that after the Orator leaves, > At this moment the audience would have in front of them ‚Ä¶ empty chairs on an > empty stage decorated with streamers, littered with useless confetti, which > would give an impression of sadness, emptiness and disenchantment such as > one finds in a ballroom after a dance; and it would be after this that the > chairs, the scenery, the void, would inexplicably come to life (that is the > effect, an effect beyond reason, true in its improbability, that we are > looking for and that we must obtain), upsetting logic and raising fresh > doubts. Productions The play was first produced on 22 April 1952 at the Th√©√¢tre Lancry under the direction of Sylvain Dhomme.

It was the most significant slave rebellion in the Caribbean between the 1733 slave insurrection on St. John and the 1791 Haitian Revolution. According to Professor Trevor Burnard: \\"In terms of its shock to the imperial system, only the American Revolution surpassed Tacky's War in the eighteenth century.\\" It was the most dangerous slave rebellion in the British Empire until the Baptist War of Samuel Sharpe in 1831‚Äì32, which also occurred in the Colony of Jamaica.Craton, Michael. Testing the Chains. Cornell University Press, 1982, p. 138.  Planning  The leader of the rebellion, Tacky (Akan spelling: Takyi), was originally from the Fante ethnic group in West Africa and had been a paramount chief in Fante land (in the Central region of present-day Ghana) before being enslaved. He and his lieutenants planned to take over Jamaica from the British, and to create a separate black country. The uprising was inspired by the successful resistance of the Asante Queen Nanny and the Jamaican Maroons during the First Maroon War of the 1730s. Before being a slave, he was a king of his village. He himself recalled selling his rivals of the Ashanti, Nzema and Ahanta, off into slavery as spoils of war to the British. But ironically, he would become a slave himself when a rival state defeated his army in battle and sold him into slavery, and he ended up in Jamaica. According to J.A. Jones, who claimed to have met him while being held captive by Tacky while trying to get an interview with him, in his memoirs he wrote that Tacky spoke very fluent English (which was indeed common for the ruling class of Fantes at the time).Jones, James Athearn (1831), Haverill, or memoirs of an officer in the army of Wolfe (J.J & Harper), p. 199. Also according to Jones, he was discovered in a cave a year before the rebellion took place, planning with his comrades: Quaw (twi Yaw), Sang, Sobadou(twi Sobadu), Fula Jati and Quantee(twi Kwarteng). All except Fula Jati being of Akan descent. The slave revolt was a coordinated island-wide conspiracy, led by a secret network of Akan (Coromantee) slaves.Richard Dunn, A Tale of Two Plantations: Slave Life and Labor in Jamaica and Virginia (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2014), p. 333.  Rebellion  Sometime before daybreak on Easter Monday, 7 April 1760, Tacky and his followers began the revolt and easily took over the Frontier and Trinity plantations while killing their masters. Bolstered by their easy success, they made their way to the storeroom at Fort Haldane where the munitions to defend the town of Port Maria were kept. After killing the storekeeper, Tacky and his men stole nearly 4 barrels of gunpowder and 40 firearms with shot, before marching on to overrun the plantations at Heywood Hall and Esher.Craton, Michael. Testing the Chains. Cornell University Press, 1982, pp. 129‚Äì30. By dawn, hundreds of other slaves had joined Tacky and his followers. At Ballard's Valley, the rebels stopped to rejoice in their success. One slave from Esher decided to slip away and sound the alarm. Obeahmen (Caribbean witch doctors) quickly circulated around the camp dispensing a powder that they claimed would protect the men from injury in battle and loudly proclaimed that an Obeahman could not be killed. Confidence was high. Soon there were 70 to 80 mounted militia on their way along with some Maroons from Moore Town, Charles Town, Jamaica and Scott's Hall (Jamaica), who were bound by treaty to suppress such rebellions. The Maroon contingents were commanded by Moore Town's white superintendent Charles Swigle, and the Maroon officers reporting to him were Clash and Sambo from Moore Town, Quaco and Cain from Charles Town, and Cudjo and Davy the Maroon from Scott's Hall.Michael Siva, After the Treaties: A Social, Economic and Demographic History of Maroon Society in Jamaica, 1739‚Äì1842, PhD Dissertation (Southampton: Southampton University, 2018), pp. 71‚Äì73, 93‚Äì99. When the militia learned of the Obeahman's boast of not being able to be killed, an Obeahman was captured, killed and hung with his mask, ornaments of teeth and bone and feather trimmings at a prominent place visible from the encampment of rebels. Many of the rebels, confidence shaken, returned to their plantations. Tacky and 25 or so men decided to fight on. Tacky and his men went running through the woods being chased by the Maroons and their legendary marksman, Davy. While running at full speed, Davy shot Tacky and cut off his head as evidence of his feat, for which he would be richly rewarded. Tacky's head was later displayed on a pole in Spanish Town until a follower took it down in the middle of the night. The rest of Tacky's men were found in a cave near Tacky Falls, having committed suicide rather than going back to slavery.Craton, Michael. Testing the Chains. Cornell University Press, 1982, pp. 136‚Äì37.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 98‚Äì99.  Akua, \\"Queen of Kingston\\"  In June 1760, similar plots had been discovered in Manchester Parish, and the now-defunct parishes of St John, St Dorothy and St Thomas-ye-Vale. It was also discovered that slaves in Kingston had elected a female Ashanti slave named Cubah (a British misnomer of the Akan day name \\"Akua\\") the rank of 'Queen of Kingston'. Cubah (Akua) sat in state under a canopy at their meetings, wearing a robe and a crown.Craton, Michael. Testing the Chains. Cornell University Press, 1982, p. 132 It is unknown whether there was any direct communication between Cubah's people and Tacky's but when discovered, she was ordered to be transported from the island for conspiracy to rebel.Craton, Michael. Testing the Chains, p. 360 Whilst at sea, she bribed the captain of the ship to put her ashore in western Jamaica where she joined the leeward rebels and remained at large for months. On being recaptured, she was executed.  Western Revolt  The rebellion didn't end there, as other rebellions broke out all over Jamaica, many of which were rightly or wrongly attributed to Tacky's cunning and strategy. Other slaves learned of Tacky's revolt, which inspired unrest and disorder throughout the island. Rebels numbering about 1,200 regrouped in the unsettled mountainous forests in western Jamaica. They attacked eight slave plantations in Westmoreland Parish and two in Hanover Parish, killing a number of whites.Dunn, A Tale of Two Plantations, pp. 333‚Äì34. Refugees, both white and black, fled the Westmoreland capital of Savanna-la-Mar and on May 29, an attempt by the Westmoreland militia to storm the rebels' barricaded encampment was soundly defeated and repelled. On June 2, however, bolstered by militias from two more western parishes, a detachment of British soldiers and sailors, and the skilled Maroon warriors of Accompong Town, the colonial forces successfully stormed the barricade and drove the slave rebels out following a two-hour battle, killing and capturing scores of rebels.Dunn, A Tale of Two Plantations, p. 334. On June 10, on the outskirts of the estate of Mesopotamia, owned by Joseph Foster Barham I, a detachment of soldiers and militia defeated a band of rebel slaves, killing about 40 and capturing another 50.Dunn, A Tale of Two Plantations, pp. 334‚Äì36. The rebel slaves continued fighting for the rest of the year in western Jamaica, forcing the governor, Sir Henry Moore, 1st Baronet, to continue imposing martial law in Westmoreland and surrounding areas.Craton, Michael. Testing the Chains. Cornell University Press, 1982, pp. 137‚Äì38. By late 1761, Governor Moore declared that the main western revolt was over. However, some remaining rebels then scattered in small bands, and operating from the forested interior of the Cockpit Country, they conducted a campaign of guerrilla warfare for the rest of the decade, staging raids on plantations within their reach.Dunn, A Tale of Two Plantations, pp. 334‚Äì37.Craton, Michael. Testing the Chains. Cornell University Press, 1982, pp. 138‚Äì39. In 1766, another rebellion took place in Westmoreland, also inspired by Tacky's Revolt. About 33 Akan slaves rose up in revolt, and killed 19 whites, before it was brutally suppressed.Craton, Michael. Testing the Chains. Cornell University Press, 1982, p. 140. Most of the remaining rebels then moved to the south-western Saint Elizabeth Parish, where they operated out of the mountainous forests of Nassau Mountain.Dunn, A Tale of Two Plantations, pp. 334‚Äì36.  Aftermath  It took months and even years for order to be restored, depending on which parish the rebels operated from. Over 60 white people had lost their lives, as well as a similar number of free people of colour, in addition to 400 or so black slaves, including two ringleaders who were burned alive, and two others who were hung in iron cages at the Kingston Parade, until they starved to death. More than 500 rebel slaves were \\"transported\\", or re-sold as slaves to new owners in the British colony in the Bay of Honduras. It is estimated that the destruction caused by Tacky's Revolt, and other spin-off rebellions, cost the Colony of Jamaica over ¬£100,000, which is many millions in today's currency.Craton, Michael. Testing the Chains. Cornell University Press, 1982, pp. 136‚Äì39. The colonial Assembly passed a number of draconian laws to regulate the slaves in the aftermath of Tacky's Revolt. In addition, they banned the West African religious practices of obeah.Craton, Michael. Testing the Chains. Cornell University Press, 1982, p. 139. Tacky Monument in Claude Stuart Park can be visited in Port Maria, St Mary. Tacky Falls is accessible by the sea but the overland route is considered by locals to be too tough to travel. The waterfalls have diminished over the years and mainly eroded rocks mark the course. The exact location of the cave where the remains of Tacky's men were found is not known. Tacky's Rebellion was, like many other Atlantic slave revolts, put down quickly and mercilessly by colonial officials. Planters severely punished rebel slaves.

Clower, is an idea used in economic theory to capture monetary phenomena. In the most basic economic models (such as the Walras model or the Arrow‚ÄìDebreu model) there is no role for money, as these models are not sufficiently detailed to consider how people pay for goods, other than to say everyone has a budget constraint. To be able to say anything about the money supply, inflation, monetary policy and so on, economists must therefore introduce additional assumptions into their models. One possibility, and the more popular one, is to introduce a cash-in-advance constraint i.e. a requirement that each consumer or firm must have sufficient cash available before they can buy goods. An alternative assumption would be a 'Money-in-the- Utility-Function' assumption pioneered by Miguel Sidrauski, which states that people have a tendency to hold a certain amount of cash because they derive utility from holding it. Without these (or similar) assumptions economic theory would find it difficult to explain why people carry around a good (money) which takes up space in their wallet, can't be consumed and does not earn any interest. Terms Cash in advance is a term describing terms of purchase, when full payment for a good or service is due before the merchandise is shipped. This presents the least risk to a seller while having the most risk to the buyer. It is often combined with other terms such as Free On Board, which require the buyer to take possession of the merchandise as soon as it is loaded onto transportation, meaning the buyer assumes the financial risk if the shipment is lost or damaged en route. In actual daily business these sort of terms are extremely rare unless the goods or services are of phenomenal value and high fragility. A constraint is any operating condition that puts a limit on the ability of a business to conduct its operations. Examples A company with $5000 on hand and incomes of $3000 a month has a constraint of $8000. That means, if the terms of an economic exchange (buying equipment, etc.) require terms that are cash-in-advance, then the limit that the company can actually obtain is $8000. Uses It is mostly used in a theoretical sense, to provide proofs of economic efficiencies, since it does not (by definition) involve terms of credit or financing. In these modeling theories, CIAC tends to show that up-front restrictions artificially limit the ability of companies to maintain positive inventory levels while reducing capital investment. They also inhibit real wealth in terms of cash on hand while elevating the likelihood of using junk bonds as instruments of solvency, a dangerous premise.

Spain's southeast coast, where the park is situated, is the only region in mainland Europe with a true hot desert climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: BWh). The eponymous mountain range of the Sierra del Cabo de Gata, with its highest peak El Fraile, form Spain's largest volcanic rock formation with sharp peaks and crags in red and ochre hues. It falls steeply to the Mediterranean Sea, creating jagged high cliffs riven by gullies, creating hidden coves and white, sandy beaches. Offshore are numerous tiny rocky islands and extensive coral reefs teeming with marine life. Its climate is the driest in Europe, with rainfall below a year and average yearly temperatures above . In 1997 it was designated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. In 2001 it was included among the Specially Protected Areas of Mediterranean Importance. Due to the adsorptive properties and low permeability of its clays, the area was studied as a possible place for deep storage of sealed radioactive waste. The name Cabo de Gata could be derived from the agate rock formerly mined in the area. Geology, geography, climate, and vegetation  Volcanic rock-formations at Playa de M√≥nsul, possibly the most popular beach Las Salinas de Cabo de Gata The pueblo of San Jos√© Playa de los Genoveses is the second most popular beach and within walking distance of the pueblo of San Jos√© Semana Santa in N√≠jar- although processions may look sinister, they are quite moving and far removed from practices often associated with such clothing; note the ceramics for which N√≠jar is known Playa el Playazo One of the more popular beaches near to the pueblo of Rodalquilar Playa de San Miguel The church shown here has a curious history and the old abandoned fishing boats are left as a type of \\"living museum\\" Cabo de Gata-N√≠jar Natural Park is characterised by volcanic rock formations - lava flows, volcanic domes, volcanic calderas. The park joined UNESCO's Global Geoparks Network in 2006, and is also a member of the European Geoparks Network. European geoparks website Between the village of San Miguel and the Cabo de Gata point are salt flats (Las Salinas de Cabo de Gata) separated from the sea by a sand bar. The salt flats are a Ramsar site. Its coasts have seagrass beds of the genus Posidonia and offshore coral reefs, both dramatically increasing the numbers of resident and transient marine species. A part of the total designated protected area is a marine reserve, extending underwater to a depth of . The area has a Hot desert climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: BWh) with rather mild temperatures year round for the heavy maritime influence. The annual average temperature is about , and the average annual rainfall is of , recorded at the Faro del Cabo de Gata (36¬∞43'18.8 N, 2¬∞11'34.69\\" W) during the period 1961‚Äì1990, making this area the driest place in Europe.Capel Molina, J.J. (1995) Mapa pluviom√©trico de Espa√±a Peninsular y Baleares (en el periodo internacional 1961-1990) Investigaciones Geogr√°ficas n¬∫ 13: 29-466ISSN 0213-4691 pdf Idioma: espa√±ol. Acceso: 3/7/2009. The characteristic vegetation in the terrestrial zone is drought-adapted flora: largely agave, prickly pear, dwarf fan palms, and a number of xerophytes (some of which are endemic). There is Posidonia seagrass in the marine zone. Human impact on the park The unfinished Algarrobico hotel, which has been in the park since 2003 Historically, due to the harsh conditions for agriculture and its isolated location, habitation has been sparse and this has kept the area relatively unspoilt, an unusual feature along the Spanish Mediterranean coast. 3,500 people were recorded as living within the boundaries in 1997. The natural park protection it now receives promises to keep residential expansion under control. Dotted around the natural park are abandoned farms, houses, factories, and sometimes, whole villages dating back to various periods in time. The exact reasons for the abandonment are not clear, but it is thought that the harsh conditions for agriculture together with questionable permissions to build and the prevailing economic climate at the time, would be major factors. Sadly, this is something that continues to this day with perhaps the most infamous example being the Algarrobico. In 2003 a hotel project was started at Playa del Algarrobico between Carboneras and Mojacar, just inside the park. Work on the project was halted, but demolition, which is opposed by 14 municipalities, has yet to be carried out. Several reputable sources claim with good evidence, that this project is an illegal development although it seems that more recently demolition plans are moving closer. There are also a number of abandoned villages and buildings that are considered to be of historical importance and so remain as they have been left. Good examples of this are the deserted mining villages around Rodalquilar. Although the villages or \\"ghost towns\\" and the former gold mines are a blot on the landscape, they are a big attraction and there have even been concerts hosted at the site of a former gold mine. Sadly there are also a number of national treasures that lie in ruins, and an example of this is Cortijo del Fraile. Every now and then there is a move to restore it, but as yet, nothing has happened except a few efforts to raise money. Tourism Tourism continues as one of the biggest industries in the Parque Natural de Cabo de Gata with huge numbers of visitors from all over the world coming mainly during the spring and summer months. In 1998 there were 500,000 tourists visiting the area and although the number of visitors has declined in the past year (2011/2012) due to economic conditions across Europe, tourism still remains strong. Over recent years there has been a trend toward Sustainable / Eco Tourism and visitors can enjoy environmentally- friendly outdoor activities such as bird watching, photography experiences, geological field-trips, as well as the more established diving and boat excursions. There are a number of arts and crafts based on local traditions that are still carried out around the Parque Natural de Cabo de Gata and especially so in the little Moorish \\"pueblo blanco\\" of N√≠jar. The traditional arts and crafts include ceramics, pottery, carpet making and woven goods (baskets, hats, shoes, etc.) made from esparto grass. The same arts and crafts are found in many different places around the natural park alongside painting, sculpture, and photography. Also one may find in several of the pueblos, craft market stalls selling hand-made (hecho de mano) jewellery, leather goods, clothing, and incense holders, in addition to local shops selling local produce such as olive oil, wine, almonds, tomatoes, and so on. There also has been an increase in the number of health retreats that offer holistic therapies, meditation, and yoga. While the hiking network is not extensive, there are a number of senderos that provide for some good day hikes. The Caldera de Majada Redonda is one such trail that leads to the center of an ancient volcano caldera. Towns  There are some small towns in the Cabo de Gata area. =Agua Amarga= Translated from the Spanish, Agua Amarga literally means, bitter water. This name dates back to when trains used to bring minerals from the mines in the Sierra Alhamilla and chemicals used in the mining process would taint the wells in the town. These days Agua Amarga is one of the hot-spots for visitors to the Parque Natural de Cabo de Gata. It is a seaside town. This small village is surrounded by many small beaches with cristaline water and great submarine life, perfect for snorkelling. =Cabo de Gata= The strip of beach known as Playa de San Miguel and the adjacent road stretches from the small village of Cabo de Gata to La Fabriquilla before ascending a tiny mountain pass toward the Arrecife de las Sirenas and the stunning beaches beyond. This coastal strip is generally known as Cabo de Gata although it comprises several little smaller villages (pueblitos) including Cabo de Gata, Almadraba de Monteleva, and La Fabriquila. There are a number of hotels and places to eat and drink along this beach. At Almadraba de Monteleva are the salt works that are still operational, next to the salt works are the ram shackled and salt-blasted houses of former workers, some of which are still occupied. Opposite these houses is the curious church of San Miguel. Behind the salt-works are the lagoons known as Las Salinas de Cabo de Gata, as previously mentioned. Cabo de Gata has tradition of fishing, which continues to this day, and there are a number of old fishing boats that have been left along the Playa de San Miguel as artifacts of days gone by. These are said to have an important ethnological value and so are left as a \\"living museum\\". =Carboneras= The pueblo of Carboneras is located near to the easternmost border of Parque Natural de Cabo de Gata and is a fairly large town. Carboneras has a convivial atmosphere and night-life almost throughout the year as it is a major seaside town. The main town has fine beaches. Located just a little out-of-town and en route to Agua Amarga, is the popular naturist beach of Playa de los Muertos (the Beach of the Dead), which is reported to have been voted one of the country's top beaches. Carboneras is also known as a town of live music due to the Teatro de Musica and a number of other smaller venues hosting live music all year round. At its western edge it has an industrial area that combines a power station, a large cement works, one of Europe's largest desalination (reverse-osmosis) plants and a port, all of which pre-date the setting up the national park. The power station has been used for carbon capture research. Whilst the desalination plant, provides water to the local communities, as well as the burgeoning green house based vegetable industry. =Las Negras= Las Negras is a little different from the other pueblos in Parque Natural de Cabo de Gata. It is a peaceful yet lively little sea-side village towards the eastern end of the natural park and just to the west of Agua Amarga. Las Negras has some rather odd buildings that are very 1970s in appearance because it has been developed in a more modern style to other towns. Despite its size, there is a lively night-life and some great places to eat and drink and enjoy live music. Las Negras is a bit of a haven for the more bohemian type of person and has a lovely beach on which to sit and watch the world go by. From Las Negras there is a footpath to Cala de San Pedro, which takes about 40 minutes to an hour to walk or one may take a boat. =Los Albaricoques= Any movie buff will recognise Los Albaricoques as being the pueblo of Agua Caliente in the seminal films of Sergio Leone. The final shoot out in the film For a few dollars more took place in the centre of Los Albaricoques. The economy of Los Albaricoques relies heavily on the agriculture that surrounds the village and arguably, some of the best tomatoes from Spain are grown in this area, notably the 'Raff'. There is only one shop and two bars in Los Albaricoques. One of these bars Hostal Alba, is a mecca for film / movie buffs and a tribute to the village's cinematic history. Not far from the pueblo of Los Albaricoques is the infamous Cortijo del Fraile, the backdrop for Federico Garcia Lorca's seminal play, Bodas de Sangre (Blood Wedding), which features a crime of passion that took place close by. =N√≠jar= N√≠jar is located inland and on the northern edge of the natural park. The visit is made all the more pleasant thanks to the many reasonably priced bars and restaurants offering delicious local dishes. There are also hostels and hotels in and around N√≠jar. N√≠jar hosts processions on Semana Santa (Holy Week). In the bigger towns and cities around Spain, these processions are quite lavish including at times some very intricate animatronics but in smaller towns, such as in N√≠jar, they are much more \\"earthy\\" affairs. =Rodalquilar= The tranquil town (pueblo) of Rodalquilar sits peacefully in the middle of the Parque Natural de Cabo de Gata and is a haven for the local artistic community. There are a number of unique independent galleries dedicated to showing off painting, photography, pottery, and ceramics. Rodalaquilar is a sleepy town with some very nice places to eat and stunning beaches and could not be more different from its past, for it is known in the province of Almer√≠a for ancient mines of gold. A trip to the natural park is not complete without a visit to the goldmines and abandoned miner villages. One of the more popular \\"must see\\" beaches near Rodalquilar is Playa el Playazo. In common with many of the beaches in the middle and toward the western end of the natural park, the sea is normally crystal clear and perfect for snorkelling or diving. =San Jos√©= San Jos√© is a small fishing port in the centre of the natural park. Over recent years it is seeing an increase in the number of visitors and is an easily accessible town from Almer√≠a airport and the A7 autovia. San Jos√© is most popular during the spring and summer months. There are several restaurants and tapas bars in San Jos√©. The local independently run tourist office is used as a reference point for activities in the Parque Natural de Cabo de Gata. =Various other= There are a number of smaller towns and villages in the Parque Natural de Cabo de Gata that are worth mentioning and each with its own charm and historical or ethnological importance. Campohermoso, Fern√°n P√©rez, Isleta del Moro, Los Escullos, Pozo de los Frailes, and San Isidro are just some of them. Isleta del Moro and Los Escullos are particularly interesting as they are along the coast and have some stunning, if not smaller beaches. There is a network of footpaths (senderos) that connect all the seaside towns and pueblos. Flora The European fan palm (Chamaerops humilis) is used as the symbol of the park The Agave (Pita) another symbol of the natural park, if not the whole of the province of Almer√≠a There are more than 1,000 plants recorded in the reserve, some of which are endemic to the Parque Natural de Cabo de Gata and some of which have become symbols of the natural park. =European fan palm= The European fan palm (Chamaerops humilis) is a shrub-like clumping palm, with several stems growing from a single base. It is the only palm species native to continental Europe and is mainly found in southwestern Europe (Spain, Portugal, Italy, Malta and certain locations on the Mediterranean coast of France) and northwest Africa (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia). Europe's only native palm, supplements the meagre groundwater supplies with dew and airborne moisture. =Agave (Pita) Americana= One of the most familiar plant species in the natural park is Agave (Pita) Americana, a native of tropical America and Mexico. Common names include century plant, maguey (in Mexico), or American aloe (it is not, however, closely related to the genus Aloe). The name \\"century plant\\" refers to the long time the plant takes to flower. The number of years before flowering occurs depends on the vigor of the individual plant, the richness of the soil, and the climate; during these years the plant is storing in its fleshy leaves the nourishment required for the effort of flowering. =Dragoncillo del Cabo= Some of the plants endemic to the Parque Natural de Cabo de Gata include the pink snapdragon (Antirrhinum charidemi), known to the locals as the Dragoncillo del Cabo. =Other plants= Iberia's largest population of jujube (Ziziphus zizyphus), a thorny shrub, populates the steppe and is known locally as Azofeifa. The scrubland is composed of olive trees (Olea europaea), mastic (Pistacia lentiscus), Kermes oaks (Quercus coccifera), esparto grass (Stipa tenacissima), thyme (Thymus) and rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis). Around the salt flats are colonies of saltworts, common reeds (Phragmites australis) and the glasswort (Salicornia fruticosa). In the coastal waters are extensive beds of seagrass (Posidonia oceanica), which is endemic to the Mediterranean, and 260 species of seaweed. Fauna Thousands of greater flamingos can be seen on the salt flats near the headland Flying gurnard (Dactylopterus volitans) 1,100 species of fauna have been recorded within the park, the majority of which are birds. The European Union has designated a Special Protection Area for bird-life. The salt flats provide an important habitat for both the resident birds and the thousands of migrating birds who stop on their journey between Europe and Africa. Species found around the salt flats include flamingos (Phoenicopterus roseus); grey (Ardea cinerea); purple herons (Ardea purpurea); storks; cranes; waders including avocets and oystercatchers; and overwintering ducks. Many species of lark live on the steppe, including the rare Dupont's lark (Chersophilus duponti) and there are also little bustards (Tetrax tetrax) and stone curlews (Burhinus oedicnemus). Sea birds include yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis), terns, razorbills (Alca torda), shags, the occasional puffin (Fratercula arctica) and Cory's (Calonectris diomedea) and Balearic shearwaters (Puffinus mauretanicus). The wealth of animal life provides prey for a number of raptors: ospreys (Pandion haliaetus), peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus), kestrels (Falco tinnunculus), and eagles. Approximately 15 species of reptile are found in the park, including Italian wall lizards (Podarcis sicula), ocellated lizards (Timon lepidus), grass snakes (Natrix natrix), and Lataste's viper (Vipera latastei). The maritime reserve is home to various species of crustaceans, molluscs, and fishes including the common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), the Pinna nobilis clam that produces sea silk, the Mediterranean moray (Muraena helena) that was regarded as a delicacy by the Romans, the garfish (Belone belone), and flying gurnard (Dactylopterus volitans), which uses its enlarged pectoral fins to \\"walk\\" along the ocean floor. Seaweeds host fish such as bream and grouper. Among the mammals in the park are common genets (Genetta genetta), wild boar (Sus scrofa), the garden dormouse (Eliomys quercinus), and the least weasel (Mustela nivalis), the smallest terrestrial mammalian carnivore. The seagrass used to provide a habitat for the endangered monk seal (Monachus monachus). Up until the 1960s it was one of the last locations where this seal bred in Spain, the islet of Tabarca being the other. Although occasionally sighted offshore, no seals have bred in the park since 1965. Media British band Jamiroquai filmed the video for their 1996/1997 single Cosmic Girl in the park.

Since 1989, Hammond has exhibited internationally in Spain, Sweden, Italy, and the Netherlands. In 1989, Hammond was invited by Bill Goldston to print at ULAE. After experimenting with monoprints, she turned to a combination of lithography, silkscreen, intaglio, and collage to achieve the complex layering of her trademark images. In 1993, the Cincinnati Art Museum organized her first museum exhibition.Galerie Lelong In June 1993, Hammond asked Ashbery to recommend titles for future paintings. A week later he faxed her 44 titles. By December 1994, she had employed 13 of the titles, \\"reusing one four times and another twice.\\" In 1994, several of their collaborative paintings were exhibited at Jose Freire Fine Art, New York City, New York; The Freedman Gallery, Albright College, Reading, Pennsylvania and the Orlando Museum of Art, Orlando, Florida. Contemporary work In 2003, Hammond became the first woman to create the poster for the French Open tennis tournament; her poster became the cover of Tennis Week magazine. Primarily a painter, Hammond also works with photographs and makes prints. She made prints at Universal Limited Art Editions and at Shark's Ink. She is represented by the Galerie Lelong in New York and the Greg Kucera Gallery in Seattle. According to a 2002 article in the New York Times, ‚ÄúMs. Hammond [aims] to make paintings 'as complicated, inconsistent, varied, multifaceted as you are, as I am, as life is.... I think my work deals very directly with the time that we live in,' Ms. Hammond said. 'There's a surfeit of information, increasingly bodiless because of the computer, and I bring to this an interest in how meaning is constructed'.... The best metaphor for the method behind her rollicking, erudite, street-smart, angst-ridden, encyclopedic paintings is writing.\\"New York Times, October 13, 2002, section 2, p. 35 The Times spoke of Hammond's \\"predilection for systems. For decades it has been her practice to limit all her paintings to mix-and-match selections from a total of 276 found images.\\" Since this article was written, Hammond has moved in new directions; she no longer limits her painting to a body of found images. Masindi - detail Many of her works are based on dreams, such as a recent series of works in which butterflies are laid over maps of various countries. She explains her approach to painting thus: > Painting is a cross between high philosophy and cement work. My biggest way > of relating to this concept of time and labor is that it is an entry point > for reaching the unconscious. The layers of paint have more to do with > duration than texture. I see it as a function of time, like the idea of > chanting. Certain things can begin to happen because you're with the > painting for long periods of time.

The sculpture was accompanied by a wall text which read, \\"Each unique handmade leaf is inscribed by the artist with the name of a U.S. soldier killed in Iraq. The exhibition begins with 1511 leaves.\\" The work was acquired and exhibited by the Whitney Museum of American Art in 2006 and subsequently shown at the Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum, St. Louis, MO, the Wexner Center for the Arts, Columbus, OH and the Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, CA. The artist has continued to update this memorial piece. The most recent exhibition opened with 4229 leaves. ‚ÄúJane Hammond: Paper Work‚Äù an exhibition which contained all manner of works on paper from 1989 through 2006 recently traveled with presentations at the Tucson Museum of Art; the Chazen Museum of Art, Madison, WI (formerly the Elvehjem Museum); the Arkansas Arts Center, Little Rock, AR; the Herbert F. Johnson Museum, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY; the Achenbach Foundation at the DeYoung Museum, San Francisco, CA and the Detroit Institute of Art, Detroit, MI. The show was accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue published by Penn State Press and the Mt. Holyoke College Museum, containing essays by Faye Hirsch and Nancy Princenthal and an interview with the artist by Douglas Dreishspoon. The exhibition was organized and first presented by the Mt. Holyoke College Museum of Art (2006). On August 11, 2007, Hammond's painting \\"All Souls (Piedras Negras)\\" sold for $75,000 at an auction at the Anderson Ranch Arts Center in Aspen, Colorado. In 2015 Hammond spoke on a panel about drawing at the CAA conference with artists Hollis Hammonds, Richard Moninski and Elise Engler. She is a Governor for Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture where she was a resident in 1997 and faculty in 2005.

Leavitt graduated from the University of Chicago School of Medicine and is the husband of medical historian Judith Walzer Leavitt. As a clinician evaluating young children who have developmental disabilities, Leavitt has been active in efforts to translate research into clinical practice. He has worked extensively with parent groups for public education regarding developmental disability issues. At the Waisman Center, Leavitt directs an interdisciplinary training program for pre- and post-doctoral physicians, nurses and allied health professionals working in the field of developmental disabilities. Currently, his research efforts include studying coping mechanisms used by parents who have adolescents and adults with autism. His research for many years has focused on the development of communication between parents and their infants or young children. His work has used physiological measures, such as heart rate, skin conductance, and non-nutritive sucking, as well as behavioral observation. His early work investigated infant speech perception and the impact of prematurity on infant development. His current work investigates the role of maternal sensitivity to infant signals in the development of mother-infant communication and behavioral interaction. A primary focus of this work is the implication of early parent-child interaction in determining trajectories of child development for both typically and atypically developing children. Leavitt is an important figure in the research field of infant development and parent-infant interaction. He has written extensively on how parents can help their children understand trauma. Leavitt is the author of a booklet, \\"When Terrible Things Happen: A Parent's Guide to Talking with Their Children,\\" sponsored by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the International Pediatric Association and the Johnson and Johnson Pediatric Institute.

Examples were built in the United Kingdom, Soviet Union and Italy but the relatively high cost of fuel oil meant that the designs were not pursued. Kitson-Still system In 1926 Kitson and Company, Leeds, built an experimental example for the London and North Eastern Railway, using as their model the Still engine already in use for stationary and marine applications. It was on trial until 1934, but then scrapped. It was designed because a steam engine offered a high starting torque‚Äîa tractive force of was available‚Äîwhile a diesel engine offered a high fuel efficiency and it was considered desirable to combine the two. =Construction= In outline the machine resembled a conventional 2-6-2T steam locomotive, but it had four pairs of horizontally opposed cylinders (13¬Ω inch bore √ó 15¬Ω inch stroke‚Äî343 √ó 394 mm) mounted longitudinally above the frame and driving a crankshaft placed between them, with the further drivetrain by gears. The cylinders were made double-ended, with the rod end of each cylinder for steam and the closed end fitted with a diesel injector. (Some drawings, published in contemporary magazines, show only two pairs of cylinders and it seems that this was one of the design features that was changed during development.) The boiler, with a diameter of only 51 inches (130 cm) and a small internal firebox, was mounted above. The \\"regenerator\\", capturing heat from the exhaust, was integral with the boiler and had 38 tubes totalling a heating area of 508 sq ft (47m2). The driving position was in the usual place behind the boiler, and tanks‚Äî for fuel and for water‚Äîwere mounted above one another on the frame at the rear. =Operation= The sequence of operation was to heat the boiler in the normal way, but using fuel oil instead of coal. The start from rest would be made with steam power, but at about five mph (8 km/h) the diesel injectors would be started and the steam turned off. The waste heat from the cylinder jackets and diesel exhaust then maintained the boiler in steam for auxiliary functions (brakes and whistle) and in readiness to supplement the diesel power if required, or for the next start. The temperature of the water jacket, maintained at considerably above boiling point, assisted the compression ignition of the diesel fuel and only a relatively low compression ratio was required.Franco; Labryn (1931) p49 By using steam for starting, no form of variable transmission was necessary and a permanent reduction geartrain of ratio 1¬∑878 to 1 was fitted. Overall power output did not compare well with conventional steam locomotives, although the performance on gradients was good because of the gearing. During the trials it was used successfully with coal trains and it proved very efficient in terms of fuel used, because the waste heat from the diesel power was recovered. However its running costs depended on the price differential between coal and oil and this was not favourable. When Kitson & Co. failed in 1934 the LNER handed the machine back to the company's receivers and it was dismantled. Cristiani compressed steam system The Italian Cristiani Compressed Steam System used the process of mechanical vapour recompression. A diesel engine compressed steam which was then fed to conventional steam engine cylinders. The exhaust steam was re-compressed and used again. There must have been a small boiler to generate the initial charge of steam but this is not shown in the diagram.http://www.douglas- self.com/MUSEUM/LOCOLOCO/compsteam/compsteam.htm The steam was used mainly as a transmission system but the locomotive does count as a hybrid because some steam storage was provided. A possible advantage of the system was that it enabled existing steam locomotives to be converted to diesel operation but this did not come to fruition. Patents for the system were held by Severino Cristiani and Secondo Sacerdole in Italy and it was promoted in England by Captain William Peter Durtnall.http://www.steamindex.com/people/intcomb.htm A trial was made in England, using two \\"Paragon\\" marine petrol engines, under the name \\"Paragon-Cristiani\\". The equipment was mounted on a 0-6-0 chassis (works number 3513/1923) built by Hawthorn Leslie and Company. It was not a success and the chassis was converted to a conventional 0-6-0ST named \\"Stagshaw\\" which is preserved on the Tanfield Railway.http://www.steamindex.com/backtrak/bt23.htm Other trials Soviet Locomotive TP1Stalinets =Soviet Union= Soviet Union built three large experimental locomotives between 1939 and 1946. The first prototype, numbered 8000, a 2-8-2 from the Vorishilovgrad works, had two pairs of outside double action opposing pistons; when diesel power was initiated, at about , diesel fuel was injected into the centre portion between the pistons which thus became the compression-ignition chamber, while the outer ends of the cylinders continued to receive steam in the normal way. Although the unit remained in passenger service, intermittently, until 1946, when it was tested again. It was put into storage in 1948. It was not considered a success as its 25-tonne axle load was too high, it rode hard on the tracks and was prone to cracking cylinders. TP1-1, the second prototype (illustrated right), under the name of –°—Ç–∞–ª–∏–Ω–µ—Ü (Stalinets), was a cab-forward condensing 2-10-2 from the Kolomna works, used gas produced from an anthracite plant in the tender to fuel its spark-ignition internal combustion cylinders and pulverised anthracite to heat the boiler. It was reported to have only functioned properly at speeds of 25-30 km/h and below as travelling faster for about 10-15 minutes would cause the gas mixture to combust prematurely when entering the combustion chamber. Issues were reportedly sorted out by 1941 but the project was abandoned during Operation Barbarossa and the outbreak of WW2 on Soviet territory. Number 8001, The third experiment, also named –°—Ç–∞–ª–∏–Ω–µ—Ü, was a unit developed from the previous Voroshilovgrad design in 1946. It was increased to a 2-10-2 configuration and had the centre space in the cylinders, between the pistons, intended to combine compression ignition and steam expansive working in the same chamber. It was reportedly almost a complete disaster and placed in storage in 1948. =Switzerland= In 1925, Jakob Buchli of Switzerland obtained US patent 1559548 for a combined steam and internal-combustion engined locomotive. This differed from the Kitson-Still system in that there was no waste heat recovery and the steam and internal combustion engines had separate cylinders (vertically mounted in the tender), but both driving the same traction wheels. Buchli specified that \\"‚Ä¶the steam generator is supported upon one vehicle‚Ä¶and the steam and internal combustion engine cylinders together with their driving gear are carried by a separate truck or vehicle\\". His proposal was for the \\"steam generator vehicle\\" to be in the form of a traditional steam locomotive boiler with driver's cab, but without pistons. A \\"flexible pipe\\" would lead steam to the pistons within the \\"detachably coupled‚Ä¶truck\\" (tender). His claimed advantages were the reduced complexity of a combined transmission system, the improved comfort of the operators being separated from the driving cylinders and the differing maintenance requirements of steam and diesel (such as boiler washouts) being more easily accommodated when the units were detachable. It is not known whether any locomotives to Buchli's design were actually built. =United States= In 1954 Chicago inventor Charles Denker patented a system whereby the exhaust from a conventional four-stroke diesel engine was directed into a large- diameter steam cylinder. There was no boiler: instead a pump, operated by a cam driven from the common crankshaft, injected water (warmed by the diesel cylinder water jacket) into the steam cylinder so that it was instantly evaporated by the hot exhaust gases, powering the piston by expansion. Again, no operational examples are known. References Notes * Atkins, Philip (1999): The golden age of steam locomotive building.

Santa Maria in Campitelli or Santa Maria in Portico is a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary on the narrow Piazza di Campitelli in Rione Sant'Angelo, Rome, Italy. History Tradition holds that a primitive oratory or church was founded at the site during the years 523-526, under the papacy of John I. This structure was located near the Porticus Octaviae (giving the church and icon its name of \\"Madonna of the Portico\\"). The structure was created to house a venerated 25 cm-high icon of the Virgin Mary and Saints Peter and Paul. Tradition claimed the icon appeared miraculously in 524 at the table of Galla, a Roman woman who was helping the poor, and it was said to be carried in processions since 590. The initial church structure was the no-longer extant Oratory of Santa Galla, located across the piazza from the present church, and which was attached to a hospital of the same name. More recent analysis of the style and dendrochronology of the icon date it to the 11th century. Circa 1656, the city of Rome was ravaged by plague, and it was felt that the prayers to this icon, which had been carried in procession through the streets, had played a role in stopping the epidemic. This putative miraculous intervention prompted Pope Alexander VII to erect a grander church, instead of the ancient oratory, to house the icon. He commissioned the high Baroque design from Carlo Rainaldi, and construction took place between 1659 and 1667. The church was kept under the maintenance by the order of Clerics Regular of the Mother of God, that had been founded in Lucca.Guida metodica di Roma e suoi contorni, by Giuseppe Melchiorri, Rome (1836); page 326. Rainaldi's facade has a complex stacking of two levels of travertine Corinthian (below) and composite columns, detached from the facade, and emphasizing a strong vertical lines. The original design included statues which were however never executed. The portal has an inscription offering plenary indulgence daily to the living and dead. Santa Maria in Portico is a diaconate; it has as its current Cardinal-Deacon Michael Louis Fitzgerald. Interior View towards main altar and gilded glory. Marble bas-relief depicting the Holy Family and Blessed Ludovica Albertoni by Ottoni. The main altar of the church houses the icon in a gilded glory or gloria of angels, clouds and rays of light, recalling the effects used by Bernini for the apse of Basilica of St Peter. This main altar was designed circa 1666 by either the Bernini pupil Melchiorre Caff√†, or by Giovanni Antonio de Rossi. There is a staircase behind the 'gloria' allowing a better view of the icon, open by request only. The first chapel on the right has an altarpiece depicting St Michael Archangel by Sebastiano Conca. The second chapel, designed by Rainaldi, has an altarpiece depicting Saints Anne, Joseph, and Mary by Luca Giordano. The angels are by Michel Maille, Francesco Cavallini, and Francesco Baratta. The third chapel on the right displays an ancient Roman alabaster column, previously part of the old oratory. In the right crossing is the funerary monument of Cardinal Bartolomeo Pacca (died 1863), sculpted by Ferdinando Pettrich. The main altar (of 1667), designed by Rainaldi, was completed by Antonio De Rossi, Ferrata and Giovanni Paolo Schor. The main altar enshrines the small icon of the Virgin mentioned above. In the third chapel to the left is an altarpiece depicting the Conversion of St Paul by Ludovico Gimignani. The ceiling was frescoed by Ricciolini. This chapel was commissioned by a member of the Capizucchi family, and designed by Mattia de Rossi. The second chapel on the left was commissioned by Cardinal Paluzzo Paluzzi Altieri degli Albertoni, and designed by Giovanni Battista Contini. The angels in the cardinal's funerary monument here were sculpted by Giuseppe Mazzuoli. The main altarpiece was painted by Il Baciccia, while the ceiling frescoes were painted by Giacinto Calandrucci. In the first chapel on the left, was refurbished (1705) by commission of Prince Angelo Altieri, and designed by Sebastiano Cipriani. The bas-relief altarpiece depicts a Holy Family and Blessed Ludovica Albertoni by Lorenzo Ottoni.Melchiorri, page 327. The site chosen for this church included the location of the house where Ludovica Albertoni had lived. In 1669 Gaspare Paluzzi Albertoni had married Laura Caterina Altieri, niece of Pope Clement X. This Pope, whose family name would have otherwise died, had this Albertoni change their surnames to Altieri. Flanking the Baroque Ottoni relief are two neoclassical funerary monuments of Altieri family members. To the left of the facade is a fountain by Giacomo della Porta.

His son, Joe White, currently plays for Bristol Rovers, having signed his first professional contract in the summer of 2008. Playing career White's career spanned over 500 appearances for nine league clubs, including Bristol Rovers, Luton Town, Swindon Town and Cardiff City. He helped Swindon in several promotion campaigns and played a crucial role in the 1993 play-off victory over Leicester City at Wembley Stadium when he came off the bench to win a penalty. White is still held in great affection at the County Ground. His time at the club was notable for frequently straying offside, pulling his shorts up high and invariably scoring many goals. He was a very awkward player to play against for opposition centre halves. The esteem for White was demonstrated when he returned to Swindon with Hereford for a cup tie. His goal for the visitors was cheered equally heartily by home fans as away. White came second in the BBC Football Focus Swindon Cult Heroes poll behind Don Rogers In August 1994 he signed for Hereford United and quickly became a fan's favourite (\\"Chalky\\" White) at Edgar Street by scoring 44 goals in 76 league appearances. 1995‚Äì96 was arguably his best playing season when his prolific strike rate propelled Hereford from 19th to 6th in two months. His 29 league goals made him top goalscorer in the top four English divisions. After failing to gain promotion via the play-offs, he left Hereford and signed for Cardiff City. Whilst at Cardiff he played 6 games on Loan at Cwmbran Town scoring 4 goals in the time he was there. He was initially in the frame for Bath City's managerial post but instead joined as player assistant to Paul Bodin in June 1998. He scored 12 times in his first season at Twerton Park showing even at 40 years of age he had lost little of his skill in front of goal. White reduced his appearances during the next two years to an occasional outing and left the club in February 2001 in an attempt to return to the professional game in a coaching capacity. He became director of football at Southampton's academy, and became manager of Chippenham Town in November 2003. He resigned in June 2005 after applying for the vacant managerial post at Bath City.

Note: The same country can fall in multiple categories; the colour given to a country corresponds to the highest listed category in which a country falls. The right to food, and its variations, is a human right protecting the right of people to feed themselves in dignity, implying that sufficient food is available, that people have the means to access it, and that it adequately meets the individual's dietary needs. The right to food protects the right of all human beings to be free from hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition.: \\"What is the right to food?\\" The right to food does not imply that governments have an obligation to hand out free food to everyone who wants it, or a right to be fed. However, if people are deprived of access to food for reasons beyond their control, for example, because they are in detention, in times of war or after natural disasters, the right requires the government to provide food directly.: \\"Right to Food.\\" The right is derived from the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which has 170 state parties as of April 2020. States that sign the covenant agree to take steps to the maximum of their available resources to achieve progressively the full realization of the right to adequate food, both nationally and internationally.: article 2(1), 11(1) and 23. In a total of 106 countries the right to food is applicable either via constitutional arrangements of various forms or via direct applicability in law of various international treaties in which the right to food is protected.: 32. At the 1996 World Food Summit, governments reaffirmed the right to food and committed themselves to halve the number of hungry and malnourished from 840 to 420 million by 2015. However, the number has increased over the past years, reaching an infamous record in 2009 of more than 1 billion undernourished people worldwide. Furthermore, the number who suffer from hidden hunger ‚Äì micronutrient deficiences that may cause stunted bodily and intellectual growth in children ‚Äì amounts to over 2 billion people worldwide.: 12. Whilst under international law states are obliged to respect, protect and fulfill the right to food, the practical difficulties in achieving this human right are demonstrated by prevalent food insecurity across the world, and ongoing litigation in countries such as India.Westcott, Catherine and Nadia Khoury and CMS Cameron McKenna,The Right to Food, (Advocates for International Development, October 2011)http://a4id.org/sites/default/files/user/Right%20to%20Food%20Legal%20Guide.pdf. In the continents with the biggest food-related problems ‚Äì Africa, Asia and South America ‚Äì not only is there shortage of food and lack of infrastructure but also maldistribution and inadequate access to food.: iii.  Definition  The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recognizes the \\"right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food\\", as well as the \\"fundamental right to be free from hunger\\". The relationship between the two concepts is not straightforward. For example, \\"freedom from hunger\\" (which General Comment 12 designates as more pressing and immediate.) could be measured by the number of people suffering from malnutrition and at the extreme, dying of starvation. The \\"right to adequate food\\" is a much higher standard, including not only absence of malnutrition, but to the full range of qualities associated with food, including safety, variety and dignity, in short all those elements needed to enable an active and healthy life. Inspired by the above definition, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food in 2002 defined it as follows: > The right to have regular, permanent and unrestricted access, either > directly or by means of financial purchases, to quantitatively and > qualitatively adequate and sufficient food corresponding to the cultural > traditions of the people to which the consumer belongs, and which ensure a > physical and mental, individual and collective, fulfilling and dignified > life free of fear.: para. 17; quoted in . This definition entails all normative elements explained in detail in the General Comment 12 of the ICESCR, which states: > the right to adequate food is realized when every man, woman and child, > alone or in community with others, have the physical and economic access at > all times to adequate food or means for its procurement.: para. 6. =What the right to food is not= According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the right to food does not imply that governments have an obligation to hand out free food to everyone who wants it. This is a common misconception. > The right to food is not a right to a minimum ration of calories, proteins > and other specific nutrients, or a right to be fed. It is about being > guaranteed the right to feed oneself, which requires not only that food is > available ‚Äì that the ratio of production to the population is sufficient ‚Äì > but also that it is accessible ‚Äì i.e., that each household either has the > means to produce or buy its own food. However, if individuals are deprived > of access to food for reasons beyond their control, for instance because of > an armed conflict, natural disaster or because they are in detention, > recognition of the right to life obliges States to provide them with > sufficient food for their survival.. = Dimensions = The former Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, Jean Ziegler, defined three dimensions to the right to food. *Availability refers to the possibilities either for feeding oneself directly from productive land or other natural resources, or for well functioning distribution, processing and market systems that can move food from the site of production to where it is needed in accordance with demand. *Accessibility implies that economic and physical access to food is to be guaranteed. On the one hand, economic access means that food should be affordable for an adequate diet without compromising other basic needs. On the other hand, physically vulnerable, such as sick, children, disabled or elderly should also have access to food. *Adequacy implies that the food must satisfy the dietary needs of every individual, taking into account age, living conditions, health, occupation, sex, culture and religion, for example. The food must be safe and adequate protective measures by both public and private means must be taken to prevent contamination of foodstuffs through adulteration and/or through bad environmental hygiene or inappropriate handling at different stages throughout the food chain; care must also be taken to identify and avoid or destroy naturally occurring toxins. Furthermore, any discrimination in access to food, as well as to means and entitlements for its procurement, on the grounds of race, colour, sex, language, age, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status constitutes a violation of the right to food. = Agreed-upon food standards = Regarding the right to food, the international community also specified commonly agreed on standards, such as in the 1974 World Food Conference, the 1974 International Undertaking on World Food Security, the 1977 Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, the 1986 Declaration on the Right to Development, the ECOSOC Resolution 1987/90, the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, and the 1996 Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements.: footnote 23.  History  = Negative or positive right = There is a traditional distinction between two types of human rights. On the one hand, negative or abstract rights that are respected by non-intervention. On the other hand, positive or concrete rights that require resources for its realisation. However, it is nowadays contested whether it is possible to clearly distinguish between these two types of rights.: \\"The road from Magna Carta.\\" The right to food can accordingly be divided into the negative right to obtain food by one's own actions, and the positive right to be supplied with food if one is unable to access it. The negative right to food was recognised as early as in England's 1215 Magna Carta which reads that: \\"no one shall be 'amerced' (fined) to the extent that they are deprived of their means of living.\\" = International developments from 1941 onwards = This section provides an overview of international developments relevant to the establishment and implementation of the right to food from the mid-20th century onwards.: 4. *1941 ‚Äì In his Four Freedoms speech, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt includes as one of the freedoms:: 10. > \\"The freedom from want.\\" Later this freedom formed part of the 1945 United Nations Charter (Article 1(3)). *1948 ‚Äì Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognises the right to food as part of the right to an adequate standard of living: > \\"Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and > well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing > and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in > the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other > lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control\\" (Article 25). *1966 ‚Äì The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, reiterates the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with regard to the right to an adequate standard of living and, in addition, specifically recognises the right to be free from hunger. The covenant, states parties recognise: > \\"the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for himself and his > family, including adequate food\\" (Article 11.1) and \\"the fundamental right > of everyone to be free from hunger\\" (Article 11.2). **1976 ‚Äì Entry into force of the Covenant. **1987 ‚Äì Establishment of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights overseeing the implementation of the Covenant and beginning a more legal interpretation of the Covenant. **1999 ‚Äì The Committee adopts General Comment No. 12 'The Right to Adequate Food', describing the various State obligations derived from the Covenant regarding the right to food. **2009 ‚Äì Adoption of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, making the right to food justiciable at the international level. *1974 ‚Äì Adoption of the Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition at the World Food Conference.. *1988 ‚Äì Adoption of the right to food in the Additional Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights in the area of Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (the \\"Protocol of San Salvador\\"). *1996 ‚Äì The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) organises the 1996 World Food Summit in Rome, resulting in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security. **2004 ‚Äì The FAO adopts the Right to Food Guidelines, offering guidance to States on how to implement their obligations on the right to food. The drafting of the guidelines was initiated as a result of the 2002 World Food Summit. *2000 ‚Äì The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food is established.: \\"Mandate.\\" *2000 ‚Äì Adoption of the Millennium Development Goals, including Goal 1: to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger by 2015. *2012 ‚Äì The Food Assistance Convention is adopted as a result of the Food Aid Convention (1985?), making it the first legally binding international treaty on food aid. Amartya Sen won his 1998 Nobel Prize in part for his work in demonstrating that famine and mass starvation in modern times was not typically the product of a lack of food; rather, it usually arose from problems in food distribution networks or from government policies.  Legal status  The right to food is protected under international human rights and humanitarian law.: 10-12. = International law = The right to food is recognized in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 25) as part of the right to an adequate standard of living, and is enshrined in the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (Article 11). The 2009 Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights makes the right to food justiciable at the international level. In 2012, the Food Assistance Convention is adopted, making it the first legally binding international treaty on food aid. = International instruments = It is also recognized in many specific international instruments as varied as the 1948 Genocide Convention (Article 2), the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (Articles 20 and 23),: 11. the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child (Articles 24(2)(c) and 27(3)), the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (Articles 12(2)), or the 2007 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (Articles 25(f) and 28(1)). = Regional instruments = The right to food is also recognized in regional instruments, such as the 1988 Additional Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights in the area of Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights or \\"Protocol of San Salvador\\" (Article 12), the 1990 African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, the 2001 African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights recognition that the right to food falls under the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights,: para. 64-66 (p. 26). and the 2003 Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa or \\"Maputo Protocol\\" (Article 15). There are also such instruments in many national constitutions. = Non-legally binding instruments = There are several non-legally binding international human rights instruments relevant to the right to food. They include recommendations, guidelines, resolutions or declarations. The most detailed is the 2004 Right to Food Guidelines. They are a practical tool to help implement the right to adequate food. The Right to Food Guidelines are not legally binding but draw upon international law and are a set of recommendations States have chosen on how to implement their obligations under Article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Finally, the 1945 Constitution of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization provides that: > \\"the Nations accepting this Constitution, being determined to promote the > common welfare by furthering separate and collective action on their part > for the purpose of: raising levels of nutrition and standards of living . . > . and thus . . . ensuring humanity's freedom from hunger. . . .\\" (Preamble). = Other documents = In 1993, the International Food Security Treaty is developed in USA and Canada. In 1998, a Conference on Consensus Strategy on the Right To Food held in Santa Barbara, California, USA with anti-hunger experts from five continents.: \\"About the IFST.\\" In 2010, a group of national and international organisations create a proposal to replace the European Union Common Agricultural Policy, which is due for change in 2013. The first article of The New Common Food and Agriculture Policy \\"considers food as a universal human right, not merely a commodity.\\".  State obligations  State obligations related to the right to food are well-established under international law. By signing the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) states agreed to take steps to the maximum of their available resources to achieve progressively the full realization of the right to adequate food. They also acknowledge the essential role of international cooperation and assistance in this context.: article 2(1), 11(1) and 23; : \\"What is the right to food?\\" This obligation was reaffirmed by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR). Signatories to the Right to Food Guidelines also committed to implementing the right to food at a national level. In General Comment no. 12, the CESCR interpreted the states' obligation as being of three types: the obligation to respect, protect and to fulfil: # Respect implies that states must never arbitrarily prevent people from having access to food. # Protect means that states should take measures to ensure that enterprises or individuals do not deprive individuals of their access to adequate food. # Fulfil (facilitate and provide) entails that governments must pro-actively engage in activities intended to strengthen people's access to and utilization of resources and means to ensure their livelihood, including food security. If, for reasons beyond their control such as at times of war or after a natural disaster, groups or individuals are unable to enjoy their right to food, then states have the obligation to provide that right directly.: \\"What is the right to food?\\" These were again endorsed by states, when the FAO Council adopted the Right to Food Guidelines. The ICESCR recognises that the right to freedom from hunger requires international cooperation, and relates to matters of production, the agriculture and global supply. Article 11 states that: > \\"The States Parties to the present Covenant... shall take, individually and > through international co-operation, the measures, including specific > programmes, which are needed: (a) To improve methods of production, > conservation and distribution of food by making full use of technical and > scientific knowledge, by disseminating knowledge of the principles of > nutrition and by developing or reforming agrarian systems in such a way as > to achieve the most efficient development and utilization of natural > resources; (b) Taking into account the problems of both food-importing and > food-exporting countries, to ensure an equitable distribution of world food > supplies in relation to need.\\" The implementation of the right to food standards at national level has consequences for national constitutions, laws, courts, institutions, policies and programmes, and for various food security topics, such as fishing, land, focus on vulnerable groups, and access to resources. National strategies on the progressive realization of the right to food should fulfill four functions: # define the obligations corresponding to the right to adequate food, whether these are the obligations of government or those of private actors; # improve the coordination between the different branches of government whose activities and programs may affect the realization of the right to food; # set targets, ideally associated with measurable indicators, defining the timeframe within which particular objectives should be achieved; # provide for a mechanism ensuring that the effect of new legislative initiatives or policies on the right. ;International The right to food imposes on all States obligations not only towards the persons living on their national territory, but also towards the populations of other States. The right to food is only realised when both national and international obligations are complied with. On the one hand, is the effect of the international environment and, in particular, climate change, malnutrition and food insecurity. On the other hand, the international community can only contribute if legal frameworks and institutions are established at the national level. ;Non-discrimination Under article 2(2) of the ICESCR, governments agreed that the right to food will be exercised without discrimination on grounds of sex, colour, race, age, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. The CESCR stresses the special attention that should be given to disadvantaged and marginalized farmers, including women farmers, in a rural context.: para. 7.  Adoption around the world  = Framework law = thumb300pxleftCountries that are developing or have adopted framework laws on the right to food (19). A framework law is a \\"legislative technique used to address cross-sectoral issues.\\": 30. Framework laws are more specific than a constitutional provision, as it lays down general obligations and principles. However, competent authorities and further legislation which still have to determine specific measures should be taken.: 30-1. The adoption of framework laws was recommended by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as a \\"major instrument in the implementation of the national strategy concerning the right to food\\".: para. 29; cited in There are ten countries that have adopted and nine countries that are developing framework laws on food security or the right to food. This development is likely to increase in the coming years. Often they are known as food security laws instead of right to food laws, but their effect is usually similar. Advantages of framework law includes that the content and scope of the right can be further specified, state and private actor obligations can be spelled out in detail, appropriate institutional mechanisms can be established, and rights to remedies can be provided for. Further advantages of framework laws include: strengthening government accountability, monitoring, helping government officials understand their role, improving access to courts and by providing administrative recourse mechanisms. However, provisions for obligations and remedies in existing framework law is not always very thorough, and it is neither always clear what they add to the justiciability of the right to food. As of 2011, the following ten countries have adopted a framework law on food security or the right to food: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Indonesia, Nicaragua, Peru and Venezuela. Moreover, in 2011 the following nine countries were drafting a framework law on food security or the right to food: Honduras, India, Malawi, Mexico, Mozambique, Paraguay, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda. Finally, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Peru are drafting to update, replace or strengthen their framework law. = Constitutional = thumb300pxCountries with the explicit constitutional right to food (23). Note: Brazil has all three and South Africa has the former two; they are included in each category, but counted once for the total. thumb300pxCountries in which the constitutional right to food is implicit in broader rights, or in which it is explicit in directive principles (41). Note: Ethiopia, Malawi and Pakistan occur in both categories; they are included in each category, but counted once for the total. There are various ways in which constitutions can take the right to food or some aspect of it into account.: 14. As of 2011, 56 constitutions protect the right to food in some form or another. The three main categories of constitutional recognition are: as an explicit right, as implied in broader human rights or as part of a directive principle. In addition to those, the right can also indirectly be recognised when other human rights are interpreted by a judiciary.  Explicit as a right  Firstly, the right to food is explicitly and directly recognised as a right in itself or as part of a broader human right in 23 countries.: 14; 36. Three different forms can be distinguished. 1\\\\. The following nine countries recognise the right to food as a separate and stand-alone right: Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Guyana, Haiti, Kenya, South Africa, in the Interim Constitution of Nepal (as food sovereignty) and Nicaragua (as freedom from hunger).: 21. 2\\\\. For a specific segment of the population the right to food is recognised in ten countries. Provisions regarding the right to food of children are present in the constitutions of: Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, and South Africa. The right to food of indigenous children is protected in the constitution of Costa Rica. Finally, the right to food of detainees and prisoners is additionally recognised in the constitution of South Africa. 3\\\\. Five countries recognize the right to food explicitly as part of a human right to an adequate standard of living, quality of life, or development: Belarus, the Congo, Malawi, Moldova and Ukraine, and two recognise it as part of the right to work: Brazil and Suriname. The XX. article of the Fundamental Law of Hungary recognizes the right to food as a part of a human right to health.https://jak.ppke.hu/uploads/articles/12332/file/Kovacs_Julcsi_tezisak.pdf  Implicit or as directive principle  Secondly, the following 31 countries implicitly recognise the right to food in broader human rights: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Bolivia, Burundi, Cambodia, Czech Rep., Congo, Costa Rica, Cyprus, Ecuador, El Salvador, Eq.uatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Finland, Georgia, Germany, Ghana, Guatemala, Guinea, Kyrgyzstan, Malawi, Netherlands, Pakistan, Peru, Romania, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Venezuela.: 35-6. Thirdly, the following thirteen countries explicitly recognise the right to food within the constitution as a directive principle or goal: Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, Iran, Malawi, Nigeria, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Pakistan, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Uganda. = Applicable via international law = thumb300pxleftCountries which have ratified international law in which the right to food is recognised, and in which at the same time international law is primary or equal to national law (103). In some countries international treaties have a higher status than or equal status to national legislation. Consequently, the right to food may be directly applicable via international treaties if such country is member to a treaty in which the right is recognised. Such treaties include the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). Excluding countries in which the right to food is implicitly or explicitly recognised in their constitution, the right is directly applicable in at least 51 additional countries via international treaties.: 23, 32. = Commitment via ICESCR = ;ICESCR Parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights have to do everything to guarantee adequate nutrition, including legislating to that effect. The Covenant has become part of national legislation in over 77 countries. In these countries the provision for the right to food in the Covenant can be cited in a court. This has happened in Argentina (in the case of the right to health).: 21; see also : 27-8. thumb300pxCountries that committed to the right to food by ratifying the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (160). Note: All parties to the optional protocol are also member to the covenant. However, citizens usually cannot prosecute using the Covenant, but can only do so under national law. If a country does not pass such laws a citizen has no redress, even though the state violated the covenant. The implementation of the Covenant is monitored through the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.;: 20. In total, 160 countries have ratified the Covenant. A further 32 countries have not ratified the covenant, although 7 of them did sign it. ;Optional protocol By signing the Optional Protocol to the ICESCR, states recognise the competence of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to receive and consider: Article 1. complaints from individuals or groups who claim their rights under the Covenant have been violated.: Article 2. However, complainants must have exhausted all domestic remedies.: Article 3. The Committee can \\"examine\\",: Article 8. works towards \\"friendly settlement\\",: Article 7. in the case of grave or systematic violations of the Covenant, it can \\"invite that State Party to cooperate\\" and, finally, could \\"include a summary account of the results of the proceedings in its annual report\\".: Article 11. The following seven countries have ratified the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights: Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mongolia, Slovakia, and Spain. A further 32 countries have signed the optional protocol.  Mechanisms to achieve the right to food  The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, Mr. De Schutter, urged the establishment in law of the right to food, so that it can be translated into national strategies and institutions. Furthermore, he recommended emerging economies to protect the rights of land users, in particular of minority and vulnerable groups. He also advised to support smallholder agriculture in the face of mega-development projects, and to stop soil and water degradation through massive shifts to agroecological practices. Finally, the UN expert suggested adopting a strategy to tackle rising obesity., para. 3. The United Nations' Article 11 on the Right to Adequate Food suggests several implementation mechanisms. The Article acknowledges that the most appropriate ways and means of implementing the right to adequate food will inevitably vary significantly from one State to another. Every State must choose its own approaches, but the Covenant clearly requires that each State party take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that everyone is free from hunger and as soon as possible can enjoy the right to adequate food. The Article emphasizes that the right to food requires full compliance with the principles of accountability, transparency, people's participation, decentralization, legislative capacity and the independence of the judiciary. In terms of strategy to implement the right to food, the Article asks that the States should identify and address critical issues in regard to all aspects of the food system, including the food production and processing, food storage, retail distribution, marketing and its consumption. The implementation strategy should give particular attention to the need to prevent discrimination in access to food shops and retail network, or alternatively to resources for growing food. As part of their obligations to protect people's resource base for food, States should take appropriate steps to ensure that activities of the private business sector and civil society are in conformity with the right to food. The Article notes that whenever a State faces severe resource constraints, whether caused by a process of economic adjustment, economic recession, climatic conditions or other factors, measures should be undertaken to ensure that the right to adequate food is especially fulfilled for vulnerable population groups and individuals. = Interrelation to other rights = The idea of the interdependence and indivisibility of all human rights was a founding principle of the United Nations. This was recognised in the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action which reads \\"all human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent and interrelated.\\" The right to food is considered interlinked with the following human rights in particular: right to life, right to livelihood, right to health, right to property, freedom of expression, freedom of information, right to education, freedom of association, and the right to water.: 14. Other relevant rights include: the right to work, the right to social security, the right to social welfare,: 13. and the right to an adequate standard of living. For example, according to the Committee overseeing the implementation of the ICESCR, \\"the right to water is a prerequisite for the realization of other human rights.\\" The need to have adequate water in order to have adequate food is in particular evident in the case of peasant farmers. Access to sustainable water resources for agriculture needs to be ensured to realise the right to food.: para. 1. This applies even more strongly to subsistence agriculture.

He was elected governor of Okinawa Prefecture in 2006.  History  Nakaima was born on August 19, 1939 in Higashinari Ward of Osaka. He is of Ryukyuan descent. Nakaima is descended from a Chinese family with the surname of Cai, one of the 36 Han Chinese Kumemura families who moved to Okinawa in 1392.Êµ∑„Çí„ÇÜ„ÅèÂ∑®ÈæçÔºöËª¢ÊèõÊúü„ÅÆÂÆâ‰øùÔºíÔºêÔºëÔºê ‰∏≠ÂõΩ„Åß„ÄåÊ≤ñÁ∏ÑËøî„Åõ„Äç„ÅÆÂ£∞Ôºà„Åù„ÅÆÔºíÊ≠¢ÔºâÊØéÊó•Êñ∞ËÅû2010Âπ¥8Êúà18Êó•Êù±‰∫¨ÁâàÊúùÂàä„ÄÅ‰ª≤‰∫ïÁúüÂºòÂ§öÂæåÊè¥ÊúÉ In 1945 during World War II, his family escaped from the air raids in Osaka and evacuated to Meiji, Minamiamabe District, Oita Prefecture. In 1946 he returned to his parents' hometown of Naha, Okinawa. There he graduated from Kainan Elementary School, Uenoyama Junior High School, and Naha Senior High School. Nakaima excelled in math and science, earning grades that placed him at the top of his class. Pursuing a dream of becoming an automobile designer, Nakaima sat for an exam to apply for the Government-funded/Self-funded Okinawa Student Program, a system established between the United States Military Government in Okinawa and the Japanese Government to allow students from Okinawa to attend university in mainland Japan. Nakaima passed the exam and matriculated at the University of Tokyo, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in 1961. Directly after graduating in 1961, Nakaima joined the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). In the 1980s, Nakaima served as the Director General of the Commerce and Industry Department at the Okinawa General Bureau and later as the Deputy Director-General for Technology Affairs at MITI's Agency of Industrial Science and Technology. In 1987, Nakaima took a Senior General Manager position with the Okinawa Electric Power Company. In 1990, he left the company to become a Vice Governor in the administration of Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota. Nakaima returned to the Okinawa Electric Power Company in 1995, serving as the company's President and later Chairman of the Board of Directors. In 2006 the Liberal Democratic Party and the New K≈çmeit≈ç gave him backing for his run in the Okinawa gubernatorial election on November 19. In the election, Nakaima defeated Keiko Itokazu, who received the recommendation of five opposition parties. Nakaima assumed the office of Governor on December 10, 2006. He was re-elected for a second term on November 28, 2010, defeating Yoichi Iha. In December 2013, Nakaima approved a landfill proposal by the Japanese government to permit the construction of new military facilities in Henoko to replace Marine Corps Air Station Futenma. The decision came two days after Tokyo earmarked 348 billion yen for Okinawa's economic development and despite earlier campaign promises by Nakaima to move the base outside of the prefecture altogether. On May 10, 2014, Nakaima sent his congratulations to the openly revisionist lobby Nippon Kaigi for a sport event it held in OkinawaNippon Kaigi website - June 30, 2014 Nakaima lost his bid for a second re-election on November 16, 2014, losing to former Naha mayor Takeshi Onaga. Onaga opposed the plan to move the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma base to Henoko Bay, while Nakaima supported it.

It was originally developed in 2005 by Jeremie Miller . A MicroID is a simple identifier comprising a hashed communication/identity URI (e.g. email, OpenID, and/or Yadis) and claimed URL. Together, the two elements create a hash that can be claimed by third-party services. Ben Laurie demonstrated privacy problems with it in 2006 , as did Chris Erway in a Brown CS Technical Report in 2008  MicroID exchange  Here is an example of a MicroID hash, in pseudocode: MicroID = sha1( sha1(\\"mailto:user@example.com\\") + sha1(\\"http://example.net/\\") ); The computed MicroID would then be placed on a web page to be claimed. A verifier, which would independently generate the MicroID, would then visit the page to see if the generated MicroID is the same as the MicroID on the page. If they are the same, a claim exists. MicroID is based on a communication URI. Since both the MicroID provider and verifier can verify the communication URI, a proper MicroID implementation allows for trusted identity claims.  Security limitations  A MicroID is essentially a content URI signed with an email address or other attribution. Since the content URI is known for comparison purposes, a MicroID claim can be forged by anybody who knows the communication URI (e.g. email address) associated with the identity. In particular, since a verifier must generate the MicroID in order to compare it, it follows that any party who is trusted to verify a user's MicroID must also be trusted to generate new authorship claims with it. So if you can verify - you can forge. Or in other words anyone (e.g. Alice) who can verify someone (e.g. Bob) their MicroID on a resource 'X' can also generate (spoof) a MicroID on any other document (e.g. Alice can generate a valid MicroID for a document Y, not equal to X, in Bob's name). Assuming the identity is not known (e.g. 1) the publisher has chosen to remain anonymous and 2) denies others the ability to verify the MicroID claim until a time in the future when he or she reveals her identity) then someone with email addresses can perform a trivial dictionary attack to find ownership of resources, someone with a URI can perform a trivial dictionary attack to find an email address. So the (only) remaining usecase is where an entity generates a strong cryptographic nonce (e.g. a UUID); uses this to publish documents over time‚Äîand at some time in the future reveals the UUID as to prove that he or she wrote those documents (and accepts that from that point forward anyone can make any claims on his or her behalf).  Privacy limitations  As explained above, a MicroID is a hash made from a public URI and a semi public email. Those who know both can verify the identity claim on a page. The hashing helps to hide the semi public email address to people that should not know it, in particular spammers. However, research on popular social websites such as Last.fm, Digg and ClaimID show that a brute-force attack can decrypt the email address in 20‚Äì25% of the cases. The brute force attack guesses email addresses derived from the public user name and other information available on the social websites, and thus only checks a dozen or so candidate addresses per MicroID. Despite this, the study showed a simple attack like this one could still be successful one quarter of the time while spending a fraction of a second to check all candidates for each user. The hashing scheme thus does not guarantee the privacy of the email address.  Architecture of a MicroID claim  An example of a successful MicroID claim is as follows: # A user signs up for a web service. That web service verifies the user's email, and creates public web pages for the user that contain a MicroID. That MicroID comprises the hashed email (communication URI) and the URL of the webpage. # The user then signs up for a verifier service. The service also verifies the user's email. # The user inputs the URL of the page she wishes to claim into the verifier service. The verifier service computes the MicroID and attempts to verify the MicroID in the claimed page. # If the MicroID in claimed page is the same as the one in the verifier service, a claim exists. The verifier will then claim ownership of the page.  MicroID and the DOM  MicroID allows for the claiming of semantic HTML elements. For example, a MicroID inserted in a block-level element will constitute an ownership claim of anything in the element. A MicroID inserted in the header of a page will constitute an ownership claim of the page. Claims are only verifiable at the granularity of URIs.

The long-serving dictator Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya was ousted by the Armed Forces of Mauritania and replaced by the Military Council for Justice and Democracy (CMJD), headed by Ely Ould Mohamed Vall, while Taya was in Saudi Arabia attending the funeral of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. A constitutional referendum, parliamentary and presidential elections were scheduled and the coup leaders vowed not to contest any of the elections. The military government ended with the presidential election on 11 March 2007. Background President Taya Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya had reigned over Mauritania since he had taken power from Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidalla in a bloodless coup d'√©tat in December 1984. Mauritania had also seen coup attempts in June 2003 and August 2004. The 2003 attempt had been led by Saleh Ould Hanenna, and the August 2004 attempt was allegedly led by army officers hailing from Hanenna's ethnic group. Motives for the coup included Taya's alignment with America and being one of only three countries in the Arab world to start formal diplomatic ties with Israel. The coup was also motivated by opposition to Taya's suppression of opposition parties and his occasional military purges. Coup details While Taya was attending the funeral of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia on 3 August 2005, members of the Presidential Guard surrounded the presidential palace and other important ministries. Shots were heard throughout the capital, clearing the streets of Nouakchott. The coup leaders also took control of state run radio and TV stations. In an official message on Mauritanian television, the coup leaders declared, \\"The armed forces and security forces have unanimously decided to put a definitive end to the totalitarian acts in the past few years of the defunct regime under which our people have suffered greatly in the last few years.\\" International reaction Domestically, the coup had widespread support from the population, with many in the capital honking their car horns in support. The African Union expressed concern and condemned all seizures of power. The Secretary-General of the UN, Kofi Annan, \\"was deeply troubled\\", stating that he wanted the dispute to be resolved peacefully. The then President of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo, denounced the coup, stating \\"the days of tolerating military governance in our sub-region or anywhere [are] long gone\\". Aftermath Taya was on the plane back to Mauritania when the coup happened, forcing him to land in Niger. He eventually made his way to Qatar, and now works as a teacher at a Qatar military school. After the coup, the African Union demanded a return to \\"constitutional order\\" in Mauritania, and suspended Mauritania's membership in the African Union. The Mauritanian military government ended after a fair presidential election was held in 2007, in which Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi was elected. Mauritania's membership in the African Union was returned following the 2007 elections. However, after it was found out that Abdallahi had opened channels of communications with Islamic hardliners thought to be associated with Al-Qaeda, and had used public funds to build a mosque in the palace, he was overthrown by a coup in 2008 led by members of the 2005 coup, resulting in Mauritania being once again suspended from the African Union.

He is so far Malta's first known philosopher, fragments of whose works are extant. His philosophical views and positions qualify him as an honourable adherent of the mediaeval humanist movement. His contribution skilfully stands as a mature reflection of the social and cultural revival of his time. Caxaro's cultural preparation and his humanistic character, together with his philosophy, entirely reflect the peculiar force, functions and needs of a Mediterranean people whose golden age had still to come, but whose mental constitution and mode of expression were readily set. The discovery of the man and his philosophy is immeasurably relevant to further recognition of the wise tenure of an ancient civilization. No portrait of Caxaro has been found. Peter Caxaro's tomb memorial at St. Dominic's Church, Rabat, Malta  Family  Peter Caxaro was born of a noble Mdina family in Malta.The following information is basically from M. Montebello, Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f‚ÄôMalta (A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, pp. 74‚Äì75. Formal and explicit permission granted by the copyright holder/s. Full bibliographical and documentary references are given below. The date of his birth is unknown, and it is doubtful that it had ever been recorded at all. He was likely born around the beginning of the 15th century. His father's name was Leo, and his mother's Zuna. It might be possible that the family was of Jewish descent and had been forced to convert to Christianity. It is known that one of Caxaro's brothers, Nicholas, was killed in 1473 following a brawl with people from Siƒ°ƒ°iewi, Malta, because of a girl he was secretly seeing.  Studies and offices  Caxaro's first studies were undertaken in Malta. Later, he went to Palermo, Sicily, to pursue them further. At the time, Palermo was a flourishing city imbued with the spirit of Renaissance humanism. There, Caxaro completed his studies and became a notary in 1438. A couple of months after his graduation, he was appointed judge at the courts of Gozo for the years 1440-1441. In 1441, he also sat as judge in the courts of Malta, and the similarly in 1475. He was judge at the civil courts in 1460-1461, 1470‚Äì1471 and 1481‚Äì1482, and judge at the ecclesiastical courts in 1473 and 1480-1481. Caxaro was also jurat at the Town Council of Mdina in 1452-1453, 1458‚Äì1459, 1461‚Äì1462, 1469‚Äì1470, 1474‚Äì1475 and 1482-1483. He was a notary or secretary to the same council in 1460 and 1468. He possessed considerable property at the northern side of Malta, and was the owner of six slaves.  Friendship with Dominicans  During all this time, Caxaro was on very good terms with the Dominican friars. These had a monastery at Rabat, Malta, very close to Mdina, Caxaro's home-town and centre of operation. The Dominicans had originally arrived in Malta around 1450, and quickly forged good friendships amongst the literary population and professional people, including academics. Towards the end of the 15th century, the Dominicans could boast of erudite friars amongst their fold, such as Peter Xara, Peter Zurki, Dominic Bartolo (who was also Pro-Inquisitor for some cases of the Inquisition in Malta) and Bartolomeus Pace. Caxaro was certainly a good friend of some of these men, both for intellectual as well as personal reasons. The fact that he designated the Dominicans as his general inheritors, or residuary legatees, in his will is proof enough of this.  Marriage attempt  Around 1463, Caxaro aspired to marrying a widow, Franca de Biglera. However, her brother, a Canon at the bishop's cathedral chapter, objected on the grounds of ‚Äúspiritual affinity‚Äù, since Caxaro's father was a godfather to Franca. Despite the fact that Caxaro did all he could to win Franca over, and also obtained the official blessing of the bishop of Malta, the marriage did not take place. To the great consternation of Caxaro, Franca changed her mind. Caxaro remained a bachelor to the end of his days.  Excommunicated  At the Town Council of Mdina Caxaro had three particular themes which he seemed to come to life about: the welfare and maintenance of his hometown Mdina, the education of the common people, and the accountability of civil servants. In 1480, Caxaro took an active and bold part in an issue which involved the bishop of Malta, who was suspected of corruption. Caxaro was vehement against such corruption, and vigorous in his demand for an immediate remedy. In June 1480, as an act of retaliation, the bishop excommunicated him, an action which was considered immensely serious in those days. Nevertheless, Caxaro was unyielding in his opposition and demands. Consequently, the bishop interdicted him. However, Caxaro was nonetheless undaunted. The issue lingered on until the first half of the following year, when the bishop had to accede to Caxaro's and the Town Council's demands. Accordingly, the excommunication and the interdict were removed. Caxaro's determination and resolve in the matter were highly praised.  Death  On August 12, 1485, Caxaro drew up his will, and died a few days later. The precise date of his death is still not known with any certainty. All his possession went to the Dominican friars. It is not known where he was initially buried. However, later, as he had it willed, his remains were laid to rest in one of the newly built chapels of the church of St. Dominic at Rabat, Malta. The chapel had been actually constructed at Caxaro's expense, and dedicated to Our Lady of Divine Help. A memorial was unveiled within the same chapel over Caxaro's tomb on September 30, 1992.  Caxaro's cultural formation  = Unveiled = Peter Caxaro was virtually unknownThe information contained in this section is basically from M. Montebello, Pietru Caxaru u l-Kantilena Tieghu (Peter Caxaro and his ‚ÄòCantilena‚Äô), Malta, 1992, pp. 15‚Äì38. Formal and explicit permission obtained from the copyright holder/s. until he was made famous in 1968 by the publication of his Cantilena by the Dominican Mikiel Fsadni and Godfrey Wettinger.Wettinger and Fsadni, 1968. It was Fsadni who discovered the Cantilena on September 22, 1966, at the back of the third page from the last in the first of Reverend Brandan Caxaro's notarial registers (1533‚Äì1536), currently numbered R175, in the Notarial Archives, Valletta.M. Montebello, ‚ÄòWho really discovered the Cantilena?‚Äô, Culture and Entertainment, supplement with The Sunday Times of Malta, 14 June, p. 1; P. Xuereb, ‚ÄòThe Cantilena‚Äô, Sunday Times of Malta, 21 June, p. 25; J. Vella, ‚ÄòWho really discovered the Cantilena?‚Äô, Sunday Times of Malta, 21 June, p. 25. Caxaro's work was actually transcribed by Rev. Brandan himself in its original Maltese version. The discovery was encountered with enthusiasm within scholarship circles since it had eventually given Maltese literature its greatest boost for a very long time.M.V.S., 1968: 39. It had taken the authors about two years before they were able to present Caxaro's Cantilena to the general public.Cf. Wettinger, 1977: 88f. The authenticity of Caxaro's work is undoubtable,Serracino-Inglott, 1968: 11. and so is Brandan's transcription. The discoverers themselves, both reliable historical researchers,Cf. Wettinger, 1977: 93. carefully examined the document and found that it could not reveal any suspicious feature.Ibid.: 89f. It was next to impossible for the document to have been faked so well that no sign of its faking remained. Up till 1968, modern scholarly references to Peter Caxaro had been few. The first known to have referred to him was the Dominican Paul Galea in his history of the Dominicans at Rabat, Malta, published in 1949.Galea, 1949: 62f. Further data was produced by Michael Fsadni O.P. in 1965, also attempting his hand at a similar history.Fsadni, 1965: 53f.; cf. also M. Fsadni, Il-Madonna tal-Ghar: Il-Knisja, il-Kunvent u s-Santwarju, Malta 1980: 24f. Both friars based their information on a common source; namely, on the Descrittione delli Tre Conventi che l‚ÄôOrdine dei Predicatori tiene nell‚ÄôIsola di Malta, I, 1, by Francesco Maria Azzopardo O.P., written about 1676.Archives of the Dominicans, Rabat, Malta: Ms. 86. Mention of Caxaro had also been made in a work preceding Azzopardo's by approximately three decades. This had been by Giovanni Francesco Abela's 1647 publication entitled (in short) Della Descrittione di Malta.Cf. infra. = The man = Introducing his transcription of the composition, Rev. Brandan - a member of the Society of True Christians - indicated its author as a \\"philosopher, poet and orator\\".Prol., vv. 2f.; Wettinger and Fsadni, 1968: 36; ibid., 1983: 47. On examination, it is positively held that Caxaro's original version was in the Maltese tongue, and that Rev. Brandan transcribed it as faithfully as possible as he recalled it.Wettinger and Fsadni, 1968: 12f.; ibid., 1983: 47. The composition proves that Caxaro's qualification as a philosopher, poet and orator is fully justified since its construction is professionally accomplished.Mallia, 1970: 120. He certainly was a man of learning. Lately, a few proposals have been made which held that the said composition, in partCassola, 1986: 120. or as a whole,Kabazi, 1990: 42. does not have Peter Caxaro as its author. It has been said that the poem is none other than Rev. Brandan's innocent transcription in Latin characters of a Megrebian or Andalusian qasida.Ibid. The proponent unscientifically based his suppositions, as he himself said, on an ‚Äúextrasensorial impression‚Äù. Thus the author hastily concluded that the qualifications attributed to Caxaro by Rev. Brandan are spurious.Ibid.: 45. The truth, however, seems to be otherwise. Caxaro's competence as a poetic writer, apart from his philosophic and oratorical skills, is highly estimable. He seems to qualifyMallia, 1970: 123. as a phonetic master, as well as one having control of classical rhetoric techniques. He has tact in expressing his veiled poetic thought in striking and tempting allusions. In other words, Caxaro is a forceful writer,Xuereb, 1971: 16. possessing clarity of thought, and is confident in handling of style.Ibid.: 16f. The Cantilena is a piece of fine literature; the work of dextrous mastership.Wettinger and Fsadni, 1983: 43f. It shows a very particular formal attention, and an uncommon capability of stylistic invention in its structure.Brincat, 1986: 16f. It must be noticed, however, that Giovanni Francesco Abela, in his Descrittione of 1647,Cf. infra. did not include Caxaro in his list of some forty-six Houmini di Malta per varie guise d‚Äôeccellenza celebri, e famosi,Pp. 548-573. of which not all are that illustrious. Abela could have mentioned Caxaro's philosophic, poetic or oratorical skills, if anything. This may suggest that Caxaro's aptitudes were somewhat concealed. The known sources of Caxaro's biographical data are few, namely four,Cf. Wettinger and Fsadni, 1968: 15-22; and ibid., 1983: 20-27. the State Archives of Palermo, Sicily (Protocollo del Regno, mainly vol. 34), the National Library of Malta (Universitas, 11), the Archives of the Dominicans, Rabat (Ms. 321, Giuliana Antica, I), and Della Descrittione di Malta Isola nel Mare Siciliano con le sue Antichit√†, ed altre Notitie of Giovanni Francesco Abela, printed by Paolo Bonecota, Malta, in 1647 (passim). The first known date regarding Caxaro is April 1, 1438, when he set for the examination to be given the warrant of public notary of Malta and Gozo by the competent authorities in Palermo, Sicily.Wettinger and Fsadni, 1983: 21, n. 67. In those times, Malta and its dependencies formed part of the Kingdom of Aragon. This means that Caxaro had spent some time in Palermo, a city then imbued with humanism.It is not excluded that Caxaro studied abroad either before or/and after this date. Next, we are informed of a series of appointments in Malta and Gozo between 1440 and 1483, a span of forty-three years. Alternatively or concurrently, at one time or another Caxaro acted as judge in the civil courts of GozoFor 1440-1441, cf. Wettinger and Fsadni, 1983: 22, n. 69. Caxaro was appointed judge in June 1438. Cf. ibid.: 22. and of Malta,For 1441, 1470-1471 and 1481-1482, cf. next note. and in the ecclesiastical cours.For 1480-1481, Wettinger and Fsadni, 1983: 22, nn. 70ff. He was further juror in Malta at the Mdina city-council,For 1452-1453, 1461-1462, 1469-1470, 1475-1476 and 1482-1483, ibid.: n. 73; and G. Wettinger, Acta Juratorum et Consilii Civitatis et Insulae Maltae, Associazione di Studi Malta-Sicilia, Palermo 1993.: passim. to which he sometimes acted as secretary.For 1460 and 1468, ibid.: 24, n. 74. Finally, the Dominicans at Rabat, Malta preserve a substantial part of his will, drawn on August 12, 1485,Wettinger and Fsadni, 1968: 53, n. 96; Fsadni, 1974: 52f.; Wettinger and Fsadni, 1983: 24f., n. 82ff. shortly before his death.Ibid., 1983: 26, n. 100. No wife or offspring are mentioned in the will. Caxaro had willed that he be buried in the Dominican newly built church at Rabat, as eventually happened.Explicit reference is made regarding the execution of Caxaro‚Äôs desire in the archives of the Dominicans at Rabat, Ms. 321, Giuliana Antica, I, f. 83v (January 28, 1497): ‚Äú‚Ä¶ in dicta Ecclesia et Cappella, in qua est defunctus dictus quondam Notarius Petrus ‚Ä¶‚Äù. in a chapel built at his own expense, dedicated to the Gloriosissima Vergine del Soccorso.Abela, Descrittione, 405. It is further known with certainty that Peter Caxaro was a native of Malta,Wettinger, 1977: 100f. born of Maltese parents,Wettinger and Fsadni, 1983: 24, nn. 75f. and lived at Mdina.Ibid.: n. 72. His date of birth is still unknown. His immobile property was considerable,Ibid.: 24f. though not exuberant. It is known that he had in his service at least six slaves.Ibid.: 25, n. 94. Apart from Caxaro's public offices and death, which is satisfactorily documented, two other personal episodes are known. The first, occurring either in 1463 or 1478,Wettinger, 1977: 105. concerns his proposed marriage to Francha di Biglera.Ibid.: 96. The whole transcript of the extant related documents are given in ibid. From the court proceedings we know that Caxaro's father had frequently visited Catalonia (specifically Barcelona and Valencia).Ibid. This may have some bearing on Peter's own formation. The second instance concerns the murder of Caxaro's brother, Cola, in 1473 at Siggiewi, Malta,The story was revealed in ibid., 97, but extensively dealt with in Wettinger, 1980: 70-77. which may have given a not-so-good reputation to his family. The most recent significant addition to the personal data and profile of Peter Caxaro was made by Frans Sammut in 2009.Sammut, 2009. He suggested that Caxaro came from a Jewish family that had been converted to Christianity. In support of his claim he proposed that Caxaro's Cantilena was in fact a zajal, which in Arabic refers to a song which the Jews of Spain (and Sicily) adopted and promoted.Though interesting as a suggestion, one must perhaps bear in mind that it was the very transcriber of the poem who originally called it a ‚Äúcantilenam‚Äù in the prologue to the poem itself. This was none other than a member of the Caxaro family itself. If the poem was a zijad, wouldn't he have known? = Extant fragments = Little of Caxaro's scholarship is known to exist. Much work has yet to be accomplished in this difficult field. We only possess isolated parts of his contributions, the most complete being the Cantilena, which, in itself, comes down to us through an imperfect, indirect source. That Brandan's transcriptCf. Wettinger and Fsadni, 1968: 36; Wettinger, 1977: 102f. and Wettinger and Fsadni, 1983: 47. of the Cantilena is faulty is evident from various internal traits. Furthermore, the reasons for which Brandan recalled the work, and even the manner in which he did so, is unto this day a baffling uncertainty. The cheerfulness felt by Brandan apparently seems to be doubly caused, namely by both the memory of the composition and the memory of his ancestor (with a necessary relationship of one to the other). Brandan's opening sentence of the short prologue seems to suggest that he was gladdened more by the relationship than by any of the related parts. Wettinger and Fsadni had suggested1983: 16. that it was the consolation which Brandan saw in the content of the composition that prompted him to leave us a memory of it, writing it down in one of the registers of his acts. But this is a question which must still be open to discussion. The first to seriously suspect certain imperfections in Brandan's transcript was Joseph Brincat in 1986,Brincat, 1986: 11. suspicious of the verses which do not have any rhyme. He specifically refers here to the four lines of the refrain (vv. 7-10) and the first four lines of the second stanza (vv. 11-14). Brincat, guided by his erudition as by common sense, concludes that the quatrain which stands on its own between the two stanzas, of six verses and ten verses each respectively, is erroneously transcribed by Brandan.Ibid. Brincat very aptly provides convincing internal evidence for the error.Ibid.: 13f. Brincat's important conclusion was followed by other scholars,Cassola, 1986: 119. and to which we also subscribe here. Apart from the Cantilena, other fragments concerning Caxaro's contributions are extant, namely, a few judicial sentences passed by Caxaro at the ecclesiastical courts,Cf. at the Cathedral Museum, Mdina, Original Archives, Ms. 1. See, for instance, ff. 187vr and 19vf. and secretarial minutes taken at the Mdina town-council meetings in which Caxaro took part.Cf. Wettinger, Acta Juratorum, op. cit. See, for instance, nn. 4, 8, 10, 11, 21, etc. Both are naturally extra-philosophical in nature. The sentences, however interesting they may be, only give us an inkling into the equilibrate soberness of Caxaro. Herein, we search in vain for any of Caxaro's own original thinking, apart from the arid judicial and official terminology. The same may be said of the municipal acts. Only here the information provided regards Caxaro's context in matters which interested his town (Mdina) particularly, and the Maltese Islands in general. Caxaro's name is mentioned at least in some 267 sittings of the council between 1447 and 1485. At most of these, he had a minor say;Cf., for instance, ibid., nn. 11, 21,24, 39, etc. at other times, his share is more substantial.Cf., for instance, ibid., nn. 45, 94, 121, 124, etc. Some acts are also written in Caxaro's own hand.Cf., for instance, ibid., nn. 36, 37, 75, 97, etc. = The philosopher = Philosopher is the title attributed to Caxaro by Rev. Brandan.Wettinger and Fsadni, 1968: 15f. In the rest of the Cantilena‚Äôs prologue, which is formally in accord with the general practice of the times,Cf., Bonnici, 1990: 46. the poetic rather than the philosophical or oratorical excellences of Caxaro are emphasized.Prol., vv. 3ff. These are left in the shadow, even by modern scholars. It has been naively venturedCassola, 1968: 4. that the appellative philosopher is to be understood merely in the sense of a man of wisdom or learning (‚Äúbniedem gharef‚Äù, literally indicating a sophist rather than a philosopher). However, being a trustworthy notary in possession of a precise vocabulary (to which the rest of the prologue, at least, is witness), Rev. Brandan is to be understood in a strict sense. The hope of the discovery of corroborative material in this regard must remain enkindled. The fact that a man's philosophy is to be detected from nothing more than a fragment of his written thought, however substantial it may be, does not make novelty in the history of philosophy. Innumerable cases of the sort may be found to exist, including philosophers of a gigantic stature, such as the Miletians, or even Aristotle himself. The same is to be said regarding the poetic form of Caxaro's extant philosophy. We have similar cases with philosophers of outstanding relevance, such as the Eleatics, including Parmenides himself, the father of philosophy. However, here, with Caxaro's case, the question is slightly more complex. We do not have to do with a then out-going poetic custom in an age where prose took the precedence, as in the Greek naturalistic philosophers (of the 5th century BCE). We are in the context of (15th-century) Medieval philosophy, highly susceptible to classical literature, both Greek and Roman, but particularly to Plato and Aristotle. Here, more than anything else, the poetic form is a technique, an expressive and cognitive distinction. Some scholars today, especially those brought up in a scholastic tradition, would like to qualify a philosophic work from its systematic nature. Such a definite distinctness would have philosophers like Aristotle, Avicenna, Albertus Magnus, Aquinas, and the like, fitting like drawers. On the other hand, however, it would unwittingly exclude, if none other, Plato himself, the archetype philosopher of all time, who, unlike the scientist Aristotle, is an artist prior to being a philosopher. The Corpus Platonicum stands as evident testimony. Thus Caxaro is part of a tradition which may characteristically and properly be called platonic. The accent here would fall less on unsystemization, and more on narration, or better, on the myth-type philosophy in its technical connotation. From the formal, essential aspect, we are in the line of Plato, St. Augustine and the Medieval neo-Platonists, especially those with a humanistic formation in the early Renaissance period. This was later continued by people like Descartes, Pascal, Rousseau, Nietzsche, and the like. In general, it is a philosophical trend commencing with an ideal response, technically speaking, to Parmenides' concept of being, marked with an intense attention to the affective functions in man, to that knowledge acquired through a volitive prompting, and further manifested with an openness to flexibility. Though the will is duly valued, the intrinsic mental capabilities of man are held to be necessary, prior to the senses, in discovering the true object of knowledge, that being which is different and superior to mere sense data.  A Humanistic character  It seems to be opportune at this point to highlight two instances from Caxaro's acquaintances, namely, his father's contact with Barcelona and Valencia, and Caxaro's own connection with Palermo. = Humanist Catalonia = Catalonia, together with Aragon, became familiar with humanism before Castille.Cf. G. Fraile, Historia de la Filosofia, Madrid 1966, III: 80f. The first contact of the Catalan scholars with the movement was at its first appearance at the Pontifical court of Avignon, where Petrarch sojourned, and at the Council of Constance (1414‚Äì1418), Basle (1431) and Florence (1438‚Äì1455), as at the Neapolitan court of Alphonse V of Aragon, so- called El Magnanimo (died 1458). The Catalan movement was initiated by Juan Fernandez' efforts in the 14th century. Fernandez travelled to the East and returned with many Greek manuscripts. He later established himself as a translator, compiler and commentator of classical texts, therefore giving rise to a literary culture concerned with human interests. Fernandez was followed by other men of standing, such as Pedro de Saplana, a Dominican (14th century), Antonio Canals, Bernat Metge (c.1340-1413), Carlos de Aragon (1421‚Äì1461), nephew of King Alphonse V, and Bachiller Alfonso de la Torre (15th century). These men of letters concentrated on the works of Aristotle, Boethius, Petrarch, Boccaccio, Marcianus Capella, Pedro Campostella, and the like. They were additionally highly instrumental in animating the cultural centres of Barcelona and Valencia with the spirit of humanism. It would not be surprising that Caxaro's father, in the course of his constant voyaging between Catalonia, Sicily and Malta, like so many other tradesmen of his time, came in contact with the then prevailing environment of Spain's Mediterranean city-harbours. Here, as elsewhere, humanism was not restricted to mere cultural circles, but had become the philosophy of the people. Caxaro, apart from his father, had other members of his family, together with many of his townfolk,Cf. Abela, Descrittione: 288ff., and passim. taking part in this same commerce of goods and ideas. = Humanist Palermo = King Alphonse the Magnanimous of Aragon, asserting his seat at Naples, and set in giving additional splendour to the reign of Aragon, was successful in changing the Neapolitan court in one of Renaissance's most brilliant great centres.Fraile, op. cit.: 58. Naples and its favoured twin Palermo were visited by the most eminent of humanists from all over the Italian peninsula, Catalonia, Castile and Aragon. From the first half of the 15th century onwards, Palermo went through an enormous and impressive economic, demographic and urbanistic development,I. Peri, Restaurazione e Pacifico Stato in Sicilia 1377-1501, Rome-Bari 1988: 157-163. manifesting a substantial cultural facelift. Though the times were rather difficult due to the frequent incursions of the Turks, and the disastrous effect of epidemics and other diseases,Ibid.: 203f. the enthusiasts of the human√¶ litter√¶ were great in number. Up to Caxaro's visit to Palermo many native men familiar with the studia humanitatisIbid.: 143ff. made a name for themselves and for their town, scholars like Giovanni Aurispa and Giovanni Marrasio. As in the case of Catalonia, the spirit of humanism was imported to Sicily from Northern Italy where large numbers of Palemitans went to study.C. De Seta and L. Di Mano, Palermo, Palermo 1988: 55. Prior to 1445, when the Studio di Catania was established,Peri, op. cit.: 149f. it was Palermo which attracted the largest number of law students. These were centres where the classical texts were circulated mainly in manuscript form.It was only later, at the end of the 15th century, that printed books came in vogue. Ibid.: 152. In those days, the large number of intellectuals and law students considered the juridical culture as instrumental in acquiring a worthy social standing.A. Guiffride, ‚ÄúLu quartieri di lu Cassaru‚Äù, Note sul quartiere del Cassaro a Palermo nella prima met√† del secolo XVI, in M√©langes de l'√âcole fran√ßaise de Rome, Serie Moyen Ages ‚Äì Temps Modernes, LXXXIII, 1971, 2, 454f., quoted in De Seta and Di Mano, op. cit.: 55f. The professional state, especially the juridical, became an integral part of the refreshed milieu of the times at Palermo. Moreover, while the use of the vulgar tongues became established as a practised norm,Peri, op. cit.: 152. the so-called cultura del decoro of the humanists became, more than restricted to cultural circles, a quality of life.Ibid.: 163. Slowly it became the diffused, general mentality of the educated Palermitans.De Seta and Di Mano, op. cit.: 55. During his visit to Palermo the young Caxaro himself must have been extremely impressed by the evident restoration and construction of Palermo's edifices, both within and without the walls, according to the tastes of the time. The whole city was caught in a rediscovered renovation, manifesting a strong concern for the quality of life. The prevailing humanism brought to the fore a movement of the spirit, each time aesthetic, philosophic, scientific and religious,Phillippart, Revue de Synthese, X: 107. sharpening the notion of beauty, and brightening the relationship to nature (and naturalism). Caxaro's sojourn at Palermo in 1438 must have recalled to him King Alphonse's stop in Malta, amidst great pomp and exultation, five years earlier.Abela, Descrittione, 424. The Magnanimous, personifying the spirit of the time, entered Mdina, Caxaro's town-fortress, ‚Äúcon quelle magiori dimostrationi di giubilo, & applauso, che potevan originarsi da affetto sincero di devoti, e riverenti Vassalli verso il loro Signore‚Äù.Ibid. = The spirit of mediaeval humanism = In order to comprehend better Caxaro's philosophy we cannot do less than grasp the spirit of humanism in his age. The heart of the Mediaeval humanists, as distinct from that of the 14th century Mediaeval masters, and from the exponents of the 16th century Renaissance, was the retrieval and imitation of the beauty of ancient letters. This had nothing of any anti- Christian sentiment but definitely emphasized naturalism enormously. The imitation of the customs of pagan antiquity came later.Cf. Fraile, op. cit.: 24f. The beginning of humanism coincided with a number of other occurrences.Cf. ibid.: 43. In the first place, the Eastern Schism, a critical moment in the Catholic Church which weakened the papacy. Next, a marked ignorance of the clergy and a relaxation of discipline. Thirdly, the corruption of the customs of the high classes. And finally, the decadence of Scholasticism. The forerunners of humanism imprinted their views with surprising power. The works of Brunetto Latini (1230‚Äì1291), Dante Alighieri (1265‚Äì1321), Francesco Petrarca (1304‚Äì1374) and Giovanni Boccaccio (1313‚Äì1375) became the daily bread of the humanists. All of these extensively admired classical antiquity, idealising its splendour and richness, and dreaming of an ideal society equivalent to that apparently gorgeous achievement. Ironically (maybe), it was the melancholic and pessimistic cleric Petrarca who exerted the greatest influence on the humanists,Harvey, ed., English Literature, Oxford 1984: 637. advocating, like Socrates, the true wisdom in the knowledge of self, and true humility as the path to the secrets of life. His adherence to Plato and his fierce attacks on Scholasticism deeply impressed his posteriors. It was Petrarca, eventually, who supplied the humanist movement with its battle-cries: Rinascere! Rifiorire! Rivivere! Ritrovare! ‚Äï stressing the ri more than anything else. The humanist rebirth was felt in the whole of Western Europe, especially in the Italian peninsula, France, England, the Netherlands, Germany and Spain.Cf. Fraile, op. cit.: 46-94. Being the cultural climax of all that has been done in the Middle Ages, the humanist wave of erudition superbly retrieved the Latin, Greek and Christian classical literature, with its proper techniques, methods, forms and tastes.Cf. ibid.: 33-46. It developed sciences, such as philology, palaeography, epigraphy, archaeology, numismatics, textual criticism and literary criticism, geography and history. It also gave rise to the printing press, the libraries, to new universities, paternities and literary associations, such as the renowned Academic Platonica of Marsilio Ficino (1433‚Äì1499). In other words, a true renaissance with its proper philosophy which recognises the value and dignity of man and makes him, as Protagoras would have it, the ‚Äúmeasure of all things‚Äù, somehow taking human nature, its limits and delimits, together with its interests, as it main theme.Abbagnano, ‚ÄúHumanism‚Äù, Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Edwards Ed., New York 1972: 4, 69f.

Wettinger and Fsadni, 1968: 40; Serracino-Inglott, 1968: 11 and G.C.P., 1969: 28. have given ample food for thought. In general, the comments regarded the embarrassing inconsistencies which exist in the extant copy of the Cantilena. The literary value of Caxaro's work, and its standing in the Maltese literary tradition, has likewise been embellished from the historical literary analyses‚Äô point of view.On the new date for Maltese literature, cf.

More interesting comments had been advanced from the perspective of literary criticism.On rules for analysis, cf.

Buttigieg, 1968: 6. However, much work has to be done in this field, especially by scholars with professional standing on mediaeval Arabic, Spanish and Sicilian idioms, dialects and poetic forms. Due to the Cantilena‚Äôs uniqueness interesting results have been put forward by historical linguistics,On the relation between Maltese and the Cantilena, cf. Cowan, 1975: 5f., 10 and Aquilina, 1984: 12; on historical linguistics‚Äô method and technique, cf. Cowan, 1975: 4f. and Wettinger, 1977: 94 and Bin-Bovingdon, 1978: 106f. emphasising the drastic changes in the Maltese language over a span of four centuries. What interests us here, however, is not the Cantilena‚Äôs literary value as much as its philosophical content. Before proceeding further, it would be opportune to give the transliteration of the Cantilena:Cf. Wettinger and Fsadni, 1983: 47. :: Xideu il cada ye gireni tale nichadithicum :: Mensab fil gueri uele nisab fo homorcom 2 :: Calb mehandihe chakim soltan ui le mule :: Bir imgamic rimitine betiragin mecsule 4 :: fen hayran al garca nenzel fi tirag minzeli :: Nitila vy nargia ninzil deyem fil-bachar il hali 6 ::: [Omission]The modifications of Brincat in Brincat, 1986 are taken in full consideration, i.e., omitting the following from the original Ms.: 7 Huakit hi mirammiti lili zimen nibni / 8 Mectatilix mihallimin me chitali tafal morchi / 9 fen timayt insib il gebel sib tafal morchi / 10 vackit hi mirammiti. :: Huakit hy mirammiti Nizlit hi li sisen :: Mectatilix il mihallimin ma kitatili li gebel 8(12) :: fen tumayt insib il gebel sib tafal morchi :: Huakit thi mirammiti lili zimen nibni 10(14) :: Huec ucakit hi mirammiti vargia ibnie :: biddilihe inte il miken illi yeutihe 12(16) :: Min ibidill il miken ibidil il vintura :: halex liradi ‚Äòal col xebir sura 14(18) :: hemme ard bayda v hemme ard seude et hamyra :: Hactar min hedaun heme tred minne tamarra 16(20) Paraphrased in English:Cf. Wettinger and Fsadni, 1968: 38 and ibid., 1983: 44. For further paraphrasing of the Cantilena, cf. Wettinger and Fsadni, 1968: 41; Cassola, 1968: 41; Vassallo, 1968: 585f. (in Maltese); Xuereb, 1971: 19 (in English); Brincat, 1986: 21 (in Italian); Cohen and Vanhove, 1986: 200 (in French).http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/The%20Arabs%20in%20Malta/1975Approaches%20to%20medieval%20Malta%20Luttrell.pdf p. 66-7. :: The recital of misfortune, O my neighbours, come I‚Äôll tell you :: Such as has not been found in the past, nor in your lifetime. :: A heart ungoverned, kingless, and lordless :: Has thrown me into a deep well with steps that stop short; :: Where, desiring to drown, I descend by the steps of my downfall; :: Rising and falling always in the stormy sea. :: My house has fallen! It has pushed the foundations. :: The workmen did not trespass, the rock gave way. :: Where I had hoped to find rock, I found loose clay. :: The house I had long been building has collapsed. :: And that‚Äôs how my house fell!

The publishers themselves found it ‚Äúterribly difficult and absolutely daunting‚Äù.Wettinger, 1977: 92f. The interpreter, it had been said,Serracino-Inglott, 1968: 11. had to be a philologist, a Maltese, one in possession of Arabic, familiar with the history of Malta, and well informed on the author of the composition. It must be admitted that a foreigner, even if expert in this field of study, but unfamiliar to a Maltese way of thinking, will find the text difficult and obscure.Cf. Cohen and Vanhove, 1986: 193. The main idea of the text, the so- called ‚Äúphysical interpretation‚Äù,Bin-Bovingdon, 1978: 117. is simple enough. An uncontrollable person had been responsible for the collapse of a building which the author considered to be his.Wettinger and Fsadni, 1968: 39 and ibid., 1983: 43. In other words, he had misjudged the situation. The theme seems to follow a definite scheme, namely, an apparently simple one:Bonnici, 1990: 46. an invocation (vv. 1-2), the narration of an unhappy love event and the lyric I's situation thereby (vv. 3-6), its delusion (vv. 7-10, 11-14), and finally its attempt to reverse the misfortune (vv. 15-20). It is a scheme which in its content resembles the general classical Semitic (specifically Arabic) qasida pattern.Fenech, 1985: 7 and 12; Cachia (1969: 141) had misjudged the said general purposrt as unarabic. A point of curiosity might be interesting here. As from the beginning of 1450,Cf. Wettinger, Acta, op. cit.: 4. the Mdina town-council had been discussing the precarious state of the town walls (the mirammerii) of Mdina. In March of that same year,Cf. ibid.: 10. the Augustinian Matteo di Malta had been commissioned as the town-council's ambassador to lead the talks with the viceroy on the question so as to provide funds for their urgent restoration. Little, if any, progress seems to have been made on the matter, until at the beginning of 1454Cf. ibid.: 39. an internal tower of the castle at mdina collapsed. So as to take immediate action and prevent further immanent collapse of the walls, at the town-council sitting of January 11Cf. ibid. Peter Caxaro, acting as secretary, spoke in favour of an urgent collecta (which was later effected), with the approval of the whole house. Furthermore, on May 24,Cf. ibid.: 43. Nicholas Caxaro, Peter's brother, had been appointed by the council as supramarammerius to supervise the restoration of the walls. On that occasion, Peter Caxaro had highly praised the decision taken. Strictly by way of speculation, it seems interesting to associate the Cantilena‚Äôs mirammiti to Mdina‚Äôs marammerii (being the same term). What is said in the Cantilena‚Äôs refrain might be identified to the disastrous collapse of part of Mdina's walls in 1454. The Cantilena might have been inspired from that serious occasion, which was the effect of a general negligence. Supposing that the Cantilena had been sung to some of those noblemen at the town-council who were collaborators of Caxaro (as is possible), such speculation might hold some water. Apart from the immediate and superficial message, we obviously have a more profound and veiled communication. The overall drift of this so-called ‚Äúmetaphysical interpretation‚Äù,Bin-Bovingdon, 1978: 117f. has been seen to be the ruin of the author's project, either concerning his career or a love affair.Wettinger and Fsadni, 1968: 39 and Wettinger, 1977: 93. The general melancholic tone of the composition did not pass unnoticed,Cachia, 1968: 1. though it had been recognised that the final note sounded the victory of hope over desperation; the building anew over the ruins of unfulfilled dreams or ambitions.Cf. P.D.M., 1968: 11. In 1977 Wettinger categorically denied that the murder of Caxaro's brother had any relevance to the theme of the Cantilena.Wettinger, 1977: 97. On the other hand, he proposed that it may have to do with Caxaro's marriage proposal which apparently went up in smoke.Ibid, 95ff. The suggestion had been confirmed jointly by Wettinger and Fsadni in 1983.Wettinger and Fsadni, 1983: 43f. Though presumably well calculated, it would seem that the comments put forward so far reveal little depth, hinging on to a restricted inspection of the matter. This may have somewhat betrayed Caxaro's philosophic prowess.For such a rash conclusion, cf. Xuereb, 1968: 24. Some have audaciously stated that the composition has no depth of feeling at all.Aquilina, 1984: 12. Others have indeed valued its content highly,Bonavia, 1968: 4. wisely noting that the subject is entirely profane (as opposed to the sacred), and moreover sheds light on the concrete versus abstract thinking of the populace (a feature common amongst Mediterranean peoples unto this day); reality against illusion.Bin-Bovingdon, 1978: 118. What mostly concerns us here is Caxaro's idiosyncrasy in order to comprehend the entire complexity of his thought as it appears synthetically in the text. His cognitive peculiarities as well as his cultural shared-interests jointly constitute his marked philosophical views and positions. = The text = An idiosyncratic analysis of the Cantilena implies the minute examination of its constitution, particularly of the ideas expressed therein.

The structure seems to be based on four moments, namely: : (1) the true rock and the apparent rock (i.e., the clay) : (2) on which the foundations were built : (3) by the workmen : (4) for the erection of the house The blame for the collapse of the house is given to none of the moments save the appearance of something real, namely, of the rock (i.e., the clay).

The suggested propositions can neither be exhaustive nor comprehensive but may simply aid our understanding of Caxaro's philosophical positions. = The common tongue = In the first place it is never enough to emphasise the use of the (Maltese) vulgar idiom by Caxaro. This marked a qualitative leap which resulted from a humanistic formation. The option to express himself with masterly skill while positively valuing highly the language of the people, as opposed to the Latin and Sicilian idioms of the cultured class, indicates real quality on the part of Caxaro. Not only is it a mere choice of tongue but, over and above, it is the adherence to a set mentality peculiar to a geographic territory. It also shows the worth given to a local culture and heritage, considering it capable of standing on its own two feet on an equal par with that of other neighbouring countries. The use of the Maltese vulgar tongue is not a call for independent rule but an affirmation of a native identity characteristic of a people. = Humankind at the centre = Similarly important is the profane theme and nature of Caxaro's composition. This marks a further sign of Caxaro's humanistic character. The Cantilena is not a-religious or anti-Christian but it decidedly does not belong to what is sacred, religious or biblical. It is definitely not irreverent or blasphemous but it characteristically considers life, persons and their surroundings from a human standing. The theme dwells on the qualities distinctive of the human nature, such faculties which affirm the astonishing skills of humans and their intrinsic power to transcend the otherwise despairing limitations of their essential characters. Caxaro's composition in fact shows a trustworthy reliance on the spiritual, or better, immaterial possibilities of humans. The Cantilena can thus rightly be considered a profession of faith in humankind. Such a belief reverts our attention to the classical humanism of the Sophists and of Socrates himself, a school which immensely inspired early Renaissance philosophy. We note here the surpassing of the merely naturalistic mentality of the classics, placing humans at the centre of serious consideration. The classical excellence of proposing natural solutions to age-old problems, over and above the former religious tentative answers, must not be discarded from the context. = The sphere of reality = The concreteness of Caxaro's reflections stands out loud and clear against any theoretical speculation. The arid, scholastic, professional terminology and mental structure is completely done away with. The practical existential perspective to life and reality is preferred. This may be considered typically Maltese in nature or at least Mediterranean where an acute common sense is noticeable in everyday dealings. Caxaro's inclination towards action rather than speculation, subordinating (though not eliminating) the latter to the former reveals his inclination towards the platonic school and away from Aristotelico-Scholastic categories of thought. This, indeed, marks yet another asset to his humanistic character; a trait so strongly felt in the movement. = Myth vs. Logos = Narration in Caxaro, as elsewhere, does not imply shallowness. Nor does it hint at an incapability to express oneself otherwise, namely, in arbitrary (professional) terms. Narration must be considered also as a scientific genre of expression. In fact, it is a traditional technique rich in history where sophistication is purposely ignored, choosing a more fluid, free and inclusive mode of communication. Caxaro's composition, following the line of Plato's own professional preferences, is shrouded in a linguistic and conceptual veil so as to incite us to an active surmise. Its very narrative construction prompts our latent curiosity to probe the hidden meaning under the apparently shallow surface. As opposed to a technical (‚ÄúAristotelico-Scholastic‚Äù) form, which is almost always intrinsically rigid and lineated, even if more immediate and direct, Caxaro's philosophy is given under the disguise of a narration which has a reality of its own. While Caxaro himself synthetically states his concepts, especially as regards the unpleasantness of illusion, he prefers to express himself under ‚Äúdeceptive‚Äù clothing. The objective nature of his philosophy is thus skilfully guarded behind a screen through which a mere sensuous perception fails to penetrate. = Allegory vs. Parable = Caxaro's narration cannot be taken as a puerile typification of moral or spiritual relations. It is futile to search for strict correspondence between each and every figure he uses and concrete occurrences in life, his or any other. It is on these grounds that the ‚Äúmarriage proposal‚Äù interpretation must not be taken seriously, for it despoils Caxaro's composition from its abounding intrinsic qualities. Correspondences do exist indeed in the Cantilena between the various symbolisms which Caxaro harmoniously employs. In truth, he does not simply portray an image for the mere artificial imitation of its external form but moreover dwells on the wealthy analogous qualities of the theory of symbols so widely used in the Middle Ages. At this point it is essential to note that the use of allegory in Caxaro's Cantilena, in accordance with Mediaeval usage, adheres to a subject under the semblance of narrative suggesting similar characteristics. In all probability, Caxaro may not be referring to one single case but to a life-situation in general. The use of an allegory technically functions as a stimulation to further reflection; an openness to the mystery and riddle of life. = Truth vs. Appearance = This is an important theme in the Cantilena, maybe carrying the greatest consequence for the whole composition. ‚ÄúFen tumayt insib il gebel sib tafal morchi‚Äù (‚ÄúWhere I hoped to find rock I found soft clay‚Äù, v. 13{19}) gives us the hint. This may well be the key to the composition's enigma. We have here a juxtaposition of an apparent truth (a pseudo-truth) and the truth itself. In its most general terms this is a metaphysical problem. It marks human's encounter with a reality which is in itself concealed and garbed with the immediate consciousness and evidence of the sensible. Caxaro eventually contrasts the phenomenal to the noumenical reality, that is, the object of the senses, to which he was attracted in the first place, and the object of the intellect, which he discovered posteriorly. Caxaro's emphasis, however, and this is his proper characteristic in this sphere, is less on the intuitive function of humans and more on experiential undergoing. The senses are the media with which the real is arrived at. The theme is an echo of Plato's most fundamental problematic. Plato opposes appearance to the truth (reality), to which he identifies life. To the former he identifies existence. Appearance stops at the level of things which are not of any prime importance save as a vehicle of thought. A general superficiality in life at large is a result of constant and persisting shallowness in all aspects of humans‚Äô being. The ability, on the other hand, to go to the heart of things, to the truth of reality, to life itself, would make this appearance ineffective. = Metaphysics = Caxaro's ontological and epistemological philosophy, together with his psychology, commences with the concrete experience of defeat and impotency (see v. 11{15}). It is not a momentary despondency but rather a state of being. It is the consciousness of humans helplessly succumbing to a reality which overshadows them. From the reflection of this mode of existence determined by circumstances there arises in Caxaro the humanistic trigger to break out of the humiliating condition (diametrically opposed to the humanizing condition) by a rediscovery of the intrinsic spiritual power within humans themselves. ‚ÄúVargia ibnie‚Äù (‚Äúand build it up again‚Äù, v. 11{15}) recalls Petrarca's call for rebirth; a reblooming out of the dust. This marks an essential moment in the rekindled faith and confidence in oneself to overcome helplessness and inertia. Action now takes the fore (see v. 12{16}). The place of the distorted vision of reality, of the illusory appearance which ruins human living, is to be taken by a fresh renewed conception and introspection. We have here the (spiritual) decision, founded on knowledge, to drastically and decidedly opt for a higher quality of life, namely by the choice of the truth, however troublesome, instead of pseudo-truth (that is, presumed being). Similarly, being a state of living, this is an option in favour of science, religion, the Church, the State, and the like. Over and above, it is an option in favour of individual personality. All of this is in opposition to pseudo- science, -religion, -Church, -State, and pseudo-personality. Thus humans are indeed vulnerable and susceptible to the riddle of existence (see vv. 13-14{17-18}). It is their sense of real ascertainment, their capability of applying their judging faculties with right measure (see vv. 15-16{19-20}), that gives them the right sense of direction. = Logic = No minute examination of Caxaro's logic as presented in vv. 7-10{11-14}. Caxaro's formal logic seems to be characteristic of his times, showing a notable departure from the former scholastic logic.Cf. I. Thomas, ‚ÄúInterregnum‚Äù, Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Edwards Ed., op. cit., 4, 534f. His syllogism is simple. It avoids complicated compounds. It is based on mental associations of necessary and contingent relationships. The first four propositions seem to form two pairs of conditional statements, called ‚Äúconsequential‚Äù by the mediaevalists, with true status for both the ‚Äúantecedents‚Äù and the ‚Äúconsequents‚Äù. The remaining four follow from the former propositions and seem to be constructed on the first inferential schemata of traditional logic. = Causation = Caxaro seems to have in mind notions other than the archaic Aristotelian concepts of cause. The whole of vv. 3-4 recall one of the motive forces which Empedocles called ‚ÄúStrife‚Äù, accounting for the dissolution or decay of the other force, ‚ÄúLove‚Äù, which is the principle of generation. Furthermore, Plato's own concept of cause seems to play an additional part. The forms, or formal causes, of things are proposed by Plato to give account for the changes in the world. It seems that Caxaro, especially in v. 3, touches upon this idea. In general, the mediaeval humanists consistently attempted to avow Aristotle's concepts whenever possible, including those of cause. However, his influence was never completely cancelled. Consequently, they tried to adhere to other theories of causation, especially those, as Caxaro's lines seem to demonstrate, which do not admit of any necessary consequence, if not with further qualifications. = Communication = The triad at the head of the Cantilena is part of the general narrative theory of language. It rests on two legs, namely, Caxaro's examined life, a tenet proceeding from Socrates and Plato up to Petrarch, and further on the transmission of that experience. This is opposed to the teaching of an otherwise abstract theory, somewhat confirming a superiority of the subject of communication over the object of that communication. A narration of an undergone experience strictly speaking does not rest on the cognitive understanding of the addressee but on his affective capabilities, which to some degree are universal. In other words, it calls for sympathy of sentiments. Caxaro's narration, in which he takes a clear philosophical position, retracts from being an instruction, whether it moral or dogmatic. The narration qualifies as an announcement of the discovery of an all- important immaterial world, over and above mere semblances. = Symbolism = In this context one can easily comprehend the nature of the language used by Caxaro: an expressive mode which, in accordance with his general philosophy, is intrinsically unconfined and porous. It is likewise based on a theory of correspondences. Caxaro does not seem to employ images in an unrelated (or extrinsically related) aloof manner. He does not merely appropriate their external form in some way. Caxaro aptly creates a harmony of nuances amongst the symbols he uses, taking advantage of their mutual agreeability. Moreover, he presents them in an analogous relationship with his world of being through the understanding of that world as an indissoluble unity. Caxaro's symbols, like those of the Megalithics in Malta and the posteriors Eleatics in Greece, are neither simple nor artificial. They do not point to the author's identification to the images qua images. Caxaro's peculiar material expression presupposes a prior cosmic spiritual relationship between all matter. This is a philosophy very proper to the mediaeval philosophers, especially those of the so-called Platonic school. Unfortunately, here we must sadly restrain myself from going into each and every symbolic implication of the Cantilena. The qualities of the symbolism of the heart (calb, v. 3), the well (bir, v. 4), the steps (‚Ä¶tiragin and tirag, vv. 4 and 5 respectively), the water (bachar, v. 6), the house (miramm{a}‚Ä¶, vv. 7{11}, 10{14} and 11{15}), the foundations (sisen, v. 7{11}), the rock (gebel, vv. 8{12} and 9{13}), the land (miken, vv. 12{16} and 13{17}; ‚Ä¶rad‚Ä¶ and ard, vv. 14{18} and 15{19}), and the colours (bayda, white; seude, black; hamyra, red, v. 15{19}), are all proportional to other qualities in humans themselves, who are also part of a coherent, interconnected reality. Each symbol used by Caxaro is given a qualification, thus modifying their absoluteness. At the same time he recognises their contingent being in relation to humans themselves. The heart is qualified with ‚Äúmehandihe chakim soltan ui le mule‚Äù (‚Äúungoverned, kingless and lordless‚Äù, v. 3). The well with ‚Äúimgamic‚Äù (‚Äúbottomless‚Äù, v. 4). The steps with ‚Äúmecsule‚Äù and ‚Äúmizeli‚Äù (‚Äústop short‚Äù and ‚Äúdownfall‚Äù respectively, v. 4). The water with ‚Äúil hali‚Äù (‚Äústormy‚Äù or ‚Äúdeep‚Äù, v. 6). The house with ‚Äúlili zimen nibni‚Äù (‚ÄúI had long been building‚Äù, v. 10{14}). The rest of the symbolisms follow an indirect qualification. The foundations with ‚Äútafal morchi‚Äù (‚Äúsoft clay‚Äù, v. 9{13}). The rock with ‚Äúkitatili‚Äù (‚Äúgave way‚Äù, v. 8{12}). The land with ‚Äúvintura‚Äù and ‚Äúsura‚Äù (‚Äúfortune‚Äù and ‚Äúdifference‚Äù, vv. 13{17} and 14{18} respectively). The colours with ‚Äúard‚Äù (‚Äúland‚Äù) itself (v. 15{19}). Of course, the qualification are essential as the correspondences themselves, and also as much as the logical associations of vv. 7(11) to 10(12), where symbolism has a major role.

Grove Press) Exit the King () is an absurdist drama by Eug√®ne Ionesco that premiered in 1962. It is the third in Ionesco's \\"Berenger Cycle\\", preceded by The Killer (1958) and Rhinoc√©ros (1959), and followed by A Stroll in the Air (1963). Plot In the other plays of the \\"Berenger Cycle\\", Berenger appears as a depressed and insecure everyman who is prone to sentimentality. In Exit the King, he is the solipsistic and belligerent King Berenger the First who was apparently at one point able to command nature and force others to obey his will. According to his first wife he is over four hundred years old. He is informed early in the play that he is dying, and the kingdom is likewise crumbling around him. He has lost the power to control his surroundings and is slowly losing his physical capabilities as well. Through much of the play, he is in denial of his death and refuses to give up power. Berenger's first wife, Marguerite, along with the Doctor, tries to make Berenger face the reality of his impending death. Berenger's second wife, Marie, sympathetically attempts to keep Berenger from the pain of knowing his death is imminent. The king lapses into Berenger's normal sentimentality and eventually accepts that he is going to die. The characters disappear one by one, eventually leaving the king, now speechless, alone with Marguerite who prepares him for the end.She says \\"It was a lot of fuss about nothing, wasn‚Äôt it?\\" Marguerite and then the king disappear into darkness as the play ends.  Analysis  Exit the King is unusual among Ionesco's works in that the plot is linear and focuses on depletion rather than accumulation. Often in Ionesco's plays, the stage is filled with more and more objects or characters; in Rhinoceros, for example, there are gradually more and more rhinoceroses. In this play, however, the kingdom and all the characters slowly disappear. Likewise, the language is generally more straight forward and comprehensible, eschewing Ionesco's tendency toward abundant clich√©s and nonsense. Ionesco told Claude Bonnefoy in a 1966 interview that Exit the King did not \\"originate in a dream\\" as many of his plays did, but was \\"much more consciously composed. People immediately said: 'Oh! He‚Äôs given up the avant-garde, he‚Äôs turning classical!' It wasn‚Äôt a question of choosing between classicism and the avant- garde. I had quite simply written in a different style because I was on a different level of consciousness\\". Ionesco also said the play was composed while he was ill and frightened of death. He was inspired partly by a childhood obsession with death in which Ionesco believed one could simply avoid being sick and live forever. Exit the King was written to be a kind of lesson in death: \\"I told myself that one could learn to die, that I could learn to die, that one can also help other people to die. This seems to me to be the most important thing we can do, since we‚Äôre all of us dying men who refuse to die. This play is an attempt at an apprenticeship in dying\\".Bonnefoy, Claude. Conversations with Ionesco. Trans. Jan Dawson. New York: Hold, Rinehart and Winston, 1971. 78‚Äì79. According to religious historian Mircea Eliade, the play \\"cannot be fully understood if one does not know the Tibetan Book of the Dead and the Upanishads\\"Occultism, Witchcraft and Cultural Fashions: Essays in Comparative Religions, University of Chicago Press, 1976, pp1-2. Les Essif in Empty Figure on an Empty Stage points out that Exit the King comes closest of all Ionesco's plays to the paradigm of absurdism established by Samuel Beckett. Though Beckett and Ionesco are commonly grouped together under the name \\"Theatre of the Absurd\\" because of their shared themes of alienation and the difficulty of communication, Beckett's plays generally present a stripped down, minimalist tableau whereas Ionesco presents a proliferation of chaos. According to Essif, Exit the King is Ionesco's most Beckettian play: \\"The image of an exterior world fades in cadence with the protagonist‚Äôs surrender to the interiority of his consciousness, that is, with the increasing intensification of his inward- turning. The vertical axis of the subjective abyss runs counter to the horizontality of the external world\\".Essif, Les. Empty Figure on an Empty Stage. Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 2001. 106, 109. Productions It was first presented in London by the English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre in 1963.

Dedicated to St. John the Baptist, the protector of Florence, the new church for the Florentine community in Rome was started in the 16th century and completed in the early 18th, and is the national church of Florence in Rome. History Plan of the Church Iron bridge at San Giovanni dei Fiorentini, ca. 1890. The bridge was built in 1827 and demolished in 1941. Photo by Giuseppe Primoli. Julius II's successor, the Florentine Pope Leo X de' Medici (1513-1521), initiated the architectural competition for a new church in 1518 on the site of the old church of San Pantaleo. Designs were put forward by a number of architects, among them Baldassare Peruzzi, Jacopo Sansovino, Antonio da Sangallo the Younger and the painter and architect Raphael. The dominant initial ideas were for a centralised church arrangement. Sansovino won the competition but the building construction was subsequently executed by Sangallo and Giacomo della Porta. In 1559, Michelangelo was asked by Cosimo I de' Medici, Duke of Tuscany, to prepare designs for the church and he presented a centralised church arrangement but this was not adopted.Heydenreich & Lotz, 1974, p. 257 The nave. The main construction of the church was carried out in 1583-1602 under the architect Giacomo della Porta based on the Latin cross arrangement. Carlo Maderno took over from 1602 to 1620, and directed construction of the dome and the main body of the church. However, the fa√ßade, based on a design by Alessandro Galilei, was not finished until 1734.Guide Rionali di Roma , Rione V, Ponte, Parte IV, 1975, p.16 (in Italian) In 1623-24 Giovanni Lanfranco produced paintings for the Sacchetti chapel. In 1634, the Baroque painter and architect Pietro da Cortona was asked by the Florentine nobleman Orazio Falconieri to design the high altar.Blunt, Anthony. Guide to Baroque Rome, Granada, 1982, p.51; Merz, Jorg Martin. Pietro da Cortona and Roman Baroque Architecture, Yale, 2008, pp 87-91 Drawings for the altar and its setting and a model were prepared but the project was not carried out. Cortona's ideas for the choir included windows hidden from the view of the congregation that would illuminate the altarpiece, an early example of the Baroque usage of a \\"hidden light\\" source, a concept which would be much employed by Bernini. Some twenty to thirty years later, Falconieri resurrected the choir project but gave the commission to the Baroque architect Francesco Borromini, who changed the design to allow for the burial of Orazio's brother, Cardinal Lelio Falconieri. After Borromini‚Äôs death in 1667, the work was completed and partly modified by Cortona and, on his death in 1669, by Ciro Ferri, Cortona's pupil and associate.Merz, J.M. 2008, p 90-91 List of Ordinaries * Joseph-Charles Lef√®bvre (appointed 28 March 1960 - died 2 April 1973) * Juan Carlos Aramburu (appointed 24 May 1976 - died 18 November 2004) * Carlo Caffarra (appointed 24 March 2006 - died 6 September 2017) * Giuseppe Petrocchi (appointed 28 June 2018) Left side wall of the choir or Falconieri Chapel.

Her face was thin and so was the rest of her body. she was one of those girls who look as if they've just happened somehow.\\" She is also described as an anxious girl and has a commanding and forceful nature, as shown several times in the story.

The story starts with Roddy's narration, explaining a little about her past, and Grundo's as well. It then proceeds to a point where her mother tries to do her usual attempt to talk Roddy into staying with her grandfather Hyde. Roddy refuses, as she does not want to leave Grundo alone with his mother and sister.

The plant is a biennial that flowers in the months of July to August. Plants produce seeds abundantly; being a biennial (blooming second year and producing only foliage first) you will need to be careful to identify seedlings the first year, they are fairly small and can easily be overlooked if you are not aware of where they have germinated.

The second book brings more questions: Leonid realizes that Divers are phagocytes of the world of Deep... and the Deep, the thing he is serving for, is no more an abstract idea of freedom, but whatever it is, it exhibits freedom of will and the sudden flashes of arising artificial intelligence, which in the end leads to the higher level of interactions between Leonid and the Deep. The third book is a short story originally published online. It features two endings and is told from a point of view of a young female MVD operative. She is sent to a virtual prison to ensure that no inmate can escape into Deeptown. Instead, she stumbles upon a secret government project aimed at making divers out of prisoners. Leonid is only mentioned (briefly) twice in the story by other characters. Plot =Background= In the late 90s, Dmitry Dibenko, a Russian programmer known for dabbling in mysticism and mind-altering substances, created with a program playing a short movie that would allow him to achieve a new level of awareness during meditations. He dubbed the program Deep, placed it on a webserver and forgot about it. The revolution happened when a simple Ukrainian chap, stayed in office after the work to play his beloved Doom. He watched Dibenko's program, shrugged and launched the game ‚Äî and fell into it. It seemed to him that it was he running along the corridors, ducking the fiery balls and snarling monsters' mugs. Although he was aware that what he was experiencing could not possible be true, he was unable to break the illusion. Left with no choice but to play the game, he completed all levels. When he finished in morning, the illusion ended and he found himself back in the real world, badly covered with bruises. He realized that the program effectively fooled its users into thinking that whatever virtual environment they were viewing was as real as the world around them. Furthermore, the environment did not have to be particularly elaborate. Even if the graphics were crude, the human subconscious would fill in the details and sensations that would enhance the realism. However, there were drawbacks. Because the illusion was so convincing, people who used the Deep program were unable to leave it. Just as that guy needed to finish the game in order to break the illusion, the Deep users needed specially designed exit points that would provide subconscious triggers that facilitated the exit. The leading computer companies quickly seized upon Dibenko's invention to create a cartoonish virtual city that came to be known as Deeptown. Because of the low- tech nature of its graphics, it became available to anyone who had a computer and a dial-up connection. Deeptown gained instant popularity, drawing people from all walks of life and all parts the world. It offered freedom from real- world constraints, which became a style of life and religion of many. But a vast majority of people are unable to leave the Deeptown at will ‚Äî their subconsciousness prevents them from it. They need free communication with their operational systems which was mostly forbidden, or in most cases proper exit terminals. Along with Deeptown, Deep timers were developed to limit the duration of user's stay, because in the worst-case scenario people became so consumed by the Deep's illusion that they completely lost awareness that Deeptown was not the real world, and were effectively trapped in the Deep until they died from dehydration. Once time passed, the timer would deactivate the Deep program. However, it did not solve the problem, as many users managed to switch off their timers. Around this time, the first Divers emerged, people able to break illusion of the Deep program. This allowed them to help those who were trapped in Deeptown, since they could exit the Deeptown instantly and call for help. This ability also freed them from physical constraints other users were bound by, allowing to perform seemingly impossible feats, survive otherwise crippling injuries and change avatars within seconds. In addition to that, Divers were able to see flaws in Deeptown's programming code (usually in the form of holes). Thanks to those abilities, Divers found employment as in- house rescuers, corporate saboteurs and security consultants, among other things. As their numbers grew, Divers began to organize. They created a Code of Divers, which established a set of principles that guided their behavior. Along with other things, it held up the right to privacy as a fundamental right of all Divers. Another important principle was the prohibition against using their abilities to harm their fellow Divers. If a Diver violated any aspect of the Code, he had to submit to a hearing conducted by the rest of the Diver community and abide by whatever penalty they would decide on. Further violations would incur progressively harsher penalties. By the time the events of the book began, Divers were a strange, but accepted part of Deeptown society. Their powers were subject of speculation by the rest of Deeptown community, which is only furthered by Divers' penchant for secrecy. The first novel is told from the first-person perspective and is told by a diver living in a run-down apartment in St. Petersburg. Like most divers, he has to maintain his identity secret, as divers are a prized commodity. They are able to overcome obstacles that can stop even elite hackers. The diver first demonstrates his ability by walking across a string suspended above a chasm, something no normal human is capable of doing, by leaving the deep and walking across by looking at the monitor (it is much easier, as there is no wind or fear of falling). He is soon located by a strange Man Without a Face and offered a job: he must go into a popular virtual game called the \\"Labyrinth of Death\\" to complete a task two other divers started but never completed. In return, he will get Order of Permissiveness that grants its bearer right to do everything he wants within Deeptown. The \\"Labyrinth of Death\\" is a massive multiplayer game based on Doom, where the players must battle monsters, zombies, and each other through large levels of a post-alien-invasion city to reach the end. As told by the director of the company that owns and runs the game, the diver must rescue a trapped player, who disabled his exit timer, before his real world body dies of dehydration or starvation. Adopting the nickname Gunslinger (from a Stephen King eponymous novel), the diver goes on a rampage through the \\"Labyrinth\\", using his diver ability to return to his own body and use standard keyboard and mouse controls to quickly dispatch enemies. Eventually, the other human players stop crossing his path, as rumors of his skill quickly spread throughout the game. After setting a record on the number of levels beat in a short time, the diver (Gunslinger) saves and leaves the \\"Labyrinth\\" only to encounter about a hundred angry players in the exit lobby. All of them are waiting for Gunslinger, but nobody recognizes him without his mask and gear. As he is leaving the lobby, the director of the company calls out and congratulates him on his record. The diver runs out, followed by the angry mob of players, and manages to duck into the nearest \\"building\\" - a virtual brothel. There, he looks through the catalog and, to his surprise, sees a near-perfect image of his operating system (rendered as a woman). He goes to the \\"room\\" where she is and asks her if he can call her Vicka (the same name he calls his computer). She agrees (after all, it's his fantasy), and they start talking about random things. The diver feels tired and falls asleep in her bed. When they wake up, he asks if he can see her again, to which she initially replies by warning him not to fall in love with a virtual image, as the person wearing it can be completely different. Vika then gives up and tells him to ask for her the next time he comes. The diver returns to the \\"Labyrinth\\" and manages to reach the trapped player. Initially, Gunslinger is frustrated when the player refuses to reveal his name or address (real-life location) but is amazed when he finds out that the \\"Jinx\\" (as the director called the player) is a crack shot and should have been able to beat the level without a problem. However, as the pair is nearing the exit, they are ambushed by a large group of monsters, and the Jinx is killed. While Gunslinger is trying to figure out what is going on, the two divers employed by the company show up and tell him that something about Jinx makes him unable to continue. One of them even killed the player 13 times within a 5-minute limit, which should have automatically kicked Jinx out but did not. The two divers ask Gunslinger to give them 6 hours to try to get Jinx to the end of the level, after which Gunslinger can return and try again. He agrees and leaves to the exit lobby, where a dozen players are waiting for him. Instead of attacking him, they offer him a deal: Gunslinger stops killing other players, and the players do not attack him or the Jinx. If a player breaks the deal, then Gunslinger is allowed to kill him or her. To seal the deal, they go to the BFG9000 - a bar near the \\"Labyrinth.\\" After several virtual drinks, the diver goes back to the brothel and asks for Vicka. He finds her room, and she invites him to the brothel's restaurant. There the diver meets the Mage, a hacker employed by the brothel to provide their server with excellent security. Vicka gets upset when one of her regular clients (who keeps accusing the virtual prostitutes of being the scum of society) arrives and asks the diver to take her to his favorite place. He takes her to a bar/restaurant he frequents and asks for a private room. The room looks like a beautiful forest. After unsuccessfully attempting to make love to Vicka (her timer kicks her out), the diver goes back to the \\"Labyrinth\\". The company's divers tell him that they believe that Jinx is only pretending to be in trouble and that they plan to give up their attempts to get him out. The diver, however, has other ideas. After one more unsuccessful attempt, he leaves the game and travels to \\"Al Kabar\\" - the pharmaceutical company he robbed at the beginning of the novel. The company's spokesperson informs him that they are aware of Jinx and suspect that he is the next stage in human evolution - a person able to enter the virtual world without the aid of a computer or a phone line. They also tell him that the owner of \\"Labyrinth\\" will reach a similar conclusion soon. That is when \\"Al Kabar\\" will move in to snatch Jinx to find out what makes him tick. Determined to save Jinx at all costs, the diver logs off and contacts his hacker friend Maniac. He asks him for a virus he could smuggle through \\"Labyrinth\\" security. Maniac is hesitant but he upgrades the diver's Gunslinger character with his latest \\"Warlock 9000\\" virus, which is designed to look like a belt. As the diver is re-entering the \\"Labyrinth\\", the two companies make their moves to grab Jinx. The two \\"Labyrinth\\" divers attempt to stop him, but he uses the Warlock as a whip and attacks them (as seen on the book cover). The attack also opens a vortex-like hole in the program, allowing the diver and Jinx to slip out of the \\"Labyrinth\\" server. With the companies and Man with no Face in hot pursuit, he drags Jinx into the brothel and asks Vicka for protection. Just then, the Deeptown police commissioner makes a PA- like announcement, accusing the diver who looks like Gunslinger of using an illegal virus to attack a company. Vicka, upon finding out that he is a diver, lashes out at him but quickly calms down and admits that she is one too. The brothel comes under a massive attack from \\"Labyrinth\\" and \\"Al Kabar\\" security forces, backed by Deeptown police and Man with no Face. The Mage's defenses manage to put up a fight but are crumbling. The diver, Jinx, and Vicka jump out the window of her room into a virtual landscape she created before the brothel server shuts down, leaving them stranded in the landscape. The diver then tells Vicka what he thinks Jinx really is - a non-corporeal entity from another world who can only interact with humans through Deeptown. Jinx neither confirms nor denies his true nature, only says that he has been travelling for many years through silence. Vicka is skeptical and insists that Jinx is simply a devious hacker playing a game with everybody. They travel for several days through the landscape before finding out that the diver's use of the Warlock virus somehow linked Vicka's landscape with an RPG server, where fantasy fans play in a Lord of the Rings-like world. They find out that the game server plays out a war between King Legolas's elves and an alliance of orcs and dwarves. They leave Jinx (who is wounded from \\"Labyrinth\\") by a road and log off to rest and come back as fantasy characters. While the diver is eating, the Maniac shows up and cleans up his computer, erasing all trace of Warlock and the Gunslinger persona. He then helps the diver design a fantasy character for him - a human healer Elenium (by the name of the tranquiliser). The diver returns to the fantasy server and finds that Vicka is now a male elf archer. They go back to Jinx and try to get him back into Deeptown but are intercepted by Man with no Face and several armed goons. Another diver shows up and attacks the goons looking like a big wolf. As the three are escaping to the streets of Deeptown, Man with no Face manages to attack the wolf with several powerful viruses. Vicka and Jinx manage to escape, but the diver gets attacked with a perpetual deep-program. Even his diver's mantra cannot help him escape the swirling images that keep his subconsciousness in VR. As he is \\"walking\\" through the dream-like world, Jinx appears and tells him that only the diver has the power to escape it. The diver then reverses his mantra and embraces the deep. As he \\"wakes up\\" in Deeptown, he realizes that the virtual world has changed for him. He can now see things as they are (shapes and colors) and can move through programs at will. On the way to his Deeptown house, he encounters Man with no Face, who is surprised that the diver escaped his trap. They sit down and talk about Jinx. Man with no Face is convinced that Jinx is a projection from the future. The diver knows that Man with no Face is really the hacker who created the original deep-program. Man with no Face believes that his creation of the program was no accident. He believes Deeptown was a creation from the future and wishes to know more about it. The diver realizes that his companion is stalling and jumps directly to his Deeptown house to find it surrounded by the two companies' security forces and the police. They open fire on him, but he sends out a virtual wave that erases all the shooters. He then threatens the commissioner, the spokespersons of the companies, and Man with no Face that he can make their lives very unpleasant unless they leave him and Jinx alone. He returns to his house and tells Jinx that he must leave this world. Jinx opens a virtual portal and leaves. The diver takes Vicka and they fly through the Deeptown sky, kissing. At the same time, the diver uses his new abilities to remove all trace that he was ever online. He wipes his computer, his internet provider's logs, and everything else related to him. They then agree to meet in real life. Vicka asks him to wait at the airport with a flower. As the diver logs off, he remembers that he forgot to pay his phone bill - his phone has been disconnected for three hours. He was in Deeptown all on his own. When he finally arrives to the train station, he waits for Vicka. She approaches him from behind and, as he turns around, he is relieves to find out that she looks exactly the same as her virtual persona (as does he). Characters in \\"Labyrinth of Reflections\\" = Major Characters = *Leonid (Gunslinger, Elenium) - the main character, and an experienced Diver. After being fired from an unnamed videogame translating company when it went bankrupt, he spent most of his time in Deeptown, earning money using his skills. Before the advent of Deep, he was an avid player of the original Doom and Wolfenstein 3D and a FidoNet user. In spite, or perhaps because of his Diver abilities, he knows little about computers, which forces him to rely on Maniac for most computer-related stuff. Throughout the course of the novel, he went by aliases of Ivan the Prince, Gunslinger and Healer. *Alexander/Maniac - a skillful hacker who originally worked for the same company as Leonid. He has since achieved certain notoriety both in the Deep and in the real world. Like Leonid, he was in his late 20s, yet he already went through two marriages. At the time of the novel, he was trying to work things out with his third wife. In many cases, Maniac went out of his way to help out Leonid at the expense of everything else. Like most hackers, Maniac hates Windows Home, preferring to use OS/2 or Linux. Formerly known as \\"Shadow\\". *Vicka (short for Victoria aka Madame) - a psychology graduate student who organized a brothel in the Deep as testing grounds for her thesis. While in the brothel, she used two avatars: the older, world-weary Madam and the younger prostitute named Vicka. The second avatar looks exactly like Leonid's Windows Home AI. *Jinx (rus. –ù–µ—É–¥–∞—á–Ω–∏–∫. More proper translation would be a Looser) - a Labyrinth of Death player who appeared on Level 33. Every time he tried to leave the level, he was killed through what seemed like bad luck (which earned him his nickname). He was quickly discovered to be more than he seemed. His nature, and the nature of his powers, served as an ongoing mystery for most of the novel. *Man With No Face - a mysterious man who offered Leonid the job that ultimately propelled the main plot of the novel. = Minor Characters = *Computer Mage - another former co-worker of Leonid. While in real life, he was a sheltered intervert, in the Deep, he became an essentric extravert known for his flamboyant personality. He was a skilled hacker who was employed by Vicka as an in-house programmer for her brothel. *Crazy Tosser/Dick - one of the in-house Divers in Labyrinth of Death game. A friendly, outgoing man who was respected among the Divers. In subsequent novels, he was revealed to be a Black Canadian man in his late 50s. Although he could speak Russian fairly well, he occasionally relied on the aid of the Deep-translator. *Roma/Grey Wolf - a Diver who belonged to a shifter-diver subculture, which specialized in using their Diver ability to instantly change avatars to transform from humans into animals, like the shapeshifters of folklore. His preferred animal avatar was a wolf. He was Leonid's frequent partner who often served as back-up/getaway transportation. Late in the novel, Leonid discovered that he was 15 years old, which put a strain on their friendship. His alias is a reference to a recurring character in Russian folk tales.

Raghavan Thirumulpad (20 May 1920 ‚Äì 21 November 2010) was an Ayurvedic scholar and physician. Thirumulpad studied Sanskrit, Tharkam (Indian philosophy), Jyothisham (Indian astrology) and Vyakarana (grammar) under various teachers. Later he studied Ayurveda under Shri. P. Vasudevan Nambisan and passed the graduation exam called Vaidyabhooshanam. From a very young age he was attracted by Gandhian thought and living and started using and propagating Khadi (the hand-woven cotton fabric which once symbolised Indian nationalism). Raghavan Thirumulpad was very much influenced by Ruskin's essay, Unto This Last, and tried to implement its ethos in his day-to-day practice of medicine. This was a shift in the trend of ayurvedic practice that prevailed all over India in that time. He gave more stress to life-style modifications in his treatment and the least importance was given to medicine. Maximum stress was laid on the importance of physical exercise in the prevention of diseases. He promoted a style highlighting wholesome food, sound sleep, moderated sex and optimal exercise as the four pillars on which a healthy life is built. Thirumulpad taught a number of young ayurvedic graduates to practise ayurveda in a more logical scientific but simple style. He resided during his lifetime at Chalakudy. V.K.R.T. Foundation, consisting of his students, celebrated his 90th birthday on 23 May 2010, at Chalakudy as \\"Navathi Pranamam\\". Many important personalities, including Dr. Rajan Gurukkal, V.C., M.G. University, Dr. K.G. Poulose, V.C. Kerala Kalamandalam, Dr. C. Ratnakaran, Pro. V.C. Kerala University of Health, participated. The release of nine of his books was the highlight of the occasion. On 25 January 2011, the Ayurveda Acharyan was awarded Padma Bhushan posthumously, two months after his death. Chalakudy Municipality commemorated the second year of his demise with a meeting at the Merchants Association hall, Chalakudy, Kerala, India on 21 November 2012. A special award was given to Dr. M.

(top left) 1 kW amplidyne motor-generator, (bottom left) 3 kW amplidyne motor-generator, (right) 5 kW amplidyne generator. Figure 1 of the patent drawing An amplidyne is an electromechanical amplifier invented prior to World War II by Ernst Alexanderson. It consists of an electric motor driving a DC generator. The signal to be amplified is applied to the generator's field winding, and its output voltage is an amplified copy of the field current. The amplidyne is used in industry in high power servo and control systems, to amplify low power control signals to control powerful electric motors, for example. It is now mostly obsolete. How an amplidyne works An amplidyne comprises an electric motor which turns a generator on the same shaft. Unlike an ordinary motor-generator, the purpose of an amplidyne is not to generate a steady voltage but to generate a voltage proportional to an input current, to amplify the input. The motor provides the power, turning the generator at a constant speed, and the signal to be amplified is applied to the generator's field winding. The higher the current applied to the winding, the stronger the magnetic field and thus the higher the output voltage of the generator. So the output voltage of the generator is an amplified copy of the current waveform applied to the field winding. In a typical generator the load brushes are positioned perpendicular to the magnetic field flux. To convert a generator to an amplidyne, what would normally be the load brushes are connected together and the output is taken from another set of brushes that are parallel with the field. The perpendicular brushes are now called the 'quadrature' brushes. This simple change can increase the gain by a factor of 10,000 or more. The amplidyne's frequency response is limited to low frequencies, it cannot even handle audio frequencies, so its use is limited to amplifying low frequency control signals in industrial processes. Historically, amplidynes were one of the first amplifiers to generate very high power (tens of kilowatts), allowing precise feedback control of heavy machinery. Vacuum tubes of reasonable size were unable to deliver enough power to control large motors, but vacuum tube circuits driving the input of an amplidyne could be used to boost small signals up to the power needed to drive large motors. Early (World War II era) gun tracking and radar systems used this approach. Amplidynes are now obsolete technology, replaced by modern power semiconductor electronic devices such as MOSFETs and IGBTs which can produce output power in the kilowatt range. Use in gun mount control systems Amplidyne circuit as used in U.S. Navy naval gun control. This is a high-power position servo system. The amplidyne was first used in the US Navy in servo systems to control the electric motors rotating naval gun mounts, to aim the gun at a target. The system (diagram right) is a feedback control system in which a feedback signal from a sensor representing the current position of the gun is compared with the control signal which represents the desired position, and the difference is amplified by the amplidyne generator to turn the gun mount motor. The components are: *a synchro control transformer; *an amplifier; *the amplidyne motor-generator, which is similar to a Ward Leonard control drive; *and the follow-up DC motor which drives the load to be positioned. Chapter 10 of the U.S. Navy manual Naval Ordnance and Gunnery, Volume 1 (1957) explains the operation of the amplidyne: :\\"The synchro control transformer receives the order signal which indicates electrically what the position of the load should be. The rotor of the synchro control transformer is turned by the response shaft, which is geared to the load and so indicates what the position of the load actually is. The synchro compares the actual load position with the ordered position; and, if the two do not agree, it generates an alternating-current signal which is transmitted to the amplifier. The angular difference between the two positions is called the error, and the signal to the amplifier is the error signal. The error signal indicates by its electrical characteristics the size and direction of the error. If no error exists, the system is said to be in correspondence and the error signal is zero.\\"Naval Ordnance and Gunnery, Volume 1, 1957, U.S. Navy Manual, Chapter 10. Specifically, the phase of the control transformer's output (in phase with the synchro power source, or opposite phase) provided the polarity of the error signal. A phase-sensitive demodulator, with the synchro AC power as its reference, created the DC error signal of the required polarity. Applications Amplidynes were initially used for electric elevators and to point naval guns, and antiaircraft artillery radar such as SCR-584 in 1942. Later used to control processes in steelworks. Used to remotely operate the control rods in early nuclear submarine designs (S3G Triton). Diesel-electric locomotive control systems. Early ALCO road-switcher locomotives used this technology. G. J.

Background In the night's main event, the welterweight champion Dan Henderson knocked out Pride Middleweight Champion Wanderlei Silva to become the new middleweight champion. This victory by Henderson avenged an earlier loss to Silva after their first encounter in 2000 at Pride 12 - Cold Fury, with Silva winning that fight in a three-round unanimous decision. A fight between Sergei Kharitonov and Gilbert Yvel was submitted for approval by the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC). However, the fight did not take place after Yvel was denied a fighter's license by the NSAC based on a history of disqualification from multiple fights, most notably, his infamous attack on a referee. Kharitonov instead fought Mike Russow defeating him with an armbar. A fight between Wes Sims and Kazuyuki Fujita was proposed but the NSAC turned it down due to competitive reasons‚Äîthe fighters were at unequal experience/talent levels. After that a Wes Sims-Mark Hunt fight was turned down as well. The NSAC confirmed that Fujita would not be fighting anyone on the Pride 33 card as the deadline for receiving the medical records of fighters over the age of 35 (Fujita was 36) had passed (they must be submitted one week before the show so they can be properly reviewed and cleared). Travis Wiuff's original opponent, Kazuhiro Nakamura, did not fight due to a knee injury. Nick Diaz defeated Takanori Gomi in a non-title fight via Gogoplata. The victory was later ruled a No Contest due to a failed drug test (Cannabis) from Diaz.

The village is part of the civil parish of Mablethorpe and Sutton. The amenities include a post office, public houses, a general store, a hotel and a paddling pool on the sea front. The southern part of the village is known as Sandilands. History At very low tides it is possible to view the remains of an ancient mixed forest on the beaches of Mablethorpe and Sutton on Sea. It was submerged by rising sea levels about 3000 years ago. Sea flooding was a periodic problem in the Middle Ages. The village was last flooded on 31 January 1953, when a ten-foot storm surge broke through the flood defences.Local home page Retrieved 12 September 2017. The church, which is a Grade II listed building, is dedicated to Saint Clement. It was built in 1818‚Äì19 on a new site, after the previous church was destroyed by the sea. Railway influence The Alford and Sutton Tramway ran from Alford town to Sutton-on-Sea on rails set into the road. It opened in 1884 and closed five years later. Sutton-on-Sea railway station opened as part of the Sutton and Willoughby Railway in 1886, which connected the town southwards, enabling through holiday trains from the industrial Midlands and North of England to reach the resort. In 1888 the line was extended to Mablethorpe. The railway connection encouraged a huge development in Sutton; between July and December 1889 40,328 passengers were carried to Sutton, 1,700 more than to Mablethorpe in the same period.Robin Leleux, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 9: The East Midlands, David and Charles (Publishers) Limited, Newton Abbot, 1976, , pages 206 to 208 The railway lines in the district all closed on 5 October 1970. Harbour plans Sutton le Marsh (as it was then called) was considered to be an ideal location for a new fishing harbour. The Sutton & Willoughby Railway & Dock Company was authorised by Parliament on 28 July 1884 to build docks at Sutton, and to make a railway branch line to the main line at Willoughby. Authorised share capital was ¬£60,000. The company was unable to raise the capital it needed, and it built only the railway line and not the dock. In December 1886 a fresh concern, the North Sea Fisheries Harbour & Dock Company promoted the scheme again, and it asked the Great Northern Railway for financial assistance. The GNR was the dominant network in the area, and at that time rail conveyance of fresh fish to the centres of population was good business for railway companies. Grimsby was well served by a rival railway company, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway and the North Sea Fisheries company hoped that the GNR would fund the construction. However the GNR saw that the dock expenditure would be very heavy, and would not pay, and it refused.John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume II: Expansion and Competition, B T Batsford Limited, London, 1979, , page 145 Port proposed by the Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast RailwayThe idea of a new harbour was revived in 1891, when the Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway was authorised to build a railway line across the country to Sutton. Sutton was preferred to Boston, which was also considered, because land was available at Sutton, and Trinity House said that Sutton was the best site for a port of refuge on that coast. This was a huge project, and once again the company was unable to raise the money it needed; it built a small portion of the planned railway, and did not start the harbour works. Eventually the company became owned by the Great Central Railway, which developed Immingham Docks from 1906. Education Sutton on Sea Community Primary School was built in 1862 as a National School, becoming a board school in 1887, and a council school in 1903. It became a primary school in 1964, and has been called the Sutton on Sea Community Primary School since 1999. Demography =Retired status as to adult majority= When the 2011 census was taken, Sutton on Sea had two electoral wards, North and South. The south ward ranked, out of all 8570 nationwide, 2nd by proportion of retirees in the total population, and the north ward ranked 6th. Between these, ranking 3rd, was neighbouring Trusthorpe and Mablethorpe South, since which time the ward has been redrawn as Mablethorpe).

Especially during the 1960s it supposedly gained popularity in the United Kingdom, with some famous musicians (like George Harrison, Jimmy Page and Eric Clapton) using its guitar models.Futurama electric guitars Nowadays, Jolana guitars are manufactured by New Bohemian Electronics (NBE), which acquired the rights for the brand in 2003.  History  The history of musical instruments manufacturing in former Czechoslovakia started when engineer Ferdinand Machalek created the first piano pickup in the middle 1940s. The origins of the first electric guitars date back to 1953, when the Rezonet factory managed by Josef Ruzicka designed the first instruments in the country. The company manufactured not only guitars but other wooden goods, including furniture.The Story of Czech electric guitar production on ChessyGuitars website Designer Vladimir Vlcek created the first model, a lap steel named \\"Akord\\" which came into production in 1954. It was followed by other Rezonet's guitars, \\"Arioso\\" and \\"Arco\\". Those models became commercial success, being also awarded at the Expo 58 in Brussels.Brief history of electric guitars‚Äô production in Czechoslovakia on Jolana website, 15 Oct 2019 The \\"Grazioso\\", a model based on the Fender Stratocaster, was an immediate success not only in Czechoslovakia but outside the country. The model was exported by Rezonet under the name \\"Futurama\\", with notable musicians such as George Harrison, Jimmy Page and Eric Clapton among its users. In 1959, a new guitar factory, Neoton, opened in Hradec Kr√°lov√©. Managed by Ruzicka, it was soon renamed into \\"Jolana\\" ‚Äìprobably after Ruzicka's daughter name‚Äì. The first Jolana guitar was made in 1960. Semi- acoustic models (\\"Diskant\\" and the successful \\"Tornado\\" in 1963, then followed by the \\"Alexandra\\") were also designed by Jolana, expanding its offer. Moreover, \\"Alexis\\" and \\"Pampero\\" (basses versions of Alexandra and Tornado models) came out in 1965. That same year, a new solid body guitar was introduced, the \\"Hurricane\\", with its bass version, \\"Typhoon\\", in 1965. The Harmonika company was in charge of Tornado production in the city of Ho≈ôovice. By the second half of the 1960s, three major factories produced electric guitars in the CSSR: CSHN, Varhany Krnov and the aforementioned Harmonika. 1975 marked the beginning of production of Jolana guitars in Harmonika Horovice factory. Jolana continued making electric guitars and basses until the end of the 1980s, developing models such as \\"Diamant\\" ‚Äìa Gibson Les Paul copy. Harmonika (later known as \\"Delicia\\") started to manufacture several models such as Cavallero, Tornado, Basora, Diskant 2, Marina 2, Onyx, Jantar, Strat, Studio and Studio Bass. In 1993, Delicia was acquired by \\"Bohemia Musico S.R.O.\\", becoming \\"Bohemia Musico Delicia\\". The company started producing guitars for renewed foreign brands such as Epiphone, Hohner, Spector, American Showster, MTD and others. In 2003, \\"New Bohemian Electronics Corp\\" (NBE), a manufacturing company established two years before, bought the brand \\"Jolana\\" to Delicia, which therefore ceased to produce guitars, focusing on other instruments.

The program aimed to increase firearm tracing of firearms recovered by law enforcement agencies, learn more about how juveniles and youth obtain firearms, and develop strategies to deal with problems involving illegally obtained firearms. Overview The Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative was established on July 8, 1996 by President Bill Clinton. The program was funded through support from the Department of the Treasury‚Äôs Office of Enforcement and the National Institute of Justice. The initiative involved collaboration between local law enforcement agencies, local prosecutors, the United States Attorney's Offices, and the ATF, in tracing firearms recovered by law enforcement. Information learned through the YCGII include: * Types of firearms most frequently recovered by police? * Which crimes these weapons are associated with? * How long it takes for firearms to move from a licensed firearms dealer to recovery by police? * Which states are the source of these firearms? YCGII also looked at differences in illegal firearms activity among adults, juveniles, and youths. The ATF also worked with state and local officials to improve reporting and data collection on recovered firearms and tracing. In 1997, 17 cities across the United States participated in the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative. By 2000, the number of participating jurisdictions increased to 50.

The club went into abeyance in 2000 but entered the south leagues in 2007. History The club was established in 1963 as the Glasgow Police Shinty Team but regionalization led to the adoption of the present name. the club was the brainchild of Dr John Dugald Murchison, who felt a club made of serving police officers (Glasgow having a tradition of having police officers from the Scottish Highlands) would be an ample replacement for the then recently defunct Glasgow Skye. The club was a fixture in the old South Division One until relegation to the South Division 2 which they then won in 1979-80. The police won South Division Two in 1996. In 1998-99 the club played in South Division One but was relegated to the South Division Two. The following year, team raising difficulties led to the club going into abeyance. The force re-entered the South leagues in 2007, playing their first game against Edinburgh East Lothian. The Glasgow Airport Attack on Saturday 30 June 2007 and the perceived increase in security threat meant that the Police team had to withdraw from competition for the remainder of the 2007 season. It is unlikely that Strathclyde Police will ever retake the field in league shinty, but their old ground of Lochinch is used by Glasgow Gaels Shinty Club,a junior side, who it is hoped will become a senior side.

E_f is the fermi level, N(E) is the density of states for spin down (on the left) and spin up (on the right). In this case, the half-metal is conducting in the minority spin channel. A half- metal is any substance that acts as a conductor to electrons of one spin orientation, but as an insulator or semiconductor to those of the opposite orientation. Although all half-metals are ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic), most ferromagnets are not half-metals. Many of the known examples of half- metals are oxides, sulfides, or Heusler alloys. In half-metals, the valence band for one spin orientation is partially filled while there is a gap in the density of states for the other spin orientation. This results in conducting behavior for only electrons in the first spin orientation. In some half- metals, the majority spin channel is the conducting one while in others the minority channel is. Half-metals were first described in 1983, as an explanation for the electrical properties of Mn-based Heusler alloys. Some notable half-metals are chromium(IV) oxide, magnetite, and lanthanum strontium manganite (LSMO), as well as chromium arsenide. Half-metals have attracted some interest for their potential use in spintronics.

Her family moved to Brooklyn, New York when she was quite young. Von Behren was educated in the Brooklyn public schools. Stage actress Von Behren was a forewoman for a dry goods store in Brooklyn, when at the age of 19, she realized a sudden yearning to become an actress. She studied acting with Rose Watson, who was at one time a variety performer on stage. Von Behren's career as a dramatic actress began in 1876, traveling for a year with Rose and Harry Watson. She appeared in Catharine Mavourneen and Trodden-down Dick, or a Child of the Streets. Afterwards she performed in The Two Orphans and Imogene. She traveled for a time with Annie Louise Buckingham, playing the title role in Mazeppa. In 1880 Von Behren became a leading member of the stock company of the Coliseum Theater in Cincinnati, Ohio. She was there for most of the season before finishing in Newark, New Jersey at Wallman's Opera House. Von Behren joined the Si Slocum company of Frank Frayne at Harry Miner's Theater in the fall of 1881. She left the company prior to the end of the season and returned to Wallman's. There she played in Lucretia Borgia and Lady of Lyons. She closed the season with Fayne at Niblo's Garden in Mardo; or Nihilists of St. Petersburg, Russia. This was in July 1881. Accidental death Von Behren began a western tour with Frayne's company beginning in September 1882. She was a part of a matinee performance of Si Slocum at the Coliseum in Cincinnati on Thanksgiving Day. During the fourth act of this production she was shot in the head and killed by Frayne, when he pointed a .22 caliber rifle (parlor rifle) at her and it accidentally discharged. The bullet entered her skull just above the eye and she died within fifteen minutes. The curtain fell, the play stopped, and Frayne was arrested immediately. The audience believed the actress was only slightly injured, yet there was near panic in the theater when the curtain came down. During a police deposition on December 2 Frayne stated that the thread of the screw which held the spring catch was worn or torn off, and that sent the bullet below its aim. He was attempting a backward shot when the catch snap of the rifle became imperfect and slipped just as the hammer was released. Frayne's breast and neck were burned black by the powder emitted by the breech of the gun. The presiding judge agreed with the actor who claimed to have pointed the gun at an apple six inches above the head of Von Behren. The prosecution rested but contended a charge of manslaughter should have been upheld because of a statute. The law forbade a person from pointing a loaded gun at or toward another person. When Frayne was discharged from the court, the decision to free the actor was given emphatic applause. Newspapers reported Frayne and Von Behren were engaged to be married. The remains of Annie Von Behren were sent on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to Brooklyn on December 2. They were destined for the home of her parents, at No. 180 Stockton Street, Brooklyn. Frank Frayne and the entire stock company accompanied the body and attended the actress' funeral. She was survived by an aged father and mother, two sisters, and a small brother. Her acting was the family's chief means of support.

He has played five matches for the Denmark national football team. Club career He began playing youth football with amateur club Randers KFUM. He spent some years in the youth teams of Randers Freja, but quickly returned to KFUM. He played in the lower leagues of Danish football with KFUM, before joining Randers Freja under manager Frank Petersen at the age of 21 in 1998. He started as a left winger, but was eventually moved back as left back by Freja manager Ole Fritsen. He played in a Freja team also containing Michael Gravgaard and Svenne Poulsen, and helped the club move from the third- tier Danish 2nd Division to the second-tier Danish 1st Division, before moving to 1st Division rivals Vejle Boldklub under Frank Petersen in 2002. =Odense Boldklub= He joined Odense Boldklub (OB) on loan in the winter break of the Danish Superliga 2003-04 season, and impressed enough that he was signed on a permanent deal before the season started. He quickly established himself in the starting line-up, playing the last 13 games of that season as OB finished fifth. For the following six seasons, S√∏rensen would miss only three Superliga games. He helped the club finish third in the Danish Superliga 2005-06, and was named for the 2006 \\"Danish Team of the Year\\". He was named Ulrik Laursen's vice-team captain, and was part of the OB team which won the 2007 Danish Cup Final. He was again named for the 2007 \\"Danish Team of the Year\\". In November 2007, he received his first red card of his OB career in a game against Randers FC. He was evicted for intervening in a confrontation between OB's Norwegian Bengt S√¶ternes and Randers' Ghanaian Issah Ahmed by stating that \\"this is Denmark\\", which the referee deemed \\"indecent language\\" towards Ahmed. S√∏rensen stated that he did not have any racistic intention but wanted to end the confrontation which he found an annoying pause in the game, and had finished the sentence \\"and we clearly don't speak the same language\\". The explanation was accepted by the Danish Football Association, who did not impose any additional punishment except from the one-game suspension due to the red card. When Laursen left OB in the winter 2007, S√∏rensen declined to become new team captain, settling as vice-captain to Esben Hansen. He eventually established himself as captain during Hansen's prolonged absence from the team and subsequent loan deal in the summer 2009. S√∏rensen helped OB finish second in the Danish Superliga 2008-09 and Danish Superliga 2009-10 seasons. =Randers FC= In the start of 2012 he signed a 2 year long contract with Randers FC. International career S√∏rensen was called up for the Denmark League XI national football team, to play a number of unofficial national team games in the Hong Kong in January 2006, by national team manager Morten Olsen. He was hospitalized due to dehydration after the first game, but returned to the team for the third and last game of the tour. He was again called up for the League XI tours in January 2007, 2008, and 2009, playing a combined total seven games for the team. In October 2007, he was included by Olsen in the A national team, and made his debut in the 3‚Äì1 win against Latvia in the UEFA Euro 2008 qualification tournament. He played a further two qualification games in November 2007. He played his fourth national team game in a row in February 2008, before he was dropped from the team in favour of Thomas Rasmussen. He returned to the national team in February 2009, playing his fifth game. He was called up again in August 2009, but had to pull out of the squad injured. In July 2017, S√∏rensen was part of the Danish squad for the first-ever Star Sixes tournament at the O2 Arena. Scoring four goals en route to the final, he ended up being voted Star of the Tournament ahead of M√≠chel Salgado, Robert Pires and Gilberto Silva. Denmark lost the final against France 1-2.

The 15 minute show was broadcast twice a week, Wednesdays and Fridays, at 5pm Eastern, although some local stations showed both episodes together as a single 30 minute show. Barker Bill was a portly circus ringmaster with a long black handlebar mustache and dressed in the traditional costume - a fancy suit with white gloves and a top hat. The show was hosted by a stationary picture of the Barker Bill character with an off-camera announcer introducing the cartoons. The show featured old black and white cartoons obtained from Terrytoons. These were mostly older cartoons from the 1930s, like Farmer Al Falfa and Kiko the Kangaroo, not the more current and better known series such as Mighty Mouse and Heckle and Jeckle. Barker Bill did not appear in cartoons, but was briefly featured in a newspaper comic strip series from September 1954 to 1955. Terrytoons was the first major animation studio to give television a license to show its library of old black and white cartoons. The Barker Bill series was so successful that CBS offered to buy the Terrytoons studio, including its production facilities and library of cartoons. Paul Terry accepted the offer and retired in 1955. This brought well-known Terrytoons characters Mighty Mouse, Heckle and Jeckle and others to television, replacing the Barker Bill series in 1956. The color cartoons were originally broadcast in black and white, but were still suitable when television switched to color and continued to be part of CBS programming until the 1980s. The older cartoons from the Barker Bill show were re-packaged for syndication under various titles, including Farmer Alfalfa and His Terrytoons Pals, The Terry Toons Club, and Terry Toons Circus.

At just over in length, State Route 238 had its southern terminus at the U.S. Route 62 (US 62)/SR 3 concurrency less than southeast of Bloomingburg. Its northern terminus was at SR 38 in the downtown of the Fayette County village. Designated in the mid-1920s and located in the northeastern quadrant of Fayette County, SR 238 essentially served as a spur route between the US 62/SR 3 concurrency and SR 38, as the two routes ran generally parallel with one another at a separation of about for a distance of approximately between Washington Court House and Bloomingburg. This route provided a connection for the parallel state-maintained roadways at the northeastern end of the run in parallel. Route description All of SR 238 was located in the eastern portion of Fayette County. In a 2013 traffic survey, around 2,380 cars traveled on SR 238 on average daily. The short journey of SR 238 commenced at the rural Union Township intersection of US 62 and SR 3 and Old Springfield Road (CR 137). Heading northwest from there, the two-lane state highway traveled amidst a vastness of farmland, while passing by a couple of homes along the way. After crossing a set of railroad tracks, SR 238 entered Bloomingburg. With the Bloomingburg Cemetery abutting the west side of the highway, SR 238, which is now known as Main Street, passed a business and some residences prior to coming to an end at its junction with SR 38 at a four-way stop intersection in the village's downtown area. History SR 238 was designated in 1924 along the routing that it occupied for its entire history near Bloomingburg. The highway did not experience any significant changes between its designation and decommissioning between 2014 and 2015, when it was replaced by a rerouted SR 38.

The committee existed until 1891, when its name was changed to the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. Its issues and jurisdictions have variably flowed through several iterations and currently rest within the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce. History and jurisdiction During this period, the committee's jurisdiction extended to \\"commerce, Life-Saving Service, and light-houses, other than appropriations for Life-Saving Service and light-houses.\\"Asher C. Hinds, Hinds' Precedents of the House of Representatives of the United States (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1907) Vol. 4, p. 736.

The committee's responsibilities included its traditional customs collection districts, ports of entry, and ports of delivery, and compensation of customhouse officials. The committee exercised jurisdiction over obstructions to harbor navigation, such as sunken vessels, lighthouses and other aids, and matters relating to lifesaving stations and such federal agencies as the Lifesaving Service, Revenue Cutter Service and the Marine Hospital Service (the predecessor of the Public Health Service). Starting in 1824,See: Gibbons v. Ogden and the General Survey Act it added the dangerous obstructions of riverine navigation, such as removing sandbars and snags, dredging, lighthouses and other navigation aids; regulations and appropriations regarding navigable rivers and works affecting them, such as cribs, canals and locks, and later bridges, dams, tunnels, pipes, as well as later inter-oceanic canals and ocean cables as they arose. Commercial aspects regarding public health and the prevention of infectious diseases, the purity of food and drugs, regulations regarding the exportation of livestock and foodstuffs, and transportation of livestock also came under the committee's purview. When the House Committee on Rivers and Harbors was established on December 19, 1883, the Committee on Commerce relinquished its jurisdiction over appropriations for the improvement of rivers and harbors. But when the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 was passed, its Interstate Commerce Commission added greatly to the committee's purview and the commercial regulation of railroads.

Lee was sentenced to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after 20 years in the killing of his sister-in-law, but despite DNA evidence and his confession in 2019, he could not be prosecuted for the other murders because the statute of limitations had expired. Hwaseong serial murders The Hwaseong serial murders () were a series of rapes and murders that occurred in the rural city of Hwaseong in Gyeonggi Province between September 15, 1986, and April 3, 1991, a period four-year and seven-month. The victims, all women, were found bound, gagged, raped and in most cases strangled to death with their own clothes, such as pantyhose or socks. The murders sparked the largest criminal case in South Korea with over 2 million man-days spent on investigation and over 21,000 suspects investigated. The case remained unsolved for 30 years, until Lee Choon-jae was identified as a suspect in 2019, confessing to killing 14 people, 4 undisclosed murders not attributed to the serial murders and all 10 victims of the serial murders including the case previously determined to be a copycat crime, where Yoon Sang-Yeo was sentenced to life in prison. The serial murders are considered to be the most infamous in South Korea's modern history. They are often compared to those committed by the Zodiac Killer in the United States, and served as the inspiration for the 2003 film Memories of Murder. = Background = The case began with the disappearance of Lee Wan-im (71) on September 15, 1986, while returning home after visiting her daughter. He body was found in a pasture on September 19, 1986 at 14:00, 4 days following the murder. A month later on October 20, 1986, Park Hyun-sook (25) disappeared after getting off the bus while returning home from Songtan. Her body was found on October 23, 1986 at 14:50 in a canal. Two months later on December 12, 1986, Kwon Jung-bon (25) disappeared in front of her house. He body was found three years later on April 23, 1987 at 14:00 in an embankment. The last murder was estimated to have taken place around 9:00 p.m. on April 3, 1991. Kwon Soon-sang (69) was discovered dead, raped and strangled with pantyhose on a hill. = Investigation = The case is infamous within Korea for being the first truly identifiable string of murders with a modus operandi. More than 2 million police officers, a record number for a single case, have been mobilized to investigate the murders. Moreover, police officers involved spent two million man-days on the case. The total number of suspects also grew to enormous numbers, eventually ending with a total count of 21,280 individuals. In addition, 40,116 individuals have had their fingerprint taken, and 570 DNA samples and 180 hair samples were analyzed. The first five murders happened within a 6 km (3.7 mile) radius in Hwaseong, prompting police spread out in teams of two, dotted every 100 meters (328 feet), but the next killing happened where there was no police presence. Along the investigation, rumors about the killer targeted women wearing red clothes on rainy days popped up, leading some female police officers to wear red cloths in an attempt to lure the killer into a trap. A suspect sketch was drawn based on the memory of the bus driver, Kang, and bus conductor, Uhm, who saw a man get on the bus shortly after the seventh murder on September 7, 1988. The characteristics of the suspect, which were described by the bus driver, were similar to the descriptions given by survivors who were sexually assaulted. According to the victims, the culprit at the time of the incident was a thin-framed man in his mid-20s, with a height of 165 to 170 centimeters, a short cut sporty-type hair, no double eyelids, and a sharp nose. In addition, he was described as having soft hands. Police also stated that the suspect had a \\"B\\" blood type, but in 2019, police acknowledged that this was likely inaccurate, because Lee has blood type \\"O\\". On July 27, 1989, hair evidence left in the crime scene lead to the arrest of 22-years-old male with the surname of Yoon as the culprit in the murder of the eighth victim, which was later deemed as unrelated to the other murders. In addition, in the tenth case, the genes obtained from semen sample was different from the 9th case, and the location and method of crime were different from the other cases, concluding that it was a different culprit. Except for the first crime which occurred around 6 am, the 2nd-10th murders occurred mainly between 7 and 11 pm. Reports state that at least four individuals, deemed as possible suspects, took their own lives in the 1990s after being investigated and allegedly abused by police. = Copycat crime = On July 27, 1989, Yoon Sang-Yeo, a 22-year-old man, was arrested for the murder of the eighth victim, 14-year-old Park Sang-hee. Yoon admitted guilt during questioning, and according to a 1989 report written by an expert at National Forensic Service, the forensic tests of pubic hair samples found at the scene suggested similarities with his, returning a 40% match with Yoon's. This case was determined to be a copycat crime, and Yoon was sentenced to life in prison, but appealed the ruling at the time, alleging that police coerced him into giving false confessions through torture. His appeal was denied and he served 19.5 years in jail before being released on parole in 2009. Yoon filed for a re-trial of his case on 13 November 2019 following news reports that Lee had confessed to all 10 serial murders. Two days later, police announced that they had reached a provisional conclusion that Lee was responsible for the murder for which Yoon was convicted. Police said Lee's confession in the eighth murder 'elaborately and coherently' described both the scene and the victim. This raised concerns that police had charged an innocent man,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/03/asia/south-korea-hwaseong-apology-intl- hnk/index.html with the district prosecutors‚Äô office confirming that Yoon underwent cruel treatment by investigators at the time of his arrest and that a forensic report by the National Forensic Service had been fraudulently written. On December 2019, the Gyeonggi South Provincial Police Agency booked and charged eight of the original investigators with abuse of power and illegal detention for allegedly physically abusing Yoon when he was a suspect, forcing him to make a false confession, and falsifying investigative documents. The court accepted the plea for a re-trail in January 2020. The final court hearing will be held on November 2020 where Lee Choon-jae will stand as a witness. = Public reaction = The release of the film Memories of Murder in 2003, which was partially inspired by the serial murders, sparked renewed interest in the case. The murder of a female college student in Hwaseong in 2004 also sparked renewed interest and fears that a serial killer had returned. The serial murders made headlines again as the statute of limitations for the most recent victims was due to expire on April 2, 2006. At the time of the killings, there was a 15-year statute of limitations for first-degree murder. This was increased to 25 years in 2007, and finally lifted in 2015, but it was not retroactive. However, evidence and police records were kept due to the significance of the case. Robbery charges On September 26, 1989, around 0:55 am, Lee broke into a house in Gwangju, Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, with weapons and gloves, and was discovered by the landlord. He was sentenced by the Suwon District Court to one year and six months in prison in the first trial in February 1990 for the charges of robbery and violence. After the first trial, Lee filed an appeal, claiming that he was beaten by an unknown young man and entered the victim's house while being chased. In the second trial following Lee's appeal, the court suspended his sentence to two years of probation, where he was released in mid-April, 1990. Sister-in-law's murder and arrest After Lee's wife left him in December 1993, he invited over his 18-year-old sister-in-law, then proceeded to drug, rape and kill her on January 13, 1994. According to the detective who investigated him, Lee went to his father-in-law offering help in the search for his missing sister-in-law, where they both reported that she might have been abducted. Lee was arrested a few days later, on January 18, after repeated questioning where he later asked, \\" How many years do you serve in prison for rape and murder?\\" Lee denied any responsibility and the court overturned his confession, stating that he made a false statement because of police coercion. However, Lee was convicted and sentenced to death in May 1994, and his conviction was upheld in September of the same year. The Supreme Court of South Korea reviewed the case in 1995 and Lee's sentence was reduced to a life sentence, with the possibility of parole after 20 years. Identification and confession On September 18, 2019, police announced that Lee had been identified as a suspect in the serial murders. He was identified after DNA from the underwear of one of the victims was matched with his, and subsequent DNA testing linked him to four of the other unsolved serial murders. At the time he was identified, he was already serving a life sentence at a prison in Busan for the rape and murder of his sister-in-law. Lee initially denied any involvement in the serial murders, but on 2 October 2019, police announced that Lee had confessed to killing 14 people, including all 10 victims in the serial murders, which includes a case previously considered to be a copycat crime, and 4 others. Three of those other murders happened in Hwaseong but had not previously been attributed to the serial killer, and the other two happened in Cheongju. As of October 2019, details about those 4 victims have not been released because the investigation is ongoing. In addition to the murders, he also confessed to more than 30 rapes and attempted rapes.https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20191217003400315 On 15 November 2019, police announced that they had reached a provisional conclusion that Lee was responsible for all 10 serial murders. Police expressed that Lee had a weak self-esteem due to his introverted personality but experienced a sense of accomplishment and self-reliance for the first time in his mandatory military service, which led him to commit sex crimes to express his frustration caused by his monotonous life following his discharge from the military. The provincial police chief stated that Lee displayed psychopathic tendencies being unable to empathize with the victims' pain and sufferings at all and continuously showed off his crimes. On July 2, 2020 the police confirmed that Lee committed 14 murders and 9 rape cases in relation to the Hwaseong serial murders with the motive of relieving his sexual desire, closing the case after 33 years of the first victim's death.

The erinyes represent the guilt for murdering his mother. In criminal law, guilt is the state of being responsible for the commission of an offense. Legal guilt is entirely externally defined by the state, or more generally a \\"court of law\\". Being \\"guilty\\" of a criminal offense means that one has committed a violation of criminal law, or performed all the elements of the offense set out by a criminal statute.See generally United States v. Rivera-Gomez, 67 F.3d 993, 997 (1st Cir. 1995). The determination that one has committed that violation is made by an external body (a \\"court of law\\") and is, therefore, as definitive as the record-keeping of the body. So the most basic definition is fundamentally circular: a person is guilty of violating a law, if a court says so. Philosophically, guilt in criminal law is a reflection of a functioning society and its ability to condemn individuals' actions. It rests fundamentally on a presumption of free will, in which individuals choose actions and are, therefore, subjected to external judgement of the rightness or wrongness of those actions. Moral and legal definitions \\"Guilt\\" is the obligation of a person who has violated a moral standard to bear the sanctions imposed by that moral standard. In legal terms, guilt means having been found to have violated a criminal law, though law also raises 'the issue of defences, pleas, the mitigation of offences, and the defeasibility of claims'.Erving Goffman, Relations in Public (Penguin 1972) p. 139 Les Parrott draws a three-fold distinction between \\"objective or legal guilt, which occurs when society's laws have been broken... social guilt...[over] an unwritten law of social expectation\\", and finally the way \\"personal guilt occurs when someone compromises one's own standards\\".Les Parrott, Shoulda Coulda Woulda (2003) p. 87 Remedies Guilt can sometimes be remedied by: punishment (a common action and advised or required in many legal and moral codes); forgiveness (as in transformative justice); making amends (see reparation or acts of reparation), or \\"restitution ... an important step in finding freedom from real guilt';Parrott, p. 152-3 or by sincere remorse (as with confession in Catholicism or restorative justice). Guilt can also be remedied through intellectualisation or cognition see cognitive therapy under Cognitive therapy (the understanding that the source of the guilty feelings was illogical or irrelevant). Helping other people can also help relieve guilt feelings: \\"thus guilty people are often helpful people ... helping, like receiving an external reward, seemed to get people feeling better\\".E. R. Smith/D. M. Mackie, Social Psychology (2007) p. 527-8 There are also the so-called \\"Don Juans of achievement ... who pay the installments due their superego not by suffering but by achievements.... Since no achievement succeeds in really undoing the unconscious guilt, these persons are compelled to run from one achievement to another\\".Fenichel, p. 502 Law does not usually accept the agent's self- punishment, but some ancient codes did: in Athens, the accused could propose their own remedy, which could, in fact, be a reward, while the accuser proposed another, and the jury chose something in-between. This forced the accused to effectively bet on his support in the community, as Socrates did when he proposed \\"room and board in the town hall\\" as his fate. He lost and drank hemlock, a poison, as advised by his accuser.

Early life Born in High Ercall, Newport was the fifth and second surviving son of Francis Newport, 1st Earl of Bradford and his wife Lady Diana Russell, daughter of Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford on 21 May 1672, aged 17 and was called to the Bar by the Inner Temple in 1678 He became a reader of Inner Temple in 1700. Political career At the 1695 general election, Newport was returned as Member of Parliament for Ludlow and also became a freeman of Ludlow. At the 1698 general election, he was initially defeated at Ludlow, but petitioned and was seated on 1 March 1699. In 1699 he was appointed to the post of Commissioner of Customs which he held until 1712. At the general election of January 1701 Newport was elected as MP for Winchelsea but irregularities in the poll resulted in the Mayor being imprisoned and the election declared void on 27 February 1701. There was no re-election before the November 1701 election at which Newport did not stand. Newport returned to parliament at the 1715 general election, when he was returned unopposed as MP for (Much) Wenlock on the interest of his brother, Lord Bradford. Also in 1715, he was appointed a Lord of the Treasury and held this office until 1718.

The novel is the third in what is now a four-part series, preceded by the novels The Sportswriter (1986) and Independence Day (1995); and followed by Let Me Be Frank With You (2014), a collection of \\"long\\" stories. Each of these books follows a portion of the life of Frank Bascombe, a real estate agent moving through early middle age towards his later years in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. The Lay of the Land was nominated for a 2006 National Book Critics Circle Award. Plot The Lay of the Land takes place in the fall of 2000, and Ford's character Frank Bascome is preparing for Thanksgiving at his home in Sea Clift, New Jersey. His son Paul, who is now a greeting card designer in Kansas City, Paul's girlfriend, who has only one hand, and Frank's daughter, Clarissa, who is an on-and-off lesbian, are all expected to attend. Frank has ordered a ready-made organic meal to be delivered on the holiday. Frank's second wife, Sally, has reunited with her formerly AWOL and presumed-dead husband Wally, and they now live in the British Isles. Frank is in the last throes of a fight against prostate cancer, and Frank's first wife, Ann, has moved back to Haddam, New Jersey, after the death of her second husband. Frank has started RealtyWise, his own company, and employs Mike Mahoney, a Tibetan who has adopted an American Republican lifestyle, except inasmuch as he believes in Buddhist philosophy. Over the course of three days, Frank has a range of painful experiences with everyone he meets, including potential home buyers, the father of an old flame, his former wife, his son, and an old acquaintance whom Frank assaults in a bar. Frank's most redeeming moments as a character are in a lesbian bar where he waits for repair work on his Chevrolet Suburban, and when he gets shot in the chest by teenagers who have murdered his unlikable neighbors. In the end, Frank and Sally are flying to the Mayo Clinic to get the final word on his prostate. Reception The Lay of the Land received largely‚Äîbut not universally‚Äîpositive reviews. Merle Rubin of The Christian Science Monitor commented that the book \\"bristles with energy, with a natural assurance on the part of its writer.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald noted that \\"the tone of The Lay of the Land is somber, despite a few patches of high comedy, and its style is markedly introspective,\\" adding that \\"Ford is such a fine writer that he pulls off a notable feat.\\" In a review for The Observer Tim Adams of wrote \\"Often in the book, you feel like you could listen to Frank observing his life for ever; very occasionally, it feels like you are,\\" adding \\"There's not a line in the nearly 500 pages that you would want to lose, though.\\" The Wall Street Journal complimented the book, writing \\"Mr. Ford's prose, however, is far from dull; virtuosic flights and crescendos animate passages that we might otherwise think we could do without.\\" In contrast, Michiko Kakutani at The New York Times called the book \\"lethargic\\" and a \\"padded, static production.\\"Revisiting Middle Age, That Home of Despair References External links *\\"The Man in the Big Car\\": a review in the TLS by James Campbell, October 2006 *Metacritic -reviews *Official publisher website Category:2006 American novels Category:Novels by Richard Ford Category:Novels set in New Jersey Category:Alfred A.

Kristensen has been capped eleven times for the Danish national team. Club career =FC Nordsjj√¶lland= In January 2005 Kristensen moved from Lyngby Boldklub in Danish 2nd Division to the Danish Superliga team FC Nordsj√¶lland. Although it was a big step up, Kristensen became a regular first team player from the beginning. =F.C. Copenhagen= In both the 2007‚Äì08 winter and 2008 summer transfer windows, Kristensen had been rumoured to be in the process of a deal with F.C. Copenhagen (FCK). On 9 July 2008 TV 2 Sporten reported that Kristensen had agreed with FCK, and only the transfer fee needed to be agreed. In the beginning, FCK and Nordsj√¶lland could not agree on a transfer fee, so it was announced that Kristensen would join F.C. Copenhagen on 1 January 2009 on a free transfer. The clubs subsequently agreed on a transfer fee the next day, and on 15 July 2008 Kristensen became a F.C. Copenhagen player. Only two days later Kristensen played his first match for FCK. It was a UEFA Cup qualifier against Cliftonville at Mourneview Park, where he replaced William Kvist in the 69th minute. In May 2014 Thomas Kristensen secured a 3‚Äì2 Victory against Odense Boldklub in the 86th minute. This meant that FCK finished 2nd, in the league table that season. =Eredivisie= On 22 June 2014, it was announced that Kristensen had signed a two-year deal with Eredivisie side ADO Den Haag. =Brisbane Roar= On 27 July 2016, Kristensen was signed to A-League side Brisbane Roar.

The referee (Stephan Lucas) had also pointed to the penalty spot. The Roar were ready to make their change. However, they used up their three substitutes, so their other goalkeeper, Jamie Young could not come on to the field. Kristensen was chosen to be their backup goalkeeper and switched jerseys from outfield to goalkeeper jersey as he faced Sergio Cirio into a penalty kick which was converted by the Adelaide striker in the 98th minute which ended into a 2‚Äì1 win for Adelaide United. =FC Helsing√∏r= On 1 August 2019 FC Helsing√∏r confirmed, that Kristensen had joined the club on a 1-year contract.THOMAS ‚ÄúTK‚Äù KRISTENSEN NY MAND I FCH-TR√òJEN, fchelsingor.dk, 1 August 2019 International career In January 2007 Kristensen was called upon by the Danish national team, which was touring north and central America in a string of friendly games in the United States, El Salvador and Honduras, by team manager, Morten Olsen.

Biography Umar was one of the prominent companions sahaba of Muhammad. With the conversion of Umar, Islam strengthened and Muslims openly preached Islam. During the space of ten years, Umar succeeded in building the largest empire in the history. Under his leadership the Muslims emerging from the deserts of Arabia overthrew the empire of Persia in the east and shattered the empire of Byzantine in the west. He was the head of the largest State in the world, and yet he lived the life of a common man. Of simple habits, austere and frugal, he was always accessible to the meanest of his subject, and yet he was a cause of terror for the wrong doer. He would wander about at night to enquire into the condition of the people without any guard or escort. Family The exact date of birth of Umar is not known. The consensus, however, is that Umar was born at Mecca around 580 AD. The house in which Umar was born in Mecca was situated midway between Safa and Marwah. During the period of his caliphate, Umar had the house dismantled, and the site was turned into a camping ground. He was younger than the Islamic Prophet Muhammad by about ten years. Muhammad and Umar had Ka'b as their common ancestor in the ninth degree. Among Umar's ancestors are *Adi, eponym of Umar's tribe, the Banu Adi *Nufayl, Umar's paternal grandfather *Khattab ibn Nufayl, Umar's father *Khantamah, Umar's mother *Hisham ibn al-Mughirah, maternal grandfather of Umar and brother of Walid ibn al-Mughira, who was the father of General Khalid ibn al-Walid. Khalid was thus a cousin of Umar's mother. *Abu Jahl whose personal name was Amr bin Hisham was a brother of Umar's mother, and his maternal uncle. Umar had several brothers and sisters. The most well known out of these were: Zayd ibn al-Khattab and Fatimah bint al-Khattab. Zayd and Umar were step brothers, their mothers being different. Nevertheless, the two brothers were devoted to each other. When Zayd was later martyred at the Battle of Yamama during the caliphate of Abu Bakr, Umar was highly grieved. He used to say, \\"Whenever the wind blows from Yamama, it brings me the fragrance of Zayd\\". Fatimah was the real sister of Umar. She was married to her cousin Saeed bin Zaid. She played an important role in the conversion of Umar to Islam. Amr, a brother of Khattab was a paternal uncle of Umar. Zaid, son of Amr and cousin of Umar, was among the distinguished persons of the Quraish, who before the advent of Islam gave up Idolatry, and came to believe in the unity of God. Khattab persecuted Zaid for his religious beliefs. Zaid died before Muhammad announced his prophetic mission. When Muhammad proclaimed his prophethood, Saeed the son of Zaid who had married Umar's sister Fatimah, was among early converts to Islam. 634 ‚Äì 644: Umar's era states that An-Nawawi said in his Tahdhib: > Umar was the first to adopt the whip. Ibn Sa'd mentions it in the Tabaqat, > and he said: It used to be said, after him, 'The whip of 'Umar is more > terrible than your sword.' He (an-Nawawi) continued: He was the first to > appoint Qadis in the provinces, the first who established the provinces of > (the cities of) Kufah, Basrah, and of Mesopotamia, Syria, Cairo (Egypt), and > Mosul.History of the Caliphs by Suyuti Legacy =Merits= Sunnis honor him as the following: *One of the Rashidun History of the Caliphs by Suyuti, quoting An-Nawawi *One of the Ten Promised Paradise *one of the in-laws of Muhammad *one of the great men of knowledge of the Companions *one of their abstinent people. *One who opened the Door of Ijtehad,http://alquraan.net/khulafa/Umar.html which later helped Muslim jurists in interpretation of Quran and Hadith.Allama Shibli Nomani writes in his book 'Al-Farooq' /http://alquraan.net/khulafa/Umar.html References Category:Sunni belief and doctrine Category:Umar ","title":"Sunni view of Umar"},{"id":"8033316","text":"Kenzaburo Hara (ÂéüÂÅ•‰∏âÈÉé) may refer to: * Kenzaburo Hara (IJN officer), commander of the Japanese forces at the Battle of Sunda Strait in 1942 * Kenzaburo Hara (legislator) (1907‚Äì2004) Japan's longest serving legislator ","title":"Kenzaburo Hara"},{"id":"8033318","text":"State Route 232 (SR 232, OH 232) is an east-west state highway situated in the southwestern corner of the U.S. state of Ohio.

His publications are well known in the hobby of sports card collecting. Beckett earned a Ph.D. degree in statistics at Southern Methodist University in 1975 and then joined the faculty of Bowling Green State University as an Associate Professor. While at Bowling Green, Beckett began preparing baseball card price guides, which he offered free upon request. Beckett price guides rely upon information from sellers throughout the United States, who supply information on customer interest and sales of products. Price guides typically carry two value labels, one based upon a high value, the other denoting low values. As the condition of collectibles is important in ascertaining their value, Beckett price guides also typically include a series of definitions for estimating condition. In November 1984, Beckett began publishing Beckett Baseball Card Monthly. (Rival publication Tuff Stuff was also founded that year.) Beckett Baseball Card Monthly grew in popularity and became the basis for the success of Beckett Media, now based in Dallas, Texas. Beckett Publications produces price guides for a variety of sports collectibles (Beckett's Football, Basketball, and Hockey guides would start in the early 1990s, with Beckett's monthly Racing Guide following in 1996). Market values for non-sports card collectibles such as Pok√©mon Cards and related products are also tracked. Beckett retains a position as Senior Advisor for Beckett Media, but is no longer Editor/Publisher as he was during the 1980s and 1990s. The publishing company became the leading publisher of sports and entertainment market collectible guides and was acquired by Apprise Media in 2005. Personal life Beckett has three children from his first marriage. He is married to the former Diane Burgdorf, daughter of a Dallas car dealer and ex-wife of Sir Mark Thatcher.

Bush and confirmation by the United States Senate. Jimenez served at the Navy after the change in administrations on January 20, 2009 until April 30, 2009 when he resigned to become Vice President and General Counsel at ITT Corporation. As the General Counsel of the Navy, Jimenez managed over 600 attorneys worldwide, helped to oversee the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, and advised senior Navy and Marine Corps officials on litigation, acquisition, fiscal, environmental, property, personnel, legislative, and ethics issues. Early life and career Jimenez, the son of Cuban immigrants Frank and Daisy Jimenez, grew up in Miami, Florida. He is the younger brother of Marcos Daniel Jimenez, former United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, in charge of 230 federal prosecutors. Jimenez graduated with honors in 1987 from the University of Miami, where he majored in biology. He received his law degree in 1991 from the Yale Law School, where he was Notes Editor of the Yale Law Journal and won the Harlan Fiske Stone and Benjamin N. Cardozo Prizes for best oral argument and best brief, respectively, in the school's moot court competition. He also received an MBA degree in 2005 from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and an M.A. degree in National Security and Strategic Studies in 2009 from the Naval War College. Before his career in government, Jimenez practiced at the Miami law firm of Steel Hector and Davis LLP, specializing in complex commercial litigation and white collar criminal defense, including federal class action, antitrust and product liability litigation, and representation of clients under federal grand jury and agency investigation. He joined the firm in 1992 and became a partner in 1998. Previously, he served a one-year clerkship in the chambers of Judge Pamela Ann Rymer of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Pasadena, California. Jimenez is admitted to the Bars of Florida, the District of Columbia, and New York. Government work Before his appointment as General Counsel of the Navy, Jimenez served in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) as the Deputy General Counsel (Legal Counsel) for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the seniormost litigation counsel for the Department, coordinating with the White House Counsel's Office, Department of Justice and other agencies on pressing legal issues. He advised senior DoD officials on a wide variety of legal questions and supervised the Office of Legislative Counsel and the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals. Prior to his service in the OSD, Jimenez was the Principal Deputy General Counsel of the Navy, the alter ego to the General Counsel of the Navy. Before his 2004 arrival at the Pentagon, Jimenez served as the Chief of Staff at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). As Chief of Staff, he assisted Secretary Mel Martinez in managing more than 9,000 employees and an annual budget surpassing $30 billion. He helped supervise HUD's many homeownership and affordable housing programs for low- income Americans, as well as programs for the homeless, elderly, people with disabilities, and people living with AIDS. Jimenez also assisted in supervising the Department's interactions with the White House, sister agencies, public officials, industry groups and the general public. Jimenez arrived in Washington in 2002 from Florida, where he served for nearly four years in the Executive Office of Governor Jeb Bush, beginning with his gubernatorial transition in 1998. For nearly three years, he served as Deputy Chief of Staff, with oversight duties at various times for the Departments of Transportation, Business and Professional Regulation, Environmental Protection, Community Affairs, Elder Affairs, and Health, as well as the Agency for Workforce Innovation and the Division of Emergency Management.

Introduction to Jane Ellen Harrison's \\"A Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion\\", xv In Germany, by about 1795, there was a growing interest in Homer and Greek mythology. In G√∂ttingen Johann Matthias Gesner began to revive Greek studies and a new humanistic spirit. His successor, Christian Gottlob Heyne, worked with Johann Joachim Winckelmann, and laid the foundations for mythological research both in Germany and elsewhere. Heyne approached the myth as a philologist and shaped the educated Germans' conception of antiquity for nearly half a century, during which ancient Greece exerted an intense influence on intellectual life in Germany.F. Graf, Greek Mythology, 9 Comparative approaches Max M√ºller is regarded as one of the founders of comparative mythology. In his Comparative Mythology (1867) M√ºller analysed the \\"disturbing\\" similarity between the mythologies of \\"savage\\" races with those of the early European races. The development of comparative philology in the 19th century, together with ethnological discoveries in the 20th century, established the science of myth. Since the Romantics, all study of myth has been comparative. Wilhelm Mannhardt, Sir James Frazer, and Stith Thompson employed the comparative approach to collect and classify the themes of folklore and mythology. In 1871 Edward Burnett Tylor published his Primitive Culture, in which he applied the comparative method and tried to explain the origin and evolution of religion.D. Allen, Structure and Creativity in Religion, 9 * R.A. Segal, Theorizing about Myth, 16 Tylor's procedure of drawing together material culture, ritual and myth of widely separated cultures influenced both Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell. According to Robert Segal, however, Campbell‚Äôs \\"romantic view of myth is the opposite of a rationalist view, one epitomized by the Victorian anthropologists Edward Tylor and James Frazer\\".R. Segal, The Romantic Appeal of Joseph Campbell, 332-335 J.F. del Giorgio has added a new turn to the comparative approach, insisting in The Oldest Europeans about present Greek myths being generated by the clash between a Paleolithic European population and the incoming Indo-European tribes. Max M√ºller applied the new science of comparative mythology to the study of myth, in which he detected the distorted remains of Aryan nature worship. Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski emphasized the ways myth fulfills common social functions. Claude L√©vi-Strauss and other structuralists have compared the formal relations and patterns in myths throughout the world. Evans himself, while studying the Minoan world, drew regularly on Egyptian and Near Eastern evidence for comparison, and the discovery of the Hittite and Ugaritic civilizations has uncovered texts as well as monuments which offer comparative material for ritual and mythology.W. Burkert, Greek Religion, 24 Psychoanalytic interpretations Sigmund Freud put forward the idea that symbolic communication does not depend on cultural history alone but also on the workings of the psyche. Thus Freud introduced a transhistorical and biological conception of man and a view of myth as an expression of repressed ideas. Dream interpretation is the basis of Freudian myth interpretation and Freud's concept of dreamwork recognizes the importance of contextual relationships for the interpretation of any individual element in a dream. This suggestion would find an important point of rapprochement between the structuralist and psychoanalytic approaches to myth in Freud's thought.R. Caldwell, The Psychoanalytic Interpretation of Greek Myth, 344 Carl Jung extended the transhistorical, psychological approach with his theory of the \\"collective unconscious\\" and the archetypes (inherited \\"archaic\\" patterns), often encoded in myth, that arise out of it. According to Jung, \\"myth-forming structural elements must be present in the unconscious psyche\\".C. Jung, The Psychology of the Child Archetype, 85 Comparing Jung's methodology with Campbell's theory, Segal concludes that \\"to interpret a myth Campbell simply identifies the archetypes in it. An interpretation of the Odyssey, for example, would show how Odysseus‚Äôs life conforms to a heroic pattern. Jung, by contrast, considers the identification of archetypes merely the first step in the interpretation of a myth\\". For Jung, myth is no more about gods than about the physical world; it is about the human mind and must be read symbolically.R.A. Segal, Theorizing about Myth, 69 Karl Kerenyi, one of the founders of modern studies in Greek mythology, gave up his early views of myth, in order to apply Jung's theories of archetypes to Greek myth.F. Graf, Greek Mythology, 38 Origin theories The origins of Greek mythology are an open question. In antiquity, historians such as Herodotus theorized that the Greek gods had been stolen directly from the Egyptians. Later on, Christian writers tried to explain Hellenic paganism through degeneration of Biblical religion. According to the Scriptural theory, all mythological legends (including Greek mythology) are derived from the narratives of the Scriptures, though the real facts have been disguised and altered. Thus Deucalion is another name for Noah, Hercules for Samson, Arion for Jonah etc.T. Bulfinch, Bulfinch's Greek and Roman Mythology, 241 According to the Historical Theory all the persons mentioned in mythology were once real human beings, and the legends relating to them are merely the additions of later times. Thus the story of Aeolus is supposed to have risen from the fact that Aeolus was the ruler of some islands in the Tyrrhenian Sea.T. Bulfinch, Bulfinch's Greek and Roman Mythology, 241-242 The Allegorical theory supposes that all the ancient myths were allegorical and symbolical. According to the Physical theory the elements of air, fire, and water were originally the objects of religious adoration, and the principal deities were personifications of the powers of nature.T. Bulfinch, Bulfinch's Greek and Roman Mythology, 242 Jupiter et Th√©tis by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, 1811. The sciences of archaeology and linguistics have been applied to the origins of Greek mythology with some interesting results. Historical linguistics indicates that particular aspects of the Greek pantheon were inherited from Indo-European society (or perhaps both cultures borrowed from another earlier source), as were the roots of the Greek language. Prominent Sanskritist Max M√ºller attempted to understand an Indo-European religious form by tracing it back to its Aryan, Vedic, \\"original\\" manifestation. In 1891, he claimed that \\"the most important discovery which has been made during the nineteenth century with respect to the ancient history of mankind [...] was this sample equation: Sanskrit Dyaus-pitar = Greek Zeus = Latin Jupiter = Old Norse Tyr\\".D. Allen, Religion, 12 Philologist Georges Dumezil draws a comparison between the Greek Uranus and the Sanskrit Varuna, although there is no hint that he believes them to be originally connected.H.I. Poleman, Review, 78-79 In other cases, close parallels in character and function suggest a common heritage, yet lack of linguistic evidence makes it difficult to prove, as in the case of the Greek Moirai and the Norns of Norse mythology.A. Winterbourne, When the Norns Have Spoken, 87 Archaeology and mythography, on the other hand, has revealed that the Greeks were inspired by some of the civilizations of Asia Minor and the Near East. Adonis seems to be the Greek counterpart ‚Äî more clearly in cult than in myth ‚Äî of a Near Eastern dying god. His name is related to the Semitic invocation \\"adon\\" (Lord) and appears in other cultures as Dumuzi, Tammuz or Attis. Cybele is rooted in Anatolian culture, and much of Aphrodite's iconography springs from the Semitic goddesses Inanna, Ishtar and Astarte.R.A. Segal, A Greek Eternal Child, 64 The theogonic myths current in the Near East in the second millennium BC, such as the myth of Anu, Kumarbi, and Teshub, contain significant stories of generational conflict. Meyer Reinhold argues that \\"such Near Eastern theogonic concepts, involving divine succession through violence and generational conflicts for power, found their way ‚Äî the route is not certain ‚Äî into Greek mythology. Our prime source is the great theogonic poem of Hesiod\\".M. Reinhold, The Generation Gap in Antiquity, 349 Parallels between the earliest divine generations (Chaos and its children) and Tiamat in the Enuma Elish are also possible.L. Edmunds, Approaches to Greek Myth, 184 Aphrodite and Adonis, Attic red-figure aryballos-shaped lekythos by Aison (c. 410 BC, Louvre, Paris). In addition to Indo-European and Near Eastern origins, some scholars have speculated on the debts of Greek mythology to the still poorly understood pre-Hellenic societies of Greece, such as the Minoans and so-called Pelasgians. This is especially true in the case of chthonic deities and mother goddesses. Historians of religion were fascinated by a number of apparently ancient configurations of myth connencted with Crete: the god as bull -- Zeus and Europa; Pasipha√´ who yields to the bull and gives birth to the Minotaur; agrarian mysteries with a sacred marriage (Demeter's union with Iasion) etc. Crete, Mycenae, Pylos, Thebes and Orchomenus figure so large in later Greek mythology.W. Burkert, Greek Religion, 23 For some, the three main generations of gods in Hesiod's Theogony (Uranus, Gaia, etc.; the Titans and then the Olympians) suggest a distant echo of a struggle between social groups, mirroring the three major high cultures of Greek civilization: Minoan, Mycenaean and Hellenic. Martin P. Nilsson, Professor of Classical Archaeology, worked on the structure, origins and relationships of the Indo-European languages, and concluded that all great classical Greek myths were tied to Mycenaen centres and were anchored in prehistoric times.M. Wood, In Search of the Trojan War, 112 Nevertheless, according to Walter Burkert, the iconography of the Cretan Palace Period has provided almost no confirmation of all these theories; nothing points to a bull, sexual symbols are absent and a single seal impression from Knossos showing a boy beneath a sheep is regarded as a scant evidence for the myth of Zeus' childhood.

The pic compiler translates this description into concrete drawing commands. Pic is a procedural programming language, with variable assignment, macros, conditionals, and looping. The language is an example of a little language originally intended for the comfort of non-programmers in the Unix environment (Bentley 1988). Pic was first implemented, and is still most typically used, as a preprocessor in the troff document processing system. The pic preprocessor filters a troff document, replacing diagram descriptions by concrete drawing commands, and passing the rest of the document through without change. A version of pic is included in groff, the GNU version of troff. GNU pic can also act as a preprocessor for TeX documents, emitting its own tpic DVI specials, which aren't as widely supported as those of other TeX drivers (like PostScript). Arbitrary diagram text can be included for formatting by the word processor to which the pic output is directed, and arbitrary post-processor commands can also be included. Dwight Aplevich's implementation, DPIC, can also generate postscript or svg images by itself, as well as act as a preprocessor. The three principal sources of pic processors are GNU pic, found on many Linux systems, and dpic, both of which are free, and the original AT&T; pic.

The prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. History Maidstone Prison is one of the oldest penal institutions in the United Kingdom, having been in operation for over 200 years. Originally serving as a county jail, Maidstone was converted to a prison during the 1740s. During his visits to the prison, reformer John Howard reported poor living conditions at the prison including overcrowding and poor ventilation. However, conditions would remain unchanged until a reconstruction of the prison took place under the supervision of Daniel Asher Alexander, who had worked on the construction of Dartmoor Prison, lasting from 1811 until its completion in 1819 at a cost of ¬£200,000. Also involved in the design of Maidstone Prison was Kent architect John Whichcord Snr, who was Surveyor to the County of Kent from the 1820s. Mr Whichcord is probably best known for designing the Kent County Lunatic Asylum in the 1830s, also in Maidstone, and similarities between the two buildings are apparent. Constructed using Kentish Ragstone from a local quarry, the original design of the prison was intended to house 552 prisoners, including 62 female inmates. The first 141 prisoners arrived in March 1819. Over the next decade, additions to the prison were made including a courthouse in 1826 as well as individual cells, dayrooms, courtyards and offices attributed to suggestions made by Howard. Other reforms later included a strictly enforced segregation of prisoners by offence and the general improvement of living conditions such as improving the water supply, sanitation and ventilation systems, many of these renovations were made with prison labour over the course of the century. By the late 20th century, the only remaining signs of the original prison are the large and small roundhouses, the Weald Wing, the Administrative Block, the Training Complex, the Visits Building and the perimeter wall. Reggie Kray married Roberta Jones in Maidstone prison on 14 July 1997 Jonathan King was an inmate from 2001-2005. In August, 2007 Weald Wing was closed when Legionella bacteria was discovered in the water supply. Approximately 80 prisoners were dispersed to other prisons. At the end of January, 2009 it was announced that the prison would become a sex offenders' unit. Present-day Maidstone accommodates foreign national prisoners convicted of a range of offences; many are deported at the end of their sentence.

The vest is is currently the new FSBE II system, and has replaced the FSBE AAVs. It features PALS webbing, making it MOLLE compatible and allowing the attachment of various pouches or accessories. Two versions of the vest are available known as the \\"Land\\" and the \\"Maritime\\" versions. The vest consists of front and rear panels with pockets for BALCS or SPEAR cut soft armor panels and standard issue SAPI (Small Arms Protective Insert) plates. This gives the wearer up to NIJ Level IV protection on front and back and Level IIIA protection on the sides. On the lower rear side of the front of the vest there are two quick-releasable buckles for attaching groin protection. The wearer's sides are covered by an external cummerbund which is also covered with PALS webbing. The vest body is constructed of 1000 Denier Cordura Nylon and the interior is lined with heavy duty mesh to aid in cooling the wearer. The difference between the ‚ÄúLand‚Äù and ‚ÄúMaritime‚Äù versions is how the outer cummerbund is attached at the front and where the quick-release handle is located. Both comes with an internal cummerbund which overlaps across the stomach and is secured with Velcro. The \\"Maritime\\" version has a solid center panel and two side flaps with Velcro panels underneath of them. Each side of the cummerbund attaches to the Velcro on its corresponding side. The release handle is located at the top of the front panel near the wearer's neck which allows ambidexstrous use. This version provides the wearer with a wide, uninterrupted section of webbing on the center of the vest which allows pouches for multiple magazines to be placed on the center of the body for easy access. On the Land version the external cummerbund wraps around and overlaps over the user's stomach and is secured under a single center flap rather than the two side flaps of the \\"Maritime\\" version. The release handle on the \\"Land\\" vest is located on the left side of the front panel, just above where the cummerbund wraps around. This version breaks up the amount of continuous webbing on the user's front, but allows the vest to be fitted with a different cummerbund which has additional pockets for 6x8\\" side plates. The addition of these plates can bring the vest of to full Level IV protection for the entire torso, meaning the vest can stop rifle rounds from all sides instead of just front and back. Additionally, both the \\"Land\\" and \\"Maritime\\" versions can be fitted with extra coverage for the neck, biceps, deltoids, and, as previously mentioned, the groin area. These inserts provide up to Level IIIA coverage except for the groin which has a Level IV plate available. Critiques of this vest include its weight when fully loaded with plates and inserts, its lack of \\"breathing\\" due to its coverage, and difficulty donning the vest by oneself. There are khaki, ranger green, olive drab, black, coyote brown, UCP, and multicam color variations for the CIRAs, and the manufacturer number for consumer goods does not have a contract number. The MAR-CIRAS is the armor carrier of choice for USSOCOM (BALCS-R). Many SEAL operators use the Khaki Maritime MAR-CIRAS. The United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance operators use the CIRAS (Both Land or Maritime versions) during different missions. Release feature Both versions of the CIRAS come with a quick- release cable; with a pull of the handle, a steel cable holding the cummerbund and shoulder straps in place is released, allowing rapid removal of the vest. This is utilized for decontamination procedures, medical access needs, and water emergencies where the weight of the vest can cause the wearer to drown unless removed quickly. This last reason was the primary initiative behind the design of quick release vests as a helicopter crash in 1999 led to several US Marines drowning because they could not remove all their layers of armor and load bearing equipment fast enough. This is also described under the Full Spectrum Battle Equipment Amphibious Assault Vest entry, which the CIRAS was developed from. At the time this vest was introduced, it was a unique feature, but it has since been replicated on a number of other vests. The current vest uses a simplified system to attach and release the vest components, making reassembly quicker and easier. The pull handle for the vest is itself secured with a Velcro loop to prevent accidental pulling.

NY 158 is a two-lane highway for all of its length. Route description NY 158 through the town of Guiderland NY 158 begins east of the village of Altamont at NY 146 in the town of Guilderland. NY 158 proceeds winding north alongside the Black Creek as a two-lane road through several residences, crossing over the Bozen Kill. Now paralleling the Bozen Kill, the route continues north through Guiderland as the waterway merges into the Watervilet Reservoir. At the northern end of the reservoir, NY 158 intersects with US 20 (Western Avenue). After US 20, the route continues north through Guiderland, winding through town as it gains the moniker of Guiderland Avenue. In the hamlet of Parkers Corners, NY 158 continues past some residences and an intersection with Old State Road. A short trek to the north and NY 158 crosses the line from Albany County to Schenectady County. NY 158, now in the town of Rotterdam, continues north into the hamlet of Pine Grove as Guiderland Avenue. In Pine Grove, NY 158 bends northeast at a junction with the eastern terminus of NY 406 (Giffords Church Road). Crossing over a railroad line, the road passes a small housing complex before crossing under the New York State Thruway (I-90). After the Thruway, NY 158 enters the hamlet of Rotterdam, where Guiderland Avenue becomes a two-lane residential street. Crossing over another railroad grade, NY 158 turns north at Sunrise Boulevard. Just five blocks to the north of Sunrise, Guiderland Avenue intersects with NY 7 (Curry Road). This intersection serves as the northern terminus of NY 158 while the route continues north as County Route 160. History NY 158 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It initially began at NY 146 east of Altamont in Guilderland and followed its modern alignment north to Curry Road (now NY 7) in Rotterdam. From there, it continued north along Guilderland Avenue into Schenectady, where it ended at Broadway (then-NY 7). NY 7 was realigned to bypass downtown Schenectady on Curry Road. At the same time, NY 158 was truncated southward to end at the rerouted NY 7. The former alignment of NY 158 between Curry Road and the Schenectady city line remained state-maintained as a reference route until April 1, 1980, when ownership and maintenance of the highway was transferred from the state of New York to Schenectady County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. It was subsequently designated as County Route 160 by Schenectady County.

He pioneered studies on global climate and calculated temperature of Earth considering simple physical model of equilibrium in which the incoming solar radiation absorbed by the Earth's system is balanced by the energy re-radiated to space as thermal energy. Budyko's groundbreaking book, Heat Balance of the Earth's Surface, published in 1956, transformed climatology from a qualitative into a quantitative physical science. These new physical methods based on heat balance were quickly adopted by climatologists around the world. In 1963, Budyko directed the compilation of an atlas illustrating the components of the Earth's heat balance. Life Ethnically Belarussian, Budyko earned his M.Sc. in 1942 from the Division of Physics of the Leningrad Polytechnic Institute. As a researcher at the Leningrad Geophysical Observatory, he received his doctorate in physical and mathematical sciences in 1951. Budyko served as deputy director of the Geophysical Observatory until 1954, as director until 1972, and as head of the Division for Physical Climatology at the observatory from 1972 until 1975. In that year he was appointed director of the Division for Climate Change Research at the State Hydrological Institute in St. Petersburg. Studies He was the first researcher to discuss the Pleistocene megafauna extinction. Budyko published a study in 1969 outlining Arctic amplification, describing how Arctic sea ice decline affects Arctic temperatures due to the ice-albedo feedback. The study attracted significant attention since it hinted at the possibility for a runaway positive feedback within the global climate system. In 1972, Budyko calculated that a mere few tenths of one percent increase in solar radiation input could melt the icecaps. Moreover, his models similarly indicated that a 50% increase in atmospheric CO2 would melt all the polar ice, whereas reduction of the gas by half \\"can lead to a complete glaciation of the Earth.\\" Due to the rising use of fossil fuels, at some time \\"comparatively soon (probably not later than a hundred years)... a substantial rise in air temperature will take place.\\" As early as 2050, Budyko calculated, the Arctic Ocean's ice cover could be melted away entirely.AIP. The Discovery of Global Warming January 2012 In 1987 he published a study on Anthropogenic Climate Change, together with Yuri Izrael, dealing with climate impact assessment, concluding that parts of the northern hemisphere would gain some benefit from climate change. However, to the end of his life in 1998 he gave a speech titled, \\"Global Climate Warming and its Consequence\\" when accepting the Blue Planet Prize 1998, and concluding, \\"On balance, it is very difficult to conclude with higher accuracy whether the projected global warming would be globally beneficial to human society or not.\\" In 1990, Budyko was co-author of section five of the IPCC First Assessment Report, writing about equilibrium climate change and its implications for the future, and was a peer reviewer for the report. Climate engineering Budyko is believed to have been the first, in 1974, to put forth the concept of artificial solar radiation management with stratospheric sulfate aerosols if global warming ever became a pressing issue.An overview of geoengineering of climate using stratospheric sulphate aerosols This climate engineering proposal has been dubbed \\"Budyko's Blanket\\" in his honor.Nature‚Äôs View of Geoengineering Bibliography *–ò—Å–ø–∞—Ä–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≤ –µ—Å—Ç–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —É—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏—è—Ö, –õ., 1948; *–ê—Ç–ª–∞—Å —Ç–µ–ø–ª–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ –±–∞–ª–∞–Ω—Å–∞, –õ., 1955 (—Ä–µ–¥.); *–¢–µ–ø–ª–æ–≤–æ–π –±–∞–ª–∞–Ω—Å –∑–µ–º–Ω–æ–π –ø–æ–≤–µ—Ä—Ö–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏, –õ., 1956. *Andronova, Natalia G.

Beach handball is a team sport where two teams pass and bounce or roll a ball, trying to throw it in the goal of the opposing team. The game is similar to standard handball, but it is played on sand instead of on a solid floor. Because the ball loses most of its bounce on sand, there is little to no dribbling, and players instead perform more passing as the rules of traveling still applies. Matches are played as best two-out-of-three sets. If teams are tied at the end of a regular set then the teams play for a golden goal. If the teams are tied at the end of 2 sets then the teams will participate in a tie breaker. The tie break involves a goalie throwing the ball to their own player while that player attempts to score one-on-one with the opposing goalie. During regular play, if the goalkeeper scores a goal this counts as two points, compared to a normal goal scored by an outfield player which counts as 1 point. Creative or spectacular goals, such as 360 degree jumps and alley- oops, are awarded with two points, as well as in-flights and 6 meter throws. The official rules of Beach Handball were internationally codified in 2002.

As the co-founder of the Michigan State Agricultural Society, John Clough Holmes spearheaded the movement to build an agriculture college in Michigan.Beal 1915, p. 401. Holmes Hall, the home of the Lyman Briggs College, is named in his honor. After moving to Detroit at age 26, Holmes married into a merchant family. He later got involved in both the Detroit Horticultural Society and the Board of Education. In 1849, his background in horticulture and education led him to co-found the Michigan State Agricultural Society, a group dedicated to establishing a state-funded agricultural college in Michigan. Holmes spent the next six years drafting legislation and gaining support for his cause, and in 1855, the Michigan state governor signed a bill establishing the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan. Holmes was keenly involved with the details of the Agricultural College, influencing everything from the purchase of land for the campus, layout of the buildings, and even the placement of the chairs and tables. Once the College opened, he assumed the role of treasurer and later Professor of Horticulture. By 1861, Holmes had fallen out of favor with the other College administrators, and retired to his home in Detroit. Nevertheless, he continued to support and visit the college until his death in 1887. Biography Born in Salem, Massachusetts, John Clough Holmes moved to Michigan in 1835, and gained employment in a Detroit merchant store. Within five years he had married his boss's daughter, and soon became a partner in the family business. Holmes served as president of the Detroit Horticultural Society in 1847. The following two years he was a member of the Board of Education of Detroit. Then in 1849 he co-founded the Michigan State Agricultural Society.Beal 1915, pp. 400‚Äì401. The Michigan State Agricultural Society immediately assumed a lofty goal to foster the establishment of a state-funded agricultural college in Michigan. Holmes, who served as secretary of the Agricultural Society from 1849 to 1857, was also the college's most tenacious proponent. In conference with his fellow society members, he drafted a bill that would create the college. Significantly, Holmes (among others) vehemently admonished that this college be independent of both the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and the Normal School in Ypsilanti, for he \\"feared that agricultural studies would not receive the attention needed to survive and thrive\\" at those schools. Holmes spent the next five years gathering supporters for his grassroots movement, traveling at his own expense to gather petition signatures from across the state. On January 14, 1855, Holmes went to the state capital of Lansing to lobby the legislature for an agricultural college. He spent the next four weeks championing the bill he wrote and cementing support in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Though many legislators supported the basic concept of a state-funded agricultural college, there was strong opposition from University of Michigan president Henry Tappan, who wanted the agriculture program to be part of his school. Nevertheless, Holmes prevailed. On February 12, 1855, Michigan Governor Kinsley S. Bingham signed Act 130, establishing the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan, the school that would become Michigan State University. The final draft of the bill held only two significant differences from the one that Holmes presented: that the purchase price not exceed US $15 per acre, rather than the $25 Holmes desired; and that the site must be within ten miles (16 km) of Lansing, a provision added to silence the various factions that wanted the new college built in their own backyards.Kuhn 1955, p. 10. Holmes' work had only begun: Act 130 put the Agricultural Society wholly in charge of selecting the site for the Agricultural College. In June 1855, Holmes and the society's executive committee visited nine sites of offered land, including some near the present towns of Holt, Millett, DeWitt, and Haslett.Kuhn 1955, p. 11. As a result of the low stipulated price of $15 per acre, all of the sites were uncleared land, and many were quite untenable for a campus. Eventually, Holmes wrote the proposal to purchase the Burr farm, located three miles due east of the capitol. He also included a second proposal, outlining both the college's organization and \\"specific appointments for a staff.\\"Kuhn 1955, pp. 11‚Äì12. Lautner 1978, p. 18. The State Board of Education approved the site purchase in July 1855, but months later had proven unable to make any progress in deciding on basics for the college‚Äîincluding what buildings it might require. The Board turned to Holmes, who had continued to acquaint himself with the site by making some preliminary surveys. After some consideration, he reported back to the Board that the school required two main buildings: a combination classroom and office building, and a dormitory. Thus, John C. Holmes is the man responsible for the design of both College Hall and the original dormitory, now known as Saints' Rest. In addition, although Professor Harold W. Lautner (who, as the official Director of Campus Planning from 1945 to 1969, was a direct successor to Holmes) makes a point of noting that \\"who proposed the sites for these first buildings is not answered in any record,\\" he concurs that Holmes' ubiquitous hand makes it unlikely that anyone else made that decision.Lautner 1978, p. 19. The buildings were completed, and the first classes commenced in May 1857. As the College began operations, Holmes was appointed its treasurer. Showing that no decision was small enough to escape his view, he is said to have \\"supervised the placing of chairs and tables in College Hall.\\"Kuhn 1955, p. 15. The college's 200-volume library was donated by the Michigan State Agricultural Society‚Äîcuriously, this meant that Holmes (as secretary of the society) had conveyed the library to himself (as treasurer of the college). In addition to treasurer, Holmes was appointed as the school's first superintendent of horticulture, responsible for campus planning and planting. This title was used alternately with Professor for a short period. On February 2, 1858, the Horticulture Professorship was suspended, ostensibly for financial reasons (as well as the fact that the wild condition of the land hardly warranted a full-time horticulturalist as yet). Even so, Holmes was allowed to continue residing in one of the original on- campus Faculty Row houses until the end of the term.Lautner 1978, p. 23. Then, on March 8, 1859, Holmes was asked to resign as treasurer, and he complied. Some time in that year or the one following, he was appointed once again as Superintendent of Horticulture, guiding students in planting the College gardens and improving the grounds. Through 1861 he continued to be listed in the college catalog under various titles including Professor of Horticulture, Secretary, and Treasurer.Kuhn 1955, p. 30. Beal 1915, p. 401. Legacy In 1861, a major reorganization of the College transferred control from the Board of Education to the newly formed Board of Agriculture. Holmes was \\"not retained despite the urging of his colleagues and the unquestioned spiritual debt which the College owed him.\\"Kuhn 1955, p. 65. Holmes returned to the Detroit area, lived another twenty-six years, and remained active in his community. Although he continued to be, as President T. C. Abbot wrote circa 1883, \\"a not infrequent and always welcome visitor at the college, and one of its warmest friends,\\" Holmes never again held any official position at the College. There is no known explanation for this change of fortune, but as Lautner wrote, \\"clearly there were troubles here other than financial ones that are not suggested in the minutes.\\"Lautner 1978, p. 24. Professor Lautner contrasts Holmes' legacy with that of John Harvard, whose donation of a modest library and four hundred British pounds led to a major university that bears his name, implying that MSU's debt to Holmes is far greater. Professor William J. Beal called him \\"the most important agent\\" of the school, while President Abbot said, \\"To no one man is the College so much indebted as John Clough Holmes.\\" One hundred years after the founding, Madison Kuhn's high regard for Holmes was clear, using as the frontispiece of his book a painting clearly meant to signify the exact moment of the Agricultural College's genesis with an almost mythological glow.Kuhn 1955, p. ii. Finally in 1965, MSU named a new six story modernist residence hall after Holmes. The building still stands to this day, and is home to the Lyman Briggs College.

Frequency range is 88.1 - 88.3 - 88.5 - 88.7 MHz Belkin TuneCastII FM Transmitter with a modified antenna connected to an iPod music player. A personal FM transmitter is a low-power FM radio transmitter that broadcasts a signal from a portable audio device (such as an MP3 player) to a standard FM radio. Most of these transmitters plug into the device's headphone jack and then broadcast the signal over an FM broadcast band frequency, so that it can be picked up by any nearby radio. This allows portable audio devices to make use of the louder or better sound quality of a home audio system or car stereo without requiring a wired connection. They are often used in cars but may also be in fixed locations such as broadcasting from a computer sound card throughout a building. Being low-powered, most transmitters typically have a short range of 100‚Äì300 feet (30‚Äì100 metres), depending on the quality of the receiver, obstructions and elevation. Typically they broadcast on any FM frequency from 87.5 to 108.0 MHz in most of the world, 76.0 - 95.0 MHz for Japan, 65.0 - 74.2 MHz for Russia, and 88.1 to 107.9 MHz in the US and Canada.  Uses  Personal FM transmitters are commonly used as a workaround for playing portable audio devices on car radios that don't have an Auxiliary \\"AUX\\" input jack or Bluetooth audio connectivity. They are also used to broadcast a stationary audio source, like a computer or a television, around a home. They can also be used for low-power broadcasting and pirate radio but only to a very limited audience in near proximity. They can also be used as a \\"talking sign\\" in real estate sales or similar.  Legality  The legality and maximum permitted power levels or field strengths of these devices varies by country. In 2006 these devices became legal in most countries in the European Union. In the UK Statutory Instrument IR2030/26/2 2011/0401/UK (from December 2011) permits unlicenced use of devices that can be shown to radiate less than 50 nanowatts (-43dBm), on a 0.2 MHz raster in the range 87.5‚Äì108 MHz. Industry Canada permits transmitters that have an output lower than 100 ¬µV/m at (approximately 1 microwatt output). In the United States, Part 15 of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission rules specifies that no license is needed if FM transmitters' Maximum Effective Radiated Power (ERP) of 0.01 microwatts. In Japan, no license is needed for devices with a signal strength of less than 500 ¬µV/m at 3 meters. Devices FM transmitting devices are either operated by connecting to a 3.5 headphone jack source or to a proprietary port of a specific device it is made for. In addition, certain devices such as hands-free car kits, satnavs (e.g. TomTom GO), mobile phones (e.g. some Nokia Nseries) and MP3 players may have FM transmitters built-in. As of 2020 such devices with it built-in are uncommon.

The airport is located 11.5 km (6.2 NM) east-southeast of B√©ziers, near Vias in the H√©rault department. It was previously known as B√©ziers-Vias Airport. The airport handles commercial national flights as well as private, non-regular air traffic. History Because of its comparatively short runway measuring , the airport was unable to benefit from the growth of low-cost flights that had fuelled expansion at other airports in the region (Carcassonne, Perpignan, Montpellier and N√Æmes). For some years there were plans to extend the runway and this work was finally carried out between November 2006 and February 2007. The new runway is now capable of handling the Boeing 737-sized jets favoured by low-cost carriers. Facilities are limited, with departure capacity just capable to accommodate passengers for one Boeing 737. After a runway expansion completed in 2007, daily direct flights to Paris Orly and seasonal services to Bastia were augmented by Ryanair flights to and from Bristol International Airport, which commenced March 2008. On 24 March 2008, it was announced that during the summer months Ryanair flights would also operate to and from London Stansted with a possibility of being extended should they prove successful.Midi Libre, 24 March 2008 Further flights from B√©ziers to London Luton Airport were announced in June 2008 and these commenced twice a week from October 2008.

A portable and expanded version for the PlayStation Vita, entitled Dead or Alive 5 Plus (stylized as Dead or Alive 5+), was released in 2013. The next version, Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate, was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 later in 2013, with an arcade version to follow. A final iteration titled Dead or Alive 5 Last Round was released for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and for the PC via Steam in 2015. A mobile game spin-off Dead or Alive 5 Infinite was also released for Chinese market in 2017. Dead or Alive 5 received generally favorable reviews.

Seeking revenge, Bayman meets Helena aboard Freedom Survivor, as he is suspecting DOATEC's involvement, which Helena denies, suggesting it might be rather the work of Donovan's breakaway faction. She is also approached by Kasumi, who is looking for information regarding Alpha-152. Helena promises her help and arranges a meeting between Hayate and Kasumi, who insists that the pursuit of Alpha is only her fight, rejecting Hayate's offer to aid her. Kasumi then sets out to find more clues about Alpha's whereabouts, going round-the-world while being herself pursued by Ayane. She is also hunted by Bayman, who suspects Kasumi of being the attacker and desires to take her down himself. Helena tells Hayate that she will stop Project Alpha. Meanwhile, at DOATEC's oil platform, Rig is paid a visit by Christie who claims to be a woman from his past coming to \\"test\\" him and who is still working for Donovan. Soon, the platform mysteriously comes under helicopter attack, but Rig and Bass succeed in putting down the fire. It is then revealed it was Helena who has destroyed the TriTower to get revenge on Donovan for the death of her parents during power struggles within the organization. Donovan, his face hidden behind a white porcelain mask, is seen plotting the final stage of his Project Alpha: Phase Four. Donovan orders Lisa, who is still working with him on her research, to bring Miyako, who too is part of their new organization MIST, to a secret laboratory located under the rig. Various characters are shown entering the fifth DOA tournament, which takes place at the platform. Each does it for their own reasons, often to either see once more or to defeat some other character. Usually they join it after either being approached by Zack, who is shown finding, fighting and recruiting them around the world. After Tina decides to return to fighting, her father Bass enters it as well, adopting a ring name of Mr. Strong; eventually, they reunite as a team. While stalking Jann Lee, Leifang eventually confronts him before the tournament and there is sexual tension between them. Hitomi, who still hopes to see Ein (Hayate), advances to the quarterfinals, defeating Mila and then Eliot. During a break, Hitomi meets Hayate, who wishes her good luck. Jann Lee, who had won constructive matches against Leifang and Mr. Strong, defeats her, emerging as the winner from the tournament but not attending the championship award ceremony out of a personal grudge for Rig, whom he lost to in an earlier fight. In Japan, Ryu Hayabusa is approached by Hayate and joins him and Ayane. Helena informs them that the Phase Four will see a mass production of Kasumi clones to sell them to top militaries in the world. Feeling that something is wrong with Kasumi, Hayate orders Ayane to follow her and discover her real intentions. Frustrated with her failure to track down Alpha, Kasumi returns to Helena, demanding to be told the truth, and Helena directs her to the platform. There, Hayate wins the right to follow her from Bayman. Kasumi discovers the lab, with Alpha-152 in it, and appears to destroy her clone. However, she is then attacked and mortally wounded by Hayate and Ayane, and dies in Ryu's arms. This Kasumi is revealed to be merely a clone herself, but Ryu regrets her death anyway. Ryu destroys attacking helicopters (of the kind that attacked the rig earlier), while Hayate is captured in the lab by Rig, who turns out to be working with Donovan. Ryu sends a falcon with a message for the true Kasumi, who has been sheltering with Murumasa all that time; she immediately joins them up at the platform. In the lab, they defeat Rig, who escapes after saying it was a plan to lure them there. Lisa, dismayed to find out that Project Epsilon has been reactivated, frees Hayate. Alpha-152 then appears, taking forms of not only Kasumi but also of Hayate and Ryu, but Hayate and Ayane, Ryu and ultimately Kasumi succeed in destroying her along with the lab. In the epilogue, Kasumi peacefully parts her ways with Hayate and Ayane, as Ryu and Helena watch by, and promises to herself to bring down Donovan for good. In the post-end credits, a conversation between Rig and Donovan (the former revealed to be Donovan's son) is heard. With Rig's success in gathering samples from the fighters, Project Alpha can now move on to Phase Four. Development =Rumours and announcement= By January 2010, rumors about the next Dead or Alive game being developed for the PlayStation 3 had already circulated. GameSpot has listed the game as being exhibited by Koei Tecmo at their booth during the E3 2010. Dead or Alive 5 was officially announced in September 2011 at the Tokyo Game Show on September 14, 2011, for a 2012 release. The first trailer was released in December 2011. Producer Yosuke Hayashi said that the teaser image revealed at the event represents the sensuality that the game is now seeking to portray in a more sophisticated tone. At the time, the game was said to be only \\"15% complete\\".Anoop Gantayat, Dead or Alive 5 is 15% Complete, Andriasang.com, 2011-12-07. Hayashi said that his team was committed to making the environment more involved in the fighting experience than ever before and that they took \\"a lot of inspiration\\" from Naughty Dog's action-adventure game series Uncharted for a creation of the more interactive and destructible stages and the dramatic Cliffhanger events.Xbox World 360, Team Ninja: \\"In Dead or Alive 5, we took a lot of inspiration from the Uncharted series...\\"  Yosuke Hayashi on influences, journalism and next generation consoles, ComputerAndVideoGames.com, 11th November 2012. =Production= The game engine of DOA5 was built from scratch.Brian Ashcraft, Team Ninja Explains How It Researched Breast Physics: ‚ÄúHands On‚Äù, Kotaku, August 16, 2012. To better balance the fighting system, Team Ninja decided to re-examine each of the characters, creating new moves from scratch when needed and carefully refining others. According to Hayashi, the entire project's main concept was a decision to change direction and to focus on the characters' presence instead of on their beauty as in the previous games. They aimed to retain the characters' personalities and characteristics but to make them more lifelike and appealing for the players. In October 2011, the series' official Facebook page announced a contest inviting fans to create and submit their own fighting moves, some of which would be used in DOA5 and their creators would have their names displayed in the game's credits. Regarding an introduction of playable guest characters from the Virtua Fighter series, the characters' key animations were provided by Sega and Team Ninja created some more while working to implement them into the Dead or Alive gameplay system, which uses similar controls but features a different kind of matches. Hayashi said Team Ninja stayed in \\"very close\\" communication with Sega AM2: \\"We got their guidance and feedback, we got them to check for everything we were doing with the characters.\\"Dead or Alive 5: Director wants more cameos, ‚ÄòRyo from Shenmue would be ideal‚Äô, VG24/7, Aug 17, 2012.

Those are definitely going to be in Dead or Alive 5 - it's part of the series, it's part of its history and it's part of why people like it. But we're trying to take a bit more of a mature take on it.\\"Matt Cundy, Dead or Alive 5: Check out the redesigned and more mature Kasumi (in a bikini), GamesRadar, August 29, 2012. After the release, the game's director Yohei Shimbori said they were originally \\"getting feedback from the overseas offices to tone down the sexuality -- to tone down the sexiness of the game, and of the characters.\\" However, the team then changed their decision due to negative feedback from fans who were playing the alpha demo version who demanded bigger breasts. Shimbori said: \\"That was kind of surprising. There's definitely still room for having sexualized aspects,\\" adding that he \\"really tries\\" to take fan feedback into account and to keep an open mind.Christian Nutt, Team Ninja learns to fear its fans, Gamasutra, September 26, 2012. Hayashi himself made a 180 turn from his previous position.

However, several reviews criticized the story mode and aspects of its online features.

A review in Metro pointed to the series as mostly known for its focus on the breasts of the female characters, alleging that \\"the majority of its characters are all impossibly well-endowed women, whose breasts wobble about their chest like a pair of blancmanges [...] portrayed as simpering, personality-free automatons.\\" An attempt during development of Dead or Alive 5 to \\"tone down the sexuality\\" due to outside criticism was reversed due to criticism from long-term fans and testers. In response to criticism of sexualization of female characters, creative director of the games development team pointed to the fact that the game's \\"actions, aesthetics and overall visual presentation is more than obviously set in a light-hearted, over-the- top, candy coated universe\\" and stated that \\"we also don't feel that we are demeaning women.\\" =Sales and awards= In May, Tecmo Koei announced that it aims to sell one million copies of the game.Tecmo Koei Aims To Sell A Million Copies Of Dead Or Alive 5, Siliconera, May 10, 2012.

The program was specifically aimed at youth gun violence as a large-scale problem. The plan is based on the work of criminologist David M. Kennedy. Boston Through the late 1980s and early 1990s, Boston, like many cities in the United States, experienced an epidemic of youth gun homicides. Violence was particularly concentrated in poor inner city neighborhoods including Roxbury, Dorchester, and Mattapan. Youth homicide (ages 24 and under) in Boston increased 230% - from 22 victims in 1987 to 73 in 1990. Between 1991 and 1995, Boston averaged about 44 youth homicides a year. Operation Ceasefire entailed a problem-oriented policing approach, and focused on specific places that were crime hot spots. Focus was placed on two elements of the gun violence problem: illicit gun trafficking and gang violence. At the outset, the strategy was sponsored by the National Institute of Justice and was co-directed by David M. Kennedy, Anthony A. Braga, and Anne M. Piehl of Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. The project, over the course of time, became unique, as it: * Assembled a multi- and interagency working group composed largely of line-level criminal justice practitioners; * Applied qualitative and quantitative research techniques; * Created an assessment of the nature of and dynamics driving youth violence in Boston; * Adapted the intervention after implementation, and continued to do so throughout the program; and * Evaluated the intervention's impact. A core participating agency was defined as one that regularly participated in the Boston Gun Project Working Group over the duration of the project. The participating core agencies included the Boston Police Department; Massachusetts departments of probation and parole; the Suffolk County district attorney; the office of the United States Attorney; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; the Massachusetts Department of Youth Services (juvenile corrections); Boston school police; and gang outreach and prevention streetworkers attached to the Boston Community center program. Other important partners with more intermittent participation include the Ten Points Coalition, the Office of the Massachusetts Attorney General, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Massachusetts State Police. Design on the project began in 1995. It led to what is now known as the Group Violence Intervention (GVI), typically overseen by the National Network for Safe Communities, out of John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, but has also been implemented independently by several jurisdictions. The Boston project launched in 1996 with an innovative partnership between practitioners and researchers. These groups came together to assess the youth homicide problem and implement the intervention, and found a substantial near-term impact on the problem. Operation Ceasefire was based on \\"pulling levers\\" deterrence strategies, which focus criminal justice enforcement on a small number of chronic offenders and gang-involved youth who were responsible for much of Boston's homicide problem. Early impact evaluations suggested that the Ceasefire intervention was associated with significant reductions in youth homicide victimization, shots fired, calls for service, and gun assaults in Boston. Within two years of implementing Operation Ceasefire in Boston, the number of youth homicides dropped to ten, with one handgun-related youth homicide occurring in 1999 and 2000. After a change in supervising personnel within the Boston police department and city government, this first site was abandoned. Youth homicides began to climb again with 37 in 2005 and reaching a peak of 52 in 2010. Findings and results =The Pareto principle in Ceasefire= Research on the Ceasefire method has found a profound and so far invariant connection between serious violence and highly active criminal groups. A typical city-level finding is that groups collectively representing under 0.5% of the city's population will be connected as offenders, victims or both, with between half and three quarters of all homicide in the city‚Äîan example of the Pareto principle: a large proportion of the effects comes from a small proportion of the causes. This is likely to be an underestimate, as only incidents known to be connected to street groups are counted as such; a substantial portion of those not known will also be group connected. In Boston, for example, which at the time had a population of roughly 556,180 people, approximately 1,500 individuals were identified as comprising 61 separate groups. This 0.3% of the population was responsible for 60% of the city's homicides. Similarly, in Cincinnati in 1997, which had an population of about 333,210, between 800 and 1,000 individuals‚Äîless than 0.3% of the population‚Äîwere identified as being group related, and were responsible for 75% of the city's homicides. =Results and impact= Studies of Boston Operation Ceasefire found a 63% reduction in youth homicide. Since then, Operation Ceasefire has evolved into the National Network for Safe Communities' Group Violence Intervention. The Group Violence Intervention (GVI) has been deployed in dozens of cities ‚Äì from Los Angeles to Providence, from Chicago to Nashville ‚Äì over almost 20 years. A 2011 Campbell Collaboration Systematic Review of the strategies, and others related to them, concluded that there is now \\"strong empirical evidence\\" for their crime prevention effectiveness. Stockton's Operation Peacekeeper produced an overall 42% reduction in gun homicide in the city. The Chicago extension of the national Project Safe Neighborhoods initiative, has shown 37% reductions in homicide, while the Lowell, Massachusetts, Project Safe Neighborhoods efforts have produced 44% reductions in gun assault. A 34% reduction in homicide has been recorded in Indianapolis after the launch of the Indianapolis Violence Reduction Partnership. The Cincinnati Initiative to Reduce Violence (CIRV) has shown a 41% reduction in street group member-related homicides.

He was 17 years old when he committed the attacks. He was later arrested and pleaded guilty to defacing the websites of Drug Abuse Resistance Education and RSA Security, as well as unauthorized access of the U.S. Army and Air Force computer systems at four military bases. Moran died of a drug overdose in 2013. The attacks On February 7, 2000, a smurf attack generating over 1 gigabit per second of Internet Control Message Protocol traffic was launched against Yahoo!'s routers, causing their websites to be inaccessible to the world for hours. In a message sent to the CERT Coordination Center, Yahoo! network engineer Jan B. Koum stated that the attackers were \\"above your average script kiddie\\" and \\"knew about our topology and planned this large scale attack in advance.\\" Shortly thereafter, Stanford University's computer security administrator David Brumley began monitoring Internet Relay Chat (IRC) traffic on irc.stanford.edu, which was then a public server on the EFnet IRC network. He discovered discussions about the attack on Yahoo! taking place which led him to believe members of an IRC channel had information about the source of the attacks, and he contacted the FBI to give them transcripts of the IRC chat. Over the following week a series of equally crippling denial-of-service attacks affected many other major internet sites including eBay, Amazon.com, E*TRADE, and Buy.com. A security consultant named Joel de la Garza also began investigating the IRC channel and while he was in the channel, RSA Security's website was redirected to a hacked web server in Colombia with a defaced copy of their home page. The defacement included a reference to David Brumley's nickname on IRC, as he had joined the channel by then in an attempt to gather more information from Moran. De la Garza witnessed this live show of criminal activity and later reported about it to the media. On March 5, 2000, the FBI raided Moran's house and seized his computers. After having so much attention drawn to him, and de la Garza's account of Moran being responsible for defacing RSA's website, the FBI investigated Moran's connections to other website defacements. Eventually they passed this evidence on to the New Hampshire Attorney General's office and Moran was charged as an adult with 7 counts of Class A felony unauthorized access of a computer. One year later, on March 9, 2001, he pleaded guilty to 4 counts of misdemeanor unauthorized access of a computer and was sentenced to 12 months in jail with 3 months suspended as well as ordered to pay $15,000 USD in restitution.

It is based on the Tatar language, but many spoken forms are from Russian language. In some cases one can start a phrase in Tatar and end it in Russian or vice versa. Sometimes only single Russian words are incorporated into Tatar speech, or vice versa. Speaking Tatar words, one can use Russian order of words. The same situation is similar to Bashkir‚ÄìRussian, Chuvash‚ÄìRussian and many other code-switching of Russian minorities. Usage of code-switching  Tatar‚ÄìRussian code-switching is used in several cases: * Russian remains the most common language in urban areas of Tatarstan and other Tatar-populated areas. Several generations of Tatars speak fluent Russian. Often, when constructing a sentence, they use Russian order of words. Being an inflexional language, Russian differs from Tatar, which is an agglutinative language. Even when speaking Tatar conjunctive words that don't exist in Turkic languages are inserted. Even archaic literary language used Arabic and Persian conjunctive words, not all of them are used in modern urban speech. Most of urban Tatars graduated from Russian schools and they have no idea how use some constructions other than in Russian, especially if those constructions were not in use in Tatar-speaking generations. Examples are mojet, naverno, potomuchto, n√ºj√§li (neuzheli), konechno instead of b√§lki, ixtimal, √ß√∂nki, √ßƒ±nlap ta, √§lb√§tt√§ (maybe, probably, because, really?, of course). Brat is used to describe all brothers, although Tatar has two different words for older and younger brothers: ab√≠ and ene correspondingly. * Some concepts have appeared only after Russian language became dominant. Even when those words have counterparts in the literary Tatar language, they are traditionally used in Russian form. Example: Arkhitekturnyj institut instead of Arxitektura institutƒ± (Architure Institute) * Sometimes it is used because many Russian phrases have a unique meaning such as Kuzkina mat (see Tsar Bomb). * Often well known Tatar terms sound much longer than equivalent Russian terms: bezopasnyj -> qurqƒ±nƒ±√ßsƒ±zlƒ±. * The youngest generation use Russian slang words. * Often one who can speak pure Tatar language uses a mix to communicate with the younger generation, as it is more understood by Russians and Tatars who don't speak the native language well. * In areas such as science and technology, where the most of Tatar words are of Russian origin, it is usual to conjunct them with Russian phrases. * In some cases, Tatar words are used in Russian speech to convey a meaning that the Russian word does not have or to provide \\"Tatar color\\" to the sentences. For example, well-known phrases by all Tatarstan communities: Alla birs√§ (God willing), maturƒ±m (my beauty), canƒ±m (my soul): the last two for lovers. The origin of code-switching  Russian was an administrative language, as well as a language of higher education, ever since the fall of Kazan. The literary Tatar language did not have Indo-European roots and was most closely related to several Oriental languages, whose prestige decreased after the Russian revolution whereas knowledge of Russian increased and many Russian words entered into the literary language. Tatar‚ÄìRussian code-switching is based in from the asymmetric bilingualism of Tatars and the introduction of Russian schools, as well as total decline of the national culture as defined by educated Tatars after the 1930s. Another major factor is that the most commonly used language in the cities is Russian. Although there were many Russian-speakers present before the Revolution, more arrived as the result of population transfer in the Soviet Union. Tatars living outside of Tatarstan also code-switch, as there are no Tatar schools outside of Tatarstan.  Written form  The code- switching for a long time had only an oral form, but the popularization of the Internet and SMS it became written. It is written using a Russian or English keyboard without the additional Tatar Cyrillic or Latin characters. The following example is taken from a Tatar hip hop and r'n'b forum:Tatar hip hop & r'n'b forum :She's an angel))) –±–∏–ª–µ—Ç–ª–∞—Ä —Ö–∑, —Å–æ—Ä–∞—à–º–∞–¥—ã–º... :Transliteration (in Russian way): She's an angel))) khz, :Translation: She's an angel))) , > i don't know (—Ö–∑ = —Ö—Ä–µ–Ω –∑–Ω–∞–µ—Ç, what on earth!) : –î–∞ —É–∂ –∞–Ω–≥–µ–ª—Å–∫–æ–µ –ª–∏—á–∏–∫–æ.. –ê –∑–∞–¥–Ω–∏–π –º–æ—Å—Ç—ã —Ç–∞—Ä–∞–ª–º–∞–≥–∞–Ω –º—ã —Å–æ–Ω? –ê–Ω—Å—ã –∫—É—Ä–µ–Ω–º–∏ –±–∏—Ç..–ñ–∏–±–∞—Ä –∞–ª–µ –±–µ—Ä –∏–∫–µ—Å–µ–Ω, –≤ –ø–æ–ª–Ω—ã–π —Ä–æ—Å—Ç :Translteration: Da uj angelskoye lichiko‚Ä¶ A zadniy most , v polnyy rost :Translation: Indeed yes, she has angels' face‚Ä¶ \\"back axle\\"s , the full-length. :–æ–∫–∞–π –º–∞–Ω, –ª–∏—á–Ω—ã–π —è—â–∏–∫—Ç–∞–Ω –∫–∞—Ä–∞ :Okay man,lichnyy yashchik :Okay man, (my) personal box There is seen that there is a grammatical agreement of Russian phrases following the rule of Tatar grammar: zadniy most is Russian for back axle, but Tatar possession suffix is used to is sense of her back axle (zadniy mosty).

Mang√∫ con \\"Los Tres Golpes\\" (Mang√∫ with \\"The Three Hits\\") As in Spain, the largest, most important meal of the day is lunch. Its most typical form, nicknamed La Bandera (\\"The Flag\\"), consists of rice, red beans and meat (beef, chicken, pork, or fish), sometimes accompanied by a side of salad.  Dishes and their origins  The Dominican Republic was formerly a Spanish colony. Many Spanish traits are still present in the island. Many traditional Spanish dishes have found a new home in the Dominican Republic, some with a twist. African and Ta√≠no dishes still hold strong, some of them unchanged. All or nearly all food groups are accommodated in typical Dominican cuisine, as it incorporates meat or seafood; grains, especially rice, corn (native to the island), and wheat; vegetables, such as beans and other legumes, potatoes, yuca, or plantains, and salad; dairy products, especially milk and cheese; and fruits, such as oranges, bananas, and mangos. However, there is heaviest consumption of starches and meats, and least of dairy products and non-starchy vegetables. Sofrito, a saut√©ed mix including local herbs and spices, is used in many dishes. Throughout the south-central coast bulgur, or whole wheat, is a main ingredient in quipes and tipili, two dishes brought by Levantine Middle Eastern immigrants. Other favorite foods and dishes include chicharr√≥n, yaut√≠a, pastelitos or empanadas, batata (sweet potato), pasteles en hoja (ground roots pockets), chimichurris, pl√°tanos maduros (ripe plantain), yuca con mojo (boiled yuca/cassava) and tostones/fritos (fried plantains). Bouillon cubes are used heavily in the preparation of Dominican lunch food. = Ta√≠no dishes = *Casabe ‚Äì bread made out of yuca *Guanimos ‚Äì Guanimo, a dish that can be traced back to Mesoamerica Aztec and Mayan culture, are prepared exactly like tamales or hallaca.

The origin name of this dish is fufu. Still called fufu in parts Africa, Cuba and Puerto Rico and cayeye in Colombia. This is a typical and official national breakfast in the Dominican Republic but can also be served at lunch and dinner. Mang√∫ is typically served with queso Frito (white cheese fried in a pan), Dominican salami, eggs and topped with onions cooked in vinegar. This is also known as los tres golpes (the three hits). = Middle Eastern dishes = *Arroz con almendras y pasas ‚Äì A rice with raisins and almonds brought over by Lebanese. It is usually eaten around Christmas. *Arroz con fideos - Rice cooked with toasted pasta. This dish is eaten with fresh cilantro. In the middle east the dish is eaten with pine nuts, parsley, cilantro and sometimes za'atar. *Kipes or Quipes - Deep fried bulgur roll filled with picadillo. *Ni√±o envuelto ‚Äì Cabbage roll filled with rice. A dish brought over by Lebanese immigrants. = Other dishes = Yanikeiki, also called Yaniqueques *Asopao - Rice, chicken or fish and vegetable soup similar to Gumbo originating in Puerto Rico. Dominicans have a unique asopao adding chicarron de pollo or coconut milk with seafood. *Chen-chen ‚Äì Divide from the Haitian ma√Øs moulin. Cracked corn pilaf cooked in butter, milk, coconut milk, bouillon cubes, an√≠s, nutmeg, onions and garlic. In Haiti an√≠s isn't used instead cheese or smoked herring with thyme, spinach and topped with a avocado-tomato-okra relish is typical. *Soufl√© de Batata con marshmallow ‚Äì Sweet potato casserole is an American dish. Sweet potatoes are roasted with orange juice, sugar, spices and top with marshmallows. In the Dominican Republic sweet potatoes are replaced with batata.

Mofongo is usually served with a chicken broth soup. *Tostones ‚Äì Tostones known as fritos verdes. They are fried green plantain slices served flattened and salted. *Pastelitos ‚Äì They are similar to a hand pie, usually fried and stuffed with beef or cheese. *Yuca con mojo - Boiled or fried cassava with olive oil, garlic, citrus, onions and cilantro.

Locrio a classic style of mixing rice with other kind of meat, this dish is usually served with a salad, yuca or plantains. Moro de guandules con coco a rice, pigeon peas (guandules), and coconut milk dish. Conc√≥n isn't really something you cook on its own. Instead, it's a byproduct of cooking rice. Simply put, it's the layer of burnt hard rice left behind when cooking in a caldero (iron pot). It contains the most flavor. *Soups ‚Äì Dominicans take much pride in their soups and most cooks on the island claim to make the best soup. More than a third of the country‚Äôs total population lives in poverty, and almost 20 per cent are living in extreme poverty. In rural areas poor people constitute half of the population. Soup in the Dominican Republic are easy, cheap and can feed a large number of people. Chambre a legumes, rice and meat stew. Chapea a red or white beans stew with mashed squash, longaniza (sausage), and ripe plantains. Dominican Republic has also adopted many soups like sancocho the Dominican national soup, mondongo (beef tripe soup), crema de cepa de apio (celery root soup). *Spaghetti a la Dominicana ‚Äì Spaghetti cooked with Dominican salami, celery, stewed tomatoes, onions, garlic, tomato sauce, or√©gano, and olives and then afterwards meat sauce is poured.

There are more than six variations in the Dominican Republic the most popular ones being pastel√≥n de platano maduro (yellow plantain casserole) and pastel√≥n de yuca (cassava casserole). Pastel√≥n can be found in other Latin American Countries like Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Panama and Cuba, specially the eastern part which has great Dominican influence. Pastel√≥n are usually stuffed with ground meat or chicken. *Wasakaka ‚Äì A sauce served on roasted or grilled chicken made from lime juice, parsley, garlic, olive oil, salt and pepper.  Desserts  *Almibar de frutas ‚Äì Fruit cooked in syrup. The most popular is called mala rabia. Guava, sweet plantains, and sweet potato with cinnamon. *Arepa ‚Äì Cornmeal and coconut cake.

Geographical differences  What Dominicans tend to eat depends highly on where they live: whether near the sea or in the interior mountains. In either case, most Dominican meat dishes tend to involve pork, as pigs are farmed quite heavily on the island. Meat dishes tend to be very well cooked or even stewed in Dominican restaurants, a tradition stemming from the lesser availability of refrigeration on the island. Seaside Dominican fishing villages will have great varieties of seafood, the most common being shrimp, marlin, mahi-mahi or dorado, and lobster. Most villagers more commonly dine on cheap, lesser-quality fish, usually stewed with la criolla, a type of rice. Premium seafood tends to be too expensive for the many locals, and is saved for the island's upper class and the tourist resorts. Differences between Dominican cuisine and those of other parts of the West Indies include the milder spicing, which mainly uses onions, garlic, cilantro, cilantro ancho (culantro), aj√≠ cubanela (cubanelle pepper), and oregano. Dominican sofrito is known on the island as saz√≥n.

The revolt is named after the small town of Kazym in the Khanty‚ÄìMansi Autonomous Okrug. Some sources describe the events as \\"Kazym rebellions\\", listing a series of conflicts starting in 1931, with some half-hearted attempts at reconciliation from Soviet side, but culminating in forceful suppression in 1933 and repression in 1934.–ö–∞–∑—ã–º—Å–∫–∏–µ –≤–æ—Å—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—è 1931 - 1934 –≥–≥. - Kazym rebellions of 1931-1934. In the 1930s, the new town of Kazym was established by the government as a \\"cultural base\\". In theory, cultural bases were meant to entice the Khanty people into village life with the benefits of schools, hospitals, stores and other communal conveniences. This effort to collectivise native peoples into manageable communities did see a great many Khanty abandoning their forest homes. Still others were relocated forcibly during the Joseph Stalin years. Additionally, compulsory attendance in boarding schools located in towns such as Kazym meant that Khanty children were removed from traditional homes and, for many years, were forbidden to speak their native tongue or follow their cultural beliefs. This process went alongside the abduction and execution of traditional leaders who were labelled \\"kulaks\\" by the state. Eventually there was a revolt in 1933 by many Khanty with support from the Forest Nenets called the Kazym rebellion. The revolt was centred on the town of Kazym and within several weeks was crushed by the Red Army, which was reported to have slaughtered dozens of villagers and burned their homes. This was the last known conflict with Russia by any of the Siberian tribes. After that, anyone who took part in the Bear Funeral Rites or other celebrations of Khanty culture was subject to 10 years imprisonment. Bear hunting was forbidden and anything connected with Khant culture, such as sacred ground, pagan shrines or burial grounds were destroyed. These laws were only relaxed during the 1980s as part of the glasnost policies of Mikhail Gorbachev.

Without any formal training in winemaking, Draper first gained recognition for his 1971 Monte Bello Cabernet Sauvignon when it placed fifth at the Judgment of Paris wine tasting.G. Taber The Judgment of Paris: California vs France pg 181-182 Simon & Schuster Draper has played a significant role in the history of California wine through his pioneering work in popularizing \\"vineyard- designated\\" wines as well as instigating the resurgence of old vine Zinfandel. Along with Ravenswood Winery's Joel Peterson, Draper is considered one of the most important figures in the history of Californian Zinfandel, rescuing the grape from obscurity and demonstrating its full potential as a serious wine.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 287-291 Harcourt Books 2001 Draper was featured in a short film titled Terroir and directed by Christopher McGilvray which was shown at the 2017 Cinequest Film Festival. Early history An assortment of early Ridge wines made by the MonteBello winery that preceded the establishment of Ridge Vineyards. Born in Evanston, Illinois in 1936, Draper was raised on a farm and exposed to agriculture at an early age. He graduated from The Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut and Stanford University, where he majored in philosophy and first became aware of Ridge Vineyard, which was then owned by a group of Stanford Research Institute engineers. After graduation in 1959, Draper joined the Army where he was stationed at Italy. During that time, in a desire to see the sights from his favorite film La strada, Draper rode through the Italian countryside on a motorcycle, learning about the local culture, cuisine and wine. Following his release from the Army, he spent some time at Sorbonne studying French cuisine and nutrition. On his return to the United States, Draper went to work for at Chateau Souverain in Napa Valley as a cellar assistant with the harvest. The next year, Draper went to Chile as part of a Peace Corps mission where he leased a Chilean winery with Fritz Maytag, a fellow volunteer and friend from Stanford. Using Cabernet vines from local vineyards, Draper got first hand experience with winemaking in a very low-tech environment. During this time he also read many books on winemaking to expand his knowledge of the field. In 1968, he traveled to Bordeaux where he discussed winemaking with the ma√Ætre de chai of Ch√¢teau Latour. The experience gave him the confidence he needed to meet with David Bennion and accept the chief winemaking position at Ridge Vineyards in 1969. Ridge Vineyards An assortment of Ridge wines made by Paul Draper, each with a distinctive \\"no frills\\" style wine label. While Ridge had some success with Cabernet, the mission that Draper was charged with was to make Ridge \\"respectable\\". One of the first tasks that he set about was in modernizing the facilities of a winery that was first built in 1886. He then went to focus on Ridge's Cabernet Sauvignon and became an advocate of the potential of cool climate Cabernet in contrast to the very ripe, highly alcoholic styles that came out of warmer climates. Located in the Santa Cruz Mountains AVA, the high altitude of Ridge's vineyards as well as its proximity to the Pacific Ocean created a cooler climate that was distinctly different from that found in Napa Valley or Sonoma County. Draper also embraced the French wine concept of terroir and began producing single-vineyard wine that was designated on the wine label with the name of that vineyard. As the reputation of his wine grew, consumers soon began to recognize names such as Monte Bello, Picchetti Vineyard, Jimsomare and Geyserville from their vineyard-designated bottlings. The style of Draper's Ridge Cabernets are often compared to more Old World styles like Bordeaux and have been reviewed by critics in favorable comparisons to the wines of the First Growths. That is a style that Draper actively tries to parallel and would often serve blind tastings of his Monte Bello Cabernet with a bottle of Ch√¢teau Latour to get feedback on the differences between the two. Draper retired as the CEO and Winemaker of Ridge Vineyards in 2016, but remained on as the Chairman of the Board. =Judgement of Paris= The 1971 Monte Bello Cabernet Sauvignon was selected by organizer Steven Spurrier to take part in his 1976 blind tasting that would pit the best of California wines against the best of France's wines. On the tasting notes, Draper describes the 1971 vintage as the first vintage that they were able to achieve balance in the wine with less sugar in the grapes prior to harvest and the benefit of small amounts of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet franc. The wine was fermented dry with extended skin contact and then put through malolactic fermentation and aged in small American oak barrels. The wine was expected to hit its peak after 6 years in the bottle. Prior to the tasting, Spurrier expected the Ridge Monte Bello to be the best performing American red. In the final results it ended up being the fifth best overall red wine (and second best American wine) after Stag's Leap Wine Cellars, Ch√¢teau Mouton Rothschild, Ch√¢teau Montrose and Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion. In the 2006 rematch, the 1971 Ridge was the highest ranked red wine beating out the 1973 Stag's tastings of the same vintage wine as the original competition. A second tasting was held of more recent vintage wine in which the 2000 Monte Bello red wine came in second place behind a 2000 Ch√¢teau Margaux. =Influence on California Zinfandel= In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Zinfandel was primarily a jug wine grape. Draper sensed the potential of the wine if grown in the right spot and with low yields. Prior to his arrival, Ridge had been making some Zinfandel in small quantities, often blended with Carignane and Petite Sirah, but it was never much of a focus. Elsewhere, in California the grape was also drawing little interest from \\"serious\\" winemakers. Remembering the lessons he learned in Europe about the benefits of \\"old vines\\", particularly with keeping low yields, he went looking for some of the oldest vines of Zinfandel that he could find and found several vineyards with plantings from the 1880s-1900s. Over the course of his career he would uncover other \\"ideal\\" spots for Zinfandel including Spring Mountain, Howell Mountain, Dry Creek Valley, Mendocino, Lodi, Paso Robles, Amador County and Geyserville. While many of these areas had long histories of Zinfandel production, most of these areas never received much recognition until Draper and Ridge began using them and touting their terroir with vineyard-designated wines. Winemaking philosophy Charts used during wine making at Ridge Monte Bello. Draper is an advocate of natural winemaking, though Ridge is not a certified organic winery. His view stems from his desire to let the vineyards \\"express themselves\\" and their terroir without over intrusiveness by man. He has been a critic of overly-powerful, over oak and highly alcoholic wines made from excessively ripe fruit, preferring his wines to be more about finesse and balance. He has also been a critic of high wine prices and consumers who purchase wine for speculating purposes rather than to enjoy them. He has been a harsh critic of the UC Davis Department of Viticulture and Enology in their emphasis of more \\"industrial winemaking\\" versus the traditional methods that he prefers. In contrast to other California Cabernets, Draper's wines are normally around 13% ABV which is low even in comparison to Bordeaux wines. Though his wines are often more of a French style, he has preferred to use American oak because they seem to perform better with his wines. Over the years Paul Draper has influenced a number of winemakers, both in California and abroad, with such notable wine personalities as Jean-Luc Colombo counting him as among his favorite non-European winemakers.E.

It was fought between a combined Habsburg- Transylvanian force and the Ottoman Empire near the village of Mez≈ëkeresztes () in northern Hungary. The Ottomans routed the Habsburg-led army but Ottoman casualties were too high for them to pursue. Background On 23 June 1596, an Ottoman Army marched from Constantinopole. Commanded by Sultan Mehmed III, the army marched through Edirne, Filibe (now known as Plovdiv), Sofia, and Ni≈° to arrive at Belgrade on 9 August. On 20 August, the army crossed the River Sava by bridge and entered the Austrian territory of Siren. A war council was called at Slankamen Castle, and it was decided that they would begin a siege on the Hungarian fort of Eger (Erlau). The fort controlled the communication routes between Habsburg Austria and Transylvania, all of whom were in revolt against Ottoman suzerainty. However, news soon arrived that the Austrians had besieged and succeeded in taking over the Castle of Hatvan and had killed all the Ottomans housed there, including the women and children. The Ottoman Army started a siege of the fort of Eger on 21 September 1596, and by 12 October the castle had capitulated. As retaliation for the Hatvan castle massacre, the defenders of this castle were all executed. Not long after, Ottoman command received the report that a mixed army of Austrians and Transylvanians were advancing towards the Ottoman expeditionary force. A war council was conducted under Grand Vizier Damat Ibrahim Pasha. It was decided that the Ottoman army should march out of Erlau castle so as to meet the Austrians at a suitable battle terrain. The Sultan thought that the Ottoman army should disengage and return to Istanbul; it was with great difficulty that he was persuaded to engage the enemy forces. The most realistic troop strength figures seem to be 40,000‚Äì50,000 for the Christian and 80,000‚Äì100,000 for the Muslim army.A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East, Spencer C. Tucker, 2009, p.547The Encyclopaedia of Islam Vol 6 Mahk-Mid p. 1030S.J.Shaw(1976) p.185 The Christian army had 10,000 Austrians, 4,000 Germans, 3,000 reiters, 13,000 Hungarian light cavalry, and 10,000 Transylvanians, plus 15 other European countries for a total of 40,000 men. Battle The Ottoman army marched through several passageways of marshy terrain and reached Ha√ßova (Turkish meaning: Plain of the Cross), exhausted after a long siege and a hard, long march. The two armies faced each other on the plains of Ha√ßova (). The Austrian-Transylvanian army, under the joint command of Archduke Maximillian III of Austria and Prince Sigismund Bathory of Transylvania, was in position in fortified trenches. When the Ottoman army attacked the Austrian trenches, the Battle of Ha√ßova commenced and continued for two days, from 25‚Äì26 October 1596. Early firearms (cannons, muskets) were used extensively in the battle. The Austrians, being entrenched around the old ruined church, succeeded in driving back the Ottoman assaults with a barrage of fire from muskets and 100 cannon. By the second day of battle the Ottoman army appeared to have been defeated. According to the 17th Century Ottoman historian ƒ∞brahim Pe√ßevi: > \\"The Christians broke through the Ottoman army, but the soldiers of the > Islam had not yet felt the defeat. Then, they started to plunder and taking > of booty at the command headquarters of the Ottomans. Under a few flags, a > large group of Christian soldiers attacked the tent where the chests of gold > money of the Ottoman Exchequer were kept. They killed and otherwise > eliminated the Janissary and household cavalry soldiers guarding the State > Treasury. The Christian soldiers got on the Treasury chests of gold coin and > put up their flags of cross over them and started to dance around > them.\\"Translated from Turkish.

Murat Uraz) Pecevi Tarihi (History of Pe√ßevi) Vol.II, Istanbul:Nesriyat > Yurdu, 1968-69 Commander Sultan Mehmed III wanted to flee from the battlefield. However, first he asked for the opinion of his tutor, the high cleric Hoca Sadeddin Efendi, who told the Sultan that he should continue the battle till the end. Heeding this advice, Sultan Mehmed III ordered that the battle should continue. On the second day of the battle, the fighting intensified. Troops from the Austrian army had reached the Sultan's tent, which was surrounded by the viziers and the teachers at the Palace Pages School for protection. While some troops were trying to enter the Sultan's tent, the other Austrian army's soldiers disengaged, in search of booty and plunder instead of continuing the engagement. The Ottoman horse groomers, cooks, tent makers, and camels minders retaliated against the plunderers with whatever arms they could find, including cooks' spoons, blocks of wood, hammers for tent making, adzes, and axes for cutting wood. The Austrians were surprised and retreated in confusion. The cries of \\"the Christian enemy is fleeing\\" were heard by the Ottoman troops still fighting what seemed like a losing battle on the frontline. The boost of morale allowed them to recover the battle. With a major action from the artillery, the Ottoman forces started another attack on the Austrians across the front and outflanked the Austrian-Transylvanian army, routing them.The original history book of Mustafa Naima, in duplicated manuscript form, was called Ravzat el-huseyin fi hulusat ahbar el-hafikeyn (The garden of al-Husayn: Being the choicest of the news of the east and west). It was translated into English in 1733 and it was among the first books printed in Ottoman Turkish script. References here are from the modern new Turkish script edition: Mustafa Naima (ed. Zuhuri Danisman), Naima Tarihi VI Cilt, Istanbul:Zuhuri Danisman Yayinevi, 1967 Aftermath The allegory of the battle of Mez≈ëkeresztes, 1603‚Äì1604, by Hans von Aachen. Soon after victory, Mehmed III appointed Cigalazade Yusuf Sinan Pasha as the new Grand Vizier. He sent an imperial victory proclamation to Istanbul giving the news of the conquering of Eger (Erlau) Castle and the victory at the Battle of Ha√ßova (Keresztes). This reached Istanbul in October and there were public celebrations and public meetings organized in the city. During these celebrations, four galleys full of state-procured sugar from Egypt arrived at Istanbul harbor, which added \\"sweetness\\" to the news of a military victory. Mehmed III was awarded the epithet of 'Conqueror of Egri'. The Sultan's army marched for a month, returning to Istanbul victorious. With the army in place, a great victory procession and many accompanying spectacles were carried out. The poets of Istanbul wrote special works about the victory. In the streets and markets of the city, town-criers were sent to announce that the streets of the city would be decorated. The warehouses and stores were all decorated with 'valuable cloths'. This display of colour all across the city is described in a poem by the poet [Kemal]: > \\"All the shops of the city became colored due to conquerors wishes > Each of which were decorated as if it were the kerchief of the sweetheart‚Äù =Casualties= The Christians lost 23,000, 30,000 or 50,000 men while the Ottomans suffered 20,000‚Äì30,000 casualties.√Ågnes V√°rkonyi: Age of Reform's, 2004.

He is called the \\"Apostle of Hesbaye\\" (partly in the provinces of Brabant and Limburg, Belgium). His feast day is celebrated on 23 November. He was the son of Blessed Adela of the family of the dukes of Austrasia . Devoted from his earliest youth to the service of God, Trudo came to St. Remaclus, Bishop of Li√®ge (Acta Sanctorum, I Sept., 678) and was sent by him to Chlodulph, Bishop of Metz. Here he received his education at the Church of St. Stephen, to which he always showed a strong affection and donated his later foundation. After his ordination he returned to his native district, preached the Gospel, and built a church at Sarchinium, on the River Cicindria. It was blessed about 656 by Theodard of Maastricht, in honour of Sts. Quintinus and Remigius. Disciples gathered about him and in course of time a monastery developed, the later Sint-Truiden Abbey. The convent for women, established by him at Odeghem near Bruges, later also bore his name (Gallia Christiana, Paris, 1887, V, 281) (see Sint-Truiden). Veneration After death he was buried in the church erected by himself. A translation of his relics, together with those of St. Eucherius, Bishop of Orl√©ans, who had died there in exile in 743, was made in 880 by Franco, Bishop of Li√®ge. On account of the threatened inroads of the Normans the relics were later hidden in a subterranean crypt. After the great conflagration of 1085 they were lost, but again discovered in 1169, and on 11 August that year an official recognition and translation was made by Bishop Rudolph III. On account of these translations the dates 5 and 12 August, and 1 and 2 September, are noted in the martyrologies. The Analecta Bollandiana (V, 305) give an old office of the saint in verse. The life was written by Donatus, a deacon of Metz, at the order of his bishop, Angibram (769-91). It was rewritten by Theodoric, Abbot of St Trond (d. 1107).

In England and Wales the poor rate was a tax on property levied in each parish, which was used to provide poor relief. It was collected under both the Old Poor Law and the New Poor Law. It was absorbed into 'general rate' local taxation in the 1920s, and has continuity with the currently existing Council Tax. Introduction The Poor Relief Act 1601 consolidated earlier poor relief legislation and introduced a system of rating property.Council Tax Handbook, Geoff Parsons, Tim Rowcliffe Smith, Tim Smith, (2006), Taylor & Francis The introduction of the poor rate required the authorities, known as a vestry, in each parish to meet once a year to set the poor rate and to appoint an overseer of the poor to collect the rate. The justices of the peace at the quarter sessions had a role in checking the accounts of the poor rate.http://www.vahs.org.uk/vahs/papers/charlesworth.pdf Reform The system of rating was subject to reform, such as excluding property outside of the parish a rate was paid. Because the poor rate was collected and spent locally within a single parish the notion of settlement was confirmed by the Poor Relief Act 1662 to exclude the poor from other parishes. The Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 removed responsibility for collection of the poor rate from the parish vestries. The collection of poor rate continued to be organised by parish, now collected by the poor law guardians for the parish. Although parishes were often grouped into unions, each parish could be set a different rate depending on the expenditure. During the 19th century a number of anomalies in the parish system, for example where parishes were divided into chapelries each acting much like a distinct parish, were corrected. The criteria used by the Poor Law Amendment Act 1866 for areas that should form civil parishes was that they set their own poor rate. =London= The Metropolitan Poor Act 1867 established a metropolitan poor rate to be collected across the area of the Metropolitan Board of Works. The London (Equalisation of Rates) Act 1894 provided that richer parishes in what was now the County of London would subsidise the poor rate of the less wealthy that had higher expenditure. Abolition The system of rating for the poor rate was used as the basis of other rates, such as the general county rate from 1738. The separate poor rate was amalgamated with the local district or borough general rate by the Rating and Valuation Act 1925.Rating and Valuation Act, 1925 The role of parishes and guardians in the setting and collection of rates was abolished by 1930. The districts and boroughs became the rating authorities for setting and collecting rates and this has continuity with the current billing authorities that set and collect Council Tax.

He was very popular in the Soviet Union in the 1970s primarily because of his criminal songs. He sang more than 1,000 songs based on criminal folklore and literature. Severny worked with well-known Russian jazz and restaurant musicians. He recorded more than 80 albums, both solo and orchestral. Early life Severny was born Arkady Dmitrievich Zvezdin in the town of Ivanovo, near Moscow. Contrary to popular belief, in his childhood years he was neither a hooligan nor a poor pupil. He belonged to the so-called \\"golden youth\\" with his father occupying a senior position in the Ivanovo railroad. The young Arkady did well at school, and loved to play the seven-string guitar. Owing to a near-eidetic memory, he could perform a large number of songs. His older sister once gave him a thick copybook filled with song lyrics, including numerous prison songs; he quickly learned this peculiar repertoire and eagerly sang such songs in polite company. After graduating from school in 1957, Arkady left for Leningrad, where he enrolled in the S.M. Kirov Forestry Academy, and participated in amateur musical and theatrical productions, including student ensembles that wrote and performed their own songs written in English in the style of Louis Armstrong. Having become completely engrossed in student amateur art, he did not study very diligently and after each term was on the verge of being expelled. Finally, he had to discontinue his studies for a while and took an academic leave of absence. First recordings Once, in the company of friends, Arkady sang about a dozen songs, which he recorded on tape. In 1963, his first recordings, with a total recording time of 35‚Äì40 minutes, were released. Upon receiving his degree in 1965, he was given an administrative job at SoyuzEksportLes (Wood Export Union). Nevertheless, working in an office environment was of little interest to him; he wanted to sing. In the summer of 1967, Arkady became acquainted with one Rudolf Fuchs, a person who recorded singers and songwriters who played the guitar. Fuchs had the idea of producing the novice's first album in the form of a refined hoax, specifically a non-existent radio program, which was allegedly broadcast on the Soviet airwaves. Severny performed prison songs on the radio at the request of the program's listening audience. The fake radio program turned out to be a major success, due to the provocative nature of the songs that were allegedly performed on Soviet radio. The pseudonym \\"Severny\\" was adopted as a matter of style. In the 1960s, many of the Soviet Union's labour camps were located in the north of Russia. Severny being the Russian word for northern, it fit Severny's carefully cultivated image as a prison singer perfectly. Secondly, the pseudonym served as a cover, since in those years one could actually be sent to prison for giving underground concerts. Popularity In 1968, Arkady was discharged from the Soviet army, where he had served as lieutenant for a year in a helicopter regiment not far from Leningrad. Having demobilized, the singer learned that during the period of his mandatory service, his popularity as a singer had grown considerably. He then received an invitation from producer Sergei Maklakov. Arkady performed his songs throughout an entire evening at Maklakov's residence, resulting in 500 meters of recordings on the now outdated reel-to-reel tape recorder that were quickly disseminated throughout the entire Soviet Union and eventually gave rise to the popularity of the performer's prison songs. It was with great pleasure that music lovers all over the country listened to the singer's slightly hoarse voice performing such revived songs as Roast Chicken, School of Ballet Dance, I Lived in Noisy Odessa, Mother, I‚Äôm In Love With A Pilot, Tram #10 Passed By, and many others. During the recording, Severny would shout interjections such as In Odessa-, Back when I was in Odessa-, and others of the type, and mimicked the style of performance oft found in Odessa‚Äîagain, part of his carefully cultivated image. Many of his listeners actually believed that he was from Odessa. Death On 12 April 1980, Arkady died from a massive cerebral hemorrhage while staying at a friend's house in Leningrad. Due to circumstances which are not entirely clear, the urn containing his ashes disappeared before burial could take place. Therefore, his \\"tomb\\" in Saint Petersburg is in fact a cenotaph. Legacy Severny managed to combine and concentrate practically the entire international lexicon of the \\"prison song\\" genre. Moreover, although it was understood that Severny himself performed as a character, and was not himself a criminal, the genre remained one of the most prominent in the 1970s and 1980s underground scene. It should also be noted that the official culture of the Soviet \\"stagnation\\" period not only had as its foil the light non-conformism coming from the direction of the intelligentsia, but also the dark culture of the criminal world. Because Severny was not recognized by the authorities as a singer, he became a cult figure in the Soviet Union, with the population clamoring to get recordings of his underground concerts. Russian criminal culture thus became an essential integral part of the greater Russian culture.

With the rediscovery of classical antiquity in the Renaissance, the poetry of Ovid became a major influence on the imagination of poets and artists, and remained a fundamental influence on the diffusion and perception of Greek mythology through subsequent centuries. * L. Burn, Greek Myths, 75 From the early years of the Renaissance, artists portrayed subjects from Greek mythology alongside more conventional Christian themes. Among the best-known subjects of Italian artists are Botticelli's Birth of Venus and Pallas and the Centaur, the Ledas of Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, and Raphael's Galatea. Through the medium of Latin and the works of Ovid, Greek myth influenced medieval and Renaissance poets such as Petrarch, Boccaccio and Dante in Italy. In northern Europe, Greek mythology never took the same hold of the visual arts, but its effect was very obvious on literature. Both Latin and Greek classical texts were translated, so that stories of mythology became available. In England, Chaucer, the Elizabethans and John Milton were among those influenced by Greek myths; nearly all the major English poets from Shakespeare to Robert Bridges turned for inspiration to Greek mythology. Jean Racine in France and Goethe in Germany revived Greek drama. Racine reworked the ancient myths -- including those of Phaidra, Andromache, Oedipus and Iphigeneia -- to new purpose.L. Burn, Greek Myths, 75 The rape of Europa (El rapto de Europa), 1772 In the 18th century, the philosophical revolution of the Enlightenment spread throughout Europe. It was accompanied by a certain reaction against Greek myth; there was a tendency to insist on the scientific and philosophical achievements of Greece and Rome. The myths, however, continued to provide an important source of raw material for dramatists, including those who wrote the libretti for Handel's operas Admeto and Semele, Mozart's Idomeneo, and Gluck's Iphig√©nie en Aulide. By the end of the century, Romanticism initiated a surge of enthusiasm for all things Greek, including Greek mythology. In Britain, it was a great period for new translations of Greek tragedies and Homer's works, and these in turn inspired contemporary poets, such as Keats, Byron, and Shelley.L. Burn, Greek Myths, 75-76 The Hellenism of Queen Victoria's poet laureate, Alfred Lord Tennyson, was such that even his portraits of the quintessentially English court of King Arthur are suffused with echoes of the Homeric epics. The visual arts kept pace, stimulated by the purchase of the Parthenon marbles in 1816; many of the \\"Greek\\" paintings of Lord Leighton and Lawrence Alma-Tadema were seriously accepted as part of the transmission of the Hellenic ideal.L. Burn, Greek Myths, 76 American authors of the 19th century, such as Thomas Bulfinch and Nathaniel Hawthorne, believed that myths should provide pleasure, and held that the study of the classical myths was essential to the understanding of English and American literature.Klatt-Brazouski, Ancient Greek and Roman Mythology, 4 According to Bulfinch, \\"The so-called divinities of Olympus have not a single worshipper among living men. They belong now not to the department of theology, but to those of literature and taste.\\"T. Bulfinch (1855). The Age of Fable: Or, Stories of Gods and Heroes, p.11. Sanborn, Carter, and Bazin. In more recent times, classical themes have been reinterpreted by such major dramatists as Jean Anouilh, Jean Cocteau, and Jean Giraudoux in France, Eugene O'Neill in America, and T. S. Eliot in England, and by great novelists such as the Irish James Joyce and the French Andr√© Gide. Richard Strauss, Jacques Offenbach and many others have set Greek mythological themes to music.

It provides all the basic textural and masticatory properties of gum. The actual composition of gum base is usually a trade secret. The FDA allows 46 different chemicals under the umbrella of \\"gum base.\\" The chemicals are posted on their website. These chemicals are grouped into the following categories. * Natural coagulated or concentrated latices of vegetable origin: These include many of the resins such as chicle that were traditionally chewed as gum. It also includes natural waxes like beeswax and latex (natural rubber). * Synthetic coagulated or concentrated latices: These include petroleum-derived polymers such as paraffin and petroleum waxes. It also includes polymers such as butadiene-styrene, vinyl acetate, and polyethylene which were more recently designed and are utilized to maximize elasticity and incorporate other components of the gum base as well as flavors and sweeteners in their chemical matrix. * Plasticizing materials (softeners): These materials generally help to emulsify various chemical components that do not always bind to each other. They are generally medium-sized molecules and are frequently esters of tree resins and rosins. * Terpene resins: This specific subcategory is not fundamentally different from materials in the first two categories except it is a specific substance that can be produced both naturally and artificially. * Antioxidants: The most common antioxidant in gum, BHT, functions by scavenging free radicals (which spoil food) and sequestering them behind its sterically hindering tert-butyl groups. Gum bases for chewing gum are different from those for bubble gum. A bubble gum base is formulated with the ability to blow bubbles; it contains higher levels of elastomers or higher molecular weight polymers for this purpose. Gum bases for use calcium carbonate as a filler, while gum bases for acid flavored gum use talc as a filler, since acids can react with calcium carbonate to produce Carbon Dioxide gas, which is undesirable. Bubble gum usually contains 15‚Äì20% gum base, while chewing gum contains 20‚Äì25% gum base and sugar-free chewing gum contains 25‚Äì30% gum base. Researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign and at Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company are studying the possibility of making gum base with biodegradable zein (corn protein).Time-intensity study of corn zein chewing gum, Large chewing gum manufacturers generally produce their own gum base in-house while small chewing gum producers usually buy gum base from third-party suppliers. Composition and manufacture Another way to categorize the various components of gum bases is by their utility in the base. *Elastomers: provide the elasticity or bounce, and can be natural latexes (e.g. couma macrocarpa (also called leche caspi or sorva), loquat (also called nispero), tunu, jelutong, or chicle which is still commercially produced), or synthetic rubbers (e.g. styrene-butadiene rubber, butyl rubber, polyisobutylene). *Resins: provide a cohesive body or strength, and are most often glycerol esters of gum, terpene resins, and/or polyvinyl acetate. *Waxes: act as softening agents and are most usually paraffin or microcrystalline wax. *Fats: behave as plasticizers and mainly come from hydrogenated vegetable oils. *Emulsifiers: help to hydrate, the most common being lecithin or glycerol monostearate. *Fillers: impart texture and the most commonly used are calcium carbonate or talc. *Antioxidants: protect from oxidation and extend shelf-life; the most common type is BHT. Old gum bases were based on either natural elastomers such as latexes, vegetable gums like chicle, spruce gum, and mastic gum, or alternatively on waxes, e.g. paraffin wax and beeswax, but today synthetic rubbers are preferred.

Cosmetics were also used in ancient Rome, although much of Roman literature suggests that it was frowned upon. It is known that some women in ancient Rome invented make up including lead-based formulas, to whiten the skin, and kohl was used to line the eyes.Olson, Kelly. \\"Cosmetics in Roman Antiquity: Substance, Remedy, Poison.\\" The Classical World Vol. 102, No. 3 (SPRING 2009), pp. 294-298.

An alternative treatment was a poultice of carob grounds and honey, or an ointment made of knotgrass and powdered root of wormwood. To improve breath the ancient Africans chewed herbs or frankincense which is still in use today. Jars of what could be compared with setting lotion have been found to contain a mixture of beeswax and resin. These doubled as remedies for problems such as baldness and greying hair. They also used these products on their mummies, because they believed that it would make them irresistible in the after life. =Middle East= Egyptian cosmetics box from the Bronze Age, Hecht Museum, Haifa Cosmetics were used in Persia and what today is Iran from ancient periods. Kohl is a black powder that is used widely across the Persian Empire. It is used as a powder or smeared to darken the edges of the eyelids similar to eyeliner.Oumeish, OY. \\"The Cultural and Philosophical Concepts of Cosmetics in Beauty and Art Through the Medical History of Mankind.\\" Clinics in Dermatology. 19.4 (2001). Print. After Persian tribes converted to Islam and conquered those areas, in some areas cosmetics were only restricted if they were to disguise the real look in order to mislead or cause uncontrolled desire. In Islamic law, despite these requirements, there is no absolute prohibition on wearing cosmetics; the cosmetics must not be made of substances that harm one's body. An early teacher in the 10th century was Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi, or Abulcasis, who wrote the 24-volume medical encyclopedia Al-Tasrif. A chapter of the 19th volume was dedicated to cosmetics. As the treatise was translated into Latin, the cosmetic chapter was used in the West. Al-Zahrawi considered cosmetics a branch of medicine, which he called \\"Medicine of Beauty\\" (Adwiyat al-Zinah). He deals with perfumes, scented aromatics and incense. There were perfumed sticks rolled and pressed in special molds, perhaps the earliest antecedents of present-day lipsticks and solid deodorants. He also used oily substances called Adhan for medication and beautification. =China= A Beijing opera performer with traditional stage make up Chinese people began to stain their fingernails with gum arabic, gelatin, beeswax and egg white from around 3000 BC. The colors used represented social class: Chou dynasty (first millennium BC) royals wore gold and silver; later royals wore black or red. The lower classes were forbidden to wear bright colors on their nails. Flowers play an important decorative role in China. Legend has it that once on the 7th day of the 1st lunar month, while Princess Shouyang (Â£ΩÈôΩÂÖ¨‰∏ª), daughter of Emperor Wu of Liu Song (ÂäâÂÆãÊ≠¶Â∏ù), was resting under the eaves of Hanzhang Palace near the plum trees after wandering in the gardens, a plum blossom drifted down onto her fair face, leaving a floral imprint on her forehead that enhanced her beauty further. The court ladies were said to be so impressed, that they started decorating their own foreheads with a small delicate plum blossom design. This is also the mythical origin of the floral fashion, meihua zhuang (Ê¢ÖËä±Â¶ù; literally \\"plum blossom makeup\\"), that originated in the Southern Dynasties (420‚Äì589) and became popular amongst ladies in the Tang (618‚Äì907) and Song (960‚Äì1279) dynasties. =Mongolia= Women of royal families painted red spots on the center of their cheeks, right under their eyes.

Ohaguro (black paint) colours the teeth for the ceremony, called Erikae, when maiko (apprentice geisha) graduate and become independent.The geisha would also sometimes use bird droppings to compile a lighter color. =Europe= 1889 painting Woman at her Toilette by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec In the Roman Empire, the use of cosmetics was common amongst prostitutes and rich women. Such adornment was sometimes lamented by certain Roman writers, who thought it to be against the castitas required of women by what they considered traditional Roman values; and later by Christian writers who expressed similar sentiments in a slightly different context. Pliny the Elder mentioned cosmetics in his Naturalis Historia, and Ovid wrote a book on the topic. In the Middle Ages it was thought sinful and immoral to wear makeup by Church leaders, but many women still did so. From the Renaissance up until the 20th century the lower classes had to work outside, in agricultural jobs and the typically light-colored European's skin was darkened by exposure to the sun. The higher a person was in status, the more leisure time he or she had to spend indoors, which kept their skin pale. Thus, the highest class of European society were pale resulting in European men and women attempting to lighten their skin directly, or using white powder on their skin to look more aristocratic. A variety of products were used, including white lead paint which also may have contained arsenic, which also poisoned and killed many. Queen Elizabeth I of England was one well-known user of white lead, with which she created a look known as \\"the Mask of Youth\\".History of Cosmetics. Health-and-beauty-advice.com. Retrieved on 29 September 2010. Portraits of the queen by Nicholas Hilliard from later in her reign are illustrative of her influential style. Pale faces were a trend during the European Middle Ages. In the 16th century, women would bleed themselves to achieve pale skin. Spanish prostitutes wore pink makeup to contract pale skin. 13th century Italian women wore red lipstick to show that they were upperclass.inFlux '99  A Colorful History. Influx.uoregon.edu.

Similar practices were followed by Aboriginals in Australia. Recent history =20th century= Audience applying makeup at lecture by beautician in Los Angeles, c. 1950 During the early 1900s, makeup was not excessively popular. In fact, women hardly wore makeup at all. Make-up at this time was still mostly the territory of prostitutes, those in cabarets and on the black & white screen. Face enamelling (applying actual paint to the face) became popular among the rich at this time in an attempt to look paler. This practice was dangerous due to the main ingredient often being arsenic.Maggie Angelogou. A history of makeup. (London: Studio vista Ltd, 1970), 113. Pale skin was associated with wealth because it meant that one was not out working in the sun and could afford to stay inside all day. Cosmetics were so unpopular that they could not be bought in department stores; they could only be bought at theatrical costume stores. A woman's \\"makeup routine\\" often only consisted of using papier poudr√©, a powdered paper/oil blotting sheet, to whiten the nose in the winter and shine their cheeks in the summer. Rouge was considered provocative, so was only seen on \\"women of the night.\\" Some women used burnt matchsticks to darken eyelashes, and geranium and poppy petals to stain the lips. Vaseline became high in demand because it was used on chapped lips, as a base for hair tonic, and soap. Toilet waters were introduced in the early 1900s, but only lavender water or refined cologne was admissible for women to wear.Maggie Angelogou. A history of makeup. (London: Studio vista Ltd, 1970), 114. Cosmetic deodorant was invented in 1888, by an unknown inventor from Philadelphia and was trademarked under the name Mum (deodorant). Roll-on deodorant was launched in 1952, and aerosol deodorant in 1965. Around 1910, make-up became fashionable in the United States of America and Europe owing to the influence of ballet and theatre stars such as Mathilde Kschessinska and Sarah Bernhardt. Colored makeup was introduced in Paris upon the arrival of the Russian Ballet in 1910, where ochers and crimsons were the most typical shades.Maggie Angelogou. A history of makeup. (London: Studio vista Ltd, 1970), 115. The Daily Mirror beauty book showed that cosmetics were now acceptable for the literate classes to wear. With that said, men often saw rouge as a mark of sex and sin, and rouging was considered an admission of ugliness. In 1915, a Kansas legislature proposed to make it a misdemeanor for women under the age of forty-four to wear cosmetics \\"for the purpose of creating a false impression.\\"Kathy Peiss. Hope In a Jar. (New York: Metropolitan Books, 1998), 55. The Daily Mirror was one of the first to suggest using a pencil line (eyeliner) to elongate the eye and an eyelash curler to accentuate the lashes. Eyebrow darkener was also presented in this beauty book, created from gum Arabic, Indian ink, and rosewater.Maggie Angelogou. A history of makeup. (London: Studio vista Ltd, 1970), 116. George Burchett developed cosmetic tattooing during this time period. He was able to tattoo on pink blushes, red lips, and dark eyebrows. He also was able to tattoo men disfigured in the First World War by inserting skin tones in damaged faces and by covering scars with colors more pleasing to the eye.Maggie Angelogou. A history of makeup. (London: Studio vista Ltd, 1970), 117. Max Factor opened up a professional makeup studio for stage and screen actors in Los Angeles in 1909.Kathy Peiss. Hope In a Jar. (New York: Metropolitan Books, 1998), 58. Even though his store was intended for actors, ordinary women came in to purchase theatrical eye shadow and eyebrow pencils for their home use. In the 1920s, the film industry in Hollywood had the most influential impact on cosmetics. Stars such as Theda Bara had a substantial effect on the makeup industry. Helena Rubinstein was Bara's makeup artist; she created mascara for the actress, relying on her experiments with kohl.Maggie Angelogou. A history of makeup. (London: Studio vista Ltd, 1970), 119. Others who saw the opportunity for the mass-market of cosmetics during this time were Max Factor, Sr., and Elizabeth Arden. Many of the present day makeup manufacturers were established during the 1920s and 1930s. Lipsticks were one of the most popular cosmetics of this time, more so than rouge and powder, because they were colorful and cheap. In 1915, Maurice Levy invented the metal container for lipstick, which gave license to its mass production.Maggie Angelogou. A history of makeup. (London: Studio vista Ltd, 1970), 125. The Flapper style also influenced the cosmetics of the 1920s, which embraced dark eyes, red lipstick, red nail polish, and the suntan, invented as a fashion statement by Coco Chanel. The eyebrow pencil became vastly popular in the 1920s, in part because it was technologically superior to what it had been, due to a new ingredient: hydrogenated cottonseed oil (also the key constituent of another wonder product of that era Crisco Oil).Teresa Riordan. Inventing Beauty. (New York: Broadway Books, 2004). The early commercial mascaras, like Maybelline, were simply pressed cakes containing soap and pigments. A woman would dip a tiny brush into hot water, rub the bristles on the cake, remove the excess by rolling the brush onto some blotting paper or a sponge, and then apply the mascara as if her eyelashes were a watercolor canvas. Eugene Schueller, founder of L'Or√©al, invented modern synthetic hair dye in 1907 and he also invented sunscreen in 1936.L'Or√©al. Loreal.com (8 December 2009). (accessed on 29 September 2010). The first patent for a nail polish was granted in 1919. Its color was a very faint pink. It's not clear how dark this rose was, but any girl whose nails were tipped in any pink darker than a baby's blush risked gossip about being \\"fast.\\" Previously, agricultural workers had only sported suntans, while fashionable women kept their skins as pale as possible. In the wake of Chanel's adoption of the suntan, dozens of new fake tan products were produced to help both men and women achieve the \\"sun-kissed\\" look. In Asia, skin whitening continued to represent the ideal of beauty, as it does to this day. In the time period after the First World War, there was a boom in cosmetic surgery. During the 1920s and 1930s, facial configuration and social identity dominated a plastic surgeon's world. Face- lifts were performed as early as 1920, but it wasn't until the 1960s when cosmetic surgery was used to reduce the signs of aging.Elizabeth Haiken. \\"The Making of the Modern Face: Cosmetic Surgery.\\" Social Research 67, no. 1 (March 2000): 81-97. Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost (accessed March 29, 2015). During the twentieth century, cosmetic surgery mainly revolved around women. Men only participated in the practice if they had been disfigured by the war. Silicone implants were introduced in 1962. In the 1980s, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons made efforts to increase public awareness about plastic surgery. As a result, in 1982, the United States Supreme Court granted physicians the legal right to advertise their procedures.Lee Shu-Yueh and Naeemah Clark. \\"The Normalization of Cosmetic Surgery in Women's Magazines from 1960 to 1989.\\" Journal of Magazine & New Media Research 15, no. 1 (April 2014): 1-22. Communication & Mass Media Complete, EBSCOhost (accessed March 29, 2015). The optimistic and simplified nature of narrative advertisements often made the surgeries seem hazard-free, even though they were anything but. The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery reported that more than two million Americans elected to undergo cosmetic procedures, both surgical and non-surgical, in 1998, liposuction being the most popular. Breast augmentations ranked second, while numbers three, four, and five went to eye surgery, face-lifts, and chemical peels. During the 1920s, numerous African Americans participated in skin bleaching in an attempt to lighten their complexion as well as hair straightening to appear whiter. Skin bleaches and hair straighteners created fortunes worth millions and accounted for a massive thirty to fifty percent of all advertisements in the black press of the decade.Jacob S. Dorman. \\"Skin Bleach And Civilization: The Racial Formation of Blackness in 1920s Harlem.\\" Journal of Pan African Studies 4, no. 4 (June 2011): 47-80. Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost (accessed March 29, 2015). Oftentimes, these bleaches and straighteners were created and marketed by African American women themselves. Skin bleaches contained caustic chemicals such as hydroquinone, which suppressed the production of melanin in the skin. These bleaches could cause severe dermatitis and even death in high dosages. Many times these regimens were used daily, increasing an individual's risk. In the 1970s, at least 5 companies started producing make-up for African American women. Before the 1970s, makeup shades for Black women were limited. Face makeup and lipstick did not work for dark skin types because they were created for pale skin tones. These cosmetics that were created for pale skin tones only made dark skin appear grey. Eventually, makeup companies created makeup that worked for richer skin tones, such as foundations and powders that provided a natural match. Popular companies like Astart√©, Afram, Libra, Flori Roberts and Fashion Fair priced the cosmetics reasonably due to the fact that they wanted to reach out to the masses.\\"Modern Living: Black Cosmetics\\". Time Magazine. 29 June 1970. (accessed 9 February 2010). From 1939 to 1945, during the Second World War, cosmetics were in short supply.Maggie Angelogou. A history of makeup. (London: Studio vista Ltd, 1970), 127. Petroleum and alcohol, basic ingredients of many cosmetics, were diverted into war supply. Ironically, at this time when they were restricted, lipstick, powder, and face cream were most desirable and most experimentation was carried out for the post war period. Cosmetic developers realized that the war would result in a phenomenal boom afterwards, so they began preparing. Yardley, Elizabeth Arden, Helena Rubinstein, and the French manufacturing company became associated with \\"quality\\" after the war because they were the oldest established. Pond's had this same appeal in the lower price range. Gala cosmetics were one of the first to give its products fantasy names, such as the lipsticks in \\"lantern red\\" and \\"sea coral.\\"Maggie Angelogou. A history of makeup. (London: Studio vista Ltd, 1970), 131 During the 1960s and 1970s, many women in the western world influenced by feminism decided to go without any cosmetics. In 1968 at the feminist Miss America protest, protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a \\"Freedom Trash Can.\\" This included cosmetics, which were among items the protestors called \\"instruments of female torture\\" and accouterments of what they perceived to be enforced femininity. Cosmetics in the 1970s were divided into a \\"natural look\\" for day and a more sexualized image for evening. Non-allergic makeup appeared when the bare face was in fashion as women became more interested in the chemical value of their makeup.Maggie Angelogou. A history of makeup. (London: Studio vista Ltd, 1970), 138 Modern developments in technology, such as the High-shear mixer facilitated the production of cosmetics which were more natural looking and had greater staying power in wear than their predecessors.\\"Cosmetics and Personal Care Products Naobay\\". Charles Ross & Son Company. (accessed 7 June 2009). The prime cosmetic of the time was eye shadow, though; women also were interested in new lipstick colors such as lilac, green, and silver.Maggie Angelogou. A history of makeup. (London: Studio vista Ltd, 1970), 135. These lipsticks were often mixed with pale pinks and whites, so women could create their own individual shades. \\"Blush-ons\\" came into the market in this decade, with Revlon giving them wide publicity. This product was applied to the forehead, lower cheeks, and chin. Contouring and highlighting the face with white eye shadow cream also became popular. Avon introduced the lady saleswoman.Maggie Angelogou. A history of makeup. (London: Studio vista Ltd, 1970), 137. In fact, the whole cosmetic industry in general opened opportunities for women in business as entrepreneurs, inventors, manufacturers, distributors, and promoters.Kathy Peiss. Hope In a Jar. (New York: Metropolitan Books, 1998), 5. =21st century= Beauty products are now widely available from dedicated internet-only retailers, who have more recently been joined online by established outlets, including the major department stores and traditional bricks and mortar beauty retailers. Like most industries, cosmetic companies resist regulation by government agencies. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve or review cosmetics, although it does regulate the colors that can be used in the hair dyes. The cosmetic companies are not required to report injuries resulting from use of their products.\\"Cosmetics and your health.\\" womensheatlh.gov.nd.web.4 nov 2004 Although modern makeup has been used mainly by women traditionally, gradually an increasing number of males are using cosmetics usually associated to women to enhance their own facial features. Concealer is commonly used by cosmetic-conscious men. Cosmetics brands are releasing cosmetic products especially tailored for men, and men are using such products more commonly. There is some controversy over this, however, as many feel that men who wear make-up are neglecting traditional gender, and do not view men wearing cosmetics in a positive light. Others, however, view this as a sign of ongoing gender equality and feel that men also have rights to enhance their facial features with cosmetics if women could. Today the market of cosmetics has a different dynamic compared to the 20th century. Some countries are driving this economy: *Japan: Japan is the second largest market in the world. Regarding the growth of this market, cosmetics in Japan have entered a period of stability. However, the market situation is quickly changing. Now consumers can access a lot of information on the Internet and choose many alternatives, opening up many opportunities for newcomers entering the market, looking for chances to meet the diverse needs of consumers. The size of the cosmetics market for 2010 was 2286 billion yen on the basis of the value of shipments by brand manufacturer. With a growth rate of 0.1%, the market was almost unchanged from the previous year. *Russia: One of the most interesting emerging markets, the 5th largest in the world in 2012, the Russian perfumery and cosmetics market has shown the highest growth of 21% since 2004, reaching US$13.5 billion.

He was wounded in action, and was subsequently awarded the Purple Heart, the Combat Medical Badge, and three battle stars.bruceleereview.co.uk From 1950 to 1960 Brodax worked in program development for the William Morris Agency, where he helped develop Your Show of Shows, Pulitzer Prize Playhouse, and Omnibus. He joined King Features Syndicate in 1960 as the head of their then-newly created film and television development department. After Paramount's contract to produce Popeye cartoons ran out in 1957, King Features acquired the television rights. Brodax oversaw the production of over 200 new shorts in 1960‚Äì62, with five different animation studios simultaneously involved. The rapid pace of production, coupled with limited animation due to low budgets, resulted in shorts that are held in low esteem by Popeye fans. Brodax was also the producer of King Features' animated revival of Krazy Kat, as well as Cool McCool, Beetle Bailey, Snuffy Smith, and Casper the Friendly Ghost (1963‚Äì64 segments of The New Casper Cartoon Show). After seeing the Beatles perform on The Ed Sullivan Show, Brodax approached the band's management with the idea of producing an animated series featuring the Fab Four. The series, of which 39 episodes were produced, premiered on September 25, 1965, on ABC. He was later involved in the production of the Beatles' animated film, Yellow Submarine, for United Artists, as producer and co-screenwriter. From 1969 to 1980, Brodax worked as a freelance producer, writer, lyricist and director. He supervised animation for ABC's Make a Wish (1971‚Äì76), and Animals, Animals, Animals (1976‚Äì81).

The school is part of Central Saint Martins, a constituent college of the University of the Arts London. In March 2020 UAL announced that the Drama Centre would close when the current students had completed their courses. It is a member of the Federation of Drama Schools. The school offers BA (Hons) and MA acting courses. History Drama Centre London was founded in 1963 by a breakaway group of teachers and students from the Central School of Speech and Drama, led by John Blatchley, Yat Malmgren and Christopher Fettes. The school was located originally on Prince of Wales Road, Chalk Farm, but moved first to Back Hill, Clerkenwell in 2004, then to its current site at King's Cross in 2011. Since 1999, it has operated as an integral school of Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design, offering degree programmes in acting, directing and screenwriting. A principal aim in the founding of the school was to bring some of the major developments in American and European theatre to the training of British and international actors. Its approach articulates Stanislavski's system, with the movement work of Rudolf Laban and the character typology of Carl Jung to produce a 'movement psychology' for the analysis and development of characters. The school's work also draws on the English tradition, particularly that of Joan Littlewood and Theatre Workshop. These approaches are taught as part of the Western theatrical tradition that began with the Greeks, on which the school places great emphasis.Eva Mekler, Masters of the Stage: British Acting Teachers Talk About Their Craft. New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1989. p.69, p.75. . When the school was founded, it was the only drama school in the country to have an acting class, and is considered to be the first 'Method' drama school in Britain.Eva Mekler, Masters of the Stage: British Acting Teachers Talk About Their Craft p.73-74. Because of its rigour, the school's nickname is \\"Trauma Center\\". Like most drama schools, Drama Centre places a particular emphasis on the work of Konstantin Stanislavski, also training students in improvisation through the Yevgeny Vakhtangov and Jacques Lecoq traditions. The school offers a theatre-based training incorporating both modern and classical texts, and also prepares actors for the demands of screen acting, for which it has a two- year postgraduate course. In September 2005, the school launched their MA Acting course (formerly 'European Classical Acting') which includes residencies at both the Vakhtangov Theatre Institute in Moscow and Imalis Center for Ancient Hellenic Theatre in Epidaurus, Greece. The Drama Centre has always had an international outlook and was the first British drama school to introduce some of the great classics of the European repertoire: Spanish, German and French. Today, this tradition continues and is reflected in a broad spectrum of international links, which includes schools in the USA, Russia and China. In March 2020 UAL announced that they were to close the Drama Centre, following an unfavourable review of the Centre's provision for academic development, quality assurance and equal opportunities. Students currently enrolled will complete their training. Platform Theatre The Platform Theatre is a receiving and producing theatre situated in the Central Saint Martin's complex at King's Cross. The theatre holds 360 in a variety of configurations, has an orchestra pit and a full flying tower and is equipped to high professional standards.

The method is designed to solve some problems with traditional agreements regarding opening leads. It bears some resemblance to Rusinow leads but differences exist. Journalist leads were advocated and publicized in 1964-65 by The Bridge Journal and were written under the name Journalist, which meant that they were a compilation of the opinions of the entire editorial staff of the magazine. (The Bridge Journal ceased publication in 1968 when its editor, Jeff Rubens, joined the editorial staff of The Bridge World.) Not only do Journalist leads attempt to show what the opening leader has, but may also request the partner of opening leader to take specific actions, such as unblocking. There are entirely different leads against notrump and suit contracts. Against notrump contracts: * A = demands unblock or count * K = normal from AK or KQ * Q = from QJ, KQ10, AQ10, or AQJ; demands J * J = from J10; denies higher honor * 10 = from Q109, K109, A109, KJ10 or AJ10 * 9 = from 109; denies higher honor * relatively high spot = discourages continuation of suit * relatively low spot = encourages continuation of suit The proposed advantage of Journalist leads is shown in this deal: When West leads the Jack his partner may win the Ace and switch to another suit. When the 10 is led East will know to return the suit. Rusinow leads from honor sequences are used against suit contracts. If leading a spot card and wanting to give count, the lowest card was led from an odd number of cards and the third best was led from an even number of cards; if leading from a worthless holding and not wanting to give count, the highest card you could afford was led.

William of Champeaux may have been one of his pupils, but this is disputed.William of Champeaux He was one of the first magisters, recognised masters of theology.Edward Grant, God and Reason in the Middle Ages (2001), p. 62. Life He engaged in a controversy with Wenrich of Trier, taking the papal side in the era of the Investiture Controversy. He also attacked Wolfhelm of Brauweiler. Towards the end of his life (1094) he was a reformer at the religious community at Marbach.Fiona J. Griffiths, The Garden of Delights: Reform and Renaissance for Women in the Twelfth Century 92007), p. 33. Writings His Ad Gebehardum liber of 1085 was a comprehensive discussion of kingship, original and much commented on, and clarifying some of the political arguments most centrally used by the papal supporters;Robinson, p. 116 and p. 124. it argued that kingship was an office from which the king could be deposed;Joseph Canning, A History of Medieval Political Thought (1996), p.98. his functionalist analogy was with the position of swineherd, held at the pleasure of the employer.\\"Functionalist\\", \\"swineherd\\": Norman F. Cantor, 1992. The Civilization of the Middle Ages, p.275. This work, dedicated to Gebhard, archbishop of Salzburg, was intended to refute a polemic letter of Wenrich on behalf of Emperor Henry IV, written c.1080-1.Robinson, p. 126 and p.155. A strong supporter of Pope Gregory VII, and the Gregorian revolutionary reforms, Manegold shared with others of his time the view in political thought that secular rulers held their power on the basis of some kind of pact with the ruled.Norman Kretzmann, Anthony John Patrick Kenny, Jan Pinborg (editors), The Cambridge History of Later Medieval Philosophy: From the Rediscovery of Aristotle to the Disintegration of Scholasticism, 1100-1600 (1988), p. 759. Further, when the pact could be considered broken, the oath of allegiance could be considered null, a theory of resistance adapted to aristocratic arguments that had not long previously been topical in Saxony;Canning, p. 105. this theory had been documented in the 1082 Bellum Saxonicum of Bruno of Merseburg.Robinson, p. 128. The argument that in the past bad kings had frequently been deposed, typically with papal involvement, derived from a papal letter of 1075 to Hermann, bishop of Metz.Robinson, p. 125. Manegold's book also contained an account of the life of Gregory VII, reflecting the Vita by John the Deacon of Gregory the Great; this shares details with chronicles of Berthold of Reichenau and Bernold of St Blasien, writing in the part of southern Germany in which Manegold had sheltered after having to leave Alsace.Robinson p. 36. Manegold's sources included St Paul, Jerome, Peter Damian and Bernold;Robinson pp. 124-7. also Pseudo-Chrysostom's Opus Imperfectum in Matthaeum, for the way the 'pact' theory was expressed.Robinson, p. 130. Along with others arguing from the same side, he used arguments from Cyprian, De unitate ecclesiae, in a version (of the fourth chapter) supporting papal primacy.Robinson, p. 172. He opposed the uncritical acceptance by Christians of the views of pagan classical writers. He was a critic of Macrobius, singling out for attack in geography the spherical earth theory of four isolated continents of Crates of Mallus, on theological grounds.W. G. L.

Early life and education Davis was born near Rome, Georgia, attended the University of Georgia (UGA) in Athens and graduated in 1937 with an A.B. and from the UGA School of Law with a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) in 1939. He was admitted to the state bar in 1939 and began practice in Rome. Career =WWII= Beginning in July 1942, Davis served in the United States War Department Headquarters until December 1945. He then served in South America on behalf of the Counter Intelligence Corps. In 1946, Davis moved to Summerville, Georgia, and resumed practicing law. =Political career= On December 27, 1950, Davis became solicitor general of the Rome Circuit and remained in that position until January 1, 1953. Two years later, he was elected judge of the Lookout Mountain Judicial Circuit, serving from January 1, 1955, until his resignation on December 31, 1960. Time in Congress In 1960, Davis won election to the 87th Congress as a Democrat representing Georgia's 7th congressional district. He won re-election to six additional terms in that body until losing his 1974 re-election bid in that year's Democratic primary to conservative activist Larry McDonald. At the time of his loss, Davis had a drinking problem.Barone, Michael; and Ujifusa, Grant. The Almanac of American Politics 1988', p. 303. National Journal, 1987. Davis served as a U.S. Representative from January 3, 1961 to January 3, 1975. Davis' loss to McDonald in 1974 was attributed largely to his perceived lack of opposition to the concept of school busing, in which students were bused to schools outside of their district to facilitate desegregation. Davis, who resided in the more rural part of his district, did not take into account the increasing political force of the northwest suburbs of Atlanta. The fast- growing bedroom communities of Cobb County were filling up with residents who were fleeing mandatory desegregation in urban Atlanta; it was mainly these constituents who supported McDonald and his platform opposing interdistrict school busing. . =Later career and death= Davis returned to practicing law and lived in St. Simons Island, Georgia, at the time of his death on October 3, 1992.

The film was based on a novel of the same name by Jack Davies, who also wrote the screenplay. Plot summary Walter Bradbury (David Niven), is an apparently well-educated, decorated ex-military Englishman. He informs strangers he is the son of a Viscount, a Member of Parliament, a nephew of a General, and walks with a limp and cane due to crashing in the Le Mans 24-hour race. A Japanese ambassador to an unnamed Asian country (\\"Kulagong\\") is attracted to Bradbury's claims of receiving the Military Cross (MC) twice and the Croix du Guerre once during the Second World War and hires Bradbury to tutor to his son, Koichi (played by Kazuhito Ando). Despite Ambassador Kagoyama's growing scepticism Bradbury becomes a trusted companion to the impressionable Koichi. Embellished stories around wartime service dominate the relationship of Bradbury and Koichi, including references to multiple regiments of the British Army, not all of which are real, such as the \\"Brigade of Guards\\", the Parachute Battalion and \\"Parachute Commandos\\". Bradbury describes to Koichi how he single-handedly stormed a German position in France in 1944, how he escaped repeatedly from later German internment, and after the war used his cape to help Queen Elizabeth II cross a puddle, a corruption of the Walter Raleigh aid to Queen Elizabeth in the 16th century. The impressionable Koichi is eager to build on Bradbury's stories. But some painful truths are revealed after Bradbury and the boy are kidnapped by political terrorists. The Ambassador is forced by the host country to deny the kidnapper's demands, which aim to exchange 65 political prisoners for the lives of Koichi and Bradbury. While imprisoned, an ailing Bradbury reveals to Koichi that his limp is due to polio not to wartime service, but nevertheless the two contrive an escape from their hillside prison. Despite Bradbury's frailty bringing his military record into ever more dubious focus the terrorists prove insufficient to the ingenuity of Koichi and Bradbury. After their escape, the film culminates with Bradbury's confession to Ambassador Kagoyama that he was a country schoolmaster during the war. Forgiven for this deception, Koichi is delighted to learn Bradbury will continue as his tutor.

Had he received less than 60% he would have lost retention, which would have made him only the second Illinois judge since 1994 to lose a retention election (and the first since 2004). = Chief Justice of the Illinois Supreme Court = Karmeier became 120th chief justice of the Illinois Supreme Court on October 31, 2016, and was sworn in by Rita Garman, who herself had served as chief justice. According to Herald and Review, \\"In his position, which he'll fill for three years after being elected by his fellow justices on the seven-member court, Karmeier will serve as the top administrator for Illinois' judicial system, which includes more than 900 judges.\\" According to Illinois Lawyer Now, \\"Among other duties, the Chief Justice controls and schedules the Supreme Court's agenda for consideration in conference by the Court during its five formal terms each year, supervises all appointments to Supreme Court committees, serves as chairperson of the Executive Committee of the constitutionally- mandated Illinois Judicial Conference and presents the Court's annual budget request to the General Assembly.\\" His term as chief justice ended October 25, 2019. Controversies =State Farm Insurance appeal= During his candidacy for the office of judge in Illinois, Karmeier managed to raise $4.8 million for his election campaign. This included a direct contribution of $350,000 from the State Farm Insurance group. Other affiliates of State Farm Insurance also paid for Karmeier's campaign. Around that time State Farm policyholders had won $1 billion against State Farm in Avery v. State Farm,Michael Avery et al. v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, Docket No. 91494, (Illinois Supreme Court, 2005) and had prevailed at the intermediate appellate court. The appeal against the damages and award was pending before the Illinois Supreme Court. When Karmeier was elected, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper published an editorial, \\"Big business won a nice return on a $4.3 million investment ... It now has a friendly justice\\". Despite opposition, Karmeier refused to dissociate himself from the case, and the appeal was decided in favor of State Farm Insurance by a majority of 4-2, with Karmeier in the majority. $600 million of punitive damages as well as the award of $457 million against State Farm were reversed. In 2018, State Farm agreed to pay a $250 million settlement in a class-action lawsuit claiming State Farm conspired to defraud 4.7 million current and former customers out of the $1.05 billion award. In 2014, Karmeier was up for a retention vote. A political group of trial lawyers funded a last-minute, $2 million advertising campaign in an unsuccessful effort to unseat him. Karmeier addressed the controversies in a 2014 filing in the Philip Morris case, in which he wrote, \\"When I ran for this office a decade ago, I made only one promise. It was a promise to the People of Illinois and the voters of the Fifth Judicial District that if elected, I would decide every case free of outside influence and based solely on the law and the facts. I have honored that pledge.\\" Personal life Karmeier and his wife, Mary, reside in Nashville, Illinois. They have two children and six grandchildren.

It has 233 member denominations in 110 countries, together claiming 100 million people, thus being the third largest Christian communion in the world after the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. This ecumenical Christian body was formed in June 2010 by the union of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches (WARC) and the Reformed Ecumenical Council (REC). Among the biggest denominations in the WCRC are the Church of South India, Presbyterian Church of East Africa, Presbyterian Church of Korea, Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus, Church of Jesus Christ in Madagascar, Federation of Swiss Protestant Churches, Protestant Church in Indonesia, Presbyterian Church (USA), Evangelical Church of Cameroon, Borneo Evangelical (SIB Malaysia) and the Protestant Church in the Netherlands. Its member denominations on the whole could be considered more liberal than the member denominations of the International Conference of Reformed Churches or the World Reformed Fellowship, which are also large ecumenical Reformed organizations. History The WCRC traces its origins to 1875, with several unifying Reformed organizations emerging in London, England. After a two-day meeting ending on 1 February 2006, Douwe Visser, president of the Reformed Ecumenical Council, and Clifton Kirkpatrick, president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, said in a joint letter to their constituencies, \\"We rejoice in the work of the Holy Spirit which we believe has led us to recommend that the time has come to bring together the work of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches and the Reformed Ecumenical Council into one body that will strengthen the unity and witness of Reformed Christians.\\" After first calling the potential body \\"World Reformed Communion\\", this was modified into \\"World Communion of Reformed Churches\\". A Uniting General Council of the WCRC, bringing the organization into existence, took place from 18‚Äì26 June 2010 at Calvin College, Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States. The council focused on the \\"Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace\\" mentioned in Ephesians as its main theme, setting a tone of true mutual understanding and acceptance amongst member churches and associates, laying aside differences and other issues as they embark on this shared journey with one another as each seeks to discern the will of God and continue their struggle for justice and peace in the world. Work The 2010 Uniting General Council stated that the WCRC should be \\"called to communion and committed to justice.\\" Its two main program offices are thus focused on these aspects, with theological work included with communion. The Theology and Communion office serves as coordinator for official dialogues with other religious organizations, organizes a bi-annual Global Institute of Theology, and brings Reformed theological scholars together for various discussions. The Justice office promotes economic, ecological and human justice, basing much of its work on the Accra Confession, a statement adopted at the 2004 General Council of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches and re-endorsed at the 2010 Uniting General Council. The WCRC also has a General Secretariat which includes the general secretary's office, the communications office and other organizational responsibilities. The current general secretary is Chris Ferguson, a minister from the United Church of Canada. Through the General Secretariat, the WCRC is able to promote dialogue between churches, advocate for causes on a global scale and support the activities of its member churches through various means. The global headquarters of the WCRC are located in Hanover, Germany, with a North American non-profit subsidiary based in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Originally based in Genava, Switzerland, which played host to John Calvin and earned a reputation as the \\"Protestant Rome\\", the group's Executive Committee announced on 8 November 2012, that they would relocate the headquarters to Hanover, Germany, by December 2013, due to overbearing financial strains caused by the high value of the Swiss franc.\\"'Protestant Rome' No More: Reformed Group Abandons Geneva\\" General Secretary Chris Ferguson is a pastor, theologian and social justice advocate from the United Church of Canada. He was elected to the post of general secretary of the World Communion of Reformed Churches in May 2014, entering office on 1 August 2014, for a seven-year term. Previously Ferguson served as the international ecumenical advisor for the Programme for Ecumenical Accompaniment in Colombia (2011‚Äì2014), the World Council of Churches representative to the United Nations (2006‚Äì2010), the World Council of Churches' representative to Jerusalem (2004‚Äì2006) and the executive minister of the United Church of Canada's Justice, Global and Ecumenical Relations Unit and ecumenical officer (2002‚Äì2004).\\"An Interview with Chris Ferguson\\" Members of the communion Red countries are home to at least one member of the World Communion of Reformed Churches This

The annual event is organized by the Krewe of Barkus, a nonprofit organization that promotes adoption and rescue of homeless animals in New Orleans. The Mystic Krewe of Barkus makes fun of the more traditional New Orleans Mardi Gras parades and is the only Mardi Gras \\"krewe\\" in New Orleans created for dogs.  History  The Mystic Krewe of Barkus traces its history to a November 1992 meeting of the Margaret Orr fan club. Orr is a meteorologist for New Orleans television station WDSU and regularly participates in the event as a Mistress of Ceremonies. The parade evolved from a bar prank, as a member of the club hatched the idea for a canine-centered \\"krewe\\" and it took hold. The Krewe was granted official parading status by the city of New Orleans in 1994. The Krewe is reigned over by a canine King and Queen. The King traditionally is a purebred, however, only dogs that once were homeless are eligible to be crowned Queen. Membership in the Krewe of Barkus has grown over the years and now is limited by the city to 1,500 dog participants each year. Registration fees for members are donated to several animal welfare groups, including local chapters of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Throughout the years, the annual event has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars for dog-related nonprofits. The theme of the first Krewe of Barkus Parade was \\"Welcome to the Flea Market.\\" Other themes have included: \\"Jurassic Bark\\"; \\"2001: A Dog Odyssey\\"; \\"Tailtanic: Dogs and Children First\\"; \\"Joan of Bark\\" and \\"007: From Barkus with Love\\".

The population of the ward at the 2011 census was 12,199. However the area dates back to the West Derby hundred district from the 12th century. The area forms part of St Helens town centre. History In the mid 14th century, the manor of Parr was held by William Dacre, 2nd Baron Dacre.Edward Baines, William Robert Whatton, Brooke Herford, James Croston, The history of the county palatine and duchy of Lancaster, vol. 5 (J. Heywood, 1893), p. 2 Parr was one of four townships that joined together, for administrative purposes, to become St. Helens, the others being Sutton, Eccleston and Windle. The Sankey Canal, also known as the Sankey Brook Navigation and St Helens Canal, flows through Parr. When opened in 1757, it ran from close to the mouth of Sankey Brook at the River Mersey along the valley of the Sankey Brook, ending north east of St Helens. Later extensions were made at the Mersey end, firstly to Fiddlers Ferry, then to Widnes, and at the northern end, where it was extended into what became the centre of St Helens. St Peter's Church was built in 1864-65 to the designs of J. Medland Taylor: the stonework is in three different colours and there is a broach spire.Pevsner, N. (1969) Lancashire: 1. Penguin Books; p. 386 The area was overlooked by Bold Power Station across \\"The Moss\\" until the decommissioned station was demolished in the late 90s. Parr has a historical link to the Parr family, most famously represented by Henry VIII's final wife Catherine Parr. Her Father Sir Thomas Parr is known to have owned or rented lands in the area. The family seat was Parr Hall, sited in the Redgate area close to where Frodsham Drive is today. Housing The area of Parr is predominately Council Housing, represented by three main stages of developments. Waring Avenue Estate (developed 1950s / 60s), Concourse Way (colloquially referred to as Cement City in reference to its Pebble Dash rendering) developed in the 1960s, The Pennine Drive Estate developed in the 1950s. Amidst these estates remain the more traditional buildings dating to the 1930s, along with Terrace Housing (1890s onwards) and private developments. \\"The Green Man\\" art installation on The Duckeries in Parr The area succumbed to social problems linked to poverty and an aging population during the 1980s with the collapse of several significant employers in St. Helens. Its housing remains markedly cheaper than other areas of St. Helens due to a commonly perceived stigma of high crime and low education standards. Since 2006 the area, as well as other areas of St. Helens in coordination with Re:new Neighbourhood Management Project, has been targeted for regeneration. Parr was selected for the Pilot scheme and has seen increased funding to local parks and green spaces (The Duckeries for instance, formerly a slag heap, is now in the process of returning the land to its marshy origins, whilst new multi-sporting facilities and park equipment have been added to Gaskell Park and others). In coordination with Helena Housing many council and private properties have been refurbished with new exterior walls, adding a new roof to each property, UPVC doors and double glazing. Other projects have included a government incentive schemes for loft insulation, cavity insulation and secure gated schemes for alley access. Recently a new private housing development of detached houses, terraced homes, and flats was completed along Newton Road and adjacent to the Derbyshire Hill area, with more new-builds developed on Ashtons Green Drive, and Fleet Lane. A panorama of Parr taken from atop The Duckeries local greenspace Transport Parr has three main access routes. The A572 (Newton Road) linking to Newton- le-Willows, the A572 (Parr Stocks Road), a direct route into St Helens town centre and the B5204 towards Burtonwood, Warrington. Education There are currently no non-denominational high schools located in Parr, since the closure of Parr High School. St. Cuthbert's is the only secondary establishment, resting on the junction of Watery Lane and Berry's Lane and the boundary of Sutton (their official address is in fact \\"Sutton\\"). St. Augustine's is located in nearby Blackbrook. After Parr High School closed, many students attend Haydock High School. Sport There are no professional sporting clubs or organisations in Parr. The area boasts a series of playing fields where the local combination football league and rugby fixtures are played as well. One of St. Helens' swimming baths is also located in the area. Blackbrook A.R.L.F.C. is situated in the Blackbrook area of Parr. Notable people The wealthy entrepreneur John Rylands was born in Parr in 1801. Martin Murray also grew up in the area.

Members have to agree with: * The statement that \\"The Scriptures of the Old and New Testament are without error in all that they teach.\\" * At least one of the following historic Reformed Confessions - The Gallican Confession, The Belgic Confession, The Heidelberg Catechism, The Thirty-Nine Articles, The Second Helvetic Confession, The Canons of Dort, The Westminster Confession of Faith, the London Confession of 1689, the Savoy Declaration, or the WRF Statement of Faith. The World Reformed Fellowship wants to promote Reformed thinking, encourage churches and people to embrace Reformed thinking, and to promote evangelisation in the Reformed tradition and to provide forum for dialogue. www.wrfnet.org/web/guest/aboutwrf It is similar in theology to the International Conference of Reformed Churches and more conservative than the World Communion of Reformed Churches. The WRF also differs from them in that it is a fellowship, not a council, and so includes in its membership not only denominations, but individual congregations, pastors and theologians, and non-ecclesial organizations (e.g. theological seminaries). It conceives of its existence as facilitating dialogue and sharing of resources between the different global branches of Reformed Christianity. There are a total of 73 denominational members of the Fellowship and 115 organizational members, as of May 15, 2020.\\"Denominational Members.\\" World Reformed Fellowship. Retrieved 2016-02-28 The Fourth General Assembly of the World Reformed Fellowship was held in Sao Paulo, Brazil in March 2015. This General Assembly approved a new statement of faith which had been completed March 31, 2011. This statement includes twelve articles and was made to accomplish three purposes: # To express accurately the contents of the other historic Reformed confessions which members are required to hold to at least one of. # To apply the Reformed faith to specific issues that the 21st- century church is facing. # To include the voices of Reformed Christians from around the world, since the other confessions were written primarily by Christians in Europe. At its Fifth General Assembly in Jakarta, Indonesia in August 2019, the World Reformed Fellowship published a statement on Reformed theological identity, which provided a narrative description of Reformed theology's origins, methods, characteristics, contexts, and continued relevance.  Denominational members  As of February 2016 there are 72 denominational members. =Africa= * Africa Evangelical Presbyterian Church * Christian Reformed Church in South Africa * Church of England in South Africa * Egliese Protestante Reformee du Burundi * Evangelical Presbyterian Church of Ivory Coast * Evangelical Presbyterian Church of Malawi * Evangelical Reformed Church of the Democratic Republic of Congo * God's Healing Ministry (Lagos, Nigeria) * Greater Grace Ministry, Kampala, Uganda * Igreja Presbteriana de Angola * Mission Voile D√©chir√©, Abidjan, Ivory Coast * Mount Zion Presbyterian Church of Sierra Leone * Presbyterian Church of the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo * Presbyterian Church in Uganda * Presbyterian Church of Sierra Leone * The Protestant Church of Ambohimalaza- Firaisiana, Madagascar * Reformed Churches in South Africa * Reformed Presbyterian Church in Africa (Uganda) * Reformed Presbyterian Church in Africa (Rwanda) * Reformed Presbyterian Church of Uganda * Sudanese Reformed Churches =Asia= * Aashish Presbyterian Church (Zone Koshi, East Nepal) * Biblical Reformed Church of Myanmar * Christian Reformed Church in Nepal * Christian Reformed Church of Sri Lanka * Evangelical Presbyterian Church of Myanmar * General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of the Philippines * Grace Presbyterian Church of Bangladesh * India Reformed Presbyterian Church * Isa-e Church (Bangladesh) * National Capital Region Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church of the Philippines * Peace Church Bangladesh * Presbyterian Church in India * Presbyterian Church of Bangladesh * Presbyterian Church of South India * Presbyterian Free Church of Central India * South India Reformed Churches * Reformed Church of Nepal * Reformed Community Churches in Myanmar * Reformed Evangelical Church of Indonesia * Reformed Evangelical Church of Myanmar * Reformed Presbyterian Church in Myanmar * Reformed Presbyterian Church of India * Smyrna House of Prayer Church in Bangladesh * United Presbyterian Church of Pakistan * United Reformed Church in Myanmar * Christian Reformed Association Malaysia (Malaysia) * Reformed Fellowship Ahmedabad(Gujarat,West India) * The United Church of India(India) =Europe= * Associated Presbyterian Church in Scotland * Evangelical Reformed Baptist Churches in Italy * Free Church of Scotland * Lithuanian Evangelical Reformed Church * Protestant Reformed Christian Church in Croatia * Protestant Reformed Christian Church in Serbia =North America= * Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church (USA) * Christian Reformed Church of North America * L'√âglise R√©form√©e du Qu√©bec * Evangelical Presbyterian Church (USA) * Evangelical Reformed Church in America * International Peacemaking Church of Christ, (Raleigh NC) * National Presbyterian Church of Mexico * Presbyterian Church in America * Reformed Baptist Churches in North America * Reformed Bible Churches of Trinidad and Tobago * Reformed Christian Church of Orlando * United Christian Church and Bible Institute, USA =Oceania= * Grace Presbyterian Church of New Zealand * Presbyterian Church of Australia * Westminster Presbyterian Church (Bull Creek, Australia) =South America= * Evangelical Presbyterian Church of Peru * Presbyterian Church of Bolivia * Presbyterian Church of Brazil * Reformed Church of Latin America * United Church of Christ in Colombia References External links *Homepage of the WRF Category:Presbyterianism Category:International bodies of Reformed denominations Category:Christian organizations established in 2000 ","title":"World Reformed Fellowship"},{"id":"8034542","text":"The Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office) is a component within the United States Department of Justice.

The elaborate and refined Japanese tea ceremony is also meant to demonstrate respect through grace and good etiquette. Etiquette in Asia varies from country to country even though certain actions may seem to be common. No article on the rules of etiquette, nor any list of faux pas, can ever be complete. As the perception of behaviors and actions vary, intercultural competence is essential. A lack of knowledge about the customs and expectations of Asian people can make even those with good intentions seem rude, foolish, and disrespectful. Asian etiquette is often manifested with shades of \\"respect\\", \\"good manners\\" and \\"filial\\", and is highly influenced by Chinese culture.  Bangladesh  Bangladesh society is reserved and very structured. While the norms change or vary, there are timeless customs such as respect for the elders and high regard for family. Old people are always treated with deference and it is considered rude for a young person to be direct and opinionated when talking to elders. Even prolonged eye contact with a senior is considered bad manners. Bangladeshis are modest people and it is not recommended to give excessive praise and can be interpreted as insincere and offensive. Religion serves as a strong influence on etiquette. It is not acceptable for a man to shake hands with a woman if the latter did not offer a hand first. Along with social categorization, religion dictates what is allowed and prohibited. When it comes to business, the etiquette is similar to those found in other Asian countries such as not being direct when communicating one's position or ideas.  Brunei  Southeast Asians are very family-oriented and celebrations are a chance to meet extended kinsmen. In Islamic culture, modesty in dress etiquette is important, such as the tudong (hijab). Etiquette in Brunei is similar to that of Malaysia. China Eating is a dominant aspect of Chinese culture and eating out is one of the most common ways to honor guests, socialize, and deepen friendships. Generally, Chinese etiquette is very similar to that in other East Asian countries such as Korea and Japan, with some exceptions. In most traditional Chinese dining, dishes are shared communally. Although both square and rectangular tables are used for small groups of people, round tables are preferred for large groups. There is a specific seating order to every formal dinner, based on seniority and organizational hierarchy. The seat of honor, reserved for the host or oldest person, is usually the one in the center facing east or facing the entrance. Chopsticks are used instead of forks and knives. In most Chinese restaurants, there is no tip required unless it is explicitly posted. Tea is almost always provided, either in advance of the diners being seated or immediately afterward. A verbal \\"thank you\\" (Ë∞¢Ë∞¢; xiexie) should be offered to the server pouring the tea.  India  Etiquette in India shares many similarities with its South and Southeast Asian neighbours, however there are exceptions found throughout the country. Indonesia Paying respect to elders and obeying teachers are expected among Asian youth, such as shown here in Indonesia. The students quietly listen to their teacher's explanation during their school excursion. It is important to understand that Indonesia is a vast tropical country of sprawling archipelago with extremely diverse culture. Each of these Indonesian ethnic groups have their own culture, tradition and may speak their own language. Each of them may adhere different religions that have their own rules. These combinations made Indonesia a complex mixture of traditions that may differ from one place to another. Indonesia shares many of the points of etiquette with other Southeast Asian nations. As Indonesia has a Muslim majority population, some points of etiquette in the Middle East also apply. Following are some key points of Indonesian etiquette: It is important to be considerate of other people's dignity. Shaming or humiliating people in public is considered extremely rude. Always use your right hand, when shaking hands, offering a gift, handing or receiving something, eating, pointing or generally touching another person. Japan Japanese customs and etiquette can be especially complex and demanding. The knowledge that non-Japanese who commit faux pas act from inexperience can fail to offset the negative emotional response some Japanese people feel when their expectations in matters of etiquette are not met. *Business cards should be given and accepted with both hands. It is expected that the cards will immediately be inspected and admired, then placed on the table in front of the receiver for the duration of the meeting. After the meeting, cards should be stored respectfully and should never be placed in a back pocket. You should not write on a business card. If you want to be taken seriously at a business meeting, you must have business cards. When you get them out, they should be in a card holder ‚Äì not just taken out of your pocket.Scott Reeves Forbes Magazine July 28th, 2005 *It is a faux pas to accept a gift when it is first offered and the giver is expected to offer it multiple times (usually 3 times). Gifts are generally not opened in the giver's presence.Terri Morrison The Business of Gifts *In greeting or thanking another person, it may be insulting if the person of lower status does not bow appropriately lower than the other person. However, foreigners are rarely expected to bow. The level and duration of the bow depends on status, age and other factors.Fodor's Tokyo Etiquette & Behavior *Pouring soy sauce onto rice is considered unusual. *It is less common to pour one's own drink in a social setting. Generally an individual will offer to pour a companion's drink and the companion, in return, will pour the individual's drink. Although if one of you is drinking from a bottle to glass and the other one is drinking just from a glass, it is fine to pour yourself because otherwise you will be in for a long wait. *Blowing one's nose in public is a faux pas. Also, the Japanese do not use their handkerchief for hanakuso, which literally translates as \\"nose shit\\". *For women, not wearing cosmetics or a brassiere may be seen as unprofessional or expressive of disregard for the situation. *Though many Japanese are lenient with foreigners in this regard, it is a faux pas not to use polite language and honorifics when speaking in Japanese with someone having a higher social status. The Japanese honorific \\"san\\" can be used when speaking English but is never used when referring to one‚Äôs self. Japanese place surnames before given names but often reverse the order for the benefit of Westerners. *A smile or laughter from a Japanese person may mean that they are feeling nervous or uncomfortable, and not necessarily happy. *Tipping is rarely practiced in Japan, and can be considered as an insult, except in certain cases, such as tipping your surgeon for an operation, when visiting a high class ryokan, or when dealing with house movers. Consult the locals to be sure what is appropriate. If you can‚Äôt be bothered to wait for change, it is okay to tell a taxi driver to keep it. *In the rituals of a Japanese cremation, the relatives pick the bones out of the ashes with chopsticks, and two relatives may then hold the same piece of bone at the same time. This is the only occasion in which it is acceptable for two people to hold the same item at the same time with chopsticks. At all other times, holding anything with chopsticks by two people at the same time, including passing an item from chopsticks to chopsticks, will remind everyone witnessing this of the funeral of a close relative. Korea Buddhism. Shown here is the Buddha statue at Seokguram Grotto, a National Treasure of South Korea. *The number 4 is considered unlucky, so gifts should not be given in multiples of 4. Giving 7 of an item is considered lucky. *Blowing one's nose at the table, even if the food is spicy, is mildly offensive. If necessary, take a trip to the toilet or at least be very discreet.Airman's Quarterly Spring 2006 *In restaurants and bars, pouring one's own drink is a faux pas. Keep an eye on your neighbors' glasses and fill them if they are empty; they will do the same. To avoid over drinking, simply leave the glass near full. When pouring drinks, hold bottle in right hand, lightly place left hand on forearm near elbow. *When someone of a significantly higher social position pours you a drink, it is considered proper to turn away from that person when you drink it. *A couple kissing each other in public is a faux pas, since it is not seen as modest. *See also Traditional Korean table etiquette. Malaysia * It is considered rude to wear shoes inside a house. One would usually take off shoes outside the house and leave them by the door. * When shaking the hand of elders (such as parents, grandparents or teachers) the younger person is expected to touch the top of the elder's palm with the tip of their nose or forehead to express respect. It is similar to kissing a hand, but only using the tip of the nose or forehead, not lips. This is generally done by the Malays or Malaysian Muslims as a sign of respect. It is considered rude to not \\"Salam\\" a person whether they are visiting you or vice versa. * It is considered improper to show affection (such as kissing) ones partner or spouse in public as it is not showing modesty and piety. * One usually eats with the right hand. * When handing things to people use either your right hand or both hands. Not your left hand. * Girls should dress modestly and not wear revealing clothing. * Malaysia‚Äôs population of Malays, Chinese and Indians all strive to maintain ‚Äúface‚Äù and avoid shame both in public and private situations. Face can be lost by openly criticizing, insulting, doing something that brings shame to a group or individual, showing anger at another person. Face can be saved by remaining calm and courteous, using non-verbal communication to say ‚Äúno‚Äù etc. * You call people who are slightly older than you \\"kak\\" (to a girl, means older sister) and \\"abang\\" (to a boy, means older brother), \\"adik\\" to someone younger than you (Both male and female, means younger sibling) or for people much older than you, or people who are married with children \\"makcik\\" (aunty) or \\"pakcik\\" (uncle). It is respectful to call people by those names rather than their given names, even if they are not related to you. * When greeting a Malaysian ruler or a royal family member, you have to press the palms of your hands together before you while giving a slight bow to show respect. * It is also important to address others according to their honorifics. For example, one must address a teacher as \\"Cikgu\\" and \\"Datuk\\" for someone given the honorary title by a head of state. If unsure, it is better to address a man as \\"Encik\\" (Mister), and a woman as \\"Puan\\" (Mrs or Miss), or \\"Cik\\" (Miss). * The head is considered sacred and should not be touched by hand. * The feet are considered symbolically unclean and should not be used to point to a person or a thing, and the soles of the feet should not be directly exposed to another person when sitting down on the floor. * Please point at someone using the thumb. It is rude to point at someone with the index finger in Malaysia. * To beckon someone, one motions downward with the palm of the hand facing the ground. It is rude to beckon someone with the palm of the hand up. * Never say \\"Oi!\\" when calling out someone. * When speaking to elders, bosses or teachers, one should refrain from using the informal pronoun \\"aku\\" (me) and \\"kau\\" (you) and instead use \\"saya\\". Using \\"aku\\" dan \\"kau\\" in conversations with parents and teachers is a sign of insolence, as the speaker acts as if treating them as equals. Pakistan In urban Sindh and in other parts of the country, men and women usually lower their head and lift their hand to their forehead to make the \\"adab\\" gesture when greeting each other, instead of a handshake. * For respect, when a man is greeting a woman younger or around the same age as him, he must lightly put his hand on the top of her head, as touching the opposite gender is not considered modest. A woman must bow her head lightly and not look the man in the eyes unless the man is younger than the girl. * Women greeting each other usually hug as a sign of respect, whether they know each other or not, and politely ask the guest to sit down while bringing something to eat or drink, even if the guest has no intention of eating. * It is considered respectful to avoid eye contact between man and woman if the two have never met or have no relation with each other, and the woman should keep her head bowed down, especially if the man is in his older years or has higher power in society than her. Philippines Fuerza de Santiago in Manila. The three centuries of Spanish rule left an indelible mark on Filipino customs, art and society. Three centuries of Spanish and 48 years of American rule, as well as the influence of Japan, China, India, Middle East and the West, have added to the classic indigenous etiquette of the Philippines. It has become a unique and particularly formal sense of etiquette concerning social functions, filial piety and public behaviour. Age is an important determinant in social structure and behaviour, dictating the application of honour, precedence, and title. Singapore *In Singapore, a former crown colony of the United Kingdom, many standards of etiquette in Western societies apply. Thailand *The Thais hold their king in very high regard and any sign of disrespect is potentially an imprisonable offence under L√®se majest√© law. There have been a number of people arrested in the past few years, for saying bad things about the Royal Family, including a man who was jailed for 30 years. * Currency, postage stamps, magazines covers and any other items with the king‚Äôs image are never tossed to the ground or treated harshly. Even licking the back of a postage stamp is considered disrespectful. Most especially, these items are never trod upon as it is a sign of utmost disrespect to place one‚Äôs foot above the head of the king. Money or other items dropped accidentally should immediately be picked up and reverently brushed, not trodden on to stop from rolling away.ACIS Travel Talk August 2006 *The head is considered sacred in Thailand and should not be touched by hand. *The feet are considered symbolically unclean and should not be used to point to a person or a thing, and the soles of the feet should not be directly exposed to another person when sitting down on the floor. Turkey *Family members and friends speak to one another using the second singular person sen, and adults use sen to address minors. In formal situations (meeting people for the first time, business, customer-clerk, colleagues) plural second-person siz is used almost exclusively. In very formal situations, double plural second-person sizler may refer to a much- respected person. Rarely, third person plural conjugation of the verb (but not the pronoun) may be used to emphasize utmost respect. In the imperative, there are three forms: second person singular for informal, second person plural for formal, and double plural second person for very formal situations. Thus, the imperative forms of the verb gelmek, \\"to come\\", are gel (second person singular, informal), gelin (second person plural, formal), and geliniz (double second person plural, very formal and not frequently used) *Turkish honorifics generally follow the first name, especially if they refer to gender or particular social statuses (e.g. Name Bey (Mr.), Name Hanƒ±m (Ms.), Name Hoca (teacher or cleric)). Such honorifics are used both in formal and informal situations. A newer honorific is Sayƒ±n, which precedes the surname or full name, and is not gender-specific. (e.g. Sayƒ±n Name Surname, or Sayƒ±n Surname). They are generally used in very formal situations. *Shoes are not worn inside; Turkish people don't want the floor to be stained by soil, sand or dust that may be attached to the soles. Instead, shoes are removed before entering the house, either left outside near the doorstep or placed in the shoe cabinet at the entryway, and often replaced with slippers. Just wearing socks is also acceptable in informal situations. There are also separate slippers used when using a bathroom, due to hygienic reasons. *As beliefs regarding bad luck from open umbrellas indoors are taken seriously by some people, close umbrellas before bringing them inside. Some people believe that passing a knife or scissors directly to a person is bad luck as well. These beliefs are especially common among the elderly. *Hosts typically insist that guests keep eating. One needn‚Äôt eat much, but should at least taste a bit of everything on the table and express appreciation for the taste and quality. *Food or any small favor in general will generally be offered more than once and it is polite to decline it the first time with an expression implying effort to avoid causing inconvenience. *Avoid hand gestures with which one is unfamiliar, such as making a fist with the thumb placed between the middle and index fingers. Many of these are offensive. *Any comment to a person about the appearance of the latter's female relatives or wife might be seen as rude. *If invited to dinner, one is expected to bring something (usually dessert). Avoid bringing alcohol unless sure that the host partakes. If the guest brings food or drinks (as usual) it is customary to offer it in the proper context during the visit. *Friends might greet each other by shaking hands and touching or kissing one or both of the cheeks. This is inappropriate for business. *Before starting to eat at the dinner table, one should wait for the elders to start eating first. But, while drinking water the minors have priority. *Blowing one's nose at a table is met with disgust and frowned upon even if one has cold. As sniffing is also considered rude at a table, it is best to clear one's nose at a toilet as often as necessary. These activities are in general regarded distasteful, and are best kept away from social interactions. *It is usually considered disrespectful to sit legs crossed near one's parents, grandparents, possibly other elderly relatives and in front of one's teacher. When sitting legs crossed, it is offensive to point one's hanging foot at someone, especially someone older or of higher status. Similarly, it is in general rude to show the bottom of one's shoes or feet. *A couple kissing each other is a faux pas in more conservative regions, since it is not seen as modest. *The entire country practices one minute of silence on 10 November at 9:05am. This silence is observed in the memory of the founder of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal.

A garden grown specifically for the purpose of testing and evaluating plants is called a trial garden. Universities, plant breeders, and garden-industry companies frequently have trial gardens, as do many private and public botanical gardens and professional garden journalists. In the classic trials model, newly developed varieties of plants are compared with the closest similar industry standard plant throughout their life cycle‚Äîfrom germination/propagation through maturity, from seed to harvest. By growing new varieties side-by-side with existing ones, researchers can determine whether these new varieties are indeed better, and, if so, in what respects. The Muck Crops Research Station, near Kettleby and Ansnorveldt, in Ontario, Canada, operated by the University of Guelph, tests new species and houses a plant pathology laboratory. Its focus is on plants that grow in muck soil. Any gardener might enjoy creating his or her own trial garden to see which plants fare best in a specific garden environment. Most trials programs are very formal, with scientific designs including random replicated plots to minimise any risk of bias due to placement of plants. The volunteer judges evaluate entries for desirable qualities such as novel flower forms, flower colors, flower show above foliage, fragrance, length of flowering season, and disease or pest tolerances or resistance. Vegetables are judged looking for such traits as speed to harvest, total yield, fruit taste, fruit quality, ease of harvest, plant habit, disease, and pest resistance.

It is named for Bacchus, the Greek god of wine. Bob Hope as King of Bacchus in 1973 Bacchus was the first krewe to have celebrities appear as part of the parade. Past celebrities who have served as Bacchus include: Steve Guttenberg, William Shatner, Lorne Greene, Charlton Heston, Jackie Gleason, Bob Hope, New Orleans' own Pete Fountain, Phil Harris, Henry Winkler, Glen Campbell, Jon Lovitz, and more recently, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Michael Keaton, James Gandolfini, Gerald McRaney in 1992, Harry Connick, Jr. in 1993, Hulk Hogan in 2008, Val Kilmer in 2009, Drew Brees in 2010, Will Ferrell in 2012 and Jim Caviezel in 2017 and Jensen Ackles (whose wife, Danneel Ackles is a native of Lafayette and named after New Orleans' Danneel Street) in 2019. Ron Howard's reign as Bacchus was canceled by the 1979 New Orleans Police Department strike which scuttled all official Mardi Gras parades within the city limits. His Happy Days co-star, Henry Winkler, reigned in 1977. The only non-celebrity to reign as Bacchus was Sgt. John McKeel Jr. (1981), who was held captive for 444 days during the Iran Hostage Crisis with 51 others. Membership The 2009 Krewe included more than 1,350 members, and its parade featured 33 floats, including its signature floats: the Bacchasaurus, a giant dinosaur; the Bacchawhoppa, an equally large whale; Bacchagator, an enormous alligator; and Baccatality, a 3-float procession made up of restaurateurs. The Baccamore', a love themed float, was introduced in 2008. In keeping with tradition, \\"Bacchus beads\\" and doubloons are thrown to revelers from the floats. After a long absence from prime time television, Bacchus returned to the New Orleans airwaves in 2009, when NBC affiliate WDSU produced a five-hour live broadcast of the parade and ensuing party at New Orleans Morial Convention Center. The Bacchus Extravaganza, the krewe's ball, has been held at the Convention Center since 1994 after it was held at the now-demolished Rivergate Convention Center from 1969-93.

It is located south of the centre of Lowestoft and the town's Bascule Bridge and north of Pakefield and Kessingland. Kirkley was originally an independent village and still retains its old fashioned village feel by the seaside but after centuries of urban sprawl and development of the harbour area, is now part of the urban conurbation of Lowestoft. There is a long esplanade where you can walk along the seaside with its various cafes, bars and hotels. The beach is sandy and wide with a pier, fish and chips and seaside beach huts. During the winter dogs are allowed on the beach but during Summer the beach does not allow dogs. In council ward terms, it sits between the wards of Harbour and Pakefield.

A new resort was built by Peto in the then rural parish of Kirkley and along the south beach. Peto sponsored construction of St John's church on the corner of Belvedere Road for the inhabitants of the new town. This was damaged by flooding and finally demolished in 1977. Peto's legacy can be seen throughout Kirkley, including Wellington Terrace and Gardens (where there is a commemorative plaque to him), period seafront houses and Kensington Gardens. Kirkley is also the site of Britten House, a large Victorian house in Kirkley Cliff Road where the composer Benjamin Britten was born in 1913. Redevelopment Kirkley village has an eclectic mix of boho boutique and independent shops and cafes. Kirkley has improved much over the past 12 years with an influx of new residents who are renovating the large Victorian homes. These had been previously turned into flats for council tenants but a conservation order in the area has now stopped degradation of the properties and there has been a formation of residents associations by householders who are intent on improving the reputation of the area. Prices of homes hit rock bottom in 2007 however the area is now fast becoming popular due to Character homes within easy reach of the large sandy beach and village atmosphere.

I.) :The military departments shall... issue appropriate instructions, manuals and regulations in connection with the leadership responsibility for equal opportunity, on and off-base, and containing guidance for its discharge. (para. II.B.1.) :Every military commander has the responsibility to oppose discriminatory practices affecting his men and their dependents and to foster equal opportunity for them, not only in areas under his immediate control, but also in nearby communities where they may live or gather in off-duty hours. (para. II.C.) The directive empowered commanding officers to use economic power to influence local businesses. With the approval of the Secretary of Defense, the commanding officer could declare an area off-limits to military personnel. Aftermath The first non-military establishment was declared off-limits in 1967. In 1970, the requirement for commanding officers to obtain prior permission from the Secretary of Defense was lifted. A commanding officer could now declare housing areas off limits to military personnel under his command.Heather Antecol and Deborah Cobb-Clark, \\"Racial and Ethnic Harassment in Local Communities,\\" October 4, 2005, 8, available online, accessed December 30, 2017 References Category:United States Department of Defense doctrine Category:African-American history of the United States military Category:History of civil rights in the United States Category:20th- century military history of the United States Category:Civil rights movement ","title":"Directive 5120.36"},{"id":"8034806","text":"The Golden Projects are several e-government projects carried by the Government of the People's Republic of China.

Biography She was born in the Corn Clan house where her grandmother Nampeyo resided, atop Hopi First Mesa, Arizona. She was the daughter of Fannie Nampeyo and Vinton Polacca. As a child Elva would watch her grandmother make pottery and play with the clay. When she was eleven years old her mother began teaching her to make pottery. Elva became an expert at decorating and painting pottery. Her husband, Richard Tewaguna, never became involved in her pottery making. She specialized in black and red on yellow bowls and jars with traditional migration designs and eagle motifs. Her pieces most often resembled the works of her mother and grandmother. On occasion she could be persuaded to break from tradition and try some designs of her own invention. Elva took great pleasure in making pottery and could form as many as eight pots a day. During her later years when she was no longer able to finish her work, her daughter Adelle would polish, decorate and fire the pottery for her. Elva signed her pottery as \\"Elva Nampeyo\\" followed by the corn clan symbol which was initiated by her mother Fannie. Elva had five children of which four are potters including Neva, Elton, Miriam and Adelle. All sign their work with their first names followed by \\"Nampeyo\\" and an ear of corn. She died in 1985.

The Mizo, Hmars, and other Hmar sub-clan/sub-tribe trace their origin to Chhinlung / Sinlung. Most of the tribes/clans in Mizoram and its neighbouring regions have talk about Chhinlung as their most ancient origin, which is orally told by the ancient Mizo and other sub-tribe/clan. Numerous poems, songs and tales about this place have been made and handed down from generation to generation. Folklore about Sinlung describes it as a city-state where a form of democracy was in existence, and which engaged in many wars with its neighbours. There are many stories of bravery and courage, and here the tribe started the practice of headhunting. Location and origin Historians differ on the issue of the location of Sinlung and the origin of the name. Several theories and views regarding the origin and location have been put forward. Historian Hranglien Songate believed it to have been in South West China, possibly in the present Dali or Silung of Yunnan Province of today's China. Other possibilities are Xining in central China or the present Sinlung, located near the Yalong River in Sichuan Province of China. Hmars leave Sinlung The Hmars, the majority of whom now belong to a tribe of the Mizo people, eventually left Sinlung, for reasons which are not known for sure, but historians suggest either economic reasons, oppressive Chinese rulers or powerful enemies in the area. There were successive waves of migrants southward from China before 1000 AD into the Mediterranean basin, into India and into other parts of Southeast Asia. Historian Edward Thomas Williams, writes about the Qin Dynasty who, \\"violated all the rules of courteous warfare, triumphed and took over the territory and symbols of the rule of the Zhou dynasty (their predecessors)\\". It is believed that the Hmars might have been moving along with one of these waves towards the south, and eventually into India. Shan Hmar folk tales and songs describe the second settlement of the Hmars as being in Shan, which was marked by a time of prosperity and peace. According to Hranglien Songate, a Hmar historian, in Shan their civilisation advanced much farther than Sinlung. Many of the Hmar festivals such as Butukhuonglawm (Spring festival), Lungl√¢k (Autumn festival) and Sesun (Solemn celebration) have their origin in Shan.

For this musical work, Verdi utilized the national anthems of several European nations. Production In December 1943, Arturo Toscanini filmed a performance of this music for inclusion in an Office of War Information documentary about the role of Italian-Americans in aiding the Allies during World War II. Toscanini added a bridge passage to include arrangements of \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\" for the United States and \\"The Internationale\\" for the Soviet Union and the Italian partisans. Joining Toscanini in the filmed performance in NBC Studio 8-H, were tenor Jan Peerce, the Westminster Choir, and the NBC Symphony Orchestra. The film also included the overture to Verdi's opera La Forza del Destino. The narration was written by May Sarton, film editing by Boris Kaufman, and narration read by actor Burgess Meredith. The original version was released on VHS by Blackhawk Films, which retitled it Arturo Toscanini Conducts Giuseppe Verdi. A newly restored version by the Library of Congress, with the Meredith narration, has been issued on DVD. Reception The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short.

The film is part of the Academy War Film Collection, one of the largest collections of World War II era short films held outside government archives. Censorship During the post-war Red Scare, the US government crudely censored \\"The Internationale\\" out of the film. The version continued to be released without any acknowledgement of censorship.

The Wisconsin Department of Health Services oversees the program's implementation.  Origins  Before the implementation of the federally-funded State Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) initiative, Governor Tommy Thompson had wished to create a state-level family healthcare plan that used both Medicaid and SCHIP funds since his days in the state legislature. BadgerCare was passed in the wake of the Clinton administration's social service overhaul (when Aid to Families with Dependent Children was replaced by Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) and launched in July 1999. The goal was to provide coverage to families with uninsured children who were transitioning from welfare to the workforce. The program's initial enrollment was 3,400 adolescents, but the total number of individuals covered by BadgerCare increased to 51,172 by November 2000. Under the original conditions of BadgerCare, families could enroll if their net incomes were up to 185% of the federal poverty level (about $31,000 for a family of four in 2000) and could remain on BadgerCare as long as their incomes did not exceed 200% of the federal poverty level. Unlike Medicaid, a family applying for BadgerCare did not have to pass any sort of \\"asset test\\" to qualify.  Doyle administration (2003-2011)  In 2006, the Democratic-controlled Wisconsin Senate passed a bill nicknamed the \\"Healthy Wisconsin proposal\\" that would have created a near-universal health care system in Wisconsin similar to the Massachusetts health care reform of 2006 implemented by then-governor Mitt Romney. Like the Massachusetts plan and the Affordable Care Act, the Healthy Wisconsin proposal would have mandated insurance coverage for any individual not on Medicare or BadgerCare. The proposed plan would not cover dental or eye care, long-term care, nor unnecessary cosmetic surgery. The plan was to have been paid for by a $15 billion payroll tax, making it incredibly unpopular among the Republican- controlled Wisconsin Assembly, and Democratic governor Jim Doyle. = Transition to BadgerCare+ = Since Governor Doyle opposed the Senate's mandate plan, he chose instead to expand BadgerCare, claiming that 98% of Wisconsinites would have some form of health insurance under his expansion. Doyle called the revised program BadgerCare+ and included it in his 2007-2009 biennial budget. BadgerCare+ began functioning on February 1, 2008. According to a state document sent to healthcare providers in January 2008, BadgerCare+ expanded enrollment to: * All uninsured children * More pregnant women * More parents and caretaker relatives * Parents with children in foster care who are working to reunify their families * Young adults exiting out-of-home care, such as foster care, because they have turned 18 * Certain farmers and other self-employed parents and caretaker relatives The revised plan also covered tobacco cessation products such as nicotine gum. = Enrollment issues and BadgerCare+ Basic = The extremely high number of applications for the BadgerCare+ Core plan put undue stress on the program's budget, and Doyle suspended enrollments for that program in October 2009 with 21,000 individuals still on the waiting list. To assuage the thousands of Wisconsinites still seeking coverage, Doyle proposed an additional plan named BadgerCare+ Basic, targeted at childless adults. The income stipulations for BadgerCare+ Basic were $21,660 a year for a single childless individual and $29,140 for a childless couple.

They descended from several generations of potters and continue the polychrome style of painting made famous by their parents Lela and Van Gutierrez. At age twelve, Margaret began apprenticing as a potter with her mother. Luther's father taught him where to find, and how to process the clay. Margaret and Luther began making pottery together in the 1960s. Margaret and Luther‚Äôs painted slips included unique color combinations. Their first creations included polychrome bowls, jars and wedding vases with designs centered on the Avanyu (water serpent), rain, clouds and lightning and sky bands. In the 1970s they came up with their original idea of making polychrome caricatures of animals and other smaller figurines rather than the jars made famous by their parents. These were painted with the same slips and pigments used on earlier pieces. Margaret and Luther participated in the Seven Families in Pueblo Pottery exhibition at the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology, University of New Mexico in 1974, and the Popovi Da Studio of Indian Arts, gallery show in Santa Fe in 1976. After Luther died Margaret continued to make pottery with the assistance of Luther‚Äôs daughter Pauline but Pauline died shortly thereafter. Margaret now works with her great-niece Stephanie Naranjo. Today, the manufacture of famous multicolored polychrome is waning. Luther‚Äôs son Paul, his wife Dorothy, and their son Gary, make blackware mudhead figures and animalitos (small animals) in large quantities.

The Claregalway Friary is a medieval Franciscan abbey located in the town of Claregalway, County Galway, Ireland. The abbey site features an east-facing, cruciform church (minus a south transept) with a 24-metre (80 ft) bell tower. The ruins of the living quarters and cloister are situated to the south of the church building.  History  A 19th-century view showing the abbey, the old bridge and the tower The monastery was commissioned in about 1252 by John de Cogan, a Norman knight who took possession of the area following the Norman conquest of Connacht. The Franciscan community at the abbey lived under the patronage of the de Cogan clan until 1327, when John Magnus de Cogan gave them the building and surrounding lands. In return for this favour, the monks were asked to present a rose to de Cogan and his descendants on the annual feast day of St. John the Baptist (24 June). The community flourished until the mid-16th century, when the English Reformation disrupted the Catholic establishment in Ireland. From that time on, the monks of Claregalway struggled to keep the abbey viable against political and economic forces. The cloister within the abbey ruins On 11 July 1538, forces under the command of Lord Leonard Gray ransacked and looted the abbey while on march to Galway. In 1570, Queen Elizabeth I granted possession of the monastery to Sir Richard de Burgo. In 1589, the monastery buildings were turned into a barracks under the administration of the English provincial governor, Sir Richard Bingham. During the reign of King James, the property was given to the Earl of Clanrickarde. By 1641, the Franciscans had reoccupied the abbey, but the building was in poor repair and the community lacked the ability to renovate it. In 1731, Edward Synge, Anglican archbishop of Tuam recorded that \\"there is a friary in Claregalway, where three at least are always resident.\\" The High Sheriff of the county, Stratford Eyre, reported in 1732 that the monks \\"lived close\\" to the abbey. The bell tower Church records indicate that the community numbered about 220 religious in 1766, but this number had declined to about 150 by 1782. French diplomat Coquebert de Montbret wrote in 1791 that \\"the monks are settling down among the ruins.\\" The remains of the friary's living quarters The size of the community continued to dwindle. By 1838, it was down to only two members. Archives of the Galway Vindicator, a local newspaper, indicate that the community's last two monks departed for a larger community in Galway in November 1847. For some years after the monastery closed, members of the Galway friary continued to travel to the site on feast days to celebrate Mass and hear confession, but these activities had ceased by 1860. In 1892, a Lord Clanmorris donated the property to the Commissioner of Public Works under the provisions of the Ancient Monuments Act of 1882. Today, the abbey buildings and grounds are open to the public free of charge. The burial grounds surrounding the building are maintained and still in use.

It officially started on May 15, 1969, in the eastern Pacific and lasted until November 30, 1969. However, the first named storm, Ava, did not form until July 1, the latest date that the first named storm of a season formed. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. This season was below average in activity with ten named storms forming, of which only four reached hurricane strength, making it the third least active season, tied with the 1995 and 1979. There were no major hurricanes this year. Most of the storms that formed this season never approached land. Notable storms include Tropical Storm Emily and Hurricane Jennifer. The precursor disturbance of Tropical Storm Emily killed nine people in Mexico and left 100,000 homeless. Hurricane Jennifer was the only landfalling named storm of the season, causing one death. In this season, only three storms (Ava, Bernice, and Florence) were operationally categorized as tropical depressions at the first advisory. All other storms were operationally upgraded directly to storm strength, bypassing the depression stage. __TOC__ Systems ImageSize = width:800 height:200 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/05/1969 till:01/11/1969 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/05/1969 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_<39_mph_(0‚Äì62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39‚Äì73_mph_(63‚Äì117 km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74‚Äì95_mph_(119‚Äì153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96‚Äì110_mph_(154‚Äì177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111‚Äì130_mph_(178‚Äì209-km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_131‚Äì155_mph_(210‚Äì249_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_>=156_mph_(>=250_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:11 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:30/05/1969 till:31/05/1969 color:TD text:\\"One\\" from:04/06/1969 till:08/06/1969 color:TD text:\\"Two\\" from:01/07/1969 till:08/07/1969 color:TS text:\\"Ava\\" from:09/07/1969 till:17/07/1969 color:C1 text:\\"Bernice\\" from:22/07/1969 till:23/07/1969 color:TS text:\\"Claudia\\" from:04/08/1969 till:09/08/1969 color:C1 text:\\"Doreen\\" barset:break from:05/08/1969 till:05/08/1969 color:TD text:\\"Seven\\" from:22/08/1969 till:23/08/1969 color:TS text:\\"Emily\\" from:02/09/1969 till:07/09/1969 color:TS text:\\"Florence\\" from:08/09/1969 till:12/09/1969 color:C1 text:\\"Glenda\\" from:19/09/1969 till:25/09/1969 color:TS text:\\"Heather\\" from:30/09/1969 till:03/10/1969 color:TS text:\\"Irah\\" from:03/10/1969 till:04/10/1969 color:TD text:\\"Thirteen\\" barset:break from:04/10/1969 till:05/10/1969 color:TD text:\\"Fourteen\\" from:09/10/1969 till:12/10/1969 color:C1 text:\\"Jennifer (C1)\\" bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/05/1969 till:01/06/1969 text:May from:01/06/1969 till:01/07/1969 text:June from:01/07/1969 till:01/08/1969 text:July from:01/08/1969 till:01/09/1969 text:August from:01/09/1969 till:01/10/1969 text:September from:01/10/1969 till:01/11/1969 text:October TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(617,30) text:\\"Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale)\\" =Tropical Depression One= The first depression of the season formed off the coast of Mexico on May 30 and moved westward. The depression dissipated the next day. =Tropical Depression Two= Tropical Depression Two formed on June 4 and lasted until June 5, when the storm was considered dissipated. The depression would regenerate on June 7, but, like its previous time active, only lasted until the day later, only this time, the depression never regenerated. =Tropical Storm Ava= On June 30, an area of convection formed off the coast of Guatemala. The system showed no signs of development when June ended, but on July 1 the storm began gaining organization and, after a circulation had developed, was deemed a tropical depression. The depression further intensified, becoming a tropical storm on July 2. Ava tracked west-northwestward at a pace of 17 mph (27 km/h) while going through steady intensification. Ava then began to decelerate in forward motion, and after the storm had turned to a more northward path, reached its peak intensity of 50 mph (80 km/h) on July 5. On July 7, Ava was downgraded to a depression while near Socorro Island and the last advisory was issued on the weakened Ava later that day. The remains of Ava continued northwest and then took a westward move on July 10. By this point, Ava had completely dissipated. Despite its proximity to land, no reports of damages or deaths were reported in connection to Ava. When Ava formed on July 1, it became the latest that a tropical storm had formed in the East Pacific basin. =Hurricane Bernice= The system that became Hurricane Bernice was an area of disturbed weather. After signs of a circulation appeared on July 8, the system was designated a tropical depression. The depression developed and strengthened into Tropical Storm Bernice on July 10. Bernice continued a west-northwestard motion and, on July 12, achieved Category 1 strength. Bernice then accelerated in forward speed from 9 mph to 13 mph (20 km/h). Afterwards, Bernice began to weaken, with it being downgraded into a storm on July 15. Further weakening commenced, and Bernice was downgraded to a depression on July 16. The final advisory on Bernice was issued on July 17.ikw2105.tmp Bernice never affected land. Bernice can be seen in photographs taken by Apollo 11 on the 16th,http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/apollo/frame/?AS11-36-5337 and could also be seen in a TV broadcast made by the astronauts. =Tropical Storm Claudia= On July 21, a tropical depression advisory was issued on a loosely organized area of convection based on satellite pictures because of a lack of ships reporting in the area where it formed.http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/098/mwr-098-04-0280.pdf The initial forecast was for an increase in strength and motion into the easterlies at a pace of 11 mph (17 km/h). On July 22, it was decided that the system had achieved enough organization to become a tropical storm and was named Claudia. Claudia's time as a tropical storm was brief; it was downgraded into a depression on July 23, only 24 hours after first becoming a storm. The storm continued to weaken, dissipating later that day. Because of a lack of shipping near where Claudia existed, intensity forecasts were based almost entirely on satellite presentation. The only ship near the storm was a Navy vessel named Fernie. The ship reported an eastward wind of 25 mph (40 km/h) about 50 miles from the center and a pressure of 1006 mb. =Hurricane Doreen= Like Claudia before it, Doreen's formation (which started as a large cloud mass on the ITCZ) went mostly unmonitored by ship because of a lack of shipping. On August 4, a relatively unusual cirrus cloud formation resembling a pinwheel formed over the center of the storm. The formation had provided efficient evidence that the system had developed into a tropical storm, bypassing the depression stage. Doreen continued a northwest track, deepening along the way, and on August 5, a ship reported 70 mph (110 km/h) winds with a 993 mb pressure near the storm center. Based on this, Doreen was upgraded to a hurricane, the second of the season. From here, Doreen began to take a more west-northwest path, passing by Socorro Island on August 6. On August 7, Doreen's eye broke up and, as a result, Doreen quickly weakened, being downgraded into a tropical storm shortly afterward. Continued weakening brought Doreen down to a depression on August 8, when Doreen slowed to a crawl. Doreen held on to depression strength until August 9, when it entered an area of easterlies, which did nothing to help the already-weakening Doreen, but rather dissipating it quickly. Traces of Doreen continued to show up on satellite until August 11, when no traces remained. =Tropical Depression Seven= A very short lived storm, Tropical Depression Seven formed off the coast of Mexico on August 5, dissipating the same day. = Tropical Storm Emily = Emily's origins can be traced back to a large low-pressure center over Mexico that persisted from August 20 to August 21. During that time, thunderstorm activity flared up over the Mexican mainland, but no evidence of a circulation was found. However, on August 21, a circulation developed at around 14¬∞ N and was apparent on weather maps, but at the time, no major winds were suspected near the center. Finally, on August 22, a ship in the area reported 45-50 mph (72‚Äì80 km/h) winds, and based on this report, the system was initiated as Tropical Storm Emily, becoming the third storm in a row to have been upgraded straight to tropical storm strength, bypassing depression stage. From this point on, early reports on Emily were plagued by delays, namely the initial formation report, which was delayed long enough to miss the first advisory. A 998 mb pressure was recorded in Emily on August 23 and Emily reached its peak intensity of 65 mph (104 km/h) later that day, with a circular eye being reported by recon. Suddenly, Emily started rapidly weakening, becoming poorly defined later that day, and by August 24, no traces of Emily remained. While no casualties or damages were reported in connection to Emily, the low- pressure center that formed Emily was responsible for nine deaths on the mainland and rendered 100,000 homeless due to flooding. =Tropical Storm Florence= A low-pressure area that persisted off the coast of Mexico produced squalls during late August and early September. On September 2, the system developed and became a tropical depression. The depression was deemed a storm after satellite imagery showed a cloud pattern typical of a tropical storm and the depression was upgraded after the fact. Florence continued northward, strengthening to near-hurricane intensity with peak winds of 70 mph (112 km/h) and a pressure of 992 mb. On September 7, Florence moved into colder water, which took a fast and heavy toll on Florence, weakening it to a depression shortly afterward and, not long after the downgrade, Florence had dissipated. =Hurricane Glenda= The remains of what was formerly Hurricane Francelia crossed over Central America and contributed to an area of convection that formed 120 miles southwest of Acapulco. A separate mass of clouds existed west-northwest of the main disturbance but, unlike the former, this mass did not organize. The storm began to organize and, like nearly all other storms of this season, Glenda was named on September 7, bypassing the depression phase when a report from a ship indicated a barometric pressure of 997 mb and was falling rapidly as well as reporting heavy showers. Glenda continued its motion northwest while increasing in strength, with a closed eye being noticed on September 9. Because of the closed eye and cirrus cap, it was determined that Glenda had become a hurricane. Glenda's time as a hurricane was very short lived as it was downgraded to a storm just six hours after the initial upgrade.http://www.weather.unisys.com/hurricane/e_pacific/1969/GLENDA/track.gif The weakening trend continued while it moved northwest, towards the Baja California Peninsula, but Glenda moved westward, avoiding landfall. It dissipated on September 12. =Tropical Storm Heather= The information is unclear on how Heather developed but she was first noticed on September 18 1,000 miles southwest of La Paz, Baja California. Like Claudia and Doreen, Heather's lifespan was mostly monitored by satellite and Air Force recon because of a lack of shipping in the general area. From where it first grew, Heather moved west-northwest, reached its peak intensity of 65 mph (104 km/h) winds, and then eventually weakened to a depression on September 22 and was considered dissipated. On September 23, however, Heather regenerated. Heather would begin to accelerate, followed by a westward motion on September 25, dissipating later that day, this time for good. Heather's peak intensity was kept at 65 mph both operationally and in post-season because of cool inflow. However, Heather's satellite presentation more resembled a hurricane, showing broad spiral arms. =Tropical Storm Irah= Radio interference and low angle plagued research into a possible circulation that had developed in an area of the ITCZ during September 28 and September 29. Finally, on September 30, a depression was thought to have developed. However, a bulletin from a different source provided with a mosaic image was the evidence used in giving the system the name Irah and treating it as a tropical storm. Irah moved west-northwest until October 1, when it curved northward. By this point, Irah had started weakening, dropping into a depression on October 3. Shortly afterward, Irah had degenerated into an area of squalls. =Tropical Depression Thirteen= Tropical Depression Thirteen formed off the coast of Mexico on October 3. Moving north-northwest, the depression made landfall late on October 4, dissipating soon thereafter. No deaths or damages were reported in connection to the depression. =Tropical Depression Fourteen= Tropical Depression Fourteen formed on October 4 and dissipated the day after. =Hurricane Jennifer= The final storm of the season, Jennifer, had a similar origin to Irah when it originated from an area of disturbed weather on the ITCZ. The system proceeded to develop and became a tropical disturbance, but no reports showed that the system was a tropical cyclone, although they reported 30 mph (48 km/h) winds and showers. On October 8, a German ship in the area relayed a message to the bureau mentioning an area with a 995 mb pressure (the ship had previously recorded 1003 mb before it sharply fell to the 995 reported). Later, another ship reported 45 mph (72 km/h) winds in the vicinity, prompting the advisories that Tropical Storm Jennifer had formed. Jennifer moved to the northwest, obtaining hurricane strength on October 9. At this time, Jennifer was 200 miles off shore, moving northwest at 7 mph (11 km/h), paralleling the coast. Then Jennifer turned to the northeast while accelerating, ending up about 60 miles west of Mazatl√°n. Around this time, a dropsonde malfunction ceased any penetration into the storm, but the plane estimated the winds of the storm to be 55 mph (88 km/h) winds. On late October 11, Jennifer moved onshore and dissipated on October 12. Jennifer was reported to have killed one person and injured 15, all in Mazatl√°n. Jennifer also caused a ferry and twelves boats used for fishing shrimp to be washed up in the Mazatl√°n Harbor. Over 30 other shrimp boats were reported missing, but were moored in unknown areas. Damage was reportedly extensive, but no monetary figures exist. Storm names The following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1969. No names were retired, so it was used again in the 1973 season. This is the same list as list 2 used during 1960-1965, except for Heather, which replaced Hazel. A storm was named Heather for the first time in 1969.

Different software tools have been developed to assist designers in finding optimized products or processes/services. DfE is also the original name of a United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) program, created in 1992, that works to prevent pollution, and the risk pollution presents to humans and the environment. The program provides information regarding safer chemical formulations for cleaning and other products. EPA renamed its program \\"Safer Choice\\" in 2015.  Introduction  Each piece of the pie chart depicts the role that the individual processes play in the overall design and production of a product. In recent years the environment has begun to play an important role in this diagram. If any piece is missing, production may not be able to occur. This figure was adopted from Conrad Luttropp and Jessica Lagerstedt. Initial guidelines for a DfE approach were written in 1990 by East Meets West, a New York-based non-governmental organization. It became a global movement targeting design initiatives and incorporating environmental motives to improve product design in order to minimize health and environmental impacts by incorporating it from design stage all the way to the manufacturing process. The DfE strategy aims to improve technology and design tactics to expand the scope of products. By incorporating eco-efficiency into design tactics, DfE takes into consideration the entire life-cycle of the product, while still making products usable but minimizing resource use. The key focus of DfE is to minimize the environmental-economic cost to consumers while still focusing on the life-cycle framework of the product. By balancing both customer needs as well as environmental and social impacts DfE aims to \\"improve the product use experience both for consumers and producers, while minimally impacting the environment\\". Design for Environment practices accessdate=April 10, 2013--> Four main concepts that fall under the DfE umbrella. * Design for environmental processing and manufacturing: Raw material extraction (mining, drilling, etc.), processing (processing reusable materials, metal melting, etc.) and manufacturing are done using materials and processes which are not dangerous to the environment or the employees working on said processes. This includes the minimization of waste and hazardous by- products, air pollution, energy expenditure and other factors. * Design for environmental packaging: Materials used in packaging are environmentally responsible, which can be achieved through the reuse of shipping products, elimination of unnecessary paper and packaging products, efficient use of materials and space, use of recycled and/or recyclable materials. * Design for disposal or reuse: The end-of-life of a product is very important, because some products emit dangerous chemicals into the air, ground and water after they are disposed of in a landfill. Planning for the reuse or refurbishing of a product will change the types of materials that would be used, how they could later be disassembled and reused, and the environmental impacts such materials have. * Design for energy efficiency: The design of products to reduce overall energy consumption throughout the product's life. Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is employed to forecast the impacts of different (production) alternatives of the product in question, thus being able to choose the most environmentally friendly. A life cycle analysis can serve as a tool when determining the environmental impact of a product or process. Proper LCAs can help a designer compare several different products according to several categories, such as energy use, toxicity, acidification, CO2 emissions, ozone depletion, resource depletion and many others. By comparing different products, designers can make decisions about which environmental hazard to focus on in order to make the product more environmentally friendly. Why do firms want to design for the environment? Modern day businesses all aim to produce goods at a low cost while maintaining quality, staying competitive in the global marketplace, and meeting consumer preferences for more environment friendly products. To help businesses meet these challenges, EPA encourages businesses to incorporate environmental considerations into the design process. The benefits of incorporating DfE include: cost savings, reduced business and environmental risks, expanded business and market opportunities, and to meet environmental regulations. Companies and products Designfortheenvironment Fig3 *Starbucks: Starbucks is decreasing its carbon footprint by building more energy efficient stores and facilities, conserving energy and water, and purchasing renewable energy credits. Starbucks has achieved LEED certificates in 116 stores in 12 countries. Starbucks has even created a portable, LEED certified store in Denver. It is Starbucks' goal to reduce energy consumption by 25% and to cover 100% of its electricity with renewable energy by 2015. *Hewlett Packard: HP is working towards reducing energy used in manufacturing, developing materials that have less environmental impact, and designing easily recyclable equipment. *IBM: Their goal is to extend product life beyond just production, and to use reusable and recyclable products. This means that IBM is currently working on creating products that can be safely disposed of at the end of its product life. They are also reducing consumption of energy to minimize their carbon footprint. *Philips: For almost 20 years now, sustainable development has been a crucial part of Philips decision making and manufacturing process. Philips' goal is to produce products with their environmental responsibility in mind. Not only are they working on reducing energy during the manufacturing process, Phillips is also participating in a unique project, philanthropy through design. Since 2005, Philips has been working on and developing philanthropy through design. They collaborate with other organizations to use their expertise and innovation to help the more fragile parts of our society. Besides these large brand names there are several other consumer product companies in the DfE program this including: *Atlantic Chemical & Equipment Co. *American Cleaning Solutions *BCD Supply *Beta Technology *Brighton USA How does a business design for the environment? A business can design for the environment by: * Evaluating the human health and environmental impacts of its processes and products. * Identifying what information is needed to make human health and environment decisions * Conducting an assessment of alternatives * Considering cross-media impacts and the benefits of substituting chemicals * Reducing the use and release of toxic chemicals through the innovation of cleaner technologies that use safer chemicals. * Implementing pollution prevention, energy efficiency, and other resource conservation measures. * Making products that can be reused and recycled * Monitoring the environmental impacts and costs associated with each product or process * Recognizing that although change can be rapid, in many cases a cycle of evaluation and continuous improvement is needed. Safer Choice labeling program EPA's DfE labeling program was renamed \\"Safer Choice\\" in 2015. Current U.S. laws and regulations encouraging DfE in the electronics industry =National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)= EPA promulgated the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to establish basic air pollution control requirements across the U.S. The NAAQS sets standards on six main sources of pollutants, which include emissions of: ozone (0.12 ppm per 1 hour), carbon monoxide (35 ppm per 1 hour; primary standard), particulate matter (50g/m^3 at an annual arithmetic mean), sulfur dioxide (80g/m^3 at an annual arithmetic mean), nitrogen dioxide (100g/m^3 at an annual arithmetic mean), and lead emissions (1.5g/m^3 at an annual arithmetic mean). =Stratospheric ozone protection= Stratospheric ozone protection is required by section 602 of the Clean Air Act of 1990. This regulation aims to decrease emission of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other chemicals that are destroying the stratospheric ozone layer. The protection initiative categorizes ozone- depleting substances into two classes: Class I, and Class II. Class I substances include 20 different kinds of chemicals and have all been phased- out of production processes since 2000. Class II substances consist of 33 different hydro-chlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). The EPA has already begun plans to decrease emissions in HCFCs and plan to completely phase out the class II substances by 2030. =Reporting requirements for releases of toxic substances= A firm operating in the electronics industry in Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Codes 20-39 that has more than 10 full-time employees and consumes more than 10,000 lbs per year of any toxic chemical lists in 40 CFR 372.65 must file a toxic release inventory. =Other regulations= * National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) * National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES‚ÄìWater pollution permit program) * Underground Injection Control Program * Hazardous waste management * Underground storage tank management See also * Biodiversity * Conservation movement * Design impact measures * Ecodesign * Environmental design * Environmental movement * Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design * Life-cycle assessment * Natural environment * Sustainable design * Sustainability References External links * The European Union: The European Platform on Life Cycle Assessment * Sustainable design for the environment * Department Life Cycle Engineering, University of Stuttgart (English) * Sustainable Building Alliance.org * Sustainable Residential Design.org: Using Low-Impact Materials Resource Guide Category:Sustainable design Category:Design for X Category:Industrial ecology Category:United States Environmental Protection Agency ","title":"Design for the Environment"},{"id":"8035060","text":"A structural diagram of the open ocean plankton ecosystem model of Fasham, Ducklow & McKelvie (1990). An ecosystem model is an abstract, usually mathematical, representation of an ecological system (ranging in scale from an individual population, to an ecological community, or even an entire biome), which is studied to better understand the real system. Using data gathered from the field, ecological relationships‚Äîsuch as the relation of sunlight and water availability to photosynthetic rate, or that between predator and prey populations‚Äîare derived, and these are combined to form ecosystem models. These model systems are then studied in order to make predictions about the dynamics of the real system. Often, the study of inaccuracies in the model (when compared to empirical observations) will lead to the generation of hypotheses about possible ecological relations that are not yet known or well understood. Models enable researchers to simulate large-scale experiments that would be too costly or unethical to perform on a real ecosystem. They also enable the simulation of ecological processes over very long periods of time (i.e. simulating a process that takes centuries in reality, can be done in a matter of minutes in a computer model).Hall & Day, 1990: pp. 13-14 Ecosystem models have applications in a wide variety of disciplines, such as natural resource management, ecotoxicology and environmental health, agriculture, and wildlife conservation. Ecological modelling has even been applied to archaeology with varying degrees of success, for example, combining with archaeological models to explain the diversity and mobility of stone tools. Types of models There are two major types of ecological models, which are generally applied to different types of problems: (1) analytic models and (2) simulation / computational models. Analytic models are typically relatively simple (often linear) systems, that can be accurately described by a set of mathematical equations whose behavior is well-known. Simulation models on the other hand, use numerical techniques to solve problems for which analytic solutions are impractical or impossible. Simulation models tend to be more widely used, and are generally considered more ecologically realistic, while analytic models are valued for their mathematical elegance and explanatory power.Hall & Day, 1990 p. 9 Ecopath is a powerful software system which uses simulation and computational methods to model marine ecosystems. It is widely used by marine and fisheries scientists as a tool for modelling and visualising the complex relationships that exist in real world marine ecosystems.Christensen V (2009) \\"The future of Ecopath\\" In: Palomares, MLD, Morissette L, Cisneros-Montemayor A, Varkey D, Coll M, Piroddi C (Eds), Ecopath 25 Years Conference Proceedings: Extended Abstracts, Fisheries Centre Research Reports 17(3): 159‚Äì160. University of British Columbia. Model design Diagram of the Silver Springs model (Odum, 1971). Note the aggregation into functional groups such as \\"herbivores\\" or \\"decomposers\\".Odum, H.T. (1971). Environment, Power, and Society. Wiley-Interscience New York, N.Y. The process of model design begins with a specification of the problem to be solved, and the objectives for the model. Ecological systems are composed of an enormous number of biotic and abiotic factors that interact with each other in ways that are often unpredictable, or so complex as to be impossible to incorporate into a computable model. Because of this complexity, ecosystem models typically simplify the systems they are studying to a limited number of components that are well understood, and deemed relevant to the problem that the model is intended to solve. The process of simplification typically reduces an ecosystem to a small number of state variables and mathematical functions that describe the nature of the relationships between them.Hall & Day, 1990: p. 21 The number of ecosystem components that are incorporated into the model is limited by aggregating similar processes and entities into functional groups that are treated as a unit.Hall & Day, 1990: p. 19 After establishing the components to be modeled and the relationships between them, another important factor in ecosystem model structure is the representation of space used. Historically, models have often ignored the confounding issue of space. However, for many ecological problems spatial dynamics are an important part of the problem, with different spatial environments leading to very different outcomes. Spatially explicit models (also called \\"spatially distributed\\" or \\"landscape\\" models) attempt to incorporate a heterogeneous spatial environment into the model. A spatial model is one that has one or more state variables that are a function of space, or can be related to other spatial variables. Validation After construction, models are validated to ensure that the results are acceptably accurate or realistic. One method is to test the model with multiple sets of data that are independent of the actual system being studied. This is important since certain inputs can cause a faulty model to output correct results. Another method of validation is to compare the model's output with data collected from field observations. Researchers frequently specify beforehand how much of a disparity they are willing to accept between parameters output by a model and those computed from field data. Examples =The Lotka‚ÄìVolterra equations= time-series of the Lotka-Volterra model. Note that the two populations exhibit cyclic behaviour, and that the predator cycle lags behind that of the prey. One of the earliest,Earlier work on smallpox by Daniel Bernoulli and human overpopulation by Thomas Malthus predates that of Lotka and Volterra, but is not strictly ecological in nature and most well-known, ecological models is the predator- prey model of Alfred J. Lotka (1925) and Vito Volterra (1926). This model takes the form of a pair of ordinary differential equations, one representing a prey species, the other its predator. : \\\\frac{dX}{dt} = \\\\alpha . X - \\\\beta . X . Y : \\\\frac{dY}{dt} = \\\\gamma . \\\\beta . X . Y - \\\\delta . Y where, { style=\\"background-color: transparent; width: 90%\\"  width=\\"50%\\" align=\\"left\\" valign=\\"top\\"  * X is the number/concentration of the prey species; * Y is the number/concentration of the predator species; * \\\\alpha is the prey species' growth rate;  width=\\"50%\\" align=\\"left\\" valign=\\"top\\"  * \\\\beta is the predation rate of Y upon X; * \\\\gamma is the assimilation efficiency of Y; * \\\\delta is the mortality rate of the predator species } Volterra originally devised the model to explain fluctuations in fish and shark populations observed in the Adriatic Sea after the First World War (when fishing was curtailed). However, the equations have subsequently been applied more generally. Although simple, they illustrate some of the salient features of ecological models: modelled biological populations experience growth, interact with other populations (as either predators, prey or competitors) and suffer mortality. A credible, simple alternative to the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model and its common prey dependent generalizations is the ratio dependent or Arditi-Ginzburg model. The two are the extremes of the spectrum of predator interference models. According to the authors of the alternative view, the data show that true interactions in nature are so far from the Lotka-Volterra extreme on the interference spectrum that the model can simply be discounted as wrong. They are much closer to the ratio dependent extreme, so if a simple model is needed one can use the Arditi-Ginzburg model as the first approximation.Arditi, R. and Ginzburg, L.R. (2012) How Species Interact: Altering the Standard View on Trophic Ecology Oxford University Press. . =Others= The theoretical ecologist Robert Ulanowicz has used information theory tools to describe the structure of ecosystems, emphasizing mutual information (correlations) in studied systems. Drawing on this methodology and prior observations of complex ecosystems, Ulanowicz depicts approaches to determining the stress levels on ecosystems and predicting system reactions to defined types of alteration in their settings (such as increased or reduced energy flow, and eutrophication. Conway's Game of Life and its variations model ecosystems where proximity of the members of a population are factors in population growth.

He was one of the roshei yeshiva at Yeshiva Torah Vodaas, and rabbi of the summer camp network run by Agudath Israel of America. Belsky served for more than 28 years as a senior kashrut advisor to the OU.  Education  Belsky received his semicha from Yeshiva Torah Vodaas, in Brooklyn, NY, in 1962, and from Rabbi Moshe Feinstein in 1965. He also studied at Beth Medrash Elyon beginning at age 17. His Rosh Yeshiva was Rav Yaakov Kamenetsky.  Career  Belsky served as a member of the Iggud HaRabbonimIgud HaRabonim (Rabbinical Alliance of America) Beth din under, successively, Rabbis Yitzchok Isaac Liebes, Baruch Leizerowski and Herschel Kurzrock. Some events that he addressed with this beth din were: the aftermath of the 9/11 World Trade Center attack and freeing its widows from agunah status, New York City tap water, human-hair wigs from India, surrogate motherhood, and a kashrus scandal in Monsey. His first kashrus position was with the Kof-K. He served with the Orthodox Union starting in 1987, and was eventually described as one of \\"the chief experts for the Orthodox Union, which certifies more than 600,000 products as kosher.\\"McNeil Jr., Donald J. (December 1, 2004) \\"Videos Cited in Calling Kosher Slaughterhouse Inhumane\\", The New York Times In 2004, Belsky ruled that water that might contain microscopic nonkosher organisms is kosher even if it is unfiltered.Berger, Joseph (November 7, 2004) \\"The Water's Fine, But is it Kosher?\\", The New York Times The same year he ruled that \\"gruesome\\" slaughtering of animals at Agriprocessors, then the largest glatt kosher meat producer in the United States, appeared not to violate kosher laws as long as the animal \\"felt nothing\\". He later ruled on a kashrus scandal surrounding Doheny Meats, which had been videoed violating the laws of kashrus, saying that food that had been sold by Doheny prior to the scandal could still be considered kosher. In September 2005, Belsky served as the keynote speaker at the Igud Horabbonim Annual Siyum HaShas. The event also served as the chag ha‚Äôsemichah where 35 students of his received their certificates of semichah.  Controversies  Belsky publicly defended confessed sexual abuser Yosef Kolko, who taught children at a Lakewood, New Jersey, yeshiva. Further, he condemned the victim and his parents for reporting the sexual abuse to the police, and wrote that one who does so \\"has no share in the world to come.\\" Belsky was criticized for his actions in this regard. According to The Jewish Week, the Ocean County, New Jersey District Attorney privately warned Belsky to cease and desist writing letters defending Kolko, or risk prosecution. According to court documents, Belsky was alleged to have served on a Beth din together with Mendel Epstein and Martin Wolmark which approved the use of physical violence against Jews who were civilly divorced, yet refused to give a get (Jewish divorce document) to their wives. In 2000, Belsky sided against rabbis in Borough Park, Brooklyn who established a controversial eruv, referring to them as amateurs and populists.Barnes, Julian E. (June 2, 2000) \\"Symbolic Line Divides Jews in Borough Park; A Debate Over Strictures for Sabbath Observance\\", The New York Times In a 2011 interview with The New York Times about a divorce case, Belsky described a court-ordered child custody order as \\"a joke\\" since it interfered with observance of the Jewish Sabbath.Oppenheimer, Mark (January 3, 2011) \\"Religious Divorce Dispute Leads to Secular Protest\\", The New York Times  Personal  Belsky was the son of Rabbi Berel and Chana Tzirel Belsky. His maternal grandfather is Binyomin Wilhelm, a founder of Yeshiva Torah Vodaas. In 2012, he suffered a serious medical emergency. At that time, the name Chaim was added to Rav Belsky's name.

O. umbellatum is a relatively short plant, occurring in tufts of basal linear leaves, producing conspicuous white flowers, in a stellate pattern, in mid to late spring. The flowers open late in the day (hence some of its common names), but when closed have a green stripe on the outside. It is native throughout most of southern and central Europe, and north-western Africa. O. umbellatum is often grown as a garden ornamental, but in North America and other areas it has escaped cultivation and can be found in many areas, where it may become an invasive noxious weed. Parts of the plant are considered poisonous, but are used in some regional cuisines. Essences are also sold as patent remedies. O. umbellatum has been depicted in art by artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, and folklore has suggested it originally grew from fragments of the star of Bethlehem, hence its horticultural name. Description O. umbellatum is a perennial herbaceous bulbous plant (geophyte), dying back after flowering, to an underground storage bulb. The following year, it regrows from the often shallow rooted bulbs, which are ovoid with a membranous coat, long and in diameter. The bulbs form multiple leaf-bearing bulbils that soon separate but remain close by. Initially the plant forms 6‚Äì10 basal leaves, that arise in tufts from the bulbs. The leaves are grooved (canaliculate), smooth (glabrous) and linear with a white to light green linear midrib on the upper surface, and grow up to long and broad. O. umbellatum is scapose, with a glabrous flower stem (scape) that emerges from the leaf tufts later and is about in height, tapering at its tip. The inflorescence bears 6‚Äì20 flat star shaped flowers on ascending stems (pedicels) () associated with membranaceous leaflets (bracts) () in an open branching umbrella (umbel) shaped terminal cluster, described as a corymbose raceme. The petal-like perianth is radially symmetric (actinomorphic), which is in diameter, consists of six lanceolate tepals which are white with a green stripe on the underside (outside), in length and wide. From the outside the closed flower appears green with white margins. The reproductive parts consist of both male (androecium) and female (gynoecium) parts (hermaphrodite). The androecium has six yellow-brown stamens that are free of the perianth and form two groups, each of about , with filaments that are simple and flattened and oblong anthers that are . The gynoecium has a single pistil with a superior (i. e. above the floral parts) ovary that is ovoid to obovoid, , and longer than the style that extends above it. The fruit is a capsule which is oblong-ovoid with 3 sides and 6 ribs. Within it, each locule contains many seeds with a black coat of phytomelan (see Floral diagram). The species is polyploid (having more than two sets of chromosomes). Taxonomy Ornithogalum umbellatum has been known and described for a long time, according to some authors, as far back as Dioscorides in the first century. In 16th-century England, William Turner (1562) mentions it. In Henry Lyte's 1586 New Herbal (a translation into English of Dodoens' 1554 Cruydeboeck), reference is made to an Ornithogalum as the White Field Onion. John Gerard, in his Herball of 1597, describes Ornithogalum as the \\"star of Bethlem\\". The species known today as Ornithogalum umbellatum was first formally described by Linnaeus (1753), who is the botanical authority for the species (L.). O. umbellatum is the type species of the genus Ornithogalum, which contains about 50 species. The lectotype (reference specimen) was established by Stearn in 1983. =Etymology= The species epithet reflects the flower formation as an umbel. The plant's many common names include garden star-of-Bethlehem, sleepydick, nap-at-noon, grass lily, summer snowflake, snowdrop, starflower, bird's milk, chinkerichee, ten-o'clock lady, eleven-o'clock lady, Bath asparagus, and star of Hungary. The references to the time of day reflect the opening times of the flowers, opening late and closing at night or in cloudy conditions. The star names indicate the arrangement of the petals and bird's milk is a literal translation of ornithogalum. It has also been called dove's dung, equating it with a plant described in the bible. The name star-of-Bethlehem is shared by a number of species of Ornithogalum, due to the white stellate flowers, and the folklore relating the flower to the biblical star-of-Bethlehem (see In popular culture). Distribution and habitat A native of most of Europe, North Africa and western Asia, Ornithogalum umbellatum has been adopted as an ornamental garden plant from where it has escaped and naturalised widely in North America, where it is considered an aggressive noxious weed of lawns, gardens and no-till agricultural land, which can be difficult to eradicate. In Europe its range extends from Ireland and Portugal in the west, Italy in the south, north to parts of France and east to Turkey and the Levant. O. umbellatum prefers damp habitats, being found along rivers, streams, and lower, wet areas of pastures. It is tolerant to shade and soil type. Ecology =Life cycle= Ornithogalum umbellatum is thermoperiodic, requiring a cold winter to complete its life cycle. It first appears in early spring as tufts of leaves, prior to flowering (proteranthous), which occurs in late spring (May‚ÄìJune), the leaves fading prior to blooming. It reproduces by its bulbs, which form many offsetting bulbils that can be dispersed by water. Like many bulb plants from temperate regions, a period of exposure to cold is necessary before spring growth can begin. This protects the plant from growth during winter when intense cold may damage it. Warmer spring temperatures then initiate growth from the bulb. O. umbellatum spreads aggressively in clumps by means of these offsets. =Pollination= The flowers are insect pollinated, but may also be self-fertile, forming seeds in summer (June‚ÄìJuly). Seed dispersal plays a relatively minor role in propagation, but accounts for isolated blooms. =Effect of light= The petals exhibit photoperiodism, often opening at noon and closing at night or on cloudy days. Cultivation alt=Leonardo da Vinci's Leda and the Swan, in which she holds a bouquet of Ornithogalum umbellatum in her hand Ornithogalum umbellatum requires considerable moisture during winter and spring, but can tolerate summer drought. It can be grown in a woodland garden as semi-shade is preferable. It is hardy to zone 5 UK, 4‚Äì9 USDA, and can become invasive. It is produced commercially as an ornamental garden plant. To control invasive tendencies, it is best to plant in a container or an edged area. O. umbellatum may be grown as an indoor plant. Toxicity The plant, especially the bulb and flowers, contains cardiac glycosides, specifically convallatoxin and convalloside which are toxic to humans and livestock. Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, salivation, vomiting, diarrhea, and shortness of breath, as well as pain, burning, and swelling of lips, tongue, and throat. Prolonged contact may lead to skin irritation. Uses Despite the known toxicities, the plant has been described as edible for 2000 years and incorporated into some traditional regional cuisines (e.g. Turkey) and traditional medicine (e.g. India). In Britain, the plant has long been the subject of herbals for its claimed culinary and medicinal properties. This includes drying and grinding the bulbs, or boiling them and baking the flowers into bread. Essences are sold as patent remedies and for aromatherapy, such as Bach flower remedies. Medical authorities advise against ingesting any part of the plant. In popular culture Leonardo da Vinci drawing of flowers Leonardo da Vinci drew O. umbellatum and included the plant in one of his depictions of Leda and the Swan (1508‚Äì1515), in which the flowers are held in Leda's left hand. In folklore, the biblical star of Bethlehem is said to have fallen to the earth and shattered into pieces which became the ubiquitous white flowers. Legend has also associated it with the journeys of Crusaders and pilgrims to the Holy Land. A biblical passage in 2 Kings 6:25 relates an account of a siege in Samaria in which the desperate population consumed the excrement of doves (chiriyonim). \\"There was a great famine in Samaria; and behold, they besieged it, until a donkey's head was sold for eighty shekels of silver, and a fourth of a kab of dove's dung for five shekels of silver\\". There has been considerable discussion as to the exact meaning of this term. In notes taken by Paul Dietrich Giseke from a lecture by Linnaeus it is suggested that this Stercus Columbarum was in fact the plant Ornithogalum umbellatum, which grew abundantly in Palestine and \\"unde Anglis Bethlem's Star dicitur\\" (is known to the English as Bethlem's Star), the white colour of which resembled the excrement of birds, hence the name lac Avium (bird milk or Ornithogalum), and which was still eaten by the poor of that country. Culturally, the flower has been associated with purity and hope, atonement and reconciliation.

Earlier scholars had discussed the question of \\"learned ignorance\\". Augustine of Hippo, for instance, stated \\"Est ergo in nobis quaedam, ut dicam, docta ignorantia, sed docta spiritu dei, qui adiuvat infirmitatem nostram\\"Epist. ad Probam 130, c. 15, ¬ß 28 \\\\- \\"There is therefore in us a certain learned ignorance, so to speak ‚Äî an ignorance which we learn from that Spirit of God who helps our infirmities\\"; here he explains the working of the Holy Spirit among men and women, despite their human insufficiency, as a learned ignorance.

For Cusanus, docta ignorantia means that since mankind can not grasp the infinity of a deity through rational knowledge, the limits of science need to be passed by means of speculation. This mode of inquiry blurs the borders between science and ignorantia. In other words, both reason and a supra-rational understanding are needed to understand God. This leads to the coincidentia oppositorum, a union of opposites, a doctrine common in mystic beliefs from the Middle Ages. These ideas influenced other Renaissance scholars in Cusanus' day, such as Pico della Mirandola.

He was the Bavarian Minister of Finance from 1931 to 1933, when the Nazis came to power in Berlin. In 1945 he became the first Minister- President of Bavaria to hold office after the end of the Second World War. From 1949 to 1957, he was the West German federal Minister of Finance and, from 1957 to 1961, federal Minister of Justice. Biography Fritz Sch√§ffer was born in 1888 as the son of Gottfried Sch√§ffer and Amalia Mayr. He went to school in Ingolstadt, Munich and Neuburg an der Donau, afterwards studying law in Munich. He joined as a volunteer the Bavarian Infanterie-Leib-Regiment in 1915. After service in Serbia and Tyrol, he was wounded at Verdun in May 1916 and released from army service. Sch√§ffer started working for the Bavarian state government in 1917. He married Else Dyroff in September 1917. He was imprisoned from 1933 until 1934, after which he worked as a lawyer. He was imprisoned again in Dachau concentration camp after the July 20 Plot until the end of World War II, from August to October 1944. Politics From 1918 to 1933, Sch√§ffer was a member of the BVP. In 1929 he became chairman of this Bavarian regionalist party. From 1920 to 1933, he was a member of the Landtag of Bavaria. In his early political career, he made some anti-Semitic speeches, a fact that would haunt him in his later political life. Nevertheless, he opposed the Nazis' rise to power in Bavaria and took part in the formation of the Bayernwacht in 1931, an organisation aimed at protecting conservative politicians from the SA. He aimed at forming a coalition, which would include the Nazi Party and the Centre Party, arguing that such a step would neutralise the Nazi party to some extent. After this failed, he attempted to elevate the last Bavarian crown prince, Rupprecht, to the dictatorial position of Staatskommissar. The move ultimately failed due to the resistance of Bavarian prime minister, Heinrich Held, who feared that Sch√§ffer would be made prime minister in his stead. In 1933, he found himself imprisoned for his actions against the Nazis. In 1945 he was among the founders of the CSU. He was engaged in continuous strife with the party leader, Josef M√ºller over party politics. M√ºller wished to make the party multi-confessional, while Sch√§ffer tried to move it towards a revival of the Catholic-dominated BVP. He was made the first postwar prime minister of Bavaria by General George S. Patton in 1945 but was relieved of his post by General Dwight D. Eisenhower after a couple of months, when his anti-Semitic past became known.

Murumuru butter, extracted from the seeds of the plant, may be used as a moisturizer. The murumuru palm trees grow in Brazil and around the Amazon and are one of the dominant trees in this region. It has a thick trunk and a shuttlecock-shaped, bushy crown. The nutritious, edible fruits are an important local food source and materials made from the tree, fruit, and seed kernels are commercially significant to the region. Hammocks are made from the tree‚Äôs fibres. Murumuru butter is moisturizing (emollient). It is also film-forming and glossy. These qualities make it very protective. It contains vitamins and has a high content of oleic acid. The oil from the seeds is traditionally used to soften and protect hair. Murumuru butter is the white to yellowish fat obtained from the seeds of the murumuru palm. Ecology The Murumuru palm (Astrocaryum murumuru) is abundant in the Brazilian Amazon, extending to the borders of Bolivia and Peru. It prefers to grow in periodically flooded areas, especially on islands and in lowlands along the rivers throughout the Amazon River estuary and its tributaries, in dense or semi-open forests.LORENZI, H. √Årvores Brasileiras., 2002, p.368 It is also frequently found in the lowlands of Marajo Island. The stem, leaves and fruit stalks are covered with hard, black spines that can reach over 20 cm in length, complicating fruit harvesting. When the fruit is ripe, the inflorescence (cluster of flowers) drops to the ground. The fruit contains a yellow flesh often consumed by rodents as food, which leave the seeds clean. The seed's hard shell is only separable from the kernel when dry. In general, 100 kg of dry seeds (12‚Äì15% water) yields 27 kg to 29 kg of kernels, which must be further dried to prevent deterioration during storage. These kernels then yield 40% to 42% oil. A single Murumuru palm produces about 11 kg of dry seeds. Hydraulic extraction can produce 35% oil relative to the dry weight of the kernel, which is equivalent to about 3.8 liters of oil per Murumuru palm. The kernels must be ground with grinding discs before hydraulic extraction. A kilogram of fruit pulp contains approximately 50 seeds. Seed germination is moderate and growth in the field is slow.MORAIS, L.: Banco de Dados Sobre Esp√©cies Oleaginosas da Amaz√¥nia, unpublished PINTO, G.P. Caracter√≠sticas f√≠sico-qu√≠micas e outras informa√ß√µes sobre as principais oleaginosas do Brasil. Recife: Instituto de Pesquisas e Experimenta√ß√£o Agropecu√°rias do Nordeste, Boletim T√©cnico 18, 1963. Astrocaryum murumuru butter Murumuru butter Murumuru butter contains lauric, myristic, and oleic acids. The fruit contains a white butter that is odorless and tasteless and has the advantage of not becoming rancid easily. The quality of Murumuru butter is similar to the seed fat of the Tucum√£ palm and coconut palm, but it has the advantage of providing greater consistency because of its melting point (33 C), which is superior to that of the Tucum√£ palm (30 ¬∞C) and coconut palm (22.7 ¬∞C). The quality of Murumuru butter makes it possible to mix it with other vegetable butters that have a lower melting point. It can also be used to partially substitute cocoa butter in chocolate, providing a firmer consistency in environments where the temperature is higher.. Murumuru butter has the great advantage of having a low acidity value (4% to 5%), especially when made from fresh seeds, which reduces the cost of refinement.PESCE, C. Oleaginosas da Amaz√¥nia, 1941, Oficinas Gr√°ficas da Revista Veterin√°ria, Bel√©m/PA. Murumuru butter was highly valued in Europe and the United States during the 1940s and 1950s, when it served as an ingredient in vegetable creams and soaps. Today, soaps containing Murumuru butter together with Ucuuba butter leave a protection layer on the skin similar to silicone, only it does not clog the pores. Murumuru butter is used in small amounts in shampoos (0.5% to 1%) and formulas for conditioners, creams, soaps, lipsticks and deodorants (0.5% to 8%).

During his adolescent years Nathan‚Äôs family traveled extensively due to his father‚Äôs military career. When his family eventually returned to Santa Clara Pueblo, Nathan learned to make pottery by watching his grandmother \\"the matriarch of Santa Clara potters,\\" Margaret Tafoya. Margaret taught him to make and burnish the pots, telling him to \\"take a little time especially with the polishing and you will be rewarded.\\" His grandfather Alcario Tafoya taught him designs and carving. His mother Mela was a successful potter, who, with Helen Shupla, introduced the melon-shaped pot in Southwestern art.Folwell et al, 24 Artwork Nathan has been making pottery since 1972. He creates black, red and tan traditional hand-coiled pottery in the form of jars, vases, bowls and canteens. He also makes carved and painted plates. His pots are generally large measuring above ten inches in diameter. Using traditional techniques Nathan often incorporates non-Tewa designs such as abstract shapes into his pieces. During the firing process Nathan uses the same traditional method as his grandmother. Each pot is fired individually so as not to risk destroying all of the pots at once should something happen during the firing process. Nathan has become a highly respected potter known for his creative designs and the exceptional quality of his work. Since 1976, he has won over 44 awards at the Santa Fe Indian Market, often winning 1st and 2nd place. In 1987 he received the Jack Hoover Memorial Award for excellence in Santa Clara pueblo pottery at Santa Fe Indian Market. Beginning in 1974, Nathan‚Äôs work has been exhibited at many gallery shows in Scottsdale, Arizona and Santa Fe, New Mexico. He participated in the Sid Deusch Gallery show in New York City in 1985. His work has been exhibited at the White House and the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C., the Heard Museum in Phoenix, Arizona, the Gilcrease Museum in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and the Denver Museum of Nature and Science in Denver, Colorado. Nathan has contributed much of his time to public services. He has served on the boards for the Gallup Inter-Tribal Ceremonial and the Southwestern Association for Indian Arts. Until recently he served on the Board of Directors for the Wheelwright Museum in Santa Fe. He has given lectures at various locations including the National Museum of American Art in Washington, D.C. and the Denver Museum of Natural History.

Also included in IRTF was a set of bit- manipulation functions which were eventually incorporated into MIL_STD-1753 for Fortran-77, and later into Fortran-90.  History  The IRTF standard evolved from a series of workshops held at Purdue University in the early 1970s. The Fortran committee created a proposal which was approved and published by the Instrument Society of America (ISA) as ISA Standard S61.1 (1972). The paper defined library calls for controlling the state of concurrently activated programs, process I/O, and bit manipulation. A second supplementary paper, ISA S61.2 (1973) was published a year later. This paper defined additional calls for random unformatted files, and bit manipulation. Additional work, including work on management of parallel tasks, was performed both in the U.S. as S61.3, and in Germany as Prozess-FORTRAN. In 1980, a joint American/European proposal was published. While IRTF held some influence in certain markets in the 1970s, by the early 1980s most process control systems were being built using microprocessor-based systems where Fortran was not available. Because of this, the IRTF bindings have fallen into disuse. Modern systems tend to use POSIX Threads instead.  References  * ISA S61.1 (1972) Standard.

In 1994, she was promoted to Sergeant and, two years later, a Lieutenant, before becoming a patrol supervisor. In 1999, she became a Captain and, later that year, was promoted to Inspector and placed in charge of the Department's Major Narcotics Branch/Gang Crime Unit. In August 2000, she was promoted to Commander-in-Charge of the Fourth District of the city. In April 2006, she became the Commander at the Office of Homeland Security and Counter-terrorism, Office of the Chief of Police in MPDC, overseeing, among other things, the bomb squad and the emergency response team. Lanier was criticized in July 2009 after claiming that motorists who used GPS navigation and smartphones to avoid traffic cameras were employing a \\"cowardly tactic\\". Lanier has defended the practice of arresting individuals reselling tickets to sporting events, even if the tickets were sold at face value.

Everard t'Serclaes (c. 1320 - 31 March 1388), lord of Kruikenburg (alternatively Cruyckembourg), was a citizen of Brussels, who was made famous by his recovery of that city from the Flemings. His brother, Jean, was bishop of Cambrai. After the death of John III of Brabant on 5 December 1355, his daughter Joanna and her husband, Wenceslaus, succeeded him as rulers of the duchy. Their succession was disputed by the count of Flanders, Louis de Male. Louis invaded Brabant and quickly seized Brussels. On the night of 24 October 1356, Everard scaled the city walls leading a group of patriots and drove the Flemings from the city. This enabled Joanna and Wenceslaus to make their Joyous Entry into the city. Everard was later made schepen (alderman) of the city five times. As an old man he led the successful opposition to the selling of a section of crown land to Sweder of Abcoude, lord of Gaasbeek. A group led by Sweder's illegitimate son ambushed, beat, and mutilated Everard on the road from Lennik to Brussels. He died five days later as a result of the attack. In response, the citizens of Brussels, joined by allies from across Brabant, razed Gaasbeek Castle. Everard is commemorated by a monument sculpted by artist Julien Dillens (1849-1904), which is located on Charles Buls street in Brussels, just off the Grand Place. It is said among locals that the statue of Everard t'Serclaes brings luck and grants the wishes of all who touch it. Many tourists touch (or rather rub) the statue, particularly the arm, because legend has it that rubbing the arm will ensure one's return to Brussels. Other parts are also touched frequently by the tourists such as the face of an angel, a dog, and one of the shields. This constant polishing keeps the body shining compared to the rest of the sculpture.

Before joining the League, Pagliarini worked as accountant and was close to the Radical Party, for its battle in favour of divorce. Anyway, he never joined that party, being only a voter, and so he made his first political experience in the League. Pagliarini is a moderate, sometimes dissenting with the party's social-conservative agenda, a libertarian, especially on economic issues, and a prominent supporter of fiscal federalism and fiscal conservatism. He was known as maverick politician and, prior to leaving Lega Nord, often criticized the line imposed by Umberto Bossi. Lately he dissented with the continuation of the alliance with the other House of Freedoms parties, favouring an autonomous path for the League, and flirted with the independentist wing of the party, led by Gilberto Oneto, a libertarian himself, and maintained relations with the Liberal Reformers. Giancarlo Pagliarini in 2006 On 19 January 2007 Pagliarini, who was not candidate for re-election in the 2006 general election, finally left Lega Nord. In June he took part to the libertarian network founded by Daniele Capezzone. On 18 January 2008 he unexpectedly joined The Right of Francesco Storace and then was candidated in Lombardy in the 2008 general election, despite declaring to be \\"leghista in the soul and the mind\\".Giancarlo Pagliarini - www.giancarlopagliarini.it He wasn't elected. He was a candidate for mayor of Milan for local elections in 2011, but he wasn't able to enter the runoff election. Subsequently he joined Act to Stop the Decline, a federalist and liberal party.

The process is most commonly observed in printed circuit boards where it may significantly decrease the insulation between conductors. The main factor facilitating the ECM is humidity. In the presence of water, ECM can go very quickly. Usually the process involves several stages: water adsorption, anode metal dissolution, ion accumulation, ion migration to cathode, and dendritic growth. The growth of the dendrite takes fraction of a second, during which time the resistance between anode and cathode drops almost to zero.http://www.aidic.it/cet/13/33/094.pdf See also *Whisker (metallurgy) References Category:Electrochemistry ","title":"Electrochemical migration"},{"id":"8035613","title":"Mustt Mustt"},{"id":"8035619","text":"Alden Lloyd Thompson is a Seventh-day Adventist Christian theologian, author, and seminar presenter.

In the central business district of Downtown Vancouver it is known as West Hastings Street; at Carrall Street it becomes East Hastings Street and runs eastwards through East Vancouver and Burnaby. In Burnaby, there is no east-west designation. The street ends in Westridge, a neighbourhood at the foot of Burnaby Mountain where it joins the recently built Burnaby Mountain Parkway and diverges from the continuation of the former Highway 7A as the Barnet Highway, to Port Moody, British Columbia.

Techniques developed in CLEVER included various forms of link analysis, including the HITS algorithm. Features The CLEVER search engine incorporates several algorithms that make use of the Web's hyperlink structure for discovering high-quality information. It can be exceedingly difficult to locate resources on the World Wide Web that are both high-quality and relevant to a user's informational needs. Traditional automated search methods for locating information on the Web are easily overwhelmed by low-quality and unrelated content. Second generation search engines have to have effective methods for focusing on the most authoritative documents. The rich structure implicit in hyperlinks among Web documents offers a simple, and effective, means to deal with many of these problems. Members of the Clever project have come up with a mathematical algorithm that views the Net as simply web pages pointing at each other. It also takes into account the notion of hubs, which point to quality content and link information together, and the idea of authority pages, which are often written by specialists in certain fields. Bill Cody, senior manager of exploratory data management research at IBM's Almaden Research Center, said: \\"Web searches provide a lot of information, some good, some bad. But the people providing good hubs usually point to authority pages and authority pages generally know of good hubs. The algorithm enables us to find them and so provide users with quality information rather than the regular list of irrelevant web pages.\\" He added that the algorithm had also been used to find Internet based communities using the same principle of finding links between like and like. It was used to discover 300,000 communities worldwide, only four per cent of which turned out to be spurious. About two thirds of these still existed, he claimed, with about half now appearing on Yahoo as mature communities. Cody said that the tool could be used for targeted advertising purposes or for enabling users to find out more information about incipient communities, but declined to say whether IBM had plans to turn Clever into a commercial product or not.

It is commonly called San Mateo thornmint or Dutton's acanthomintha and is found growing on serpentine soils near the Crystal Springs Reservoir in a six-mile (10 km) long strip on the east side of Montara Mountain at elevations of approximately 150 to 300 meters. Distribution This rare annual species of wildflower has populations that fluctuates yearly with recorded population ranges from 50,000 plants to as few as 5,000 plants and is considered critically endangered Jokerst, J.D. 1991. A revision of Acanthomintha obovata (Lamiaceae) and a key to the taxa of Acanthomintha. Madro√±o. 38: 278-286. due to the species narrow range of growing conditions and the fragmented nature of the populations over the limited habitat and by the encroachment of urban development.Andrew Kratter, Report of endangered species search and vegetative survey of the Polhemus Property at the northeast corner of the intersection of Ralston Avenue and State Route 92, San Mateo, Earth Metrics file reference 7649W0, prepared for San Mateo County, California, July, 1989 The species is named in honor of Harry Arnold Dutton (1873‚Äì1957), who, in 1949, located a patch of another rare plant Cupressus abramsiana on nearby Butano Ridge. Description =All Acanthomintha species= All four thornmint species are aromatic annual wildflowers native to the state of California in the US. The species have square stems that are erect growing. The leaves are petioled with leaf veins conspicuous and the leaf margins are often spiny. The inflorescences of the Acanthomintha genus are described as \\"head-like, in terminal clusters\\" by the genus authority James D. Jokerst.Jepson Manual, University of California Press (1993) The flowers of this entire genus are like, most mints, two-lipped forming a tube with five sepals and the stamens enclosed within the zygomorphic petals. The bracts in the inflorescence have marginal spines, thus the basis of the common name 'thornmints'. All Acanthomintha have the upper three lobes of its calyx acuminate and the lower two lobes oblong in shape; furthermore, all Acanthomintha corollae are funnel shaped and white with occasional tinting of purple. Each Acanthomintha species has four stamens, with the upper two reduced. Thornmint styles are slender and their fruit is ovoid in shape with a smooth exterior texture. =Acanthomintha duttonii= A. duttonii has a stem which is generally unbranched and less than twenty centimeters in length; the stem may present short hairs or none at all. Leaves of this species are eight to twelve millimeters in length, lanceolate to obovate in shape. The margins of this spiny leaf are occasionally serrate. The terminal inflorescences have bracts of about five to eleven millimeters; moreover, these bracts are ovate and green at the flower, with five or seven marginal spines, each three to seven millimeters. The virtually hairless to sparse short haired calyx is five to eight millimeters in length, while the corolla is 12 to 16 millimeters in extent. The white corolla is often tinged lavender in color; the corolla throat is cream colored and its upper lip is hooded, while the longer lower lip is reflexed and three-lobed. The upper lip is more diminutive than the lower, and is entire and shallowly hooded. The flower bracts are broadly ovate in shape with puberulent hairs and shiny. The bracts have seven to nine spines each. The anthers are short and hairy. The style is glabrous. Plants bloom in April into late June, with each flower when fertilized producing four nut-like seeds. Plants are self-fertile. A. duttonii upper stamens are fertile, while the other species have sterile upper stamens. The presence of these fertile upper stamens is used to separate it as a different species from Acanthomintha obovata, in the past A. duttonii was referred to as subspecies of A. obovata (Acanthomintha obovata ssp. duttonii). Distribution and habitat This species is normally associated with serpentine soils in grassland communities that are generally species-rich for serpentine soils; the area they are growing in on the San Francisco Peninsula also contains sloping chaparral. Other native species that grow in the same area include Nasella pulchra, Delphinium hesperium, and Hemizonia congesta var. luzulifolia, plus the exotic Lolium multiflorum. The range of this species is sharply limited within a portion of central San Mateo County on the eastern lower slopes of the Santa Cruz Mountains.California Department of Fish and Game, California Natural Diversity Data Base, San Mateo and Woodside quadrangles Specific plant communities where this species is found are chaparral as well as foothill or valley grasslands. San Mateo thornmint populations occupy slopes or flatland with deep, heavy clay soil inclusions. The single remaining large population, in Edgewood County Park, is a relict of a more extensive colony damaged by off-road motor-vehicle use. There is an introduced population at Pulgas Ridge Open Space Preserve,Pavlik, B., E. Espeland and F. Wittman. 1992. Creating new populations of Acanthomintha duttonii. II: Reintroduction at Pulgas Ridge, California Department of Fish and Game, 35 pp and native fragments along the lower slopes above Crystal Springs Reservoir in a six-mile-long (10 km) fragmented strip that includes the Edgewood colony. This species is only known to grow on serpentine soils. Serpentine soils normally provide an inhospitable environment for most plants. Several factors contribute to serpentine soils being inhospitable to plant growth including a low calcium-magnesium ratio, lack of essential nutrients namely nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus, and high concentrations of heavy metals. However, for this particular serpentine species, the ideal soil nutrient threshold levels required for its seedling's survival, have not been determined yet.Dremann, Craig Carlton. Notes on California Native plants and their Soil-Nutrient Threshold-requirements for Seedling Survival. Unpublished Notebooks. Conversely, many species that have adapted to grow on serpentine soils have formed genetically-fixed ecotypes that are not adapted to compete with other plants and do not survive well under competition in other soils that tend to have denser plant numbers; in serpentine soils plant densities are lower resulting in less direct competition for resources like light and water.Dremann, Craig Carlton. 1996, updated 2011. \\"Native Grass Ecotypes and their Revolutionary Implications for Geneticists, Biodiversity, Conservation, Taxonomy, Evolutionary Sciences, and Ecological Restoration.\\" http://www.ecoseeds.com/juicy.gossip.three.html Conservation This species became state of California listed as endangered in July 1979 and federally listed as endangered on October 18, 1989. The state of California lists San Mateo Thornmint as \\"rare, threatened, or endangered in California\\" under List 1B.1, and further classifies this plant as \\"seriously endangered in California\\". A state of California endangerment rank of S1.1 has been assigned, implying that there are fewer than six occurrences, fewer than 1000 individuals or fewer than 2000 acres (8 km¬≤). In the case of A. duttonii, the criteria of occurrences and area may both be present. A global rank of G1 (Critically imperilled globally) has been attached to this wildflower. Significant threats to the limited population of A. duttonii exist due to continuing urbanization of the San Francisco Peninsula, an inherently fragmented population and off-road vehicle use.Recovery Plan for Serpentine Soil Species of the San Francisco Bay Area, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Portland, Oregon, September 30, 1998 Two and possibly three colonies of San Mateo Thornmint have been eradicated in the last two decades by off-road vehicle use and road maintenance crews.

Life He was born of noble parents at Volkersdorf in Styria, and entered the monastery of Admont about 1267. Four years later he was sent to Prague to study grammar and logic. After devoting himself for two years to these studies he spent nine years at the University of Padua studying philosophy and theology. In 1297 he was elected Abbot of Admont, and after ruling thirty years he resigned this dignity when he was almost eighty years old, in order to spend the remainder of his life in prayer and study. Engelbert was one of the most learned men of his times, and there was scarcely any branch of knowledge to which his versatile pen did not contribute its share. Works His literary productions include works on moral and dogmatic theology, philosophy, history, political science, Holy Scripture, the natural sciences, pedagogy, and music.The Benedictine, Bernard Pez, mentions thirty- eight works, many of which he published partly in his \\"Thesaurus anecdotorum novissimus\\" (Augsburg, 1721), partly in his \\"Bibliotheca ascetica antiquo- nova\\" (Ratisbon, 1723-5). The best known of Engelbert's works is his historico-political treatise De ortu, progressu et fine Romani imperii, which was written during the reign of Emperor Henry VII (1308‚Äì1313). It puts forth the following political principles: a ruler must be a learned man; his sole aim must be the welfare of his subjects; an unjust ruler may be justly deposed; emperor and pope are, each in his sphere, independent rulers; the Holy Roman Empire is a Christian continuation of the pagan empire of ancient Rome; there should be only one supreme temporal ruler, the emperor, to whom all other temporal rulers should be subject. He bewails the gradual decline of both imperial and papal authority, prophesies the early coming of Antichrist and with it the ruin of the Holy Roman Empire and a wholesale desertion of the Holy See.Antony Black, Political Thought in Europe 1250-1450 (1992). p. 93, states that Engelbert was the first to ground the argument for Empire on the new range of political arguments and concepts available from Aristotle. The work was published repeatedly.First according to the revision of Cluten (Offenbach, 1610); finally it was re-edited by Schott and printed in the Supplement to the Magna Bibliotheca Veterum Patrum (Cologne, 1622; p.688) and in Maxima Bibliotheca veterum Patrum (Lyons, 1677).

His scientific research contributed to the understanding of the large-scale structure of the northern Appalachian mountains of Atlantic Canada. Neale used his enthusiasm for geology to inform students and the general public about discoveries in his field through television, radio, pamphlets, booklets, news magazines, and the popular press. Neale worked with the Geological Survey of Canada and Memorial University of Newfoundland. He, along with John Rodgers of Yale University, were the first to recognize the transported oceanic sedimentary rocks that overlie ancient shelf deposits in western Newfoundland. Early life Neale was born in Beaconsfield, Qu√©bec in July 1923. He served in the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War between 1943-1945. After the war he went to study at McGill University, Montreal. He completed his BSc in 1949. In 1950, Ward married Roxie and they moved to New Haven, Connecticut so Ward could attend Yale University. There he obtained his MSc. (1951) and PhD (1952). Career Neale worked briefly as an Assistant Professor at the University of Rochester, New York, between 1952 and 1954. After that he went on to work for the Geological Survey of Canada. His first position was as to head the Appalachian Geology Section. Between 1963 and 1965, Neale served as the Commonwealth Geology Liaison Officer. When he returned he was given the responsibility to head the Precambrian Geology Section. In 1968, Neale left the Survey to become Professor and head of the Geology Department at Memorial University of Newfoundland. In 1972, he organized a Montreal-based symposium for the International Geological Congress on Geoscience Aid to developing Countries. This symposium led to the creation of the Association of Geoscientists for International Development. In 1976, Neale moved to Calgary as Head of the Geological Information Subdivision of the Institute of Sedimentary and Petroleum Geology. He retained his ties to academia whilst in Calgary by holding an adjunct position at the University of Calgary and acting on the University Senate.

I-10 traverses southern New Mexico through Hidalgo, Grant, Luna, and Do√±a Ana counties. The Interstate travels west‚Äìeast from the Arizona state line to the interchange with I-25 in Las Cruces, and then travels north‚Äìsouth to the Texas state line. US Route 80 in New Mexico (US 80) was replaced by Interstate 10. Route description I-10 enters Hidalgo County, New Mexico from Cochise County, Arizona as a four lane divided highway. The highway travels east through rural southwest New Mexico, passing between Steins Mountain and Attorney Mountain, part of the Peloncillo Mountains, before passing by the ghost town of Steins. Continuing east, the northern terminus of New Mexico State Road 80 (NM 80) is intersected, serving Rodeo, followed by NM 338\\\\. Passing Lee Peak the highway turns southeast entering Lordsburg. US 70 is intersected in town, and becomes concurrent with the highway as it continues east past the Lordsburg Municipal Airport, before exiting the town. Near the Grant County line the highway bypasses the ghost town called Shakespeare. Entering Grant County, the highway continues southeast then northeast after intersecting NM 146\\\\. The highway passes over the Continental Divide on the Grant-Luna county line. Continuing east, the highway intersects the city of Deming and the highway becomes concurrent with US 180 as the three highways continue east. The highway enters Do√±a Ana County as it approaches Las Cruces. US 70 exits the highway as it enters the city (becoming Picacho Avenue), and the Interstate begins to turn south. Just south of the New Mexico State University campus, I-10 has a junction with the southern terminus of I-25. At the I-25 junction, I-10/U.S. Route 180 also becomes concurrent with US 85\\\\. At this point, the highway is now headed almost due south before crossing into Anthony, Texas (in El Paso County, Texas) from Anthony, New Mexico (in Do√±a Ana County). *Note: the speed limit has increased from on I-10 from Mesquite to Anthony at the Texas state line, and I-10 south of Las Cruces is now three lanes in each direction. Interstate 10, west of Las Cruces, New Mexico. History I-10 replaced US 80 through New Mexico, bypassing major portions of old US 80 in the western portion of the state and in Do√±a Ana County. US 80 was one of the original United States Numbered Highways established in 1926. The portion of US 80 between the Arizona state line and Anthony was decommissioned on October 6, 1989, while the remainder of the route though the state was removed October 12, 1991. From 1927 to 1960, the section of Interstate 10 between Road Forks and the Arizona state line was designated New Mexico State Road 14 (NM 14). Though it was only long, NM 14 and its Arizona counterpart, SR 86, served as a direct bypass for US 80 between Road Forks and Benson, Arizona. US 80 itself looped south to Douglas, Arizona at the Mexico-US border between Road Forks and Benson. By the late 1940s, NM 14 had been paved and carried the majority of US 80 traffic by 1950. With the advent of I-10, NM 14 was removed from the state road system in 1960. The Interstate was first numbered I-10 by the American Association of State Highway Officials, in cooperation with the Department of Commerce, in 1957.

Its entire length is concurrent with U.S. Highway 277 and U.S. Highway 281. I-44 provides access to downtown Wichita Falls and Sheppard Air Force Base. Interstate 44 is known as Central Freeway in Wichita Falls and Red River Expressway in Burkburnett. Route description I-44 begins near exit 1 in Wichita Falls concurrent with US 277, US 281 and US 287. US 281 and US 287 continue to the south while US 277 leaves the concurrency at exit 1, which also provides access to US 82. I-44 heads north through Wichita Falls to an interchange with US 287 and Spur 325. US 287 leaves the concurrency as a freeway to the west while Spur 325 leaves the interchange towards the northeast providing access to Sheppard Air Force Base and Wichita Falls Municipal Airport. I-44 continues to the north as it leaves the Wichita Falls city limits at Bacon Switch Road. The freeway enters the Burkburnett city limits south of an interchange at FM 3429. Heading north through the city, I-44 has interchanges with SH 240 and Spur 383. After passing Spur 383, I-44 begins to head towards the northeast before its final interchange in Texas at Loop 267. I-44 leaves the state of Texas at its crossing of the Red River and enters Oklahoma. History I-44 was signed south from Oklahoma City past I-40, along the H. E. Bailey Turnpike, in 1982. This expanded the interstate by some to Texas. This additional signage included the Red River Expressway in Burkburnett and the Central Freeway in Wichita Falls, to 8th street (being concurrent with US 277/281/287). For many years, the freeway ended here, forcing traffic to exit onto the service roads. In the early 2000s, the Central Freeway was extended through the downtown area, connecting directly to the Central East Freeway via the Lloyd Ruby Overpass.

The game is styled after campy science fiction B movies of the 1950s. It was ported to the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, MS-DOS, SAM Coup√©, and ZX Spectrum.  Gameplay  SAM Coup√© version According to the introduction, Planet X is a synthetic industrial planetoid whose most notable feature is the research laboratory of the buxom and brainy Dr. Sarah Bellum. Evil aliens called Reptilons invade the planet, capture the good doctor, and force the rest of the humans to manufacture a robot army to take over the Earth. Escape From The Planet Of The Robot Monsters is a one or two-player game in which the players must rescue Dr. Sarah Bellum from Planet X, where her research facility has been taken over by the evil Reptilons. The game is played from an isometric perspective where players control their avatars using Hall effect joysticks on the arcade version. The player must shoot their way through a series of simple maze-like levels, releasing the human hostages along the way. Levers must be found and thrown to activate the escalators which allow access to new areas. Gems can be collected to increase the power of the player's ray gun, and food lockers may be broken into for a health boost. At the end of each level the play switches to an isometric auto-scrolling sequence in which the player controls his character in a small spaceship, and must steer left or right to navigate through a maze of obstacles. If the player reaches the end of this sequence they will progress to the next level. =Controllers= Players control their avatars using Hall effect joysticks, a form of analog joysticks. This allows players to aim in 16 directions (22.5¬∞ apart) instead of the 45¬∞ directional control offered by traditional 8-way joysticks. There are 3 buttons; fire, duck and jump.

Waters was regarded as one of the NFL's hardest-hitting defenders, serving as an integral part of one of the league's top defenses. On November 20, 2006, Waters committed suicide and was subsequently diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Early years Waters was born in Belle Glade, Florida and grew up in extreme poverty in rural Florida, and attended Pahokee High School. Waters received some attention in high school but ended up attending Cheyney University At Cheyney University of Pennsylvania Waters was recognized as All-PSAC three straight years. NFL career  In 1984, Waters was signed as an undrafted free agent by Philadelphia Eagles head coach Marion Campbell. He returned a kickoff for an 89-yard game-winning touchdown against the Washington Redskins as a rookie in 1984. When Buddy Ryan took over for Campbell in 1986, he welcomed Waters' aggressive style as a fierce tackler and ferocious hitter, earning Waters a position in the starting lineup for the next eight years. He blossomed under defensive coordinator Bud Carson. His tackle of Los Angeles Rams quarterback Jim Everett in 1988 led to a rule prohibiting defensive players from hitting quarterbacks below the waist while they are still in the pocket; for a while, it was unofficially termed the \\"Andre Waters Rule\\". NFL broadcaster Dan Dierdorf notoriously nicknamed the Eagles defender \\"Dirty Waters\\". He scored a touchdown in 1989 when he took a lateral from William Frizzell after Reggie White caused a fumble by New York Giants quarterback Phil Simms. Waters served as part of the Eagles' defensive unit that was regarded as one of the league's all-time best, in 1991 ranking first statistically in both run and pass defense, as well as total defense. His hard-hitting style translated into leading the team in tackles for four seasons and endeared him with Philadelphia fans but often led to penalties and fines for some of his tackles. He led the Eagles in tackles in 1986, 1987, 1988 and 1991. He recorded 15 interceptions in 156 games. In 1994, he was replaced by Mike Zordich due to his contract ending.  Coaching career  After retiring as a player, Waters worked as a college football coach. In 1996, he joined the staff of Stump Mitchell at Morgan State as defensive backs coach. The following year under head coach Jim Leavitt, Waters took the same position on the upstart South Florida football program. He remained in that position until 1999. In 2000, Waters left South Florida to join the St. Louis Rams of the NFL as a coaching intern for training camp. In 2006, the St. Petersburg Times reported that Leavitt made Waters choose between South Florida and the internship out of concern that Waters would miss too much preparation time with South Florida. After his Rams internship, Waters returned to Tampa to be defensive coordinator at Paul R. Wharton High School in 2000. In 2001, Waters moved back to the college level as defensive backs coach at Alabama State. He later coached at St. Augustine's from 2002 to 2005 as defensive coordinator upon the football program's return from a 35-year hiatus. In 2006, Waters was defensive coordinator at Fort Valley State. In 2002, Waters joined the Detroit Lions in his second stint as an NFL coaching intern. In 2006, Waters described his disappointment in not getting a full- time NFL coaching job to The Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Phil Sheridan. He remained very close to his former Eagles coach Buddy Ryan, whom Waters said he tried to emulate in his own coaching career. Death Waters committed suicide shortly after 1 a.m. on November 20, 2006, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, dying of a gunshot to the head. He was at his home in Tampa, Florida where he was discovered by his girlfriend. He was buried at Foreverglades Cemetery in Belle Glade, Florida. Shortly after Waters' death, former Harvard defensive tackle and WWE wrestler Christopher Nowinski, whose wrestling career was ended by post-concussion syndrome and has since written a book about the dangers of concussions in contact sports, approached Waters' family and asked permission to have his brain tissue examined. After receiving permission, Nowinski had samples of Waters' brain tissue sent to neuropathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu at the University of Pittsburgh. Omalu believed, having examined the tissue, that Waters sustained brain damage from playing football: he went on to state that this led to Waters' depression. Omalu determined that Waters' brain tissue had developed chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and degenerated into that of an 80-year-old man with Alzheimer's disease, caused or hastened by the numerous concussions Waters sustained playing football. Waters was portrayed by actor Richard T. Jones in the 2015 film Concussion.

Directed by John Carpenter, the episode stars Caitlin Wachs as a pregnant woman who seeks to abort an unborn demon within her, while her gun-toting father (Ron Perlman) tries to prevent her from doing so. The episode's score was composed by Carpenter's son Cody. Plot Angelique (Caitlin Wachs) is taken to an abortion clinic to end her pregnancy, the product of a demonic rape. However, her father, Dwayne (Ron Perlman) who is against abortion, and three brothers set out to ensure that the baby lives, after the father is given messages from God telling him to save the baby. In the end, Angelique gives birth to a demonic creature. The demon father (Derek Mears) rises from the ground and kills some of the staff, one of the brothers, and Dwayne (after he realizes that it was the demon who told him to save the baby). The baby is shot in the head by Angelique, as the baby recognizes her as the mother, and then the demon father, seemingly grieving over its death, goes back to Hell with the corpse. Angelique then ends the episode by saying \\"God's will is done.\\" Home media The episode was released on DVD March 20, 2007.

It was a term used in British philosophy around in the early 1900s.G E Moore, 'External and Internal Relations', Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society (1919‚Äì20); reprinted in G E Moore, Philosophical Studies (1922)Russell ‚ÄòPragmatism‚Äô (1909) and ‚ÄòThe Monistic Theory of Truth‚Äô (1906‚Äì07) Overview Some relations are clearly internal in the sense that, for example, four would not be four unless it were related to two in the way it is. Some relations are internal to their bearers under one description but not under another, for example, a wife would not be a wife unless suitably related to a husband, but Mary would still be Mary had she not married. Or take the internal relation where Jack is taller than his wife, Joan. Here the relation is internal to both of them together, in symbolic form it can be given as: Jack(R)Joan, where R is the ordered relation of \\"Taller than\\". The doctrine that all relations are internal implies that everything has some relation, however distant, to everything else. Such a doctrine is ascribed by Bertrand Russell and G. E. Moore to certain ideas by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and the American philosopher, C. S. Peirce. Russell associates it with pragmatism, objective idealism and the absolute idealism of Hegel. It also refers to coherentism, a holist approach to truth. A contemporary of Russell, the English philosopher, Alfred North Whitehead, maintained the necessity of a doctrine of internal relations for the theory of evolution: > \\"This material is in itself the ultimate substance. Evolution, on the > materialistic theory, is reduced to the role of being another word for the > description of the changes of the external relations between portions of > matter. There is nothing to evolve, because one set of external relations is > as good as any other set of external relations. There can merely be change, > purposeless and unprogressive. But the whole point of the modem doctrine is > the evolution of the complex organisms from antecedent states of less > complex organisms. The doctrine thus cries aloud for a conception of > organism as fundamental for nature. It also requires an underlying activity > -- a substantial activity -- expressing itself in achievements of > organism.\\"Whitehead, 1925, pages 151‚Äì152. In the 1925 (first) edition of > Whitehead's Science and the Modern World the cited paragraph is on p. 135.

The game uses Valve's proprietary Source engine, and is available for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and Mac OS X. Development on the game was completed on November 13, 2008, and two versions were released digitally: A downloadable digital version, released on November 17, 2008, and a digital retail disc version, with a release date determined by region. The digital retail disc version was released in North America and Australia on November 18, 2008; and in Europe on November 21, 2008. Set during the aftermath of a worldwide zombie outbreak, the game puts its four protagonists‚Äîdubbed the \\"Survivors\\"‚Äîagainst hordes of the infected. There are four game modes: a single-player mode in which allied characters are controlled by AI; a four-player, co-op campaign mode; an eight-player online versus mode; and a four-player survival mode. In all modes, an artificial intelligence (AI), dubbed the \\"Director\\", controls level pacing and item placements, in an attempt to create a dynamic experience and increase replay value. Left 4 Dead was well received by the industry media upon its release, with praise given for its replay value, focus on cooperative play, and movie- like experience. Several criticisms were aimed at the limited level selection and the lack of a narrative. The game has won several publication awards, as well as distinctions from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences and British Academy of Film and Television Arts. As was done with Team Fortress 2, Valve supplemented the game with free downloadable content. The first, called the \\"Survival Pack\\", was released on April 21, 2009. The second piece of DLC was charged for on Xbox Live and came in the form of a new Campaign entitled \\"Crash Course,\\" released for both the PC and Xbox 360 on September 29, 2009. Left 4 Dead was released for the Mac on October 28, 2010. The popularity of the game led to the development of a sequel, Left 4 Dead 2, which was released on November 17, 2009. A new map for both Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2, called \\"The Sacrifice\\", was released on October 5, 2010. In July 2012, all Left 4 Dead campaigns were ported over to Left 4 Dead 2, with cross-platform multiplayer support between Windows and Mac versions of the game. Plot Pennsylvania suffers an outbreak of the \\"Green Flu\\", a highly contagious pathogen that causes extreme aggression, mutation to the body cells, and loss of higher brain functions (essentially zombifying those who catch the flu). Two weeks after the first infection, four immune survivors‚ÄîWilliam \\"Bill\\" Overbeck (voiced by Jim French), a Green Beret and Vietnam veteran; Zoey (voiced by Jen Taylor), a college student; Louis (voiced by Earl Alexander), a district account manager, and Francis (voiced by Vince Valenzuela), an outlaw biker‚Äîmake their way out of the city of Fairfield, only to discover that the infection is creating dangerous mutations in some of its hosts. After narrowly avoiding these new infected (as seen in the introduction video), the survivors are alerted to an evacuation point at the roof of Mercy Hospital by a passing helicopter. Fighting their way through the city's streets, subway and sewers, they are rescued from the hospital's roof by the pilot, only to discover he is infected. Zoey is forced to kill him, and the helicopter crashes in an industrial district outside the city. Finding an armored delivery truck, the group uses it to reach the town of Riverside. However, they find the road blocked, and travel the rest of the way on foot. After encountering a hostile and delirious man (voiced by Nathan Vetterlein) in the local church, they discover that the town is overrun, and head to a boathouse for rescue. Contacting a small fishing vessel, they are left at the city of Newburg on the other side of the river, finding much of it in flames. Resting in a large greenhouse, the survivors are interrupted by a military C-130 Hercules passing overhead, leading them to believe it landed at the city's airport. In an attempt to contain the infection, the military had bombed the airport, though the runway is partially intact, allowing the survivors to fuel up and escape in the waiting C-130. Despite this apparent rescue, the plane crashes as well, and the survivors find themselves at the outskirts of Allegheny National Forest. Following a series of train tracks, the group finally reaches a functioning, but abandoned, military outpost. After answering a radio transmission, the survivors make their final stand against hordes of infected, before a military APC arrives to (supposedly) transport them to Northeast Safe Zone Echo, one of the few remaining safe areas. Instead, (as seen in The Sacrifice comic), they are detained in a military installation, where they learn that they are not immune - they are asymptomatic carriers, and have infected most of their rescuers. Meanwhile, the base is overthrown by a mutiny, resulting in hordes of infected. The survivors escape via train and travel south at Bill's insistence; he believes that they can find long-term safety on the islands of the Florida Keys. At the portside town of Rayford, they find a sailboat, but must first raise a lift bridge powered by an aging generator to reach open waters. However, the generator gives out. Bill sacrifices himself to restart it, so that the others may reach safety. While waiting for the horde to disperse, the three then encounter four more survivors. They agree to move the boat to the other side of the bridge, and help them re-lower the bridge, so they can cross in their car. Afterwards, Louis, Zoey, and Francis return to the boat and set course to the Keys. Gameplay In Left 4 Dead, the four survivors must fight off infected humans while trying to escape/make their way to a safe house/a rescue vehicle. Left 4 Dead is a first-person shooter in which the player takes control of one of four survivors; if human players are not available, then the remaining survivors are AI-controlled bots. They play through the levels fighting off the infected‚Äîliving humans who have been infected with a rabies-like virus that causes psychosis. The virus does not affect them but they can transmit it to others as carriers. The game focuses on cooperation and teamwork and thus eschews some \\"realism\\" conventions usual in most FPS games of the wider genre. Colored outlines of teammates are visible through walls to help players stick together and coordinate their movement. If a survivor falls off a ledge, then they may automatically hang onto it and can only be helped up by another survivor. If a survivor's health is depleted, then they become incapacitated and can only be revived by another survivor, at which point they continue playing with a low amount of health that decreases over time. If a survivor has been incapacitated and revived twice without tending to their wounds, then they will experience distorted black-and-white vision, and the next incapacitation will kill the character. If a survivor takes enough damage while incapacitated, or is not eventually helped up by teammates, then the incapacitated character will die. During \\"Campaign\\" mode, if a survivor is killed, then they will respawn in a closet or other enclosed space after a period of time (except during key points in the scenario), but must be freed by another survivor to rejoin the team. Otherwise, the player must wait until the next level. The AI is incapable of accessing the \\"respawn closets\\", so if all human player survivors are killed or incapacitated, players will have to restart from the last checkpoint. Survivors can share first-aid kits and pain pills and help each other heal. Left 4 Dead has friendly fire (which causes no damage on the easy difficulty mode), increasing the need for caution around other survivors. The survivors communicate by voice commands that are accessed by quick menus, and some may sound off automatically when performing actions such as reloading or spotting infected. Over 1,000 unique lines have been recorded for each survivor. Additional communication of player actions is conveyed through character lights. Also, weapon-mounted flashlights and muzzle flashes help the players in determining whether their companions are shooting, performing melee attacks, reloading or moving. Due to control issues and the likelihood of players using a headset, the Xbox 360 version of Left 4 Dead omits the quick phrases feature. The game is experienced through six campaigns that take place in various urban and rural locales. Multiple visual in-game hints‚Äîincluding license plates, park signs, markings on airport equipment, and lines of dialogue spoken by the survivors‚Äîsuggest that these locations are in Pennsylvania, and similarly a memorial wall giving names of those who have died in the infection (actually names of the game's development team) along with their dates of birth and death suggests that the game takes place in October 2009. Each campaign is divided into five chapters (except Crash Course, which has two chapters, and The Sacrifice, which has three) marked by safe rooms, which are checkpoints where players can heal, re-arm and revive characters who were killed. Specifically, the four campaigns are: \\"No Mercy\\", an urban setting culminating in a hospital skyscraper; \\"Death Toll\\", a small- town and countryside setting; \\"Dead Air\\", an airport setting; and \\"Blood Harvest\\", a woodland and farm setting. A two-level campaign, \\"Crash Course\\", was released on September 29, and is set in the outskirts of a small industrial town. While The Sacrifice is a three-level campaign released on October 5 in 2010, with an industrial port-side setting in Georgia. The levels have distinct beginnings and ends, but there are a number of alternate routes to follow with more supplies, helping to create a sense of non-linearity. In the final chapter of each campaign, the players must defend a position from an onslaught of infected until rescue arrives. Each campaign typically lasts between 20 and 75 minutes depending on the difficulty level. Both platform versions of the game utilize an achievement system. =Survivor characters= The final design of the survivors, shown on the poster for the \\"No Mercy\\" campaign. Left to right: Francis, Bill, Zoey, Louis There are four protagonists of the game: Francis, an outlaw biker (voiced by Vince Valenzuela), Bill, a Vietnam Veteran (voiced by Jim French), Zoey, a university student (voiced by Jen Taylor) and Louis, a district account manager (voiced by Earl Alexander). Early plans were for players to be randomly assigned to characters but in the final release, players can choose any character‚Äîprovided that the character has not already been selected‚Äîor be randomly assigned an unselected character. Aside from appearances, all of the characters play exactly the same in-game. =Weapons= Survivors are armed with various firearms. Each player starts the game with a semiautomatic pistol. It may be reloaded an unlimited number of times and is the only weapon that the survivor can use when they are incapacitated. When a second pistol is found, the player can dual wield them, also with unlimited ammo. At the beginning of each campaign, the player can choose between a submachine gun and a pump-action shotgun. As the survivors progress through a campaign, more powerful weapons can be found: the fully automatic assault rifle (an upgrade to the submachine gun), a semi-automatic shotgun (an upgrade to the pump- action shotgun), and a scoped hunting rifle. A flashlight that can be toggled on and off is mounted on each firearm, with the exception of additional pistols. In addition to firearms, a player can also carry three other items in their inventory: improvised grenades (either a Molotov cocktail or a pipe bomb modified with an attached smoke alarm designed to attract the infected to it before it explodes); a first aid kit, which can be used to heal any survivor and pain pills, which provide temporary health that depletes gradually and quicker with damage from infected, and can be handed to teammates for later use. Regardless of what weapon or item a player is using, a melee attack can be used to shove away any infected within reach. Also available are environmental weapons, such as gas cans, propane cylinders, and oxygen tanks, all of which explode when shot. These environmental weapons can be picked up, moved, and used as a melee weapon by the survivors, but while carrying an object they cannot use their weapons or health items. Strategically placed minigun turrets are also encountered at various locations throughout the different maps. =Infected characters= The infected (voiced by experimental musician Mike Patton and voice actor Fred Tatasciore) are the survivors' foes in Left 4 Dead, and they appear to be partly inspired by the infected from several modern films, including Dawn of the Dead, 28 Days Later, and Quarantine. An important distinction from the former is that while the infected do resemble traditional undead zombies, they are, as cited in the game's manual, living humans infected with a rabies-like pathogen, very much like the infected in the latter two films. While they are never seen eating human flesh or brains, multiple 'survivors' who have been killed by the infected appear throughout the game, and appear to have been partially eaten. In The Sacrifice comic, Zoey's mother is bitten in the face. She then begins to attack the rest of her family. One such victim can be heard saying \\"I can't believe he bit me!\\" before being encountered later on, fully infected. In an interview with 1Up.com, Mike Booth commented on the concept of using a pathogen as an inspiration for the setting: The common infected encountered during the game are fast and agile, weak individually, but may be overwhelming in numbers. They display a special attraction to high-pitched alarm-type sounds, such as the beeping device attached to pipe bombs and car alarms. Common infected will often chase down the source of these noises while ignoring lower-pitched, but much louder sounds such as gunfire. They occasionally attack in masses referred to in-game as a \\"horde\\". In addition to the common infected, there are five \\"special\\" or \\"boss\\" infected whose mutations grant them special attacks that make them far more dangerous. Each of the special infected, as well as approaching hordes, have a distinctive sound or a timely musical cue, making their presence easily recognizable by players. There are five special infected in Left 4 Dead. * The Boomer is a bloated infected that can spit vision-impairing bile on the Survivors. This bile attracts hordes of common infected to the biled character(s), and he explodes on death, spewing more bile in the immediate area. They emit burping and vomiting like sounds when close by. A 5-note cue plays to signal the Boomer, on double bass if far away, and on low piano if nearby. * The Hunter is an agile foe that can jump and pounce on a survivor, and then tear at his victim until he is knocked off, kills his prey or is killed. A hunter emits animal like screeches or light roars when close by, and a snarling growl can be heard when in close proximity. The Hunter is signaled by a startling high- pitched, three-note cue on strings or piano. * The Smoker is a boil-covered creature with six long tongues that he uses to ensnare and drag a survivor back to himself. He may then either attack the survivor directly, allow the horde to attack him, or leave the survivor suspended over a cliff or roof- edge. The Smoker only releases his victim if a teammate shoves the ensnared survivor, if the tongue is shot, the survivor is killed, or upon the Smoker's death, which results in an explosion that leaves a vision-obscuring cloud. Smokers have raspy voices and frequently wheeze and cough, presuming that they may have been an avid smoker before becoming an Infected. A 2-note low cello or piano cue signals the Smoker. * The Tank is a gigantic, muscular infected that has the ability to swipe at survivors, knocking them off their feet and incapacitating them; he can also throw rocks and knock cars and other debris into the survivors. The Tank looks like his lower jaw is missing, but it's actually hidden in his neck muscle. The Tank is the most durable of all the special infected, and requires the full support of all of the survivors in order to be killed. The Tank is accompanied by a booming orchestral score to signal his appearance. * The Witch is a female infected with long claws that stays crying in one spot. Survivors can often avoid the Witch but if they disturb her with light, loud noises, gunfire, or remain too close to her for a period of time, she will become aggressive and charge at the one who \\"startled\\" her. Along with crying, an eerie choir tune plays when she is near. The Witch has the strongest attack of the infected in the game; able to kill a survivor outright with one blow on the hardest difficulty. As such she is not playable by human players in Versus mode. In versus mode, four additional players can take control of the special infected‚Äîapart from the witch, who remains computer-controlled. Each infected player is randomly assigned a class of special infected when they enter a spawn mode. While in spawn mode, the infected can quickly roam around the map in search of an appropriate place in which to spawn. This location must be sufficiently distant from any survivor, out of the line of sight of any survivor, and outside restricted areas such as safe rooms. Upon death, the infected player must wait up to 10‚Äì25 seconds before re-entering spawn mode, depending on how many players are on the infected team. When a tank is spawned in the game, infected players receive a message indicating which player will control it. The human-controlled infected can see their teammates' outlines through walls similar to the survivors, but can also see each survivor's outline, which is colored according to the survivor's health and fades out if the survivor refrains from attacking, running and vocalizing. Vertical pathways exclusive to the infected, such as pipes and vines, are marked with animated symbols for the infected players. These can be climbed and used for ambushes. A cut special infected called the \\"Screamer\\" would be bound in a strait jacket and its presence made known by its maniacal cackling. If spotted, he would run away to find a safe hiding place; once it did, it would emit a loud scream to attract common infected. The directors soon found him to be stressful, especially if he was in a crowd, so they removed him from the game. At one point he coexisted with the Boomer; the Boomer would simply explode when killed and damage nearby player characters, and the Screamer would attract the common infected. The strait jacket suggests that the Screamer might have been insane (and subsequently bound by some sort of mental institution) prior to being infected. =AI Director= The artificial intelligence of Left 4 Dead features a dynamic system for game dramatics, pacing and difficulty called the \\"Director\\". Instead of fixed spawn points for enemies, the Director places enemies and items in varying positions and quantities based upon each player's current situation, status, skill and location, creating a new experience for each playthrough. The Director also creates mood and tension with emotional cues, such as visual effects, dynamic music, and character communication. Valve has termed this dynamic set-up \\"procedural narrative\\". In addition to the AI Director, there is a second Director that controls music. It was created as a way to keep the music interesting throughout the game. The music Director monitors what a player has experienced to create an appropriate mix. The process is client-side and done by a multi-track system. Each player hears their own mix, which is being generated as they play through the game, and dead players watching a teammate hear their teammates' mix. A far simpler version of the A.I. Director was previously used for some key battles in Half- Life 2: Episode Two. Valve is looking for ways to apply the Director in their future games to make pacing and difficulty more dynamic. =Game modes= Left 4 Dead contains four game modes: campaign, versus, survival, and single- player. The cooperative campaign consists of up to four human-controlled survivors who attempt to make their way between safe rooms and eventually to rescue. In this mode, the special infected are controlled by the AI. In a versus campaign, each team of one to four players plays each chapter of the campaign as both survivor and infected, swapping sides once per chapter. Unlike campaign mode, dead survivors do not respawn. If at least one player- controlled survivor finishes the level, the survivor team earns 100 points as well as bonus points based on their health and the health items in their inventory. These points are then multiplied by the chapter's difficulty level, and the number of survivors who finished. If all player-controlled survivors are killed, the survivor team only earns points according to their average progress through the chapter and the difficulty multiplier. Survival mode consists of a timed challenge where players try to survive as long as possible against a never-ending flood of the infected, added in April 2009 in the Survival Pack downloadable content. Single-player mode is similar to campaign mode, but played offline with three AI-controlled bots as the other survivors. On Xbox 360, other players can join in on the same console to turn single player into an offline co-op game. The game can also be played through a system link, or local area network. Players have also discovered a way to do splitscreen co-op play with the PC version. Development Development on Left 4 Dead started in mid-2005. Turtle Rock Studios aimed to create a horror film-inspired game that merges single player games' character-driven narrative structure with multiplayer games' social interaction and high replayability. The game was first revealed in the Christmas 2006 publication of PC Gamer UK with a six-page article describing a playthrough at Turtle Rock Studios headquarters. A teaser was released with The Orange Box. The game was first playable at the Showdown 2007 LAN in San Jose and at QuakeCon 2007. Turtle Rock Studios announced Left 4 Dead on November 20, 2006, and was acquired by Valve on January 10, 2008, because of the game and long-standing relationship between the companies. The game opened up to pre-purchasing on Valve's Steam system on October 15, 2008. To give Left 4 Dead significant exposure, Valve financed a $10-million marketing campaign for the game in the United States and Europe, with advertisements appearing on television, print, websites and outdoor placements in many cities. Valve also hosted photo contests called, \\"Dude, where's my thumb?\\" offering copies of Left 4 Dead to people who submitted the best picture involving zombies or the outdoor advertising. =Development= Left 4 Dead uses the 2008 version of Valve's Source engine, with improvements such as multi-core processor support and physics-based animation to more realistically portray hair and clothing, and to improve physics interaction with enemies when shot or shoved in different body parts. Animation was also improved to allow characters to lean realistically when moving in curved paths. Rendering and artificial intelligence were scaled up to allow for a greater number of enemies who can navigate the world in better ways, such as climbing, jumping, or breaking obstacles. Lighting was enhanced with new self-shadowing normal mapping and advanced shadow rendering that is important to convey information about the environment and player actions. Wet surfaces and fog are used to create mood. Many kinds of post processing cinematic visual effects inspired by horror movies have been added to the game. There is dynamic color correction that accentuates details based on importance, contrast and sharpening to focus attention on critical areas, film grain to expose details or imply details in dark areas and vignetting to evoke tension and a horror-film look. Left 4 Dead underwent many phases of development; influenced by playtesting, Turtle Rock Studios removed many of the features that were originally in the game. In the initial phases, there was another special infected, called the \\"screamer\\", which had no attacks but upon spotting a survivor would run to a safe place and then emit a loud scream that attracted a horde of infected. This infected class was removed, but its ability to attract the horde was incorporated into the boomer's vomit. A persistent merit/demerit system was envisioned to provide positive feedback for good behavior, such as aiding a fallen teammate; and negative feedback for poor behavior, such as shooting a teammate. This would provide a score to rank a player's effectiveness as a teammate, but this system was removed late in the development of the game in favor of immediate, non-persistent feedback displayed in-game. Another significant element removed was a long introduction between campaigns; because the game is designed for replayability, it was difficult to hold the player's attention for repeated viewings of cut scenes, so they were dropped in favor of a sparse narrative. Also, the game started out with one big city design with many routes for the survivors, but playtesters were confused when they began to play, and later they always chose the same route; ultimately Turtle Rock Studios cut the city maps into the first \\"No Mercy\\" and \\"Dead Air\\" campaigns. Certain Affinity assisted Turtle Rock Studios with the Xbox 360 version of the game. The Xbox 360 version of Left 4 Dead has the same game modes as the PC version but has additional features such as support for split screen, allowing for two players to play offline and online from the same console, and System Link play. Split-screen mode can also be achieved on the PC version, but it requires console commands and may require the modification of controller configuration files; and it is not officially supported. Both versions of the game have a new matchmaking system to simplify the process of finding other players. This new server management system was met with a negative reaction from PC server operators, who, with this system, had very little control over their servers. This led to Valve releasing a series of patches that allowed server operators to remove their server from the matchmaking \\"pool\\" of servers or make private servers. Valve runs dedicated servers for both versions of the game. (archives are members only to view. Log in with wikipedia@tempinbox.com and password xetafoki) =Promotion= To promote the game and provide basic training to players before starting the game, Valve chose to develop a pre-rendered intro movie. This movie was released on Halloween and shows events prior to the beginning of the \\"No Mercy\\" campaign. Valve chose an intro movie over in-game training mechanics because they wanted the players to be immediately dropped into a zombie apocalypse. Valve later detailed in their official Left 4 Dead blog how they designed the movie, from an intentionally very basic animation in the beginning of July 2008 to the final result for the launch of the game. Early access to the Left 4 Dead demo for people who pre-ordered the game began on November 6, 2008, for both Windows and Xbox 360. It gave users access to both online and single-player play in two \\"scenes\\" in one \\"movie\\" within the game. This promotion was being offered in addition to the ten percent savings for those who pre-order and applies to all Steam Windows pre-orders and all Windows and Xbox 360 pre-orders from GameStop and EB Games in North America. On November 11, the Left 4 Dead demo was made available to all Windows and Xbox 360 gamers worldwide. The Left 4 Dead demo was removed from the Xbox 360 Marketplace and Valve's own Steam after the game's release on November 18, 2008, however it is still available for those that played it. The demo had many server problems when it launched, primarily Valve's strategy for server management which made it impossible to set up a dedicated private server with administrator controls. However, a stream of patches led to the availability of a server browser and basic private server functionality as well as Valve's acknowledgment of player concerns. It appears that a patch released just before the game itself has resolved many of the connection issues that demo players were having. On May 1, 2009, the game was released freely via Steam as a one-day trial called \\"Freaky Free Friday\\". The trial was then extended to end on Saturday. On October 5, 2010, the price of the game via Steam was dropped to US$6.80, or a \\"4-pack\\" for $20.40, as a promotion coinciding with the release of \\"The Sacrifice\\" DLC. =Release= Left 4 Dead went gold on November 13, 2008, and was released on November 18, 2008, in North America; and on November 21, 2008, in Europe to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the release of Half-Life. Valve released a server patch in December 2008 to stop players on Xbox Live from using PC-style cheats. A spokesman from Valve said, \\"The fix is designed to halt the cheating behavior on the dedicated servers, which accounts for the majority of the co-op and versus modes of play.\\" =After release= Valve intended to support the PC version of the game through free content updates and the Xbox 360 version with DLC. On a podcast by Kotaku, writer Chet Faliszek divulged that an announcement regarding DLC for the PC and Xbox 360 would be released \\"very soon\\", and that the announcement was delayed by the holiday season. On February 5, 2009, Valve released details about the upcoming downloadable content pack. The two full campaigns of \\"Death Toll\\" and \\"Dead Air\\" for versus mode‚Äîwhich were previously unavailable‚Äîare included, as well as the survival game mode, where the survivors try to survive endless waves of the infected for as long as possible. On February 11, 2009, Valve announced that the downloadable content for the game would be free for both the Xbox 360 and PC; and on April 21, it was released. Survival mode shipped with 16 maps, 15 of them being modified portions of existing maps and one being a new lighthouse-themed level titled \\"The Last Stand\\". A Game Of the Year Edition of Left 4 Dead was released on the PC and Xbox 360 on May 12, 2009, with updates and new content included on the disc. On May 15, 2009, an open beta test for the Source Development Kit updated to support Left 4 Dead was started under the name of the \\"Left 4 Dead Authoring tools\\". This included a new set of plugins that allowed for users to import data from SketchUp, a free 3D modeling program, directly into the Hammer level editor for use in maps. The beta was concluded on June 25, 2009, with the full release of the Left 4 Dead authoring tools and corresponding server and matchmaking update to support custom maps. The update included a command line tool for packaging custom Left 4 Dead campaigns to ease distribution. A sequel, announced at the 2009 E3 conference and was released November 17, 2009. Addressing concerns voiced by fans, Gabe Newell responded to an email from Kotaku explaining that despite the upcoming sequel, Left 4 Dead would continue to be supported and more content is planned in the coming months. On August 4, 2009, Valve announced the second DLC pack. It contains a new campaign called Crash Course, set shortly after the events of the No Mercy campaign, where the Survivors try to get to a Truck Depot after the helicopter they were in crashed. It is available for co-op, versus and survival modes, with various tweaks to game mechanics, and containing new locations and character dialog. The DLC was announced to be released on September 29, 2009, on which date it was released for free for PC, but was accidentally released on Xbox Live at a higher price. The price was amended soon after, and all players who bought the DLC at the higher price were refunded. On November 9, 2009, a matchmaking update to allow for matchmaking between teams of four players in versus mode was released. An add-on campaign for Left 4 Dead 2, \\"The Passing\\", featured the Left 4 Dead survivors meeting the new cast as part of a full campaign. The Left 4 Dead 2 content was set for release in March 2010, however it was delayed until April 22, 2010. To connect the events in \\"The Passing\\" to that in Left 4 Dead, Valve released another add-on in October 2010 for both Left 4 Dead and its sequel, entitled \\"The Sacrifice\\"; the events of the add-on take place before \\"The Passing\\" and tells how the Left 4 Dead survivors come to encounter the group from Left 4 Dead 2, and how one sacrificed themselves for the safety of the others. Valve announced a 190-page digital comic that has been revealed in four parts in the weeks leading up to the release of The Sacrifice.PC Gamer: Valve reveal their new Left 4 Dead DLC PC Gamer.

The comic begins with Bill, having just sacrificed himself to save the others, taking on three tanks while severely wounded. It then cuts to the finale of Blood Harvest, which is revealed to be one week earlier. In The Sacrifice DLC, any player, whether playing as Bill or not, can choose to sacrifice themselves to allow the other survivors to complete the campaign. In March 2010, Valve announced that it would be bringing the Steam content platform to Mac OS X computers; along with it, they will be providing native versions of existing Valve games including Left 4 Dead and its sequel. The game was released for Mac OS X on October 27, 2010 Left 4 Dead support cross-platform play, allowing Mac players to play alongside PC players on the same servers, and is also part of the \\"Steam Play\\" cross-compatible and Steam Cloud titles, allowing a player that has purchased the game on one platform to download and play it on the other platform for free. Overkill Software, the developers of Payday: The Heist, a similar game to Left 4 Dead featuring four player co-operative gameplay, announced in June 2012 that it has worked with Valve to create a DLC level for Payday in the form of a map mirroring the \\"No Mercy\\" level from Left 4 Dead, however, this DLC level is not canon to Left 4 Dead and does not lead to the infection that initiated the events in Left 4 Dead. On August 20, 2015, an update for the game Zombie Army Trilogy was released, which imported the eight survivors from both Left 4 Dead games into ZAT. The original development studio behind Left 4 Dead, Turtle Rock Studios, announced a new IP in March, 2019 that is a spiritual successor to Left 4 Dead titled Back 4 Blood. Reception =Critical reception= Left 4 Dead received highly positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, the game received an aggregated score of 89 out of 100 for both Xbox 360 and PC. IGN stated, \\"It's almost pitch perfect in how it captures the tension and the action of a Hollywood zombie movie\\", and went on to describe it as, \\"quite possibly the perfect co-op shooter.\\" Giant Bomb commented that the Source engine was beginning to show its age, but praised the game's use of lighting and filmic effects that gives the game world, \\"a desolate, washed-out feeling\\", as well as the realistic and emotive faces and the engrossing art direction. Eurogamer concluded that Left 4 Dead \\"is another deeply professional, personality-filled and progressive take on the shooter from Valve.\\" Both IGN and GameSpot praised the game's replayability, but Gamespot criticized the \\"limited map selection\\" that could \\"sometimes feel a bit repetitious\\". GameSpy noted the lack of an overall narrative between the campaigns was disappointing. However, some reviewers praised its faithfulness to the zombie film genre, including the \\"deliberately ambiguous\\" back-story, and the amount of characterization and emotion brought by each of the four survivors. TeamXbox commented that clipping issues hurt the otherwise \\"incredibly good\\" visual experience. Hideo Kojima, creator of the Metal Gear series declared in an interview to 1UP.com that he was \\"addicted to the game\\", which was, in his view, one of the \\"core titles made with movie-industry people that explore the depths of hi-def\\". =Sales= On October 28, 2008, Valve reported that preorders for Left 4 Dead had beaten those of The Orange Box by 95 percent after the Steam pre-order was launched. On November 21, 2008, the day of the game's release in Europe, Valve issued a press release stating that Left 4 Dead had exceeded the pre-order numbers of The Orange Box by over 160 percent. The Xbox 360 version of Left 4 Dead was the seventh best-selling game of December 2008 in the United States, selling in excess of 629,000 copies. On February 3, Electronic Arts revealed that Left 4 Dead had sold 1.8 million copies, excluding Steam and worldwide sales figures. On March 26, Mike Booth revealed that the game had exceeded 2.5 million sales at retail during a presentation at the Game Developers Conference 2009. On September 24, 2009, Valve announced that almost 3 million copies of the game had been sold. On May 10, 2011, Doug Lombardi mentioned that the game and its sequel have each sold 3 million copies on the Xbox 360. On August 11, 2011, in a phone interview with Giant Bomb, Chet Faliszek said that the series has sold over 11 million units in total. =Awards= Left 4 Dead received recognition as one of the best multiplayer and PC games of 2008 from various organizations and gaming publications. The game was named the Best Multiplayer Game of 2008 by IGN, GameSpy, Spike TV, NoFrag and BAFTA; and as the \\"Computer Game of the Year\\" by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences (AIAS), Spike TV, and Bit-tech. Other awards include \\"Outstanding Achievement in Online Gameplay\\" from the AIAS, Best Use of Sound for the PC and Best Shooting game overall from IGN, Father of All FPS from Nofrag, and the best Cooperative Multiplayer and Shooter of 2008 from GameSpot who also nominated it for Game of the Year.

The complete mtDNA genome or just fragments of PCR-generated mtDNA can be transferred into the target mitochondria through the technique of protofection. Scientists have hypothesized for the last couple of decades that protofection can be beneficial for patients with mitochondrial diseases. This technique is a recent development and is continuously being improved.As mitochondrial DNA becomes progressively more damaged with age, this may provide a method of at least partially rejuvenating mitochondria in old tissue, restoring them to their original, youthful function.  Method  Protofection is a developing technique and is continuously being improved. A specific protein transduction system has been created that is complexed with mtDNA, which enables the mtDNA to move across the targeted cell's membrane and specifically target mitochondria. The transduction system used consists of a protein transduction domain(PTD), mitochondrial localization sequences(MLS), and mitochondrial transcription factor A(TFAM). Each of these play a specific role in protofection: * A PTD is needed because they are small regions of proteins that can cross the cell membrane of cells, independently. * A specific MLS is used for protofection because it permits mtDNA to enter the mitochondria. * TFAM is used because it unwinds the mtDNA that enters the mitochondria, which is critical for mtDNA replication. This process can lead to an increase in the amount of mtDNA present in the mitochondria of the target cells. The transduction system has been tweaked and modified, since the first use of protofection. To shorten the name of the complex, which was previously called PTD-MLS-TFAM complex, it is now named MTD-TFAM. MTD stands for mitochondrial transduction domain and it includes the PTD and the MLS.  Possible Therapeutic Uses  One hypothesis for mitochondrial diseases is that mitochondrial damage and dysfunction play an important role in aging. Protofection is being researched as a possibly viable laboratory technique for constructing gene therapies for inherited mitochondrial diseases, such as Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. Studies have shown that protofection can lead to improved mitochondrial function in targeted cells. Protofection could be applied to modified or artificial mitochondria. Mitochondria could be modified to produce few or no free radicals without compromising energy production. Recent studies have demonstrated that mitochondrial transplants may be useful to rejuvenate dead or dying tissue, such as in heart attacks, for which the mitochondria is the first part of the cell that dies.

Pur√≠sima means \\"purest\\" in Spanish and is most commonly used in Spanish to refer to La Pur√≠sima Concepci√≥n (the Immaculate Conception) of the Virgin Mary (note historical misspelling in English resulting in double \\"s\\", or the result of the Holstein pronunciation with use of the \\"·∫ù\\" being mistaken as √ü \\"ss\\", or perhaps spelling comes from the local Portuguese influence, where the spelling from A Pur√≠ssima Concei√ß√£o would be correct). Purissima is the name of the town used as the setting for Ross Macdonald's 1958 crime fiction novel 'The Doomsters'. History Map of the town in 1866 showing buildings, road and cemetery. Town of Purissima Residence and ranch of John Butt in 1877 Detail from 1894 parcel map with single 's' The town of Purisima was gone in 1940 but the school was still there Site of Purissima from Verde Road near Highway 1, May 2008 Located on Jos√© Mar√≠a Alviso's Rancho Ca√±ada de Verde y Arroyo de la Purisima in a rural area four miles (6 km) south of Half Moon Bay, the village was one of the earliest settlements on the San Mateo County coast. The first European mention of the area was noted by Juan Cresp√≠ on the Portol√° expedition of 1769. On October 27th they stopped at an abandoned Torose village at the northern side of the stream. The local guides told them they have moved into the mountains. Cresp√≠ christened the stream San Ivo (Saint Ives). This is now remembered as California Historical Landmark #22. The First American village, as well as the creek, was renamed Purisima in 1786. The town was founded in an agricultural area in the early 1850s. Henry Dobbel (born in the sovereign state of Holstein, then in a personal union with Denmark, on July 1, 1829; died in Purissima on December 22, 1891) came to California via Cape Horn in 1845. After working at odd jobs, and even running a San Francisco restaurant, Dobbel married German Margaret Roverkamf-Schroeder (born near Hanover, Kingdom of Hanover, in 1831; died in Purissima on September 3, 1885). She had come to California via the Isthmus of Panama. They bought a farm in the East Bay. In the 1860s, they sold their farm and bought from John Purcell. They built a big, ornate house on the south bank of Purisima Creek. The house had two stories and 17 rooms; it boasted such innovations as gas lighting and running water. Dobbel employed 50 men who planted and harvested wheat, barley, and potatoes. The community was badly flooded by Purisima Creek in January 1862, the same month that much of northern California experienced its worst floods in history. Some fields and buildings were swept away.National Weather Service records By the early 1870s, Purissima had a post office, several stores, a school, a one-story hotel known as Purissima House (owned by Richard Dougherty), and other buildings. The general store was built by Henry Husing. A lumber mill was constructed at the mouth of Purissima Canyon, to take advantage of the extensive redwood logging in the nearby Santa Cruz Mountains. Oil was discovered near the village in the 1880s on George Shout's land. However, hopes of an oil boom were dashed when only 20 barrels a day were produced. The U.S. Geological Survey has noted later efforts to drill for oil in the area, usually resulting in minor production. Henry Dobbel bought the general store, only to encounter financial difficulties when he extended credit to many of his customers. Then there were a series of crop failures, which eventually impacted Dobbel and the entire community. Henry Dobbel went bankrupt and sold his estate in 1890 to Henry Cowell. He remained in the area, however, and both he and his wife are buried in the village cemetery. The Ocean Shore Railroad, which operated from San Francisco to Tunitas Creek from 1907 to 1920, included a stop at Purissima, as noted on a U.S. Geological Survey's Santa Cruz quadrangle map. The Purissima Post Office opened in 1868, only to be discontinued in 1869. Then, in 1872, it reopened and continued to serve the community until 1901. Some buildings still remained as late as the 1930s, but the town was largely abandoned before World War II.Federal Writers Project California: A Guide to the Golden State, 1939. Revised 1954. The 1940 U.S. Geological Survey map shows a few buildings and notes the \\"Purisima School.\\"U.S. Geological Survey, Half Moon Bay quadrangle, 1940 edition The 1943 map still shows the school. At that time, State Route 1 still passed directly through Purissima. Today, Highway 1 runs farther west of the original route. Verde Road runs north from Lobitos to Purisima Creek Road; this is actually the original alignment of Highway 1.U.S. Geological Survey, Half Moon Bay quadrangle, 1961 edition According to the older maps, the school was located on the north side of what is now Verde Road, just east of Highway 1. The cemetery is in the woods bordered by Verde Road and Highway 1. In 1939, the Federal Writers Project guidebook for California noted, \\"The village of Purisima, once a lively town on Jose Maria Alivso's Rancho Canada y Arroyo de la Purisima, is ghostly and deserted now. Its weathered gray buildings stand among mosshung cypresses and eucalytpus trees, their windows broken, their stairs falling in, their facades rudely stuck with gay circus posters.\\" No clear reasons have been found for the demise of the community; presumably its remote location led some residents to move to Half Moon Bay or other communities. All that remains of Purissima today is the cemetery (still noted on U.S. Geological Survey maps) and a part of the school. Several farms surround the site. There are numerous evergreen trees and heavy vegetation at the site. Dayna Chalif, who has explored the Purissima Cemetery and researched historic archives, wrote, \\"Purissima was supposed to be the big town on the coast, [but it] was harder to get to.\\" The failure of the Ocean Shore Railroad, which was intended to provide better access to the San Mateo County coast, may have hurt Purissima, although the village was later included on the original routing of Highway 1. Until the 1950s, however, much of the San Mateo County coastal area remained sparsely settled and the few surviving communities were relatively small. With the dramatic rise of housing costs along San Francisco Bay (with average prices over $1 million in 2008), there has been greater incentive to build along the Pacific Ocean, resulting in the steady growth of Montara, Moss Beach, El Granada, Half Moon Bay, and Pescadero. This has done little for Purissima, which had long since vanished. Local newspaper articles have frequently mentioned that limited access to the area, primarily via Highways 1 and 92, has been a major factor in the slow growth. With the completion of the Devil's Slide tunnel on Highway 1 in 2012, access to the coastal communities south of San Francisco has improved. In 2017, some restoration was begun of the site, with emphasis on cleaning up the cemetery, including access trails. Very little remains of the village besides the cemetery. Purisima Creek There is also the same named Purisima Creek, which passes near the town site. Purisima Creek Road follows the creek for some distance, toward the Santa Cruz Mountains to the east. There are some seasonal, sometimes spectacular falls along the creek. The creek was subsequently named Arroyo de la Purissima by later Spanish explorers. Cemetery Old family plots of the ghost town On September 15, 1868, John Purcell deeded some of his property to the citizens of Purissima for a burial ground. The Purissima Cemetery Association was created. Free burials were to be provided to Purissima residents. A Protestant church was to be built next to the cemetery. Today, many of the gravestones in this cemetery are missing or broken. In the summer of 2005, Dayna Chalif transcribed the existing gravestones in the Purissima Cemetery, which was long largely overgrown with weeds, vines, and poison oak, making it very difficult to access. Recently (2017) a local company has cleared a path and advertises natural burial services on the site.

It was designed by ATI (now AMD), and is manufactured using the same 90 nm CMOS process as Broadway, the Wii's central processing unit. Very few official details about Hollywood were released to the public by Nintendo, ATI, or any other company involved in the Wii's development. The Hollywood GPU is reportedly based on the GameCube's Flipper GPU and is clocked 50% higher at 243 MHz, though these clock rates have never been officially confirmed. Hollywood is a multi-chip module (MCM) package containing two dies under the cover. The first of these two chips, codenamed Napa, controls the I/O functions, RAM access, the Audio DSP, and the actual GPU with its embedded DRAM, and measures 8 √ó 9 mm. The other, codenamed Vegas, holds 24 MB of \\"internal\\" 1T-SRAM and measures 13.5 √ó 7 mm.

The Wii inherited the TEV from Flipper, and the TEV is - to use an analogy from Factor 5 director Julian Eggebrecht - \\"like an elaborate switchboard that makes the wildest combinations of textures and materials possible.\\" The TEV pipeline combines up to 8 textures in up to 16 stages at once. Each stage can apply a multitude of functions to the texture. This was frequently used to simulate pixel shader effects such as bump-mapping, or to perform effects such as cel shading. On the GameCube, Factor 5's Star Wars: Rogue Squadron II used the TEV for the targeting computer effect and the simulated volumetric fog. In another scenario, Wave Race: Blue Storm used the TEV notably for water distortion (such as refraction) and other water effects. The Wii's TEV unit and TEV capabilities are no different from the GameCube's, excluding indirect performance advantages from the faster clock speeds.  Starlet  Hollywood contains an ARM926EJ-S core, which has been unofficially nicknamed Starlet. This embedded microprocessor runs an undocumented operating system called IOS and performs many of the Wii's I/O functions, including controlling the wireless functionality, USB, the SD card interface, the optical disc drive, the internal NAND flash storage, WiiConnect24 when the console is in standby mode, and other miscellaneous functions. The Starlet acts as the security controller of the console, performing various cryptography functions; Starlet is designed to remain secure even if the Broadway is compromised. Hollywood includes hardware implementations of AES and SHA-1 to speed up Starlet's security functionality. Communication between the Starlet and the Broadway is accomplished via an IPC mechanism. Starlet has complete control over Broadway; the former can reboot the latter and supply it with code to execute at any time.

The Divine Word University of Tacloban was founded in 1929 and was closed in June 1995 by the school administrators after a court ruling favoring the labor union which represents its faculty members and other employees. In 2006, DWU reopened its doors with a new administration and a new name, Liceo del Verbo Divino. History =Collective bargaining= Two prolonged strikes occurred in 1988 and in 1989. From the start the administrators were unwilling to negotiate with the union. Instead of accepting the union's right to represent the workers on the basis of signed memberships, they demanded a certification election. Union leaders were antagonized with this approach. In addition, the administration's lawyers advised them to attempt to form a parallel union of their own which would be more favorable to the administration, but the court considered this to be \\"union busting\\". Aerial view of Liceo del Verbo Divino, Tacloban City, Philippines In 1990 the Supreme Court of the Philippines ruled in favor of the labor union: \\"In Divine Word University of Tacloban vs. Secretary of Labor and Employment, petitioner therein, Divine Word University of Tacloban, refused to perform its duty to bargain collectively. Thus, we upheld the unilateral imposition on the university of the CBA proposed by the Divine Word University Employees Union. We said further: 'That being the said case, the petitioner may not validly assert that its consent should be a primordial consideration in the bargaining process. By its acts, no less than its action which bespeak its insincerity, it has forfeited whatever rights it could have asserted as an employer.' \\"213 SCRA 759, 11 September 1992, Ruling of Supreme Court of the Philippines, cited in General Milling Corporation vs. Hon.

Bodies are deeply compressed and the mouth is quite small. They have 13 dorsal spines, 20-21 dorsal soft rays, 3 anal spines and 20 anal soft rays. Adults of the blue ring angelfish exhibit a dark orange to brown or violet coloring with a blue ring near their head (hence the common name) and blue horizontal semicircular marks on the middle of the body. Two blue stripes cross the face. The caudal fin is white. Juveniles of the blue ring angelfishes are at first a dark blue, almost black, with broad turquoise and white vertical stripes. These fishes show a considerable resemblance to the Emperor Angelfish in that it undergoes changes in coloring in its development from youth to maturity. Biology and behavior Blue ring angelfishes are frequently encountered in pairs. Similarly to other species of the genus Pomacanthus these angelfishes live in harem, as the male defends a territory and controls a few females. After a courtship ritual males and females release eggs and sperm. At the beginning of life all juveniles are females (protogynous hermaphrodites), becoming males during the development, with a complete color variation from the juvenile to adult stage. Juveniles prefer very shallow waters with rock or dead coral substrates and short filamentous algae. Adults mainly feed on zooplankton, sponges, filamentous algae and tunicates. WoRMS ‚Äì World Register of Marine Species In the aquarium Blue ring angelfish is a highly sought after and prized angelfish. Often it can reach a length near 12 inches in captivity. In the aquarium they are algae grazers but consume fish and coral flesh as well. They are known to eat shrimps and nibble on both large polyped stony and small polyped stony corals. Overall most seasoned reef aquarists do not recommend keeping this species in a reef aquarium due to these habits. Gallery File: Pomacanthus annularis juvenil.jpgPomacanthus annularis.

The Ofoten Line and the Iron Ore Line are two railroad lines which were built to allow iron ore to be hauled from the LKAB's mines in Kiruna, Svappavaara and Malmberget in Sweden to Lule√• on the Baltic Sea in Sweden and to Narvik on the Norwegian Sea in Norway. Historically, these lines were operated by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) in Norway and the Swedish State Railways (SJ) in Sweden, but in 1996 the operations, but not the infrastructure, were transferred to the new company Malmtrafik i Kiruna (MTAB), a joint venture between LKAB, NSB and SJ, and its Norwegian subsidiary Malmtrafikk (MTAS). At the time, the line was using El 15 and Dm3 locomotives. In 1998, LKAB estimated a steady 35% increase in iron ore production until 2005, and requested that the governments grant sufficient funding to upgrade the lines from to maximum permitted axle load. Combined with new locomotives, this would give increased efficiency in hauling the ore from the mines. The upgrade was estimated to cost 180 million Norwegian krone (NOK) for the Ofoten Line alone. An Iore hauling an empty ore train near Tornetr√§sk. In March 1998, LKAB awarded the contract to build 750 new 100-tonne hopper cars to Transnet of South Africa. In August, an agreement was reached whereby LKAB would pay NOK 100 million of the NOK 130 million needed to upgrade the Ofoten Line. The contract to deliver 18 locomotives was signed with Adtranz Switzerland on 15 September 1998. In 1999, LKAB bought SJ's and NSB's share in MTAB. The first two sections were delivered by Adtranz in August 2000, and was subjected to intensive tests before the manufacture of the rest of the series. Commissioning concluded in December 2000, the locomotive started regular service on 10 January 2001, and started operation with the new hopper cars and axle load on 7 March 2001. In May 2001, Bombardier Transportation took over Adtranz. Bombardier delivered the rest of the Iore series from 2002 to 2005. In March 2004, LKAB decided not to purchase additional hopper cars from Transnet, and instead purchased 750 heavier cars from K-Industrier. Since 1969, the ore trains have been using the Soviet SA3 coupler. However, LKAB wanted to also try Janney couplers (also known as AAR coupler, used in much heavier trains in USA and South Africa), as the SA3 couplers were not much tested with the new weights. While the first pair of locomotives had Janney couplers, the rest of the locomotives were equipped with SA3 couplers to handle the existing hopper cars, and the cars bought from K-Industrier. The locomotives and Transnet wagons with Janney couplers were retrofitted with SA3 couplers. In 2004, the El 15 locomotives were sold to Hector Rail. On 23 August 2007, LKAB ordered another four twin units, with delivery in 2010 and 2011, and costing ‚Ç¨52 million. These will replace all remaining Dm3 locomotives by 2011, and LKAB convert all the ore trains to 68 cars. This will increase the capacity from 28 to 33 million tonnes per year, and at the same time reduce the number of departures per day from 21 to 15. The name Iore is a mixture between the term Iron ore, and the fictional character Eeyore from Winnie-the-Pooh, spelled I-or in Swedish. Specifications An Iore locomotive The Iore class was a cold-adapted and heavy-haul derivation from Adtranz's Octeon modular electric locomotive platform, which was launched in 1998 on the basis of Adtranz's latest models for Deutsche Bahn at the time. Adtranz and later Bombardier Transportation conducted the final assembly of the locomotives at Kassel, Germany. When Bombardier Transportation introduced the brand name TRAXX for its updated modular locomotive platform, the type designation TRAXX H80 AC was applicable to the Iore class, however, it was excluded from the TRAXX family by the time of the second batch order in 2007. The manufacturer has also referred to the locomotive type as the Bombardier Kiruna. Each Iore consists of twin units with one driver's cab at each. They normally operate in fixed units of two, making a pair capable of hauling a ore train. Technically an Iore section is also capable to operate as single locomotive, an option that is seldom used in operation. The units are fed with via a pantograph. The power is transformed and then converted via a single water-cooled gate turn-off (GTO) thyristor based converter per bogie. The converters belong to the Camilla family, which was developed by ABB's Swiss branch as successor for its oil-cooled converters, and found previous use in the FS Class E464. The converters operate independently, with their own cooling and control systems and are shut down automatically in case of failure. The converters consist of seven line-replaceable unit modules to minimize maintenance costs. Each locomotive has six three-phase asynchronous alternating current traction motors, each rated at and each powering a single axle.http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot326.nsf/veritydisplay/b53e94802c75e541c125789a00290729/$file/Railvolution02-11-Traction- transformer-Kiruna.pdf This gives a Co‚Ä≤Co‚Ä≤ wheel arrangement. The tractive effort of each locomotive is and the maximum dynamic braking effort is . There is also a boost function, allowing a temporary traction effort of . The units are capable of in single runs, with empty trains and with loaded trains. The locomotives are long, tall and wide. The distance between the bogie centers is and the bogie wheel-base is . The wheel diameter is when new and when worn. Each locomotive weighs , of which is electrical equipment. Each locomotive has of dead weight to increase the locomotive's weight to the maximum axle weight, and further weight increase has been achieved by making the walls wide with armored steel. The extra wall thickness also provides for increased structural strength, to withstand collisions with snowdrifts and elk. The sides of the walls were built as flat as possible to reduce the sticking of blowing snow and ice formation. The auxiliary system is powered via a separate transformer winding feeding three independent insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) converters each providing a three-phase 400 volt system. The locomotive is designed with an open system architecture that can be adapted later. Diagnostic information is available to the driver and can be sent to the control center via GSM-R. The locomotive has a large and bright cab with space for up to three people. The second series of locomotives have an improved driver's chair, which has been retrofitted on the older trains. The machine room has a center hallway. All high-current equipment is located behind a door which can only be opened with a special key. This key is locked in such a way that it cannot be accessed without grounding the locomotive, and similarly the locomotive cannot be ungrounded again until the key is back in place. Operation Map showing the Iron Ore and Ofoten Lines LKAB operates iron ore mines in Kiruna, Svappavaara and Malmberget in Norrbotten County, Sweden. Most of the output is transported by rail to the ice-free Port of Narvik, a route named the Northern Circuit. A minority of the ore is transported to Lule√• on the Southern Circuit. Located on the Baltic Sea, ore is shipped to Baltic customers, or delivered to furnaces operated by SSAB in Lule√• and Oxel√∂sund. The Iron Ore and Ofoten Lines are long, including the branch to Svappavaara, with the route from Kiruna to Narvik being , and from Malmberget to Lule√• being . Operations are handled by LKAB's subsidiary Malmtrafik i Kiruna (MTAB) in Sweden, and Malmtrafikk (MTAS) in Norway. As of 2010, six pairs of the first batch Iore locomotives operate 11 to 13 trains daily in each direction on the Northern Circuit, and the remaining three pairs of the first batch operate five to six trains on the Southern Circuit. The four pairs of second- batch locomotives will replace Dm3 locomotives on the Northern Circuit by 2011. The trains hauled by Iore are 68 cars long and weigh . From Riksgr√§nsen on the national border to the Port of Narvik, the trains use only a fifth of the power they regenerate. The regenerated energy is sufficient to power the empty trains back up to the national border. Although the trains and hopper cars are all owned by LKAB, the line is owned by the Swedish Transport Administration and Bane NOR. The Iron Ore and Ofoten Lines are also used by passenger and container trains.
