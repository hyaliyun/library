Family Parahotep was the son of the High Priest of Ptah Pahemnetjer and his wife Huneroy. Parahotep had an older brother named Didia who also served as a High Priest of Ptah. A seated statue, now in the British Museum (BM712), depicts the vizier (Pa)Rahotep and on the seat his son Mery, Deputy of the House of Life, his wife Huneroy, who is a chief of the harem of Herishef and his mother-in-law Buia named Khat'nesu are mentioned. Prehotep's wife Huneroy was the daughter of the High Priest of Anhur, named Minmose. Life Prehotep's father Pahemnetjer became High Priest of Ptah about year 20 of Ramesses II (ca. 1259 BC). Prehotep may have still been young at that time. It seems that by about year 35 (ca. 1244 BC) ‚Äì after being in office for 15 years ‚Äì Pahemnetjer died or at least stepped down as high priest. That position went to Prehotep's elder brother Didia. In year 45 (ca. 1233 BC) Didia is no longer High Priest of Ptah, but the priestly appointment does not go to Prehotep. It is Khaemwaset, the son of Ramesses II who takes on that role in Memphis, Egypt. About 5 years later (ca. 1228 BC) Prehotep is appointed as Northern Vizier. At the same time Neferronpet is Vizier of the South and between the two of them these men head the civil administration of Egypt. In year 55 (ca. 1223 BC), Khaemwaset dies and following in the footsteps of his father and older brother Prehotep becomes High Priest of Ptah in Memphis, Egypt. Prehotep also takes on the position of High Priest of Ra in Heliopolis. That position he seems to have taken over after the death of prince Meryatum, the son of Ramesses II and Nefertari, who had been in office for almost 20 years. Prehotep held the positions of vizier and high priest of Ptah and Ra until the end of the reign of Ramesses II, thereby serving as vizier for at least 17 years and as high priest for at least 12 years. Identity with Prehotep I There is not yet any full agreement in Egyptology whether there were two or just one viziers with the name Prehotep. Indeed, some scholars regard Prehotep I and Prehotep II as one person, others as two. When Flinders Petrie excavated the tomb of Prehotep at Sedment, he found two sarcophagi in the burial chamber and distinguished between Prehotep and Rehotep. However, the second, not well preserved sarcophagus belonged to the wife of the vizier named Huneroy (Hel). Wolfgang Helck saw two viziers with these slightly different names. However, Cerny in a review of Helck's book draw attention to a scribe at Deir -el-Medina with the same name who appears sometimes as Prehotep, sometimes as Rehotep and concluded that there is only one vizier with the name Prehotep and the variation of the name Rehotep.J. Cerny: in Bibliothec Orientalis 19 (1962), p. 142 De Meulenaere saw the main reason for dividing the sources onto two people in the canopic jars of Prehotep. Indeed, there are five canopic jars with his name and titles, while Egyptians in general had only four of them. It was argued that the fifth jar comes from a cenotaph of the vizier. Supporter for one vizier with that name also argue that there is only one tomb of a vizier Prehotep known and that the sources (so far about 45 objects) better fit to just one person.most recent fuller discussion: Christine Raedler: Die Wesire Ramses'II.-Netzwerke der Macht, in Das √§gyptische K√∂nigtum im Spannungsfeld zwischen Innen- und Au√üenpolitik im 2.

History and text  The cantata of Bach's third annual cycle in Leipzig was written for the Tenth Sunday after Trinity. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the First Epistle to the Corinthians, different gifts, but one spirit (), and from the Gospel of Luke, Jesus announcing the destruction of Jerusalem and cleansing of the Temple (). The words of the cantata are only generally connected to the readings, asking the soul to return immediately to God's ways. Two movements are based on Bible words, the opening chorus on , movement 4 on . The cantata is closed by verses 6 and 7 of the hymn \\"\\" by Johann Heermann (1630), sung on the melody of Martin Luther's \\"\\" based on the Lord's Prayer. The words of the free poetry have been attributed to different authors: C. S. Terry suggests Christian Weiss Sr, Werner Neumann suggests Christiana Mariana von Ziegler, and Walther Blankenburg suggests Christoph Helm. Bach first performed the cantata on 25 August 1726 and again around 1737.  Scoring and structure  The cantata is scored for alto, tenor and bass soloists and a four-part choir (SATB), flauto traverso, two oboes, two violins, viola, and basso continuo. The seven movements are structured in two parts, part two to be performed after the sermon. # Chorus: # Recitative (bass): # Aria (alto): # Arioso (bass): ::Parte seconda # * Aria (tenor): # Recitative (alto): # Chorale:  Music  The opening chorus is a mature work containing an intricate combination of instrumental and vocal parts and a variety of expressive devices depicting the words. The opening sinfonia is in two parts which are repeated separately and together throughout the movement. The words are repeated three times. Bach used the music for the of his Missa in G minor. Movements 3 and 5 are used in the Missa in F major. The bass voice in movement 4, marked arioso by Bach himself, is treated similarly to the , the voice of Jesus in Bach's Passions and cantatas. The bass part has been recorded by singers who do not specialise in Baroque music, such as Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau with conductor Benjamin Britten at the Aldeburgh Festival.

Route description View north along MD 755 in Edgewood MD 755 begins at an entrance to the Edgewood Area of Aberdeen Proving Ground; the highway continues south into the military installation as Wise Road. This gate is open from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm weekdays and allows entry for persons with a Government ID; visitors to the Edgewood Area of Aberdeen Proving Ground must use the gate along MD 24. The state highway heads north as a two-lane undivided road that passes under Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and passes by two entrances to the Edgewood station, which is a stop on MARC's Penn Line. After leaving the village of Edgewood and passing Trimble Road, MD 755 expands to a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane. The state highway continues north through residential subdivisions until an acute intersection with MD 24 (Emmorton Road). Beyond that intersection, MD 755 expands to a four-lane undivided highway and enters a commercial area before reaching its northern terminus at US 40 (Pulaski Highway). Edgewood Road continues north as a two-lane county highway that crosses Winters Run, has a one-lane underpass of CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision, and intersects MD 7 before veering northeast to another intersection with MD 24 just south of Interstate 95 (I-95). MD 755 is a part of the National Highway System as an intermodal connector between the Edgewood MARC station and MD 24. History Edgewood Road was built as a concrete road from US 40 (now MD 7) in the community of Van Bibber south to its entrance to Aberdeen Proving Ground at its Pennsylvania Railroad crossing (now Amtrak) in 1930. The state highway, which was originally designated MD 408, was constructed with a width of but was proposed for widening to as early as 1934 since it was the main entrance to the Edgewood Arsenal. MD 408 received an underpass of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (now CSX) and approaches to the grade separation in 1939. MD 24 assumed all of MD 408 when MD 24 was extended south from MD 7 to Aberdeen Proving Ground in 1952. A new section of Edgewood Road was constructed from MD 7 north to just south of the future I-95 interchange in 1956 to remove MD 24's staggered intersections at MD 7 in Van Bibber. The next relocation of MD 24 in the Edgewood area occurred in two sections starting in 1967. MD 24 was moved to its present alignment from just south of the I-95 interchange to Edgewood Road south of US 40 in 1970. The bypass included a bridge over US 40; access between the two highways was provided by Edgewood Road, which was designated MD 755. The new alignment of MD 24 was extended south to a new entrance to Aberdeen Proving Ground in 1974; MD 755 was extended south along MD 24's old alignment to the pre-existing entrance next to the Edgewood train station. MD 755 achieved its present length around 1991 when the portion of Edgewood Road north of US 40 was transferred to county maintenance.

March 2003. p. 5A-4. Retrieved 2010-07-17 was a tract of land in Ohio ceded by Indians to the United States of America in the Treaty of Greenville in 1795. This particular area of land immediately surrounding Fort Miami was considered to be of strategic importance by the United States government representatives. It was subsequently surveyed in a manner different from surrounding land, and lots sold, or granted, to settlers. History In 1680, Frontenac, the French Governor of Canada, established Fort Miami on the west bank of the Maumee River. It was the first fortification in Ohio built by non-indigenous people. The fort was used as a trading post for a short time, then abandoned. During the Northwest Indian War the British rebuilt Fort Miami to assist the Indians fighting the Americans. The Americans won the Battle of Fallen Timbers nearby in 1794. As a result of the battle, the Treaty of Greenville was signed, which ceded much of southern and eastern Ohio to the United States. In addition, Article 3 ceded a number of other tracts, including #8: \\"One piece twelve miles square, at the British fort on the Miami of the Lake, at the foot of the rapids.\\" \\\\- Text of Treaty of Greenville Library of Congress At that time, the Maumee river was called the Miami of the lake, and the foot of the rapids are today between the towns Maumee and Perrysburg. In 1795, Jay's Treaty led to the fort being abandoned in 1796. Survey and settlement 350px While the French and British occupied the region, many white people settled near the fort. The United States wished to give legal title to these people, and sell the rest of the tract. To accomplish this, on March 3, 1805, \\\\- Text of Act of March 3, 1805 Library of Congress Congress arranged for a special indiscriminate location survey for the reserve. Deputy surveyor Elias Glover subdivided the tract into four townships of six miles (10 km) square each in 1805, with the southwest township being number one, the northwest number two, the northeast number three, and the southeast number four. The tract has no ranges, and is an original survey, unrelated to later 1821 Congress Lands surveys that surround the reserve, known as North and East of First Principal Meridian. In 1807, Congress directed that every person in the actual possession of any tract of land, in his own right, and settled, occupied and improved by him prior to the first day of July, 1796, or by some other person under whom he claimed the right to its occupancy or possession, should be confirmed in his title as an estate of inheritance in fee simple, and be entitled to a land patent for it. Each township was subdivided into 36 sections numbered boustrophedonically, as established by the Act of May 18, 1796. \\\\- Text of Act of May 18, 1796 Library of Congress Under the Act of 1816, Joseph Wampler surveyed the riverfront into long lots of about each, numbered 1 to 93, and officially called \\"River Tracts\\". \\\\- Text of Act of April 27, 1816 Library of Congress The private claims of the British and French era settlers were surveyed in 1817 by deputy surveyor S. Carpenter. The partial sections left after the River Tracts were called \\"Fractional Sections\\". The Act of 1816 set aside section 16 of each township as School Lands for benefit of schools in each township. These sections were eventually sold. Town lots in Perrysburg were also laid out in 1816, providing less than two sections of land in lots less than each. Land sales were through the Wooster Land Office in the Canton Land District.

It was founded by editor-in-chief and publisher Rena Tran and began publication in February 2008 under the title Erie Life Magazine, but went out of production in 2011. The magazine was available in over 750 retail locations in Pennsylvania, Ohio, western New York, eastern Michigan, and southern Ontario and circulated to over 25,000 readers.  Erie Life Magazine  Erie Life Magazine's first issue was published in February 2008 and featured a cover story on Erie Philharmonic conductor Daniel Meyer. While located in the Renaissance Centre in downtown Erie, Erie Life Magazine was the only magazine in the Erie area not affiliated with either local broadcasters or the Erie Times-News.  Great Lakes Life Magazine  In its first two years, Erie Life Magazine saw an unprecedented growth, increasing distribution from only 25 small, independent retail locations to over 640 big box retail points in four states and southern Ontario including Barnes & Noble, Borders, Wegmans Food Markets, Walmart, Walgreens, Country Fair, Giant Eagle Grocery Stores, Chapters, and Indigo Books and Music. Today, Great Lakes Life's readership is close to 100,000 readers. Due to the expanded readership, the publication was rebranded Great Lakes Life Magazine, starting with the April 2010 issue. The new title reflects the magazine's expanded coverage as it no longer focuses solely on Erie, but also areas surrounding Buffalo, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Ontario. The rebranding also included moving the publication out of Erie, Pennsylvania, to its new home in Westfield, New York, to distance itself from being directly associated with any of the cities it covers. Awards and recognition In 2010 Great Lakes Life Magazine won two first place awards at the Ohio Excellence in Journalism Awards. Sponsored by the Press Club of Cleveland, the awards recognize Ohio's top performers in various realms of journalism. Great Lakes Life won \\"General Photo: Multiple Images\\" for the \\"Women Who Beat the Odds\\" spread from the October 2009 issue and \\"Best Departments or Columns\\" for the recurring Aging Smart section that runs in each issue. The awards were given out on June 18, 2010. Great Lakes Life Magazine has also been the subject of several articles from magazine industry giant Folio.

It was the first of a planned two-ship class that would respond to earlier warship purchases by other South American countries. Construction began at Elswick, Newcastle upon Tyne soon after the ship was ordered in November 1911, and was approaching completion when it was bought by the United Kingdom's Royal Navy for use in the First World War. Commissioned in September 1915, it served in the Grand Fleet as HMS Canada for the duration of the war and saw action during the Battle of Jutland. Chile repurchased Canada in 1920 and renamed it Almirante Latorre. The ship was designated as Chile's flagship, and frequently served as a presidential transport. It underwent a thorough modernization in the United Kingdom in 1929‚Äì1931. In September 1931, crewmen aboard Almirante Latorre instigated a mutiny, which the majority of the Chilean fleet quickly joined. After divisions developed between the mutineers, the rebellion fell apart and the ships returned to government control. Almirante Latorre was placed in reserve for a time in the 1930s because of the Great Depression, but it was in good enough condition to receive interest from the United States after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Chilean government declined the overture and the ship spent most of the Second World War on patrol for Chile. Almirante Latorre was scrapped in Japan beginning in 1959.  Background  Almirante Latorres genesis can be traced to the numerous naval arms races between Chile and Argentina, which in turn were spawned by territorial disputes over their mutual borders in Patagonia and Puna de Atacama, along with control of the Beagle Channel. Naval races flared up in the 1890s and in 1902; the latter was eventually settled via British mediation. Provisions in the dispute-ending treaty imposed restrictions on both countries' navies. The United Kingdom's Royal Navy bought the two Constituci√≥n-class pre-dreadnought battleships that were being built for Chile, and Argentina sold its two Rivadavia-class armored cruisers under construction in Italy to Japan.Scheina, Naval History, 45‚Äì52.Garrett, \\"Beagle Channel Dispute\\", 86‚Äì88. After was commissioned, Brazil decided in early 1907 to halt construction of three obsolescent pre- dreadnoughts in favor of two or three dreadnoughts.Whitley, Battleships of World War Two, 24. These ships, commissioned as the , were designed to carry the heaviest battleship armament in the world at the time.\\"Germany may buy English warships\\", The New York Times, 1 August 1908, C8. They came as a shock to the navies of South America. Historian Robert Scheina commented that they \\"outclassed the entire [elderly] Argentinian fleet\\".Scheina, \\"Argentina\\", 400. Although debates raged in Argentina over whether it would be prudent to counter Brazil's purchase by acquiring their own expensive dreadnoughts, further border disputes‚Äîparticularly near the River Plate with Brazil‚Äîdecided the matter, and it ordered two s (no relation to the earlier cruisers) from the Fore River Shipbuilding Company in the United States.Scheina, \\"Argentina\\", 401.Livermore, \\"Battleship Diplomacy\\", 33. With its major rival acquiring dreadnoughts, Chile responded by asking for tenders from American and European countries that would give the country the most powerful battleships afloat.Scheina, Naval History, 84.  Construction  Almirante Latorres launch, November 1913. On 6 July 1910, the National Congress of Chile passed a bill allocating 400,000 pounds sterling annually to the navy for the construction of two battleships‚Äîwhich would eventually be named Almirante Latorre and Almirante Cochrane‚Äîsix destroyers, and two submarines.\\"Acorazado Almirante Latorre\\", Armada de Chile, archived 8 June 2008. The contract to build the battleships was awarded to Armstrong Whitworth on 25 July 1911.Livermore, \\"Battleship Diplomacy\\", 42. Almirante Latorre was officially ordered on 2 November 1911, and was laid down less than a month later on 27 November,Scheina, Naval History, 322.Scheina, \\"Chile\\", 408. becoming the largest ship built by Armstrong at the time.Gill, \\"Professional Notes\\", 493. The New York Tribune reported on 2 November 1913 that Greece had reached an accord to purchase Almirante Latorre during a war scare with the Ottoman Empire,\\"Turkey Threatened with Another War\\", New York Tribune, 2 November 1913, 12. but despite a developing sentiment within Chile to sell one or both of the dreadnoughts, no deal was made.Livermore, \\"Battleship Diplomacy\\", 45.Kaldis, \\"Background for Conflict\\", D1135. Almirante Latorre was launched on 27 November 1913,Gill, \\"Professional Notes\\", 193. in an elaborate ceremony that was attended by various dignitaries and presided over by Chile's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Agust√≠n Edwards Mac Clure. The battleship was christened by the ambassador's wife, Olga Budge de Edwards.  British purchase and First World War service  Plans of HMS Canada After the First World War broke out in Europe, Almirante Latorre was formally purchased by the United Kingdom on 9 September 1914;Preston, \\"Great Britain\\", p38.\\"British Navy Gains\\", The New York Times, 7 December 1918, 14. it was not forcibly seized like other ships being built in British yards for foreign navies (such as the battleships Re≈üadiye and Sult√¢n Osm√¢n-ƒ± Evvel for the Ottoman Empire) because the Allies' reliance on Chilean Sodium nitrate for munitions made retention of Chile's \\"friendly neutral\\" status with the United Kingdom a matter of vital importance. Almirante Latorre was renamed HMS Canada and slightly modified for British service. The bridge was taken off in favor of two open platforms, and a mast was added in between the two funnels to support a derrick that would service launches.Burt, British Battleships, p 240. The super-dreadnought completed fitting-out on 20 September 1915, and was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 15 October. She initially served with the 4th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet. Canada saw action in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May‚Äì1 June 1916 under Captain William Nicholson. She fired 42 rounds from its 14-inch guns and 109 6-inch shells during the battle, and suffered no hits or casualties. During the battle, it got off two salvoes at the disabled cruiser at 18:40, and fired five more at an unknown ship around 19:20.Campbell, Jutland, p157, 206‚Äì07. It fired its 6-inch guns at German destroyers at 19:11.Campbell, Jutland, p210. Canada was transferred to the 1st Battle Squadron on 12 June 1916. In 1917‚Äì18, it was fitted with better rangefinders and range dials, and two of the aft 6-inch secondary guns were removed after they suffered blast damage from the middle 14-inch turret. In the latter year, flying-off platforms for aircraft were added atop the superfiring turrets fore and aft. Canada was put into the reserve fleet in March 1919.  Chilean service  = Early career = After the end of the war in Europe, Chile began to seek additional ships to bolster its fleet. The United Kingdom offered many of its surplus warships, including the two remaining s. The news that Chile could possibly acquire two Invincibles kindled a major uproar in the country, with naval officers publicly denouncing such an action and instead promoting the virtues of submarines and aircraft on the basis of lower costs and their performance in the First World War.Somervell, \\"Naval Affairs\\", 389‚Äì90. The nations of South America worried that an attempt to regain the title of \\"the first naval power in South America\\"Graser Schornstheimer, \\"Chile as a Naval Power\\", The New York Times, 22 August 1920, X10. would start another naval arms race.Livermore, \\"Battleship Diplomacy\\", 48. In the end, Chile purchased only Canada and four destroyers in April 1920, all of which had been ordered by Chile prior to the war's outbreak and requisitioned by the British for the war. The total cost of the five ships was less than a third of what Chile was due to pay for Almirante Latorre in 1914. Canada was renamed Almirante Latorre once again and formally handed over to the Chilean government on 27 November 1920. It departed Plymouth the same day with two of the destroyers, and ,\\"Chile's War Fleet Sails\\", The New York Times, 28 November 1920, 12. under the command of Admiral Luis Gomez Carre√±o. They arrived in Chile on 20 February 1921, where they were welcomed by Chile's president, Arturo Alessandri. Almirante Latorre was made the flagship of the navy. In its capacity as flagship of the Chilean Navy, Almirante Latorre was frequently utilized by the president for various functions. In the aftermath of the magnitude 8.5 1922 Vallenar earthquake, Almirante Latorre was used to transport Alessandri to the affected area. The ship also brought \\"tents, medical supplies, rations, clothing and 2,000,000 pesos\\" for those affected.\\"More Earthquakes Hit Northern Chile\\", The New York Times, 16 November 1922, 3. By 1923, Chile only had Almirante Latorre, a cruiser, and five destroyers in commission, leading The New York Times to remark \\"experts would probably place Chile third in potential sea power [after Brazil and Argentina]\\". While Almirante Latorre was individually more powerful than the Brazilian or Argentine dreadnoughts, they had two each to Chile's one. Compounding this was a lack of modern cruisers to accompany the lone dreadnought.\\"Armament Limitation at Santiago\\", The New York Times, 21 March 1923, 16. In 1924, Almirante Latorre hosted the president again when he visited Talcahuano for the grand opening of a new naval drydock there. After the fall of the January Junta in 1925, the dreadnought hosted the returning President Alessandri during a Naval Review in Valpara√≠so; while on board, he gave a speech to senior naval officials to assure them that his new government \\"was for all Chileans, and not partisan in its inspiration\\".Somervell, \\"Naval Affairs\\", 393. In September, the last month of his term, Alessandri received the United Kingdom's Edward, Prince of Wales, on board the battleship. The visit briefly quelled domestic unrest, and it marked the beginning of negotiations for a British naval mission, which arrived in the following year.Somervell, \\"Naval Affairs\\", 393‚Äì94. Almirante Latorre was sent to the United Kingdom for a modernization at the Devonport Dockyard in 1929. Departing Chile on 15 May, it traveled past Balboa before traversing the Panama Canal nine days later. After refueling at Port of Spain on 28 May, the dreadnought continued across the Atlantic, passing the Azores before arriving in Plymouth on 24 June.Whitley, Battleships of World War Two, 33. Major alterations included rebuilding the bridge, updating the main battery fire control to more modern standards and adding it for the secondary armament for the first time, and replacing its steam turbine engines. Also added were a new mast between the third and fourth turrets, anti-torpedo bulges similar to the British s, and new anti-aircraft guns. Nearly two years after the modernization began, Almirante Latorre sailed back to Valpara√≠so on 5 March 1931 and put in on 12 April. Two tug boats which had been acquired for use in the harbors of Punta Arenas and Valpara√≠so were carried on the battleship's deck during its voyage back to Chile. = 1931 mutiny = Almirante Latorre from the bow, date unknown. Despite the goodwill brought on by the removal of the \\"strongman\\"Sater, \\"Kronstadt\\", 241. President Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo in July 1931, Chile could not overcome the Great Depression's severe economic effects, and wages for civil servants making over 3,000 pesos a year were cut by 12‚Äì30 percent to reduce government expenditures. This triggered a severe reaction among the sailors of the navy, who had already suffered a 10 percent salary cut and 50 percent loss in overseas bonuses. Various members of the crew on board Almirante Latorre, but no officers, met on 31 August and decided that a mutiny was the best course of action.Scheina, Naval History, 107.Scheina, Latin America's Wars, 74.Sater, \\"Kronstadt\\", 241‚Äì43. Shortly after midnight on 1 September, the junior crew members of Almirante Latorre, an armored cruiser (), seven destroyers, and a few submarines took over their ships while many of their shipmates were watching a boxing tournament in La Serena. They imprisoned the officers, most without conflict, and secured the ships by about 02:00. They elected a committee, the Estado Mayor de Tripulacion, to take control of the mutiny. Later that day, at 16:55, the mutineers radioed the minister of the navy, declaring that they were acting on their own accord, as opposed to acting in concert with a militant political party or communist insurgents. They asked for their full salaries to be restored and the punishment of those who had plunged Chile into a depression, while also stating that they would not use force to achieve these goals.Scheina, Naval History, 107‚Äì09. Just before midnight on 2 September, the mutineers messaged the Chilean government with a more \\"sophisticated\\"Quote from an \\"observer\\" given in Sater, \\"Kronstadt\\", 245. list of twelve demands. Meanwhile, further south, junior members of the navy in the main naval base of Talcahuano joined the mutiny, taking several vessels in the process. Several of these sailed north to join the other rebels, while two cruisers, a few destroyers and submarines remained to guard the base. Other bases joined the now-full-fledged rebellion as well, including the Second Air Group based in Quintero. With so many rebels appearing, it was feared by many that the plethora of unemployed workers would join. The government attempted to solicit aid from the United States in the form of military intervention or war materiel (including two submarines and bombs capable of penetrating the armor of Almirante Latorre), but they were rebuffed both publicly and privately. Acting Vice President Manuel Trucco now found himself in an undesirable position; he had to defeat the rebels before more units joined and bolstered their forces, but if he was too harsh, there was a risk that the populace would think that his policies were too similar to the former dictator Ib√°√±ez del Campo. Trucco decided on a path of reconciliation. He sent a naval admiral, Edgardo von Schroeders, to negotiate with the mutineers. They met on board Almirante Latorre, where von Schroeders, seeing a potential split between sailors angry over their pay versus others with a more political agenda, tried to divide them along these lines and get them to surrender. However, a plea from the approaching southern fleet, asking for them to wait before any possible settlement, sealed the matter for the time being and von Schroders flew back to the capital.Sater, \\"Kronstadt\\", 244, 247‚Äì50. September marked a turn in the rebels' fortunes, despite the arrival of the southern fleet on 4 September. All of their land gains were taken by government forces, leaving only the fleet in the mutineers' hands. By the next day, an air strike was mounted by government forces. The only damage done was to the submarine H4, which was unable to dive, but at least one bomb landed about from Almirante Latorre. Despite the scant damage, the attack broke the mutineers' spirits; they quickly offered to send a delegation to Santiago to discuss terms, but the government, bolstered by its land victories, refused. While the mutiny devolved into arguing and anarchy, individual ships began leaving the bay and setting sail for Valpara√≠so, and the rest soon followed. Almirante Latorre ended up in the Bay of Tongoy with . Seven crewmen on the dreadnought received death sentences, later commuted to life in prison.Scheina, Naval History, 112‚Äì14.Scheina, Latin America's Wars, 76.Sater, \\"Kronstadt\\", 252‚Äì53, 255‚Äì56. = Later career = Looking down from Almirante Latorres bridge on the bow turrets, date unknown. Still in the midst of the depression, Almirante Latorre was deactivated at Talcahuano in 1933 to lessen government expenditures,\\"Chile Lays Up All Battleships in Drastic Economy Measure\\", The New York Times, 19 January 1933, 7. and only a caretaker crew was assigned to tend to the mothballed ship into the mid-1930s.Scheina, Naval History, 86, 359. In a 1937 refit in the Talcahuano dockyard, the aircraft catapult was taken off and anti-aircraft weaponry was added. Almirante Latorre was never fully modernized, however, and by the Second World War its main battery was comparatively short-ranged and its armor protection, designed before the \\"all or nothing\\" principle was put into practice, was wholly inadequate.Worth, Fleets of World War II, 7. Nevertheless, in 1939, US intelligence showed that the Soviet Union attempted to buy the ship,National Archives, File 1930‚Äì1939: 711.00111 Armament Control (Military Secrets)/723 ‚Äì 711.00111 sub no. 1651, 1692 and soon after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States Government approached the Chilean naval attach√© and the vice admiral heading Chile's naval commission to the United States with the aim of purchasing Almirante Latorre and a few destroyers to bolster the United States Navy. Both of these offers were declined,Scheina, Naval History, 164. and Almirante Latorre was used for neutrality patrols during the Second World War. After a 1951 accident in Almirante Latorres engine room killed three crewmen, the ship was kept moored in Talcahuano as a storage hulk for fuel oil. It was decommissioned in October 1958, and was sold to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in February 1959 for $881,110 to be broken up for scrap. On 29 May 1959, to the salutes of the assembled Chilean fleet, the old dreadnought was taken under tow by the tug Cambrian Salvos, and reached Yokohama, Japan, at the end of August,\\"Chilean Warship in Japan\\", The New York Times, 30 August 1959, S13. though the scrapping process did not begin immediately on arrival.

His father, Antonio Maria Gaetano Cartellieri, was Italian, and his mother, Elisabeth B√∂hm, was Latvian. Both of his parents were opera singers and he received his earliest musical education from them. When he was 13, his parents divorced, at which time Cartellieri moved with his mother to Berlin.

On 29‚Äì30 March 1795, the premi√®re of his oratorio Gioas re di Giuda took place in Wiener Burgtheater. (In the interval, Beethoven played his piano concerto which became Beethoven‚Äôs debut as a composer.) In 1796, Cartellieri was engaged by Prince Joseph Franz Maximilian Lobkowicz (1772‚Äì1817) as the Kapellmeister, singing teacher, and violinist, roles he held until his death 11 years later. His other duties at court included directing operas and playing the violin in both concerts of chamber music and symphonic music. He notably performed in the world premi√®res of several works by his friend Beethoven under the composer's baton, including the Eroica Symphony and the Triple Concerto on 23 January 1805.

Background Elizabeth was born to John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch, also known as the \\"Red Comyn\\", a powerful Scottish nobleman related to the Scottish crown, and Joan de Valence, the daughter of the French knight William de Valence, 1st Earl of Pembroke. She was the youngest of three children, with an elder sister, Joan de Comyn, and brother, John de Comyn. Her father was stabbed to death in 1306 by Robert the Bruce and Elizabeth and her siblings were sent south to England for their own safety. Joan married David II Strathbogie, the earl of Atholl, whilst her brother John later died at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, fighting Robert. Inheritance and kidnap In 1324 Elizabeth's uncle on her father's side, Aymer de Valence, the earl of Pembroke, died. Since he had no surviving children, Aymer's considerable lands were then divided amongst his sisters; Isabel de Valence had died in 1305, leaving her share to her son, John Hastings, whilst Elizabeth's mother left lands to her daughters Joan and Elizabeth. Joan inherited the manor and castle of Mitford, the manor of Ponteland, and lands in Little Eland, and the manor of Foston. Elizabeth inherited the powerful fortress of Goodrich Castle and the manor of Painswick. By the mid-1320s, however, England was in the grip of the oppressive rule of the Marcher lords Hugh le Despenser the older and his son Hugh Despenser the younger, the royal favourites of King Edward II.Doherty, pp.74-5. As part of a \\"sweeping revenge\\" on their rivals, especially in the Marches, the Despensers illegally seized a wide range of properties, particularly from vulnerable targets such as widows, or wives whose husbands were out of favour with the king.Weir, p.138. Despensers in an attempt to gain ownership of the powerful castle of Goodrich, shown here. John Hastings was effectively controlled by the Despensers and they ensured that he inherited an unequally large settlement of the Pembroke lands, anticipating that they would be able to marry him into their family and thereby acquire control of the estates themselves.Underhill, p.34. To deal with Elizabeth, however, stronger measures were necessary. Upon her inheritance, Hugh le Despenser the younger promptly kidnapped Elizabeth in London and transported her to Herefordshire to be imprisoned in her own castle at Goodrich.Hull and Whitehorne, p.37. Threatened with death, Elizabeth was finally forced to sign over the castle and other lands to the Despensers in April 1325.Rickard, p.37; Brayley and Tombleson, p.2. She was also forced to sign a debt notice of ¬£10,000, a huge sum,Prestwich, p.207. which was witnessed by John de Bousser, a corrupt royal justice.Fryde, p.115. Released, Elizabeth then married the English knight Richard Talbot, the 2nd Baron Talbot. Queen Isabella of France landed in England in late 1326 and deposed both the Despensers and her husband Edward II; Richard promptly seized Goodrich Castle from the Despensers, and Talbot and Elizabeth regained their legal title to the castle the following year.Rickard, p.242; Hull and Whitehorne, p.37. The Despensers were both executed on the queen's orders. Later years Elizabeth and Richard did well in the coming years. They had a son, Gilbert, in 1332.

After it was established in the mid-1960s, it was the most exclusive residential area on Jacksonville's Southside.Patton, Charlie: \\"Picture this: Deerwood, deserted\\" Florida Times-Union, February 21, 2003 The golf course hosted the Greater Jacksonville Open in the late 1960s and early 1970s, forerunner of The Players Championship, and was once the site of talks between President Gerald Ford and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in November 1975.Brune-Mathis, Karen: \\"Deerwood rift definitely newsworthy\\" Florida Times- Union, August 28, 2005 History =Skinner family= Richard Green Skinner came to Jacksonville in 1899 in search of pine trees for harvesting sap to produce turpentine for his marine supply business. Land to the south and east of the St. Johns River was mostly pine trees, sand dunes or marsh; inhabited by wildlife. After 1900, the Skinner family owned close to . That land was distributed to his six sons upon his death in the 1920s. The oldest brother, Bright, and two other brothers moved to Tampa and received the land owned there. The acreage nearest to the downtown went to Ben Skinner, who built the Skinner Dairy and Farm, which was closed and developed as Southpoint in the late 1970s. Chester and Richard were given the biggest tracts because the land was quite remote‚Äîmiles from existing roads.Patton, Charlie: \\"Piney Woods Miracle\\" Florida Times-Union, November 23, 2000 Richard Skinner, in turn, gave his children, Richard, Jr., Bryant, and Dottie his land, including the property on which Deerwood would be built. =Deerwood= Bryant built the golf course in 1960-61, designed on a limited budget by notable golf course architect George Cobb.Walsh, Greg: \\"Jacksonville's Deerwood gets new drainage, greens with major renovation\\" Jacksonville Golf, September 24, 2004 He then constructed the first home in the Deerwood development (his own) the following year. Brother Richard Jr. built his home there in 1963. In early 1962, Bryant began to outline and lay out a unique (for Jacksonville) and exclusive gated golf community that would become Deerwood. Within his rural Florida location he envisioned a neighborhood that incorporated curving roadways, panoramas, and distinctive homes on voluminous lots with large open common areas incorporating lakes, built around a country club that would feature golf, swimming and tennis.Beadling, Les: \\"President's Message\\" Deerwood Community News, Winter 2006 There was plenty of room for a riding stable and bridle paths. The development was named Deerwood because of an abundance of wildlife: turkeys, wild hogs, raccoons, bears and many deer. Bryant was confident that people would embrace it, but to get there from the established city required an eight-mile (13 km) drive down U.S. 1 (Philips Highway), then east for three bumpy miles on a rough dirt road named San Clerc, which would eventually become Baymeadows Road. In 1960, the area south of Beach Boulevard, east of US 1, and extending to the Intracoastal Waterway (approximately 50 square miles) was wilderness consisting of sand dunes and pine trees. In order to solve the problem of their isolated location, the Skinners donated land and convinced the Jacksonville Expressway Authority to build a road that would connect Beach Boulevard to Philips Highway. That thoroughfare, now called Southside Boulevard, opened Deerwood to development. In the 1970s, they gave land for State Road 202 (Butler Boulevard), which opened more of their property, as did the extension of Baymeadows Road, east from Southside Blvd to a point where State Road 9A (now I-295) was built. The Skinners also donated about for the campus of what is now the University of North Florida. =School= Jacksonville Country Day School was constructed at the southwest corner of Deerwood in 1960.\\"10063 BAYMEADOWS RD\\" Duval County Property Appraiser The school sold their of frontage on Southside Boulevard in 1989 for over $1 million to help pay for capital improvements.

(SWD), the largest mortgage banking, real estate and insurance business in Northeast Florida. The Skinners had abundant land, but not the financial resources necessary to develop his Deerwood project. J.J. Daniel became president of SWD in 1960 and made a deal to purchase Deerwood's from the Skinners. SWD financed the development of Deerwood Country Club. Bryant Skinner quit his job at SWD to concentrate on selling homes around the new golf course and started his own firm. The Bryant Skinner Company eventually became one of Jacksonville's most successful real estate development businesses. In 1980, they combined with Gate Petroleum to develop the Southpoint office park.Newboy: the Autobiography of Herbert Hill Peyton, page 145, Herbert Hill Peyton, Don Davis was named General Manager of Deerwood Country Club in 1965, a position he held for over 20 years. In 1978, Davis was promoted to Operations Vice President of SWD, responsible for all Deerwood Club operations, including the sale of residences and home sites. In 1979, 86 families lived at Deerwood. =Area development= Prior to the annexation of South Jacksonville in 1932, the city of Jacksonville occupied land on the north and west sides of the St. Johns River. The Ortega area was the refuge of Jacksonville's society and old money; a neighborhood of riverfront mansions and aristocratic estates. The Timuquana Country Club, founded in 1923, was their exclusive domain. The establishment and success of the Deerwood Country Club was the springboard that launched dramatic growth along Baymeadows Road and Southside Boulevard. Retail businesses, residential developments, apartments and commercial properties included \\"Deerwood\\" in their name to associate with the club's prestige. An article in the local newspaper in 2005 stated: > \\"Deerwood became the new place to live, the protected place to raise a > family and the coveted community for outsiders to snag a dinner invitation. > The Times-Union regularly featured its stylish homes and equally stylish > homeowners. Deerwood offered riding stables along with tennis courts, a pool > and, of course, what became a nationally known golf course.\\" Don Davis, a Jacksonville City Councilman for twelve years and State Legislator for eight years, commented, \\"I think the people on the other side of the river (Ortega) were quite astonished. They felt they were the first- class area in which to live. Then we had this new upstart on the Southside, on a dirt road, in the middle of nowhere.\\" =Gate= Gate Petroleum purchased the real estate assets of SWD in 1983, which included ownership of Deerwood Country Club. Gate also owned Epping Forest Yacht Club and Ponte Vedra Inn and Club, so Deerwood general manager Don Davis was hired by Gate and continued to operate and manage the club. Throughout the 1980s, the pace of development increased. In 1989, Gate built a convenience store and filling station at the intersection of Baymeadows Road and Southside Boulevard. A group of Deerwood homeowners tried to buy Deerwood for $3.1 million in 1990, but were unable to convince enough members to join the effort.Barker-Benfield, Simon: \\"Deerwood club may be in play\\" Florida Times-Union, April 28, 1999 At that time, there were 700 members. If 500 of them participated, it would have cost about $7,500 each.Barker-Benfield, Simon: \\"Deerwood owner asking $5 M\\" Florida Times-Union, June 3, 1999 At the end of the 1990s, new federal rules required more efficient use of water, and the irrigation system for the Deerwood golf course required major renovations. Nearly all of the building lots had been sold, leaving no opportunity for profitable income. In 1999, Gate founder Herb Peyton gave the club three choices: the members could buy the club assets; Gate could continue to operate the club for a management fee of 3% of revenues, plus dues; or the club could be sold to a third party.Barton, Susanna: \\"Peyton renovating one club, wants to get out of another\\" Jacksonville Business Journal, May 28, 1999 The club members agreed to buy the club assets for $5 million, becoming member-owned. This time, around 700 members agreed to participate, including 100 non-residents. To fund the purchase, refundable equity memberships were offered for $9,000, and associate (non-voting) memberships cost $3,500.Barker-Benfield, Simon: \\"Deerwood Club sold to members for $5M\\" Florida Times-Union, September 4, 1999 Trinidad, Alison: \\"Rift develops in Deerwood\\" Florida Times-Union, August 25, 2005 =Property= The Deerwood gated community was initially limited to single family residences for many years. Condominium developments, zero lot line homes, and courtyard communities were gradually included as the development matured and demand for them increased. Homesites ranged up to a estate, with some parcels, but the average lot is over ¬Ω acre.\\"Deerwood Golf & Country Club\\" Bring You Home Deerwood is now mostly built out, with approximately 900 families in homes priced above $400,000. The intersection of Baymeadows Road and Southside Boulevard, near the Deerwood entrance, is one of the busiest intersections in the city of Jacksonville. The Tinseltown commercial center is a couple of miles north. The Avenues Mall is south. And there are tens of thousands of people living in dozens of developments off Southside Boulevard and Baymeadows Road. Many homes in Deerwood are over forty years old, so it is not unusual for someone to demolish an older home and build a new custom home. Many of the larger properties are located on the east side of the development in a community known as \\"The Estates\\".\\"Deerwood Country Club Jacksonville\\" First Coast Real Estate The entrances are adorned with life-size bronze bucks and does; a reminder of a time when deer were plentiful and people were scarce. Country club Operations within the Deerwood Country Club are controlled by the Deerwood Board of Governors (DBG), elected by the Equity membership. =Facilities= The Deerwood Country Club has an 18-hole golf course & driving range, fitness center, Olympic-size swimming pool, tennis facility with 12 Har-Tru courts (8 lighted), and clubhouse. The original golf clubhouse, designed by KBJ Architects and constructed in the 1960s, was demolished after a new, clubhouse opened in December 2004. The new building is elevated to allow views of the natural beauty of the golf course and surrounding lakes. The facility has multiple private rooms for member functions, a formal dining room and shaded outdoor patio areas.\\"Dining\\" Deerwood Country Club The Deerwood Golf Course and its irrigation and drainage systems had significant renovation over eight months in 2004 that was long overdue. The painfully flat course was given contours to move rainwater to underground drainage and features that were omitted in 1961 due to financial constraints were added. Bunkers were reconstructed and several of the severe doglegs (bends) were straightened somewhat. A new cart facility and putting green were also included.\\"Golf\\" Deerwood Country Club =Membership= When Deerwood first opened, every resident belonged to the Country Club because membership was connected to property ownership. That changed over the years as homes were bought and sold, and memberships became more flexible based on each owner's preferences. There are two classes of membership, but all members have access to dining, social events, fitness center and swimming pool. Equity membership entitles the member to vote and hold office and has monetary value. Equity members can also purchase Partner privileges for priority access to activities and special benefits. Associate members have no voice in how the club is run.\\"Membership Opportunities\\" Deerwood Country Club website Today, only 51% of the Deerwood residents are members of the Country Club. Part of that is financial; the equity initiation fee was $21,000 in 2005, with monthly dues of $349 for a golf membership. However, there are about 100 non-residents who are Deerwood Country Club members. When the Deerwood Board of Governors made the decision to build a new clubhouse and renovate the golf course at a cost estimated at $9.5 million, all Equity members were assessed a fee to pay for it. Membership dropped from 700 in 2000 to approximately 500 in January 2004, when the project began. Approximately 25% of the members did not pay it, leaving the club with a $6M debt. =Asset sale= To generate funds to reduce the Deerwood Country Club's financial burden, it was discovered that the club owned land that could be sold for development. In the summer of 2005, a local developer paid $2.6 million to purchase on the north end of the country club‚Äîthe last large undeveloped parcel, which was mostly wetlands once viewed as too expensive to utilize. The Collins Group plotted 26 homesites on a new thoroughfare named Collins Grove Road for multimillion-dollar homes while reserving for conservation.Flaisig, Liz: \\"Developer pays $2.6M for Deerwood tract\\" Jacksonville Business Journal, August 29, 2005 The homes were expected to be a minimum of , with a total cost starting at $1.5 million. Gated community Operations within the Deerwood residential community are controlled by the Deerwood Improvement Association (DIA), the community's homeowner's association. Their leadership is elected by the Voting membership. Deerwood Improvement Association logo =CC&R;= Every deed in Deerwood includes a comprehensive set of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions which establish and permit enforcement of standards. They enable the controlled access to the community, and authorize the Deerwood Improvement Association to fund their activities and provide infrastructure including recreational areas, drainage, road maintenance and common areas. KBJ Architects developed the design standards for residential developments at Deerwood, which were also used at Amelia Island Plantation.Kerr, Jessie-Lynne: \\"Architect transformed city waterfront\\" Florida Times-Union, January 24, 2008 =Facilities= The DIA manages the recreation area that includes a community walk, basketball court, multi-purpose ball field, unique playground and pavilion. Other common areas include traffic islands and the two property entrances;\\"Landscape Committee\\" Deerwood Improvement Association website of paved streets and street lights, the storm drainage system and 45 lakes.\\"Grounds Committee\\" Deerwood Improvement Association website =Membership= The DIA is an organization mandated in the Deerwood deed covenants, composed of elected Deerwood homeowners, all of whom are automatically association members. As part of Gate's sale of Deerwood in 1999, ownership of the common areas was transferred to the DIA. At that time, the DIA automatic membership did not include voting rights, which were offered for a one-time fee of $3,000 and were transferable if the member's property was sold. Nearly two-thirds of the homeowners purchased this benefit, all but 84 of these homeowners paid the $9,000 Equity Fee plus the $3,000 fee to join the Club. =Functions= The DIA budget for 2010 was over $1.75 million. Each of the 920+ homeowners and 29 lot owners were assessed an annual fee of $1,900 in 2010 to support the activities of the DIA.\\"2010 Budget\\" Deerwood Improvement Association website The DIA board of directors is composed of 11 members, elected to staggered 3-year terms, with officers including president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer. Non-officers chair one of these committees: Standards, Architectural Review, Access Control and Safety, Grounds, Landscape, and Communication/Newsletter.\\"Board & Committees\\" Deerwood Improvement Association website\\"Who We Are\\" Deerwood Improvement Association website The DIA engages the services of a professional property manager, whose office handles the day- to-day operations and is the primary contact for residents. The property manager works with all the committees, provides them with assistance and coordinates their activities. The most expensive support activity was Community Access, which cost over $600,000; Repairs and Maintenance was $400,000; Property Management was $120,000; and finally, Utilities were almost $100,000. Rift The 2005 sale of helped the Deerwood Board of Governors reduce their debt by $2.6 million, but not everyone was happy. A group of neighbors who built homes in 1992 on property that abuts the new development said they were assured that the wetlands would not be developed, but it was just a handshake agreement. They filed suit to block the sale, but received almost no sympathy from other homeowners and were shunned or harassed by club members and residents. They dropped the lawsuit when the developer agreed to negotiated buffers, and resigned themselves to the inevitability that their quiet cul-de-sac would become a thoroughfare for construction vehicles followed by residential traffic. The secretary of the Board of Governors stated that the sale was best for the club. When asked why residents and club members weren't notified of the sale, he said, \\"We did not consult with the general membership, and we did not consult with the neighborhood. It really was none of their business.\\" A real estate consultant who analyzed the secretive sale compared the property to Palencia, an upscale golf community in St. Augustine where equivalent parcels sold for over $300,000. Based on that, the developer, who is both a Deerwood homeowner and club member, could net as much as $4 million profit in the insider deal. The consultant stated that if the club had done their homework, they probably could have earned more from the sale.

It looks like a manifold at most of its points, but it may contain singularities. For example, the cone of solutions of z^2=x^2+y^2 forms a pseudomanifold. Figure 1: A pinched torus A pseudomanifold can be regarded as a combinatorial realisation of the general idea of a manifold with singularities. The concepts of orientability, orientation and degree of a mapping make sense for pseudomanifolds and moreover, within the combinatorial approach, pseudomanifolds form the natural domain of definition for these concepts.  Definition  A topological space X endowed with a triangulation K is an n-dimensional pseudomanifold if the following conditions hold: # (pure) is the union of all n-simplices. # Every is a face of exactly one or two n-simplices for n > 1. # For every pair of n-simplices œÉ and œÉ' in K, there is a sequence of n-simplices such that the intersection is an for all i = 0, ..., k‚àí1. = Implications of the definition = *Condition 2 means that X is a non- branching simplicial complex. *Condition 3 means that X is a strongly connected simplicial complex. *If we require Condition 2 to hold only for in sequences of in Condition 3, we obtain an equivalent definition only for n=2. For n‚â•3 there are examples of combinatorial non-pseudomanifolds that are strongly connected through sequences of satisfying Condition 2. = Decomposition = Strongly connected n-complexes can always assembled from gluing just two of them at . However, in general, construction by gluing can lead to non-pseudomanifoldness (see Figure 2). Figure 2: Gluing a manifold along manifold edges (in green) may create non-pseudomanifold edges (in red). A decomposition is possible cutting (in blue) at a singular edgeNevertheless it is always possible to decompose a non-pseudomanifold surface into manifold parts cutting only at singular edges and vertices (see Figure 2 in blue). For some surfaces several non-equivalent options are possible (see Figure 3). Figure 3: The non pseudomanifold surface on the left can be decomposed into an orientable manifold (central) or into a non-orientable one (on the right). On the other hand, in higher dimension, for n>2, the situation becomes rather tricky. * In general, for n‚â•3, n-pseudomanifolds cannot be decomposed into manifold parts only by cutting at singularities (see Figure 4). Figure 4: Two 3-pseudomanifolds with singularities (in red) that cannot be broken into manifold parts only by cutting at singularities. * For n‚â•3, there are n-complexes that cannot be decomposed, even into pseudomanifold parts, only by cutting at singularities .

Examples  *A pinched torus (see Figure 1) is an example of an orientable, compact 2-dimensional pseudomanifold. (Note that a pinched torus is not a normal pseudomanifold, since the link of a vertex is not connected.) * Complex algebraic varieties (even with singularities) are examples of pseudomanifolds. (Note that real algebraic varieties aren't always pseudomanifolds, since their singularities can be of codimension 1, take xy=0 for example.) * Thom spaces of vector bundles over triangulable compact manifolds are examples of pseudomanifolds. * Triangulable, compact, connected, homology manifolds over Z are examples of pseudomanifolds. * Complexes obtained gluing two 4-simplices at a common tetrahedron are a proper superset of 4-pseudomanifolds used in spin foam formulation of loop quantum gravity . * Combinatorial n-complexes defined by gluing two at a are not always n-pseudomanifolds.

The network includes five hospitals, ElderONE/PACE (Program for All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly) and home health programs, outpatient laboratories, rehabilitation programs and surgical centers, independent and assisted living centers and skilled nursing facilities. They serve families in communities from the Greater Rochester area across Western New York and the Finger Lakes region. Rochester Regional Health is Rochester's second-largest employer. History In February 2003, Rochester General Health System (then called ViaHealth) and Unity Health System opened merger discussions, but the discussions ended in April 2004, when Rochester General's board of directors voted unanimously to reject the merger. The disagreement was partly due to the differences in ViaHealth wanting to merge its medical and dental staff, and Unity Health System the opposite. Merger discussions began again in April 2013, in response to incentives built by the Federal Affordable Care Act, but also New York State regulations and increasing pressure for better outcomes and lower costs from business and commercial insurers. In July 2014, Rochester General Health System and Unity Health System merged. The new system was referred to as \\"RU system\\" or \\"Newco\\" for a short time until the new board of directors selected the name Rochester Regional Health System. In January 2015, United Memorial Medical Center joined the system. Clifton Springs Hospital & Clinic joined the system in April 2015. The hospitals joined due to the difficulty for small-town rural health clinics to be financially viable and to attract and retain adequate medical staff. In May 2015, the system shortened its name to Rochester Regional Health. Hospitals & Facilities =Rochester General Hospital= Rochester General Hospital, Rochester NY * Rochester General Hospital, a 528-bed acute-care facility with a medical and dental staff of 1,500 that provides services including emergency, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, neurology.

UMMC joined the Rochester Regional Health family of hospitals in late 2016, but still kept its original name, and manages its own board of directors.  ACM Global Laboratories  Originally started in 1975, ACM Global Laboratories (formerly ACM Medical Laboratories) was an affiliate of Unity Health System, and was acquired with the merging of both Rochester General and Unity Health Systems. ACM Medical Laboratories provided both ambulatory and outpatient lab services for physicians and other health care providers, hospitals, employers and patients. Now a wholly owned affiliate of Rochester Regional Health, ACM changed its name from ACM Medical Laboratories to ACM Global Laboratories to reflect its global footprint as a provider in medical diagnostic and clinical trial testing services. They operate in over 65 countries, with facilities in Rochester, NY, England, China, India, and Singapore. They still provide all patient lab services in Rochester, NY under the name Rochester Regional Health Laboratories, but a majority of their operations are business-to-business. ACM specializes in Pathology Services, Anatomic Pathology, Micro and Molecular Diagnostics, Digital Pathology, Drug Testing Services, Microbiology, Pain and Addiction Management Services, as well as Flow Cytometry. In June 2018, ACM Global Laboratories acquired ABS Laboratories, a bioanalytical testing facility located in London, United Kingdom.  Sustainability  On October 20, 2017, Rochester Regional Health announced one of the most aggressive healthcare sustainability project in the United States. By 2025 the health system wants to source 100% of their electrical power from renewable means. In order to achieve this goal, the health system will reduce electricity use through updating facility equipment, increase on and off-site generation of renewable energy by adding things like solar panels, and commit to only purchasing renewable electricity when they need to purchase electricity. By the end of 2025 the company anticipates it will spend $1.5 Million less in electricity needs throughout the entire health system than it does today. Rochester Regional Health also has aggressive plans to spearhead sustainability in healthcare that include energy efficiency, waste management, sustainable purchasing, building design, food sourcing, and community outreach and education. Practice Greenhealth said Rochester Regional Health's announcement of this initiative is the most ambitious sustainability commitment shared publicly by any health system is New York State, and is matched or exceeded by only a handful of other health systems in the nation.  Mobile Mammography Center  In late 2017, New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo announced plans to fund $37.7 Million to help improve access to breast cancer screenings in New York State. Rochester Regional Health was among the recipients for this award to build a Mobile Mammography Center. Introduced in July 2018, the retrofitted RV-style vehicle is equipped with the same as a standing mammography suite, and will travel to and from Monroe County and the seven surrounding counties. Rochester Regional Health received a three-year grant for up to $4 million total.

Eurhythmics was developed in the early 20th century by Swiss musician and educator √âmile Jaques-Dalcroze. Dalcroze eurhythmics teaches concepts of rhythm, structure, and musical expression using movement, and is the concept for which Dalcroze is best known. It focuses on allowing the student to gain physical awareness and experience of music through training that takes place through all of the senses, particularly kinesthetic. Eurhythmics often introduces a musical concept through movement before the students learn about its visual representation. This sequence translates to heightened body awareness and an association of rhythm with a physical experience for the student, reinforcing concepts kinesthetically. Eurhythmics has wide-ranging applications and benefits and can be taught to a variety of age groups. Eurhythmics classes for all ages share a common goal ‚Äì to provide the music student with a solid rhythmic foundation through movement in order to enhance musical expression and understanding. The origin of the word \\"Eurhythmics\\" is \\"eurythmy\\" + \\"-ics\\". √âmile Jaques-Dalcroze and the origins of eurhythmics √âmile Jaques- Dalcroze Jaques-Dalcroze was appointed Professor of Harmony at the Conservatoire of Geneva in 1892, early in his career. As he taught his classes, he noticed that his students deeply needed an approach to learning music that included a kinesthetic component. He believed that in order to enhance and maximize musical expression, students needed to be trained early on to listen and appreciate music using both their minds and bodies. This coordination of mind and physical instincts formed the basis of his method. Ready to develop and employ an improved, integrated style of music education at the Conservatoire, Dalcroze discovered some obstacles. He found that students with innate rhythmic abilities were rare, just as are those with absolute, or \\"perfect,\\" pitch. In response to his observations, he asserted that in order to develop rhythmic ability in his students, he must first, and as early as possible in their development, train them in exercises that utilized the entire body. Only when the student's muscles and motor skills were developed could they be properly equipped to interpret and understand musical ideas. As he mentioned in the foreword of his \\"Rhythm, Music, and Education,\\" he sought the \\"connection between instincts for pitch and movement‚Ä¶time and energy, dynamics, and space, music and character, music and temperament, [and] finally the art of music and the art of dancing.‚Äù Because of the nature of his goals in expanding music education, his ideas are readily applicable to young students. An objective of his was to \\"musicalize\\" young children in order to prepare them for musical expression in future instrumental studies. He believed exposure to music, an expanded understanding of how to listen, and the training of gross and fine motor skills would yield faster progress later on in students‚Äô musical studies. Related to this was his goal to sow the seeds of musical appreciation for future generations. As stated concisely by Claire-Lise Dutoit in her \\"Music Movement Therapy,\\" successful eurhythmics lessons have the following three attributes in common: ‚ÄúThe vital enjoyment of rhythmic movement and the confidence that it gives; the ability to hear, understand and express music in movement; [and] the call made on the pupil to improvise and develop freely his own ideas.‚Äù Influences on the development of eurhythmics Before taking a post teaching theory, √âmile Jaques-Dalcroze spent a year as a conductor in Algiers, where he was exposed to a rhythmic complexity that helped influence him to pay special attention to rhythmic aspects of music. Jaques-Dalcroze also had an important friendship with √âdouard Clapar√®de, the renowned psychologist. In particular, their collaboration resulted in eurhythmics often employing games of change and quick reaction in order to focus attention and increase learning. Current applications General education Eurhythmics classes are often offered as an addition to general education programs, whether in preschools, grade schools, or secondary schools. In this setting, the objectives of eurhythmics classes are to introduce students with a variety of musical backgrounds to musical concepts through movement without a specific performance-related goal. For younger students, eurhythmics activities often imitate play. Games include musical storytelling, which associates different types of music with corresponding movements of the characters in a story. The youngest of students, who are typically experiencing their first exposure to musical knowledge in a eurhythmics class, learn to correlate types of notes with familiar movement; for example the quarter note is represented as a \\"walking note.\\" As they progress, their musical vocabulary is expanded and reinforced through movement. Performance-based applications While eurhythmics classes can be taught to general populations of students, they are also effective when geared toward music schools, either preparing students to begin instrumental studies or serving as a supplement to students who have already begun musical performance. Aspects of a rhythmic curriculum Vocabulary Eurhythmics classes for students in elementary school through college and beyond can benefit from a rhythmic curriculum that explores rhythmic vocabulary. This vocabulary can be introduced and utilized in a number of different ways, but the primary objective of this component is to familiarize students with rhythmic possibilities and expand their horizons. Activities such as rhythmic dictation, composition, and the performance of rhythmic canons and polyrhythms can accommodate a wide range of meters and vocabulary. In particular, vocabulary can be organized according to number of subdivisions of the pulse. Movement A key component of a rhythmic education, movement provides another way of reinforcing rhythmic concepts - kinesthetic learning serves as a supplement to visual and aural learning. While the study of traditional classroom music theory reinforces concepts visually and encourages students to develop aural skills, the study of eurhythmics solidifies these concepts through movement. In younger students, the movement aspect of a rhythmic curriculum also develops musculature and gross motor skills. Ideally, most activities that are explored in eurhythmics classes should include some sort of kinesthetic reinforcement. Meter and Syncopation Another element of a rhythmic curriculum is the exploration of meter and syncopation. In particular, the study of meter should incorporate an organization of pulses and subdivisions. This organization can be expressed in a \\"meter chart,\\" which can include both equal-beat and unequal-beat meters. The study of syncopation, a broad term that can involve a variety of rhythms that fall unexpectedly or somehow displace the pulse, is also essential in a rhythmic education. Eurhythmics classes can incorporate various activities to explore syncopation, including complex rhythmic dictations, the performance of syncopated rhythms, the exploration of syncopated rhythms in canon, and a general discussion of syncopated vocabulary. Sample activities Ages 3‚Äì6: * Warm-up activities: The students isolate and shake each body part, each one accompanied by different music. * Notes: Students learn about musical notation through associated movements. For example, quarter notes would be taught as ‚Äúwalking notes‚Äù. After familiarity with associated movements, note names are then introduced. * Storytelling: The teacher invents a story or uses a familiar storyline to incorporate rhythmic concepts * Ball games: Students pass a ball around in different ways, exploring naturally occurring rhythm and developing motor skills * Games with sticks: The students jump across a series of sticks on the floor, learning to coordinate body parts and their associated rhythm. * Drum activities: The students participate with small drums, getting to reproduce rhythm in an instrumental context Ages 7+ (activities can be adapted to different age groups) * Swings: The teacher plays music improvised in a preset metrical pattern. The students use prescribed body motions to determine the pattern. * Rhythmic dictation: The teacher plays a number of measures of music repeatedly, the rhythm of which the students dictate. * Rhythms: Students clap or step a predetermined rhythmic pattern. The teacher can experiment with augmentation and diminution. * Small group activities: Students work together in small groups to accomplish rhythmic tasks, encouraging cooperation. * Ball games: Students pass a ball around in different ways, exploring naturally occurring rhythm and developing motor skills. * Tempos: Students work to discover different tempos that can be applied to classical repertoire, familiar songs, or everyday movements. The teacher can also lead in experimenting with tempo relationships and adjustment. * Polyrhythms: The teacher establishes two rhythms to be performed at once, one in the hands and one in the feet. * Cross rhythms: Students produce one even rhythm in the hands against another even rhythm in the feet. The teacher prompts them to switch which rhythm is produced in each body part. * ‚ÄúCosmic Whole Note‚Äù: Students listen to a slow pulse (an example would be 6 beats per minute), subdivide the space between sounds, and predict when the next pulse sounds by clapping. * Canon: Students listen to rhythmic vocabulary performed by the teacher and step this vocabulary in canon. This activity can be executed in a variety of meters. * ‚ÄúMicrobeats‚Äù: Students learn syllables to represent 1-9 subdivisions of a beat. Associated activities could include performing microbeats in prescribed patterns, at varying tempi, in canon, or as sight-reading. Effectiveness of Dalcroze eurhythmics A group of 72 pre- school children were tested on their rhythmic ability; half of the children had free-play (35‚Äì40 min.) twice a week for a 10-week period while the other half had rhythmic movement classes for the same amount of time. The group that had classes (experimental group) did significantly better than the group that just had free-play (control group). The experiment group scored four or more points better in every area tested than the control group in the final test. This shows that eurhythmic classes can benefit a child‚Äôs sense of rhythm.Zachopoulou, Evridiki, Vassiliki Drri, Dimitris Chatzopoulou, Theordoros Elinoudis.

Mural painting from the catacomb Feasts of Jesus Christ are specific days of the year distinguished in the liturgical calendar as being significant days for the celebration of events in the life of Jesus Christ and his veneration, for the commemoration of his relics, signs and miracles. While Easter is treated everywhere as the central religious feast in the Christian liturgical year, the other feasts differ in the liturgical practice.  Feast days of Jesus in the Catholic Church  Since the Second Vatican Council, the Catholic liturgical calendar distinguishes four ranks of celebrations: solemnities, feasts, memorials, and optional memorials. Most of the celebrations of events in the life of Christ are ranked as solemnities. However, there are a few celebrations related to titles or mysteries of Christ which are ranked as feasts, and these are known collectively as \\"Feasts of the Lord.\\" In the current General Calendar from the Third Edition of the Roman Missal, these are: * The Holy Family of Jesus, Mary and Joseph, celebrated on the Sunday between December 25 and January 1, or if there is no Sunday in that range (when December 25 and January 1 fall on Sundays), on December 30.Ordo Lectionum Missae, Editio Typica Altera (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1981). * The Baptism of the Lord, celebrated on the Sunday after January 6 (or, where the Solemnity of the Epiphany is transferred to the Sunday that occurs on January 7 or 8, on the following Monday) * The Presentation of the Lord, celebrated on 2 February * The Transfiguration of the Lord, celebrated on 6 August * The Exaltation of the Holy Cross, celebrated on 14 September * The Dedication of the Lateran Basilica, celebrated on 9 November (this is a feast of the Lord because the basilica is dedicated to him under the title of the Most Holy Saviour). In the pre-Vatican II usage, the term feast denoted any celebration, not just a specific rank. Hence, also celebrations which are today termed solemnities of the Lord (e.g. Christmas, Easter, Pentecost, Christ the King) were once deemed Feasts of the Lord.  Feast days of Jesus in the Orthodox Church  Three main categories of feasts, distinguished in the Orthodox liturgical practice, namely * Feasts of the Lord Jesus Christ (, or ) * Feasts of the Theotokos (; by definition same to Marian feast days, the actual set differs between Catholic and Orthodox Churches) * Feasts of Saints While Easter is treated as Feast of Feasts, the following eight feasts of Christ are assigned the highest rank of the Great Feasts in the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendars: * Feast of the Cross ‚Äî 14 (27) September * Christmas ‚Äî 25 December (7 January) * Baptism of Jesus ‚Äî 6 (19) January * Presentation of Jesus at the Temple ‚Äî 2 (15) February * Palm Sunday ‚Äî (Moveable feast) * Ascension of Jesus ‚Äî (Moveable feast) * Pentecost ‚Äî (Moveable feast) * Transfiguration of Jesus ‚Äî 6 (19) August Literature * –ù–∞—Å—Ç–æ–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∞ —Å–≤—è—â–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å–ª—É–∂–∏—Ç–µ–ª—è (Nastol‚Äônaya Kniga Sviashchenno- sluzhitelia), Volume 4, Moscow, 1983.

Hartford Distributors is a wholesale distributor of Budweiser beer products and wine. Given the options of being fired or resigning, Thornton signed the resignation papers and was being escorted out of the building. Instead of leaving, he took a Ruger SR9 semi-automatic pistol from his lunchbox and opened fire. At the time Thornton started shooting, there were around 40 employees in the building. In just a few minutes, Thornton murdered eight coworkers and seriously injured two others. Many employees made calls to 911, with some callers identifying Thornton. Police arrived on the scene just three minutes after the first 911 call. Police entered the building ten minutes after the first 911 call. Thornton promptly hid in a locked office. As more police entered the building, Thornton called his mother and explained to her what he had done. He told her he planned on turning the gun on himself. As police closed in, Thornton called 911, saying his motive for the massacre was racism he had experienced in the workplace. He told the 911 operator that he wished he had killed more people.

Its population during the 2000 Census was 142, and estimated to be 126 as of 2009. History Brandenburg Township was first settled in the mid-1870s by German immigrants, who originally named it Berlin. The original name came from George Worner (1855 - 1950), an early settler, who in 1875 established a rural post office on his homestead, and named it Berlin in honor of Berlin, Germany. Worner was born in Germany, and his family emigrated to the United States, settling in Wisconsin before moving to Dakota Territory around 1874. The Berlin post office was later moved in 1882 to a site near present-day Great Bend, North Dakota, and was closed permanently on July 12, 1883. Part of Great Bend was platted on Worner's homestead, and he instrumental in the city's development. Worner later served as county commissioner and in the North Dakota House of Representatives from 1925 to 1932. The township had been renamed Brandenburg by the time the 1890 Census was conducted. It reached a peak population of 552 people in 1900. Much of that population was absorbed into the city of Great Bend when it was incorporated in 1908 and became independent of the township.  Demographics  The 2000 Census reported 142 people, 44 households, and 31 families in the township. The population density was . There were 61 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 98.6% White, with 1.4% of the population reporting two or more races. Those that reported having German ancestry were nearly 80% of the population, reflecting the influence early German settlers had on the township. Of the township's 44 households, 47.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them. 63.6% of households were made up of married couples living together, and 29.5% were non-family households. The average household size was 3.23 and the average family size was 4.06. Brandenburg has a relatively young population, with a median age of 29.5 years. Roughly 73% of the population under the age of 45 in the year 2000. Those under the age of 18 made up the largest subsection of the population (43.7%), followed by 25- to 44-year-olds (29.6%) and 45- to 64-year-olds (16.2%). Just 6.3% of the population was over the age of 65. The median income for a household in the city was $51,458, and the median income for a family was $51,667.

Yohai was born on March 4, 1920, in Harlem to Jewish immigrants from Turkey and grew up in the Bronx. He earned his undergraduate degree in 1941 from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.Hevesi, Dennis. \\"Morrie Yohai, 90, the Man Behind Cheez Doodles, Is Dead\\", The New York Times, August 2, 2010. Accessed August 3, 2010. He worked for Grumman Aircraft after graduating from college and enlisted in the United States Navy during World War II. He pursued flight training, assuming that since he knew how to build planes he would know how to fly them. He was shifted to the United States Marine Corps and piloted planes in the South Pacific. Yohai was the president of Old London Foods, a food products company originally established in the 1920s by two men, Robert J. Yohai and Robert A. Yohai (his father and his cousin), as King Kone. The company had manufactured ice cream cones and would later produce cheese crackers, popcorn and Melba toast. The company was looking for a new snack in the 1950s and had a machine that could extrude cornmeal under pressure through a narrow hole that would be cut to three-inch lengths by a blade. Baked with orange cheddar cheese and flavorings, Yohai gave them the name \\"Cheez Doodles\\". The name came to him while he sat around the table with other employees sampling different alternatives for the cheese flavoring.Barrios, Jennifer. \\"Morrie Yohai, 90, helped create Cheez Doodle\\", Newsday, August 1, 2010.

Accessed August 3, 2010. Yohai recalled that one of his responsibilities involved making decisions as to which tiny toys would be included as prizes in packages of Cracker Jack. Yohai was proud of his association with Cheez Doodles, and fondly retained a photograph of Julia Child eating from a bag. Attending a 2004 display of a work by Sandy Skoglund at a Napa Valley museum depicting several life-size figures covered in Cheez Doodles, his wife proudly told the gathered guests that her husband had invented the product. Yohai left Borden after the company relocated to Columbus, Ohio. He started teaching at the New York Institute of Technology and was chosen to serve as the associate dean of the college's school of management. In his later years Yohai became involved with Jewish mysticism and Torah study. An author of two books and 500 poems, he was one of the founders of the annual New York Sephardic Jewish Film Festival. A resident of Kings Point, New York, he lived in a luxurious home on Long Island Sound, which his wife would call \\"the house that Cheez Doodles bought\\".

The album produced two singles, both with promotional videos. The first of these, Atmosfear has within it elements of Thrash Metal and Dance Music. The catchy ballad The Stage was also released as a single with accompanying video. These singles account for two of the three Waltari compositions to reach the top 20 in the Finnish charts. Atmosfear peaked at 6 and The Stage at 15. The album itself reached a high of 7 in the national charts and was their second most successful album.  Reception  Reviews are generally very good.

Significance of the name  The initiative claims that the name Cordoba was chosen to symbolize the time in history when Muslims, Jews, and Christians ostensibly lived together in peace and harmony and created a prosperous center of intellectual, spiritual, cultural and commercial life in the city of Cordoba in al-Andalus. http://historynewsnetwork.org/article1127499 Erick Stakelbeck, an investigative journalist and author, is one of a handful who believe that Cordoba represents the height of Islam's advance against the West, and that ever since its fall from Muslim hands, the faithful have yearned for its return to the Islamic fold.Erick Stakelbeck, The Terrorist Next Door, Regnery, 2011, p. 25.

The site includes a section called ‚ÄúVoices of Moderation.‚Äù The Shariah Index Project, for example seeks to address: What is the right balance between the institutions of religious and political authority in the modern state? Should religion and governance be legally separated, or is there a way to integrate the two? What is meant by religious law, and can it be implemented without endangering basic human rights? The Shariah Index Project seeks to answer these questions in the context of present-day Muslim society. It provides this vision: ‚Ä¢To demystify the notion, meaning and requirements of an Islamic state ‚Ä¢To clarify the principles of Shariah in the context of modern society ‚Ä¢To provide the general public, opinion leaders, and state officials in both the Muslim world and the West with tools for achieving these principles in practice.Cordoba Initiative Website/Shariah Index Project  Activities  ‚Ä¢The Initiative lists the following activities on their website: convening annual meetings of Islamic scholars, media appearances, lectures and publications, creating Cordoba House, shaping a strong and moderate Muslim-American community, building bridges with those of other faiths, combatting ‚ÄúIslamophobia‚Äù, and the Shariah Index Project, by which they say they will create a blueprint by which democracy will take place in the Muslim world. .Cordoba Initiative Website/Shariah Index Project It is best known for planning and advocating the proposed Islamic center known first as Cordoba House and later as Park51. Imam Feisal was first in charge of construction of the center.  Leadership  The Cordoba Initiative is the vision of Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf. Imam Feisal brings together leaders across the Muslim-West divide to speak out for innovative, proactive, and positive solutions to shared challenges. In this capacity, Cordoba Initiative can provide novel solutions to those areas where conflict between Islamic and Western communities undermine local and global security. The Initiative has three officers: Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, Chairman; John S. Bennett of the Aspen Institute; and Daisy Khan, the wife of Rauf.

Waterman, Jr. and Tom Peters (who also developed the MBWA-- \\"Management By Walking Around\\" motif, and authored In Search of Excellence) in the 1980s. This was a strategic vision for groups, to include businesses, business units, and teams. The 7 Ss are structure, strategy, systems, skills, style, staff and shared values. The model is most often used as an organizational analysis tool to assess and monitor changes in the internal situation of an organization. The model is based on the theory that, for an organization to perform well, these seven elements need to be aligned and mutually reinforcing. So, the model can be used to help identify what needs to be realigned to improve performance, or to maintain alignment (and performance) during other types of change. Whatever the type of change ‚Äì restructuring, new processes, organizational merger, new systems, change of leadership, and so on ‚Äì the model can be used to understand how the organizational elements are interrelated, and so ensure that the wider impact of changes made in one area is taken into consideration. History In 1977, McKinsey director Ron Daniel launched two projects. The first and major one, the Business Strategy project, was allocated to top consultants at McKinsey's New York City corporate HQ and was given significant resources. It was headed by Frederick Gluck, and despite promise, the project could not manage to effectively implement the new strategies. The second project was related to the problem of implementation: organizational effectiveness. This project was headed by Cleveland-based James Bennet. Peters states that directly after graduating with a PhD from Stanford and returning to McKinsey, Daniel handed him a \\"fascinating assignment.\\" Motivated by the new ideas coming from Bruce Henderson's Boston Consulting Group, Peters \\"was asked [by Daniel] to look at 'organization effectiveness' and 'implementation issues' in an inconsequential offshoot project nested in McKinsey's rather offbeat San Francisco office.\\" While Daniel's first project was focused on Business Strategy, this second project was concerned with \\"Organization\\" which Peters defined as involving \\"the structure-and-people side.\\". The \\"Organization\\" project was seen by Peters to be less important, according to Peters in a Fast Company interview. Despite being described as \\"marginal,\\" the project \\"had an infinite travel budget that allowed [Peters] to fly first-class and stay at top-notch hotels, and a license from McKinsey to talk to as many cool people as [he] could all around the United States and the world.\\" Peters admits that \\"There was no carefully designed work plan. There was no theory that I was out to prove. I went out and talked to genuinely smart, remarkably interesting, first-rate people.\\" In addition to Karl Weick and Einar Thorsrud, Peters notes that Douglas McGregor's theory of motivation, known as Theory X and Theory Y, was directly influential on the direction of the project. In a 1978 article, \\"Symbols, Patterns and Settings,\\" Peters argued that \\"shifting organizational structure\\" and \\"inventing new processes\\" - structure and system, respectively - were only two tools of organizational change. Peters then outlined eight \\"mundane\\" tools that every manager has at their fingertips. He described this article as a \\"tentative presentation\\" and \\"the first public expression of these ideas.\\" In 1979, McKinsey's Munich office requested Peters to present his findings to Siemens. That provided the spur for Peters to create a 700-slide two-day presentation. Word of the meeting reached the US and Peters was invited to present also to PepsiCo. However, unlike the hyper-organised Siemens, the PepsiCo management required a tighter format than 700 slides, so Tom Peters consolidated the presentation into eight themes. Each of these eight would form a chapter of In Search of Excellence. In 1980, Waterman joined Peters, and, along with Waterman's friend Tony Athos and Richard Pascale - both academics - came together at a two-day retreat in San Francisco to develop what would become known as the 7S Framework, the same framework that would organize In Search of Excellence. In June 1980, Peters published an op-ed in the Manager's Journal section of the Wall Street Journal titled \\"The Planning Fetish.\\"Peters, T. (1980). The Planning Fetish. Manager's Journal,\\" Wall Street Journal. In this article, he \\"stressed the importance of execution and dismissed the whole idea of strategy.\\" As strategy was McKinsey's main operation at the time, this was seen as a \\"frontal assault\\" on the company, leading Mike Bulkin, the head of the New York office, to demand that Daniel fire Peters. The primary \\"innovative\\" theme that undergirded what would become the well-known \\"In Search of Excellence\\" book was that \\"structure is not organization.\\" This also happened to be the title of a 1980 journal article authored by Bob Waterman, Tom Peters, and Julien Phillips in which they argue that the \\"picture of the thing is not the thing.... An organizational structure is not an organization.\\"Waterman, R. H., Peters, T. J., & Phillips, J. R. (1980). Structure is not organization. Business Horizons, 23(3), 14-26. This article also introduced what would become the McKinsey 7S Framework. In December 1981, Peters left the company after agreeing to a fifty percent royalty split with McKinsey. Later, co-author Waterman stayed at the firm for three more years but received no royalties from In Search of Excellence =In Search of Excellence= The work of Peters, Waterman, Athos, and Pascale leading up to the widely successful In Search of Excellence, not only elaborated the eight themes that would form each chapter, but also the 7 S's frame the different ways in which the firms profiled in the book were \\"excellent.\\" =The Art of Japanese Management= Athos and Pascale, although not named as co-authors of the 1982 publication of In Search of Excellence, published their own study in a 1981 book titled The Art of Japanese Management. This book used the 7S Framework to compare the Japanese firm Matsushita with the American company ITT. Just as Peters emphasized throughout his writing, the important distinction between American and Japanese management was not the so-called \\"hard\\" technical aspects of organization, but rather the \\"soft\\" cultural aspects.  Objective  (To analyze how well an organization is positioned to achieve its intended objective) Usage * Improve the performance of a company * Examine the likely effects of future changes within a company * Align departments and processes during a merger or acquisition * Determine how best to implement a proposed strategy The Seven Interdependent Elements * The basic premise of the model is that there are seven internal aspects of an organization that need to be aligned if it is to be successful Hard Elements * Strategy - Purpose of the business and the way the organization seeks to enhance its competitive advantage. * Structure - Division of activities; integration and coordination mechanisms. * Systems - Formal procedures for measurement, reward and resource allocation. Soft Elements * Shared Values * Skills - The organization's core competencies and distinctive capabilities. * Staff - Organization's human resources, demographic, educational and attitudinal characteristics. * Style - Typical behaviour patterns of key groups, such as managers, and other professionals. Limitations The framework gives rise to a few vital points, like: # What type of analysis is this? Or what is the action triggered after putting your organization into this drill? # Does this give you real guidelines as to how to proceed further, after the analysis is completed? # Do we treat this as a guideline or checklist and proceed with using other techniques to formulate further steps? # There have been other techniques in vogue which have to be used to arrive at actionable points. Here too, a similar approach may be needed, as a tool, to really put this into action. # The above seems to be an abstract list of generic elements in any organization. It does not spell out which steps are to be initiated to improve each business process, such as Marketing, Finance, Manufacturing etc. References External links * A Brief History of the 7-S (\\"McKinsey 7-S\\") Model - Tom Peters' blog post describing the origins of the model. * Structure is Not Organization -Business Horizons, June 1980.

Sometimes it may show a yellowish or orange tinge in the centre. It may measure between 6 and 20 cm in diameter. The flesh is white with a mild taste and without scent; it quickly becomes soft and spongy and also greyish. The crowded gills are cream coloured when young, and become yellow with age. They are adnexed and are generally thin. Their edges may sometimes occur reddish. The amyloid, elli spores measure 8-10 by 7-10 Œºm are warty and are covered by an incomplete mesh. The stem is white, sometimes with a pink hue, slightly clubbed. It may measure 5 to 15 cm in height and up to 3 cm in diameter. Distribution, ecology and habitat R. paludosa is mycorrhizal and occurs in coniferous woodlands and in peat bogs of Europe and North America; preferably under pine trees, where it forms mycorrhizae. Locally it can be very common. Edibility The mushroom is edible and is a common good in Finnish markets. Yet it may easily be mistaken for Russula emetica, which is poisonous.

Life Utendal was a native of Ghent, nowadays a Belgian city, but at the time part of Flanders and the Netherlands which were part of the Holy Roman Empire. Like many Flemish musicians and composers of his time, he served the Imperial family, the Habsburgs. He began already at a young age as a choirboy at the court of Mary of Hungary, sister of emperors Charles V and Ferdinand I of the Holy Roman Empire. She was given the position of Vogt (regent) of the Netherlands. In 1564, Utendal became alto of the court chapel of Archduke Ferdinand II of Tyrol, another member of the royal Habsburg family. After Ferdinand was made Archduke of Further Austria in 1564 after his father's death, he moved his court from Prague (he was the governor of Bohemia) to Innsbruck. Utendal followed his master to the Innsbruck court chapel to gain the position of vice chapel master in 1572 (as successor of Jacob Regnart); he was also in charge of the education of the choir boys. Until 1581, Utendal worked for Ferdinand II in Innsbruck, where he died. Many of his works are in honour of his master. He even refused the position of chapel master at the court of Dresden in 1580. Music Due to his position as vice-chapel master he mostly composed sacred works, although there are also two books known with French and German non-sacred songs. In his work the alto (high voice) is almost always the dominant one, maybe because he was an alto himself. He also used the madrigal fashion in his compositions, which is typical for the late or High Renaissance. All the original sacred compositions of Utendal still exist and they are conserved in many archives and libraries throughout Europe. His works were publicised in Nuremberg, in this time the most important centre of the German music press. Utendal wrote eighty-four motets.

Revista de M√∫sica Cl√°sica, n¬∫ 32 (2017), pp. 1-3.) was professor emeritus of musicology and philosophy at Rutgers University. He studied particularly the philosophy of music. Biography Kivy earned master's degrees in both philosophy (University of Michigan, 1958) and musicology (Yale University, 1960). He earned his PhD at Columbia University in 1966. He joined the faculty at Rutgers the following year, and became full professor in 1976. He taught there for his whole career except one year as a visiting professor at University of California, Santa Barbara. His early work was on the 18th- century British aesthetics, and was influenced by Francis Hutcheson. From there he developed an interest in analytic aesthetics. From the late 1970s on, he had been interested mainly in philosophy of music. His book The Corded Shell made him a central figure in musical aesthetics.Cumming. One preoccupation of his had been the problem of what it means for instrumental music to \\"express\\" an emotion. His answer is that common emotions have physical behavioral expression in people that can be understood by appearance and imitated in music; thus, music cannot express more complex emotions that do not have an obvious behavioral expression. A similar position is followed by Stephen Davies. Some criticism of Kivy's ideas is available in Music, Philosophy, and Modernity (2007) by Andrew Bowie and Filosof√≠a de la M√∫sica.

Sass's father and mother settled in London after their marriage and his elder half- brother Richard Sass became a landscape painter and art tutor to members of the royal family. Sass became a student at the Royal Academy and practised his art by copying paintings held at the British Institution. His early work which was exhibited in 1807 and 1808 at the Royal Academy included, \\"The Descent of Ulysses into Hell\\" which Sass also executed as an etching. However his later work was portraiture. In 1815 he married Mary Robinson, whose family was related to the Earls of Ripon. In the same year he travelled to Italy, returning two years later. However, despite publishing a book about his Italian tripHenry Sass. A journey to Rome and Naples, performed in 1817 (London: Longman, Hurst, Reese, Orme & Brown, 1818) he was not able to make a living from his painting. Sass decided to open the first school of drawing for artists who were intending to study at the Royal Academy' school. Sass established it in a house at No. 6 Charlotte Street, at the corner with Streatham Street, in Bloomsbury, London. Sass's pupils included Sir John Millais P.R.A., Charles West Cope K.A., William Powell Frith R.A., William Edward Frost R.A.P.R.A. = President of the Royal Academy; R.A. = Royal Academician. Sir Thomas Lawrence the President of the Royal Academy was amongst the school's supporters. Such was Sass's commitment to art education that Sir David Wilie said he could have taught a \\"stone to draw\\". Sass's Academy is caricatured in the novel \\"The Newcomes\\" by Thackeray, who was once a student at the school. The real academy, however, is only used as a basis for the fictional art school and Thackeray does not refer to Sass or his school in particular.Rowland McMaster. Thackeray's cultural frame of reference: allusion in The Newcomes (McGill-Queen's University Press, 1991) pp. 91-2. Sass was now well off and he and Mary entertained the intelligentsia of the day. Among his friends were Sir Edwin Landseer, William Etty, and particularly J. M. W. Turner. Two years before his death Sass passed the directorship of the school to Francis Stephen Cary due to his failing mental health. Sass died in 1844, having had nine children including an eldest surviving son, Henry William Sass who was an architect and Edwin Etty Sass who entered the medical profession.

He directed the 2006 film Right at Your Door and the 2011 film The Darkest Hour. Gorak began working in the film industry in the 1990s as an art director. In the 2000s, he worked on several films as a production designer before becoming a film director. Background Gorak attended Tulane University where he earned an architecture degree. He changed his career to film and worked as an art director for directors like David Fincher, the Coen brothers, and Terry Gilliam. When Gorak worked as production designer on the 2004 film The Clearing, he expressed afterward to its producers interest in film direction. They challenged him to provide something viable, and he wrote a script for an intended short film titled Right at Your Door. He eventually directed the 2006 feature thriller film Right at Your Door, which he said was reflective of authorities being impotent in a world after the September 11 attacks. He had initially worried about his film being too similar to 28 Days Later but found inspiration in filming on a low budget. After Right at Your Door, he planned to write and direct a cop drama titled SIS. The film was not realized, and Gorak instead directed the alien invasion film The Darkest Hour, released in 2011. In October 2013, Paramount Pictures bought Gorak's science fiction spec script Attach and began to develop a film, which Gorak is attached to direct. By February 2017, Attach was no longer under Paramount, and actor Alex Russell was cast to star in the film. Gorak is a member of the Art Directors Guild.

Trƒçka was engaged in parish missions during his ecclesial career but went on to also serve Greek Catholics and cater to the needs of the Eastern Rite Catholics who often felt neglected and in great need of pastoral assistance; this was something that Trƒçka was more than willing to provide for he made serious inroads in terms of the pastoral aid he provided to those people. Trƒçka was beatified in Saint Peter's Square on 4 November 2001. Life Dominik Trƒçka was born in 1886 in the Czech Republic as the last of seven children to Tomas Trƒçka and Frantiska Sterbova. He entered the Redemptorist novitiate in Bilsko in Poland in 1902 and he made his profession on 25 August 1904 before returning to Obo≈ôi≈°tƒõ in his homeland so that he could pursue the required philosophical and theological studies needed for ordination. On 17 July 1910 he received his ordination in Prague to the priesthood from Cardinal Lev Skrbensk√Ω z H≈ô√≠≈°tƒõ. He spent some time engaged in parish missions but in 1919 was sent to serve the Greek Catholics in Haliƒç in Slovakia while he studied the Eastern Rite in Lviv. Eastern Rite Catholics were often overlooked in number and importance but Trƒçka worked to readdress the situation and one of his most significant achievements was organizing the establishment in Michalovce of a convent for those Eastern Rite Redemptorist members. During World War I he tended to Slovenian and Croatian people and to those wounded in the Pribram hospital. In 1935 - when the Redemptorist communities of the area were reorganized - he was appointed as the vice- provincial of the Byzantine Redemptorists. With the Communist takeover of Czechoslovakia came a period of religious persecution and in 1950 religious communities were suppressed. On the evening of 13 April 1950 (which happened to be Holy Thursday) he was arrested along with several other Redemptorists. He was put on trial on 21 April and accused of attempting to obtain false papers in order to flee the nation and was sentenced to 12 years in prison. During his imprisonment he endured both torture and interrogation. One of his confreres who was released wrote that the religious were subjected to intense light non-stop. On 23 March 1959 he died at 9:00am as the result of pneumonia after having been placed in solitary confinement as a punishment for singing Christmas carols in 1958. His remains were buried at the prison but on 17 October 1969 were exhumed and placed in the Redemptorist vault in Michalovce. Beatification The beatification process commenced in Pre≈°ov in a diocesan process that concluded in 2001; the formal introduction came on 6 March 2001 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the \\"nihil obstat\\" and made him a Servant of God. The C.C.S. validated the process on 9 March 2001 and received the Positio dossier in 2001. Theologians approved this on 6 April 2001 as did the C.C.S. on 23 April 2001. Pope John Paul II confirmed that Trƒçka died in hatred of his faith on 24 April 2001 and the pope beatified him in Saint Peter's Square on 4 November 2001. The cause's progress lasted almost twelve months and was quite rapid. The current postulator for this cause is the Redemptorist priest Antonio Marrazzo.

Known as Rousby Hall Road, the state highway runs from Rousby Road in Drum Point north to MD 2 and MD 4 in Lusby. The portion of MD 760 in Lusby was built as MD 503 in the early 1930s; the Drum Point section was constructed as a county highway by 1939. MD 503 was removed from the state highway system in the late 1950s. MD 760 was designated in two sections in the early 1960s. Route description View north from the south end of MD 760 at Rousby Road in Drum Point MD 760 begins at Rousby Road on a peninsula adjacent to Solomons Island and the mouth of the Patuxent River. The state highway heads east and then northeast as a two-lane undivided road through the community of Drum Point. MD 760 curves north as it passes along the western edge of Chesapeake Ranch Estates and crosses Coles Creek. The state highway turns west and crosses Mill Creek into Lusby, where the highway meets Olivet Road and Southern Connector Boulevard at a roundabout, from which MD 760 continues north. MD 760 intersects MD 765 (H.G. Trueman Road) in a commercial area before reaching its northern terminus at a directional crossover intersection with MD 2 and MD 4, which run concurrently as Solomons Island Road. History MD 760's predecessor state highway was MD 503, which was assigned to the highway from MD 2 (now MD 765) in Lusby to the southern end of Olivet Road in community of Olivet on the peninsula between St. John Creek and Mill Creek. The portion of MD 760 in Drum Point was preceded by a series of streets, now part of residential subdivisions, that connected Lusby with the Drum Point Light. MD 503 was constructed as a gravel road in 1933. The Drum Point portion of MD 760 was constructed as a county highway by 1938 to provide access to the M.M. Davis Shipyard, a leading producer of yachts that was sited on Ship Point opposite Solomons at the mouth of Mill Creek in 1913. The road to the Davis Shipyard and the portion of MD 503 north to MD 2 was improved as a wartime access project in around 1944. MD 503 was removed from the state highway system in 1957. MD 760 was assigned in two sections: along Rousby Hall Road from the present southern terminus to Olivet Road in 1962, and from there north to MD 2 in 1963. The state highway was extended north to MD 2 and MD 4 when the two highways were relocated from MD 765 to a new divided highway to the west around 1987; this intersection was changed to a directional crossover intersection in 2005. The roundabout at Olivet Road was constructed in 2006 in conjunction with the fourth leg of the roundabout, Southern Connector Boulevard.

This phenomenon is recognized sufficiently that researchers undertake studies to examine bias in past published studies. Funding bias has been associated, in particular, with research into chemical toxicity, tobacco, and pharmaceutical drugs. It is an instance of experimenter's bias. Causes =Human nature= The psychology text Influence: Science and Practice describes the act of reciprocity as a trait in which a person feels obliged to return favors. This trait is embodied in all human cultures. Human nature may influence even the most ethical researchers to be affected by their sponsors, although they may genuinely deny it. =Misconduct= Scientific malpractice involving shoddy research or data manipulation does occur in rare instances. Often, however, the quality of manufacturers' studies are at least as good as studies that were not funded by a special interest. Therefore, bias usually occurs for other reasons. =Predetermined conclusion= Research results can be selected or discarded to support a predetermined conclusion. The tobacco industry, for example, would publish their own internal research that invariably found minimal adverse health effects of passive smoking. A company that hires researchers to perform a study may require the researchers to sign a nondisclosure agreement before they are funded, by which researchers waive their right to release any results independently and release them only to the sponsor. The sponsor may fund several studies at the same time, suppressing results found contrary to their business interests while publicizing the results that support their interests. Indeed, a review of pharmaceutical studies revealed that research funded by drug companies was less likely to be published, but the drug-company-funded research that was published was more likely to report outcomes favorable to the sponsor. A double-blind study with only objective measures is less likely to be biased to support a given conclusion. However, the researchers or the sponsors still have opportunities to skew the results by discarding or ignoring undesirable data, qualitatively characterizing the results, and ultimately deciding whether to publish at all. Also, not all studies are possible to conduct double-blind. =Publication bias= Scientist researcher Anders Sandberg writes that funding bias may be a form of publication bias. Because it is easier to publish positive results than inconclusive or no results, positive results may be correlated with being positive for the sponsor. Outcome reporting bias is related to publication bias and selection bias, in which multiple outcomes are measured but only the significant outcomes are reported, while insignificant or unfavorable outcomes are ignored. =Selection of subjects or comparators= Selection bias may result in a non-representative population of test subjects in spite of best efforts to obtain a representative sample. Even a double-blind study may be subject to biased selection of dependent variables, population (via inclusion and exclusion criteria), sample size, statistical methods, or inappropriate comparators, any of which can bias the outcome of a study to favor a particular conclusion. Examples *A 1996 study on the effects of nicotine on cognitive performance revealed that findings of nicotine or smoking improving performance were more likely to be published by scientists who acknowledged tobacco industry support. *A 2003 study of published research on antidepressants found that studies sponsored by manufacturers of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and newer antidepressants tended to favor their products over alternatives when compared to non-industry-funded studies. Also, modelling studies funded by industry were more favorable to industry than studies funded by non-industry sponsors. In general, studies funded by drug companies are four times more likely to favor the drug under trial than studies funded by other sponsors. *A 2006 review of experimental studies examining the health effects of cell phone use found that studies funded exclusively by industry were least likely to report a statistically significant result. *The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined in 2008 that the bisphenol A (BPA) in plastic containers is safe when leeched into food, citing chemical industry studies. Independent research studies reached different conclusions, with over 90 percent of them finding health effects from low doses of BPA. *Two opposing commercial sponsors can be at odds with the published findings of research they sponsor. A 2008 Duke University study on rats, funded by the Sugar Association, found adverse effects of consuming the artificial sweetener Splenda. The manufacturer, Johnson & Johnson subsidiary McNeil Nutritionals LLC, responded by sponsoring its own team of experts to refute the study. * In 2016, an analysis of studies exploring health effects of sugary soda consumption published between 2001 and 2016 found a 100% probability that a study was funded by sugar-sweetened beverage companies if it found no link between sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and poorer metabolic health. Only 2.9% of studies that found sugary beverages linked to higher rates of diabetes and obesity were underwritten by the sugar-sweetened beverage industry (see also sugar marketing). The authors concluded \\"This industry seems to be manipulating contemporary scientific processes to create controversy and advance their business interests at the expense of the public's health.‚Äù * A 2017 Cochrane review analysis of outcomes of studies pertaining to drugs and medical devices revealed that manufacturing company sponsorship \\"leads to more favorable results and conclusions than sponsorship by other sources.\\" See also * Advocacy group * Conflict of interest * Conflicts of interest in academic publishing * Metascience * Regulatory capture References External links * * Category:Academic publishing Category:Bias Category:Conflict of interest Category:Criticism of science Category:Research ethics Category:Science studies Category:Systematic review ","title":"Funding bias"},{"id":"28248200","text":"Mezzo Cammin is a semiannual online literary journal devoted to formalist poetry by contemporary women as well as to bring attention back to work that was more famous in previous eras.

There are two possible origins for this term: the epic of Jason and the Argonauts, where Pelasgian women killed their men, and that of Herodotus narrative where the Pelasgians killed captive mothers and children. As is usual in other nationalistic epics as well, other people and tribes are deemed to have barbaric tendencies. Besides, Pelasgians of Lemnos spoke pre-Greek Lemnian, and were technologically inferior (as can be seen from the weapons found in burials), which further promoted their primitive nature.  Jasonian origin  It is said that Pelasgian women decided to kill their men, due to the men's cheating with the mainland Thracian women. In anger, the women slaughtered the men in their sleep and lived without men for many years, until Jason and the Argonauts arrived during The Quest for the Golden Fleece. They mingled with the women and created a new race: the Minyae.

An early supporter of Sun Yat-sen and member of the Tongmenghui, as well as a later participant in the Nanchang Uprising and the Long March, Lin came to be seen as one of the elder statesmen of the Communist Party of China. On October 1, 1949, Lin presided over the Communist Party's victory ceremony in Tiananmen Square, and stood on the right-hand side of Mao Zedong as he proclaimed the foundation of the People's Republic of China.n.n. Life of Lin Boqu Lin Boqu Museum  Biography  Lin Boqu, born Lin Zuhan (ÊûóÁ•ñÊ∂µ), was raised in a rural family in a village near Changde, Hunan, and received a state grant to study in Tokyo at the age of 16. There, he joined the Tongmenghui, the revolutionary group founded by Sun Yat-sen. After returning to China, Lin worked as a school teacher, before he was recruited to the Dongbei region for revolutionary work on behalf of the Tongmenghui. After the fall of the Qing dynasty, Lin found himself persecuted by the Yuan Shikai regime, and was forced to escape to Japan, where he joined Sun Yat-sen's newly formed Chinese Revolutionary Party (later to become the Kuomintang). Returning to China again, he joined the Communist Party in 1921.Mao's road to power: revolutionary writings 1912-1949, p. 192 Throughout the first half of the 1920s, Lin continued working with the Kuomintang in different capacities, most significantly as Minister of Agriculture. Eventually shifting his allegiances to the communists, he took part in the Nanchang Uprising in 1927. Shortly afterwards, he left China for a six-year stay in the Soviet Union, where he studied at the Moscow Sun Yat-sen University. He returned in late 1933, and became active in the Jiangxi Soviet, serving as Minister of Finance and presiding over the Council of Agriculture. After taking part in the Long March, he resumed his duties as Minister of Finance from Yan'an and was also elected Chairman of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. In this period, Lin came to be known as one of the Five Elders of Yan'an (), along with Dong Biwu, Xu Teli, Wu Yuzhang, and Xie Juezai. Due to his seniority and early allegiance to Sun Yat-sen, Lin was often drawn upon as a resource for diplomatic needs with the Kuomintang. In 1936, he assisted Zhou Enlai in the negotiations with Chiang Kai-shek during the Xi'an Incident, and in the alliance that followed generally helped to facilitate the United Front against the Japanese.Bartke, Wolfgang. Who was Who in the People's Republic of China. Vol 1. Munich: K.G. Saur, 1997. p. 267 In February 1944, Lin traveled to Chongqing for negotiations with the Nationalist government, and in April 1949, he was again paired with Zhou Enlai for peace talks with Kuomintang general Zhang Zhizhong in Beijing.Jianli, Huang. \\"The Kuomintang Peace Mission on the Eve of the Communist Takeover.\\" Power and Identity in the Chinese World Order: Festschrift in Honour of Professor Wang Gungwu. Ed. Billy K.L. So, John Fitzgerald, Huang Jianli, James K. Chin. Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, 2003. As the preparations for the formation of the People's Republic of China were underway in the latter half of 1949, Lin was appointed Secretary General of the Central People's Government Committee. In that role, he presided over the founding ceremony of the new nation on October 1, 1949 - sometimes referred to as the \\"host\\" of the celebrations. After the foundation of the PRC, Lin took up a variety of positions, though preferred to stay out of the political limelight. In September 1954, he was elected Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. In the years that followed, he undertook lengthy inspection tours of primarily rural provinces, beginning with his native Hunan and continuing to Guangxi, Jiangxi, Hubei, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Ningxia. Lin died in a Beijing hospital on May 26, 1960. In a memorial poem, Marshal Chen Yi eulogized him as \\"a hero always upholding the correct line in his glorious revolutionary career.\\"Translations from Red Flag, Vol. 1-6. Joint Publications Research Service: University of Michigan, 1986. p. 219. Lin's fellow \\"Yan'an Elder\\" Dong Biwu memorialized his friend in two poems following his passing, focusing more on the personal than the political.http://www.lbqgjjq.com/news/info/79?type=58 Deng Xiaoping gave the following tribute, highlighting the breadth of Lin's experience as well as the depth of his contribution: \\"He [went] through three historical stages: the old democratic revolution led by the bourgeoisie, the new democratic revolution led by the proletariat, and the socialist revolution. In every stage of the revolution, he was a complete revolutionary and made an indelible contribution to the liberation of the Chinese people.\\"http://www.lbqgjjq.com/news/info/78?type=58 Lin is buried at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery in Beijing, along with other first-generation CCP leaders such as Zhu De, Ren Bishi, Peng Dehuai, and Chen Yun.  Posthumous purge  Lin was posthumously purged during the Cultural Revolution for allegedly opposing the marriage between Mao and Jiang Qing during the Yan'an years. As a result, he was removed from his iconic spot in the official portrait of the 1949 foundation ceremony, like Gao Gang and Liu Shaoqi before him. He was not restored to the painting until 1979.  Family and personal life  Lin was married four times and had eight children. His oldest son, Lin Yongsan (ÊûóÁî®‰∏â), was elected to the Eleventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in 2008, and has served in a variety of government posts. Lin's daughter Lin Li studied with Zhou Enlai's adopted daughter Sun Weishi in Moscow, and was later imprisoned for seven years during the Cultural Revolution for supposed associations with Li Lisan. According to his niece, Lin was a personal friend of Sun Yat-sen, and was with Dr. Sun when he died.Ching Tsao, Christina. Shanghai Bride: Her Tumultuous Life's Journey to the West. Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, 2005. p. 50.  Poetry  Lin was an avid poet, composing prolifically throughout his life. According to the curator of his museum, he wrote over a thousand poems. His work has been published in Chinese as Lin Boqu Collection and Selected Poems of Lin Boqu. His poem \\"The Dream of Going Back Home\\" can be found prominently inscribed on the two-mile long Poetry Wall in his hometown of Changde, listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the longest wall with engraved arts in the world.

The two conversed frequently and shared many views and opinions on various social, polictical, and linguistic issues. Like Fj√∏rtoft, he wrote extensively about dialect. In 1892, he helped Molkte Moe in writing Nordahl Rolfsen's reading book. He helped Moe with spelling and styling in the nynorsk edition of the reading book. The work he did on this book fit very well with Flo's own natural sense of style, and he translated many skaldic poems into nynorsk for the book. Flo was also responsible for a great deal of the work in volumes two and three of Austild's reading books. Flo wrote frequently in various journals and magazines, mostly concerning language issues, as well as about related social issues. In 1899, he was included in the first official orthography committee for the national idiom, which focused on spelling in Nynorsk. He was the first editor of the magazine Syn og Segn. He also served as director of Det Norske Samlaget from 1894-1903.

The concept of the Spark Suit is to convert the movements of the wearer into electricity using nano-ion pumps. This technology has a possible application in a hypothetical vehicle called the Nike ONE. Due to the extra resistance caused by the electrical generator, the Spark Suit can be used to strategically impede movement.

Also with the Trans-Caspian railway, Russia could transport troops from Central Asia much faster. The railway operated as a private company between 1865‚Äì1922 and a subsidiary railway of the Soviet Railways from 1922‚Äì1991. History =Russian Empire (1865-1917)= 5 bonds of the Transcaucasian Railway- Company, issued 23. April 1882 The railway in 1916 The railway started in 1865 at the port town of Poti on the Black Sea. The railway reached Zestafoni in 1871 and T'bilisi in 1872. The contractor for this part of the line was Messrs G.B. Crawley and Co.; the resident engineer was Edward Preston, C.E. who had previously been at work in North Wales.Japan Railway and Transport Review, 24, July 2000, p.42. This may account for the interest shown by this railway in Welsh mountain railways and narrow-gauge steam locomotives running on the north Wales Festiniog Railway.J.I.C. Boyd, The Festiniog Railway, Vol.1 (Oakwood, 1975), pp.105,109 A branch line was built to Kutaisi, branching from Brotseula, in 1877. In 1883 the railway was completed to Baku. Once the railway was completed to Baku, freight trains carrying oil went from Baku to Poti to be shipped to other cities in Russia via the Black Sea. During the Russian-Ottoman war from 1877‚Äì1878, the Russian Empire gained territory into Anatolia from the Ottoman Empire after defeating them during the Battle of Kars. This new territory included the fortress city of Kars. In 1887 a branch line was built to Tkibuli. In 1894 a branch line, splitting of at Khashuri, was built to Borjomi. Kars was a strategic city for the Russians in Anatolia, so in 1899 the railway built a branch line from T'blisi to Kars. The Transcaucasus Railway was connected to the rest of the Russian system in 1900, when the line from Baku to Makhachkala was completed. In 1902, a narrow gauge railway from Borjomi to Bakuriani was built to serve the skiing community in the region. In 1913 the railway was extended from Kars to Sarƒ±kamƒ±≈ü; the border of the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire at the time. When World War I broke out in 1914, the Russian Empire sided with the Allied powers while the Ottoman Empire sided with the Central Powers making the two empires enemies. After the Erzerum Offensive, Russia gained control city of Erzurum. To support campaigns further into Ottoman territory, a narrow gauge (750mm) railway was built from Sarƒ±kamƒ±≈ü to Erzurum in 1916 and extended to Yenik√∂y later the same year. Russia had to stop fighting in the war because of the Russian revolution of 1917, that led to the dissolution of the Russian Empire. =Russian Civil War (1918-1922)= With the dissolution of the Russian Empire, a 147 km part of the Julfa-Tabriz line was acquired by the Persian Railways. The Ottoman Empire lost, along with the Central Powers, giving northeastern Anatolia to Armenia. In 1919 the Turkish War of Independence broke out and northeastern Anatolia was taken back by the Turks, this time as the Republic of Turkey. The Treaty of G√ºmr√º was signed on December 2, 1920 setting the present day borders of Turkey. The Transcaucasus Railway continued to operate the 404 km part of its system in Turkey. In 1921 the Erzurum- Yenik√∂y section of the line was abandoned. =Soviet Union (1922-1991)= The Soviet Union was formed in 1922, and the Transcaucasus Railway was absorbed by the Soviet Railways but continued to operate as a subsidiary railway. In 1924 the railway started building a line from Baku, south to Alyat, Shirvan and to the port city of Neftchala. In 1927, the Akyaka-Erzurum (in Turkey) section of its system was acquired by the Turkish State Railways. The railway built a branch line from Gyumri to Maralik in 1925. the railway built a line north to connect with the Soviet Railways at Adler branching off at Senaki, the line was completed to Gali in 1930, Sukhumi in 1938 and Adler in 1949. A branch line to Tkvarcheli was built in 1940. A line from Kutaisi to Tskhaltubo was built in 1935 along with a branch to Tskhinvali in 1940. In 1941 the railway built two lines: one from Shirvan to Julfa and one from Salyan to Astara on the Azerbaijan-Iran border, thus connecting with the Iranian system. A line was built to the port city of Batumi was later built in the 1960s. =Dissolution of the Railway (1991)= After the dissolution of the Soviet Union the railway was divided among the new countries that were formed. Jalama-Makhachkala part of the Baku-Makhachkala line was acquired by the Russian Railways. The tracks in Georgia were acquired by the Georgian Railways LLC, although the tracks in Abkhazia were taken over by the Abkhazian railway (this company was later absorbed by the Georgian railways). The tracks in Azerbaijan and Nakhchivan were taken over by the Azerbaijan State Railway and the tracks in Armenia were taken over by the Armenian Railway. The railway line in Abkhazia was acquired by Abkhazian Railway and in 2009 ‚Äî Russian Railways. The railway Tbilisi-Baku (in Georgia and Azerbaijan) is being renovated during 2008‚Äì2014, together with a new railway built between Turkey and Tbilisi, Georgia. This is the Kars‚ÄìTbilisi‚ÄìBaku railway. There is a closed railway Tbilisi-Armenia-Turkey but Armenia will be bypassed by this project.

Electricity theft is the criminal practice of stealing electrical power. It is a crime and is punishable by fines and/or incarceration. It belongs to the non-technical losses. According to the annual Emerging Markets Smart Grid: Outlook 2015 study by the Northeast Group, LLC, the world loses US$89.3 billion annually to electricity theft. The highest losses were in India ($16.2 billion), followed by Brazil ($10.5 billion) and Russia ($5.1 billion). President of Northeast Group Ben Gardner stated : \\"India loses more money to theft than any other country in the world. The state of Maharashtra‚Äîwhich includes Mumbai‚Äîalone loses $2.8 billion per year, more than all but eight countries in the world. Nationally, total transmission and distribution losses approach 23% and some states' losses exceed 50%.\\"  Types  There are various types of electrical power theft, including Tapping a line or bypassing the energy meter. According to a study , 80% of worldwide theft occurs in private dwellings and 20% on commercial and industrial premises. The various types of electrical power theft include: = Direct hooking from line = What's known as \\"cable hooking\\" is the most used method. 80% of global power theft is by direct tapping from the line. The consumer taps into a power line from a point ahead of the energy meter. This energy consumption is unmeasured and procured with or without switches. = Bypassing the energy meter = In this method, the input terminal and output terminal of the energy meter is bridged, preventing the energy from registering in the energy meter. = Injecting foreign element in the energy meter = Meters are manipulated via a remote by installing a circuit inside the meter so that the meter can be slowed down at any time. This kind of modification can evade external inspection attempts because the meter is always correct unless the remote is turned on. = Physical obstruction = This type of tampering is done to electromechanical meters with a rotating element. Foreign material is placed inside the meter to obstruct the free movement of the disc. A slower rotating disk signals less energy consumption. = ESD attack on electronic meter = This type of tampering is done on electronic meter to make it either latent damage or permanent damage. Detection can be done correctly in high end meters only.  Detection  A number of approaches to detect electricity theft have been proposed. The predominant direction in research and development is employing artificial intelligence, and in particular machine learning methods, to detect customers that steal electricity.  In popular culture  Katiyabaaz (Powerless), a 2014 Indian documentary film, dealt with issue of power theft in the city of Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh.  History  On March 27, 1886 it was reported that electricity espionage was accomplished by unscrupulous persons tapping into Edison Electricity in New York. The Superintendent of the power station sent a power surge into the line to burn out or destroy foreign objects trespassing on the line.

LiveShare Plus - MS WindowsThe team was also assisted initially by MIT Professor Michael Dertouzos and two of his grad students Greg Papadopoulos and Richard Soley. While at MIT Hinman and Bernstein were motivated by the video compression work by UC Davis Professor Anil K. Jain (1946‚Äì1988) and his colleague Jaswani R. Jain who published an important research paperDisplacement Measurement and Its Application in Interframe Image Coding, December 1981 combining block-based motion compensation and transform coding in December 1981. The result was PictureTel, creating one of the first real- time systemsHistory of PictureTel Corp. ‚Äì FundingUniverse to implement motion compensation and transform coding in July 1986. PictureTel was funded as \\"PicTel\\" by an initial public offering in November 1984, becoming a public company on virtually its first day of business. Product development started at this point. Its name was changed to PictureTel in 1987 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/755095/0000950135-96-001824.txt, due to concern about potential name conflict with another communications company, Pacific Telephone Co., also known as PacTel. While the company demonstrated its first product in 1986, the company did not have meaningful product sales until 1987. PictureTel's first product, the C-2000 codec (compressor/decompressor) was the first commercial implementation of this computationally intensive technology. By analyzing the motion between successive frames rather than treating the frames as a sequence of unrelated images, this algorithm was significantly more data-efficient (required the transmission of much less data) than existing techniques. Requiring less data also meant that it was compatible with emerging dial-up data networks such as ISDN, making its use less expensive and more flexible than the leased, fixed- location lines normally used for high-speed data transmission at the time. Subsequently, most of the video compression standards for two-way communications and video broadcast applications have been based upon motion compensation and transform coding, including those most widely used today such as H.264/MPEG-4 AVC. PictureTel played a strong role in developing the industry standards for video, audio, and data communications, and released much of its technology for use free of charge. In October 2001, PictureTel was purchased by Polycom, a company that was co-founded in 1990 by Brian Hinman and another early PictureTel employee, Jeffrey Rodman.

Bracker, 448 U.S. 136 (1980), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States holding that Arizona's taxes that were assessed against a non-Indian contractor that was working exclusively for an Indian tribe on that tribe's reservation were preempted by federal law.. Background Map showing the Fort Apache Indian Reservation (in red - upper half) =History= The Fort Apache Timber Company (FATCO) is a tribal enterprise created by the White Mountain Apache tribe contracted with the Pinetop Logging Company (Pinetop) in 1969 to transport and sell lumber harvested by FATCO on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation. The lumber itself is harvested from land held in trust by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) for the benefit of the tribe. The BIA has a contract with FATCO to harvest the trees, but the BIA controlled which trees would be taken, the equipment to be used, where and what roads would be used and logging truck speeds. Pinetop vehicles do not leave the reservation, and only used roads built and maintained by BIA. In 1971, the Arizona Highway Department (now the Arizona Department of Transportation) sought to collect a motor carrier tax and a fuel tax from Pinetop. Pinetop paid under protest, and both Pinetop and the tribe sued to recover the taxes. =Lower courts= The Superior Court of Maricopa County, Arizona, granted a summary judgment to the state and both the tribe and Pinetop appealed. At the Arizona Court of Appeals, Pinetop argued that McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Comm'n. prohibited the taxes that Arizona sought. The state argued that Pinetop was not part of the tribe and were not owned by Indians, and therefore the tax applied. The appellate court affirmed the decision of the trial court. Both the tribe and Pinetop appealed, but the Arizona Supreme Court declined to review the decision. The United States Supreme Court then granted certiorari to hear the case. Opinion of the Court Justice Thurgood Marshall delivered the opinion of the court. Marshall held that when a state seeks to assert authority over activities on a reservation by a non-Indian, that the court must look at the nature of the state, federal and tribal interests that are at stake. Here, the federal government, through the BIA, extensively regulated and controlled the timber operation and are so pervasive as to preclude any state taxation of the non- Indian contractor. The decision of the Arizona Court of Appeals was reversed. =Concurrence= Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., concurred with the majority. The fact that the roads that Pinetop used were BIA or tribal roads would mean that the state was taxing for revenue that would not be needed to maintain the roads being used, and that this amounted to double taxation. =Dissent= Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by Justices Potter Stewart and William Rehnquist, dissented. Stevens believed that the state could tax Pinetop, and that it was not relevant as to whether those taxes were passed on to the tribe. He would have affirmed the decision.

Born in Hungary, he immigrated to the United States in the early 1920s. A soccer player in Budapest, after immigrating to the U.S. with his family as a teen, he joined the Labor Sports Union in New York. From there, he got involved with other Workers' organizations. In 1925, after mainstream media photographers were beaten during the Passaic Textile Strike in Passaic, New Jersey, he took up a camera to document the strike and the brutality of police toward the strikers. He became a \\"worker filmmaker\\" who helped to make the film, Passaic Textile Strike, one of the earliest surviving films about workers' struggles in the United States. In 1926, at the age of 21, and one year from an engineering degree, Balog left Cooper Union in New York City to join the workers' movement. He designed banners and posters for political events, and continued to photograph and document the struggles of his era. He became a projectionist and showed \\"workers' films\\" to groups in theatres, union halls, community centers and other alternative settings. In 1930, he and others in New York City took the name Film & Photo League.Campbell, Russell. Cinema Strikes Back: Radical Filmmaking in the United States 1930‚Äì1942. Ann Arbor: UMI Research Press, 1982 In 1933, he left New York on a cross country film tour, showing Workers' Newsreels and the Soviet film \\"Mother\\" in over fifty cities. In San Francisco, he was active with the Film and Photo League there, and continued to project films at leftist events in California. He contributed to the only extant film of the San Francisco Film and Photo League, \\"Century of Progress,\\" (1934) which he donated to The Walter P. Reuther Library of Wayne State University in the 1970s. The film featured footage of the 1933 Cotton Strike in Tulare County. Balog also donated other films portraying farm workers from the 1930s and 1960s, as well as a film he produced as a member of the \\"Miscellaneous Workers Union\\" portraying a Labor Day parade and actions in San Francisco, 1941. In 1934, he was arrested in Tulare County, CA and jailed for showing films without a permit of the previous year's strikes to a group of farmworkers. From 1942‚Äì1945, he served in the Army. In the late 1940s, he was a photographer for the ILWU. In the 1950s, he moved to Cambria, CA with his wife and children, and ran a movie theater there. He moved to the Los Angeles area in the 1960s, and became an active member of the UAW. He continued to screen films throughout his life to activist audiences.

It is administered by Ontario Parks, which classifies it as a recreation park. The landscape of the park is the legacy of the retreat of an enormous glacier at the end of the last Ice Age, approximately 12,000 years ago. After the glacier retreated, half-buried icebergs melted to form small, deep lakes referred to by earth scientists as kettle lakes. Twenty of the 22 lakes in Kettle Lakes Provincial Park are kettles. The retreating glacier also left eskers and erratics. The lakes are surrounded by forests made up primarily of jack pine interspersed with balsam fir, red and white pine, and white and black spruce. Stands of deciduous trees such as trembling aspen and white birch may also be found in the park. There are 139 campsites in the park in two campgrounds. The park is also a popular destination for canoeing, swimming at one of several sandy beaches, hiking and fishing.

As a result of the years spent in London and elsewhere in the United Kingdom, his work shows clear influences of Anglo-Saxon culture. He works mainly as a painter and sculptor, with a definite realist style, and he is also known as a portrait painter. Oil Painting is his medium of choice, and his subjects, other than portraits, include the feminine figure, draperies, still-life, symbolic and magic realism, as well as scenes from ordinary life. Amongst his numerous portraits are those of the President of the Portuguese Parliament, Dr. Ant√≥nio Almeida Santos, the Bishops of Oporto D. Armindo Coelho and D. Manuel Clemente and those at the Constitutional Court, Dr Artur Maur√≠cio and Dr Luis Nunes de Almeida. Paintins of his can be seen in several institutions, both public and private and he has exhibited both on his own and collectively, national and internationally. His works are referred to and illustrated in numerous publications, specially those published by Galeria Cordeiros and their associates.

It was a single-engined pusher configuration biplane intended to carry out coastal patrols to protect shipping against German U-boats, but only two were built, the only flying boats to be designed and built by the Royal Aircraft Factory. Design and development In February 1917, Germany restarted unrestricted submarine warfare against Britain, France and their allies, resulting in heavy losses to unescorted merchant shipping. There was a shortage of maritime patrol aircraft as the large Felixstowe F.2 flying boats had not yet entered large scale service, and the Royal Aircraft Factory, despite the fact that most of its aircraft were intended for land service with the Royal Flying Corps, decided to design and build a coastal patrol flying boat, the C.E.1 (Coastal Experimental 1) to help combat the U-boat menace.Hare 1990, p. 193.London 2003, pp. 35‚Äì36. Work started on the C.E.1, designed by William Farren, in July 1917, with two prototypes being built. It was a single-engined pusher, of similar layout to the pre-war Sopwith Bat Boat, but considerably larger, with a wooden hull featuring a single step, and the tail surfaces carried on tailbooms above and behind the hull. The aircraft's two-bay biplane wings folded rearwards for storage. The crew of two sat in tandem open cockpits, with a planned armament of up to three Lewis guns on pillar mountings, while bombs could be carried below the lower wings.Hare 1990, pp. 193‚Äì194.Bruce 1957, pp. 387‚Äì388. The first prototype, powered by a 230 hp (172 kW) RAF 3 V12 engine driving a four-bladed propeller was completed at Farnborough late in 1917, being sent to Hamble near Southampton for final assembly and initial flight testing on 25 December.Bruce 1957, pp. 388‚Äì389. The C.E.1 made its maiden flight, piloted by its designer, on 17 January 1918. After modifications to its controls it was sent to the Port Victoria Marine Experimental Aircraft Depot on the Isle of Grain for service trials in April, being quickly followed by the second prototype, which was powered by a 260 hp (190 kW) Sunbeam Maori engine. Trials showed that the C.E.1 was inferior to the larger and more powerful twin-engine Felixstowe flying boats, and no production followed, the two prototypes being used for hydrodynamic experiments to validate test data obtained from model tests in a test tank at the National Physical Laboratory.Hare 1990, pp. 194‚Äì195.

The company went out of business in 2015. History From the 1850s to the 1950s, America was the predominant manufacturing center for quality and affordable mechanical watches. After WWII, Switzerland advanced its position in the industry ahead of the United States with gauge making experience and machinery which was used for military vehicles. Christopher F. Wardle, originally a native of Michigan and a collector of mechanical timepieces, discovered during his exploits that American watch companies, were all but extinct in the industry. This fact led him to write a business plan in 1994, whereby American innovation could be reintroduced to the watch making industry. In 2001 Wardle sought out an industrial designer to help put his vision and original watch designs to paper. Having been a collector of many American brands and having the desire to keep the models reminiscent of the mid 20th century styles, Wardle started to clinch concepts into designs and after several years of hard work in 2005, introduced the first timepiece, the Smokejumper Chronograph. Incredibly, the Missoula-based National Smokejumper Association (www.smokejumpers.com) endorsed Bozeman Watch Company's Smokejumper Chronograph as the official watch of the wild fire fighter's organization. In 2005, the company opened its first exclusive showroom in Bozeman Montana, USA. In 2008, the company expanded its Michigan design staff and started expanding its ability to create original engineering data, tooling and suppliers to ramp up its model lineup for its expanded showroom plans. In 2010, the Bozeman Watch Company opened another dealer in Whitefish Montana. The Bozeman Watch Company creates data, tooling and original parts for each new watch model. Staying away from standard production parts, the company takes up to 3 years to design and take to market any of its watch models. Where many watch makers buy out of catalogs, BWC uses tiny parts that are made for their company exclusively\\". \\"In 2005 the company opened its first showroom in downtown Bozeman.\\" It has recently expanded their showrooms to Whitefish, Mt and as of July 2011 Jackson Hole, WY.

They spoke the Taovaya dialect of the Wichita language, a Caddoan language. Taovaya people today are enrolled in the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes, a federally recognized tribe headquartered in Anadarko, Oklahoma.  Synonymy  The Taovaya have also been called the Aijado, Tahuayase, Taouaize, Tawehash, Teguayo, Toaya, and Towash.  Culture  Taovaya culture and language was closely related to those of other tribes of the Wichita. They were farmed maize, beans, melons, gourds, and tobacco, and hunted bison. They lived in semi-permanent settlements, except when they lived in temporary hunting camps to follow bison herds. Early history The Taovaya and other Wichita tribes lived in beehive shaped houses thatched with grass and surrounded by fields of maize and other crops. The Taovaya are part of the Wichita tribes, which also include the Tawakoni, Waco (Iscani); and Guichita or Wichita Proper.Susan C. Vehik, \\"Wichita Culture History,\\" Plains Anthropologist 37, no. 131 (1992): p. 311. The Taovaya originated in Kansas, and possibly southern Nebraska. In 1541, Spanish conquistador Francisco V√°squez de Coronado led an expedition across the Great Plains in search of a rich land called Quivira. What he found were ancestral Wichita, a numerous farming and buffalo hunting people in central Kansas who possessed none of the wealth he sought. The furthest part of Quivira is believed to have been located on the Smoky Hill River near Lindsborg, Kansas. This area was called \\"Tabas\\", similar to the name Taovaya.Elizabeth Ann Harper [John], \\"The Taovaya Indians in Frontier Trade and Diplomacy 1719‚Äì1768,\\" Chronicles of Oklahoma, 31, no. 3 (1953): p. 269. From about 1630 to 1710, the Taovaya might have lived near present-day Marion, Kansas, where archaeological sites belonging to the Great Bend aspect have been discovered.Vehik, 328; Roper, Donna C. \\"The Marion Great Bend Aspect Sits: Floodplain Settlement on the Plains.\\" Plains Anthropologist, 47, no. 180 (2002): p. 17‚Äì32.  18th-century history  In 1719, French explorer Claude Charles Du Tisne found two likely Taovaya villages of people he called \\"Paniouassa\\" near the present-day Neodesha, Kansas. \\"Pani\\" was a generic term the French called both Pawnee Indians and Wichita. That same year another French explorer Bernard de la Harpe visited a village, probably a few miles south of Tulsa, Oklahoma, in which the inhabitants were from several Wichita tribes including the \\"Toayas\\" or Taovayas. La Harpe said the Toavayas were said to be the most numerous of the Wichita.Anna Lewis, \\"La Harpe's First Expedition in Oklahoma,\\" Chronicles of Oklahoma, 2, no.4 (December 1924): p. 344. By the 18th century, the Osage encroached upon Wichita lands from the east, and the Apache from the west. In their Kansas and Oklahoma homelands, the Wichita were under intense pressure from both Osage and Apache. In the 1720s the Taovayas and their Guichita relatives began to move south to the Red River establishing a large village on the north side of the river in Jefferson County, Oklahoma, and on the south side at Spanish Fort, Texas. By the late 1750s, many of the Wichita tribes were living in Texas or across the Red River in Oklahoma. The Taovaya were allied with the French, and in 1746 the French brokered a peace between the Taovaya and other Wichita with the Comanche. The Taovaya achieved their maximum influence during the next few decades. The village at Spanish Fort was \\"a lively emporium where Comanches brought Apache slaves, horses and mules to trade for French packs of powder, balls, knives, and textiles and for Taovayas-grown maize, melons, pumpkins, squash, and tobacco.\\"Earl Henry Elam, \\"Anglo-American Relations with the Wichita Indians in Texas, 1822‚Äì1859,\\" Master's Thesis, Texas Technological College, 1967, p. 11. The attack on San Sab√° mission is depicted in the earliest extant painting of an event in Texas history.Sam D. Ratcliffe, \\"'Escenas de Maritiro': Notes on the Destruction of Mission San Sab√°\\", The Southwestern Historical Quarterly, 94, no. 4 (April 1991): pp. 507‚Äì34. As French allies, the Taovaya ran afoul of the Spanish who had several posts and missions in southern Texas. In 1758, the Comanche, Taovaya, and other Wichita destroyed the San Sab√° de la Santa Cruz mission of the Spanish. The next year the Spanish sent a 500-man army north to attack the Taovaya village at Spanish Fort, Texas. An Indian army met the Spaniards and routed them, capturing two cannons and killing or wounding about 50 of the Spaniards.Elizabeth A. H. John, Storms Brewed in Other Men's Worlds (College Station: Texas A&M; University Press, 1975), p. 32. The unsuccessful Spanish attack on Taovaya villages in Texas and Oklahoma in 1759 is known as the Battle of the Twin Villages. The Taovaya continued to wage war against the Spanish and their Lipan Apache allies while also in the 1760s acting peacefully towards the Spanish missions among the Hasinai, a Caddo tribe. In December 1764 Eyasiquiche, one of the prominent leaders among the Taovaya, led an attack against Spaniards and Apaches near Mission San Lorenzo de la Santa Cruz. In this attack a Spanish soldier, Antonio Trevino, was taken prisoner by the Taovoya. Originally Eyasiquiche planned to adopt Trevino into the Taovaya people, but, on learning he was from Los Adaes, Esquiche decided to return Trevino there.Juliana Barr, Peace Came in the Form of a Woman: Indians and Spaniards in the Texas Borderlands (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina, 2007), p. 197-99. The French loss of their American colonies in 1763 in the French and Indian War interrupted the flow of trade goods to the Taovayas and made them more receptive to the Spanish. This process took years because the French traders remained in Louisiana, and it was not until Alejandro O'Reilly became governor that regulations were enacted that forbade French trading with the Taovaya. In 1771 the Taovayas, the other Wichita, and the Tonkawa made a peace agreement with the Spanish, defying the Comanche. The Taovaya trading empire was diminished by the Comanche and an epidemic, probably smallpox, that struck the Wichita in 1777 and 1778, killing more than 300 of them.Pekka Haalainen, The Comanche Empire (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2008), p. 96-97; Earl Henry Elam, \\"Anglo-American Relations with the Wichita Indians in Texas, 1822‚Äì1839,\\" , 18. In 1778, the Taovaya village at Spanish Fort had 123 houses and across the Red River a Wichita town had another 37 houses. Together the two towns counted 600 men and a total population of probably around 2,500., 17. This however, was far less than the Wichita population in the time of Coronado when they numbered several tens of thousands. In 1801 another epidemic killed a great number of them. The American Indian agent Dr. John Sibley estimated in 1805 that they numbered 400 men., 19  19th-century history  The Taovaya as a distinct tribe ended rather suddenly. In 1811, their chief, Awahakei, died during a visit to Americans in Natchitoches, Louisiana. The tribe did not select another leader and fragmented. Some joined the Tawakoni on the Brazos River. The Americans came to collectively call them \\"Wichita.\\", pp. 19-20. In 1835, the Taovaya signed a treaty with the Americans and were relocated from Texas to an Indian reservation in southwest Indian Territory.

The church is located in Iowa City, Iowa, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. History Trinity Church traces its roots to the missionary activities of the Rt. Rev. Jackson Kemper, Missionary Bishop of the Northwest, who first visited the area on July 10, 1841. He continued his visits until the parish was formed on August 7, 1853. The first rector of the church, the Rev. Willis H. Barris, came to Trinity on October 15, 1855. The Rev. Silas Totten who was rector from 1859 to 1862 served as the second President of the University of Iowa at the same time. with The parish had no regular meeting place until 1862 when it purchased the Athenaeum. That building was used for church purposes until the present church was completed on October 1, 1871. The Athenaeum building was later sold to St. Patrick's Catholic Church when it was established in 1873. The present church building was built on property purchased from Samuel and Sarah Ballard in 1868. The design for the church is attributed to Richard Upjohn. It is not known if the plans came directly from Upjohn, or if they were from drawings found in his Rural Architecture. There is also some evidence that it resembles a drawing by Bishop Randall of Colorado that was published in The Spirit of Missions in May 1867. The church is a wood structure in the Gothic Revival style. It is considered significant as the only Gothic Revival building in Iowa City that utilizes vertical boarding that is often used in this form of the style. While the sanctuary remains similar to the day it was built, additions for educational facilities and a parish hall have been added over the years.

The initial version launched on December 24, 2009.  Gameplay  Trenches is a combination of a Castle Attack and Tower Defense set during World War I. The player is put into the role of a Battlefield Commander for the British Expeditionary Forces in Western Europe during 1914 against the German Army, or vice versa, and the player must accomplish a set of missions to complete the game during the campaign. The game spans throughout the war as the game progresses, allowing the play to unlock more classes and artillery. The player must allocate resources and hire units to combat enemies units advancing from the right side of the screen. Units include the Riflemen, Machinegunner, Sniper, Engineer, Mortar Team, and randomly spawned Officers that add aura-based benefits to allied units. Players also have access to off-screen artillery support that include High Explosive Bombardment and Poisonous Gas. The game includes a variety of skirmish modes that includes King of the Trench (King of the Hill) and a Zombie Horde mode, with a subsequent updated adding cooperative and competitive multiplayer.  Reception  Trenches released with a wide range of ratings and response and was featured by Apple under \\"Hot New Games\\", \\"Most Addicting Games\\", \\"Best Strategy Games\\", and \\"Made for iOS4\\". Trenches earned PocketGamer's Bronze Award. = Press = Kotaku praised the game after it was patched. Trenches received a 3 out of 4 from Slide to Play with reviews stating that it was \\"an addictive trench-filled WWI strategy game that shares a few aspects with the war itself.\\" MTV stated that Trenches was an impressive and tight iPhone experience.press review The title received some negative criticisms at its launch due to a simplified gaming experience. TouchArcade stated that the game can be completed by overwhelming the enemy with basic units and contained a very short campaign. Thunder Game Works publicly acknowledge this and released a substantial update to add new skirmish modes, multiplayer, and an extended campaign.  Updates  Thunder Game Works has later announced a standalone spin-off version of its popular Zombie Horde skirmish mode, Stenches, which expanded on the Zombie Horde mode's features and gameplay.

Thus, language is viewed as a \\"conduit\\" conveying mental content between people. Defined and described by linguist Michael J.

The overwhelming majority of what he calls core expressions involved dead metaphors selected from speakers' internal thoughts and feelings. Speakers then \\"put these thoughts into words\\" and listeners \\"take them out of the words.\\" Since words are actually marks or sounds and do not literally have \\"insides,\\" people talk about language largely in terms of metaphors. Most English core expressions used in talking about communication assert that actual thoughts and feelings pass back and forth between people through the conduit of words. These core expressions and the few that do not qualify as conduit metaphors are listed in the paper's extensive appendix,Reddy 1979, pp. 311‚Äì324 which itself has been cited by Andrew Ortony as \\"a major piece of work, providing linguistics with an unusual corpus, as well as substantiating Reddy's claims about the pervasiveness of the root metaphor.\\"Ortony, A. (1992). Metaphor, language, and thought. In A. Ortony (Ed.), Metaphor and Thought (2nd ed.) (p. 6). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. hardback; paperback =Major framework= There are two distinct but similar frameworks in which the conduit metaphor appears. Four types of core expressions constitute the major framework. (In the following example sentences, the operative core expressions are italicized.) Language is a conduit These commonplace examples‚Äî #You can't get your concept across to the class that way #His feelings came through to her only vaguely #They never give us any idea of what they expect ‚Äîare understood metaphorically. In 1., people do not actually \\"get across\\" concepts by talking; in 2., feelings do not really \\"come through to\\" people; and in 3., people do not in fact \\"give\\" to others their ideas, which are mental states. Listeners assemble from their own mental states a partial replica of the speakers'. These core expressions assert figuratively that language literally transfers people's mental contents to others.Reddy 1979, pp. 286‚Äì287 Speakers insert thoughts into words These examples‚Äî #Practice capturing your feelings in complete sentences #I need to put each idea into phrases with care #Insert that thought further down in the paragraph #She forced her meanings into the wrong lyrics #Please pack more sensation into fewer stanzas #He loads an argument with more viewpoints than it can withstand ‚Äîshow that in 1., the speaker might be inexperienced in ensnaring meaning; in 2., be clumsy when putting it in; in 3., put it in the wrong place; in 4., compel words to accommodate meanings for which there is not enough room; in 5., fail to put in enough; or in 6., put in too much. These core expressions assert that speakers \\"insert\\" mental content into the \\"containers\\" represented by words with varying degrees of success.Reddy 1979, pp. 287‚Äì288 Words contain thoughts These examples indicate that sounds and marks can be \\"containers\\" for mental content: #The sense of loneliness is in just about every sentence #His story was pregnant with meaning #The entire paragraph was full of emotion #These lines indeed rhyme, but they are devoid of feeling #Your words are hollow‚Äîyou don't mean them. These core expressions assert that words contain or do not contain mental content, depending on the success or failure of the insertion process.Reddy 1979, p. 288 Listeners extract thoughts from words These examples‚Äî #I couldn't actually extract coherent ideas from that prose. #You found some challenging concepts in the essay #They wouldn't really get any hatred out of those statements #Her remark is truly impenetrable #The author's intentions are going to be locked up in that dense chapter forever #Hiding the meaning in his sentences is just his style. #They're reading things into the poem ‚Äîindicate that speakers and writers are responsible to a large extent for the mental content conveyed by language, and that listeners and readers play a more passive role. However, in 7., a reader can add something to the container that was not originally there. Overall, these core expressions assert that listeners must \\"extract\\" mental content from words.Reddy 1979, pp.288‚Äì289 =Minor framework= Instead of words, an \\"idea space\\" between people's heads can be the container for mental content. The conduit is no longer a sealed pipeline between people, but an open pipe allowing mental content to escape into, or enter from, this space. Three types of core expressions constitute the minor framework of the conduit metaphor. Speakers eject thoughts into idea space These examples‚Äî #She poured out the sorrow she'd been holding back #He finally got those ideas out there ‚Äîshow that speakers and writers can eject mental content into an external idea space outside people.Reddy 1979, p. 291 Idea space contains thoughts These examples‚Äî #That theory has been floating around for a century #His crazy notions made their way immediately into cyberspace #Those opinions are on the streets of Brooklyn, not in a classroom ‚Äîindicate that mental content has a material existence in an idea space, existing outside people.Reddy 1979, p. 291 Listeners extract thoughts from idea space The following examples‚Äî #I had to absorb Einstein's ideas gradually #His deepest emotions went right over her head #We couldn't get all that stuff into our brains in one afternoon ‚Äîdemonstrate that mental content from an idea space may or may not re-enter people.Reddy 1979, pp. 291‚Äì292 =Logical apparatus= The italicized words in the above examples are interchangeable with a wide array of terms that label mental content, the containers in which the content may be placed, and the ways in which these containers may be transferred in the conduit-metaphor paradigm. Reddy developed a logical apparatus for diagramming the conduit metaphor's many permutations in both frameworks. Mental contents (feelings, emotions, ideas, etc.) are represented by RM, which stands for \\"mental repertoire.\\" Containers (words, phrases, sentences, etc.) are represented by S, which stands for \\"signal.\\" Thus, \\"I need to put each idea into phrases with care\\" can be rendered as the core expression put RM into S.Reddy 1979, pp. 289‚Äì290 Reddy uses this logical apparatus throughout the appendix to his paper to clarify distinctions between metalingual expressions that use the conduit metaphor and the minority that do not.Reddy 1979, pp. 311‚Äì324 =The toolmakers paradigm= In order to examine the effects of the objectification of mental content in communication using the conduit metaphor, Reddy proposes an alternate, contrasting, \\"radical subjectivist\\" conception of communication called the toolmakers paradigm.Reddy 1979, pp. 292‚Äì295 right A person's mental content is in fact isolated from others'. This isolation can be represented by a wheel-shaped compound, each wedge-shaped sector of which is an environment (a brain) bounded by two spokes and part of the circumference (right). They all contain differing amounts and types of plants, rocks, water, etc. (repertoire members). The wheel's hub has machinery that can deliver sheets of paper between sectors (communication). People use it to exchange crude blueprints (signals) for making tools, shelters, foods, etc., but they have no other contact whatsoever, and know of others' existence by inferences based on these blueprints.Reddy 1979, pp. 292‚Äì293 Living in a forested sector, Alex builds a wooden rake, draws three identical blueprints, and drops them in the slots for Bob, Curt and Don. Bob finds a piece of wood for the handle, but because he lives in a rocky sector, starts making a stone rake head. (Alex had not considered wood to be unavailable or wrong for the rake head, so it was not specified.) When halfway done, Bob connects his stone head to the handle, realizes it will be heavy, and decides it must be a device for digging up rocks when clearing a field for planting. (He infers that Alex must be either very strong or has only small rocks in his sector.) Bob decides two large prongs will make his tool lighter, thus finishing with a two-bladed pickax. He makes three identical blueprints for his pickax and drops them in the slots for Alex, Curt and Don. Alex assembles a kind of rock-pick, but must modify the design if a wooden, two-pronged head is to be strong enough. (He cannot see much use for the tool in his largely rock-free sector, sensing that Bob has misunderstood his rake.) Alex draws a second blueprint for the rake head and sends it out as before. Curt crafts a hoe for slicing cleanly through roots to clear out a swamp. Don creates a gaff for fishing.Reddy 1979, pp. 293‚Äì295 Blueprint users (language users) in the toolmakers paradigm can converge by inference on accurate replications of others' tools (mental content) after a laborious series of exchanges. Using the same diagram for the conduit-metaphor paradigm instead, the hub is a duplicator that can transfer actual materials and constructions among sectors, ending the isolation. No guesswork or construction is needed: Alex puts the rake in a special chamber, pushes a button, and precise replicas appear instantly in similar chambers for Bob, Curt and Don. The subjectivist toolmakers paradigm embodies a language requiring real effort to overcome failures in communication, whereas the objectivist conduit-metaphor paradigm embodies one in which very little effort is needed for success.Reddy 1979, p. 295 =Core expressions are pervasive and unavoidable= Although the toolmakers paradigm is available as a more accurate model of communication, the conduit metaphor is pervasive and difficult to avoid in English syntax and semantics. Thinking in terms of another model of communication is generally brief, isolated and fragmentary because of an entrenched system of opposing attitudes and assumptions.Reddy 1979, p. 297 Pervasive Reddy's tally of core expressions is about 140. Examining alternative ways of speaking about communication‚Äîeither metaphorically opposed or neutral to the conduit-metaphor framework‚Äîresults in a list of 30 to 40 expressions. Thus, 70% of the metalingual apparatus of the English language is based on the conduit metaphor. The influence of the remaining 30% is weakened by several factors. * They are usually multisyllabic, Latinate abstractions (e.g. \\"communicate,\\" \\"disseminate,\\" \\"notify,\\" \\"disclose,\\" etc.), which are neither graphic nor metaphorically coherent * Most can be used with adjuncts such as \\"in words,\\" thereby losing their neutrality and lending added support to the conduit metaphor. (\\"Communicate your feelings using simpler words,\\" for example, avoids the conduit metaphor, whereas, \\"Communicate your feelings in simpler words,\\" does not.) * Many of these expressions have etymological roots arising directly from the conduit-metaphor framework (\\"express,\\" \\"disclose,\\" etc.)Reddy 1979, p. 298 Unavoidable Speaking carefully and attentively, it is possible to avoid conduit-metaphor expressions. For example, \\"Did you get anything out of that article?\\" might be replaced by, \\"Were you able to construct anything of interest on the basis of the assigned text?\\" Eschewing obvious conduit- metaphor expressions when communication is the topic is difficult. \\"Try to communicate more effectively\\" differs in impact from \\"You've got to learn how to put your thoughts into words.\\" Reddy proceeds to show that even if avoidance were possible, it does not necessarily free people from the framework.Reddy 1979, pp. 298‚Äì299 =Semantic pathology via metonymy= A semantic pathology arises \\"whenever two or more incompatible senses capable of figuring meaningfully in the same context develop around the same name.\\"Ullman, S. (1957). The Principles of Semantics (2nd ed.) (p. 122). London: Basil Blackwell \\"I'm sorry\\" is an example of two contextually relevant meanings in collision. A person may expect an apology when the other wishes only to sympathize, or anticipate sympathy but hear an apology instead.Reddy 1979, p. 299 Pathology in linguistic theory Many other terms are ambiguous between mental content and the words \\"containing\\" it. For instance the word \\"poem\\" denotes a particular grouping of the sounds or marks (signals) exchanged between people. However, its use in sentences reveals that it can refer to thoughts or feelings (repertoire members). In this example‚Äî :The poem has four lines and forty words ‚Äî\\"poem\\" refers to a text. The word- senseReddy, M. J. (1973). Formal referential models of poetic structure. In Papers from the Ninth Regional Meeting, Chicago Linguistic Society. Chicago: University of Chicago, Department of Linguistics can be labeled POEM1. However, in this example‚Äî :Eliot's poem is so utterly depressing ‚Äî\\"poem\\" refers to the mental content assembled in its reading. The word-sense in this case can be labeled POEM2. Moreover, this example‚Äî :Her poem is so sloppy! ‚Äîcan be understood as either POEM1 or POEM2 (polysemy). The ambiguity of \\"poem\\" is intimately related to the conduit metaphor. If words contain ideas, then POEM1 contains POEM2. When two entities are commonly found together, one of their names‚Äîusually the more concrete‚Äîwill develop a new sense referring to the other (the process of metonymy). Just as ROSE1 (the blossom) developed ROSE2 (a shade of pinkish red) by metonymy, so POEM1 gave rise to POEM2.Reddy 1979, pp. 299‚Äì300 In the toolmakers paradigm, words do not contain ideas, so POEM1 cannot contain POEM2; therefore, a distinction between them must be preserved. Although there is only one POEM1 in most cases, the differences in mental content among people (and the difficult task of assembling it based on instructions in the text) mean that there are as many POEM2s as there are people. These internal POEM2s will only come to resemble one another after people expend effort comparing their mental content. If language had been operating historically under the toolmakers paradigm, these two different concepts would not currently be accessed by the same word: talking about mental content and signals as if they were the same would have led to insoluble confusion. The ambiguity of \\"poem\\" would thus have been an incurable semantic pathology. However, the conduit metaphor can completely ignore it.Reddy 1979, pp. 300‚Äì301 \\"Poem\\" is a paradigm case for the entire class of English words denoting signals (\\"word,\\" \\"phrase,\\" \\"sentence,\\" \\"essay,\\" \\"novel,\\" \\"speech,\\" \\"text,\\" etc.), demonstrating that semantic structures can be completely normal in one view of reality and pathological in another. This lends support to the theory that language and views about reality develop together.Reddy 1979, p. 302 Pathology in mathematical information theory Evidence of the biasing power of the conduit metaphor can be found in fields outside of linguistics. Information theory, with its concept-free algorithms and computers as models, would seem to be immune from effects arising from semantic pathology, because the framework shares many attributes with the toolmakers paradigm. Nevertheless, there is evidence that use of the conduit metaphor has hampered investigators' attempts to develop the theory.Reddy 1979, pp. 302‚Äì303 Communication is the transfer of information (a selection from a set of alternatives). This set and a language (code) relating the alternatives to physical signals are established. A copy of each (an \\"a priori shared context\\") is placed with the sender and receiver. A sequence of the alternatives (the message) is selected for communication to the receiver, but the message itself is not sent. The selected alternatives are related by the code to energy patterns (the signal) that travel quickly and unmodified. Mathematics is used to measure quantitatively how much the received signal narrows down the possible selections from stored alternatives. The similarity between the frameworks of information theory and the toolmakers paradigm is that * the shared context corresponds to the repertoire members * the signal does not contain the message * the signal carries neither the alternatives nor a replica of the message * the signal in the former is the blueprint in the latter * the receiver uses the signal to duplicate the sender's selection process and recreate the message * if a signal is received and the shared context is damaged or missing, the proper selection cannot be madeReddy 1979, p. 303 This analogy has withstood information theory's utility in simple, technical applications, but in biology, the social sciences, human language and behavior, it has been historically less successful. These attempts foundered by misunderstanding the conceptual framework of the theory rather than its mathematics. Reliance on ordinary language has made the information theory's insights less clear.Cherry, C. (1980). On human communication: A review, a survey, and a criticism (3rd ed.). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. The negative impact of ordinary language on information theory's use in other fields can be traced to terms the founders themselves used to label parts of their paradigm, telegraphy. The set of alternatives (repertoire members) were called the \\"alphabet.\\" While true for telegraphy, Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver used it as a nomenclature referring to any set of alternative states, behaviors, etc.Shannon, C.E., & Weaver, W. (1949). The mathematical theory of information. Urbana: University of Illinois Press. The alphabet confuses the distinction between signals and repertoire members in human communication. Despite Weaver's particular interest in applying the theory to language, this fact went unrecognized. Shannon and Weaver were also unaware that the choice of the term \\"message\\" to represent the selection of alternatives from the repertoire shared the same semantic pathology as \\"poem.\\" #I got your message (MESSAGE1), but had no time to read it #Okay, John, I get the message (MESSAGE2); let‚Äôs leave him alone Because MESSAGE1 is the signal and MESSAGE2 is the repertoire members in communication, the reasoning is faulty. The ambiguity is trivial in the conduit-metaphor framework, but fatal for information theory, which is based on the idea that MESSAGE2 cannot be transmitted. Although Shannon and Weaver noted the distinction between \\"received\\" and \\"transmitted\\" signals based on possible distortion and noise, they wrote the word \\"message\\" on the receiving end of their paradigm.Shannon & Weaver 1949, p. 7Reddy 1979, pp. 304‚Äì305 Weaver employed many conduit-metaphor expressions; for example, \\"How precisely do the transmitted symbols convey the desired meaning?\\" [italics Reddy's].Shannon & Weaver 1949, p. 4 He also contrasted two \\"messages, one of which is heavily loaded with meaning and the other of which is pure nonsense.\\"Shannon & Weaver 1949, p. 8 Weaver wrote as if repertoire members are sent, adding that the sender \\"changes the message into the signal\\" [italics Weaver's].Shannon & Weaver 1949, p. 7 A code specifies how two systems relate, without changing anything; it preserves in the receiver the organizational pattern of the sender. Marks and sounds do not change into electrons, just as thoughts do not change into words. Shannon correctly wrote, \\"The receiver ordinarily performs the inverse operation of that done by the transmitter, reconstructing the message from the signal.\\"Shannon & Weaver 1949, p. 34 But conduit metaphorisms continue to appear in the form of \\"encode\\" and \\"decode,\\" defined as putting the repertoire members into code and taking them out, respectively. In addition, because the theory conceives of information as the ability to copy an organization via nonrandom selections, the term \\"information content\\" is itself a misnomer: signals do something but cannot contain anything. The conduit metaphor has thus influenced the thinking of information theorists in a counterproductive way.Reddy 1979, pp. 305‚Äì306 Confusion between the message and the signal persisted for two decades as theorists in other fields of inquiry drew on the insights of information theory. Kenneth K. Sereno and C. David Mortensen wrote that \\"investigators have yet to establish a completely acceptable definition of communication\\".Sereno, K., & Mortensen, C. (Eds.). (1970). Foundations of communication theory (p. 2). New York: Harper & Row. > \\"Those models based upon a mathematical conception describe communication as > analogous to the operations of an information processing machine: an event > occurs in which a source or sender transmits a signal or message through a > channel to some destination or receiver.\\" [italics Sereno & > Mortensen's]Sereno & Mortensen 1970, p. 71 Additionally, when they state, \\"The theory was concerned with the problem of defining the quantity of information contained in a message to be transmitted...,\\"Sereno & Mortensen 1970, p. 62 information is contained in a transmitted \\"message\\". If it refers to MESSAGE1, it is the conduit metaphor asserting that information is contained in the signals. If it is MESSAGE2, it is the repertoire members that are sent in signals, which contain measurable information. The insights of information theory have been challenged by using the conduit metaphor instead of the more accurate toolmakers paradigm, upon which its premises were initially based.Reddy 1979, p. 306 =Opposition of conflicting paradigms= The conduit-metaphor paradigm states that communication failure needs explanation, because success should be automatic: materials are naturally gathered, but misguided people expend energy scattering them. Conversely, the toolmakers paradigm states that partial miscommunication is inherent and can only be fixed by continuous effort and extensive verbal interaction: materials are gathered using energy or they will be naturally scattered. Reddy explores some of the potential social and psychological effects of believing that communication is a \\"success without effort\\" system, whereas it is an \\"energy must be expended\\" system. The conduit metaphor objectifies meaning and influences people to talk and think about mental content as if it possessed an external, inter-subjective reality.Reddy 1979, p. 308 =Cultural and social implications= Having discussed the conduit metaphor's impact on theorists within and outside of linguistics, Reddy speculates about its distorting potential in culture and society. He points out that :You'll find better ideas than that in the library is a conduit metaphor asserting that ideas are in words, which are on pages, which are in books, which are in libraries‚Äîwith the result that \\"ideas are in libraries.\\" The implication of this minor-framework core expression is that libraries full of books, tapes, photographs, videos and electronic media contain culture. In the toolmakers-paradigm perspective, there are no ideas in the words; therefore, none in libraries. Instead, there are patterns of marks, bumps or magnetized particles capable of creating patterns of noise and light. Using these patterns as instructions, people can reconstruct mental content resembling that of those long gone. Since people in the past experienced a different world and used slightly different language instructions, a person unschooled in the language and lacking a full reservoir of mental content from which to draw, is unlikely to reconstruct a cultural heritage. Because culture does not exist in books or libraries, it must be continually reconstructed in people's brains. Libraries preserve the opportunity to perform this reconstruction, but if language skills and the habit of reconstruction are not preserved, there will be no culture. Thus, Reddy asserts that the only way to preserve culture is to train people to \\"regrow\\" it in others. He stresses that the difference of viewpoint between the conduit metaphor and the toolmakers paradigm is profound. Humanists‚Äîthose traditionally charged with reconstructing culture and teaching others to reconstruct it‚Äîare increasingly rare. Reddy proposes that, despite a sophisticated system for mass communication, there is actually less communication; and moreover, that people are following a flawed manual. The conduit-metaphor influenced view is that the more signals created and preserved, the more ideas \\"transferred\\" and \\"stored.\\" Society is thus often neglecting the human ability to reconstruct thought patterns based on signals. This ability atrophies when \\"extraction\\" is seen as a trivial process not requiring instruction past a rudimentary level. Reddy concludes that the conduit metaphor may continue to have negative technological and social consequences: mass communications systems that largely ignore the internal, human systems responsible for the majority of the work in communicating. Because the logical framework of the conduit metaphor indicates people think in terms of \\"capturing ideas in words\\"‚Äîdespite there being no ideas \\"within\\" the ever-increasing stream of words‚Äîa burgeoning public may be less culturally informed than expected.Reddy 1979, pp. 309‚Äì310 Post-publication research by others Since the publication of Reddy's paper in 1979, it has garnered a large number of citations in linguistics, as well as a wide spectrum of other fields of inquiry.

The church is located in Durant, Iowa, United States. The church building and parish hall have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1985. History The Rt. Rev. Henry Washington Lee, the first bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Iowa, led the first services in Durant in the Rock Island Railroad depot in 1856. Freight boxes containing champagne were used for the pulpit, altar, and pews. A meeting was held after the service to organize the parish. The name St. Paul was chosen because many of the members had belonged to St. Paul's Episcopal Church in New Haven, Connecticut before moving to Iowa. The church in Connecticut contributed $75 that began the building fund for the church. Thomas C. Durant, the town's founder, donated land for the first church. It was located on the north side of town and was dedicated by Bishop Lee in October 1856. That same year a \\"seminary\\" for girls, or junior/senior high school, was established. In the early 1870s, the seminary curriculum was expanded to include boys and a library was built. The co- educational boarding and day school was renamed the Boardman School, after its primary benefactor. The school continued into the 1890s when Durant's public high school was established. The size of the congregation fluctuated with the local population in these same years. Because of the large number of German immigrants in Durant, services were held in the German language by 1879. with Parish Hall in 2014 By 1895 the congregation had outgrown its first building. On May 28 the original church was sold and the present building was purchased from the Congregationalists, who had built it in 1856. The bell, stained glass windows, and the furniture from the old church were moved to the new church. The chancel was added in 1895 to accommodate Episcopal worship. The parish hall was constructed next to the church by members of the congregation the same year. It has served as Sunday School building, vicar's office, town library, and town community center. It is thought the church's tower is from this same time period. Samuel A. Dutton was instrumental in St. Paul's acquiring the church. He joined the parish after settling here from New Milford, Connecticut. Dutton was very involved in parish life through the 1870s when he was dropped from the parish roles. He joined the Congregationalist Church where he became the Sunday school superintendent and he was one of three trustees when St. Paul's acquired the church building. Dutton re-joined St. Paul's at that point and remained until around 1916 when he established a private interdenominational Sunday school in town. A large part of St. Paul's congregation left with him. St. Paul's was unable to hold regular worship services from 1925 to 1944. During this time Gloria Dei Lutheran Church, which had been organized at this time, used the church building. In June 1944 the clergy and lay leaders from Trinity Episcopal Cathedral in Davenport restarted services. A parsonage was erected behind the church sometime between 1913 and 1948. The Rev. Vine Victor Deloria, first priest of Native American heritage to serve in the Diocese of Iowa, was vicar at St. Paul's from 1959-1960 after which he left the diocese. He had previously served as priest-in-charge at Trinity in Denison, Trinity Memorial in Mapleton, and St. John's in Vail. An undercroft was added to the church in 1950. The \\"gingerbread gothic\\" steeple and belfry were restored in 1979. In 1981, the pipe organ from Trinity Cathedral was rebuilt and moved to Saint Paul's. It was later replaced for $6,000 in 1985 by the Kilgen organ, which had been built about 1879. St. Paul's achieved parish status in 2004. Architctecture The church tower Both the church and the parish hall are rectangular wood frame structures built on concrete block foundations that have been simulated to appear as rusticated stone. The church's central tower is square in shape and it has a large diamond window centered on the front. The belfry is made up of eight chamfered columns with decorative gingerbread on its base and top. Located between the columns are crisscross braces that simulate a balcony effect. It is capped with a low pitched hip roof that is covered with tin. The belfry originally had a weather vane on top of it. The stained glass window above the main entrance of the church dates from 1870 and was originally a part of St. Barnabas Episcopal Church in Montrose, Iowa. It was given to St. Paul's in 1980 after St. Barnabas had been deconsecrated. Four lancet windows line the side walls. The parish hall features a forty-five degree turned corner tower and entryway. At one time it was capped with a spire. Elaborate shingling is found in the gable end, below the lancet windows on the main facade, and on the tower. A row of Maltese crosses are located at the cornice level of the tower. Three lancet windows line the side walls.

On a night out to the Royal Ballet at Covent Garden he meets a young woman named Anna (Versois), and the pair fall immediately in love. The problem is that Anna is the daughter of the Soviet ambassador in London. It is made clear to both that their relationship cannot continue in such a political climate, and their movements are constantly monitored by surveillance units from both sides. However they continue to meet in secret, attempting to outwit both the American and Soviet surveillance services. Eventually, when Anna discovers she is pregnant, the couple decide that their love is stronger than the demands of political exigency, and make their escape together across a stormy English Channel. The film is open-ended, with no indication as to whether or not they succeed. The Young Lovers was noted in its time for its relatively frank depiction of a sexual relationship between a non-married couple, and was praised for its even-handedness in presenting Anna's father (Kossoff) in a sympathetic manner, as a man torn between his political duty and the desire for his daughter's happiness.

It was introduced in August 2008 as an Experimental Order made under the authority of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. Experimental Orders may not, under the Act, last for more than 18 months, but do not require the formal advertisement and objection procedures of permanent Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs) made under the Act. In June 2009, Westminster Council gave notice that it was to turn this into a permanent Traffic Regulation Order. Rationale The Council stated that its reason for introducing the charge was that, as a consequence of the introduction of the London congestion charge in 2003, many more people had taken to riding motorcycles into the City of Westminster. 2008 figures stated that 16,000 motorcyclists rode into London every day, a rise of 40% in 10 years. Before introducing the Experimental Order, the council increased the number of motorcycle parking bays from 4,500 to 6,400 (6,150 on-street and 400 off-street). Initially, the charge was ¬£1.50 per day per motorcycle, with discounted rates for longer periods (¬£5 per week; ¬£20 per month; ¬£50 per quarter; and ¬£150 per annum). The permanent TRO differed from the Experimental Order in three major respects. Residents were allowed to park in designated motorcycle parking bays free of charge as long as they displayed a valid residents permit; parking in all of the off-street motorcycle parking bays was made free of charge; and the scale of charges was reduced. The new scale of charges was ¬£1 per day per motorcycle, with discounted rates for longer periods (¬£3.50 per week; ¬£13.50 per month; ¬£33.50 per quarter; and ¬£100 per annum). Consultation Prior to the Experimental Order in 2007, the Council had consulted with several interest groups, including the British Motorcyclists Federation (BMF). The BMF had campaigned against the charge, but in 2008 at the time of the issuance of the Experimental Order a spokesman reported that the Federation's members \\"on balance\\" thought that the deal of paying for parking spaces was \\"not a bad one\\", since motorcyclists didn't have to pay the London congestion charge and had lower running costs, even though the BMF members didn't like charges. Opposition Subsequent to the Experimental Order, the formal protest group No To Bike Parking Tax was formed to oppose the measures. It presented formal objections to the Council's Built Environmental Policy and Scrutiny Committee on 2009-03-31. It also organised several public protests, including \\"go-slows\\" where motorcyclists rode slowly through central London during peak \\"rush hour\\" traffic times causing road closures and traffic problems, in December 2008 and March 2009. On 16 April 2010, a local councillor Daniel Hamilton from Runnymede, having had his journey to work delayed by half an hour by a No To Bike Parking Tax rush-hour \\"go slow\\", called the demonstrators \\"tossers\\" on his Twitter account. In response, he received 200 emails, numerous text messages and telephone calls, including 15 death threats. In June 2010, Boris Johnson was caught up in the protests and was heard to make what were alleged to be \\"threats\\" against demonstrators. In March 2009, Westminster councillors responded to what they perceived to be a \\"hate campaign\\" organised by protesters, where councillors' names, addresses, and telephone numbers had been posted on the Internet, alongside threatening statements that people who supported the parking charge \\"must accept the consequences of their actions\\" and statements calling for \\"total war\\" against staff at the Council. Throughout, the Council maintained its position that the parking charges were necessary in order to meet the increased demand for motorcycle parking and would not be abolished. The campaigners maintained their opposition to the scheme, describing the councillors as \\"arrogant\\" and dismissing the charges that there was a \\"hate campaign\\" as an attempt to distract from the issue of the charge itself. The Council held that it was right that motorcyclists contributed towards road maintenance through the payment of a parking charge, while protesters countered that many motorcyclists could not afford the charge imposed. =High Court challenge= The No To Bike Parking Tax campaigners took the issue to the High Court, arguing that the parking charge was simply a device to raise revenue, and that the Council had not undertaken proper consultation in line with the Road Traffic Regulation Act. By 2009, revenue that Westminster Council was obtaining from parking charges in general, some ¬£81.5 million per annum from parking meters and parking fines, had already exceeded the ¬£80 million per annum revenue that it was obtaining from council tax. Councillor Danny Chalkley, the Council's cabinet member for city management, had stated then that no profit was made from parking charges, and that all surpluses (¬£35 million in 2008) were invested in the Council's transport projects. Many of the protesters had already asserted, via electronic mail to councillors, letters, and petitions with more than 3,000 signatures, that the Council was using the charge simply to raise revenue. By February 2009, the cost to the Council of creating the extra motorcycle parking bays and the additional security measures, some ¬£300,000, had been exceeded by the ¬£2.2 million that the Council had obtained from parking charges and fines. The High Court ruled against the campaigners on both counts in July 2010. Lord Justice Pitchford, who heard the case alongside Mr Justice Maddison, stated that the scheme had not been invalidated by Westminster Council budgeting for a modest surplus, nor did that mean that there was an ulterior motive in charging motorcyclists. The Council stated, after the ruling, that it was seeking reimbursement of its ¬£50,000 legal fees from Warren Djanogly, chairman of the NTBPT campaign, whose own legal fees were already estimated to be ¬£70,000.

It is a decentralized digital currency without a central bank or single administrator that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. Research produced by University of Cambridge estimates that in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using bitcoin. Bitcoin has been praised and criticized. Critics noted its use in illegal transactions, the large amount of electricity used by miners, price volatility, and thefts from exchanges. Some economists, including several Nobel laureates, have characterized it as a speculative bubble. Bitcoin has also been used as an investment, although several regulatory agencies have issued investor alerts about bitcoin. History =Creation= The domain name \\"bitcoin.org\\" was registered on 18 August 2008. On 31 October 2008, a link to a paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was posted to a cryptography mailing list. Nakamoto implemented the bitcoin software as open-source code and released it in January 2009. Nakamoto's identity remains unknown. On 3 January 2009, the bitcoin network was created when Nakamoto mined the starting block of the chain, known as the genesis block. Embedded in the coinbase of this block was the text \\"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\\". This note references a headline published by The Times and has been interpreted as both a timestamp and a comment on the instability caused by fractional-reserve banking. The receiver of the first bitcoin transaction was cypherpunk Hal Finney, who had created the first reusable proof-of-work system (RPoW) in 2004. Finney downloaded the bitcoin software on its release date, and on 12 January 2009 received ten bitcoins from Nakamoto. Other early cypherpunk supporters were creators of bitcoin predecessors: Wei Dai, creator of b-money, and Nick Szabo, creator of bit gold. In 2010, the first known commercial transaction using bitcoin occurred when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz bought two Papa John's pizzas for ‚Çø10,000. Blockchain analysts estimate that Nakamoto had mined about one million bitcoins before disappearing in 2010, when he handed the network alert key and control of the code repository over to Gavin Andresen. Andresen later became lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation. Andresen then sought to decentralize control. This left opportunity for controversy to develop over the future development path of bitcoin, in contrast to the perceived authority of Nakamoto's contributions. =2011‚Äì2012= After early \\"proof-of-concept\\" transactions, the first major users of bitcoin were black markets, such as Silk Road. During its 30 months of existence, beginning in February 2011, Silk Road exclusively accepted bitcoins as payment, transacting 9.9 million in bitcoins, worth about $214 million. In 2011, the price started at $0.30 per bitcoin, growing to $5.27 for the year. The price rose to $31.50 on 8 June. Within a month the price fell to $11.00. The next month it fell to $7.80, and in another month to $4.77. In 2012, bitcoin prices started at $5.27 growing to $13.30 for the year. By 9 January the price had risen to $7.38, but then crashed by 49% to $3.80 over the next 16 days. The price then rose to $16.41 on 17 August, but fell by 57% to $7.10 over the next three days. The Bitcoin Foundation was founded in September 2012 to promote bitcoin's development and uptake. On 1 November 2011, the reference implementation Bitcoin-Qt version 0.5.0 was released. It introduced a front end that used the Qt user interface toolkit. The software previously used Berkeley DB for database management. Developers switched to LevelDB in release 0.8 in order to reduce blockchain synchronization time. The update to this release resulted in a minor blockchain fork on the 11 March 2013. The fork was resolved shortly afterwards. Seeding nodes through IRC was discontinued in version 0.8.2. From version 0.9.0 the software was renamed to Bitcoin Core. Transaction fees were reduced again by a factor of ten as a means to encourage microtransactions. Although Bitcoin Core does not use OpenSSL for the operation of the network, the software did use OpenSSL for remote procedure calls. Version 0.9.1 was released to remove the network's vulnerability to the Heartbleed bug. =2013‚Äì2016= In 2013, prices started at $13.30 rising to $770 by 1 January 2014. In March 2013 the blockchain temporarily split into two independent chains with different rules due to a bug in version 0.8 of the bitcoin software. The two blockchains operated simultaneously for six hours, each with its own version of the transaction history from the moment of the split. Normal operation was restored when the majority of the network downgraded to version 0.7 of the bitcoin software, selecting the backward-compatible version of the blockchain. As a result, this blockchain became the longest chain and could be accepted by all participants, regardless of their bitcoin software version. During the split, the Mt. Gox exchange briefly halted bitcoin deposits and the price dropped by 23% to $37 before recovering to previous level of approximately $48 in the following hours. The US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) established regulatory guidelines for \\"decentralized virtual currencies\\" such as bitcoin, classifying American bitcoin miners who sell their generated bitcoins as Money Service Businesses (MSBs), that are subject to registration or other legal obligations. In April, exchanges BitInstant and Mt. Gox experienced processing delays due to insufficient capacityRoose, Kevin (8 April 2013) . Nymag.com. Retrieved on 20 April 2013. resulting in the bitcoin price dropping from $266 to $76 before returning to $160 within six hours. The bitcoin price rose to $259 on 10 April, but then crashed by 83% to $45 over the next three days. On 15 May 2013, US authorities seized accounts associated with Mt. Gox after discovering it had not registered as a money transmitter with FinCEN in the US. On 23 June 2013, the US Drug Enforcement Administration listed ‚Çø11.02 as a seized asset in a United States Department of Justice seizure notice pursuant to 21 U.S.C. ¬ß 881. This marked the first time a government agency had seized bitcoin. The FBI seized about ‚Çø30,000 in October 2013 from the dark web website Silk Road, following the arrest of Ross William Ulbricht. These bitcoins were sold at blind auction by the United States Marshals Service to venture capital investor Tim Draper. Bitcoin's price rose to $755 on 19 November and crashed by 50% to $378 the same day. On 30 November 2013 the price reached $1,163 before starting a long-term crash, declining by 87% to $152 in January 2015. On 5 December 2013, the People's Bank of China prohibited Chinese financial institutions from using bitcoins. After the announcement, the value of bitcoins dropped, and Baidu no longer accepted bitcoins for certain services. Buying real-world goods with any virtual currency had been illegal in China since at least 2009. In 2014, prices started at $770 and fell to $314 for the year. On 30 July 2014, the Wikimedia Foundation started accepting donations of bitcoin. In 2015, prices started at $314 and rose to $434 for the year. In 2016, prices rose and climbed up to $998 by 1 January 2017. Release 0.10 of the software was made public on 16 February 2015. It introduced a consensus library which gave programmers easy access to the rules governing consensus on the network. In version 0.11.2 developers added a new feature which allowed transactions to be made unspendable until a specific time in the future. Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 was released on April 15, 2016 and enabled multiple soft forks to occur concurrently. Around 100 contributors worked on Bitcoin Core 0.13.0 which was released on 23 August 2016. In July 2016, the CheckSequenceVerify soft fork activated. In October 2016, Bitcoin Core‚Äôs 0.13.1 release featured the \\"Segwit\\" soft fork that included a scaling improvement aiming to optimize the bitcoin blocksize. The patch which was originally finalised in April, and 35 developers were engaged to deploy it. This release featured Segregated Witness (SegWit) which aimed to place downward pressure on transaction fees as well as increase the maximum transaction capacity of the network. The 0.13.1 release endured extensive testing and research leading to some delays in its release date. SegWit prevents various forms of transaction malleability. =2017‚Äì2019= On 15 July 2017, the controversial Segregated Witness [SegWit] software upgrade was approved (\\"locked in\\"). Segwit was intended to support the Lightning Network as well as improve scalability. SegWit was subsequently activated on the network on 24 August 2017. The bitcoin price rose almost 50% in the week following SegWit's approval. On 21 July 2017, bitcoin was trading at $2,748, up 52% from 14 July 2017's $1,835. Supporters of large blocks who were dissatisfied with the activation of SegWit forked the software on 1 August 2017 to create Bitcoin Cash. Prices started at $998 in 2017 and rose to $13,412.44 on 1 January 2018, after reaching its all-time high of $19,783.06 on 17 December 2017. China banned trading in bitcoin, with first steps taken in September 2017, and a complete ban that started on 1 February 2018. Bitcoin prices then fell from $9,052 to $6,914 on 5 February 2018. The percentage of bitcoin trading in the Chinese renminbi fell from over 90% in September 2017 to less than 1% in June 2018. Throughout the rest of the first half of 2018, bitcoin's price fluctuated between $11,480 and $5,848. On 1 July 2018, bitcoin's price was $6,343. The price on 1 January 2019 was $3,747, down 72% for 2018 and down 81% since the all-time high. In September 2018, an anonymous party discovered and reported an invalid-block denial-of-server vulnerability to developers of Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin Unlimited. Further analysis by bitcoin developers showed the issue could also allow the creation of blocks violating the 21 million coin limit and was assigned and the issue resolved. Bitcoin prices were negatively affected by several hacks or thefts from cryptocurrency exchanges, including thefts from Coincheck in January 2018, Coinrail and Bithumb in June, and Bancor in July. For the first six months of 2018, $761 million worth of cryptocurrencies was reported stolen from exchanges. Bitcoin's price was affected even though other cryptocurrencies were stolen at Coinrail and Bancor as investors worried about the security of cryptocurrency exchanges. In September 2019 the Intercontinental Exchange (the owner of the NYSE) began trading of bitcoin futures on its exchange called Bakkt. Bakkt also announced that it would launch options on bitcoin in December 2019. In December 2019 YouTube removed bitcoin and cryptocurrency videos, but later restored the content after judging they had \\"made the wrong call.\\" In February 2019, Canadian cryptocurrency exchange Quadriga Fintech Solutions failed with approximately $200 million missing. By June 2019 the price had recovered to $13,000. =2020= According to CoinMetrics and Forbes, on 11 March 281,000 bitcoins were sold by owners who held them for only thirty days. This compared to 4,131 bitcoins that had laid dormant for a year or more indicating that the vast majority of the bitcoin volatility on that day was from recent buyers. During the week of 11 March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, cryptocurrency exchange Kraken experienced an 83% increase in the amount of account signups over the week of bitcoin's price collapse, a result of buyers looking to capitalize on the low price. Design =Units and divisibility= The unit of account of the bitcoin system is a bitcoin. Ticker symbols used to represent bitcoin are BTC and XBT. Its Unicode character is ‚Çø. Small amounts of bitcoin used as alternative units are millibitcoin (mBTC), and satoshi (sat). Named in homage to bitcoin's creator, a satoshi is the smallest amount within bitcoin representing bitcoins, one hundred millionth of a bitcoin. A millibitcoin equals bitcoins; one thousandth of a bitcoin or 100,000 satoshis. =Blockchain= Data structure of blocks in the ledger. The bitcoin blockchain is a public ledger that records bitcoin transactions. It is implemented as a chain of blocks, each block containing a hash of the previous block up to the genesis block of the chain. A network of communicating nodes running bitcoin software maintains the blockchain. Transactions of the form payer X sends Y bitcoins to payee Z are broadcast to this network using readily available software applications. Network nodes can validate transactions, add them to their copy of the ledger, and then broadcast these ledger additions to other nodes. To achieve independent verification of the chain of ownership each network node stores its own copy of the blockchain. At varying intervals of time averaging to every 10 minutes, a new group of accepted transactions, called a block, is created, added to the blockchain, and quickly published to all nodes, without requiring central oversight. This allows bitcoin software to determine when a particular bitcoin was spent, which is needed to prevent double-spending. A conventional ledger records the transfers of actual bills or promissory notes that exist apart from it, but the blockchain is the only place that bitcoins can be said to exist in the form of unspent outputs of transactions. =Transactions= Transactions are defined using a Forth-like scripting language. Transactions consist of one or more inputs and one or more outputs. When a user sends bitcoins, the user designates each address and the amount of bitcoin being sent to that address in an output. To prevent double spending, each input must refer to a previous unspent output in the blockchain. The use of multiple inputs corresponds to the use of multiple coins in a cash transaction. Since transactions can have multiple outputs, users can send bitcoins to multiple recipients in one transaction. As in a cash transaction, the sum of inputs (coins used to pay) can exceed the intended sum of payments. In such a case, an additional output is used, returning the change back to the payer. Any input satoshis not accounted for in the transaction outputs become the transaction fee. Transaction fees Though transaction fees are optional, miners can choose which transactions to process and prioritize those that pay higher fees. Miners may choose transactions based on the fee paid relative to their storage size, not the absolute amount of money paid as a fee. These fees are generally measured in satoshis per byte (sat/b). The size of transactions is dependent on the number of inputs used to create the transaction, and the number of outputs. =Ownership= Simplified chain of ownership as illustrated in the bitcoin whitepaper. In practice, a transaction can have more than one input and more than one output. In the blockchain, bitcoins are registered to bitcoin addresses. Creating a bitcoin address requires nothing more than picking a random valid private key and computing the corresponding bitcoin address. This computation can be done in a split second. But the reverse, computing the private key of a given bitcoin address, is practically unfeasible. Users can tell others or make public a bitcoin address without compromising its corresponding private key. Moreover, the number of valid private keys is so vast that it is extremely unlikely someone will compute a key-pair that is already in use and has funds. The vast number of valid private keys makes it unfeasible that brute force could be used to compromise a private key. To be able to spend their bitcoins, the owner must know the corresponding private key and digitally sign the transaction. The network verifies the signature using the public key; the private key is never revealed. If the private key is lost, the bitcoin network will not recognize any other evidence of ownership; the coins are then unusable, and effectively lost. For example, in 2013 one user claimed to have lost 7,500 bitcoins, worth $7.5 million at the time, when he accidentally discarded a hard drive containing his private key. About 20% of all bitcoins are believed to be lost. They would have a market value of about $20 billion at July 2018 prices. To ensure the security of bitcoins, the private key must be kept secret. If the private key is revealed to a third party, e.g. through a data breach, the third party can use it to steal any associated bitcoins. , around 980,000 bitcoins have been stolen from cryptocurrency exchanges. Regarding ownership distribution, as of 16 March 2018, 0.5% of bitcoin wallets own 87% of all bitcoins ever mined. =Mining= Semi-log plot of relative mining difficulty Mining is a record-keeping service done through the use of computer processing power. Miners keep the blockchain consistent, complete, and unalterable by repeatedly grouping newly broadcast transactions into a block, which is then broadcast to the network and verified by recipient nodes. Each block contains a SHA-256 cryptographic hash of the previous block, thus linking it to the previous block and giving the blockchain its name. To be accepted by the rest of the network, a new block must contain a proof-of-work (PoW). The system used is based on Adam Back's 1997 anti-spam scheme, Hashcash. The PoW requires miners to find a number called a nonce, such that when the block content is hashed along with the nonce, the result is numerically smaller than the network's difficulty target. This proof is easy for any node in the network to verify, but extremely time-consuming to generate, as for a secure cryptographic hash, miners must try many different nonce values (usually the sequence of tested values is the ascending natural numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, ...) before meeting the difficulty target. Every 2,016 blocks (approximately 14 days at roughly 10 min per block), the difficulty target is adjusted based on the network's recent performance, with the aim of keeping the average time between new blocks at ten minutes. In this way the system automatically adapts to the total amount of mining power on the network. Between 1 March 2014 and 1 March 2015, the average number of nonces miners had to try before creating a new block increased from 16.4 quintillion to 200.5 quintillion. The proof-of- work system, alongside the chaining of blocks, makes modifications of the blockchain extremely hard, as an attacker must modify all subsequent blocks in order for the modifications of one block to be accepted. As new blocks are mined all the time, the difficulty of modifying a block increases as time passes and the number of subsequent blocks (also called confirmations of the given block) increases. Supply Total bitcoins in circulation. The successful miner finding the new block is allowed by the rest of the network to reward themselves with newly created bitcoins and transaction fees. , the reward amounted to 6.25 newly created bitcoins per block added to the blockchain, plus any transaction fees from payments processed by the block. To claim the reward, a special transaction called a coinbase is included with the processed payments. All bitcoins in existence have been created in such coinbase transactions. The bitcoin protocol specifies that the reward for adding a block will be halved every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years). Eventually, the reward will decrease to zero, and the limit of 21 million bitcoins will be reached 2140; the record keeping will then be rewarded solely by transaction fees. In other words, Nakamoto set a monetary policy based on artificial scarcity at bitcoin's inception that the total number of bitcoins could never exceed 21 million. New bitcoins are created roughly every ten minutes and the rate at which they are generated drops by half about every four years until all will be in circulation. Pooled mining Computing power is often bundled together or \\"pooled\\" to reduce variance in miner income. Individual mining rigs often have to wait for long periods to confirm a block of transactions and receive payment. In a pool, all participating miners get paid every time a participating server solves a block. This payment depends on the amount of work an individual miner contributed to help find that block. =Wallets= A wallet stores the information necessary to transact bitcoins. While wallets are often described as a place to hold or store bitcoins, due to the nature of the system, bitcoins are inseparable from the blockchain transaction ledger. A wallet is more correctly defined as something that \\"stores the digital credentials for your bitcoin holdings\\" and allows one to access (and spend) them. Bitcoin uses public-key cryptography, in which two cryptographic keys, one public and one private, are generated. At its most basic, a wallet is a collection of these keys. There are several modes which wallets can operate in. They have an inverse relationship with regards to trustlessness and computational requirements. * Full clients verify transactions directly by downloading a full copy of the blockchain (over 150 GB ). They are the most secure and reliable way of using the network, as trust in external parties is not required. Full clients check the validity of mined blocks, preventing them from transacting on a chain that breaks or alters network rules. Because of its size and complexity, downloading and verifying the entire blockchain is not suitable for all computing devices. * Lightweight clients consult full clients to send and receive transactions without requiring a local copy of the entire blockchain (see simplified payment verification ‚Äì SPV). This makes lightweight clients much faster to set up and allows them to be used on low- power, low-bandwidth devices such as smartphones. When using a lightweight wallet, however, the user must trust the server to a certain degree, as it can report faulty values back to the user. Lightweight clients follow the longest blockchain and do not ensure it is valid, requiring trust in miners. Third- party internet services called online wallets offer similar functionality but may be easier to use. In this case, credentials to access funds are stored with the online wallet provider rather than on the user's hardware. As a result, the user must have complete trust in the online wallet provider. A malicious provider or a breach in server security may cause entrusted bitcoins to be stolen. An example of such a security breach occurred with Mt. Gox in 2011. Physical wallets Physical wallets store the credentials necessary to spend bitcoins offline and can be as simple as a paper printout of the private key: a paper wallet. A paper wallet is created with a keypair generated on a computer with no internet connection; the private key is written or printed onto the paper and then erased from the computer. The paper wallet can then be stored in a safe physical location for later retrieval. Bitcoins stored using a paper wallet are said to be in cold storage. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the founders of the Gemini Trust Co. exchange, reported that they had cut their paper wallets into pieces and stored them in envelopes distributed to safe deposit boxes across the United States. Through this system, the theft of one envelope would neither allow the thief to steal any bitcoins nor deprive the rightful owners of their access to them. Physical wallets can also take the form of metal token coins with a private key accessible under a security hologram in a recess struck on the reverse side. The security hologram self-destructs when removed from the token, showing that the private key has been accessed. Originally, these tokens were struck in brass and other base metals, but later used precious metals as bitcoin grew in value and popularity. Coins with stored face value as high as ‚Çø1000 have been struck in gold. The British Museum's coin collection includes four specimens from the earliest series of funded bitcoin tokens; one is currently on display in the museum's money gallery. In 2013, a Utahn manufacturer of these tokens was ordered by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to register as a money services business before producing any more funded bitcoin tokens. Another type of physical wallet called a hardware wallet keeps credentials offline while facilitating transactions. The hardware wallet acts as a computer peripheral and signs transactions as requested by the user, who must press a button on the wallet to confirm that they intended to make the transaction. Hardware wallets never expose their private keys, keeping bitcoins in cold storage even when used with computers that may be compromised by malware. =Implementations= The first wallet program, simply named Bitcoin, and sometimes referred to as the Satoshi client, was released in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto as open-source software. In version 0.5 the client moved from the wxWidgets user interface toolkit to Qt, and the whole bundle was referred to as Bitcoin-Qt. After the release of version 0.9, the software bundle was renamed Bitcoin Core to distinguish itself from the underlying network. Forks Bitcoin Core is, perhaps, the best known implementation or client. Alternative clients (forks of Bitcoin Core) exist, such as Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Unlimited, and Parity Bitcoin. On 1 August 2017, Bitcoin Cash was created as result of a hard fork. Bitcoin Cash has a larger block size limit and had an identical blockchain at the time of fork. On 24 October 2017 another hard fork, Bitcoin Gold, was created. Bitcoin Gold changes the proof- of-work algorithm used in mining, as the developers felt that mining had become too specialized. =Decentralization= Bitcoin is decentralized: * Bitcoin does not have a central authority. * There is no central server; the bitcoin network is peer-to-peer. * There is no central storage; the bitcoin ledger is distributed. * The ledger is public; anybody can store it on their computer. * There is no single administrator; the ledger is maintained by a network of equally privileged miners. * Anybody can become a miner. * The additions to the ledger are maintained through competition. Until a new block is added to the ledger, it is not known which miner will create the block. * The issuance of bitcoins is decentralized. They are issued as a reward for the creation of a new block. * Anybody can create a new bitcoin address (a bitcoin counterpart of a bank account) without needing any approval. * Anybody can send a transaction to the network without needing any approval; the network merely confirms that the transaction is legitimate. Trend towards centralization Researchers have pointed out at a \\"trend towards centralization\\". Although bitcoin can be sent directly from user to user, in practice intermediaries are widely used. Bitcoin miners join large mining pools to minimize the variance of their income. Because transactions on the network are confirmed by miners, decentralization of the network requires that no single miner or mining pool obtains 51% of the hashing power, which would allow them to double-spend coins, prevent certain transactions from being verified and prevent other miners from earning income. just six mining pools controlled 75% of overall bitcoin hashing power. In 2014 mining pool Ghash.io obtained 51% hashing power which raised significant controversies about the safety of the network. The pool has voluntarily capped their hashing power at 39.99% and requested other pools to act responsibly for the benefit of the whole network. over 70% of the hashing power and 90% of transactions were operating from China. According to researchers, other parts of the ecosystem are also \\"controlled by a small set of entities\\", notably the maintenance of the client software, online wallets and simplified payment verification (SPV) clients. =Privacy= Bitcoin is pseudonymous, meaning that funds are not tied to real-world entities but rather bitcoin addresses. Owners of bitcoin addresses are not explicitly identified, but all transactions on the blockchain are public. In addition, transactions can be linked to individuals and companies through \\"idioms of use\\" (e.g., transactions that spend coins from multiple inputs indicate that the inputs may have a common owner) and corroborating public transaction data with known information on owners of certain addresses. Additionally, bitcoin exchanges, where bitcoins are traded for traditional currencies, may be required by law to collect personal information. To heighten financial privacy, a new bitcoin address can be generated for each transaction. =Fungibility= Wallets and similar software technically handle all bitcoins as equivalent, establishing the basic level of fungibility. Researchers have pointed out that the history of each bitcoin is registered and publicly available in the blockchain ledger, and that some users may refuse to accept bitcoins coming from controversial transactions, which would harm bitcoin's fungibility. For example, in 2012, Mt. Gox froze accounts of users who deposited bitcoins that were known to have just been stolen. =Scalability= The blocks in the blockchain were originally limited to 32 megabytes in size. The block size limit of one megabyte was introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2010. Eventually the block size limit of one megabyte created problems for transaction processing, such as increasing transaction fees and delayed processing of transactions. Andreas Antonopoulos has stated Lightning Network is a potential scaling solution and referred to lightning as a second layer routing network. Ideology Satoshi Nakamoto stated in his white paper that: \\"The root problem with conventional currencies is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.\\" =Austrian economics roots= According to the European Central Bank, the decentralization of money offered by bitcoin has its theoretical roots in the Austrian school of economics, especially with Friedrich von Hayek in his book Denationalisation of Money: The Argument Refined, in which Hayek advocates a complete free market in the production, distribution and management of money to end the monopoly of central banks. =Anarchism and libertarianism= According to The New York Times, libertarians and anarchists were attracted to the idea. Early bitcoin supporter Roger Ver said: \\"At first, almost everyone who got involved did so for philosophical reasons. We saw bitcoin as a great idea, as a way to separate money from the state.\\" The Economist describes bitcoin as \\"a techno-anarchist project to create an online version of cash, a way for people to transact without the possibility of interference from malicious governments or banks\\". Economist Paul Krugman argues that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are \\"something of a cult\\" based in \\"paranoid fantasies\\" of government power. Nigel Dodd argues in The Social Life of Bitcoin that the essence of the bitcoin ideology is to remove money from social, as well as governmental, control. Dodd quotes a YouTube video, with Roger Ver, Jeff Berwick, Charlie Shrem, Andreas Antonopoulos, Gavin Wood, Trace Meyer and other proponents of bitcoin reading The Declaration of Bitcoin's Independence. The declaration includes a message of crypto-anarchism with the words: \\"Bitcoin is inherently anti-establishment, anti-system, and anti-state. Bitcoin undermines governments and disrupts institutions because bitcoin is fundamentally humanitarian.\\" David Golumbia says that the ideas influencing bitcoin advocates emerge from right-wing extremist movements such as the Liberty Lobby and the John Birch Society and their anti-Central Bank rhetoric, or, more recently, Ron Paul and Tea Party-style libertarianism. Steve Bannon, who owns a \\"good stake\\" in bitcoin, considers it to be \\"disruptive populism. It takes control back from central authorities. It's revolutionary.\\" A 2014 study of Google Trends data found correlations between bitcoin-related searches and ones related to computer programming and illegal activity, but not libertarianism or investment topics. Economics Liquidity, semilogarithmic plot. Bitcoin is a digital asset designed to work in peer-to-peer transactions as a currency. Bitcoins have three qualities useful in a currency, according to The Economist in January 2015: they are \\"hard to earn, limited in supply and easy to verify.\\" Per some researchers, , bitcoin functions more as a payment system than as a currency. Economists define money as serving the following three purposes: a store of value, a medium of exchange, and a unit of account. According to The Economist in 2014, bitcoin functions best as a medium of exchange. However, this is debated, and a 2018 assessment by The Economist stated that cryptocurrencies met none of these three criteria. Yale economist Robert J. Shiller writes that bitcoin has potential as a unit of account for measuring the relative value of goods, as with Chile's Unidad de Fomento, but that \\"Bitcoin in its present form [...] doesn‚Äôt really solve any sensible economic problem\\". According to research by Cambridge University, between 2.9 million and 5.8 million unique users used a cryptocurrency wallet in 2017, most of them for bitcoin. The number of users has grown significantly since 2013, when there were 300,000‚Äì1.3 million users. =Acceptance by merchants= The overwhelming majority of bitcoin transactions take place on a cryptocurrency exchange, rather than being used in transactions with merchants. Delays processing payments through the blockchain of about ten minutes make bitcoin use very difficult in a retail setting. Prices are not usually quoted in units of bitcoin and many trades involve one, or sometimes two, conversions into conventional currencies. Merchants that do accept bitcoin payments may use payment service providers to perform the conversions. In 2017 and 2018 bitcoin's acceptance among major online retailers included only three of the top 500 U.S. online merchants, down from five in 2016. Reasons for this decline include high transaction fees due to bitcoin's scalability issues and long transaction times. Bloomberg reported that the largest 17 crypto merchant-processing services handled $69 million in June 2018, down from $411 million in September 2017. Bitcoin is \\"not actually usable\\" for retail transactions because of high costs and the inability to process chargebacks, according to Nicholas Weaver, a researcher quoted by Bloomberg. High price volatility and transaction fees make paying for small retail purchases with bitcoin impractical, according to economist Kim Grauer. However, bitcoin continues to be used for large-item purchases on sites such as Overstock.com, and for cross-border payments to freelancers and other vendors. =Financial institutions= Bitcoins can be bought on digital currency exchanges. Per researchers, \\"there is little sign of bitcoin use\\" in international remittances despite high fees charged by banks and Western Union who compete in this market. The South China Morning Post, however, mentions the use of bitcoin by Hong Kong workers to transfer money home. In 2014, the National Australia Bank closed accounts of businesses with ties to bitcoin, and HSBC refused to serve a hedge fund with links to bitcoin. Australian banks in general have been reported as closing down bank accounts of operators of businesses involving the currency. On 10 December 2017, the Chicago Board Options Exchange started trading bitcoin futures, followed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which started trading bitcoin futures on 17 December 2017. In September 2019 the Central Bank of Venezuela, at the request of PDVSA, ran tests to determine if bitcoin and ether could be held in central bank's reserves. The request was motivated by oil company's goal to pay its suppliers. =As an investment= The Winklevoss twins have purchased bitcoin. In 2013, The Washington Post reported a claim that they owned 1% of all the bitcoins in existence at the time. Other methods of investment are bitcoin funds. The first regulated bitcoin fund was established in Jersey in July 2014 and approved by the Jersey Financial Services Commission. Forbes named bitcoin the best investment of 2013. In 2014, Bloomberg named bitcoin one of its worst investments of the year. In 2015, bitcoin topped Bloomberg's currency tables. According to bitinfocharts.com, in 2017 there are 9,272 bitcoin wallets with more than $1 million worth of bitcoins. The exact number of bitcoin millionaires is uncertain as a single person can have more than one bitcoin wallet. =Venture capital= Peter Thiel's Founders Fund invested million in BitPay. In 2012, an incubator for bitcoin-focused start-ups was founded by Adam Draper, with financing help from his father, venture capitalist Tim Draper, one of the largest bitcoin holders after winning an auction of 30,000 bitcoins, at the time called \\"mystery buyer\\". The company's goal is to fund 100 bitcoin businesses within 2‚Äì3 years with $10,000 to $20,000 for a 6% stake. Investors also invest in bitcoin mining. According to a 2015 study by Paolo Tasca, bitcoin startups raised almost $1 billion in three years (Q1 2012 ‚Äì Q1 2015). =Price and volatility= The price of bitcoins has gone through cycles of appreciation and depreciation referred to by some as bubbles and busts. In 2011, the value of one bitcoin rapidly rose from about US$0.30 to US$32 before returning to US$2. In the latter half of 2012 and during the 2012‚Äì13 Cypriot financial crisis, the bitcoin price began to rise, reaching a high of US$266 on 10 April 2013, before crashing to around US$50. On 29 November 2013, the cost of one bitcoin rose to a peak of US$1,242. In 2014, the price fell sharply, and as of April remained depressed at little more than half 2013 prices. it was under US$600. According to Mark T. Williams, , bitcoin has volatility seven times greater than gold, eight times greater than the S&P; 500, and 18 times greater than the US dollar. Legal status, tax and regulation Because of bitcoin's decentralized nature and its trading on online exchanges located in many countries, regulation of bitcoin has been difficult. However, the use of bitcoin can be criminalized, and shutting down exchanges and the peer-to-peer economy in a given country would constitute a de facto ban. The legal status of bitcoin varies substantially from country to country and is still undefined or changing in many of them. Regulations and bans that apply to bitcoin probably extend to similar cryptocurrency systems. According to the Library of Congress, an \\"absolute ban\\" on trading or using cryptocurrencies applies in nine countries: Algeria, Bolivia, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Nepal, Pakistan, Vietnam, and the United Arab Emirates. An \\"implicit ban\\" applies in another 15 countries, which include Bahrain, Bangladesh, China, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Indonesia, Iran, Kuwait, Lesotho, Lithuania, Macau, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Taiwan. =Regulatory warnings= The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission has issued four \\"Customer Advisories\\" for bitcoin and related investments. A July 2018 warning emphasized that trading in any cryptocurrency is often speculative, and there is a risk of theft from hacking, and fraud. In May 2014 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warned that investments involving bitcoin might have high rates of fraud, and that investors might be solicited on social media sites. An earlier \\"Investor Alert\\" warned about the use of bitcoin in Ponzi schemes. The European Banking Authority issued a warning in 2013 focusing on the lack of regulation of bitcoin, the chance that exchanges would be hacked, the volatility of bitcoin's price, and general fraud. FINRA and the North American Securities Administrators Association have both issued investor alerts about bitcoin. =Price manipulation investigation= An official investigation into bitcoin traders was reported in May 2018. The U.S. Justice Department launched an investigation into possible price manipulation, including the techniques of spoofing and wash trades. The U.S. federal investigation was prompted by concerns of possible manipulation during futures settlement dates. The final settlement price of CME bitcoin futures is determined by prices on four exchanges, Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit and Kraken. Following the first delivery date in January 2018, the CME requested extensive detailed trading information but several of the exchanges refused to provide it and later provided only limited data. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission then subpoenaed the data from the exchanges. Note:this is a short open access version of a Wall Street Journal article (paywalled) State and provincial securities regulators, coordinated through the North American Securities Administrators Association, are investigating \\"bitcoin scams\\" and ICOs in 40 jurisdictions. Academic research published in the Journal of Monetary Economics concluded that price manipulation occurred during the Mt Gox bitcoin theft and that the market remains vulnerable to manipulation. The history of hacks, fraud and theft involving bitcoin dates back to at least 2011. Research by John M. Griffin and Amin Shams in 2018 suggests that trading associated with increases in the amount of the Tether cryptocurrency and associated trading at the Bitfinex exchange account for about half of the price increase in bitcoin in late 2017. J.L. van der Velde, CEO of both Bitfinex and Tether, denied the claims of price manipulation: \\"Bitfinex nor Tether is, or has ever, engaged in any sort of market or price manipulation. Tether issuances cannot be used to prop up the price of bitcoin or any other coin/token on Bitfinex.\\" Criticism The Bank for International Settlements summarized several criticisms of bitcoin in Chapter V of their 2018 annual report. The criticisms include the lack of stability in bitcoin's price, the high energy consumption, high and variable transactions costs, the poor security and fraud at cryptocurrency exchanges, vulnerability to debasement (from forking), and the influence of miners. The Economist describes these criticisms as unfair, predominantly because the shady image may compel users to overlook the capabilities of the blockchain technology, but also due to the fact that the volatility of bitcoin is changing in time. =As a speculative bubble= Bitcoin price bubbles in 2011, 2013 and 2017 Bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies, has been described as an economic bubble by at least eight Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences laureates, including Robert Shiller, Joseph Stiglitz, and Richard Thaler. Noted Keynesian economist Paul Krugman has described bitcoin as \\"a bubble wrapped in techno-mysticism inside a cocoon of libertarian ideology\\", professor Nouriel Roubini of New York University has called bitcoin the \\"mother of all bubbles\\", and University of Chicago economist James Heckman has compared it to the 17th-century tulip mania. Alan Greenspan and George Soros both referred to it as a \\"bubble\\". Warren Buffett called bitcoin a \\"mirage\\". =Energy consumption= Bitcoin has been criticized for the amount of electricity consumed by mining. , The Economist estimated that even if all miners used modern facilities, the combined electricity consumption would be 166.7 megawatts (1.46 terawatt-hours per year). At the end of 2017, the global bitcoin mining activity was estimated to consume between one and four gigawatts of electricity. By 2018, bitcoin was estimated by Joule to use 2.55 GW, while Environmental Science & Technology estimated bitcoin to consume 3.572 GW (31.29 TWh for the year). In July 2019 BBC reported bitcoin consumes about 7 gigawatts, 0.2% of the global total, or equivalent to that of Switzerland. According to Politico, even the high-end estimates of bitcoin's total consumption levels amount to only about 6% of the total power consumed by the global banking sector, and even if bitcoin's consumption levels increased 100 fold from today's levels, bitcoin's consumption would still only amount to about 2% of global power consumption. To lower the costs, bitcoin miners have set up in places like Iceland where geothermal energy is cheap and cooling Arctic air is free. Bitcoin miners are known to use hydroelectric power in Tibet, Quebec, Washington (state), and Austria to reduce electricity costs. Miners are attracted to suppliers such as Hydro Quebec that have energy surpluses. According to a University of Cambridge study, much of bitcoin mining is done in China, where electricity is subsidized by the government. =Carbon footprint= Concerns about bitcoin's environmental impact relate bitcoin's energy consumption to carbon emissions. The difficulty of translating the energy consumption into carbon emissions lies in the decentralized nature of bitcoin impeding the localization of miners to examine the electricity mix used. The results of recent studies analyzing bitcoin's carbon footprint vary. A study published in Nature Climate Change in 2018 claims that bitcoin \\"could alone produce enough emissions to push warming above 2 ¬∞C within less than three decades.\\" However, this analysis is subject to strong criticism as the underlying scenarios are considered as inadequate, leading to overestimations. According to studies published in Joule and American Chemical Society in 2019, bitcoin's annual energy consumption results in annual carbon emission ranging from 17 to 22.9 Mt which is comparable to the level of emissions of countries as Jordan and Sri Lanka or Kansas City. International Energy Agency estimates bitcoin's annual carbon emissions to be in a range from 10 to 20 Mt and characterizes the predictions in Nature Climate Change as just \\"sensational predictions about bitcoin\\" echoing the warnings from late 1990s about Internet and its increasing energy consumption. =Ponzi scheme and pyramid scheme concerns= Journalists, economists, investors, and the central bank of Estonia have voiced concerns that bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme. In April 2013, Eric Posner, a law professor at the University of Chicago, stated that \\"a real Ponzi scheme takes fraud; bitcoin, by contrast, seems more like a collective delusion.\\" A July 2014 report by the World Bank concluded that bitcoin was not a deliberate Ponzi scheme. In June 2014, the Swiss Federal Council examined the concerns that bitcoin might be a pyramid scheme; it concluded that, \\"Since in the case of bitcoin the typical promises of profits are lacking, it cannot be assumed that bitcoin is a pyramid scheme.\\" =Security issues= Bitcoin is vulnerable to theft through phishing, scamming, and hacking. , around 980,000 bitcoins have been stolen from cryptocurrency exchanges. =Use in illegal transactions= The use of bitcoin by criminals has attracted the attention of financial regulators, legislative bodies, law enforcement, and the media. Bitcoin gained early notoriety for its use on the Silk Road. The U.S. Senate held a hearing on virtual currencies in November 2013. The U.S. government claimed that bitcoin was used to facilitate payments related to Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Several news outlets have asserted that the popularity of bitcoins hinges on the ability to use them to purchase illegal goods. Nobel-prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz says that bitcoin's anonymity encourages money laundering and other crimes. In 2014, researchers at the University of Kentucky found \\"robust evidence that computer programming enthusiasts and illegal activity drive interest in bitcoin, and find limited or no support for political and investment motives\\". Australian researchers have estimated that 25% of all bitcoin users and 44% of all bitcoin transactions are associated with illegal activity . There were an estimated 24 million bitcoin users primarily using bitcoin for illegal activity. They held $8 billion worth of bitcoin, and made 36 million transactions valued at $72 billion. =Other critical opinions= Fran√ßois R. Velde, Senior Economist at the Chicago Fed, described it as \\"an elegant solution to the problem of creating a digital currency\\". David Andolfatto, Vice President at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, stated that bitcoin is a threat to the establishment, which he argues is a good thing for the Federal Reserve System and other central banks, because it prompts these institutions to operate sound policies. PayPal President David A. Marcus calls bitcoin a \\"great place to put assets\\". Implementation in software Bitcoin Core is free and open-source software that serves as a bitcoin node (the set of which form the bitcoin network) and provides a bitcoin wallet which fully verifies payments. It is considered to be bitcoin's reference implementation. Initially, the software was published by Satoshi Nakamoto under the name \\"Bitcoin\\", and later renamed to \\"Bitcoin Core\\" to distinguish it from the network. It is also known as the Satoshi client. The MIT Digital Currency Initiative funds some of the development of Bitcoin Core. The project also maintains the cryptography library libsecp256k1. =Features= Bitcoin Core includes a transaction verification engine and connects to the bitcoin network as a full node. Moreover, a cryptocurrency wallet, which can be used to transfer funds, is included by default. The wallet allows for the sending and receiving of bitcoins. It does not facilitate the buying or selling of bitcoin. It allows users to generate QR codes to receive payment. The software validates the entire blockchain, which includes all bitcoin transactions ever. This distributed ledger which has reached more than 235 gigabytes in size as of Jan 2019, must be downloaded or synchronized before full participation of the client may occur. Although the complete blockchain is not needed all at once since it is possible to run in pruning mode. A command line-based daemon with a JSON-RPC interface, bitcoind, is bundled with Bitcoin Core. It also provides access to testnet, a global testing environment that imitates the bitcoin main network using an alternative blockchain where valueless \\"test bitcoins\\" are used. Regtest or Regression Test Mode creates a private blockchain which is used as a local testing environment. Finally, bitcoin-cli, a simple program which allows users to send RPC commands to bitcoind, is also included. Checkpoints which have been hard coded into the client are used only to prevent Denial of Service attacks against nodes which are initially syncing the chain. For this reason the checkpoints included are only as of several years ago. A one megabyte block size limit was added in 2010 by Satoshi Nakamoto. This limited the maximum network capacity to about three transactions per second. Since then, network capacity has been improved incrementally both through block size increases and improved wallet behavior. A network alert system was included by Satoshi Nakamoto as a way of informing users of important news regarding bitcoin. In November 2016 it was retired. It had become obsolete as news on bitcoin is now widely disseminated. Bitcoin Core includes a scripting language inspired by Forth that can define transactions and specify parameters. ScriptPubKey is used to \\"lock\\" transactions based on a set of future conditions. scriptSig is used to meet these conditions or \\"unlock\\" a transaction. Operations on the data are performed by various OP_Codes. Two stacks are used - main and alt. Looping is forbidden. Bitcoin Core uses OpenTimestamps to timestamp merge commits. =Development= The original creator of the bitcoin client has described their approach to the software's authorship as it being written first to prove to themselves that the concept of purely peer-to-peer electronic cash was valid and that a paper with solutions could be written. The lead developer is Wladimir J. van der Laan, who took over the role on 8 April 2014. Gavin Andresen was the former lead maintainer for the software client. Andresen left the role of lead developer for bitcoin to work on the strategic development of its technology. Bitcoin Core in 2015 was central to a dispute with Bitcoin XT, a competing client that sought to increase the blocksize. Over a dozen different companies and industry groups fund the development of Bitcoin Core. In popular culture =Literature= In Charles Stross' 2013 science fiction novel, Neptune's Brood, the universal interstellar payment system is known as \\"bitcoin\\" and operates using cryptography. Stross later blogged that the reference was intentional, saying \\"I wrote Neptune's Brood in 2011. Bitcoin was obscure back then, and I figured had just enough name recognition to be a useful term for an interstellar currency: it'd clue people in that it was a networked digital currency.\\" =Film= The 2014 documentary The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin portrays the diversity of motives behind the use of bitcoin by interviewing people who use it. These include a computer programmer and a drug dealer. The 2016 documentary Banking on Bitcoin is an introduction to the beginnings of bitcoin and the ideas behind cryptocurrency today. =Academia= In September 2015, the establishment of the peer-reviewed academic journal Ledger () was announced. It covers studies of cryptocurrencies and related technologies, and is published by the University of Pittsburgh. The journal encourages authors to digitally sign a file hash of submitted papers, which will then be timestamped into the bitcoin blockchain. Authors are also asked to include a personal bitcoin address in the first page of their papers.

Yohai, vice president and sales manager, decided to start making food using their machines after a trip to London, where they had installed automated baking machines for a customer. They first started baking ice cream cones and used the brand name Old London based on their recent experience in that city. Using an investment of $4,000, they created a multimillion-dollar business exclusively using their own capital to expand to include melba toast and snack products. Old London was looking for a new snack in the 1950s and had a machine that could extrude cornmeal under pressure through a narrow hole that would be cut to three-inch lengths by a blade. Baked with orange cheddar cheese and flavorings, Morrie Yohai gave them the name \\"Cheez Doodles\\".Hevesi, Dennis. \\"Morrie Yohai, 90, the Man Behind Cheez Doodles, Is Dead\\", The New York Times, August 2, 2010. Accessed August 3, 2010. The name came to him while he sat around the table with other employees sampling different alternatives for the cheese flavoring.Barrios, Jennifer. \\"Morrie Yohai, 90, helped create Cheez Doodle\\", Newsday, August 1, 2010. Accessed August 3, 2010. By 1960, the company's products were sold in 250,000 supermarkets and restaurants in the United States and their Dipsy Doodles corn chips were the second-best selling corn chip in the country behind Fritos and its snack division produced popcorn in caramel, cheese and unflavored varieties, and was the largest producer of popcorn for home consumption as of 1960. Manhattan's famed Sardi's restaurant included Old London crackers by name on the menu for its \\"executive weight watchers\\" meal. The company was renamed from King Cone Corporation to Old London Foods in May 1960 to take advantage of customer awareness of their product brand label. In 1965, the company was bought out by Borden, which also made Cracker Jack and Drake's cakes. In 1968, Old London opened a bakery in Morris Park, Bronx. The company was long based on East 138th Street in a six-story building in the Bronx, where it ran two shifts year-round and added a third shift during the winter season. Old London had been owned by Corn Products International and was bought out by a group of managers backed by the private equity firm Dubilier & Company. The company was acquired by Nonni Foods, makers of flatbread products, in 2005 for $70 million. By 2010 the company's Old London and Devonsheer brands were sold in 90% of American supermarkets. In February 2010, the company's facility in the northeast Bronx, which housed 228 employees, was shut down and production was relocated to Yadkinville, North Carolina. Nonni Foods is now Chipita America. Chipita formerly known as Nonni Foods The lack of open space in the Bronx building meant that the toasted product had to be moved between floors for different production steps, an issue that would be eliminated with the bigger spaces available to the company in North Carolina.Dwyer, Jim. \\"Toast of the Bronx Will Soon Be Toast\\", The New York Times, February 5, 2010.

Life Hitchcock was born August 23, 1836, in Amherst, Massachusetts. His father was Edward Hitchcock (1793‚Äì1864) who was a professor of geology and natural theology and then president of Amherst College. His mother was Orra White Hitchcock, who illustrated much of his father's work. He graduated from Amherst College in 1856, and considered entering the ministry. He married Martha Bliss Barrows. He was assistant state geologist of Vermont 1857-61 and state geologist of Maine 1861‚Äì62. In 1866 and 1867, Hitchcock studied at the Royal School of Mines in London, examined fossils in the British Museum, and visited glaciers in Switzerland. Hitchcock served as New Hampshire state geologist from 1868 to 1878. His survey produced a three volume report, and an atlas of maps. It was the first set of detailed maps of the geology of the state. In connection with his survey of New Hampshire, he maintained, during the winter of 1870, a meteorological station on Mount Washington, the earliest high-mountain observatory in the United States. He taught at Dartmouth College in 1868 and from 1869 to 1908 held the Hall Professorship of Geology and Mineralogy. He used the tetrahedral hypothesis which had been first published in 1875 by William Lowthian Green to explain the formation of the Earth's land masses. His distant cousin was Harvey Rexford Hitchcock (1800‚Äì1855), who was an early missionary to Hawaii. This led to a publication of a book the volcanoes of Hawaii. Hitchcock was a founder of the Geological Society of America, and in 1883 vice-president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He left a collection of botanical specimens to the University of North Carolina Herbarium. Works * Elementary Geology (1861, with E. Hitchcock) * Mt.

Traditionally in Cajun and other Catholic cultures, worshipers paused three times daily to recite this prayer: at 6 a.m., noon, and 6 p.m. The band explains on its website, \\"Music in the Cajun culture has always been a unifying force - it brings families together on the front porch and at the parish dance. L‚ÄôAngelus is the name of an ancient prayer that, like the music, signifies a coming together of a people. For centuries, Cajuns and their Acadian and French ancestors have bowed their heads to pray as a community whenever they hear the bells ring.\\"http://www.langelus.com/about-langelus.html  References   External links  * http://www.langelus.com Official website Category:Cajun fiddlers Category:Zydeco musicians Category:Musicians from Louisiana Category:American performers of Christian music ","title":"L'Ang√©lus (band)"},{"id":"28249344","text":"Discount Tire Company is an independent tire and wheel retailer. Discount Tire operates in 36 states in the United States, and is the largest independent tire and wheel retailer in the world. The company is headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona. Discount Tire is known as America's Tire in regions of Northern and Central California, including the Greater Los Angeles Area and the Coachella Valley. The only area in California where stores are known as Discount Tire is in San Diego County. Company history Discount Tire was founded in 1960, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, by Bruce T. Halle. After a couple of false starts in other businesses, Halle decided to go into business on his own. He rented an old plumbing supply building on Stadium Boulevard in Ann Arbor. Halle tidied up the place and hung a sign outside that displayed his stock of six tires (two new and four retreads), and waited for new business. It took three days before Halle received his first customer, and four more before he sold his first tire. Halle admitted to having no real business plan in place when he first opened his doors. The company grew to over 200 stores by 1990 and opened its 500th store in 2002. On Sept. 10, 2018 Discount Tire opened its 1000th store, a location in Phoenix, AZ.Company Milestones Retrieved 7 March 2015 Discount Tire entered the northeast market with a location in Pittsburgh, PA in February 2020. Discount Tire grew from a one-man operation into the largest retailer of tires and wheels in the world.Modern Tire Dealer Top 100 for 2014 Retrieved 7 March 2015 Its growth has been largely attributed to the company‚Äôs focus on reasonable prices, customer service, and its satisfaction guarantee. Halle understood that for a company to excel in a commodity market, product differentiation was a non-starter and that improving the customer experience could greatly improve the brand's value to consumers.Rosenbaum, Michael. ‚ÄúSix Tires, No Plan‚Äù. Greenleaf Book Group Press, 2012 Halle attributed the company‚Äôs overall growth and success to its employees, for exhibiting the founder's philosophy: treat people with respect and fairness, always do what is right, care for those in need, work hard, be responsible and have fun. The company built its philosophy around its employees rather than its customers because, as they see it, happy employees make happy customers, not the other way around. Halle taught that success comes from focusing on what each person owes to his family, to future employees and to the next customer coming in the door. Everyone has an unbreakable contract to pay forward to the next customer, the next employee and the next generation. For this reason, Halle promised his employees, \\"Do a good job, and I‚Äôll provide lifelong opportunity for you.\\" That promise resulted in a strict promote-from-within model for the company's management. Marketing In 2005, Discount Tire‚Äôs ‚ÄúThank You‚Äù commercial entered the Guinness World Records as longest continuously running TV commercial. This commercial depicts an old woman played by Maxine Olmstead hurling a tire through a Discount Tire store window as the voice-over says, ‚ÄúIf ever you‚Äôre not satisfied with one of our tires, please feel free to bring it back.

Lacking a buttstock or buffer tube, the OA-93 disperses recoil through a specially designed flat top upper receiver similar to the Armalite AR-18. The passage of the 1994 Crime Bill however required Olympic Arms to perform modifications to the basic design to continue selling them. The first revision to the OA-93 was the OA-96 in which a 30-round ammunition well is pinned and welded in place so that it cannot be detached. In addition, the OA-96 has a button in the rear which opens the upper receiver and can then be loaded via stripper clips. This was followed two years later by the OA-98 which used a detachable magazine but the body was skeletonized to reduce the weight below the 50 ounce restriction to allow the OA-98 to have one more feature to be compliant with the 1994 Crime Bill.

The preserve features a group of cedar glades which harbor rare prairie species, surrounded by forests on all sides. The prairie species are a remnant of a rare ecosystem, which has found refuge on the dry, rocky openings in this part of the state. These grassland openings were probably created by the extinct Megafauna that were once found in the area, although Native American fires may have also played a role in maintaining this landscape. Today, controlled burns are used at Lynx Prairie to keep woody species at bay. Many rare plants are found at Lynx Prairie such as American bluehearts (Buchnera americana), rattlesnake master (Eryngium yuccifolium), crested coralroot (Hexalectris spicata), gladecress (Leavenworthia uniflora), scaly blazing star (Liatris squarrosa), and Texas rock sandwort (Minuartia michauxii var. texana). The southern shrub rusty blackhaw (Viburnum rufidulum) is found in the woods surrounding the prairie. It is approaching the northern limit of its range here and is considered rare in Ohio. Lynx Prairie is owned by The Nature Conservancy and features of trail loops. Parking for the preserve is at East Liberty Church and the trail head is marked at the southeast corner of the cemetery. Emma Lucy Braun was an early advocate for the prairie. Her efforts to protect an initial 22 acres led to the establishment of the Richard & Lucile Durrell Edge of Appalachia Preserve System. In 1967, the Buzzardroost Rock-Lynx Prairie-The Wilderness areas were designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service.

The couple experienced their first business success through the development of a simplified titration method for measuring hardness in drinking water. As the product line expanded to include more parameters and instruments, the company continued to ‚Äúbring analytical chemistry out of the laboratory and put it into the workplace and in the hands of the general public.‚Äù Initially, Kathryn Hach began marketing to municipal drinking water plants through direct mail. The company was originally a partnership. In 1968, it was reincorporated in Delaware as Hach Chemical Co., with Clifford Hach president and treasurer and Kathryn Hach as vice-president.Answers.com Company History Later that year Hach went public, raising $1.7 million with the sale of a small minority of the shares. Most of the money was used to build and equip a new chemical manufacturing plant in Ames. =1970‚Äì1975: expanding boundaries= In 1970, Hach was manufacturing and selling a line of instruments designed to determine specific water impurities. It was also manufacturing a manometric apparatus that measured the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of sewage and industrial wastes in lakes, rivers, and streams. Hach was also manufacturing and selling more than 100 different portable water test kits for laboratory and field use. These kits were employed in water and sewage treatment, water conditioning, cooling towers, wildlife conservation, and boiler water. They usually included specially formulated chemical reagents in the form of small powder packets. Test results were achieved by visual comparison of samples against color standards after adding the prescribed reagents. The directions were designed for people without technical backgrounds to conduct tests. The first of Clifford Hach's 10-item criteria for company products was, \\"Can be used by anyone who can read‚Äù.FundingUniverse.com Company Histories =1977‚Äì1995: restructuring= The demand for testing products grew as legislation was introduced mandating water quality standards, such as the Clean Water Act of 1977. Hach also focused on converting complex analysis into simplified procedures that were reliable and verifiable. These standard methods were compiled into Hach‚Äôs Water Analysis Handbook. In 1977, Clifford Hach took the position of chairman and chief executive officer, and Kathryn Hach became president and chief operating officer the following year. In 1978, Hach moved its instrument division and its corporate headquarters to Loveland, Colorado. Hach Chemical Co. became Hach Company in 1980. In 1985, Clifford Hach was chairman; Kathryn Hach was vice-chairman; and Stelios Papadopoulos was president of the company, which had grown to 580 employees. At that time, the company was being offered for sale at 50 million dollars. Analytical instruments continue to be manufactured in Loveland, Colorado, where Hach also has its corporate headquarters, research, development, and engineering operations, Technical Training Center, and plastic component manufacturing operation. The chemical manufacturing operations, a chemical research laboratory, and the company warehouse and shipping operations are still in Ames, Iowa. =1998 ‚Äì present= In 1998, Hach expanded its portable testing capabilities with the acquisition of Environmental Test Systems Inc., in Elkhart, Indiana (USA). ETS develops, manufactures and markets diagnostic test strips for both consumer and industrial applications. ETS operations continue to be based in Elkhart. In 1999, Hach became a wholly owned subsidiary of Danaher Corporation, which includes over 30 companies working in the process/environmental controls industries. Also in 1999, the company acquired the German manufacturer Lange, and established additional product development and manufacturing in D√ºsseldorf. Lange, founded by Dr. Bruno Lange, is the distribution and support center for Hach's customers in Europe and Mediterranean Africa. Danaher acquired Lange, Hach, and numerous other brands, and a period of dramatic change occurred for each brand as lean production was introduced. After 9/11 Hach began developing products for the emerging field of water distribution system security. In 2002, Hach formed a separate research and development division, Hach Homeland Security Technologies.About Homeland Security Technologies Hach HST‚Äôs scientists and engineers set about developing a water distribution security system designed to detect and alarm operators to contaminants and accidents in real time. The result of their efforts was the first early warning system for drinking water designated and certified by the Department of Homeland Security. In 2007, Hach created TNTplus, vials that contain premeasured reagent, and allow sample reaction and reading in a closed container. The next year, ISO 21501-compliant particle counters were added.

She was named the 2020-2021 ACM Athena Lecturer recognising her contributions to artificial intelligence, notably to multiagent systems, human-agent interaction, autonomous agents and nonmonotonic reasoning, in addition to exemplary service and leadership in these fields, . Biography Sarit Kraus was born in Jerusalem, Israel. She completed her Ph.D. in Computer Science at Hebrew University in 1989 under the supervision of Prof. Daniel Lehmann. She is married to Prof. Yitzchak Kraus and has five children. Academic career Kraus has made highly influential contributions to numerous subfields, most notably to multiagent systems (including people and robots) and non-monotonic reasoning. One of her important contributions is to strategic negotiation. Her work in this area is one of the first to integrate Game Theory with Artificial Intelligence. Furthermore, she started new research on automated agents that negotiate with people, and established that these agents must be evaluated via experiments with humans. In particular, she has developed Diplomat, the first automated agent that negotiated proficiently with people. This was followed with other agents that interact well with people by integrating qualitative decision- making approach with machine learning tools, to face the challenge of people being bounded rational. Based on Kraus‚Äôs work, others have begun to develop automated agents that negotiate and interact with people. Consequently, Kraus‚Äôs work has become the gold standard for research in negotiation, both among automated agents and between agents and humans. This work has provoked the curiosity of other communities and was published in journals of political science, psychology and economics. Another influential contribution of Kraus is in introducing a dimension of individualism into the multi-agent field by developing protocols and strategies for cooperation among self-interested agents including the formation of coalitions. This view differed radically from the fully cooperative agents approach, commonly held then by the multi- agent community (then called Distributed Artificial Intelligence). Individualism is necessary for reliably constraining the behaviour in open environments, such as electronic marketplaces. Together with Barbara J. Grosz of Harvard, Kraus developed a reference theory for collaborative planning (a TeamWork model) called SharedPlans, which provides specification for the design of collaboration-capable agents and a framework for identifying and investigating fundamental questions about collaboration. It specifies the minimal conditions for a group of agents to have a joint goal, the group and individual decision making procedures that are required, the way the agents' mental states and plans can evolve over time and other various important relationships among the agents, e.g., teammates, subcontractors, etc. Given the extensiveness of SharedPlans and its rigorous specifications, it has been the basis for many other works and was widely adopted in other fields (e.g. robotics or human-machine interaction). Kraus is also highly recognized for her contribution to the area of Non-Monotonic Reasoning. She is the first author of one of the most influential papers in the area (KLM). Within the mainstream logic community, ‚ÄúKLM‚Äù semantics have had probably the greatest impact. According to her DBLP entry Kraus has 131 collaborators from all around the world and from different disciplines. She is the author of a monograph on negotiations and co-author of additional two books. Kraus‚Äô solutions have enriched the research community, but also bear practical fruits. Her research has induced the design and construction of real-world systems, which have transformed concepts from academia into reality. Kraus, together with Tambe and Ordonez from USC, developed an innovative approach of randomized policies for security applications. The innovative algorithm, which combines game theory and optimization methods, improves the state-of-the-art in security of robotics and multi-agent systems, and is used in practice at the Los Angeles International Airport since 2007. Her seminal research in the area of formal models of collaboration is used in industrial cutting-edge simulation technology and team-supported tools. Her work in developing Sheba‚Äôs virtual speech therapist is currently being used for treatment by several Israeli HMOs. The Colored Trails game environment that she developed together with Grosz of Harvard provides a platform for researchers to conduct decision- making studies and is now used extensively by researchers from dozens of universities, as well as for training astronauts. Additional exciting recent projects of hers include building systems that negotiate and argue proficiently with people: her research on culture-sensitive agents has resulted in the development of numerous agents for cross-culture collaboration, with provable success in interaction with hundreds of people in America, the Far East and the Middle East---all believing that they interacted with a person, not recognizing that it was actually an agent. Her work on virtual humans has led to the development of a system for the Israeli police for training law enforcement officials to interview witnesses and suspects. Here, virtual psychological models of the suspect were developed, leading to diversified answers by the virtual suspect. Recently, she has developed an intelligent agent which supports an operator that works with a team of low- cost autonomous robots. Finally, together with the Israeli GM center, a persuasion system has been developed that generates advice for drivers regarding various different decisions involving conflicting goals.

It is located in Raphoe, County Donegal and is dedicated to Saint Eunan (Adomn√°n of Iona) (627/8 ‚Äì 704) who was abbot of Iona (679‚Äì704). The other diocesan cathedral is St Columb's Cathedral in Derry. History The oldest substantive part of the present building is the south- east corner, which dates back to the 12th century, although two pieces of a sculptured door lintel dating from around the 9th century are believed to be from the original monastery and church of Raphoe, as founded by St Eunan. The rest of the cathedral is a mixture of successive rebuilding and alterations dating from the 17th to late 19th centuries. The original building was cruciform in shape. A virtual re-building of the medieval cathedral was directed by The Rt. Rev. Dr. George Montgomery from around 1605. Montgomery had been chaplain to King James I, and was nominated not only Bishop of Raphoe, but of Clogher and Derry at the same time. After centuries of modifications and restorations, much of the current building dates from the 1730s. The entrance is by the porch under the tower built in 1738 by Bishop Forster (1716-1744). By the 1870s, the building had again become shabby and neglected. It attracted the unfavourable criticism of many church people and ecclesiologists and one high church architect, Sir Thomas Drew, described the cathedral as \\"the most neglected church in the diocese though situated in the richest part of Donegal.\\" In 1892, Drew was commissioned to begin a plan of restoration which, commenced in 1893, uncovered much of the medieval fabric while \\"medievalizing\\" the greater part of the rest of the building. This restoration, funded by the Knox family, involved partial rebuilding which also saw the transepts largely absorbed into the main line of the church, so that it has a long narrow form, and added much stained glass, and a decorative western doorway. The cathedral shares the characteristic of many medieval church buildings, where larger bodies of clergy offered more elaborate liturgies, in that the quire or chancel is longer than the nave. Medieval features still extant include a bishop's seat (sedilla), shamrock-topped columns, a piscina and an early vestry window. There is a tall square tower at the western end. Related remains Near the cathedral building are the remnants of a consistorial court building and a large bishop's palace.

It is the second adaptation of Susan Hill's 1983 novel of the same name, which was previously filmed in 1989. The film stars Daniel Radcliffe, Ciar√°n Hinds, Janet McTeer, Sophie Stuckey, and Liz White. The plot, set in early 20th-century England, follows a young recently widowed lawyer who travels to a remote village where he discovers that the vengeful ghost of a scorned woman is terrorising the locals. The film was produced by Hammer Film Productions, Alliance Films, Cross Creek Pictures and the UK Film Council. A film adaptation of Hill's novel was announced in 2009, with Goldman and Watkins attached to the project. During July 2010, Radcliffe was cast in the lead role of Arthur Kipps. The film was planned to be shot in 3D before plans were scrapped. Principal photography took place from September to December 2010 across England. Post-production lasted until June 2011. It attracted controversy after receiving a 12A certificate from the British Board of Film Classification, despite several cuts being made. The Woman in Black premiered at the Royal Festival Hall in London before being theatrically released in North America on 3 February 2012 by CBS Films and Alliance Films and in the United Kingdom on 10 February 2012 by Momentum Pictures. The film received generally positive reviews with critics praising Radcliffe's performance, cinematography, direction, atmosphere and homages to Hammer's gothic horror films, calling it a \\"solid ghost story\\". It was also commercially successful, grossing $129 million worldwide. A sequel, The Woman in Black: Angel of Death, was released on 2 January 2015, without the involvement of Radcliffe, Watkins or Goldman. Plot In an English village, Crythin Gifford, in 1889, three girls are having a tea party. They suddenly look up at something off-screen and, appearing entranced, jump to their deaths from the bedroom window. In Edwardian era London 1906, the wife of lawyer Arthur Kipps dies in childbirth. Four years later, Arthur is instructed to visit Crythin Gifford to retrieve any documents left by Alice Drablow, the deceased owner of Eel Marsh House, an isolated and desolate estate on the marshland, as a prelude to the sale of the house. Upon arrival, Arthur finds the villagers unwelcoming, though he finds sympathy in wealthy local landowner Samuel Daily who invites him to dinner. The next morning, Arthur meets Mr. Jerome who tries to hurry him away from the village. Undeterred, Arthur travels to Eel Marsh House. There, he is distracted by odd noises, a bolted nursery, and a spectral entity in funerary garb. He hears sounds on the marshes of a carriage and a screaming child, but sees nobody on the causeway. He later tries to alert the village constable who dismisses his concerns. Two children enter the station with their sister Victoria, who has ingested lye, but she dies almost immediately. That night, Sam reveals that he and his wife Elisabeth lost their young son to drowning. Elisabeth suffers from fits of hysteria which she attributes to her son speaking through her. When Sam attempts to take Arthur to Eel Marsh the next day a gang of local men drive them off. Victoria's father blames Arthur for her death, as Arthur saw \\"that woman\\" at Eel Marsh. At the house, Arthur uncovers correspondence between Alice and her sister Jennet Humfry. Jennet demands to see her son Nathaniel whom the Drablows have formally adopted and barred her from contacting due to her being mentally unfit to care for him, which she denies. A death certificate reveals Nathaniel drowned in a carriage accident on the marsh. Jennet writes that she blames Alice for saving only herself and leaving Nathaniel's body in the marsh. Another death certificates shows that Jennet hanged herself from a beam in the nursery, vowing never to forgive Alice. That night Arthur hears noises from the nursery, which is now unlocked. From the nursery window Arthur sees a boy crawling out of the ground and walking towards the house. He goes outside and sees dead children in the marshes, Victoria among them. Back in the house he sees an apparition of a woman hanging herself. Sam picks Arthur up the next morning. In town, Jerome's house catches fire with his daughter inside. When Arthur attempts to save her, he sees the Woman in Black goading the girl into burning herself. The townspeople blame Arthur for this death as well. At her son's grave, Elisabeth tells Arthur that the Woman in Black is Jennet, who claims the village children by having them take their lives in penance for her own son being taken. Arthur realizes that his son Joseph, who is coming to Crythin Gifford that night, is Jennet's next victim. In an effort to lift the curse, Arthur and Sam find Nathaniel's body in the marsh, and place it in his nursery, where Arthur lures Jennet to him. Arthur and Sam bury Nathaniel with Jennet, though her voice echoes through the house that she will never forgive the wrongs she suffered. Assuming Jennet pacified, Arthur meets Joseph at the railway station. While bidding farewell to Sam, Arthur sees the Woman in Black lure Joseph onto the tracks. Attempting to save him, both he and Joseph are killed by the oncoming train. Sam, horrified, sees the ghosts of the village children and the Woman in Black. The train passes and Joseph sees a woman in white on the tracks, whom Arthur identifies as his late wife Stella. The family is happily reunited as the Woman in Black looks on.

Production =Development= The film was announced in 2009, with Jane Goldman as screenwriter and later James Watkins as director. Daniel Radcliffe was announced as the actor playing the part of Arthur Kipps on 19 July 2010. Two months later, it was announced that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 2 co-star Ciar√°n Hinds would join Radcliffe along with Janet McTeer as Mr and Mrs Daily respectively. Before filming, Radcliffe saw a psychologist so he could better understand his character. The part of Joseph Kipps was played by Misha Handley, who is Radcliffe's real life godson. =Filming= The film was planned to be shot in 3D, but the idea was later scrapped. Principal photography officially started on 26 September 2010. The next day, Radcliffe was pictured in costume just outside Peterborough, England. In early October the crew was filming in Layer Marney Tower. Filming officially ended on 4 December 2010. The exterior shots of Eel Marsh House were filmed at Cotterstock Hall near Oundle in central England. The fictional Nine Lives Causeway leading to it was filmed at Osea Island in Essex.

For its British release, several changes were made in order to qualify for a 12A certificate: Momentum Pictures, the distributor, arranged to have six seconds cut and for changes to other shots, with some scenes darkened and the sound level reduced on some others. Despite the cuts, the 12A certificate was seen as highly controversial in the United Kingdom, and the British Board of Film Classification received 134 complaints from individuals that the rating was too low, the most complained-about film of 2012 according to BBFC figures. A cinematic re-release in October 2014, including a short clip from the forthcoming sequel The Woman in Black: Angel of Death, was given a higher rating of 15. =Music= The soundtrack for the film was composed by American film composer Marco Beltrami. It received positive reviews and was released as a soundtrack album on 12 March 2012 by Silva Screen Records. Release & Reception =Critical reception= The Woman in Black was met with generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 67%, based on 191 reviews, with an average rating of 6.09/10. The site's critical consensus states, \\"Traditional to a fault, The Woman in Black forwent gore for chills‚Äîalthough it may not provide enough of them for viewers attuned to modern, high-stakes horror.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 62 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". =Box office= During opening weekend, The Woman in Black earned $20 million, the biggest US opening for a Hammer film in all of Hammer history, putting it at second place in the box office, behind Chronicle, which earned about $1 million more. This is significantly more than the $11‚Äì$16.5 million industry analysts predicted it would bring in. By June 2012, The Woman in Black had made $127.7 million worldwide. The film also became the highest-grossing British horror film in 20 years. =Home media= The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on 18 June 2012 in the United Kingdom, and was released in the United States on 22 May 2012. Sequel In April 2012, Hammer Films announced that there would be a sequel to The Woman in Black, which is titled The Woman in Black: Angel of Death. The official plot synopsis is: \\"During World War II, the London bombings force schoolteachers Eve Parkins (Phoebe Fox) and Jean Hogg (Helen McCrory) to evacuate a group of children to Crythin Gifford. When the refugees take shelter at Eel Marsh House, Eve soon comes to realise that they are not alone. The longer they remain there, the more the house's evil spirit threatens the children. With the help of a pilot (Jeremy Irvine), Eve tries to protect the children and uncover the truth of the Woman in Black.\\" The original novel's author Susan Hill helped with the story, with the screenplay written by Jon Croker. In October 2012, Tom Harper was announced as the film's director. In April 2013, it was announced that Jeremy Irvine will play the lead role with rumors of Daniel Radcliffe briefly reprising his role from the first film, however Radcliffe ultimately did not appear in the sequel. It later was announced that Phoebe Fox and Helen McCrory had been cast in the film as well. The film began the shooting process in early 2014. The film was released on 2 January 2015 to moderate box office returns but a generally negative critical response.

Specifically, these cases allow tests of location to be made where the assumption that sample observations arise from populations having a normal distribution can be replaced by the assumption that they arise from a Gaussian scale mixture distribution. The class of Gaussian scale mixture distributions contains all symmetric stable distributions, Laplace distributions, logistic distributions, and exponential power distributions, etc.Andrews, D. and C Mallows, C. (1974) ‚ÄúScale mixtures of normal distributions,‚Äù Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, 36, 99‚Äì102 West, M. (1987) \\"On scale mixtures of normal distributions\\", Biometrika, 74(3), 646-648 Introduce : tGn(x), the counterpart of Student's t-distribution for Gaussian scale mixtures. This means that if we test the null hypothesis that the center of a Gaussian scale mixture distribution is 0, say, then tnG(x) (x ‚â• 0) is the infimum of all monotone nondecreasing functions u(x) ‚â• 1/2, x ‚â• 0 such that if the critical values of the test are u‚àí1(1 ‚àí Œ±), then the significance level is at most Œ± ‚â• 1/2 for all Gaussian scale mixture distributions [tGn(x) = 1 ‚àí tGn(‚àíx),for x < 0]. An explicit formula for tGn(x), is given in the papers in the references in terms of Student‚Äôs t-distributions, tk, k = 1, 2, ‚Ä¶, n. Introduce : Œ¶G(x):= limn ‚Üí ‚àû tGn(x), the Gaussian scale mixture counterpart of the standard normal cumulative distribution function, Œ¶(x). Theorem. Œ¶G(x) = 1/2 for 0 ‚â§ x < 1, Œ¶G(1) = 3/4, Œ¶G(x) = C(x/(2 ‚àí x2)1/2) for quantiles between 1/2 and 0.875, where C(x) is the standard Cauchy cumulative distribution function. This is the convex part of the curve Œ¶G(x), x ‚â• 0 which is followed by a linear section Œ¶G(x) = x/(2) + 1/2 for 1.3136‚Ä¶ < x < 1.4282... Thus the 90% quantile is exactly 4/5. Most importantly, : Œ¶G(x) = Œ¶(x) for x ‚â• . Note that Œ¶() = 0.958‚Ä¶, thus the classical 95% confidence interval for the unknown expected value of Gaussian distributions covers the center of symmetry with at least 95% probability for Gaussian scale mixture distributions. On the other hand, the 90% quantile of Œ¶G(x) is 4/5 = 1.385‚Ä¶ > Œ¶‚àí1(0.9) = 1.282‚Ä¶ The following critical values are important in applications: 0.95 = Œ¶(1.645) = Œ¶G(1.651), and 0.9 = Œ¶(1.282) = Œ¶G(1.386).Bakirov, N.K. and Sz√©kely, G.

Additionally, many characters have different backstories than in Cast a Deadly Spell. For example, Lovecraft refuses to use magic in Cast a Deadly Spell on principle, but in Witch Hunt he refuses because of a bad experience he has had.

Philip Lovecraft (Hopper)‚Äîuses magic every day. Yet, cars, telephones and other modern technology also exist in this world. The year is 1953, at the beginning of the Second Red Scare, but in this universe magic is substituted for communism and the McCarthy-esque proceedings are being run by Senator Larson Crockett (Bogosian). Lovecraft is hired by film star Kim Hudson (Cruz) to dig up dirt on her husband, producer N.J. Gotlieb (Rosenberg), who is about to replace her on his latest film with a young starlet he may be having an affair with. Gaining entry to the studio with the help of practicing witch Hypolita Kropotkin (Ralph), his friend and landlady who is working for the studio, he encounters Finn Macha (Sands), a warlock and former private investigator with whom he had once crossed paths. When Gotlieb is murdered by magic, Senator Crockett uses the crime to make Kropotkin a scapegoat for use in his Anti- Magic crusade and uses newly-passed Congressional legislation to have her sentenced to death by public burning. Lovecraft must now not only save Kropotkin and uncover the real murderer, the motive behind the murder and the secrets Kim Hudson is hiding, but also confront the demons in his own past...a past that includes Finn Macha and the reason why Lovecraft will not use magic.

Its species, A. tommasinii and A. crassicostatus, were described in 1860 and 1993. Though A. crassicostatus is probably a junior synonym for Adriosaurus suessi, A. tommasinii was found to be similar to coniasaurs, mosasauroids, and a sister taxon to modern snakes in 2010. Etymology The primary portion of Acteosaurus' name comes from Actaeon (; Greek: ), a famous Theban hero who was hunted and killed by the goddess Artemis. The second part of the name is the Greek word sauros (œÉŒ±œÖœÅŒøœÇ), which means \\"lizard\\" or \\"reptile\\". The type species was named after the botanist Muzio Giuseppe Spirito de Tommasini (1794‚Äî1879), the Podest√†--or magistrate-- of Trieste under the Habsburgs. Taxonomy Hermann von Meyer (1801-1869) As a genus, Acteosaurus was described in 1860 by German paleontologist Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer. There exist two known species of Acteosaurus: A. crassicostatus and A. tommasinii. The latter is the type species, while A. crassicostatus was discovered in 1993. A 2010 redescription of the type species found \\"monophyly of the clade Ophidiomorpha\\". This included the Dolichosauridae, Pontosaurus, Aphanizocnemus, and Adriosaurus. Acteosaurus was found to be a basal ophidiomorph (similar to Adrisaurus) and sister taxon to the Ophidia, or modern snakes. Description Acteosaurus is described as slender or snake-like, similar to other dolichosaurids. Its shortened forelimbs and long tail help to distinguish it from other genera, and its vertebral column is similar to more modern varanid lizards. The holotype, when it was discovered, was unfortunately missing its head. So, while Meyer was unable to come up with an exact number, he noted that Acteosaurus has at least 10 cervical vertebrae, and 27 dorsals. There are small articular processes on the trunk vertebrae, and it has long, narrow neural spines, and posteroventrally positioned, unfused haemal arches on the vertebrae of the tail. There is no pachyostosis, or bone thickening, in the vertebrae and ribs. The limbs are reduced in size, and though the forelimbs of Acteosaurus are fully developed, they are smaller than the hind limbs. Acteosaurus' pelvic bone is flattened, has square-shaped pubic process, and a rectangular descending ramus. Distribution and habitat The Istrian peninsula Both Acteosaurus tommasinii and A. crassicostatus were found in the upper section of karst Cenomanian platy limestone, in Komen, Slovenia. Komen is part of Istria, a peninsula on the Adriatic sea, and also a section of the Karst Plateau. During the late Cretaceous, most of Europe was an island chain in the Tethys ocean, and Acteosaurus' aquatic nature and similarity to mosasauroids suggests that it lived on the coast of one of these islands.

SAIntS is a British International School offering (i) GCSE, A Level and BTEC qualifications and a wealth of extra-curricular opportunities. History It was founded as a series of mission schools in Limbe, Blantyre and Zomba in Nyasaland (Malawi)in the 1920s just after the First World War. The purpose of the school was to make education available to European students and consisted of children of colonial official, traders, and planters. In an agreement signed in 1937 between the Church of Scotland Mission and the Nyasaland Government in 1938, it officially became St. Andrew's Preparatory School (St. Andrews Primary School) and enrolled 14 students. Three distinct schools With the need to further education, the school split into three parts creating a distinct kindergarten, primary school and a high school in three locations in 1957.(The High School opened on 28 January 1957) Saint Andrews High School The high school came to be known as Saint Andrews High School (SAHS)in 1958. In 1965, a year after Malawian Independence, the school changed its name to \\"St. Andrew's Secondary School\\" (SASS). In 1994, it later changed its name to Saint Andrews International High School (SAIntS) as it is known now to reflect the international and diverse nature of its student body. The demographics of the school include students of Asian, African, American, and European descent. Saint Andrew's International High School (SAIntS) Today, Saints is an exclusive school located in the Nyambadwe suburb of Blantyre, Malawi, and has 520 students from more than 30 nationalities as part of its day and boarding school. The school offers IGCSE, BTEC and A-level qualifications in line with the standard British curriculum. There is a strong emphasis on extra-curricular activities, including sports and a variety of clubs and societies. Most notable amongst these are Football, Rugby, Cricket, Hockey, Swimming, Athletics, Water Polo, Tennis, Squash and the Duke of Edinburgh Award. The school boasts impressive looking grounds, with the school buildings set on a ridge overlooking the sports facilities and adjacent grounds. Cricket ground In November 2019, it was named as one of the venues to host 2019 T20 Kwacha Cup, a Twenty20 International (T20I) cricket tournament. Academics Students study British style curriculum including GCSE/IGCSE, BTECs and A levels. The school has an excellent reputation in both academic and sporting regards ‚Äî with the rivalry between the four houses culminating in the end of year House Cup. St. Andrews focuses its efforts on trying to prepare its students for further studies at international universities including Oxford and Cambridge in England and the Ivy League Universities in the U.S.A. Houses and clubs The school consists of various houses and clubs; such as Chiradzulu, Michiru, Ndirande and Soche, named after the mountains surrounding Blantyre. The Chiradzulu house holds the colour of Yellow, The Michiru house holds the colour of Blue, Ndirande holds the colour of Red and Soche holds the colour of green. These Houses provide a family structure inside the school, in which the students can compete against fellow students in a variety of activities for all age groups and skill levels. Boarding Approximately 80 students are boarders. There are separate boys' and girls' hostels and a dedicated team of boarding supervisors.

It was located around what is today St Nicholas farmhouse at the Steading, between Albany Park and the East Sands Leisure Centre. Of unknown origin, the establishment served as a hospice for lepers outside the town between the beach at East Sands and the old coastal route. Parts of the hospital complex have been excavated in the 20th century, with rumours of a graveyard. Leper house and poor house The hospital lay on the lands of Kinkell, once belonging to the C√©li D√© of St Andrews.Taylor, Place-Names, p. 529 The earliest notices of the leper house appear to date to the late 12th century. Perhaps the earliest record, a grant of 2 oxgangs in Powgavie (near Inchture in Gowrie) by Hugh Giffard, dated between 1178 and 1185.Taylor, Place-Names, p. 528 The other is a grant by Roger de Beaumont (died 1202), bishop of St Andrews, datable 1189 x 1195, granted the house the right to send a cart to the \\"muir of Crail\\" (King's Muir) to obtain heather.Taylor, Place-Names, p. 528, n. 168 Both charters survive in 16th-century confirmations to the Dominican Order, both directly and indirectly from a confirmation of 1540 (Registrum magni sigilli regum Scotorum, vol. iii no. 2032). The same document reveals that St Nicholas also held the land of Peekie and a toft and croft at Lundin (between Leven and Largo).Taylor, Place-Names, pp. 528, 529 The house functioned as a home for lepers until at least March 1438. It is referred to for the last time as a leper house in a document dating to 14 March 1438, but is called a \\"poor house\\" in another document dating to 12 May.Cowan and Easson, Medieval Religious Houses, p. 190 In 1529 it was taken over by the Dominicans, becoming attached to their local house, Blackfriars, St Andrews. It was still in use in 1583, when an endowment of victual was made for its poor. The hospital and its graveyard was located around the farm which became known as St Nicholas' farm (today a bed and breakfast with the dependent buildings converted into houses). The letter-book of James Haldenston, prior of St Andrews, reveals that the township was also called Liberton (\\"Leper toun\\"). The farmer at St Nicholas is said to have discovered 30 bodies in the vicinity of the farmhouse in the late 1950s.RCAHMS, \\"St Andrews, St Nicholas Farm\\" Modern excavations around St Nicholas farmhouse Between November 1986 and March 1987 excavation took place in the area, prior to the construction of the East Sands Leisure Centre and car park. It is thought that the excavation uncovered the western boundary-wall of the hospital with another building (possibly a bakery) built against the wall's east face. Medieval pottery was found, and the building appears to have been levelled in either the 14th or 15th century.Hall, \\"St Nicholas Farm\\", p. 14; Maloney, \\"St Nicholas Farm\\", p. 31; Proudfoot, \\"St Nicholas Farm\\", p. 17 More of the wall was uncovered in 1993,Maloney, \\"St Nicholas Farm\\", p. 31 and in 1994 excavations took place along the Interceptor Sewer Pipeline (between Pipeland Cottage and St Nicholas farmhouse) after a bronze hoard and a few stone axes were found in the area.Proudfoot, \\"St Nicholas Farm\\", p. 21 and \\"St Andrews Interceptor Pipeline\\", pp. 20-21 Two trenches at the farm revealed animal bones, pottery fragments, and an 18th or 19th century field drain.Proudfoot, \\"St Nicholas Farm\\", p. 21 In February and March 1997 more excavations uncovered a wall of a large building with 16th-century green-glazed pottery, along with a smaller wall, perhaps coming from 16th- or 17th-century redevelopment.Stronach, \\"St Nicholas Farm\\", p. 41; Toolis, \\"St Nicholas Farm\\", p. 41 Further archaeological activity in 1999, in advance of the construction of a nursery south of the Leisure Centre and south-west of the 1987 area, unearthed a cobbled road and bones from four humans who lived 1530 x 1310 BC, 130 x 390 AD, 430 x 650 AD, and 530 x 660 AD.Hall, \\"St Nicholas Farm\\", p. 48 Notes References    * * Category:12th-century establishments in Scotland Category:History of Fife Category:Leper hospitals Category:Religion in Fife Category:Religious organizations established in the 12th century Category:St Andrews Category:Scottish medieval hospitals and almshouses Category:Defunct hospitals in Scotland ","title":"St Nicholas Hospital, St Andrews"},{"id":"28250509","text":"Recovery coaching is a form of strengths-based support for people with addictions or in recovery from alcohol, other drugs, codependency, or other addictive behaviors. They work with people who have active addictions, as well as those already in recovery. Recovery coaches are helpful for making decisions about what to do with one's life and the part addiction or recovery plays in it. They help clients find ways to stop addiction (abstinence), or reduce harm associated with addictive behaviors. These coaches can help a client find resources for harm reduction, detox, treatment, family support and education, local or online support groups; or help a client create a change plan to recover on their own. Recovery coaches do not offer primary treatment for addiction, do not diagnose, and are not associated with any particular method or means of recovery. They support any positive change, helping persons coming home from treatment to avoid relapse, build community support for recovery, or work on life goals not related to addiction such as relationships, work, or education. Recovery coaching is action-oriented with an emphasis on improving present life and reaching future goals. Recovery coaching is unlike most therapy because coaches do not address the past, do not work to heal trauma, and put little emphasis on feelings. Recovery coaches are unlike licensed addiction counselors in that they are non-clinical and do not diagnose or treat addiction or any mental health issues. Relationship to life coaching Similar to life and business coaching, recovery coaching uses a partnership model wherein the client is considered to be the expert on his or her life, the one who decides what is worth doing, and the coach provides expertise in supporting successful change. Recovery coaching focuses on achieving goals important to the client, not just recovery-related goals. The coach asks questions and offers reflections to help the client reach clarity and decide what steps to take. Recovery coaching emphasizes honoring values and making principle-based decisions, creating a clear plan of action, and using current strengths to reach future goals. The coach provides accountability to help the client stay on track. Other similar terms The moniker \\"recovery coach\\" is used for a variety of specific addiction support roles. The main distinction is between the professional or highly compensated recovery coach and the volunteer or agency-employed peer recovery support specialist. Recovery support roles include the following: =Sober escort= A sober escort, or travel escort, is a paid sober travel companion or travel escort that accompanies a client to an event, to treatment, or to court, to ensure the client maintains sobriety. Transportation can be a significant challenge to a newly abstinent person. Whether the client is interested in maintaining an ongoing recovery or just needs to stay abstinent for a period of time, getting from point A to point B can be difficult. This version of a recovery coach may be required to transport a person in recovery across town, across the state, or across the county. = Sober companion= A sober companion or sober coach works full-time with the client: full work days, nights, weekends or extended periods where the coach is by the client's side 24 hours a day. This long-term option can begin with treatment discharge and may develop into a coaching relationship that continues for several weeks, months or longer. When returning home from treatment, the client trades a secure, drug-free environment for a situation where they know there are problems. The sober companion may provide the symbolic and functional safety of the treatment center. This coach will introduce the client to 12-step meetings, guide them past former triggers for their addiction, and support them in developing a recovery plan. The sober companion helps the client make lifestyle changes in order to experience a better quality of life in the first crucial days after discharge from a treatment center. Sometimes a recovery coach is necessary to keep a client sober in order to regain custody of a child. =Recovery support specialist= A recovery support specialist (RSS) or a peer recovery support specialist (PRSS) is a non-clinical person who meets with clients in a recovery community organization or goes off-site to visit a client. They may volunteer for these coaching services, or be employed by a recovery community organization for a low wage. The recovery support specialist ensures there is a contract for engagement, called a personal recovery plan. This is a key component of the recovery management model, which all RSSs follow. These specialists are sometimes also called \\"recovery coaches\\". William L. White, researcher and original author of the recovery management model, uses the term \\"recovery support specialist\\". This is referenced in the paper titled \\"Recovery Oriented System of Care (ROSC) Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Glossary of Terms\\", compiled by the Bureau of Substance Abuse and Addiction Services (BSAAS).http://www.williamwhitepapers.com/pr/ROSC%20Michigan%20Glossary%20of%20Terms.pdf ‚àí 75.0kb Another term for a peer recovery support specialist is \\"peer mentor\\". =Family recovery coach= The family plays an important role for a person in recovery but is often neglected by traditional models of recovery. Specially trained family recovery coaches strive to create a calm, objective, non- judgmental environment for the family of a recovering addict. They are knowledgeable in specific models that help the family cope with the changes that they have gone through living with an active addict or living with a recovering addict. Regardless of an addict's choices, working with a family recovery coach may help a spouse, partner, or loved ones avoid the mental obsession that plagues many families affected by addiction and learn to lead sane and productive lives.Buncher, 2012 =Phone or virtual recovery coach= A phone or virtual recovery coaching relationship may be established to continue beyond the face-to-face meeting of a client and a recovery coach. Today, many treatment centers are embracing virtual recovery coaching, and linking phone or virtual recovery coaches with clients prior to leaving treatment, as a way to continue the connection to the treatment center, as well as meeting the guidelines of an aftercare program. Online virtual coaching programs also exist, either fee-based or for free, that will help anyone apply the methods of recovery (e.g. developing a recovery plan and building recovery capital), whether the client has completed a stay at a treatment center or has relapsed many months after treatment. =Legal support specialist= Lawyers dealing with criminal drug cases or drug courts sometimes request a type of recovery coaching to ensure a client (perhaps under house arrest, enrolled in a drug court outpatient program or pending trial) stays sober as per the law's mandate. Recovery coaches with the required certification and legal knowledge are contracted for this purpose. Certified Peer Recovery Support Specialists, Licensed clinical social workers or certified alcohol and drug counselors with training in assessments can perform these tasks. The court will request them to perform a client assessment and work with the client on a continuing basis and re-assess after a period of time. The coach will then draft a letter to the court and offer suggested placement in a residential alcohol/drug treatment center, an outpatient treatment program, or a sober living facility. A legal support specialist can also appear in court with the client and provide transportation to or from the courthouse. =In the emergency departments of hospitals= The AnchorED program, developed in 2014 with a group of Rhode Island hospitals and the Anchor Community Recovery Center in Providence RI, was launched in an attempt to reduce the instance of accidental opioid overdose by connecting overdose patients with Certified Recovery Coaches in the emergency departments of regional hospitals. The AnchorED program is now a benchmark in this field and is used nationwide. This program is meant to connect people experiencing an overdose, or revived from an overdose in the ED in the hospital emergency departments with peer-to-peer recovery support. Specially trained ED Peer Recovery Specialists are on call to all Emergency Departments 24/7 and called in when individuals are transported to a hospital emergency department having survived an opiate overdose. The hours immediately after an overdose are medically risky, but they also present a unique opportunity. The AnchorED trained recovery coaches will make sure that patients and their families know that substance use disorder is a medical condition and that recovery is possible. Recovery Coaches engage with those who have survived an opiate overdose, listen and be present to answer questions patients may have about recovery supports or treatment options. These coaches also provide recovery and treatment information to family members. These same coaches offer post- discharge recovery contact and support to the revived patients for a period of weeks.SAMSHA Recovery to Practice, Thomas F. Joyce LCDP, CPRS, Bryan Bailey, BSN, RN -PowerPoint Presentation on Supporting Recovery in Acute Care and Emergency Settings- https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/programs_campaigns/recovery_to_practice/supporting- recovery-in-acute-care-emergency-settings.pdf History Alida Schuyler, a coach credentialed by the International Coach Federation (ICF), who was in recovery from addiction, wrote the first recovery coach certification training program specifically aimed at training students to coach people with addictions. She also created the first special interest group for recovery coaches, and she co-founded the nonprofit Recovery Coaches International with Andrew Susskind.\\"Early History of RCI\\" by Doreen Cardwell, Recovery Coaching Times, Winter 2010 William L. White used the term \\"recovery coach\\" in his 2006 paper \\"Sponsor, Recovery Coach, Addiction Counselor\\", but later adopted the term \\"peer recovery support specialist\\" to emphasize a community-based peer model of addiction support. White's Recovery Management model, adapted from the Minnesota Model, includes recovery coaching (peer recovery support specialist) and was developed in 2006.White, William, Kurtz, Ernest, & Sanders, Mark (2006). Recovery Management, Behavioral Health and Mental Retardation Services, and the Great Lakes Addiction Technology Transfer Center, Chicago IL. Many recovery coaches use different recovery approaches adapted from the Minnesota Model. Schuyler developed a professional model of life coaching for addiction recovery by blending the Minnesota Model and Harm Reduction model with the core competencies of the ICF. Through the research of White, David Loveland, Ernest Kurtz, and Mark Saunders, and the efforts funded through Faces and Voices of Recovery, the Fayette Companies, Great Lakes Addiction Technology Transfer Center, the Chestnut Health Systems and many other universities, research on recovery coaching is progressing rapidly. The theory has been developed that recovery coaching reduces relapse by providing ongoing support developing healthy problem-solving skills and self efficacy (reaching worthwhile goals), as well as connecting with the local recovery community for additional support. In other words, recovery coaching helps the client develop the cognitive skills necessary for considering options and consequences, making clear choices, planning, and taking actions toward a healthier life and recovery goals. Recovery coaching is currently offered by some notable 12-step treatment centers as well as several private \\"academies\\" and \\"institutes\\" with certifications that are usually country and/or state specific. Be sure to check local laws for compliance. In 2013, the first self- help book offering recovery coaching techniques to help people rebuild their lives after addiction was published. The Happy Addict: How to be Happy in Recovery from Alcoholism or Drug Addiction (), authored by Recovery Coach Beth Burgess, was released by Eightball Publishing in July 2013. Addiction recovery support groups Recovery coaches encourage (but most do not require) participation in groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Al- Anon, or non 12-step groups such as LifeRing Secular Recovery, SMART Recovery, Moderation Management, and Women for Sobriety. They also work with individuals who dislike groups to help them find their own path to recovery. Niches within recovery coaching Recovery coaches may work with any type of addict. There are also niches within recovery coaching such as those who work exclusively with families of recovering individuals, or a financial coach who works on rebuilding an overspender's credit rating. Many peer recovery support specialists work with individuals who have left the prison system and are attempting to rebuild their lives. Some recovery coaches specialize in emotional and financial recovery after divorce. A few recovery coaches specialize in merging the characteristics of recovery coaching within a life coaching framework. This concept takes into account the often overlooked reality that those in early recovery tend to have unique difficulties in applying the realities of day-to-day living within their new sober lifestyle. Such unique coaching styles are able to span far beyond the recovery component and properly introduce outside influencers, such as family relationships, employment, schooling, and relationships,. For those requiring a higher level of care, such as medical detoxification for heroin or opiate withdrawal, or 24/7 sober companion and oversight services, there exist recovery coaching firms which specialize in providing what could often be described as an alternative to inpatient or outpatient treatment. Companies like The Addictions Coach and others which have nationwide credentials are able to essentially bring the addiction treatment component to the client, no matter where he or she may be located. What recovery coaches do Recovery coaches support the client in achieving and maintaining a solid foundation in recovery, and building upon recovery to achieve other life goals that make recovery worthwhile. David Loveland and Michael Boyle wrote a lengthy manual on recovery coaching and how to guide an individual through creating their recovery plan.Loveland, David, PhD, Boyle, Michael, MA., Manual for Recovery Coaching and Personal Recovery Plan Development, Chicago, IL, Fayette Companies working on a grant from the Illinois Department of Human Services, Department of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse, June 6, 2005 William White, preeminent scholar on addictions, worked closely with the Philadelphia community-based recovery center PRO-ACT to prepare a document outlining the \\"Ethical Guidelines for the Delivery of Peer-Based Recovery Support Services\\". These documents provide a discussion of what a recovery coach does. Also included in these guidelines are the definition of coaching roles as they relate to others in the realm of personal conduct and conduct in service relationships with the community service provider or treatment team. White's document presents a simple statement of core competencies.White, William, (2007). Ethical Guidelines for the Delivery of Peer Based Support Services Faces and Voices of Recovery.org.

The prototype, registered as a Canadian basic ultralight as C-IRCA, first flew in July 1984. The Nieuport 11 is constructed from 6061-T6 aluminum tubing, supported with 2024-T3 aluminum gussets, held together with blind rivets. At one point welded steel tube fuselages were also available. The wings, tail and fuselage are then covered with doped aircraft fabric. Landing gear is conventional, with spoked mainwheels with bungee suspension. The original design calls for a tailskid, the same as the World War One original aircraft, but since the skid is impractical on hard surfaced runways, a tailwheel is optional. The engine cowling is a horseshoe shaped semi-circular design. Recommended engines for the aircraft include the Rotax 447, the Rotax 503, Volkswagen air-cooled engines and various Hirth engines. The designer estimated that the Nieuport 11 would take 400 hours to construct. The aircraft have been described as being \\"very easy to fly, even by novice pilots.\\" By 2015 over 1200 sets of plans had been sold.Tacke, Willi; Marino Boric; et al: World Directory of Light Aviation 2015-16, page 104.

The main elections were held on 26 March and a second round on 9 April. They were the first partially free nationwide elections held in the Soviet Union, and would prove to be the final national elections held as the country ceased to exist in 1991. The elections were followed by regional elections in 1990, the last legislative elections to take place in the country. Background In January 1987, Mikhail Gorbachev, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), announced the new policy of demokratizatsiya (democratization). Under this concept the electorate would have a choice between multiple candidates per constituency, although all candidates would still have to be members of the CPSU. The concept was introduced by Gorbachev to enable him to circumvent the CPSU hardliners who resisted his perestroika and glasnost reform campaigns, while still maintaining the Soviet Union as a one-party communist state. In December 1988, the 1977 Soviet Constitution was amended to create a new legislative body, the Congress of People's Deputies (CPD), to replace the old Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The Congress of People's Deputies consisted of 2,250 deputies. 750 deputies (one third) were reserved for the CPSU and its affiliated organizations, however, the remaining two-thirds would be elected under the principles of demokratizatsiya, with 750 under the system of the old Soviet of the Union (one deputy per 300,000 citizens) and 750 under the system of the old Soviet of Nationalities (an equal number of deputies for each of the fifteen Union Republics). Elections for the new legislature were set for March 1989. The elections Culture Hall is prepared for legislative election in Pereslavl (1989) While the majority of CPSU-endorsed candidates were elected (84 percent of the Congress consisted of the CPSU candidates by Gorbachev's estimate), over 300 candidates won out over the endorsed candidates. Among them were Boris Yeltsin, who won over the CPSU-endorsed candidate to represent Moscow's district with 89% of the vote. It was Yeltsin's first return to political power after resigning from the Politburo in 1987. On a union republic level Yeltsin was also later elected to the RSFSR's Congress and then, indirectly, to its Supreme Soviet. Anti-corruption prosecutor Telman Gdlyan, trapeze artist Valentin Dikul, ethnographer Galina Starovoytova, lawyer Anatoly Sobchak, physicist Andrei Sakharov, weightlifter Yury Vlasov, and hockey player Anatoli Firsov were among the other non-endorsed candidates who were elected to the CPD. All in all, while the majority of seats were won by endorsed candidates, one Politburo member, five Central Committee members, and thirty five regional CPSU chiefs lost re-election to non-endorsed candidates. Gorbachev hailed the elections as a victory for perestroika and the election was praised in state media such as TASS and Izvestia, despite the strong opposition of hardliners within the Politburo and Central Committee. Aftermath The first session of the new Congress of People's Deputies opened in late May 1989. Although hardliners retained control of the chamber, the reformers used the legislature as a platform to debate and criticize the Soviet system, with the state media broadcasting their comments live and uncensored on television. Yeltsin managed to secure a seat on the reconstituted Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and in the summer formed the first opposition, the Inter-Regional Deputies Group, formed of Russian nationalists and liberals. As it was the final legislative group in the Soviet Union, those elected in 1989 played a vital part in continuing reforms and the eventual fall of the Soviet Union two years later.

In contrast with typical textbook models, these large-scale macroeconometric models used large amounts of data and based forecasts on past correlations instead of theoretical relations. These models estimated the relations between different macroeconomic variables using regression analysis on time series data. These models grew to include hundreds or thousands of equations describing the evolution of hundreds or thousands of prices and quantities over time, making computers essential for their solution. While the choice of which variables to include in each equation was partly guided by economic theory (for example, including past income as a determinant of consumption, as suggested by the theory of adaptive expectations), variable inclusion was mostly determined on purely empirical grounds. Large-scale macroeconometric model consists of systems of dynamic equations of the economy with the estimation of parameters using time-series data on a quarterly to yearly basis. Macroeconometric models have a supply and a demand side for estimation of these parameters. Kydland and Prescott call it the system of equations approach. Large-scale macroeconometric model can be defined as a set of stochastic equations with definitional and institutional relationships denoting the behaviour of economic agents. The supply side determines the steady state properties of the macroeconometric model. The macroeconometric model designed by the model builder is significantly influenced by his interests, information, purpose behind its construction, time and financial constraints in the research. The size and nature of the model will change because of the above considerations while building the same. According to Pesaran and Smith the macroeconometric model must have three basic characteristics viz. relevance, adequacy and consistency. Relevance means the model must be according to the requirements of the desired output. Consistency will expect the model to be inline with the existing theory and inner working of the described system. Adequacy explains the model to be better in terms of its predictive performance. The main objective of the model decides its size. In the current scenario there is an increasing interest in the use of these large-scale macroeonometric models for theory evaluation, impact analysis, policy simulation and forecasting purposes.http://www.arts.pdn.ac.lk/econ/ejournal/v1/v1-ananda-jayawickreme- article.pdf Large-scale macroeconometric models were criticized by Robert Lucas in his critique. Lucas argued that models should be based on theory, not on empirical correlations. He said that empirical correlations were sensitive to policy changes, and only a model based on theory could account for shifting policy environments. Lucas and other new classical economists were especially critical of the use of large-scale macroeconometric models to evaluate policy impacts when they were purportedly sensitive to policy changes. Tinbergen developed the first comprehensive national model, which he first built for the Netherlands and later applied to the United States and the United Kingdom after World War II.

A year later she permanently moved in with her great uncle and adopted father, mid twentieth century painter, Joseph Allworthy, who referred to her as a \\"born painter\\", with the deal that 'she use his studio, and develop her career as an artist, under his watchful eye'.\\"Chicago Tribune\\", 10 July 1980. =Career= Paintings Allworthy has established herself as a still life, figure and landscape painter. She has built a reputable portrait career as well. She takes great pride in painting from life, \\"I enjoy portraits... I wait and watch for a detail I like, something that is typical of them, like doing something nice with their hands...\\" something that makes her work unique and keeps true to her love and respect for the traditional style of painting and distinctive from modern photographic realism. Her subjects include prominent figures in business, politics and academia. \\"...her landscapes always include an element of human activity... such as an overturned wheel barrow... The significance of this observation leads the viewer to account for the missing activity at the time of creating the painting.\\" \\"Like all of her paintings, strictly from life, she is compelled to remain captive to time, natural light...\\".Beam, Michael J.. \\"Mitchell Museum of Cedarhurst\\". 14 June 2003.

Boydell & Brewer ) was an ascetic hermit and monk from the Bierzo region of Visigothic Spain. A number of his writings still survive, including three short autobiographical works in which he complains about his many sufferings. Life Valerio was a member of the Visigothic aristocracy.Anastasia Serghidou, (2007), Fear of slaves, fear of enslavement in the ancient Mediterranean, page 301. Presses Univ. Franche-Comt√© In his writings Valerio describes how, after an eventful youth, he retired from the world seeking a more spiritual life. During one period he was a monk at the Monastery of Compludo, but this he abandoned in favour of a \\"desert hermitage\\" outside the city of Astorga, Spain.Maribel Dietz, (2005), Wandering monks, virgins, and pilgrims: ascetic travel in the Mediterranean, pages 183-4, Penn State Press After falling out with a local priest, some well-wishers built a church for him on an estate called Ebronanto where he lived as a hermit in a cell by the altar, receiving food and other supplies from the family owning the estate.Roger Collins, (2004), Visigothic Spain, 409-711, page 201-2. Wiley-Blackwell However, the head of this estate, a man called Ricimer, pulled the church down and built a new one, apparently with the intent of employing Valerio as a priest. But Valerio saw this as an attack by the devil, intent on destroying his reclusive life, and he was only spared when the church fell down and killed Ricimer. Later in life he was joined in another hermitage by his nephew and a servant, and the three men built a small church on the hillside next to their cells. Valerio was connected in some way with the Abbey of San Pedro de Montes; he wrote for the monks there, and later writers mistakenly assumed that he had been abbot.\\"Valerio of Bierzo\\" entry in New Catholic Encyclopedia, (2003) An inscription, extant in the church of San Pedro, calls him \\"sanctus\\" (saint), which at that time was simply a title of honor. Works A number of short works by Valerio survive. These works include: three brief accounts of visions of the afterlife as seen by three monks; a summary of a journey to the Holy Land by the fourth-century ascetic Egeria;Roger Collins, (1995), Early medieval Spain: unity in diversity, 400-1000, page 85. Palgrave Macmillan. some short works of monastic instruction; and a small body of poetry. Of particular historical value are three short autobiographical works which describe the difficulties and persecutions to which he was subjected at the hands of the local clergy and populace. These autobiographies particularly emphasize his sufferings, many of which he regarded as being directly inflicted by the devil. One short hagiographical work known as the Vita Fructuosi (Life of Fructuosus of Braga), was from the 16th to the mid 20th century wrongly thought to have been written by Valerio.Francis Clark, (2003), The \\"Gregorian\\" dialogues and the origins of Benedictine monasticism, page 353.

Known as Old Solomons Island Road, the state highway runs from MD 2 near Owings north to MD 261 at Friendship. MD 778 and its unsigned auxiliary routes are segments of the old alignment of MD 2 in far northern Calvert County and southern Anne Arundel County. MD 2 was originally constructed as one of the original state roads in the early to mid-1910s. The state highway from Edgewater south to Owings was reconstructed in stages from the early 1950s to the mid-1960s, when the Owings-Friendship portion of MD 2 was relocated. As portions of the old MD 2 were bypassed, they were designated segments of MD 778. Route description View north along MD 778 in Owings MD 778 begins at an intersection with MD 2 (Solomons Island Road) south of Owings. The roadway continues on the other side of MD 2 as county-maintained Grovers Turn Road. MD 778 heads northeast as a two-lane undivided road and immediately intersects unmarked MD 765H, an unnamed old alignment of MD 2. The highway crosses over Hall Creek and meets MD 260 (Chesapeake Beach Road) in the village of Owings. Shortly after the intersection with MD 260, MD 778 crosses the Calvert-Anne Arundel county line. The state highway continues north through farmland to its northern terminus in the village of Friendship. From the northern terminus, MD 261 heads east as Friendship Road, a county-maintained portion of Friendship Road heads west toward MD 2, and Old Solomons Island Road continues north as a county highway toward a separate intersection with MD 2. History Solomons Island Road, including the portion of the highway from south of Owings to south of Edgewater, was chosen as one of the original state roads to be developed by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1909. The highway from south of Owings to Lothian (also known as Mount Zion) was graded and surfaced as a dirt road between 1910 and 1912. That road was later surfaced with gravel and had many of the more dangerous curves modified by 1921. Solomons Island Road from Lothian to Edgewater was built as a wide gravel road in 1915. When state highways were first assigned numbers in 1927, Solomons Island Road became the southern part of MD 2. By 1934, MD 2 had been expanded to a width of south of Edgewater. MD 2 from Owings to Edgewater starting receiving its first major upgrades in the 1950s, including several relocations of the highway. The bypassed portions of MD 2 became segments of MD 778, with the letter suffix on the highway designation corresponding to the order the sections were bypassed. The highway from Edgewater south to Harwood (then known as Butlers) was widened and resurfaced with bituminous stabilized gravel in 1950 and 1951. MD 2 from Harwood south to Lothian was widened and resurfaced with bituminous stabilized gravel in 1952 and 1953. Old Solomons Island Road between Harwood Road and Polling House Road in Harwood remained part of the state highway system until 1987. Improvements to MD 2 from MD 423 north of Friendship to MD 258 north of Tracys Landing began in 1957 and were completed by 1960. That highway was first paved with bituminous stabilized gravel and later a second stage of bituminous concrete. The segment of Old Solomons Island Road immediately to the north of MD 423 remained in the state highway system until 1963. That same year, work on expanding and relocating the highway from Lothian south to MD 258 was completed. The portion of the old highway immediately to the south of Nutwell Road, now named Old Ridge Path Road, remained in the state highway system until 1987. MD 778 through Owings and Friendship was designated in 1965 when MD 2 was relocated to the west of the two villages. By 1999, the portion of MD 778 north of MD 261 was transferred to Anne Arundel County to be maintained.

Early life A native of Bay City, Michigan, Wheeler began to attain athletic prominence playing halfback and quarterback for the football team at Bay City Central High School from 1924 to 1926. College career After graduating from high school, he enrolled at the University of Michigan and played on the freshman football team in 1927.

Wheeler had his best season as a senior in 1930. He demonstrated his versatility by playing all three backfield positions (quarterback, halfback and fullback) for the undefeated 1930 Michigan Wolverines football team that compiled a record of 8‚Äì0‚Äì1. In the 1930 season opener, Wheeler was the Wolverines' starting quarterback and scored two touchdowns in a 33‚Äì0 victory over ].

He also caught a 20-yard touchdown pass from Harry Newman in a 15‚Äì7 win over Illinois. In the seventh week of the 1930 season, Wheeler scored the only touchdown in Michigan's 7‚Äì0 win over Minnesota in the annual competition for the Little Brown Jug. Wheeler scored the touchdown in the first quarter on a 45-yard punt return which a newspaper account of the game described as follows: > \\"Wheeler's run will go down as one of Michigan's, classics. He got the ball > after a low, twisting kick by [Clarence] Munn had traveled to the Minnesota > 45-yard line. Wheeler gathered it in and charged. He hit two Minnesota > tacklers and knifed his way between them. He staggered a yard or two from > the impact and sidestepped another Gopher tackler. Morrison came across like > a charging bull to take another from Wheeler's path. He waved away, and slid > yards across the goal line on his dive for a touchdown.\\" Michigan head coach Harry Kipke praised Wheeler's performance during the 1930 season as follows: > \\"He was our offensive spark, as well as our best ground gainer. He lacked > confidence up to this year, it seems, but he had it when this season opened > and he got better as the season progressed. He worked effectively with > Simrall, Hudson and Newman in carrying out the running attack. He blocked > well for them, and they for him.\\" Despite his slight build at 155 pounds, Wheeler scored 30 of the 111 points scored by Michigan in 1930 and was selected as a first-team All-Big Ten player by Claire Burcky of the Newspaper Editors Association. Burckey explained his selection of Wheeler as follows: \\"The reason Jack Wheeler, the Bay City boy, made my team is because he kept Michigan going when Harry Newman failed. Wheeler's punt handling, run-backs and interception of passes provided the brightest bits of ball lugging Michigan showed to the conference this season.\\" Wheeler was voted by his teammates on the 1930 Michigan team as the recipient of the Most Valuable Player award. He also finished second behind Wes Fesler in the voting for the Chicago Tribune Silver Football trophy awarded to the Most Valuable Player in the Big Ten Conference. Late life In February 1990, Wheeler died at age 81. He was a resident of Midland, Michigan at the time of his death.

He volunteered for service in Fiji and he served as principal of the Methodist Church's Toorak Boys' High School in Suva. In late 1942, the Pacific Campaign of World War II was at its peak and the Colonial Authority was issued a command that all urban schools should close and surrender their compounds for use as military camps for forces fighting the Japanese threat. Other overseas teachers immediately left Fiji to await the end of the war elsewhere. But Donnelly, the determined missionary principal, sent a circular to all members of the senior classes of Classes Six, Seven, and Eight of Toorak Boys School, inviting volunteers to accompany him to continue their education. After consultation with the heads of the Methodist Church, he received permission to use the Principal‚Äôs residence at the Davuilevu Technical School, in Nausori. As a result, he and 50 volunteers from Toorak Boys School, met at the Principal‚Äôs residence on 3 March 1943. Their first classrooms were the two master bedrooms with the long verandah on the east side of the structure serving as the library. There were only two classes and the only teacher in addition to Donnelly was Semesa Sikivou. During the 1943 Methodist Church Annual Conference, Donnelly received permission to expand his classes along the same ridge and as a result, the boys themselves, with his guidance, built three large bures, where the teachers staff quarters presently stand. He remained principal of Lelean Memorial School from 1943 until 1945, when he returned to New Zealand. Donnelly returned to Fiji to establish Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna Memorial School in Suva, where he served for three years. He then served at Levuka Public School, on Ovalau, for one year before returning to Lelean in 1971 after the Ms. Furnival tragedy. Under Donnelly‚Äôs guidance, the Lelean school motto, ‚ÄúSeek wisdom and spiritual understanding‚Äù was formulated. William Donnelly was born in Auckland, New Zealand, 27 December 1900. He died 15 September 1975 at Greenlane Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand after a short illness. He was married to Ella Mildred Fowler, with whom he had two children, Helen Janette and Grant Donnelly.

They are singer/songwriter Aaron Hurley and multi- instrumentalist/composer Scott McLaughlin. Contributions have been made to recordings by percussionist Barry Hurley, Loner Deluxe, visual artist/vocalist Andrea Fitzpatrick, accordion player/keyboardist Anne Marie Deacy (Mirakil Whip/Fuaim Bach), trumpet player Ben Isaacs and clarinetist James Wood. They were originally known as Snowmachine and formed in 2005 under that name in Galway, Ireland. An album in a light was released on Deserted Village the same year. It was described as 'perfect ghost radio music'Mini Review: Phantom Dog Beneath the Moon - In a Light and as an 'introspective folk band sitting in a bed of electronic sighs, drones and ambiences'. After discovering there was American alternative country band called Snow Machine,Snow Machine they reverted to Phantom Dog Beneath the Moon. According to Aaron Hurley, the name came about \\"after watching the Jim Jarmusch film Ghost Dog with a full moon shining outside the window\\". They released a four track e.p. in 2007 called Through a Forest Only on Irish record label Rusted Rail.Rusted Rail David Colohan (Agitated Radio Pilot) plays guitar on A Web Emerging From Fog. This time, the music was less reliant on electronics and veered more towards live instrumentation. It was also the first time drums were featured. In 2010, 'The Trees, The Sea in Lunar Stream' was released by Rusted Rail in May 2010. The album features cello, glockenspiel, harpsichord, trumpet (played by Ben Isaacs), double bass, vibraphone, percussion, electronics, bass guitar, classical and electric guitars. The term folk-gaze was coined in reference to the album by Jeanette Leech in Shindig! Magazine. After a long absence, Phantom Dog released another album in March 2017, entitled \\"The Statue of the Hunter is Lost at Sea\\", again on Rusted Rail. Norman Records in Leeds says \\"The third album by Phantom Dog Beneath The Moon arrives after seven years away, but it seems that time has only allowed the Irish group to sound more like themselves.

The name is also used for the modern ruins. History Some later sources claim that the friary was founded in the late 13th century, but these are spurious, and its actual foundation probably did not occur until the mid-15th century.Cowan and Easson, Medieval Religious Houses, pp. 119-20 The first known prior of the house is attested on 22 November 1464.Cowan and Easson, Medieval Religious Houses, p. 120 The foundation of a full Dominican house was preceded by a small oratory or hospice. As James Beaton, archbishop of St Andrews, claimed that he and his predecessors were founders of the house, it is likely the foundation was episcopal. The foundation of the house was probably prompted by the needs of the University of St Andrews. =Expansion= In the 1510s at least, the friary was expanded, the number of brothers rising from two to five. In 1519 the Hospital of St Nicholas and the Dominican friary at Cupar were taken over by St Andrews friary, with the friary at St Monans partially united.Cowan and Easson, Medieval Religious Houses, pp. 117, 120-21 While the friars at Cupar moved to St Andrews, friars were left at St Monans to live out their years.There were no friars by 1557, and apparently the house never had more than two; Cowan and Easson, Medieval Religious Houses, p. 121 The house was severely damaged by the forces of Norman Leslie [of Rothes] in 1547. Sometime after 14 June 1559 but before 22 June 1559 the friars were \\"expelled from their destroyed place\\" by Protestant reformers.Cowan and Easson, Medieval Religious Houses, p. 120; Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community, pp. 86-7, 116-7 This was part of a general movement, associated with the Scottish Reformation, hostile to friaries and other aspects of the old Catholic order. The property of the house was given to the burgh of St Andrews by Queen Mary on 17 April 1567. The remains of a vaulted apse lie where Bell Street meets South Street, outside Madras College.

They are classified into two sub-divisions based on their places of origin, \\"Desh\\" and \\"Konkan\\". Together, these divisions comprise members of various gotras, being the Deshastha, Kokanastha, Saraswat, Karhade, Daivajna and Devrukhe.The Kokanastha are also known by the alternative name, Chitpavan. The Deshastha Brahmins are considered the original Brahmins of Maharashtra, with communities such as the Chitpavan being thought of as migrants from other areas. Geographical distribution Divisions of Maharashtra. Maharashtrian Brahmins are native to the Indian state of Maharashtra. However, their training as priests, expertise in Hindu laws and scriptures, and administrative skills have historically led them to find employment in all corners of India. For example, in the 1700s, the court of Jaipur had Maharashtrian Brahmins recruited from Benares. This community had in turn migrated to Benares after the fall of Vijayanagar empire in southern India. The greatest movement of the community took place when the Maratha Empire expanded across India. Peshwa, Holkars, Scindia, and Gaekwad dynastic leaders took with them a considerable population of priests, clerks, and army men when they established new seats of power. Most of these migrants were from the literate classes such as various Brahmin sub-castes and CKP. These groups formed the backbone of administration in the new Maratha Empire states in many places such as Baroda, Indore, Gwalior, Bundelkhand, and Tanjore. The community in Tanjure in modern day Tamil Nadu state in southern india dates back to early 1700s. In modern times the Maharashtrian brahmin and CKP communities of Indore dominated the RSS and Bharatiya Janasangh (the forerunner of the BJP). In present-day Maharashtra, the community is now mostly urban based.Vora, Rajendra. ‚ÄúShift of Power from Rural to Urban Sector.‚Äù Economic and Political Weekly, vol. 31, no. 2/3, 1996, pp. 171‚Äì173. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/4403686. Accessed 3 Feb. 2020 Brahmins were landlords in many regions of Maharashtra,however, land reform measures undertaken after Indian independence drove them out of the villages.Economic and Political Weekly Vol. 14, No. 7/8, Annual Number: Class and Caste in India (Feb., 1979), pp. 425-427+429+431-433+435-436 (9 pages) Occupation =Historical= Unlike Brahmins elsewhere in India, who traditionally were mostly priests and scholars, those in Maharashtra have had a wider occupational basis, including as administrators, as warriors, as courtiers, in business and in politics. During the era of the Deccan sultanates, when few people in the region shared the Muslim faith of its rulers, Maharashtrian Brahmins were significant recruits to administrative roles and as tax collectors. They were also administrators during the period of the Maratha Empire, spanning the 17th and 18th centuries, when some Chitpavans also emerged as peshwas and thus the de facto rulers. During the peshwa rule, Pune became the de facto financial capital of the empire with the bankers (sawakar in Marathi) being mainly Maharashtrian brahmins. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, many Marathi brahmins migrated north to Hindu holy city of Benaras on the Ganga river. During this period Benaras had become an important center of learning.Seven Marathi brahmin clans became the intellectual elites of the city with patronage from wealthy benefactors during the early Mughal era or even from an earlier period.The clans included Sesa, Bhat, Dharmadhikari, Bharadvaja, Payagunde, Puntambekar and Chowdhuri. These brahmins were collectively called dakshinatya brahmins. The clans dominated the study of Sanskrit scriptures and Hindu laws in the city for many centuries. Most them also mentioned maintained close connections to their original homes in the centers of learning on the Godavari river such as Paithan, Puntamba, and Trimbakeshwar. Benke, T., 2010.

These brahmins form part of the Kumaoni brahmin community. John Roberts has argued that from the time of the Maratha Empire and into the period when the British East India Company was forming the administrative unit of the Bombay Presidency, they were mostly urban dwellers, along with other non-Brahmin clerical castes, and shunned trading roles. This view appears to be distinct to that of Edmund Leech and S. N. Mukherjee, who note the Chitpavan incomers to the region as being involved also in trade and cultivation. =Modern era= The British rulers of Maharashtra region during early years of colonial rule in the nineteenth century recruited for clerical and lower level administrative work mainly from castes such as brahmin and CKP whose traditional occupations involved scholarship, teaching, and record keeping. Incidentally, these castes had considerable experience in government administration during the Peshwa rule which preceded the British rule. Brahmins and CKP were also the first to take to western education. This was their gate way to rise to positions of dominance in many fields during the nineteenth century colonial era.These included positions in professions such as teaching, law, medicine, and engineering.Patterson, M.L., 1954. Caste and political leadership in Maharashtra. The Economic Weekly, pp.1066-7. Maharashtrian brahmins also dominated lower level jobs in the colonial government. The 19th century social reformer, Jyotirao Phule lamented the brahmin domination in education and government jobs. In the early 20th century, however, different governments in the region such as the Bombay Presidency or the princely state of Kolhapur started reservation policies in government jobs at lower levels that discriminated against the brahmins. Being the first to receive western education, Maharashtrian brahmins such as Justice Ranade, or Gopal Hari Deshmukh were at the forefront of social reform, female education, and participation in political process at the local level. They were also equally opposed by more orthodox members' of their own communities such as Lokmanya Tilak for advocating reforms. In the twentieth century, Maharashtrian brahmins such as Savarkar formulated the Hindutva ideology, and Hedgewar, and his successor Golwalkar founded or led the Hindu nationalist organization, the RSS. In the last one hundred years, many brahmin families such Kirloskar, Garware, OgaleDamodaran, H., 2008. Brahmins, Khatris, and Babus. In India‚Äôs New Capitalists (pp. 48-91). Palgrave Macmillan, London., and Mhaiskar have been successful in creating large manufacturing, and construction businesses. Society and Culture =Religious customs= The deshastha and the karhade historically allowed cross-cousin marriages but the chitpavan did not.Karve, I., 1958. What is caste. Economic Weekly, 10(4), p.153. Although campaign to allow widow remarriage started in the 19th century in the Maharashtrian brahmin communities, it was not until the mid 20th century that it became acceptable. The practice used to cause immense distress widows, especially to the young ones, from these castes as opposed to widows from other marathi hindu castes. =Diet= A Maharashtrian vegetarian meal with a variety of items Maharashtrian Brahmins, Deshasthas, Chitpavans and Karhades have historically been Lacto-vegetarians. During the Peshwa era, brahmins of Pune passed caste specific laws for alcohol consumption.  Social issues  Sociologist Sharmila Rege writes that, as the demand of the British Raj for administrators increased and thus guided the direction of education policy, the \\"caste composition of the emerging intelligentsia\\" demonstrated how the upper castes were able to cement their socio-economic position by dominating recruitment to the available bureaucratic positions. They also dominated selection for the schools themselves, demanding that lower caste students be rejected. For example, from 1827 to 1848, in the Elphinstone institutes of Bombay, 25 of the 152 matriculants came from lower castes, while in 1886 one Pune school registered 911 Brahmins in its roll of 982 students. Gail Omvedt concludes that during the British era, the overall literacy of Brahmins and CKPs was overwhelmingly high as opposed to the literacy of others such as the Kunbis and Marathas. Specifically, the top three literate castes were Deshasthas, Chitpavans and CKPs. Men were more literate than the women from any caste. Female literacy as well as English literacy showed the same pattern among castes. Bal Gangadhar Tilak believed that the Deshastha, Chitpawan and Karhade should get united. He encouraged this by writing comprehensive discussions on the urgent need for these three sub-castes to intermarry and dine together.  Politics  Maharashtrian Brahmins have played a significant role in the Hindu nationalist movement. Christophe Jaffrelot, a political scientist, states that even in Indore (a city in Madhya Pradesh), from 1950 to 1965, Maharashtrian Brahmins and CKP together accounted for two-third or three-fourth of the Hindu nationalist representation in the municipal councils. Jaffrelot thinks that Brahmins are still resented by the Marathas and Dalits of Maharashtra despite no longer having much political power. Anti-Brahmin violence After Gandhi's murder by Nathuram Godse, himself a Brahmin, Brahmins in Maharashtra, in 1948, became targets of violence, mostly by some elements from the Maratha caste. V. M. Sirsikar, a political scientist at the University of Pune, noted that Another political scientist, Donald B. Rosenthal, said that the motivation for the violence was the historical discrimination and humiliation faced by the Maratha community due to their caste status and \\"Even today, local Brahmins claim that the Marathas organized the riots to take political advantage of the situation\\".

Known as Southern Maryland Boulevard, the highway runs from MD 4 in Bristol north to MD 408 at Waysons Corner in southwestern Anne Arundel County. MD 794 is the old alignment of MD 4 between Bristol and Waysons Corner. Southern Maryland Boulevard was constructed in the late 1920s and was designated MD 416. MD 416 was expanded to a divided highway in the early 1960s, shortly before MD 416 became part of MD 4. Northbound MD 4 followed the original alignment of MD 416 until MD 4 was upgraded to a freeway in the early 1990s and MD 794 was extended along its current course. Route description View north along MD 794 at MD 258 in Bristol MD 794 begins as an exit ramp from northbound MD 4 in Bristol. The road becomes a two-way, two-lane undivided road at its intersection with MD 258 (Bay Front Road). After passing an entrance ramp to northbound MD 4 and the southern terminus of MD 259 (Greenock Road), MD 794 heads in a straight line northwest. The road crosses Galloway Creek and receives a pair of exit ramps from MD 4, with a park and ride lot serving MTA Maryland commuter buses located southwest of the road between the ramps, before reaching its northern terminus at MD 408 (Mount Zion-Marlboro Road) at Waysons Corner. History MD 794 was originally constructed as the northernmost part of the Southern Maryland Boulevard, a highway built on a completely new alignment to better connect Calvert County with Upper Marlboro and Washington. The new highway was constructed as an wide concrete road from MD 4 at Waysons Corner south to MD 2 at Sunderland in 1929 and 1930. Southern Maryland Boulevard was marked as MD 416 by 1933. In 1934, the Maryland State Roads Commission proposed MD 416 be widened to . The highway was widened from from Waysons Corner south into Calvert County in 1948. MD 416 was widened to at its intersection with MD 4 in 1950. MD 416 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway in Anne Arundel County in 1961 and 1962, including an interchange with MD 258. For the expansion project, a new roadway was constructed for southbound MD 416 and the existing roadway was turned into the highway's northbound lanes. The exception was at the MD 258 interchange, through which a new northbound roadway was constructed. The ramps between northbound MD 416 and MD 258, which were part of the original MD 416, became the southernmost portion of modern MD 794. MD 416 was renumbered MD 4 and MD 4 east of Waysons Corner became MD 408 in 1965. MD 4 was upgraded to a freeway through Waysons Corner and Bristol in 1991. A new roadway was constructed for northbound MD 4 between southbound MD 4 and the old northbound lanes; the old northbound lanes became a northern extension of MD 794 to its present terminus.

Mason College, now the University of Birmingham. Hermann Georg Fiedler (1862‚Äì1945), was a German scholar, who became Taylor Professor of the German Language and Literature at the University of Oxford (1907‚Äì37). He was previously lecturer in German at Mason College (which later became Birmingham University). Biography H.G. Fiedler was born in 1862 in Zittau, Germany. In July 1888, he received a doctorate from the University of Leipzig in German philology and literature under Friedrich Zarncke. In October 1888, Zarncke helped in Fiedler becoming a lecturer in German at Queen Margaret College and the University of Glasgow until 1890. In October 1890, Fiedler was then appointed Professor of German at Mason College. Fiedler was instrumental in the setting up of University of Birmingham. He was a member of the initial committee of nine set up in 1894 by Robert Heath. In July 1907, Fiedler was appointed the first Taylor Professor of the German Language and Literature at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of The Queen's College. In 1911, he became a British citizen and he was a tutor to the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII) between 1912‚Äì14. However, in 1915, during World War I, he felt obliged to offer his resignation, but this was not accepted. He continued to run the German department at Oxford University during World War I. In 1926, Fiedler was appointed secretary to the curators of the Taylor Institution in central Oxford. He improved the Taylor Institution Library and was in charge of the extension of the Taylor Institution, which was opened in 1932 by the Edward, Prince of Wales. In May 1931, he met the physicist Albert Einstein, a fellow German speaker, during a visit by Einstein to Oxford. He retired in 1937. During the first years of Nazi rule in Germany, Fiedler continued to work for understanding between Germany and the United Kingdom. In August 1935, two months after Hitler had concluded the Anglo-German Naval Agreement with the U.K. and thus given rise to hopes for peace, Fiedler represented the U.K. at the 50th anniversary celebrations of the Goethe-Gesellschaft (Goethe Society) in Weimar. In his short speech on this occasion, he stressed ties between his native and adopted countries, to enthusiastic applause. As late as 1938, he had \\"a warm heart for Germany\\". H.G. Fiedler edited a number of books related to German studies during his career, particularly an anthology of German verse (Das Oxforder Buch Deutscher Dichtung vom 12ten bis zum 20sten Jahrhundert, with a foreword by Gerhart Hauptmann, Oxford 1911, 2nd edn. 1927, reprinted many times). The selection of poets was conservative, with few of the truly innovative poets of the twentieth century, especially those from Expressionism or with Marxist leanings. Fiedler never published a full-length scholarly monograph, but focused on pedagogy and collecting manuscripts of German authors. These formed the core of an important collection at the Taylor Institution of Oxford University. Family In 1899, Hermann Fiedler married his former pupil Ethel Mary (1870/71‚Äì1933, a daughter of Charles Harding), who wrote a diary covering their marriage between 1899‚Äì1922. They had two daughters, Herma (born 1902) and Beryl (born 1913). Beryl died on 2 May 1920, which caused serious depression in Ethel for the rest of her life.

Indo-Aryanisation of Indo-Greeks, Indo- Hepthalites, Indo-Scythians In North-West India, the stray Indo-Greeks, Hephthalites and Saka Scythians, became absorbed into the greater Indo-Aryan population of India when losing their own government being replaced by a successive empire. Many Indo-Aryan ethnic groups claim ancestry of these ancient peoples. Such Indo-Aryan ethnic groups being supposedly of such ancestry are most notably, the Punjabis, Sindhis, Rajasthanis and Gujaratis. Indo-Aryanisation of Indian Arabs, Indian Africans, Indian Jews and Jewish origin groups Three religious groups in Kerala, the Mappila Muslim community, who trace their origins to the Arab traders, the Nasrani Christians who trace their roots back to Syrian missionaries, and the Cochin Jewish communities who trace their origins to Jewish traders at the turn of the millennium in Kerala, underwent a process of Indo-Aryanisation as they were absorbed over time and adopted customs from their surrounding Indian community. The Indian African Siddi community in Karnataka who were brought to India originally by the Muslim rulers in 12th-13th century as military slaves, eventually worked up their way to the higher ranks in the armies of the Indian rulers and slowly assimilated into the local communities. Middle Ages =Muslim migration into the Indian Subcontinent= During the Muslim rule of the Northern and Northwestern Subcontinent, the rulers, who themselves were mostly of Turkic and Afghan origin, began to adopt the Indo-Aryan languages as their native tongue. For this reason many of these Turkic and Afghan rulers assimilated into Indo-Aryan speakers, thus many Indian Muslims today claim descent of these ancient peoples. =Mughals= The Turco-Mongol Mughals initially spoke Chagatai, a Turkic language, then adopted Persian before adopting Urdu as their new native tongue. =Ahoms= Originally one of the Tai tribes, the Ahom people assimilated to Hinduism and other elements of Hindu culture after their migration to Assam and nearby regions. Gradually the Ahom language spoken by the tribe was replaced by Assamese, an Indo-Aryan language. As a result, the Ahom language is extinct as a spoken language and only used for ritualistic purposes.Dipima Buragohain. Issues of Language Contact and Shift in Tai Ahom = Early Pashtun (Afghan) settlers in the Indian Subcontinent= Afghans came from Afghanistan and Afghania into India to claim a land called Rohillakand and then got assimilated ultimately adopting Urdu, forgetting Pashto, when being overruled by Mughals. Mughals and Pashtuns had an ancient history of bitterness. Pathan was an Indo-Aryanised version of the name Pashtun. Many Rohilla Pashtuns began inter-marriage with their neighboring Indian Muslims. To this reason, Pashto-Speakers of Afghanistan and Afghania will not consider them as Pashtuns, believing that they have very little Pashtun blood in them. Many Pathans will claim their pure Pashtun, due to the concept in Asia, that someones Paternal Lineage to determines their ethnicity, and even in the Pakhtunwali, ones father has to be Pashtun, when being determined an ethnic Pashtun. When in India, the Rohilla identity is present among Indian Muslims, but when moving into Pakistan, the identity strikingly decreases, as Rohillas consider the \\"Pakistani\\" identity instead of Rohilla. 30-35% of Muhajirs in Pakistan are likely Rohilla Pashtuns, but is likely to become absorbed into the central Pakistani culture. When claiming Afghan descent, would ultimately mean Pashtun, since the name in the past was an ethnic term and not a nationality, since the change of the name Afghan from ethnicity to nationality didn't happen until 50 years ago. Modern South Asia Indo-Aryanisation occurs in South Asia today =India= Dravidians During the declaration of Hindi as an official language of India, many criticisms were received from some populations of India.

Born in Waldbr√∂l, he was one of six children born to politician and jurist Jakob Salentin von Zuccalmaglio and Clara Deycks. His brother Vinzenz Jakob von Zuccalmaglio was a successful writer and poet. The song \\"Kein sch√∂ner Land in dieser Zeit\\" (No more beautiful country in this time [these times]) was published by him as an \\"Abendlied\\" (evening song or hymn) in 1840. It was one of many in a collection of Volksliedern (folk songs), but in fact Anton Wilhelm von Zuccalmaglio himself is the author of \\"Kein sch√∂ner Land in dieser Zeit\\". One of those words is confusing even to some German native speakers, as \\"sch√∂ner\\" is here a shortened form of \\"kein sch√∂neres Land ...\\", ‚Ä≤not one land/country (being) more beautiful ...‚Ä≤. The song continues to be found in almost every collection of traditional German songs. He died at Haus Nachrodt near Altena.

Organization The Tea Party of Nevada qualified as a minor political party with the Nevada Secretary of State on January 27, 2010. Ashjian's supporters created the party by filing more than the 250 signatures needed. The Tea Party of Nevada's stated goals include striving to \\"promote this nation's founding principles of freedom, liberty and a small representative government.\\" The party stated in its preamble that both major political parties were responsible for a \\"massive national debt\\" in the United States, and that the \\"great conservative majority in America\\" should not believe that the Democrats and Republicans would support their views. Ashjian filed his candidacy on March 2, 2010, and became the candidate of the Tea Party of Nevada for United States Senate in the 2010 Nevada general election. Ashjian's candidacy is the only one which appears as the \\"Tea Party\\" on the November 2010 ballot. In April 2010, Ashjian faced a legal challenge which attempted to remove his name from the ballot. Carson City, Nevada district judge James Todd Russell heard arguments on whether Ashjian could remain on the ballot starting on April 14. Judge Russell ultimately ruled that Ashjian complied with the intent of the law and he could remain on the ballot. The American Independent Party, which brought the suit against Ashjian, filed an appeal of the case to the Nevada Supreme Court. On October 6, 2010, the Nevada Supreme Court issued a unanimous ruling that Ashjian's candidacy would remain on the November 2010 ballot.

Joseph Vincent Devine (March 3, 1892 ‚Äì September 21, 1951) was a baseball scout for the Pittsburgh Pirates and New York Yankees, credited for signing Joe DiMaggio to the Yankees.  Baseball career  Born in Oakland, California, Devine was an outfielder in the minor leagues, and was on the spring training roster of the Boston Red Sox in 1917, but never advanced to the majors. He managed a local team in Seattle during World War I, scouted with Seattle Rainiers, and managed a baseball team in Calgary before joining the Pittsburgh Pirates organization. After the Pirates he managed the Mission Reds of San Francisco. By 1932 he was hired by Paul Krichell to be the New York Yankees chief scout in the West. He also signed Andy Carey, Jerry Coleman, Fenton Mole, Johnny Lindell, Cliff Mapes, Charlie Silvera, and Leo Righetti.  Scouting style  Devine's scouting style was similar to Krichell's; he not only looked for ability, but also checked a player's personality and character to see if they could handle the pressure of playing for the Yankees. He also looked for size, signing only two players under in height. Joe Devine Airway Park Shortly after his death in 1951, the ballpark in Boise, Idaho, was renamed Joe Devine Airway Park.

Burlew grew the company significantly as the lamp plant continued to grow, Burlew expanded into the manufacturing of vacuum tubes for radios in 1922. Within seven years of purchasing the company it had expanded with plants in Bowling Green, Kentucky and Tell City and Huntingburg, Indiana.

Ken-Rad was secured several government and defense contracts during World War II. The company grew to be very important to the war effort, and when it was threatened by a strike in 1944 it was seized by the Department of War under order of President Roosevelt.

A short road in District Heights, Maryland, off Scott Key Drive is the only road that still uses the Oxon Run Parkway name. In 1946, the NCPPC voted to change the name of several parkways including Oxon Run Parkway to just \\"parks\\" because they did not contain a road through the middle; but the name \\"Oxon Run Parkway\\" remained in popular use and outlived the change. History The Oxon Run Parkway was created by the National Capital Park and Planning Commission (NCPPC) to provide park space to the people of Washington, to allow for the construction of a sewer main and to prevent construction in the floodplain. In 1924, Congress created the NCPPC to create a park and playground system for the National Capital and by 1926, they had begun making plans for a \\"parkway\\" or park system that would include land along the Anacostia, at Fort Dupont, along Foundry Branch and along Oxon Run. By 1930, NCPPC had begun purchasing narrow strips of land along the shores of the stream for the park. This coincided with a report from NCPPC identifying Oxon Run as a possible water source for Maryland. The report stated that a sewer would be needed through the valley to protect the waters of Oxon Run from pollution. After a 1937 flood, NCPPC decided to purchase 144 additional acres of land in the valley from the District line to the Camp Simms rifle range north of 14th. The land would widen the Parkway above the high water mark, thus preventing the construction of homes that might be prone to flooding. It also allowed for the construction of the sewer project, the Oxon Run interceptor, that was completed in 1939. Expansion continued as were purchased in 1939 and another 64 in 1940, bringing the total to 137. Small additional purchases, of more than , were made later in 1940 and in 1941, and then in 1942 a further were acquired. Another were purchased in 1944 as the 8-year long Oxon Run Parkway and flood control project wrapped up its work. At this point the Parkway extended across the entire District, with the exception of the portion within Camp Simms. In 1946, President Truman signed an amendment to the Capper-Crampton Act which, among other things, called for the Parkway to be extended into Maryland from the District Line to Marlboro Pike (then known as Marlboro Road). This extension, however, was carried out by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission and was never part of the Parkway, nor did it ever extend past the Suitland Parkway. In 1951, NCPPC began work on transferring some of the Camp Simms Firing Range, an irregular shaped plot located between Alabama Avenue, Southern Avenue, 13th and Valley Terrace to the National Park Service. The portion they sought for the park was between Mississippi Ave and Valley Avenue, as the Parkway already included the land on both sides of the rifle range. The range had been in use since 1904, but by 1953 it no longer was and the District was making plans to extend a highway through the area, with one lane on each side of the run. In 1958, the Defense Department transferred the land to the General Services Administration and later of the site was added to the parkway. In July 1994, while digging wells in preparation for the Green Line tunnel, Metro discovered 6 Stokes mortar rounds, prompting the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) to begin a clean-up of the site. By the end of 1995 they had found 30 pieces of live ammunition, and by the end of 1997 a total of 74 pieces. The clean-up took two years and delayed construction of the Green Line tunnel beneath the Parkway. Following the clean-up, the National Park Service and the USDA National Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) performed an ecological restoration of Oxon Run within the Parkway, stabilizing the soil with jute mating and planting new plants. They also restored the old rifle range, which contained lead-contaminated soils and old shell casings left from years of target practice, by covering it with new top soil. Work was completed in January 2000. NCPPC began divesting itself of the land it had acquired as early as 1942 when it turned over the Oxon Run Recreation Center, between Mississippi and Valley Avenue & 4th and 6th Streets, to the then newly formed District Recreation Board. In 1971, NCPC transferred of federal parkland from the National Park Service to the District government, part of a larger transfer, including Watts Branch, Pope Branch and most of the Oxon Run Parkway. The transferred land along Oxon Run became Oxon Run Park. Other plots were handed over for schools and for an arts recreation center.

The leader of the party which assassinated Cardinal Beaton, he was forced to flee Scotland, serving the monarchs of England and France. He died serving the latter in 1554. Family and early life Norman was the eldest son of George Leslie, 4th Earl of Rothes, by Margaret, only daughter of William Crichton, 3rd Lord Crichton, denominated, 1 April 1517, his 'sponsa affidata.'. No marriage ceremony is recorded to have taken place, and the marriage was in 1520 declared null and void. Norman seems to have been regarded as illegitimate. The notices in the 'Lord Treasurer's Accounts' in 1537 and 1539 of dresses furnished to him indicate that he at this time held some office at court. On 7 December 1541 the office of sheriff of Fife, then made hereditary in the Rothes family, was bestowed on him for life, his father personally resigning it. He is described by Buchanan as a young man of such accomplishments that he had not his equal in all Scotland. He fought at Solway Moss in 1542 and was taken prisoner, but received his liberty as the result of the bond signed by the captive Scottish nobles to promote the interests of Henry VIII in Scotland. To this is perhaps partly traceable his zeal against Cardinal Beaton, but it was at least quickened by an act passed, 12 December 1543, at the instance of the cardinal, restoring to Sir James Colville the lands of Castle Wemyss, which on the forfeiture of Colville had been bestowed by James V on the Rothes family. Murder of Cardinal Beaton On 17 April 1544 Henry VIII received information that the Master of Rothes and others were willing to undertake the slaughter of the cardinal as he passed through Fife, on condition that they had the assurance of Henry's protection afterwards. Obtaining no satisfactory answer, they did not take advantage of the supposed opportunity, and subsequently, with his father, Norman appears to have given a pledge of personal service to the cardinal. He actively supported Charteris, the nominee of Beaton, against Lord Ruthven, in their contest for the provostship of Perth. He also fought against the English at the battle of Ancrum Moor, 12 February 1545, when his opportune arrival with three hundred spearmen from Fife, and with the news that the Scotts of Buccleuch were following on his heels, decided the Scots to risk the battle. Negotiations for the murder of the cardinal were, with or without the sanction of Leslie, resumed with Henry on 30 May 1545, and were continued till at least 20 October following. How much longer a blank in Henry's Scottish correspondence renders it impossible to state. The execution of Wishart at the instance of the cardinal, 1 March 1546, was apparently rather an opportune pretext for the cardinal's assassination than the direct cause of it. The statement of contemporary writers that Norman Leslie had not long before the murder a violent personal quarrel with Beaton seems probable. Norman Leslie was the leader of the conspirators. The castle of St. Andrews, where Beaton lived, was seized by men under his command, but he took no personal part in the act of assassination on 29 May 1546, and John Leslie of Parkhill, his uncle, struck the fatal blow, after the cardinal had requested that Norman, whom he called his friend, should come to him. A dagger erroneously reputed to have been used by Norman is preserved in Leslie House, Fife. After the murder After the murder Norman and his associates took refuge in the cardinal's stronghold. They were besieged in St Andrew's Castle by the governor of Scotland, Regent Arran. On 11 March 1547 Norman and his colleagues, Henry Balnaves, James Kirkcaldy of Grange, and Alexander Whitelaw of Newgrange witnessed a pledge made by Patrick Gray, 4th Lord Gray to Edward VI. The lairds in the castle, sometimes called the Castilians, were summoned to answer for the murder, and, failing to do so, were on 30 July 1547 denounced as rebels. On the same day the castle was surrendered to the French, and a condition having been made that the lives of all within it should be spared, its principal defenders were carried captives to France. Norman probably made his escape from France at the same time as Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange, but there is no direct information on the point. After his release, he, according to John Spottiswood, returned to Scotland, but on search being made for him he escaped by sea to Denmark. Thence he crossed over to England, where for some time he was in the enjoyment of a pension from Edward VI. The accession of Queen Mary in 1553 compelled him to leave England, and he went to France, where he entered into the service of Henry II. He was mortally wounded in an action before the stronghold of Renti, near Cambrai, on 14 August 1554. At the head of thirty Scots he heroically charged sixty horsemen armed with culverins, unhorsing five of them with his spear before it broke. He made his way back to the constable of France, his horse dropping down dead at the constable's feet. He was brought into the king's tent, and died of his wounds on 29 August, fifteen days afterwards. His bravery and the manner of his death so impressed the French king that he used his influence with the queen-regent and the estates to obtain for the other confederates against Beaton the reversion of their lands. Leslie was married to Isobel Lindsay, daughter of John Lindsay, 5th Lord Lindsay, but left had no children with her. He did however have two natural sons, named Robert and John.

The coat of arms is rarely seen by itself; it is almost always used in the city seal or on the city flag. The current coat of arms was adopted in 1789, although prior to that it was significantly simpler, ranging from stylized lettering to a caricature of a beaver. Included in the coat of arms are references to Albany's agricultural and fur-trading past. It is supported by a white man and an American Indian and is crested by a sloop. The coat of arms is meant to represent the \\"symbols of industry and its rewards to man and beast on land and sea\\". History alt=A black and white image shows a wax seal consisting of an octagon with a crown and the letters ALB inside it. alt=A black and white image shows a wax seal consisting of a circle, inside which is a beaver at center, topped by the letters ALBANY, atop the year 1752. Albany began as the Dutch fur-trading post Fort Orange in 1624. Around the fort grew the village of Beverwijck (), which was incorporated in 1652. In 1664, the English sacked New Netherland and Beverwyck was renamed Albany in honor of the Duke of York and Duke of Albany (later James II of England). When the city was incorporated by provincial governor Thomas Dongan in 1686 under the Dongan Charter, it was empowered to have its own seal: > The said Mayor, Aldermen and Commonalty of the City of Albany, and their > successor shall and may forever hereafter, have one common seal to serve for > the sealing of all and singular their affairs and business touching or > concerning the said corporation. And it shall and may be lawful to and for > the said Mayor, Aldermen and Commonalty of the said city of Albany, and > their successors, as they shall see cause, to break, change, alter and new > make their said common seal, and as often as to them shall seem convenient. The first known use of the seal was on a deed from the city of Albany sold at auction. Signed by Albany's first mayor, Pieter Schuyler, the document was sealed with red wax, the design on which was an octagon with a monogram of the letters ALB in the center topped with a crown (see Figure 1). This document was found in 1886. This seal was again seen on a document from 1736, though that too was not found until 1886. The letters are presumed to be an abbreviation of the name of the city. However the meaning of the crown is unknown; it was noted for being \\"hardly a kingly crown, nor in shape like a coronet, the head attire of nobility\\".Banks, Danaher, and Hamilton (1888), p. 416 Prior to 1752 (but after 1736), the seal had a beaver at center, with the letters \\"ALB\\" above it. This seal was replaced in 1752 with the abbreviation removed and replaced with \\"Albany\\" above the beaver and the year below as such: > Resolved and ordered by this Board‚ÄîThat the old seal of this corporation, > now in the hands of the Mayor, be changed and altered, and that there be a > new seal in its place, which new seal, being now produced to this board and > approved of by them, the same is ordered to be lodged in the hands of our > present clerk in his office for the use and behoof of this corporation, and > that the present now new seal be henceforth our seal and called, deemed and > esteemed the common seal of this corporation until it be altered and changed > and the aforesaid former seal be null and void and dead in law to all > intents and purposes whatsoever.Banks, Danaher, and Hamilton (1888), p. 418 The seal from 1752 is shown in Figure 2. The beaver honored Albany's past as an important fur trading port. Adding to the history of this seal, one historian states, \\"[The seal] displays the beaver, but looking in the original, more like a drowned cat than the fat and sleek animal, it was intended to represent. Neither the resolution nor the records state why the change was made.\\"Banks, Danaher, and Hamilton (1888), p. 419 In 1755 the original seal (Figure 1) was reinstated for use by the mayor in licensing businesses. So at this point the city had two seals, one corporate and one public. The earlier seal, however, was last seen in 1761 and the beaver continued as the sole city seal from then on.Banks, Danaher, and Hamilton (1888), p. 420 The current seal was adopted in 1789 and first shows up in 1790, when Simeon De Witt, Albany's city surveyor, included the arms on his map of the city. An updated map from 1794 also includes the arms. Both versions include a full landscape in the upper portion of the shield including multiple beavers and trees, as opposed to just one beaver and tree in the current version. There is no documented reasoning for changing the seal from the beaver to the coat of arms, and the coat of arms itself \\"seems to [have] no record authority\\" making it in any way official. Description The current coat of arms consists of numerous traditional heraldic attributes. The shield is party per fess argent and gules; that is, split horizontally in two with a red lower half and silver upper half. Its lower half contains two golden sheaves of wheat on a red background; this design represents Albany's agricultural past. The upper half, which has a silver background, depicts a beaver gnawing at the stump of a fallen tree. This scene represents Beverwyck's former fur trade, which was vital to the development of Albany. One supporter can be seen on each side of the shield. The man on the left is a European-descended farmer dressed in simple clothes; he is supporting the shield with his left hand. His right hand rests on his hip and a sickle hangs from his waist; this references Albany's former agricultural society. The man on the right is an American Indian dressed in a loin cloth and wearing moccasins and a quiver. He supports the shield with his right hand and holds a bow over his left shoulder. The two men supporting the shield together represent the cooperation between white immigrants and Indians in the early development of the city, which would not have existed without the Indian fur trade. The men stand on a scroll displaying the motto Assiduity, meaning \\"the quality of acting with constant and careful attention\\". The torse is argent and gules, following the pattern of the shield. The crest is a sloop under full sail facing left, \\"denoting Albany's supremacy at the head of the sloop navigation of the Hudson River\\".Banks, Danaher, and Hamilton (1888), p. 421 The coat of arms represents the \\"symbols of industry and its rewards to man and beast on land and sea\\". At the time of Albany's bicentennial (1886), it was believed that only New York City and Albany possessed arms charged on a shield upheld by supporters.Banks, Danahar, and Hamilton (1888), p. 422 Uses alt=A bronze statue is seen that depicts most of the details of the coat of arms shown in the infobox image. The men and the sloop are three- dimensional representations of the respective components in the shield. The shield itself is relief work. Albany's coat of arms is best known for its use on the city seal and flag. The seal incorporates the coat of arms in an outlined, white circle, with the letters, \\"The Seal of the City of Albany\\" above it. The flag is a horizontal tricolor of orange, white, and blue, and was adopted in 1909 as part of the tricentennial celebration of Henry Hudson's discovery of the Hudson River. It was based on the Prince's Flag as flown by the Dutch East India Company (VOC), for which Hudson sailed in 1609. Its flag was also a tricolor and included the company's logo where the Albany coat of arms is located today. Like Albany's flag, the Prince's Flag was an orange, white, and blue tricolor. The orange was derived from the coat of arms of the Prince of Orange, William the Silent. After 1660, the orange stripe had been replaced by a red one, as the Dutch flag still remains, though no particular reason is cited. Albany chose to use the historic flag as its base. The flag was surrounded by controversy in 1916, when Albany's Common Council voted to change the colors to red, white, and blue as a show of patriotism during World War I. The change was vetoed by Mayor Joseph Stevens. A life-size sculpture of the coat of arms was created by artist and former Times Union political cartoonist Hy Rosen in 1986. Rosen took some liberty with the design, such as adding farm tools to emphasize the city's agricultural and trading history, as well as adding previously undocumented detail; the left supporter also takes on more of the look of an explorer (e.g., Henry Hudson) than a farmer. The statue was commissioned by Norstar Bank President Peter D. Kiernan as part of the park across Broadway from the then-newly renovated Union Station, which Norstar used as its headquarters until buyer Bank of America moved its employees out of the building in 2010. The statue still stands in Tricentennial Park on Broadway.

In the autumn of 1838 Schumann had left Leipzig for Vienna. His relationship with Clara Wieck had reached a point of no return, as her father vehemently opposed anything that might interfere with his daughter's career as a pianist and strongly disapproved of Schumann as a possible son-in-law. Geographically yet not emotionally detached from Clara, he was able to communicate with her only through letters and in his own music. This has been proposed as an explanation for this work, which alternates passages of wistful longing with more robust, declamatory episodes. Background In Vienna, Schumann found himself beset by depression and professional disappointment. Nevertheless, he managed to create a few compositions of remarkable grace and beguiling charm, writing (as he put it) in a \\"lighter more feminine style\\". In his letter of 15 August 1839 to Ernst Becker, Schumann characterized both the Arabeske and Blumenst√ºck as \\"delicate -- for ladies\\". He was influenced by Christian Schuburt's book on musical aesthetics, in which C major, the key of the Arabeske, was identified with the childish and simple, relegating more intense emotions to the sharped keys. Schumann wrote in the year of the creation of the Arabeske, \\"Never refer me again as Jean Paul II or Beethoven II [‚Ä¶] I am willing to be ten times less than these others, and only something to myself.\\" Description The term Arabeske is used here as a poetic metaphor, not only to describe florid decoration, but also, in Schlegel's terms, to suggest a fluid, organic system of fragments that transcends artificial Classical forms. Schumann employs modified rondo form to encompass a short ABACA rondo form, with the gently lyrical main section A, two more intense episodes B (Florestan) and C, and a beautifully pensive Epilog (Eusebius). The piece moves lithely between contrasting moods, and seems to conclude with a gentle recapitulation of the opening material. The poignant postlude that follows comes as an exquisite surprise. Schumann's original metronome markings for this work appear to have been too fast. Clara Schumann later revised them as Light and delicate [Leicht und zart] (crotchet =126), Minor #1 [Minore I] (crotchet =112), and Minor #2 [Minore II] (crotchet =120).

Between 857 and 859 he received a privilege from the Emperor Louis II confirming a cella (probably a small monastic house) called Santa Maria del Mignone. Since this is the first time Santa Maria is mentioned in Farfa's possession it may have been acquired around this time by Perto.Costambeys (2007), 331. Louis's diploma confirmed privileges granted Farfa by his father, Lothair I, in 840. The imperial diploma forbade any financial imposition (\\"tribute or census\\") on Farfa by any pope or secular ruler (\\"duke or prince\\").Costambeys (2007), 342: ut nullus pontifex, dux, princeps aut quislibet superioris vel inferioris ordinis rei publicae procurator idem monasterium sub tributo aut censu constitueret ... sed omni quietudine sua defensione atque imperiali tuitione fultum consisteret. This diploma may have been aimed at courting good relations with the pope (either Benedict III or Nicholas II) or it may be associated with Louis's intervention in the Duchy of Spoleto in 860.Costambeys (2007), 344‚Äì45. Louis needed good friends in central Italy if he was to assert his imperial claims against hsi cousins and in southern Italy, and his claims as king of Italy against the local aristocracy. In 864 Louis confirmed Farfa's possessions and, at the insistence of Bishop Peter of Spoleto, protector of the abbey since 840, made a donation to it in the region of Massa Torana. Around this time Centumcellae, a village on the other side of the valley of Mignone from Santa Maria, was sacked by Saracen marauders. In 854 it was refounded by Pope Leo IV and renamed Leopolis (modern Civitavecchia). Before the ninth century was out Farfa itself would be attacked by Saracens. To them is probably due the obscurity of Farfa's abbots during the period from Perto, who succeeded Hilderic, to Peter, who rescued his monks and his library from the Saracens. Perto was succeeded by John I.
