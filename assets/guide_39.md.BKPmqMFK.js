Page 310. was the name given to the New Zealand forces that were allocated to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) which occupied Japan following the end of the Second World War. The force was deployed between 1946 and 1948, after which it was disbanded and its personnel repatriated to New Zealand. Background Upon the surrender of Japan which ended the combat phase of the Second World War, Allied Forces, including New Zealanders,Henderson 1958. Page 451. Australians, Canadians, and Indians, entered Japan as an occupying force in February 1946 to restore the peace, clean up debris from the atomic blast, help rebuild and direct Japan into becoming a democratic society. Within a week of the surrender Britain invited New Zealand to participate in the occupation of Japan. Due to its weakened condition at the end of the war Britain lacked the resources to provide a force by itself and it wanted members of Commonwealth to help supply sufficient numbers to show the United States that it was still a major power. On 21 August 1945 the New Zealand government agreed to contribute both a land and an air contingent. Land forces =Initial draft= The army contribution which consisted of both male and female members was made through a number of drafts. The initial contingent of the NZEF (Japan) was formed in Florence, Italy, on 19 November 1945. This was intended to provide the initial occupation force until a special occupation force could be created in New Zealand. Prime Minister Peter Fraser wanted the 5,000-strong contribution to be drawn from single male volunteers from the 2NZEF. However, its commander, Lieutenant-General Sir Bernard Freyberg, did not believe this would provide sufficient numbers. As a result, all single non-Maori men from the 13th, 14th and 15th Reinforcements were conscripted for the force. Volunteer officers, and specialists from earlier reinforcements as well as any Maoris who wished to volunteer were allowed to make up the required numbers.Parr. Page 12. As a result, a large number of this draft were very unhappy that after having survived the war they were going to Japan instead of home. The force of just over 4,000 men was built around the 9th Infantry Brigade Group, and was placed under the command of Brigadier K. L. Stewart, who was later replaced by Brigadier W. G. Gentry.Gillespie 1952. Page 311. The initial draft consisted of two infantry battalions‚Äîthe 27th and 22nd Battalions‚Äîas well as the 2nd Divisional Cavalry Regiment, the 25th Field Battery, and the 5th Engineer Company along with supporting elements which included signals, transport, workshops and medical units. Among the first draft were 36 Women's Army Auxiliary Corps personnel (WAACs) and 30 women from the New Zealand Army Nursing Service (NZANS). All were volunteers. The Royal New Zealand Air Force had no problems filling the initial 24 flying positions and 250 support staff positions from over 1,500 applications.Parr. Page 13. On 8 March 1946 the squadron complete with its aircraft departed New Zealand on the British aircraft carrier HMS Glory.McClure. Page 130. Both the land and air force contributions arrived off the port of Kure on the Inland Sea of Japan in March 1946 in the company of HMNZS Achilles and HMNZS Hawera, which joined the Force from their stations in the Pacific where they had been serving during the Japanese surrender. =Relief drafts= In New Zealand service in Japan was more popular with applications from returned servicemen who were having trouble readjusting to civilian life as well as from young men and women who had missed out on wartime service and wanted adventure. Between May 1946 and August 1947 four relief drafts were dispatched from New Zealand to Japan.Parr. Page 12. The relief drafts also featured women in the form of nurses, shorthand typists, hostesses and welfare staff. Deployment By the time the first New Zealand forces arrived in March 1946 United States military forces had already occupied most of Japan. The British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) was to be responsible for Hiroshima Prefecture as it contained a large port, Kure, and an adjacent airfield, Iwakuni. However, the zone of deployment was not big enough and so the area was extended to neighbouring prefectures. Within the BCOF J Force was responsible for the largely rural Yamaguchi Prefecture and Mishima Island, both in the south of Honshu.Parr. Page 14. The initial draft encountered uncomfortable living conditions and poor food, which they compared unfavourably with what they had experienced in Italy.Parr. Page 14. By the time the second relief draft arrived the quality of the accommodation and the supply of food had improved considerably. Because members of the BCOF were paid in pounds sterling whose exchange rate with the yen was set at an artificially low rate in an effort to slow inflation, this allowed members of the force to make money on the black market supplying Japanese with basic goods such as food and soap.Parr. Page 20. Boredom was also initially a major problem, but as non-fraternisation rules were progressively relaxed high rates of venereal disease developed. =Occupation duties= J Force's first task was searching for and collecting military equipment. Little was found as Yamaguchi had not had a major military presence during the war. J Force also oversaw the repatriation of Japanese soldiers coming home from the war and Koreans being returned to their country. Post-war Japan was economically devastated which made it an ideal environment for black marketeering. As such, J Force's policing duties included monitoring black market groups and also large gatherings of people on public occasions and generally keeping order until civilian government could be re-established. J Force also assisted the Americans in promoting democracy in Japan by supervising local and national elections in the prefecture. For a period of a month J Force also provided a guard battalion to Tokyo. This was based at Ebisu Barracks and took part in ceremonial guard duty at the Imperial Palace and the British Embassy. Air force activities =Fighter operations= The Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) reformed No. 14 Squadron RNZAF to provide its contribution. To outfit the squadron, the US provided Corsair FG-1D fighter aircraft,Parr. Page 105. and extended its Lend-lease arrangement to cover the cost. The squadron was commanded by Squadron Leader Jesse de Willimoff, who was later succeeded by Squadron Leader D.F St George.Bentley. Page 143. Initially located in southern Honshu at the former Japanese naval air base at Iwakuni, the squadron undertook armed air patrols designed to protect armament and bomb dumps, identify locations of hidden ammunition, and check schoolyards for forbidden military parades. They also undertook surveillance flights over the seas between Japan and Korea to identify and turn back boats from smuggling Koreans into Japan. The squadron stayed in Japan for second year despite lacking a third of its ground staff due to the New Zealand Treasury Department refusing to fund recruiting advertisements. In February 1948, No.14 Squadron moved to H≈çfu Air Field, where they replaced Royal Australian Air Force Mustangs.McClure. Page 133. After the decision was made to withdraw J Force, twenty Corsairs were stacked together at one end of the airfield in October 1949 and set alight as the air force considered the aircraft to be at the end of their useful life and could not justify the expense of returning them to New Zealand. The only casualty during the deployment was Flight Lieutenant C. W. N Wright who was killed when his aircraft crashed on takeoff.Bentley. Page 143. Personnel departed Japan on 25 November 1948 on MV Westralia.Gillespie. Page 310.Bentley. Page 143. =Support services= Flying Dakota transport aircraft, the RNZAF's No. 41 (Transport) Squadron provided the link between New Zealand and Japan for J Force. Operating over one of the longest air transport routes in the world, the squadron operated between February 1946 and April 1948.McClure. Page 132. Once a week a Dakota departed on the 20,000 km return flight between Whenuapai and Iwakuni carrying supplies and personnel between the two destinations. Return to New Zealand and post-occupation When Great Britain and India withdrew from the BCOF in 1947 enthusiasm for New Zealand‚Äôs ongoing involvement waned. In April 1948 the New Zealand government made the decision to withdraw from Japan. The last New Zealand J Force troops returned home in September 1948.Henderson 1958. Page 460. In total approximately 12,000 New Zealanders served in Japan during the occupation, while 15 members were killed in accidents or died of illness.McGibbon 2000. Page 258. They are buried in the Commonwealth cemetery at Yokohama. Some New Zealand personnel would later return to Japan on R&R; during the Korean War (1950‚Äì1953).McGibbon 1996. Page 225. Once back in New Zealand J Force personnel found they were treated differently from World War II veterans. Their service went unrecognised and until 1964 they were not eligible to join the RSA or receive war pensions. It was not until 1995 that the New Zealand Service Medal 1946‚Äì1949 was instituted to recognise the service of J Force veterans in Japan.McGibbon 2000. Page 258.

It was a single-engined high-wing monoplane designed by Alexander Sergeyevich Yakovlev, with 128 being built. Design and development In 1932, the Soviet aircraft designer Alexander Sergeyevich Yakovlev, working as an engineering supervisor at the Polikarpov OKB, designed the AIR-5, a five-seat high-wing monoplane with a steel-tube fuselage and a wooden wing, powered by an American Wright J-4 Whirlwind radial engine giving 149 kW (200 hp). Although the AIR-5 successfully passed State acceptance trials, no production followed, as there was no suitable Soviet replacement for the imported engine.Gunston 1995, pp. 451, 453‚Äì454.Gordon, Komissarov and Komissarov 2005, pp. 23‚Äì23. Yakovlev instead designed a scaled-down aircraft of similar layout to the AIR-5, but powered by a readily available 75 kW (100 hp) Shvetsov M-11 engine, to serve as a light utility aircraft. The new design, the AIR-6, was a high-wing monoplane using much of the structural design of the AIR-5, (and also featuring landing struts from the Polikarpov U-2 and tail surfaces from the Tupolev I-5 fighter), with a pilot and one or two passengers sitting in tandem in an enclosed cockpit.Gunston 1995, p. 454.Gordon, Komissarov and Komissarov 2005, p. 24. Operational history The prototype AIR-6 flew in 1932, passing state acceptance trials in October 1933.Gordon, Komissarov and Komissarov 2005, pp. 24‚Äì25. An accident with the Yakovlev AIR-7 sport aircraft, however, was blamed on a design error by Yakovlev, who was sacked from the Polikarpov design bureau.Gunston 1995, p. 455. This caused production plans to be delayed until Yakovlev was allowed to set up his own design bureau, with production starting in 1934. A total of 128 AIR-6s were built, with several being fitted with floats, and 20 equipped as specialist ambulance aircraft.Gordon, Komissarov and Komissarov 2005, pp. 25‚Äì26.

It is located on a spot referred to in the 1950s by Churchill as \\"where my statue will go\\". It was unveiled in 1973 by his widow Clementine, Baroness Spencer-Churchill, at a ceremony attended by the serving Prime Minister and four former Prime Ministers, while Queen Elizabeth II gave a speech. The statue is one of twelve statues on or around Parliament Square, most of well-known statesmen. Description The statue is high and is made of bronze. It was sculpted by Ivor Roberts-Jones and is located on the main green of Parliament Square, opposite the Palace of Westminster. It is said that the artist's friend Kyffin Williams stood in as a model for Churchill. The statue shows Winston Churchill standing with his hand resting on his walking stick and wearing a military greatcoat. His pose is based on a well- known photograph of Churchill inspecting the Chamber of the House of Commons after it had been destroyed by bombing on the night of 10‚Äì11 May 1941. The plinth is high with \\"Churchill\\" inscribed on it in large capital letters. A proposal to insert pins standing out of the statue's head was turned down in the 1970s ‚Äì the pins were intended to stop wild birds from sitting on its head. The Churchill Statue Committee had concerns during the statue's development process that it looked \\"a little too much\\" like the Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini. Whilst the head was still only cast in plaster, a report on it stated that, \\"At the moment the head is undoubtedly like Churchill, but perhaps not quite right of him at the pinnacle of his career. The cheeks, the eyes, the forehead and the top of the head require improvement. I told Mr. Roberts-Jones that above the eyes I thought I was looking at Mussolini.\\" Roberts-Jones agreed to modify the sculpture to reduce the dome of the head in order to lower the forehead. History The statue overlooks the Houses of Parliament In the 1950s, David Eccles, then Minister of Works, showed Churchill plans for the redevelopment of Parliament Square. Churchill drew a circle in the north-east corner and declared: \\"That is where my statue will go.\\" The statue that was eventually installed was first suggested by John Tilney, Member of Parliament for Liverpool Wavertree, in a parliamentary question in 1968. Initial estimates by the sponsors of the Winston Churchill Statue Appeal put the cost of the statue at ¬£30,000. The sponsors of the appeal included Edward Heath, Lord Mountbatten, Lord Portal, and Baroness Elliot. The sum of ¬£32,000 was raised by 4,500 individuals who are listed in a book which was deposited in the library at Chartwell on Churchill's birthday, 30 November 1973. The statue was cast by the Meridian Foundry of Peckham Rye, London. The statue was unveiled on 1 November 1973 by Clementine, Baroness Spencer-Churchill, Winston Churchill's widow. Queen Elizabeth II had declined to unveil the statue herself, indicating that she thought it right that Lady Spencer-Churchill should do so, although the Queen did attend the ceremony, and gave a speech in which she mentioned that Churchill had turned down a dukedom because he wanted to spend his remaining years in the House of Commons. Union Flags covered the statue, which were removed as a cord was pulled. Others present at the unveiling included The Queen Mother, members of the Churchill family across four generations, Edward Heath (then Prime Minister) and four former Prime Ministers. The Band of the Royal Marines played several of Churchill's favourite pieces of music. In 2008, the statue was grade II listed. The statue has been defaced on a number of occasions during protests held in Parliament Square. In 2000, at the May Day protest the statue was sprayed with red paint to give the appearance of blood dripping from its mouth and a strip of turf was placed on top of the head, giving the appearance of a mohican or punk rocker hairstyle. In June 2020, during the George Floyd protests, protesters sprayed graffiti on it over two successive days, including, following the inscription \\"Churchill\\", the words \\"was a racist\\". As a result the statue was temporarily covered up to preserve it from further vandalism. A number of statues around the country, including that of Churchill, became part of a debate about whether they should remain on public display or not, and, if so, under what conditions. https://news.sky.com/story/eight-out-of-10-councils-considering-action-on- statues-after-black-lives-matter-protests-12004923 Replicas and related statues A replica of the Parliament Square statue was unveiled in 1999 in Winston Churchill Square in Prague, Czech Republic, outside the University of Economics in the ≈Ωi≈ækov area. It was moulded from the original on site, then cast in bronze. A fibreglass replica stands on the Australian National University campus in Canberra, Australia: it was brought to Australia in 1975, placed in the courtyard garden of Churchill House in 1985, and moved to its present location in Acton sometime after 1992. There are also variant statues of Churchill by Ivor Roberts-Jones on Solli plass in the \\"English Quarter\\" of Oslo, Norway; and in British Place, New Orleans, USA. Like the Parliament Square statue, the Prague, Oslo and New Orleans statues were all cast in London by the Meridian Foundry.

It was established August 20, 2010, when it acquired the deposits and some of the assets of ShoreBank from the FDIC, and was headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. After chronic losses, it was acquired by on Jan 30, 2019 by Providence Bank & Trust. The bank's stated mission was to build vibrant urban neighborhoods and promote economic and environmental sustainability in distressed and underserved areas of Chicago, Cleveland, and Detroit. Its customers ranged from individuals to small businesses, nonprofits, foundations, and faith-based organizations. The bank placed a special emphasis on serving underbanked populations.https://www.upbnk.com/about/mission Origin Urban Partnership Bank was founded in 2011 by the former management of the failed, but politically connected, ShoreBank after the FDIC took the unusual step of permitting the current management team to remain in place and maintain ownership of ShoreBank by allowing them to purchase ShoreBank through the newly chartered Urban Partnership Bank. Although ShoreBank‚Äôs President William Farrow was brought on after regulators ordered ShoreBank to raise additional capital, it is highly unusual for the FDIC to resell to the managers who ran the failed bank. The Urban Partnership Bank became a viable institution thanks to capital injections from large US banks totaling $140 million, write downs taken on nonperforming assets by the FDIC which cost taxpayers $367.7 million and a loss-share agreement to cover future additional losses on assets. http://problembanklist.com/politically-connected-shorebank-of-chicago-fails- and-reincarnated-at-taxpayer-expense-0172/ Urban Partnership Bank acquired all of ShoreBank's $1.54 billion in deposits and most of its $2.16 billion in assets. The FDIC and Urban Partnership Bank shared the losses of $1.41 billion of those assets at 20% and 80%, respectively.Chicago's ShoreBank fails, is bought by investors The new bank was capitalized with nearly $140 million.Execs position former ShoreBank for growth. In July 2011 Urban Partnership Bank was certified as a community development financial institution (CDFI). As such, other institutions could receive Community Reinvestment Act credit for depositing their funds in the bank. It was eligible to apply for programs through the CDFI Fund that support its mission to revitalize its urban neighborhoods. Urban Partnership Bank was also certified as a Minority Depository Institution (MDI), which meant that the bank was working towards improving and strengthening the community's overall well-being. Operations history After enduring significant losses every year since its creation, the bank moved to cut its operating costs in 2016 by reducing its overall number of branches and employees. This resulted in stable fourth quarter numbers and the bank's first ever profit. In September 2018, Providence Bank & Trust of South Holland, Illinois, a bank with 12 branches in the greater Chicago area, announced that it would purchase Urban Partnership. The acquisition was completed on Jan 30, 2019.\\"Providence Bank & Trust Welcomes Urban Partnership Bank Customers\\" =Leadership= Urban Partnership Bank was led by a team of experienced financial services professionals with roots in the community.

Early life and education Francis Goold Morony Stoney was born on 5 April 1837 at Arran Hill (sometimes Arranhill), County Tipperary, the son of Thomas G. Stoney, a Justice of the peace. He was educated at Queen's College in Belfast before being articled to John Macneill, a railway engineer. Career Stoney later became manager of the Dundalk Ironworks. In 1865 he was employed by a Clyde- based shipbuilding company to work in Peru, on the Callao Floating Dock. He returned to England before departing for India in 1868, working as a contractor on the Madras Railway, and later as personal assistant to the Chief Engineer of the Madras Navigation and Canal Company. It was his involvement in this enterprise that elicited Stoney's interest in the design of sluices. In 1869 he worked on the design of a double-door sluice, but suffering from poor health he was forced to return to England, where he remained invalided for about two years. He stayed in contact with his previous employer though, designing and patenting several sluices, including an equilibrium sluice to work under 100 feet head. In 1873 he patented his cylindrical sluice, 28 of which were later used on the Weaver Navigation. Stoney's third patent was for his roller sluice, which offered a more practical solution than his previous inventions. At the time Stoney was employed as Chief Draughtsman for a company in Glasgow, but poor health again forced him to resign. In August 1876 he worked as a Consulting Engineer in Westminster. In 1878 he designed an award- winning steam-ferry which ran between Greenwich and Poplar, and in 1880 he designed a pier at Hove, but most of his efforts were directed toward the development and promotion of his roller sluice. About 1880 he patented a double-door roller sluice, suited for graving docks, and also a rolling flap- valve, used in tidal sewage outfalls. Four of Stoney's roller sluices were installed at Lough Erne in 1883. Many more, built by Ransomes and Rapier (for whom Stoney had been appointed works manager in 1887) were installed on the newly built Manchester Ship Canal, which opened in 1894. The resulting publicity increased the demand for Stoney's designs, leading to installations on the Rhone in Geneva, the River Thames at Richmond, and on the River Clyde at Glasgow. Stoney also worked on designs for steam cranes, introducing improvements to tipping cranes, some of which were used to dredge the Manchester Ship Canal. He died at Neuenahr in Germany, on 7 August 1897, aged 61.

In the summer of 1989 he signed for Atl√©tico Madrid, but returned to his previous club after only one season. From 1990 to 1993, Abad√≠a helped modest Logro√±√©s consecutively retain its top level status, netting a career-best ‚Äì both in the league and as a professional ‚Äì five goals in the 1992‚Äì93 campaign, two of those coming on 14 March 1993 as the team came from behind 0‚Äì2 at the Santiago Bernab√©u Stadium to draw 2‚Äì2 against Real Madrid. Aged 31, he signed for SD Compostela and achieved another first-ever promotion in his career in his first year, with the Galicia side reaching the top flight after finishing third and promoting in the playoffs against Rayo Vallecano, with the player appearing in all 270 minutes in the tie (two games and a third after the teams drew 1‚Äì1 on aggregate). After only appearing in 14 league matches in 1995‚Äì96 (only three starts), 34-year-old Abad√≠a returned again to Logro√±√©s, but this time could not help prevent his main club's top division relegation. He closed out his career with Bin√©far in 1999, winning another division four championship in his first season. Coaching career Abad√≠a started coaching with his last club, first at youth level, then successfully leading the team into safety in two consecutive third tier seasons. He started 2002‚Äì03 with Logro√±√©s' juniors, but was promoted to the main squad for the second division promotion playoffs, eventually falling short. Abad√≠a then managed Girona FC in level three, being sacked after round seven in his second season, which ended in relegation.

The yard is the major freight yard of the region, handling all of the rail freight movements from Port Talbot Steelworks, and most of the railfreight traffic around South Wales. Background Duffryn No.1 Yard, 1 June 1962 The development of Port Talbot as an industrial centre started from the turn of the 20th century. The need for iron and steel producers to now import both ore and fuel, brought about the development of Port Talbot Steelworks, Margam Steelworks and associated expansion of the Port of Port Talbot. In 1894, the Port Talbot Railway and Docks Company had been formed to directly link the port to the various competitive railways, particularly the South Wales Mineral Railway and the Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway; and the coal mines and ironworks in the surrounding Llynfi and Garw valley areas, via the Duffryn Llynvi and Porthcawl Railway. This facilitated a further extension to the dock facilities in 1898.railways The PTR&D; had developed extensive railway yards surrounding the docks, particularly the pair of Duffryn Yards, Duffryn No.1 and Duffryn No.2. The PTR&D; was absorbed by the Great Western Railway on 1 January 1922.South Wales Mineral Railway Development EWS Class 66 heads towards Margam Knuckle Yard with a load of steel empties By the 1950s, a combination of factors was bringing about the need for the redevelopment of transport facilities at Margam. The steelworks had integrated under the British Steel Corporation, and the post-war planned Abbey Works had opened in 1951, and was fully operational by 1953. Further increases in the volume of goods handling at the port were restricted by the docks inability to handle the new bulk carriers, with the old docks unable to accept a ship of greater than . In 1966, work commenced on the construction of the new Port Talbot Tidal Harbour, south-west of the existing docks system. Completed in 1970, it was the first dry-bulk cargo terminal in the UK capable of accepting ships in excess of . British Railways was modernising freight distribution, with the former bespoke creation of manually loaded wagons being replaced by larger, bogeyed bulk- freight wagons that were automatically loaded. This resulted in a need for both larger yards to handle the larger wagons, and fewer yards as high speed freight traffic ran between them to reduce speed of delivery for the customer. BSC was becoming BR's most important customer, with coal traffic quickly falling. Hence, in 1960 the development and construction of Margam Knuckle Yard on a former landfill site to the west, along the lines of the PTR&D; towards the Llynvi and Ogmore Railway, consolidated what was one of a series of new rail yard developments that supported major steel making facilities in the UK. The development at Margam also included the redevelopment of locomotive maintenance facilities, with the co-development of Margam TMD. Operations Merry-Go-Round coal hoppers, after leaving Margam Knuckle Yard The strategy of BSC had resulted in an integrated facility plan, with Port Talbot at the centre of steel making system: *4.7million tonnes of raw iron ore used at Port Talbot/Llanwern steelworks *3.0million tonnes of steel produced at Port Talbot *Steel output was then taken by railway to: **Shotton for coating **Trostre for tin plating **Ebbw Vale rolling and coating **Direct to the Midlands motor industry, via Toton Marshalling Yards However, British Rails biggest problem was the 1.7million tonnes of raw iron ore required to be transported by rail to Llanwern Steelworks. Marshalling 27 √ó 100-tonne iron ore tipplers, the train was initially headed by three Class 37/0's, which continually caused problems with their couplings. The amount of power was required to climb Stormy Bank, located just west of Margam, where the train would only reach at the top. Eventually replaced by two Class 56's, drivers reported that this combination could reach . After experimentation with two refurbished Class 37/7's, the company specially hired-in National Power's newly purchased Class 59/2. By January 2008, EWS was handling all 4.7million tonnes of steel product using either Class 60 or Class 66. With the closure of Margam TMD, locomotive maintenance had moved to Knuckle, with C-Class services and brake tests requiring locomotives to be shipped to Toton TMD. Margam Knuckle handles other goods shipped through the port, as well as regional traffic including shipments to/from RNAD Trecwn. The yard is about east of Port Talbot Parkway, with few facilities and no bridges by which rail spotters can see operations.

It contains information about the processing and the processing state of proteins and functional implications thereof derived from research literature, contributions by the scientific community and biological databases. Background Among the most fundamental characteristics of a protein are the N- and C-termini defining the start and end of the polypeptide chain. While genetically encoded, protein termini isoforms are also often generated during translation, following which, termini are highly dynamic, being frequently trimmed at their ends by a large array of exopeptidases. Neo-termini can also be generated by endopeptidases after precise and limited proteolysis, termed processing. Necessary for the maturation of many proteins, processing can also occur afterwards, often resulting in dramatic functional consequences. Aberrant proteolysis can cause wide range of diseases like arthritis or cancer. Hence, proteolytic generation of pleiotrophic stable forms of proteins, the universal susceptibility of proteins to proteolysis, and its irreversibility, distinguishes proteolysis from many highly studied posttranslational modifications. Proteases are tightly interconnected in the protease web and their aberrant activity in disease can lead to diagnostic fragment profiles with characteristic protein termini. Following proteolysis, the newly formed protein termini can be further modified, a process that affects protein function and stability. Knowledgebase content TopFIND is a resource for comprehensive coverage of protein N- and C-termini discovered by all available in silico, in vitro as well as in vivo methodologies. It makes use of existing knowledge by seamless integration of data from UniProt and MEROPS and provides access to new data from community submission and manual literature curating. It renders modifications of protein termini, such as acetylation and citrullination, easily accessible and searchable and provides the means to identify and analyse extend and distribution of terminal modifications across a protein. Since its inception TopFIND has been expanded to further species. Data access The data is presented to the user with a strong emphasis on the relation to curated background information and underlying evidence that led to the observation of a terminus, its modification or proteolytic cleavage. In brief the protein information, its domain structure, protein termini, terminus modifications and proteolytic processing of and by other proteins is listed. All information is accompanied by metadata like its original source, method of identification, confidence measurement or related publication. A positional cross correlation evaluation matches termini and cleavage sites with protein features (such as amino acid variants) and domains to highlight potential effects and dependencies in a unique way. Also, a network view of all proteins showing their functional dependency as protease, substrate or protease inhibitor tied in with protein interactions is provided for the easy evaluation of network wide effects. A powerful yet user friendly filtering mechanism allows the presented data to be filtered based on parameters like methodology used, in vivo relevance, confidence or data source (e.g. limited to a single laboratory or publication). This provides means to assess physiological relevant data and to deduce functional information and hypotheses relevant to the bench scientist. In a later release analysis tools for the evaluation of proteolytic pathways in experimental data have been added.

The species is solely known from the Middle Eocene, Lutetian stage, Parachute Member, part of the Green River Formation, in the Piceance Creek Basin and Uinta Basin, Garfield County, northwestern Colorado, USA. History and classification The species is known from a series of eighteen fossils, the holotype, three paratype females, ten male paratypes, and three paratypes of indeterminate sex. The holotype, number \\"USNM 31487\\", is a single female specimen consisting of part and counterpart fossils. All of the type specimens plus an additional male specimen tentatively identified as belonging to A. protomaculata are currently preserved in the Department of Paleobiology collections housed in the National Museum of Natural History, located in Washington, D.C., USA. A. protomaculata was first studied by Michael S. Engel of the University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas, USA. His 2009 type description of the new species was published in the journal Transactions of the Kansas Academy of Science. Engel coined the specific epithet protomaculata as a combination of the Latin word \\"protos\\" meaning \\"first\\" and \\"macula\\" meaning \\"mark\\". At least one other specimen is known and was figured in a 1995 publication by Dayvault et al, but that specimen is thought to still be in the private collection of William Hawes. At the time of the species description, Agulla protomaculata was the only member of the order Raphidioptera to be described from the Green River Formation. Description Specimens of Agulla protomaculata average in length not including the ovipositor in the females. Overall the species was a dark brown to brown coloration, with the legs shading from light brown to a yellow tone. The head is dark brown with extensive yellow coloration including yellow stripes along the sides and to the rear of the eyes, and a central stripe of yellow running down the center of the head behind the eyes. In females the gentility curved ovipositor is light brown and ranges between in length. The wings are hyaline in coloration with a slight darkening of the pterostigma and averaging long for the fore- wings. The vein structure of the fore-wing and notably the length and placement of the M vein in the hind-wing indicate the species to be a member of the genus Agulla.

Alexander focused most of his time and creativity on poetry, and it is for this that he is best known. Early life, education and style Lewis Alexander was born July 4, 1900, in Washington D.C. As a child, he was educated in the Washington public school system. Little biographical information is available on Alexander until, at the age of 17, he began writing poetry; he took special interest in Japanese forms including haiku, hokku, and tanka. Alexander went on to study at Howard University in Washington D.C. where he was an active member of the Howard Players, the school's theater group. He later continued his studies at the University of Pennsylvania. Alexander expressed a special interest in Japanese forms and he is one of few Black American poets to write in these styles. \\"The FIRE!! poems of Hughes, Helene Johnson, and Lewis Alexander deserve recognition as important modernist verse because they make key forms of modernist poetry - free verse, imagism, and dramatic monologue - into racial critique\\" Davis, Alex. The Cambridge companion to modernist poetry (45). Cambridge University Press, eBook Poetry and publication Alexander's notoriety as a poet can best be exemplified by his publications in many popular journals and magazines. Throughout his career, he was published regularly with other major Harlem Renaissance figures such as Langston Hughes, Gwendolyn Bennett, and Countee Cullen. Alexander wrote an article on the topic of Japanese hokku that was published, along with two of his poems, in the December 1923 edition of The Crisis.Dubois, W.E.B. \\"Japanese Hokku.\\" Crisis. Dec 1923: 67-68. Web. 22 Sep. 2011 He was published several times in Opportunity: Journal of Negro Life, a popular literary magazine associated with the Harlem Renaissance edited by Charles S. Johnson, from 1925 to 1929. The first of these appearances occurred in a trio of African-themed poems alongside poems by Langston Hughes and Claude McKay. His poem, \\"Enchantment,\\" was published in the Alain Locke's famous anthology, The New Negro. Alexander's most popularly anthologized work, a short poem entitled \\"Negro Woman\\" was published in Opportunity at least twice and appears in multiple anthologies\\"Opportunity.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2011. Web. 22 Sep. 2011 In 1927, Alexander, along with many other poets (most notably Langston Hughes) and writers set out to create a literary quarterly expressing the Black experience in America. Unfortunately, Fire!! only produced one issue due to the burning of the magazine's headquarters. In this one issue, Alexander published two poems: \\"Little Cinderella\\", a poem often thought to be about a young, black prostitute, and another short verse entitled \\"Streets\\". Alexander was also published outside of the United States. In October 1926, he appeared in a special issue of The Palms, a poetic journal based in Guadalajara, Mexico. This special issue, edited by Countee Cullen included two poems by Alexander, \\"A Collection of Japanese Hokku\\" and \\"Dream Song\\". Contribution to the Harlem Renaissance Although Alexander did not live in Harlem, he was an active participant in the Harlem Renaissance movement. His location outside of Harlem helped to spread the inventive new thinking that flourished at the time in New York City. After writing extensively in Washington, Alexander moved around the country and joined whichever literary circle that existed in his new city. In Philadelphia, he was associated with a group of young writers who were commonly published in the small-time Black Opals literary magazine. In Boston he appeared in the Saturday Evening Quill. Alexander was influential at the University of North Carolina where he served as honorary editor for special issues of The Carolina Magazine, the official literary publication of the students of the University, which featured black poets and writers. With Alexander's help (he selected works from Crisis and Opportunity writing and poetry contest ), the magazine continued to publish Negro Poetry Numbers and Negro Play Numbers. The continued issues of Negro Poetry Numbers were dedicated to Alexander. Theater Although he is best known for his work as a poet, Alexander was also a playwright, actor, and costume designer. After participating in the theater while attending Howard University, Alexander joined the play writers circle of Washington D.C. There, he directed all the plays put on the Randall Community Center in Washington as well as all the plays put on by the Ira Aldridge Players. He studied and toured with The Ethiopian Art Theatre/Players. During their 1923 tour, in which they opened for Broadway, Alexander appeared in Oscar Wilde's Salome and Shakespeare's The Comedy of Errors.Salome - 1923 Broadway - Original Broadway Cast on BroadwayWorld.com References Lewis Grandison Alexander on \\"The Black Renaissance in Washington, 1920-1930s\\" website Further reading Hans Ostrom. \\"Lewis Alexander,\\" in The Greenwood Encyclopedia of African American Literature.

It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents. Elasticsearch is developed in Java. Following an open-core business model, parts of the software are licensed under various open-source licenses (mostly the Apache License), while other parts fall under the proprietary (source-available) Elastic License. Official clients are available in Java, .NET (C#), PHP, Python, Apache Groovy, Ruby and many other languages. According to the DB-Engines ranking, Elasticsearch is the most popular enterprise search engine followed by Apache Solr, also based on Lucene. History Shay Banon created the precursor to Elasticsearch, called Compass, in 2004. While thinking about the third version of Compass he realized that it would be necessary to rewrite big parts of Compass to \\"create a scalable search solution\\". So he created \\"a solution built from the ground up to be distributed\\" and used a common interface, JSON over HTTP, suitable for programming languages other than Java as well. Shay Banon released the first version of Elasticsearch in February 2010. Elastic NV was founded in 2012 to provide commercial services and products around Elasticsearch and related software. In June 2014, the company announced raising $70 million in a Series C funding round, just 18 months after forming the company. The round was led by New Enterprise Associates (NEA). Additional funders include Benchmark Capital and Index Ventures. This round brought total funding to $104M. In March 2015, the company Elasticsearch changed their name to Elastic. In June 2018, Elastic filed for an initial public offering with an estimated valuation of between 1.5 and 3 billion dollars. On 5 October 2018, Elastic was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Features Elasticsearch can be used to search all kinds of documents. It provides scalable search, has near real- time search, and supports multitenancy. \\"Elasticsearch is distributed, which means that indices can be divided into shards and each shard can have zero or more replicas. Each node hosts one or more shards, and acts as a coordinator to delegate operations to the correct shard(s). Rebalancing and routing are done automatically\\". Related data is often stored in the same index, which consists of one or more primary shards, and zero or more replica shards. Once an index has been created, the number of primary shards cannot be changed. Elasticsearch is developed alongside a data collection and log-parsing engine called Logstash, an analytics and visualisation platform called Kibana, and Beats, a collection of lightweight data shippers. The four products are designed for use as an integrated solution, referred to as the \\"Elastic Stack\\" (formerly the \\"ELK stack\\"). Elasticsearch uses Lucene and tries to make all its features available through the JSON and Java API. It supports facetting and percolating, \\"Percolating\\" is a term peculiar to Elasticsearch. Percolating is a reverse search: instead of returning all the documents that match a search query, percolating returns all the (stored) search queries that match a document as their output. Nunn, Xavier; \\"Detecting data leaks in real time with a custom percolator\\", Serena Capital blogs, 2019-January-8 which can be useful for notifying if new documents match for registered queries. Another feature is called \\"gateway\\" and handles the long-term persistence of the index; for example, an index can be recovered from the gateway in the event of a server crash. Elasticsearch supports real-time GET requests, which makes it suitable as a NoSQL datastore, but it lacks distributed transactions. On 20 May 2019, Elastic made the core security features of the Elastic Stack available free of charge, including TLS for encrypted communications, file and native realm for creating and managing users, and role-based access control for controlling user access to cluster APIs and indexes. The corresponding source code is available under the ‚ÄúElastic License‚Äù, a source-available license. In addition, Elasticsearch now offers SIEM and Machine Learning as part of its offered services. Managed services Developed from the Found acquisition by Elastic in 2015, Elastic Cloud is a family of Elasticsearch- powered SaaS offerings which include the Elasticsearch Service, as well as Elastic App Search Service, and Elastic Site Search Service which were developed from Elastic‚Äôs acquisition of Swiftype. In late 2017, Elastic formed partnerships with Google to offer Elastic Cloud in GCP, and Alibaba to offer Elasticsearch and Kibana in Alibaba Cloud. Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud is the official hosted and managed Elasticsearch and Kibana offering from the creators of the project since August 2018 Elasticsearch Service users can create secure deployments with partners, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Alibaba Cloud. AWS offers Elasticsearch as a managed service since 2015. Such managed services provide hosting, deployment, backup and other support. Most managed services also include support for Kibana. Elasticsearch is the basis of Pangeanic's contribution to the EU's Marie Curie research project \\"EXPERT\\" called ActivaTM. Pangeanic built a bilingual database compatible with Computer-Assisted Translation tools, which could offer real-time access via API from a variety of tools. The project received further funding from the EU as the National and European Central Translation Memory project under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) programme. NEC TM aims to centralise national translation assets in all the EU's Member States so countries can re-use bilingual translation data produced as a result of public procurement contracts.

It was the first Italian Faculty of Theology extra urbem (outside Rome). History On 14 May 1612, Claudio Acquaviva, Superior General of the Society of Jesus, raised the college of Sassari to the status of a University of Ecclesiastic Law in order to confer the academic grades in Philosophy and Theology. Five years later, in 1617, by decree of King Philip III of Spain, it became a University by royal law with the same two faculties. On 12 February 1607, Pope Paul V promoted the college of Cagliari to University. The promotion was later confirmed by Philip III in 1620, but the courses could start only in 1626. By that time, Cagliari already had all the Faculties expected by the University regulations of that epoch. Under Philip IV of Spain, Sassari completed its Faculties in 1632 and obtained a few years later the pontifical recognition for the Faculty of Canon Law. The Society of Jesus had an active participation in both Sardinian Universities until its dissolution in 1773. In 1873,Law no. 1251 by 26 January 1873. the Faculties of Theology within the Universities of the Kingdom of Italy were suppressed. With the Papal Brief Innumera splendidaque by 1 December 1876, Pope Pius IX founded the theological colleges within the seminars of Cagliari and Sassari, authorizing them to release the academic grades of Baccalaureate, Licence and Doctorate. With the Apostolic Constitution Nostrarum partem of 5 August 1927, Pope Pius XI founded in Cuglieri ‚Äì along with the Pontifical Major Seminary accorded to the Society of Jesus ‚Äì the two Faculties of Theology and Philosophy which were supposed to extend the activity already started in the Universities of Cagliari and Sassari. A few years later, due to a lack of funds, the Faculty of Philosophy was suppressed while only the Faculty of Theology was kept. After the renewal promoted by Second Vatican Council, which required the Ecclesiastic Faculties to revise their regulations, the Faculty of Theology of Sardinia undertook the reworking of its charters. Once a temporary approval was obtained by the Congregation for Catholic Education, on 2 February 1974, the charters were conformed to the mandate of the Apostolic Constitution Sapientia christiana, promulgated by John Paul II on 15 April 1979, to be definitively approved on 25 March 1987. In the academic year 1971-1972, the Faculty of Theology was moved to Cagliari, where it still has its registered office. In the academic year 1972-1973, the Congregation for Catholic Education entrusted the Sardinian Episcopal Conference with the running of the Faculty. On that occasion, a six-year agreement, renewable and still effective, was signed with the Society of Jesus, through which the Society of Jesus was put in charge of the academic direction of the Faculty. On 12 March 1999, the Faculty of Theology was enrolled in the Register for Legal Personalities within the Law Court of Cagliari.Ministerial Decree by 7 December 1998. The Pontifical Faculty of Theology of Sardinia made an agreement with the University of CagliariAgreement signed on 9 February 1993 and renewed on 15 November 2004. according to which the students of both institutions can freely attend courses and take exams at the two Universities. Faculty The Faculty of Theology of Sardinia academically depends upon the Congregation for Catholic Education of the Holy See. It is structured into four Departments: Philosophy and Human Sciences, Biblical and Patristic Sciences, Systematics and Liturgy, Practical Theology. The Faculty confers the degrees of Baccalaureate (a 3-year-BA degree), Licence (a 2-year-MA degree), and Doctorate (a 3-year-PhD degree). The Licence degree, which has the specialization in \\"Systematic Theology ‚Äì Christian Thought and Inculturation\\", focuses on the relationship between the doctrine (systematic and biblical courses) and its reception in time (historical courses) and in space (practical/pastoral courses). The Faculty is frequented both by clerics and laics (by now in a ratio of 50%), thanks also to an agreement of cooperation with the University of Cagliari.Annuario della Pontificia Facolt√† Teologica della Sardegna, LXXXIV (2010/2011), pp. 13-14. The library has more than 150,000 volumes and 250 current journals, and it is specialized in Theology, Biblical Sciences, Canon Law, Philosophy, Patristic, Christian Archaeology, History of Christianity and Church, Liturgy, Spirituality and Bioethics. The Faculty publishes the annual journal Theologica & Historica and a number of academic book series such as Studi e Ricerche di Cultura Religiosa, Limine (Dept. of Philosophy and Human Sciences) and Handbooks.

Initial characterization of the technique was credited to University of Texas electrochemist, Allen J. Bard, in 1989. Since then, the theoretical underpinnings have matured to allow widespread use of the technique in chemistry, biology and materials science. Spatially resolved electrochemical signals can be acquired by measuring the current at an ultramicroelectrode (UME) tip as a function of precise tip position over a substrate region of interest. Interpretation of the SECM signal is based on the concept of diffusion-limited current. Two-dimensional raster scan information can be compiled to generate images of surface reactivity and chemical kinetics. The technique is complementary to other surface characterization methods such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR), electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (ESTM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) in the interrogation of various interfacial phenomena. In addition to yielding topographic information, SECM is often used to probe the surface reactivity of solid-state materials, electrocatalyst materials, enzymes and other biophysical systems. SECM and variations of the technique have also found use in microfabrication, surface patterning, and microstructuring. History The emergence of ultramicroelectrodes (UMEs) around 1980 was pivotal to the development of sensitive electroanalytical techniques like SECM. UMEs employed as probes enabled the study of quick or localized electrochemical reactions. The first SECM-like experiment was performed in 1986 by Engstrom to yield direct observation of reaction profiles and short-lived intermediates. Simultaneous experiments by Allen J. Bard using an Electrochemical Scanning Tunneling Microscope (ESTM) demonstrated current at large tip-to-sample distances that was inconsistent with electron tunneling. This phenomenon was attributed to Faradaic current, compelling a more thorough analysis of electrochemical microscopy. The theoretical basis was presented in 1989 by Bard, where he also coined the term Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy. In addition to the simple collection modes used at the time, Bard illustrated the widespread utility of SECM through the implementation of various feedback modes. As the theoretical foundation developed, annual SECM-related publications steadily rose from 10 to around 80 in 1999, when the first commercial SECM became available. SECM continues to increase in popularity due to theoretical and technological advances that expand experimental modes while broadening substrate scope and enhancing sensitivity. Principles of operation Electric potential is manipulated through the UME tip in a bulk solution containing a redox-active couple (e.g. Fe2+/Fe3+). When a sufficiently negative potential is applied, (Fe3+) is reduced to (Fe2+) at the UME tip, generating a diffusion-limited current. The steady-state current is governed by the flux of oxidized species in solution to the UME disc and is given by: i_{T, \\\\infty} = 4nFCDa where iT,‚àû is the diffusion-limited current, n is the number of electrons transferred at the electrode tip (O + ne‚àí ‚Üí R), F is Faraday's constant, C is the concentration of the oxidized species in solution, D is the diffusion coefficient and a is the radius of the UME disc. In order to probe a surface of interest, the tip is moved closer to the surface and changes in current are measured. There are two predominant modes of operation, which are feedback mode and collection- generation mode. =Feedback mode= Feedback mode and approach curve In a bulk solution, the oxidized species is reduced at the tip, producing a steady- state current that is limited by hemispherical diffusion. As the tip approaches a conductive substrate in the solution, the reduced species formed at the tip is oxidized at the conductive surface, yielding an increase in the tip current and creating a regenerative \\"positive\\" feedback loop. The opposite effect is observed when probing insulating surfaces, as the oxidized species cannot be regenerated and diffusion to the electrode is inhibited as a result of physical obstruction as the tip approaches the substrate, creating a \\"negative\\" feedback loop and decreasing the tip current. An additional parameter to consider when probing insulating surfaces is the electrode sheath diameter, rg, since it contributes to the physical obstruction of diffusion. The change in tip current as a function of distance d can be plotted as an \\"approach curve\\" as shown. Due to the rate dependent nature of SECM measurements, it is also employed to study electron-transfer kinetics. =Collection-generation modes= Another mode of operation that is employed is tip generation/substrate collection (TG/SC). In TG/SC mode, the tip is held at a potential sufficient for an electrode reaction to occur and \\"generate\\" a product while the substrate is held at a potential sufficient for the electrode product to react with or be \\"collected\\" by the substrate. The reciprocal to this method is substrate generation/tip collection (SG/TC), where the substrate acts to generate a species that is measured at the tip. Both TG/SC and SG/TC variations are also categorized as \\"direct\\" modes. Two currents are generated: the tip current, iT, and the substrate current, iS. Since the substrate is generally much larger than the tip, the efficiency of collection, iS/iT, is 1 if no reactions occur during the transfer of tip- generated species to the substrate. As the distance between tip and substrate, d, decreases, the collection efficiency, iS/iT, approaches 1. = Alternating Current (ac)-SECM = In ac-SECM a sinusoidal bias is applied to the dc bias of the SECM probe allowing the impedance of a sample to be measured, as is the case in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Unlike dc-SECM techniques ac- SECM does not require the use of a redox mediator. This is particularly advantageous for measurements where the redox mediator could affect the chemistry of the system under study. Examples include corrosion studies where a redox mediator may act to inhibit or enhance the rate of corrosion, and biological studies where a redox mediator may be toxic to the living cell under study. In ac-SECM the feedback response measured is dependent on both the sample type and the experimental conditions. When a sample is insulating the measured impedance will always increase with decreasing probe to sample distance. This is not the case for a conductive sample however. For a conductive sample measured in a high conductivity electrolyte, or measured with a low ac frequency, decreasing the probe to sample distance will lead to an increase in impedance. If, however, a conductive sample is measured in a low conductivity electrolyte, or with a high ac frequency, decreasing the probe to sample distance will result in a lower measured impedance. SECM Electrode scanning in constant-height mode =SECM imaging= Changes in current as a function of distance between electrode tip and substrate surface allow imaging of insulating and conducting surfaces for topology and reactivity information by moving the tip across surfaces and measuring tip current. The most common scanning mode is constant-height mode, where the tip height is unchanging and is scanned across the surface in the x-y plane. Alternatively, constant distance measurements are possible, which change the z position to maintain the probe to sample distance as the probe is scanned across the surface in the x-y plane. The constant distance measurement can be based on an electrical signal as is the case in the constant-current mode, where the device attempts to maintain a constant current by changing the substrate to tip distance, d, and recording the change in d. A mechanical signal can also be used to control the probe to sample distance. Examples of this are the intermittent contact (ic)-SECM and shear force techniques which use changes in probe vibration to maintain the probe to sample distance. Spatial resolution is dependent on the tip radius, the substrate to tip distance, the precision of the electronics, and other considerations. Instrumentation Schematic of the fundamental devices involved in most SECM experiments. Experimental control is exercised through manipulation of the piezo controller and potential programmer, while data is collected through the bipotentiostat. Early SECMs were constructed solely by individual lab groups from a set of common components including potentiostat (or bipotentiostat) and potential programmer, current amplifier, piezoelectric positioner and controller, computer, and UME. Many SECM experiments are highly specific in nature, and in-house assembly of SECMs remains common. The development of new techniques toward the reliable nanofabrication of electrodes has been a primary focus in the literature due to several distinct advantages including high mass-transfer rates and low levels of reactant adsorption in kinetic experiments. Additionally, enhanced spatial resolution afforded by reduced tip size expands the scope of SECM studies to smaller and faster phenomena. The following methods encompass an abbreviated summary of fabrication techniques in a rapidly developing field. =Preparation of electrodes= (A) Schematics of an ultramicroelectrode. The exposed metal is the active part of the electrode. (B) Optical micrograph of a tip. The platinum wire (orange) is sealed inside a glass sheath. SECM probes use platinum as the active core material, however carbon, gold, mercury, and silver have all been used. Typical preparation of a microscale electrode is performed by heat sealing a microwire or carbon fiber in a glass capillary under vacuum. This tip can be connected to a larger copper electrode through the use of silver epoxy then polished to yield a sharpened tip. Nanofabrication of electrodes can be performed by etching a metal wire with sodium cyanide and sodium hydroxide. Etched metal wires can then be coated with wax, varnish, molten paraffin or glass, poly(a-methylstyrene), polyimide,P. Sun, Z. Zhang, J. Guo and Y. Shao, Anal. Chem., 2001, 73, 5346. electropolymerized phenol, and electrophoretic paint.C. J. Slevin, N. J. Gray, J. V. Macpherson, M. A. Webb and P. R. Unwin, Electrochem. Commun., 1999, 1, 282. Nanotips produced by these methods are conical, however disc-shaped tips can be obtained by micropipette pulling of glass sealed electrodes. Nanoscale electrodes allow for high resolution experiments of biological features of sub micron scale or single molecule analysis. \\"Penetration\\" experiments, where the tip is inserted into a microstructure (such as a thin polymer film with fixed redox centers) to probe kinetic and concentration parameters, also require the use of nanoscale electrodes.Amemiya S, Bard AJ, Fan FR, Mirkin MV, Unwin PR. Annu Rev Anal Chem (Palo Alto Calif). 2008;1:95-131. However, microelectrodes remain ideal for quantitative kinetic and feedback mode experiments due to their increased surface area. Modification of electrodes has developed beyond the size parameter. SECM-AFM probes can act as both a force sensor and electrode through the utilization of a flattened, etched metal wire coated by electrophoretic paint. In this system, the flattened wire acts as a flexible cantilever to measure the force against a sample (AFM) as the wire electrode measures the current (SECM). Similarly, SECM functionality can be imparted into standard AFM probes by sputtering the surface with a conductive metal or by milling an insulated tip with a focused ion beam (FIB). Electron-beam lithography has also been demonstrated to reproducibly generate SECM-AFM probes using silicon wafers.Dobson P S, Weaver J M R, Holder M N, Unwin P R and Macpherson J V 2005 Characterization of batch microfabricated scanning electrochemical‚Äìatomic force microscopy probes Anal.

Lamination with a polymer film produced v-shaped stylus that was cut to expose the carbon tip. The flexibility inherent in the probe design allows for constant contact with the substrate that bends the probe. When dragged across a sample, probe bending accommodates for topographical differences in the substrate and provides a quasi-constant tip-to-substrate distance, d.Fernando Cort√©s- Salazar, Markus Tr√§uble, Fei Li, Jean-Marc Busnel, Anne-Laure Gassner, Mohamad Hojeij, Gunther Wittstock, Hubert H Girault. \\"Soft Stylus Probes for Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy\\" Analytical Chemistry Vol. 18, Issue 16. Date: 08/15/2009 Start Page: 6889. Micro-ITIES probes represent another type of specialty probe that utilizes the Interface between Two Immiscible Electrolyte Solutions (ITIES). These tips feature a tapered pipette containing a solution containing a metal counter electrode, and are used to measure electron and ion transfer events when immersed in a second, immiscible liquid phase containing a counter-reference electrode. Often the probing of liquid/liquid and air/liquid interfaces via SECM require the use of a submarine electrode. In this configuration, the electrode is fashioned into a hook shape where the electrode can be inverted and submerged within the liquid layer. The UME tip points upwards and can be positioned directly beneath the liquid/liquid or air/liquid interface. The portion of the electrode passing through the interface region is electrically insulated to prevent indirect interfacial perturbations. Increases in the complexity of electrodes along with decreases in size have prompted the need for high resolution characterization techniques. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and SECM approach curve measurements are frequently applied to identify the dimension and geometry of fabricated probes. =Potentiostat= The potentiostat biases and measures the voltage using the standard three electrode system of voltammetry experiments. The UME acts as the working electrode to apply a controlled potential to the substrate. The auxiliary electrode (or counter electrode) acts to balance the current generated at the working electrode, often through a redox reaction with the solvent or supporting electrolyte. Voltage measured with regard to the well defined reduction potential of the reference electrode, although this electrode itself does not pass any current. =Positioners and translators= SECM utilizes many of the same positioning components that are available to other materials characterization techniques. Precise positioning between the tip and sample is an important factor that is complementary to tip size. The position of the probe relative to a given point on the material surface in the x, y, and z directions is typically controlled by a motor for rough positioning coupled with a piezoelectric motor for finer control. More specifically, systems may feature an inchworm motor that directs coarse positioning with additional z control governed by a PZT piezo pusher. Stepper motors with XYZ piezo block positioner or closed-loop controller systems have also been used. Applications SECM has been employed to probe the topography and surface reactivity of solid-state materials, track the dissolution kinetics of ionic crystals in aqueous environments, screen electrocatalytic prospects, elucidate enzymatic activities, and investigate dynamic transport across synthetic/natural membranes and other biophysical systems. Early experiments focused on these solid/liquid interfaces and the characterization of typical solution-based electrochemical systems at higher spatial resolution and sensitivities than bulk electrochemical experiments typically afford. More recently the SECM technique has been adapted to explore the chemical transfer dynamics at liquid/liquid and liquid/gas interfaces. =Solid/Liquid Interface= Microstructuring SECM and variations of the technique have also found use in microfabrication, surface patterning, and microstructuring. A multitude of surface reactions within this context have been explored including metal deposition, etching and patterning of surfaces by enzymes. Scanning probe lithography (SPL) of surfaces can be performed using the SECM configuration. Due to size limitations in the microfabrication procedures for the UMEs, spatial resolution is decreased, affording larger feature sizes compared to other SPL techniques. An early example demonstrated patterning of dodecylthiolate self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) by moving the UME in a two-dimensional array in close proximity to the surface while applying an oxidative or reductive potential, thus locally desorbing the chemical species. Micron-sized features were effectively patterned into the SAM. An inherent benefit of SECM over other SPL techniques for surface patterning can be attributed to its ability to simultaneously acquire surface- related electrochemical information while performing lithography. Other studies have demonstrated the utility of SECM for the deposition of local gold islands as templates for attachment of biomolecules and fluorescent dyes. Such studies are suggestive of the technique‚Äôs potential for the fabrication of nanoscale assemblies, making it particularly suited to explore previously studied systems tethered to small gold clusters. Varieties of SECM employing the micropipet tip geometry have been used to generate spatially resolved microcrystals of a solid solution. Here, glass microcapillaries with sub- micron sized orifices replace the standard UME allowing femtoliter-sized droplets to be suspended from the capillary over a conductive surface acting as the working electrode. Upon contact with the positively biased surface, the droplets of salt solutions achieve supersaturation and crystallize with well- defined, microscale geometries. Such technology could lend itself well to solid-state electrochemical sensors on microdevices. Ionic dissolution Ionic dissolution of crystal by local reduction of Mn+ The dissolution of ionic crystals in aqueous environments is fundamentally important to the characterization of a host of naturally occurring and synthetic systems. The high spatial resolution and three-dimensional mobility provided by the UME allows one to probe the dissolution kinetics on specific faces of single ionic crystals, whereas previous characterization techniques relied on a bulk or ensemble average measurement. Due to the high mass transfer rates associated with UMEs in the SECM configuration, it is possible to quantify systems defined by very fast reaction kinetics. In addition, UMEs allow monitoring over a wide dynamic range, making possible the study of ionic solids with large differences in solubility. Early examples demonstrating the utility of SECM to extract quantitative rate data from such systems was carried out on CuSO4 crystals in an aqueous solution saturated with Cu2+ and ions. By positioning an UME in the SECM configuration approximately one-electrode radius away from the (100) face of a CuSO4 crystal, it was possible to perturb the dissolution equilibrium by locally reducing Cu2+ at the UME surface. As the crystal face locally dissolved into copper and sulfate ions, a visible pit was formed and the chronoamperometric signal could be monitored as a function of distance between the UME and the crystal. Assuming first or second order kinetic behavior, the dissolution rate constant could then be extracted from the data. Similar studies have been performed on additional crystal systems without a supporting electrolyte. Electrocatalysis investigation Approaching the search for novel catalytic materials to replace precious metals used in fuel cells demands extensive knowledge of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) occurring at the metal surface. Often even more pressing are the physical limitations imposed by the need to survey and assess the electrocatalytic viability of large numbers of potential catalytic candidates. Some groups studying electrocatalysis have demonstrated the use of SECM as a rapid screening technique that provides local quantitative electrochemical information about catalytic mixtures and materials. A variety of approaches have been suggested for high throughput assessment of novel metallic electrocatalysts. One functional, non-SECM approach, enabled the electocatalytic activities of a large number of catalysts to be assessed optically by employing a technique that detected proton production on deposited arrays of proton-sensitive fluorescent dyes. Though of certain utility, the technique suffers from the failure to extract quantitative electrochemical information from any catalytic system of interest, thus requiring the quantitative electrochemical information to be obtained off-line from the array experiment. Bard et al. have demonstrated assessment of electrocatalytic activities at high volume using the SECM configuration. With this approach, direct quantitative electrochemical information from multicomponent systems can be acquired on a rapid screening platform. Such high throughput screening significantly assists the search for abundant, efficient and cost-effective electrocatalytic materials as substitutes for platinum and other precious metals. Biological analysis Substrate imaging (constant current mode). (A) SECM image of a portion (10 ¬µm √ó 10 ¬µm) of a human breast cell using a 120 nm radius tip. (B) Optical micrograph of the same cell showing the SECM image area delimited by a white square. SECM The ability to probe non-conductive surfaces makes SECM a feasible method for analyzing membranes, redox active enzymes, and other biophysical systems. Changes in intracellular redox activity may be related to conditions such as oxidative stress and cancer. Redox processes of individual living cells can be probed by SECM, which serves as a non-invasive method for monitoring intracellular charge transfer. In such measurements, the cell of interest is immobilized on a surface submerged in a solution with the oxidized form of the redox mediator and feedback mode is employed. A potential is applied to the tip, which reduces the oxidized species, generating a steady-state current, iT. When the tip product enters the cell, it is re-oxidized by processes within the cell and sent back out. Depending on the rate at which tip product is regenerated by the cell, the tip current will change. A study by Liu et al. employed this method and showed that the redox states within three human breast cell lines (nonmotile, motile, and metastatic) were consistently different. SECM can not only examine immobilized cells, but also be used to study the kinetics of immobilized redox-active enzymes. Transport of ions such as K+ and Na+ across membranes or other biological interfaces is vital to many cell processes; SECM has been employed in studying transport of redox active species across cell membranes. In feedback mode, the transfer of molecules across a membrane can be induced by collecting the transferred species at the tip and forming a concentration gradient. The changes in current can be measured as a function of molecule transport rate. =Liquid/liquid interface= Electrocatalysis The interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (ITIES) can be studied using SECM with a micro-ITIES probe. The probe lies in one layer, and is moved closer to the junction while applying a potential. Oxidation or reduction depletes the substrate concentration, resulting in diffusion from either layer. At close tip- interface distances, rates of diffusion between the organic/aqueous layer for a substrate or ionic species are observed. Electron transfer rates have also been studied extensively at the ITIES. In such experiments, redox couples are dissolved in separate phases and the current at the ITIES is recorded. This is also the fundamental principle in studying transport across membranes. =Liquid/gas interface= The transfer of chemical species across air/liquid interfaces is integral to almost every physical, physiological, biological and environmental system on some level. Thus far, a major thrust in the field has been the quantification of molecular transfer dynamics across monolayer films in order to gain insight into chemical transport properties of cellular membrane systems and chemical diffusion at environmental interfaces. Though much work has been done in the area of evaporation through monolayers at air/water interfaces, it was the introduction of SECM that provided researchers an alternative method for exploring the permeability of monolayers to small solute molecules across such interfaces. By precisely positioning a submarine electrode beneath an organic monolayer that separates an air/water interface, researchers were able to perturb the oxygen diffusion equilibrium by local reduction of oxygen in the aqueous layer, thereby eliciting diffusion across the monolayer. Diffusion dynamics of the system can be elucidated by measuring the current response at the UME with high spatial and temporal resolution. SECM is quite amenable to such kinetics studies since the current response can be monitored with high sensitivity due to the rapid mass transfer rates associated with UMEs in the SECM configuration. The three dimensional mobility of the UME also affords spatial probing of membranes to identify points of high flux or permeability. A very similar approach has been employed for diffusion studies at liquid/liquid and solid/liquid interfaces.

Chiral bis(amino acid)- and bis(amino alcohol)-oxalamide Gelators. Gelation Properties, Self- Assembly Motifs and Chirality Effects‚Äù 2010 Chem. Commun. 46, 522-537. SAFINs arise from the formation of strong non-covalent interactions between LMOG monomeric sub-units. As SAFINs are forming, the long fibers become intertwined and trap solvent molecules. Once solvent molecules are entrapped within the network, they are immobilized by surface tension effects. The stability of a gel is dependent on the equilibrium between the assembled network and the dissolved gelators. One characteristic of an LMOG, that demonstrates its stability, is its ability to contain an organic solvent at the boiling point of that solvent due to extensive solvent-fibrillar interactions.Hafkamp, R. J. H.; Feiters, M. C.; Nolte, R. J. 1999 J. Org. Chem. 64, 412. Gels self- assemble through non-covalent interactions such as œÄ-stacking, hydrogen- bonding, or Van der Waals interactions to form volume-filling 3D networks. Self-assembly is key to gel formation and dependent upon reversible bond formation. The propensity of a low molecular weight molecule to form LMOGs is classified by its Minimum Gelation Concentration (MGC). The MGC is the lowest possible gelator concentration needed to form a stable gel. A lower MGC is desired to minimize the amount of gelator material needed to form gels. Super gelators have a MGC of less than 1 wt%. Gels can be organized according to multiple characteristics. The source of the gel (natural/artificial), the gel's medium (organic/aqueous/areo/xero), the constitution of the gel (macromolecular/supramolecular), and the type of crosslinking the gel forms (physical/chemical). Background and significance LMOGs were first reported in the 1930s, but advances in the field were more often than not discoveries of chance; as there existed little theoretical understanding of gel formation. During this time LMOGs found applications in thickening lubricants, printing inks, and napalm.Esch, J. H. We Can Design Molecular Gelators, But Do We Understand Them? 2009 Langmuir 25(15), 8392-8394. Interest in the field dwindled for several decades until the mid-1990s when Hanabusa, Shinkai, and Hamilton designed numerous LMOGs which form thermoreversible intermolecular amide-carbonyl hydrogen bonds.Hanabusa, K.; Tange, J.; Taguchi, Y.; Koyama, T.; Shirai, H.Small Molecular Gelling Agents to Harden Organic Liquids: Alkylamide of N-Benzyloxycarbonyl-L-valyl-L-valine 1993 J. Chem. Soc. Commun., 390. The LMOGs developed by Hanabusa et. al were suitable for forming hard gels, including gels with chloroform, which had been resistant to gelation prior to their discovery. These new LMOGs were rationally designedSupramolecular gelling agents: can they be designed? P Dastidar, Chem. Soc. Rev., 2008,37, 2699-2715 and represented the first time that scientists had been able to discover new LMOGs based on supramolecular principles. From these earliest studies and screening numerous compounds, it was determined that for thermoreversible gels based on the amide-carbonyl hydrogen bond, amino acid structure, enantiopurity, hydrophilic-lypophilic ratio, and increasing peptide substitution greatly affected the gelling ability of various new compounds. The aforementioned principles that developed in this field's infancy have proved successful in allowing researchers to tune LMOGs for different functions. Today, LMOGs have been extensively studied for their unique properties. This newfound functional diversity has led to a wide range of possible applications for LMOGs in agriculture, drug delivery, pollutant/heavy metal remediation, luminescent devices, and chemical sensing. Gel formation and morphology A LMOG liquid mixture forming a gel upon heating and cooling. Making a gel The majority of LMOGs can be triggered to form by manipulating the systems' properties, such as the pH, solvent, exposure to light, or by introducing oxidizing or reducing reagents.Bai, H.; Li, C.; Wang, X.; Shi, G. A pH-Sensitive Graphene Oxide Composite Hydrogel 2010 Chem. Commun. 46, 2376-2378. Researchers have proposed a set of guidelines for successful gel formation :1. It is necessary to have the presence of strong self-complementary and unidirectional inter-molecular interactions that can enforce 1D self-assembly. :2. The solvent-fiber interfacial energy should be manipulated to control solubility and prevent crystallization of the LMOG. :3. Some other factor must be present that can induce the fiber cross-linking network formation. Traditionally, gel phase transitions are strictly temperature dependent. However, it has recently been shown that non-liquid crystalline gelators, composed of (R)-18-(n-alkylamino)octadecan-7-ols (HSN-n), undergo first order gel-to-gel phase transitions; leading to different morphologies of the gel in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4).Mallia, V.A.; Butler, P. D.; Sarkar, B.; Holman, K. T.; Weiss, R. G. \\"Reversible Phase Transitions Within Self-Assembled Fibrillar Networks of (R)-18-(n-alkylamino)octadecan-7-ols in Their Carbon Tetrachloride Gels\\" 2011 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 133, 15045-15054. The uniqueness of this discovery stems from the idea that it is the solvent molecules entering and exiting the structure which leads to the different structural morphologies. All other previously known gel phase transitions have occurred as the result of temperature changes and only one previous case documents this type of solvent dependent morphological change. However, even in the case of N-isopropylacrylamide hydrogels that underwent conformational changes (folding and unfolding of their polymer chains); it occurred only via a temperature dependent process which resulted in water molecules, near the structure, entering or exiting the structure.Schild, H. G. 1992 Prog. Polym. Sci. 17, 163‚Äì249.Hirokawa, Y.; Tanaka, T. J. 1984 Chem. Phys. 81, 6379‚Äì6380.Zhang, X.-Z.; Xu, X.-D.; Cheng, S.-X.; Zhuo, R.-X. 2008 Soft Matter 4, 385‚Äì391.Qiu, Y.; Park, K. 2001 Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 53, 321‚Äì339. The stability of a formed gelation matrix is dependent on the equilibrium between the assembled network and the dissolved gelator assemblies. LMOGs are functionally diverse and can be composed of both polar and non-polar regions (amphiphiles). =Scanning electron microscopy= SEM of a Low Molecular Weight Gelator Scanning Electron Microscopy is a useful means for researchers to determine the structural properties of a low molecular-mass weight gel. These gels exhibit a wide range of structures; from fibrous strands (of various lengths) to ribbons and tubes. The structure of these gels is a key factor in their ability to gel solvents or water. Their tertiary structure determines the critical gelation concentration of the gel. Rheological measurements Generally, rheology is used to study the flow of matter within a substance. In order for a substance to be considered a gel it must possess solid-like traits when characterized by rheological measurements. Rheological characterization, tests materials by applying stress to measure the material's resistance to deformation. From rheological measurements, a gel can be classified as either a \\"strong\\" or \\"weak\\" gel. This classification emphasizes the strength of the interactions between gelator molecules in a particular gel. A \\"weak\\" gel is often not considered a true gel because it does not conform to a purely solid- like material's rheological traits. Instead, \\"weak\\" gels are generally better classified as viscoelastic liquids. As a result of this distinction, these classes of gels demonstrate different elasticity as calculated by the elastic modulus, a mathematical model for predicting the elasticity of different materials under different stressors. The shear modulus (G) of a \\"strong\\" gel exhibits a smaller dissipation of energy than \\"weak\\" gels, and the \\"strong\\" gel's G-values plateau for longer periods of time.Terech, P.; Weiss, R. G. Low Molecular Mass Gelators of Organic Liquids and the Properties of Their Gels \\"Chem. Rev.\\" 1997, 97, 3133-3159. Furthermore, rheological properties of different gels can occasionally be used to compare naturally occurring biopolymer gels with synthetic LMOGs.Burchard, W.; Ross-Murphy, S. B. '\\"Physical Networks, Polymers and Gels'\\" Elsevier: London, 1990 Interactions of gel and solvent Researchers have not been able to reliably predict novel LMOGs. A key aspect in predicting new gelator materials is understanding the interaction between the gel molecules and the solvent. The most common solvents for LMOGs are organic in nature and result in organogels. Much rarer are hydrogels, or gels that form with water as the solvent.Tritt-Goc, J.; Bielejewski, M.; Luboradzki, R. 2011 Tetrahedron, 67, 8170-8176 Several attempts have been made to quantify the gel and solvent interaction using a variety of parameters: :The single or multi-component solubility parameter (Œ¥) of a solvent can give insight on how well-suited the solvent will be for gelation. Depending on the gelator/solvent system, a high solubility parameter can indicate high or low thermal stability of the gel.Hanabasu, K.; Matsumoto, M.; Kimura, M,; Kakehi, A.; Shirai, H. 1999 Colloid Interface Science, 224, 231-244 :The dielectric constant (Œµ) reflects the bulk polarity of the solvent.Bielejewski, M.; Lapinski, A.; Luboradzki, R.; Tritt-Goc, J. 2009 Langmuir, 25, 8274-8279 :The Dimroth-Reichardt parameter (ET(30)) is a measure of ionizing power of a solvent.Muller P. \\"Glossary of Terms Used in Physical Organic Chemistry\\" 1994 Pure and Applied Chemistry 66(5), 1077-1184 :The Kamlet-Taft solvent parameters establish solvatochromic relationships which measure separately the hydrogen bond donor (Œ±), hydrogen bond acceptor (Œ≤), and polarizability (œÄ*) of solvents. :The Hildebrand parameter measures the energy it takes to create a cavity within a solvent. Applications =Agricultural industry= Pheromone release devicesJadhav, S. R.; Chiou, B.; Wood, D. F.; DeGrande-Hoffman, G.; Glenn, G. M.; John, G. \\"Molecular Gels- Based Controlled Release Devices for Pheromones\\" 2011 Soft Matter 7, 864-867. Multiple reservoir-type controlled release devices (CRDs) have been developed to achieve the controlled release of highly volatile pheromones into an agricultural setting; whereby they could act as pesticides throughout the growing season.Shorey, H. H.; Sisk, C. B.; Gerber, R. G. 1996 Environ. Entomol. 25, 446.Glenn, G. M.; Klamczynski, A. P.; Shey, J.; Chiou, B. S.; Holtmann, K. M.; Wood, D. F.; Ludvik, C.; DeGrandi-Hoffman, G.; Orts, W.; Imam, S. 2007 Polym. Adv. Technol. 18, 636.Yosha, I.; Shani, A.; Magdassi, S. 2006 J. Agric. Food Chem. 56, 8045. There are several draw-backs associated with current CRDs because they involve multi-step preparation protocols, exhibit low pheromone-holding capacities, are not biodegradable, and exhibit leaking of the pheromones when compressed or broken. To address these functional issues a sugar alcohol-based amphiphilic super-gelator, mannitol dioctanoate (M8), has been developed that efficiently gelled the pheromones, 2-heptanone and lauryl acetate. The miticide, 2-heptanone controls the parasitic mite, varroa (Varroa destructor), that are responsible for honey bee (Apis mellifera L) colony destruction.Sammataro, D.; Finley, J.; LeBlanc, B.; Wardell, G.; Ahumada-Segura, F.; Carroll, J. M. 2009 J. Agric. Res. 48, 256.Gashout, H. A.; Guzman-Novoa, E. 2009 J. Agric. Res. 48, 263. The researchers further developed the application of this supergelator by developing a reservoir-type CRD that consisted of the 2-heptanone gel in a vapor-barrier-film sealed pouch which was then activated by boring a small hole through the vapor barrier. The CRD had a high loading capacity of 92% wt/wt allowing for the construction of small devices with a high biocompatibility and because, M8 is composed of mannitol and fatty acids it is also biodegradable. =Drug delivery= Researchers have been exploring LMOGs belonging to a class of molecules called cyclohexane trisamides due to their ability to form hydrogels. By attaching functional groups to the gelator molecule, the researchers can adjust the gelation properties. The gels transition to the liquid state upon changes in temperature or pH K. J. C. van Bommel, et al., 2004 Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 43, 1663-1667 Taking it one step further, the researchers attached an amino acid and a model drug to the gel molecule and added an enzyme to the gel matrix. When the temperature or pH was changed, the gel molecules entered the liquid phase where the amino acid and drug molecule could be cleaved from the gel molecule by the enzyme. Researchers believe these LMOGs may some day be used as a fast, two-step release drug delivery system.K. J. C. van Bommel, M. C. A. Stuart, B. L. Feringa, J. van Esch., 2005 Org. Biomol. Chem., 3, 2917-2920 =Pollutant/heavy metal remediation= In 2010 researchers developed phase- selective gelators toward the containment and treatment of oil spills. They developed a class of LMOGs that were capable of gelling diesel, gasoline, pump, mineral, and silicone oils. These LMOGs were composed of dialkanoate derivatives of the sugar alcohols, mannitol and sorbitol. These sugar alcohol derivatives were ideal as they are biodegradable, inexpensive, and non-toxic. Once the oil was taken up by the gel fibers; it could then be separated from the gel by utilizing vacuum distillation and furthermore the gelator could be recycled.Jadhav, S. R.; Vemula, P. K.; Kumar, R.; Raghaven, S. R.; George, J. 2010 Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 49, 7695-7698. =Luminescent devices= Some gels can be used in luminescent devices such as OLED's and/or fluorescent sensors. One example of an OLED type LMOG is mono-substituted ethynyl-pyrene. This gelator forms a stable gel with DMF, toluene, or cyclohexane while maintaining its luminescence. Another important characteristic of these gels is that they maintain high charge carrier mobility. This means that the gel can pass sufficient current in an electronic luminescent device.Diring, S.; Camerel, F.; Donnio, B.; Dintzer, T.; Toffanin, S.; Capelli, R.; Muccini, M.; Ziessel, R. \\"Luminescent Ethynyl-Pyrene Liquid Crystals and Gels for Optoelectronic Devices\\", 2009, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 131, 18177-18185. Furthermore, luminescent gels can also be utilized as sensors. These sensors operate by forming a stable luminescent gel in the presence of different analytes. One example of a luminescent gel for sensing fluoride anions is presented by Prasad and Rajamalli. This example utilizes poly(aryl ether) dendrons attached to a core aryl ether with [anthracene] attached. Upon forming a stable yellow gel (under normal gelation conditions), if fluoride is introduced in the presence of the gel, the gel undergoes a gel to sol transition and becomes bright red. Being able to visually detect a color change in the presence of a dilute analyte is a promising field application of LMOG materials.Rajamalli, P.; Prasad, E. \\"Low Molecular Weight Fluorescent Organogel for Fluoride Ion Detection\\", 2011, Org. Lett., 13, 3714-3717. =Chemical sensing= Molecular gels can be sensitized toward an external stimuli aka light, heat, or chemicals. Also, LMOG's can be sensitized by the incorporation of a receptor unit or a spectroscopically active unit into the gelator molecule.Sangeetha, N. M.; Maitra, U. \\"Supramolecular Gels: Functions and Uses\\" 2005 Chem. Soc. Rev. 34, 821-836. A variety of quinoxalinones were recently developed that act as a mercury sensor by forming a gel when these ligands complex to mercury.King, K. N.; McNeil, A. Chem. Commun. 2010, 46, 3511‚Äì3513 A nonplanar dihydropyridine derivative was induced to gel upon oxidizing the molecule with nitric oxide and then dissolving the oxidized ligand in DMSO/water and then heating and cooling the mixture. This gel has the useful application as it can therefore act as a nitric oxide sensor.Chen, J.; McNeil, A. J. Am. Chem.

Context  For over 40 years, Colombia, a country well known for manufacturing and shipping illegal substances, has had issues with civil conflicts and rebel groups forming from within. Over the last decade progress has been made to make the country more secure, but paramilitary groups have recently returned. The country has become especially hazardous to human rights campaigners, labor leaders, journalists, and politicians. Many have been shot as an intimidation tactic. The demobilization of many of the paramilitary gangs that occurred in 2006 actually created another issue as these gangs evolved into bacrims, or criminal gangs. These gangs have been stealing land from peasants through force, drug trafficking, and kidnapping among other offenses. The continual cycle of violence and hostility from within Colombia has caused many citizens to fear for their own safety as a result of the lack of adequate police and judicial forces. G√≥mez was a witness in a paramilitary case that would link politicians and illegal extremist paramilitary groups together. The case that he witnessed was commonly known as the \\"parapolitics\\" scandal.  Reactions  Irina Bokova, who is the director-general of UNESCO, said: \\"I condemn the murder of Luis Eduardo G√≥mez.

Introduction  Spin is the fundamental property that distinguishes the two types of elementary particles: fermions with half-integer spins and bosons with integer spins. Photons, which are the quanta of light, have been long recognized as spin-1 gauge bosons. The polarization of the light is commonly accepted as its ‚Äúintrinsic‚Äù spin degree of freedom. However, in free space, only two transverse polarizations are allowed. Thus, the photon spin is always only connected to the two circular polarizations. To construct the full quantum spin operator of light, longitudinal polarized photon modes have to be introduced. Left and right circular polarization and their associate angular momenta An electromagnetic wave is said to have circular polarization when its electric and magnetic fields rotate continuously around the beam axis during propagation. The circular polarization is left (L) or right (R) depending on the field rotation direction and, according to the convention used: either from the point of view of the source, or the receiver. Both conventions are used in science depending on the context. When a light beam is circularly polarized, each of its photons carries a spin angular momentum (SAM) of \\\\pm\\\\hbar, where \\\\hbar is the reduced Planck constant and the \\\\pm sign is positive for left and negative for right circular polarizations (this is adopting the convention from the point of view of the receiver most commonly used in optics). This SAM is directed along the beam axis (parallel if positive, antiparallel if negative). The above figure shows the instantaneous structure of the electric field of left (L) and right (R) circularly polarized light in space. The green arrows indicate the propagation direction. The mathematical expressions reported under the figures give the three electric-field components of a circularly polarized plane wave propagating in the z direction, in complex notation.  Mathematical expression  General expression for the spin angular momentum is \\\\mathbf{S} = \\\\frac{1}{c}\\\\int d^{3}x\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi}\\\\times\\\\boldsymbol{A}, where c is the speed of light in free space and \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\pi} is the conjugate canonical momentum of the vector potential \\\\mathbf{A}. The general expression for the orbital angular momentum of light is \\\\mathbf{L} = \\\\frac{1}{c}\\\\int d^{3}x\\\\pi^{\\\\mu}\\\\boldsymbol{x}\\\\times\\\\boldsymbol{ abla}A_{\\\\mu}, where \\\\mu=\\\\\\\\{0,1,2,3\\\\\\\\} denotes four indices of the spacetime and Einstein's summation convention has been applied. To quantize light, the basic equal-time commutation relations have to be postulated, [A^{\\\\mu}(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t),\\\\pi^{\\\\mu}(\\\\boldsymbol{x}',t)] =i\\\\hbar cg^{\\\\mu u}\\\\delta^{3}(\\\\boldsymbol{x}-\\\\boldsymbol{x}'), [A^{\\\\mu}(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t),A^{ u}(\\\\boldsymbol{x}',t)] =[\\\\pi^{\\\\mu}(\\\\boldsymbol{x},t),\\\\pi^{\\\\mu}(\\\\boldsymbol{x}',t)]=0, where \\\\hbar is the reduced Plank constant and g^{\\\\mu u}=\\\\rm{diag}\\\\\\\\{1,-1,-1,-1\\\\\\\\} is the metric tensor of the Minkowski space. Then, one can verify that both \\\\boldsymbol{S} and \\\\boldsymbol{L} satisfy the canonical angular momentum commutation relations [S_{i},S_{j}] =i\\\\hbar\\\\epsilon_{ijk}S_{k}, [L_{i},L_{j}] =i\\\\hbar\\\\epsilon_{ijk}L_{k}, and they commute with each other [S_{i},L_{j}] =0. After the plane-wave expansion, the photon spin can be re-expressed in a simple and intuitive form in the wave-vector space \\\\boldsymbol{S}=\\\\hbar\\\\int d^{3}k \\\\hat{\\\\phi}^{\\\\dagger}_{\\\\boldsymbol{k}}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat{s}}\\\\hat{\\\\phi}_{\\\\boldsymbol{k}} where the column-vector \\\\hat{\\\\phi}_{\\\\boldsymbol{k}}=[\\\\hat{a}_{\\\\boldsymbol{k},1},\\\\hat{a}_{\\\\boldsymbol{k},2},\\\\hat{a}_{\\\\boldsymbol{k},3}]^{T} is the field operator of the photon in wave-vector space and the 3\\\\times 3 matrix \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat{s}}=\\\\sum_{\\\\lambda=1}^3\\\\hat{s}_{\\\\lambda}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon}(\\\\boldsymbol{k},\\\\lambda) is the spin-1 operator of the photon with the SO(3) rotation generators \\\\hat{s}_{1}= \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & -i\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & i & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}, \\\\hat{s}_{2}=\\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & i\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ -i & 0 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}, \\\\hat{s}_{3}=\\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ i & 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}, and the two unit vectors \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon}(\\\\boldsymbol{k},1)\\\\cdot\\\\boldsymbol{k}=\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon}(\\\\boldsymbol{k},2)\\\\cdot\\\\boldsymbol{k}=0 denote the two transverse polarizations of light in free space and unit vector\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon}(\\\\boldsymbol{k},3)=\\\\boldsymbol{k}/\\\\boldsymbol{k} denotes the longitudinal polarization. Due to the longitudinal polarized photon and scalar photon have been involved, both \\\\boldsymbol{S} and \\\\boldsymbol{L} are not gauge invariant. To to incorporate the gauge invariance into the photon angular momenta, a re-decomposition of the total QED angular momentum and the Lorenz gauge condition have to be enforced. Finally, the direct observable part of spin and orbital angular momenta of light are given by \\\\boldsymbol{S}^{\\\\rm obs}=i\\\\hbar\\\\int d^3 k(\\\\hat{a}_{\\\\boldsymbol{k},2}^{\\\\dagger}\\\\hat{a}_{\\\\boldsymbol{k},1}-\\\\hat{a}_{\\\\boldsymbol{k},1}^{\\\\dagger}\\\\hat{a}_{\\\\boldsymbol{k},2})\\\\frac{\\\\boldsymbol{k}}{\\\\boldsymbol{k}}=\\\\varepsilon_{0} \\\\int d^{3}x\\\\boldsymbol{E}_{\\\\perp}\\\\times \\\\boldsymbol{A}_{\\\\perp}, and \\\\boldsymbol{L}^{\\\\rm obs}_{M}=\\\\varepsilon_{0}\\\\int d^{3}x E_{\\\\perp}^{j}\\\\boldsymbol{x}\\\\times\\\\boldsymbol{ abla}A_{\\\\perp}^{j} which recover the angular momenta of classical transverse light. Here, \\\\boldsymbol{E}_{\\\\perp}(\\\\boldsymbol{A}_{\\\\perp}) is the transverse part of the electric field (vector potential), \\\\varepsilon_0 is the vacuum permittivity, and we are using SI units. We can define the annihilation operators for circularly polarized transverse photons: \\\\hat{a}_{\\\\boldsymbol{k},L} =\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\left(\\\\hat{a}_{\\\\boldsymbol{k},1}-i\\\\hat{a}_{\\\\boldsymbol{k},2}\\\\right), \\\\hat{a}_{\\\\boldsymbol{k},R} =\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\left(\\\\hat{a}_{\\\\boldsymbol{k},1}+i\\\\hat{a}_{\\\\boldsymbol{k},2}\\\\right), with polarization unit vectors \\\\boldsymbol{e}(\\\\boldsymbol{k},L) =\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\left[\\\\boldsymbol{e}(\\\\boldsymbol{k},1)+i\\\\boldsymbol{e}(\\\\boldsymbol{k},2)\\\\right], \\\\boldsymbol{e}(\\\\boldsymbol{k},R) =\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\left[\\\\boldsymbol{e}(\\\\boldsymbol{k},1)-i\\\\boldsymbol{e}(\\\\boldsymbol{k},2)\\\\right]. Then, the transverse-field photon spin can be re-expressed as :\\\\mathbf{S}^{\\\\rm obs} = \\\\int d^3k\\\\hbar \\\\left(\\\\hat{a}^\\\\dagger_{\\\\mathbf{k},L} \\\\hat{a}_{\\\\mathbf{k},L} - \\\\hat{a}^\\\\dagger_{\\\\mathbf{k},R} \\\\hat{a}_{\\\\mathbf{k},R}\\\\right)\\\\frac{\\\\boldsymbol{k}}{\\\\boldsymbol{k}}, For a single plane-wave photon, the spin can only have two values \\\\pm\\\\hbar, which are eigenvalues of the spin operator \\\\hat{s}_3. The corresponding eigenfunctions describing photons with well defined values of SAM are described as circularly polarized waves: :\\\\pm\\\\rangle = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\pm i \\\\\\\\\\\\0\\\\end{pmatrix}. : See also * Helmholtz equation * Orbital angular momentum of light * Photon polarization * Spin polarization  References  Further reading  Category:Light Category:Physical quantities ","title":"Spin angular momentum of light"},{"id":"33179444","title":"1997 World Weightlifting Championships ‚Äì Men's 70 kg"},{"id":"33179453","text":"was a Japanese swordsman who also served as a martial arts instructor of Tatsumi-ry≈´ and Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department.

Following the election of Jos√© Miguel G√≥mez in November 1908, U.S. officials judged the situation in Cuba sufficiently stable for the U.S. to withdraw its troops, a process that was completed in February 1909.Beede, pg. 28-30http://www.dtic.mil/cgi- bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&doc;=GetTRDoc.pdf&AD;=ADA506295 An earlier occupation lasted from 1898‚Äì1902, from the conclusion of peace between the United States and Spain at the end of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War until the inauguration of the Republic of Cuba. Background The role of the United States in Cuban affairs, its responsibilities and prerogatives, derived from the Cuban‚ÄìAmerican Treaty of Relations of 1903, which Cuba and the United States had signed on 22 May 1903, and ratified in 1904. Article III stated: It contained this provision: The conflict between Cuba's political parties began during the presidential election of September 1905, in which Estrada Palma and his party rigged the election to ensure victory over the liberal candidate, Jos√© Miguel G√≥mez. The liberals orchestrated a revolt in August 1906. Both sides sought United States military intervention, the government expecting support in suppressing the rebellion and its opponents hoping for new, supervised elections. When Estrada Palma asked for U.S. troops, President Roosevelt was initially reluctant. He sent the Secretary of War William H. Taft and Assistant Secretary of State Robert Bacon to hold discussions in search of a negotiated resolution of the parties' differences. Arriving on 19 September, Taft and Bacon met with the leaders of both parties. When Estrada Palma recognized that Roosevelt was not prepared to support his position, he resigned on 28 September 1906.Minger, Ralph Eldin. \\"William H. Taft and the United States Intervention in Cuba in 1906.\\" The Hispanic American Historical Review. Vol. 41, No. 1 (Feb. 1961) , pp. 75‚Äì89. Duke University Press. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2509992 Occupation The day following his resignation, Secretary Taft invoked the terms of the 1903 treaty, established the Provisional Government of Cuba and named himself Provisional Governor of Cuba.Records of the Provisional Government of Cuba, National Archives and Records Administration On 23 October 1906, President Roosevelt issued , ratifying Taft's actions. U.S. officials ordered the United States Navy to land a brigade of marines. Under the command of Colonel Littleton Waller, they were to protect American citizens and patrol the island until the regular army arrived. The rebels offered no resistance and viewed the American intervention as a sign of success. The U.S. Army General Frederick Funston supervised the surrender of the rebels even before the army arrived. Funston resigned soon after though and was replaced by General James Franklin Bell.United States War Department, pg. 313 On 6 October, the first army soldiers landed from the transport Sumner. The force was originally called the Army of Cuban Intervention but Taft renamed it on 15 October the Army of Cuban Pacification.Musicant, I, The Banana Wars, 1990, New York: MacMillan Publishing Co., , page 63 The U.S. Congress and Roosevelt authorized the deployment of 18,000 men to Cuba for the expedition but the number in Cuba never exceeded 425 officers and 6,196 enlisted men. About half of the troops were from the 11th Cavalry Regiment under Colonel Earl Thomas and half from the 2nd Regiment, 1st Expeditionary Brigade. In one historian's account, the \\"Army of Cuban Pacification served as a strong moral presence on the island to encourage stability and obedience to the provisional government.\\"Beebe Many of the officers were veterans of the Filipino War and exercised strict discipline to prevent serious incidents of misconduct. Since the rebels had already laid down their arms, the Americans focused on building roads and outposts. A total of 92 kilometers of new roads were constructed during the occupation and the army manned about thirty different posts in both the rural and urban areas, including Guantanamo Bay. Headquarters was at Camp Columbia, west of Havana.Musicant, I, The Banana Wars, 1990, New York: MacMillan Publishing Co., , page 67 The military administration worried about their troops contracting typhoid, malaria and gonorrhea, and ten percent of the soldiers contracted a venereal disease during the occupation. Most of the troops were stationed in Santa Clara Province, near the population centers and strategically deployed along railways, roads, and other shipping lanes used to transport sugar cane, the principal American-owned business ventures in Cuba. In anticipation of future political unrest and rebellion, the Americans organized a Military Intelligence Division (MID) to gather information about Cuban military capacity and resources available to government opponents.http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/cuba06.htm The MID prepared a list of names of all those who had participated in the revolt of 1906 and printed accurate maps of the Cuban topography. They also took detailed photographs for every strategic railroad bridge and waterway. Other troops reorganized and trained the Cuban Rural Guard (Guardia Rural Cubana), with an emphasis on improving discipline and morale and ending promotions based on politics. This effort had little impact, because the Cuban government decided to emphasize a reorganized and permanent Cuban army in place of the Rural Guard. Creating a stronger and permanent military force was controversial because it could serve the political interests of the party in power, but its proponents argued that only a permanent fighting force could ensure longterm stability. On 13 October 1906, Charles Edward Magoon assumed the position of Cuba's provisional governor and he decided that the country was stable enough to hold elections. Regional elections took place on 25 May 1908, and the presidential election on 14 November, both supervised by the U.S. military. The elections took place without incident and Jos√© Miguel G√≥mez was elected. He took office on 28 January 1909. The U.S. troops were withdrawn over the following weeks, with the last American forces leaving the island country on 6 February 1909.Otero, pg. 157http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/15033966 Assessing the operation, President Roosevelt praised its efficiency (\\"the swiftest mobilization and dispatch of troops over sea ever accomplished by our Government\\") and said it confirmed his support for organizing U.S. forces under the General Staff in the Army and the General Board in the Navy.United States War Department, pg. 315 =Baseball= During the occupation, the Afro-Cuban pitcher Jos√© de la Caridad M√©ndez faced the visiting Cincinnati Reds in December 1908. In a three-game exhibition series, he pitched 25 consecutive scoreless innings, including a five-hit shutout in the last game.

The farce was published by Johan Dahl's publishing house, and Dahl himself is immortalized through Wergeland's farce, where his course of life forms the basis for a wild parody. Synopsis Johan, a spoiled Danish brat, is punished on midsummer eve by his uncle, the \\"sensible\\" Tobias G√ºldenthal (proprietor of the Gyldendal bookstore in Copenhagen). Johan has been naughty, spanking his mother, being rude to people around him, and during his grounding in the garden, he effectively maims and kills a butterfly, a scarab beetle, and ribs the parrot resting nearby. After molesting a bed of flowers, the scent of the flowers drowse him, and he falls asleep. At this point the elves intervene, punishing Johan even more. As they protect nature and all living things, they decide to \\"borrow\\" Johan's soul, and put it into the dying parrot. From now on, he will live his life inside the parrot, as the \\"human condition\\" is too big for him. The elves wow to come for him if he doesn't better himself. Hence, Johan the parrot is afraid of elves. After a period of lodging at the house of the poet Promethevs (a parody of the elderly Adam Oehlenschl√§ger), the uncles Tobias and Zacharias decide to send the parrot forth to Norway, to be a book-keeper there, and run the Christiania branch of the Gyldendal bookstore. He is instructed to use covert means of cultural imperialism to subdue \\"patriotism\\" in any form. When landing at the quay of Christiania, he is befriended by the poet Polemikkel Poetikkel and his \\"vehicles\\", danophiliacs to the extreme. They set up headquarters in Johan's bookstore. Johan, however, writes home to his uncles in \\"parrot-style\\", relating his success, and gets bolder. He is \\"not afraid of elves anymore\\". He relates also that the Poeticle gang has a sworn enemy, one \\"Siful\\", apparently a vulgar fellow he despises. In the bookstore, the gang makes a point of slander all of Siful's poetry (even reciting some of Wergeland's own \\"high\\" poems). At one occasion, Johan is bold enough to enter the botanical gardens at T√∏yen, where Siful, allied with the elves, unmask him, and Johan's cover is blown. He sells himself to a troupe of Italian jugglers and returns to Copenhagen. Poetikkel follows Johan to Denmark, entering the abode of the \\"sensible\\" uncle Tobias, to present his lengthy poem on Norwegian topics to him. The poet is thrown out on his ear, with the words \\"so this is the man who has slandered his mother country, and dares boast of it to the sensible Dane?\\" At this point, Danish elves return and moves Johan's soul from the parrot over in a new shell, a scarab beetle. Johan finally understands when the rejected Poetikkel ribs him of his legs. Dying, Johan speaks to the poet and begs him to \\"recognize his errors\\". To no avail. Poetikkel hangs himself and drops down... ...As the boy Johan wakes from his dream by a falling and rotten pear on his nose. He states that he from now on will be kind to his mother, and \\"never, ever forget the parrot\\". Themes The biographical themes should be clear: the feud between Wergeland and his contemporary Welhaven. Johan the parrot is in many respects the bookbinder Johan Dahl, himself Danish, who in the end agreed to edit and print this play. Wergeland wrote in spite \\"the editor is really Johan Dahl\\" on the title page. In the play, he goes by the name \\"Johan Papendahl\\". Contemporary audiences were well aware of the joke. In revenge, Dahl made the first edition as ugly as possible. The underlying theme is cultural imperialism, mostly on behalf of the Danish-Norwegian cultural conflict. A singing fisherman in the opening parts laments the cruel waves, who without mercy bring \\"Danes at peace and Britons at war\\" to the Norwegian shores (relating to the Napoleonic wars and their effect on Norway). Another theme is the fight between reality and pretence, nature and urbanism, notably in the \\"elvish\\" parts, where the \\"real\\" poet Siful is on the side of nature and allied with the elves, whereas the urban romantics hardly leave the town at all. The play is presented as a farce, but is also related to old morality plays, in a combination who is special for Wergeland: the morality farce.

He was discoverer of the prehistoric site at the Rock of Solutr√©. Family Testot-Ferry was the youngest son of Baron Claude Testot- Ferry and his wife Jos√©phine Elizabeth Claudine Fabry. Henry's father was a hero of the Napoleonic Wars who had been ennobled by Emperor Napoleon I and died at Ch√¢tillon-sur-Seine. After a somewhite idle youth typical of the \\"gilded youth\\" of the 19th century, in which hunting was his chief passion, he married in 1852, at the advice (or perhaps the insistence) of his older brother Gustave. His wife was Louise Madeleine O'Brien, descendant of the O'Brien clan of Munster, which had given rise to several Kings of Ireland, and which had been received to courtly honours under Louis XV of France in 1737. O'Brien brought as dowry her property at Priss√©, Sa√¥ne-et-Loire which they occupied until moving to settle down in the village of Bussi√®res, situated a few kilometres from the Rock of Solutr√©. Testot-Ferry became mayor of Bussi√®res in 1856. Testot-Ferry would have six children, whose lives would have nothing to do with paleontology. His son Alfred, born in 1853, became a ship lieutenant at Toulon, and was elevated to Chevalier de la l√©gion d'honneur. Early career Testot-Ferry initially devoted himself to geology. A founding member of the Comit√© de pal√©ontologie fran√ßaise, he was put in charge of monograph on fossilized cnidaria polyps in collaboration with Dr. Louis √âdouard Gourdan de Fromentel. During this time he discovered and described a new genre which took his name: \\"Ferrya\\". Testot-Ferry was the first to note traces of different prehistoric occupations in Sa√¥ne river valley, which he found while searching the region in its entirety and particularly the Charbonni√®res-les-Sapins site. The Rock of Solutr√© With paleontology overtaking geology as his main interest, Testot-Ferry started to probe the Crot-du-Charnier site at the foot of the Rock of Solutr√© in 1866, which had outcrops of horse bones (called \\"magma\\"). Shortly afterwards, Testot-Ferry discovered, along the road crossing Crot-du-Charnier, a zone of homes from the \\"Reindeer Age\\" (the Upper Paleolithic era of prehistory) containing numerous flint tools and the remains of fauna. Although reindeer predominated, horse, elephant, red deer, fox, wolf and even cave tiger were also found. In some homes he found more than 2,000 flints and almost 400 reindeer antlers. In contrast to cave sites which had been discovered, in Solutr√© it was difficult to determine the size of the deposits and their boundary. Testot-Ferry proceeded to survey the area along with Adrien Arcelin. The two men decided to sift the earth with their hands, so that the remains would be methodically collected and examined. In 1868, Testot-Ferry concluded that a hunting station had existed at the foot of the rock: In 1867 Testot- Ferry had also discovered a small statuette of a deer. This was first known specimen of Solutrean art, and attested to the culture of prehistoric man in the same way as cave paintings. A life devoted to the sciences In the course of his studies on the prehistoric deposits at the Rock of Solutr√©, Testot-Ferry came into contact with most of the prehistorians of his day to discuss and check a certain number of hypotheses. He also maintained a long correspondence with Jacques Boucher de Perthes. √âdouard Lartet, Gabriel de Mortillet and Sir John Lubbock would even come to the site to help him with excavations. Testot-Ferry and Arcelin presented their research in international conferences, and Solutr√© very quickly became one of the most important prehistoric sites in France. Death certificate of Henry Testot-Ferry Testot-Ferry contributed to the scientific life of numerous institutions in France, and was: * A founding member of the Comit√© de Pal√©ontologie Fran√ßaise with whom he participated in writing the final 16 volumes of Pal√©ontologie fran√ßaise which had been started by Alcide Dessalines d'Orbigny. * Member of the Soci√©t√© G√©ologique de France * Correspondent of the Linnean Society of Normandie * Correspondent of the Soci√©t√© d'√âmulation du Doubs * Titulary of the Acad√©mie de M√¢con A significant part of Testot-Ferry's reference collection of 5262 objects was bequeathed to the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle in Paris, as well as to the ainsi Mus√©e des Ursulines in M√¢con. His grandson, Andr√© Testot-Ferry would sell another significant part of the collection to the British Museum of London in 1958. Anecdotes *At the 1872 Brussels congress, a few years after Testot-Ferry's death, the famous anthropologist Gabriel de Morillet decided to name prehistoric cultures by the sites where they had been observed. Accordingly, he gave the name \\"Solutrean\\" to the culture discovered by Testot-Ferry near the Rock of Solutr√©. *A road in Bussi√®res, was in 2004 inaugurated Rue Henry Testot-Ferry; it runs by the house where he lived in the direction of the rock.

It was the first feature film to be created in Poland following the six years of World War II. The film, set during the German occupation of Warsaw during the war, tells the story of several inhabitants of the same tenement house. Their stories are loosely tied together by a set of songs, both pre-war ballads popular during the war and war-time popular songs mocking German occupation (Siekiera, motyka). The film's premiere took place on 8 January 1947 in the newly reopened Palladium cinema in Warsaw. The film proved to be highly popular and more than 10.8 million people watched it in the following three years - twice the usual average attendance in post-war Poland. In 1948 the film was re-edited and re-released in a new version, with more focus on Red Army's role as the liberator of Poland and the main ally of post-war Polish communist regime, as well as more grim outlook of the German occupation of Warsaw and German brutality in general.

A former soldier of Polish Armed Forces in the West often blunders when Tokarski tells about German occupation. * boy singing song against Germans in tram‚Äîsong ends with words ≈öpiewaƒá siƒô nie bojƒô, bo mnie nie zrozumiƒÖ te przeklƒôte gnoje.

Boy tries to escape, but he is shot by German soldiers. * German policeman at Tokarskis' home: ** 1947 edition‚Äîpoliceman begins to play piano, ** 1948 edition‚Äîpoliceman tries to force Tokarski's mother to play Deutschlandlied, beats and pushes her. * soldiers of Polish resistance at home of Volksdeutsche Maria Kƒôdziorek (Marie Kentschorek): ** 1947 edition‚Äîthey shot her, ** 1948 edition‚Äîmovie suggests that they have shaved her head. * a scene in which a blind accordionist is killed by Polish policeman, was added in 1948 edition. However, as the farcical plot and all-familiar songs were mostly free of ideological subtexts, the film remained popular in the decades to come and some of its songs re-emerged in slightly modified form during the 1980s martial law and struggle against the Communist rule. The film remains well- known and popular even in modern Poland, being screened by the public Polish Television (TVP) on a regular basis. Both editions have been published on DVD in Poland, by the Propaganda label, first the 1947 one, as-is, and later the 1948 one, in a digitally restored version.

History Millbrook adjoins or is near to other districts of the Moorabool Shire such as Ballan, Egerton, Gordon, Wallace and Bungaree and its early history is inseparable from theirs.

Before the war seven other Australians had held the title. Paddon was a professional sculler but unlike many of the earlier Champions he did not need to rely on sculling income to maintain his life-style. He was a successful Evans Head businessman who had interests in oyster leases, fishing, sub-leasing, farming, and tourism. Australian Champion Harry Pearce had been the Australian Champion since 1909 and had challenged Ernest Barry for the world title. Not long before Pearce‚Äôs departure for England, Alf Felton, Charles Towns, and Jim Paddon all challenged Pearce for his Australian Championship. The lateness of the challenges was intended to force Pearce to forfeit his domestic title so that the challengers could decide among themselves who should be the new champion. Rather than jeopardise his World Title chances Pearce forfeited his title which was then claimed by Felton. Felton and Towns raced in January 1913 and Felton won the race by four lengths. In a subsequent race held in February 1913 Paddon handsomely beat Felton by two minutes and thus became the Australian Champion; a title he held until 1926. See Also Australian Sculling Championship.  World Title Attempt On the strength of his win Paddon challenged Ernest Barry for the World Title. Barry was interested in travelling to Australia for a match but stated that the British public would expect any title match involving an English champion to be raced on home waters. Paddon therefore went to England and the match was held on the Thames on the Championship Course on 7 September 1914. Paddon was nicknamed \\"Big Jim\\" as he was unusually tall for the times being 6 feet 4 inches tall. At the start Barry was faster away and soon had a three-quarters length lead but Paddon, by spurting, had a small lead at the mile post. At this point the time was 4m.59s. Barry with a better stroke overhauled Paddon and by Hammersmith Bridge was more than a length in front. However Barry ‚Äòcaught a crab‚Äô under the bridge and Paddon took advantage of this and again spurted. There was a risk of a foul and later Paddon stated that the boats did actually touch but as he did not want to win in that manner he did not make any appeal to the umpire. Barry did not believe the boats touched. Barry quickly recovered and extended his lead to nearly three lengths at Chiswick Church, by four lengths at Barnes Bridge, eased off and finally came home by two and a half lengths in a time of 21m.28s. Paddon said that he was satisfied with his rowing but that the water had bothered him. No World Title matches were held during World War I. In 1919 Barry raced and lost to Alf Felton on the Thames. In a return match in Sydney in 1920 the result was reversed. Barry was then challenged by Richard Arnst but he failed to accept as he had retired so Arnst became the holder by forfeiture, and after one defence against Pat Hannan lost the title to fellow New Zealander Darcy Hadfield in 1922. World Champion Paddon still felt he was up to taking the World Title so he challenged Hadfield. This time the race was to be held on the Whanganui River, New Zealand, at Easter time (18 April 1922.) A large crowd turned up to watch the race including leading parliamentarians. After the start Hadfield forged ahead but this spurred Paddon to greater efforts. Shortly afterwards Hadfield showed signs of arm weakness so that by the mile post Paddon was three lengths clear. From there on, no matter what Hadfield tried, the result was never in doubt as Paddon‚Äôs superior strength and position on the river won the day. By the three mile post he was six lengths clear and gained another by the finish shortly afterwards. Paddon thus became World Champion. The time was a fast 19m.19s.  The Return Match Paddon and Hadfield had a return match on 21 July 1923. The stake was ¬£500 a side. Unusually this match was held on the Richmond River, North Coast district, NSW, Australia. Usually such races were held on the Parramatta River in Sydney but Paddon was disinclined to race there. Hadfield had done much more training than for the previous race and observers believed a much closer race would be expected. Unfortunately this was not to be the case and Paddon easily won by a dozen lengths or so in a time of 19m.46s. The Felton Challenge Alf Felton had his third World Title match when he challenged Jim Paddon. Felton had persuaded a group of Brisbane promoters to stage a world championship match as part of the Brisbane Centennial celebrations. The match was unusual in that it was held on the Brisbane River ‚Äì the first such match on the river. The date was 12 August 1924 and the course was slightly shorter than normal at about three miles. Felton further caused controversy when he refused to row with Bill Beach as umpire. Paddon as Champion had the right to nominate most of the terms, but in order to secure the match agreed to Felton‚Äôs demands and another umpire was found. A very large crowd was on hand to witness the race but it was not much of a race. Felton had the reputation of a fast sprinter but he showed none of his old form when Paddon took the lead after only one hundred yards and the result was never in doubt. Paddon easily defeated Felton in a time of 17m.55s. The Goodsell Challenge Major Goodsell had his first attempt at winning the Single Sculls World Championship on 20 September 1924. Goodsell was an up-an- coming sculler and had won the New South Wales amateur championship before turning professional. He challenged Paddon, for a match with a stake of ¬£200 a side. The race was held on the Richmond River, North Coast district, NSW, Australia. Goodsell was known to be fast over the first mile or two and a good race was expected. He was trying to break the Champion by a fast pace but evidently tried too hard as he capsized after just a quarter of a mile. Although he got back into the boat and continued, the race was effectively over and the Champion just paddled home to win. Retirement Jim Paddon was next challenged by another Australian, William (Bill) McDevitt, but Paddon had decided to retire and declined to race, so McDevitt became the Holder by forfeiture. Paddon stated that in declining to race it was on the condition that Goodsell would get the right of first challenge. Goodsell therefore challenged McDevitt and the race was run on the Clarance River near Ullmarra on 21 March 1925. The stake was ¬£250 a side. Goodsell won easily by fifteen lengths although the time was a slow 22m.20s. McDevitt was one of two Title Holders who had gained the honour by forfeiture and who failed to defend it on their first challenge. The other was Charles Towns. Final Championship Race Goodsell held off a challenge by Pat Hannan in 1925. Paddon decided to come out of retirement and challenged Goodsell and this race was held on 7 November 1925 on the famous Parramatta course in Sydney. By this time Paddon was aged nearly thirty-nine years and was nearing the end of his career. He failed to make any sort of \\"come-back\\" and the Champion won easily in a time of 22m.50s. Overview Paddon was the Australian Champion for about thirteen years 1913-26; an unusually long time. Paddon also raced in six World Championship races and very easily won four of them. His active years in this event spanned from 1914 to 1925 which was a far longer time than many other champions. Jim Paddon was the father of Evans Paddon who was a much later Single Sculls World Champion. Evans was involved in nine such races and won three of them in the period 1938 ‚Äì 57.

He is best known for his close friendship with the composer Franz Schubert. Biography Mayrhofer was born in Steyr, educated at Novitiate in St. Florian's Priory Upper Austria. In 1810 he began to study Jurisprudence and Theology at the University of Vienna, both of which courses he finished. In 1814 he met the young composer Franz Schubert and his friends (Joseph von Spaun, Franz von Schober). Mayrhofer wrote a lot of lyric poetry and published it in 1824. Forty-seven Schubert songs and two of his operas are based on Mayrhofer‚Äôs lyric poems. As a young man Mayrhofer had been hopelessly in love with Mina (Wilhelmina Watteroth), the daughter of Heinrich Watteroth, who was one of Mayrhofer's professors and for a short time also his landlord. In his late years Mayrhofer (like Schubert) fell in love with a young 15-year-old girl, the daughter of his landlord Doctor Strauss. Mayrhofer was a hypochondriac all his life: in 1836, during a cholera epidemic, he committed suicide by jumping from the window of his office in Vienna.Susan Youens, Schubert's Poets and the making of Lieder, p. 152 Libretti * Die Freunde von Salamanca (1815) * Adrast (1819) References * List, Fritz (1921), Johann Mayrhofer, ein Freund und Textdichter Franz Schuberts.

Background Al-Ahmadi was shot dead shortly before the Journalistic Freedoms Observatory's office was ransacked on 24 February by Iraqi soldiers and before the \\"Day of Rage\\" protests in Iraq. The nationwide protests in Iraq on 25 February were inspired by the Arab Spring uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt. Protests also took place in major Iraqi cities Mosul, where Al-Ahmadi was attacked. The protests centered on corruption and lack of services that Al-Ahmadi had written about.al-Jazeera. \\"Tensions flare in Iraq rallies.\\" Feb 25,2011.

Reporters Without Borders called this time ‚Äúone of the blackest days for media freedom‚Äù in Iraq. Death Hilal Al-Ahmadi, 57, was leaving his home for work 17 February 2011, when a car drove up to him. The car carried two men with automatic weapons who then shot the journalist. Al- Ahmadi was shot multiple times and was found dead in his suburb of Mithaq, located in Eastern Mosul, Iraq. Al-Ahmadi's body was taken to Mosul's department of forensic medicine. As with all the other cases of killed journalists in Iraq since 2003, the perpetrators have not been brought to justice. International Reaction to Al-Ahmadi's Death The overall reaction to Hilal Al-Ahmadi's death by organizations who defend the rights of journalists worldwide was frustration over Iraq's high impunity for such attacks. The Committee to Protect Journalists said in a CNN report and in reaction to Al-Ahmadi's death, \\"Not a single journalist murder since 2003 has been seriously investigated by authorities, and not a single perpetrator has been brought to justice.\\" According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Iraq was ranked #1 on the 2010 Impunity Index.

The fourth Category 4 and major hurricane, seventh hurricane, and eighth tropical storm of the 2011 Pacific hurricane season, Hilary developed from an area of low pressure off the Pacific coast of Central America in mid-September. Organizing quickly, the system became a tropical depression on September 21, after gaining enough organization to be declared as such. While moving towards the west-northwest, the depression continued to gather strength and was subsequently upgraded to a tropical storm just several hours later. On September 21, Hilary was declared as a Category 1 hurricane, while located close to the Mexican coastline, where the storm brought heavy rainfall and flooding. Undergoing rapid intensification, Hilary strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane on September 22, recognized with a distinct eye feature. Beginning to enter cooler Ocean temperatures, Hilary began to weaken by September 25 but briefly restrengthened into a Category 4 the following day. Atmospheric conditions became increasingly unfavorable late on September 26, and the system began to weaken. During the afternoon hours of September 30, Hilary became a remnant low, while located several hundred miles away from any landmasses. Meteorological history On September 7, a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa. During the nighttime hours of September 18, an area of showers and thunderstorms associated with a broad area of low pressure was observed a couple of hundred miles south-southeast of the Gulf of Tehuantepec as it moved westward. The following day, the area of disturbed weather began to become better organized, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded its chances of tropical cyclone development to the \\"Medium\\" category. Moving towards the west-northwest, the area of disturbed weather was upgraded into a tropical depression during the morning hours of September 21, after radar data showed that the low pressure area had gained enough structure to be declared as such. Due to a favorable upper regime characterized by low wind shear and a moist environment, the National Hurricane Center predicted intensification into a hurricane within two days. Later on September 21, despite the fact that rainbands on the western semicircle of the depression became less defined, the depression acquired gale-force winds, and was subsequently upgraded into a tropical storm, earning the name Hilary. That afternoon, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch for parts of the Mexican coastline, indicating that rainfall totals of 3‚Äì5 inches, with isolated 10 inch amounts, were possible. On September 22, while quickly strengthening, Hilary was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale. It was noted by the National Hurricane Center that strengthening into a major hurricane, defined by a hurricane with winds that exceed , was likely over the coming days. Just several hours later, Hilary was recorded as a rapidly strengthening Category 2 hurricane located nearby the Mexican coastline. At 00:00 UTC September 23, Hilary was upgraded into a major hurricane, the fourth of the season. Continuing to rapidly strengthen, Hilary became a Category 4 hurricane just a few hours later after becoming a Category 3, and reached a peak intensity of 145 mph (235 km/h) at 0600 UTC September 23 (11 p.m. AST September 22). However, the storm began to enter an area of higher wind shear and cooler ocean temperatures on September 24, and Hilary began to weaken. The hurricane weakened back down to a Category 3 hurricane early on September 25, but was later upgraded briefly to a Category 4 again the following afternoon. Hurricane Hilary at its secondary peak strength on September 26 Several hours later, the storm was once again downgraded into a Category 3 hurricane, and during the afternoon hours of September 27, Hilary was further downgraded into a Category 2 hurricane. Early on the following morning, Hilary weakened into a Category 1 hurricane, before weakening further into a tropical storm on September 28. Losing a lot of its convection on September 30, the National Hurricane Center noted that Hilary had weakened into a tropical depression. Several hours later, after sustaining no deep convection atop its center, Hilary was declared a remnant low, located several hundred miles away from any landmasses. Over the next 3 days, Hilary's remnant low subsequently moved towards the southwest, before dissipating after 1200 UTC on October 3, about to the west of the southern tip of Baja California. Preparations and impact The NHC noted the possibility of up to of rain in the high-terrain of Guerrero and Oaxaca, and large swells were expected to impact coastal areas. Tropical cyclone watches and warnings were therefore issued for portions of the Pacific coast of Mexico. A red emergency alert was additionally in place for the region; officials urged residents to be prepared to evacuate, and tourists were advised to stay indoors. Due to rough surf, small craft advisories were put in effect, and swimmers were advised to take extreme caution. The port of Acapulco was closed for small vessels, and a moderate to high alert for strong winds and rain was noted. The storm's outer bands produced torrential rains over Chiapas and Tabasco, with 24-hour accumulations of up to in Tabasco. Also in the state, four rivers overflowed their banks; one river received of excess water in a single day. Low-lying areas, such as grasslands and pastures, experienced major flooding, prompting farmers to evacuate their livestock. In Villahermosa, the downpours resulted in the collapse of water drains, flooding many streets and stranding cars. Across Guerrero, three people were initially reported missing, but all three were later found. Twenty-thousand residents were advised to evacuated due to rising floodwaters.

Biography He was born in around 1246. He was a monk of Hilandar (hence his epithet), the Serbian monastery of Mount Athos, and a priest of King Stefan Uro≈° III Deƒçanski (r. 1322‚Äì31). He focused on expanding and strengthening the cult of St. Simeon the Myrrhflowing (Stefan Nemanja) (r. 1166‚Äì1196), and Saint Sava, who had created the main focus of the Serb ethnic and cultural identity.Alexander Kazhdan (editor), ‚ÄûThe Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium‚Äú, Oxford, 1991. Surrounded by the beauty of nature and the mystical atmosphere of Hilandar and Mount Athos itself, he transferred some of the beauty and serenity into his literary works, characterized by its poetic quality. He was an original and prolific writer. In the period between 1292 and 1310 he wrote a Common Canon to Christ, St. Simeon Nemanja and St. Sava, The Life of Saint Sava, Encomium to Ss. Simeon and Sava, Common Canon to Ss. Simeon and Sava, Canon to Ss. Simeon and Sava, The Life of St. Peter of Kori≈°, Office for St. Sava, and Office for St. Peter of Kori≈°. Teodosije's biography The Life of St. Sava as compared to Domentijan's, is written in less ornamented style. It is relatively free from mystical and theological elements, and it shows the author's mastery in the choice of biographical details narrated. He wrote several canons, liturgical, and other works dedicated to Saints Simeon and Sava, as well as he work on the Life of St. Peter of Korish, which is viewed as the artistically most successful art of old Serbian literature. In the work, as in the Life of St. Sava, despite the strict form of biographies, it was written with a fluent and vivid style of storytelling. The narrative is sometimes dramatic, and always from the character's point of view. Because of such tendencies (as noted in the great writer of Orthodox tradition, Dostoevsky, who also drew the literary skills from hagiographic literature), this work has been called a \\"novel\\", and Theodosius being the first Serbian novelist. Teodosije's Life of St. Sava, is viewed as a successful composition, one of the first complex parts in old Serbian literature. Teodosije was also an innovator, one who tells the many times told story, through new compositional structure of sentences and word processing, and refresh the story. In this way, the Serbian historical characters were taken from the literary monotony in which the writers of the past centuries had put them in, enlightening them from different angles. The frequent verbal sensibility shows the talent of Teodosije. He is included in The 100 most prominent Serbs. Teodosije is one of the few medieval writers whose works we can find explicit poetic views. They coincide with known Horace's thinking about the function of literature, but the ways in which these attitudes are brought into the Serbian medieval times are very specific. Their roots in ancient Greece (Aristotle), which is elaborated on by Hellenistic writers, and through late antique and early Byzantine, and later Athonite, enters the width of Teodosije.

He worked for several aid and political organizations in Somalia after witnessing the conditions in the region during his leave from the Canadian military in 1987. He served as the Coordinator for the Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea (SEMG) from 2008-2012. He is now a Director at a think tank, Sahan Research. Early life Matthew Bryden was born in the UK and grew up in Canada. He attended Upper Canada College in Toronto, where he graduated in 1985. Bryden joined the Canadian Forces Reserve and became interested in African aid programs after visiting the region during a military leave in 1987. Career Bryden was hired by the Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (CARE) program in January 1988 and the following year joined the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in Berbera, Somalia. He was reassigned to Nairobi, Kenya in August 1990, when the UN evacuated non-essential staff. In 1992, Bryden was appointed Special Advisor to the Canadian Ambassador on Somali Affairs. He led the War-torn Societies Project (WSP) from 1996 to 2003 and in the two years following acted as the Horn of Africa Director for the International Crisis Group (ICG). From 2007 to 2008, he served as an adviser on Somali affairs for the United States Agency for International Development USAID and the US embassy. In 2008, Bryden was appointed Coordinator of the Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea (SEMG), which monitored violations of the general and complete arms embargo introduced by United Nations Security Council Resolution 733 on 23 January 1992. According to journalist Robert Young Pelton, under Bryden's tenure the SEMG's reports grew, \\"accusing both friend and foe of violations.\\" This included reports that the United States violated the embargo when making anti-terrorist missile strikes, and an incident where two journalists were detained under suspicions of being mercenaries. Bryden said he considered any munitions delivered to Somalia to be a breach of the embargo. Bryden accused then Puntland President Abdirahman Farole and other government officials of being on the payroll of pirate gangs. Abdirahman Farole in turn accused Bryden of using his position at the SEMG to create inflated reports of munitions in the neighboring regions of Somaliland in order to support his interest in the secession of Somaliland. He noted Bryden was married to a well-connected woman from the region's dominant, Isaaq clan. In 2012 a report by the SEMG was leaked accusing Sharif Sheikh Ahmed of corruption and Ahmed responded in July by saying Bryden was \\"against peace in Somalia.\\" That summer Bryden was no longer with the UN. Bryden is now considered a leading authority on the insurgency in Somali. As of 2013, Bryden was serving as a Director at Sahan Research, an independent Nairobi-based think tank. Personal life Bryden is married with three children and, as of 2010, lives in Nairobi, Kenya. Bryden speaks fluent Somali, and holds a Somaliland passport. Bibliography * New hope for Somalia?

He was considered the ‚Äústrong man‚Äù of the Tupou family despite coming from a lower lineage, and he used his power to depose the 12th Tu‚ÄôI Kanokupolu, Tupoumoheofo, who was of the higher line.H. J. M. Claessen, A Survey of the History of Tonga: Some New Views1989 Tuku‚Äôaho placed instilled his own father, Mumui, as the 13th Tu‚ÄôI Kanokupolu and then took the title for himself upon Mumui's death. Tuku‚Äôaho reigned Tonga as a tyrant, for which he was assassinated by a team of high chiefs. His death sparked a civil war that lasted for nearly a half century. War with Tupoumoheofo Around the year 1792, when Mukuiha‚Äôame‚Äôa vacated his title of Tu‚Äôi Kanokupolu, the recently deceased Tu‚Äôi Tonga's high ranking wife Tupoumoheofo declared herself the replacement.Paul van der Grijp, Anthropos, Strategic Murders: Social Drama in Tonga's Chiefly System2004 Historians debate the appropriateness of her action as a female, but the immediate result was to incense Tuku‚Äôaho, who hoped for and expected the title to pass on to his father. From ‚ÄòEua where he was now governor,Phyllis Herda, The Journal of Pacific History, Gender, Rank and Power in 18th Century Tonga: The Case of Tupoumoheofo Tuku‚Äôaho began publicly denouncing Tupoumoheofo. He further instigated conflict by seizing some of her estates.I. C. Campbell, The Journal of Pacific History, The Demise of the Tu'i Kanokupolu Tona 1799-1827 Tupoumoheofo would not step down. Mumui, Tuku‚Äôaho, and Tupoumoheofo all shared ancestry through Ma‚Äôafu‚Äôotu‚Äôitonga, the 6th Tu‚ÄôI Kanokupolu, but Tupoumoheofo‚Äôs branch was of higher rank, which helped give her support among many of the Tongatapu chiefs. With Tupoumoheofo in power for less than a full year, probably around the year 1793, Tuku‚Äôaho attacked her supporters with an army, chasing her into the protection of the powerful chiefs of Hihifo. In the face of overwhelming force, the chiefs negotiated her exile to Ha‚Äôapai, leaving Tuku‚Äôaho to implant Mumui as the 13 Tu‚ÄôI Kanokupolu and Ma‚Äôulupekotofa as Tu‚ÄôI Tonga. The exiled Tupoumoheofo made one last attempt to reclaim her title by raising an army and attacking Tongatapu, but she was repelled and chased back to Kauvai Island in northern Ha‚Äôapai, where her army was slaughtered. Tupoumoheofo survived and returned to Vava‚Äôu. She made no more attempts to regain power. Mumui as Tu‚ÄôI Kanokupolu Mumui helped bring stability after a brief period of war. By 1795 the three main chiefly titles of Tu‚Äôi Kanokupolu, Tu‚Äôi Ha‚Äôatakalaua, and Tu‚Äôi Tonga had been restored to ‚Äúmen with solid traditional claims of descent and fitness. Just before he died, he tried maintaining stability by trying to pass his Tu‚ÄôI Kanokupolu title on to Mulikihame‚Äôa, who was the next most ‚Äúpremier‚Äù chief on Tongatapu and came from a more superior branch of the family lineage. He had also previously held the title as the 11th Tu‚Äôi Kanokupolu before he was likely forced to resign in 1790 or 1791. The choice of Mulikihame‚Äôa was in line with the Tongan tradition of adelphic succession and was unlikely to cause any political problems. Some surmise that Mumui passed over his own son because he anticipated Tuku‚Äôaho's \\"excesses and cruelties\\" of power. Tuku‚Äôaho as Tu‚ÄôI Kanokupolu Though Mumui could strongly suggest his own replacement, the decision of the next Tu‚Äôi Kanokupolu was made by election of the chiefs of Ngata in Hihigo. Tuku‚Äôafo felt indignant by being passed over for the title, having most likely placed his father as Tu‚ÄôI Kanokupolu to improve the power of their lineage and receive the title in the future. As the ‚Äústrong man‚Äù of the Tupou family, Tuku‚Äôaho convinced the chiefs to elect him as the 14th Tu‚Äôi Kanokupolu. The action steered power towards a lesser lineage and angered many chiefs. Tuku‚Äôaho behaved as a tyrant. He waged war against Ha‚Äôapai and Vava‚Äôu, spreading ‚Äúhavoc‚Äù and ‚Äúfear‚Äù throughout Tonga. A European eyewitness described Tuku‚Äôaho tying enemies to trees and burning them alive. Other missionaries said he cut off the hand of a man who had committed a misdemeanor. Another was ‚Äúbound with stretched arms and two women were made to put burning torches under his armpits. He had the left arm of twelve of his cooks amputated not to punish any crime but as a ‚Äúpersonal reminder to make clear that they were his.‚Äù. One woman was sawed in half while still alive. William Mariner, a British sailor stranded in Tonga from 1806 to 1810 described Tuku‚Äôaho's reputation as ‚Äúof a vindictive and cruel turn of mind, taking every opportunity to exert his authority; and frequently in a manner not only cruel but wanton‚Äù, though it must be said that Mariner's host was Tuku‚Äôaho's enemy, Finau Ulukalala. Assassination Tuku‚Äôaho earned many enemies due to his tyranny and ignorance of traditional succession. The April 1799 ritual reburial of 18th Tu‚Äôi Ha‚Äôatakalaua, Toafunaki, brought chiefs from many Tongan islands, and a group of them decided to assassinate Tuku‚Äôaho. They were led by Tupouniua who felt particularly oppressed by Tuku‚Äôaho's reign. He was joined by many power men such as Finau ‚ÄòUlukalala II, Mulikiha‚Äôame‚Äôa, and Fatafehi Fuanunuiava. Finau ‚ÄòUlukalala was avenging his father, Finau ‚ÄòUlukalala I, who was not given the governorship of Vav‚Äôu by Tuku‚Äôaho that he thought he deserved. Mulikiha‚Äôame‚Äôa was still angry at not receiving the Tu‚Äôi Kanokupolu title years earlier. Fatafehi Fuanunuiava, the son of the 36thTu‚ÄôI Tonga Paulaho, also felt eligible for the Tu‚Äôi Kanokupolu title. William Mariner describes the assassination in detail: > ‚ÄúAbout midnight they again repaired to [Tuku‚Äôaho‚Äôs] house with [the > plotters], whom they placed around it as watchful guards, ready to despatch > all who might attempt to escape from the place. Of these Finow [Finau] took > the command, whilst Toobo Nuha [Tupouniua] entered, armed with his axe, and > burning with desire of revenge. As he passed along, on either hand lay the > wives and favourite mistresses of the king...He sought the mat of his > destined victim, where he lay buried in the profoundest sleep. He stood over > him for a short moment, but willing that he should know from whome he > received his death, he struck him with his hand upon the face. Togoo Ahoo > [Tuku‚Äôaho] started up, -‚ÄòTis I, Toobo Nuha that strike!‚Äù and a tremendous > blow felled him, never to rise again.‚ÄùJohn Martin, Tonga Islands, 1981 ed., The solidarity of the conspirators did not last long. Contests for power devolved into chaos in Tongatapu with Finau ‚ÄòUlukalala becoming ruling warlord over Ha‚Äôapai and Tupouniua his deputy in Vava‚Äôu. Thus began the civil wars that wouldn't end until the 1845 unification of Tonga under Taufa‚Äôahau (a descendant of Tuku‚Äôaho).

It has rough, fibrous bark on the trunk and larger branches, smooth grey bark above, glossy green, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and hemispherical fruit. flowers and buds fruit Description Eucalyptus bridgesiana is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, fibrous, mottled grey and white, sometimes tessellated bark on the trunk and larger branches, with rough, grey, fibrous bark on its trunk and larger branches. Thinner branches have smooth grey bark with whitish patches, shed in short ribbons. Young plants and coppice regrowth have sessile, egg-shaped, heart- shaped or almost round leaves arranged in opposite pairs, long, wide, with wavy edges and covered with a powdery white bloom. The adult leaves are lance- shaped, the same glossy green on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven on a peduncle up to long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. The mature buds are oval, long and wide with a conical to beaked operculum. Flowering occurs from February to March and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, hemispherical capsule, long and wide with the three valves extending above the rim. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus bridgesiana was first formally described in 1898 by Richard Thomas Baker and the description was published in Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. The specific epithet (bridgesiana) honours Frederick Bridges (1840-1904) for his \\"promoting the opplication of economic science to our indigenous vegetable products\\". Distribution and habitat Apple box grows in open woodland and forest and is widespread from near Stanthorpe in Queensland and south through the slopes and ranges of New South Wales and eastern Victoria. Uses The wood of apple box is softer than that of other eucalypts, and is considered poor for firewood or building timber. However, the honey produced by bees feeding on the small white flowers of the tree is of high quality.

It is estimated that the exchange took no more than 10 seconds, which authorities said suggested prolonged and meticulous planning. Mill√°n was abducted with his brother, who was developmentally disabled and later released at Mill√°n's request. Authorities discovered Mill√°n's body the very next day at Campo Morelia, a field about 10 km north of Culiacan. He had suffered a gunshot wound to the head. Fellow journalist and friend Osuna Encino said he believed Mill√°n's death was related to his political reporting in which he compared the administration to the previous government and that Mill√°n had complained against the intimidation of the press.

It is suspected, however, that Mill√°n was not kidnapped by this group. Instead, it has been speculated that‚Äîdue to his critical writing and analysis of local authorities, government, and political infighting‚ÄîMill√°n's death may be connected to his political opponents.  Impact  Mexico is considered one of the most dangerous countries for media in the western hemisphere. Mill√°n is one of nearly 80 journalists murdered in Mexico since 2000. His murder occurred just one month after the decapitation of crime reporter Yolanda Ordaz de la Cruz, of Notiver in Veracruz. The motive and of Mill√°n's murder is still under investigation, but friends and colleagues suggest that his political opponents are responsible for his death. Mill√°n, just a day before his abduction, helped to uncover and publicize a political secret within the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Mill√°n printed that the debt ceiling of the state of Sinaloa increased from $200 million, to $35 billion within a matter of months. In his article, Mill√°n accused Humberto Moreira Vald√©s, president of PRI, of intentionally increasing the debt, profiting on the increase, and attempting to cover it up. The next day, Mill√°n was kidnapped and killed. Of all the journalists missing or dead in Mexico in the past decade, none of the perpetrators of these crimes have been arrested or stood trial.  Reactions  Irina Bokova, who is the director-general of UNESCO, condemned the murder of Mill√°n on 30 August 2011. Bokova said, \\"It is essential that the impunity enjoyed by those responsible for such crimes in Mexico be brought to an end, for the sake of the basic human right of freedom of expression, freedom of the press, good governance and rule of law.\\" United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. 2011. \\"Director-General condemns murder of Mexican journalist Humberto Mill√°n Salazar\\" UNESCO Press.

They urged authorities to not rule out the possibility that he was murdered in connection with his work. The Mexican journalist group Asociaci√≥n de Periodistas 7 de Junio immediately protested outside the state capital of Culiacan and demanded the state do something about attacks on journalists. After two months the same organization was frustrated by the impunity in Mill√°n's case and compared it with another murder of two female journalists that occurred one week after his murder‚Äîthe murder robbery of Ana Mar√≠a Yarce Viveros, founder of Contral√≠nea magazine, and Rocio Gonz√°lez Tr√°paga, freelance journalist‚Äîin which authorities successfully arrested two suspects and searched for another.

Education  Lefgren received a bachelor's degree in economics from BYU in 1996 and a PhD in business economics from the University of Chicago in 2001.  Research  Lefgren's research into educational policy and the American educational system is extensive, and has been published in top journals, including The Quarterly Journal of Economics, the American Economic Review, and the Journal of Labor Economics. His work in this field covers such topics as principals' abilities to identify capable teachers, the effectiveness of teacher training programs, the effect of school on juvenile crime, and the effect of grade retention on high school completion, as well as many others. Notably, Lefgren has done work showing the impact of summer schools for students requiring remediation by comparing the limit of students who barely passed and barely failed the threshold of remediation. He has shown that parents value student satisfaction in teacher selection over student achievement improvements, except for poor students. Those parents from poor homes that request a particular teacher, ask for teachers who have reputations for student-testing improvement. He has also established that most of the test-score boost from good teaching erodes after a year. While the scores erode, Chetty et al. (2011) found that score improvements persist at some human capital level to improve the future wages of the student.https://economics.byu.edu/Pages/Faculty%20Pages/Lefgren-Research.aspx In recent years, Lefgren has also published in the field of econometric theory. His work with Brigham Frandsen, another member of the faculty of the BYU Economics Department, has been focused on such topics as rank similarity and partial identification. On one occasion, Lefgren was interviewed by a news organizations for his opinions relating to his research expertise. In a statement recorded in The Daily Universe, Lefgren expressed the view that \\"Raising the minimum wage in Utah probably wouldn't affect [people] much.\\" http://universe.byu.edu/2007/05/25/minimum-wage-hike-might-not-affect-utah- jobs/  Recognition and awards  Lefgren is ranked in the top 6% of economists worldwide.https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.person.all.html In 2007, he won the BYU's Young Scholar Award.http://universe.byu.edu/2007/09/04/top- faculty-staff-honored/ At the end of 2018, his research had over 4500 citations according to Google Scholar. He is also known for having won the competition of time spent standing on one leg in the fourth grade, although later he acknowledged that he may have let his leg down early, invalidating the record.Notes from Lars Lefgren in his applied econometrics class  Teaching style and reception  With a few notable exceptions, Lefgren's teaching has been well received and he is a popular professor within the BYU Economics Department. As of February 2019, he had 4.0 out of 5.0 on Rate My Professor, putting him above the average. His teaching is focused on building intuition and on developing a deep conceptual understanding of simple models. He is well known for his use of examples and hypothetical thought experiments to help students see the application of abstract ideas. Famously, the Dungeons and Dragons-inspired analogies of the \\"Die of Great Power\\" and the \\"Die of Correct Size\\" have been used to teach about the statistical concepts of size and power.  Personal life  On a more personal note, Lefgren has two daughters and two sons, because of his convex preferences. He also owns a poodle named Dexter.Notes from Lars Lefgren in his market inefficiencies class Lefgren enjoys the song \\"Come Dancing\\" by The Kinks because the first verse illustrates that capital is fixed in the short-run but flexible in the long- run.Notes from Lars Lefgren in his price theory class In terms of fashion, Dr. Lefgren has expressed a proclivity for wearing gold-toed socks, admitting that he is likely the youngest person in the set of people who frequently do so.Notes from Lars Lefgren in his advanced econometrics class When he was young, Lefgren enjoyed the game Dungeons and Dragons, having played a Barbarian all the way to level 18. This hobby has not, however, followed him in his post-college years. In response to requests to serve as a Dungeon Master, he has publicly declared that he has \\"hung up his dice\\" and no longer plays the game.Notes from Lars Lefgren in his advanced econometrics class Lefgren is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

G. Th. Graesse, is a Latin-German dictionary of Latin place names. Most recently updated in 1972, it is the most comprehensive modern reference work of Latin toponymy, covering antiquity to modern times. History Johann Georg Theodor Graesse (1814‚Äì1885), a librarian, art historian, and literary scholar, published the first edition of Orbis Latinus in 1861. Although this first edition already listed a considerable number of names from around the world, it contained large gaps, especially in its coverage of more obscure locations. There followed a 1909 edition, almost doubled in size, under the direction of the University of Breslau Professor Frederick Benedict (b. 1850), who evaluated previously published sources and historical works far more systematically. Benedict increased the keywords of Orbis, especially in regard to central Europe and the Middle Ages, but largely ignored areas outside of Europe, and did not consider material beyond the early modern period. Nevertheless, this work was re-released in a third edition, substantially unchanged, in 1922. In the decades after World War II, Helmut Plechl (b. 1920), together with Sophie- Charlotte Plechl, began work on the fourth edition of Orbis Latinus, adding many names of monasteries, mountains, and bodies of water, and taking into account material dating from antiquity to the Latin literature of the nineteenth century. This was first published in a one-volume manual edition in 1971, followed by a large three-volume edition in 1972. Due to the political instability of the period, the political boundaries of Germany as they existed in 1937 were used for the work. The Bavarian State Library made images of the three-volume 1972 edition available online in July 2010, and has also made a full-text searchable version available.

The novel has been adapted numerous times, including Les Liaisons dangereuses, an adaptation by Roger Vadim (1959), the eponymous Hollywood film (1988), Valmont (1989), Cruel Intentions (1999), and Untold Scandal from South Korea (2003). This version is set in 1930s Shanghai and stars South Korean actor Jang Dong- gun and Chinese actresses Zhang Ziyi and Cecilia Cheung. The film screened in the Directors' Fortnight section at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival, and the 2012 Busan International Film Festival. Plot Shanghai, September 1931: Wealthy businessman and serial seducer Xie Yifan (Jang Dong-gun) is introduced to his uncle's granddaughter, Du Fenyu (Zhang Ziyi), when his maternal grandmother, Du Ruixue (Lisa Lu), arrives at his apartment one day. Fenyu, a young widow who has just arrived from Northeast China (aka Manchuria) where the Japanese are making incursions, is staying at the country home of Madam Du, her grand-aunt. At a glitzy fund- raiser for refugees thrown by Hudong Bank chairwoman Mo Jieyu (Cecilia Cheung) at Yifan's nightclub, Jieyu, an old friend of Yifan who has never succumbed to his advances, asks him to rob Beibei (Candy Wang), the 16-year-old fianc√©e of tycoon Jin Zhihuan (Zhang Han), of her virginity. Jieyu wants revenge on Jin, for publicly dumping her in favor of a schoolgirl. Yifan turns down Jieyu's request, partly because he has another quarry in his sights‚Äîthe quiet and retiring Fenyu. Sensing an opportunity for some sport, Jieyu makes Yifan a wager: if he can seduce Fenyu without falling in love, she will finally agree to sleep with him; if he fails, he will sign over a valuable piece of land to her. Yifan accepts the challenge, but finds the virtuous Fenyu apparently immune to his charms. Meanwhile, Jieyu employs a different strategy to get her revenge on Jin, encouraging an attraction between Beibei and her young drawing teacher, college student Dai Wenzhou (Shawn Dou). Despite Jieyu's strenuous efforts, the relationship is never consummated; but when she finds out about it, Beibei's mother, Mrs. Zhu (Rong Rong), forbids her daughter to see Wenzhou anymore. With time running out, Jieyu suggests to Mrs. Zhu that Beibei should spend some quiet time at Madam Du's estate‚Äîand secretly arranges for Yifan to be there, to \\"comfort\\" Beibei. Mission finally accomplished, Yifan refocuses on seducing Fenyu, but finds himself in deeper emotional waters than he has ever experienced.

Composition The music of the song is by Adriano Celentano and the lyrics by Luciano Beretta and Miki Del Prete. It was released in 1966 as a double A-side single by Celentano, with \\"Chi era lui\\" on the flipside, composed by Paolo Conte with lyrics by Mogol and Miki Del Prete. Both tracks were arranged by Detto Mariano. The tracks' duration was 4:17 for \\"Il ragazzo della via Gluck\\" and 2:49 for \\"Chi era lui\\". History The song originally appeared in March 1966 in Celentano's album La festa and in the follow-up Celentano album Il ragazzo della via Gluck, released in November 1966. The song launched at the Sanremo Festival in 1966 where it competed with little success. It was eliminated from competition after the first night. But eventually it gained great favour with fans making it the best-known and most representative song of Celentano, with many autobiographical references; Via Gluck was the street of Milan where he lived as a boy with the family, and \\"eight years\\" (\\"...passano gli anni, ma 8 son lunghi....\\" meaning \\"...the years go by, but 8 they are long....\\") is a reference to the top of Celentano's recording career from 1958 to 1966. Italian covers In the same year of its original release, Giorgio Gaber recorded a cover version, that was published twice as an attachment to the Italian music magazine Pop. The first time, in March 1966, as a single containing \\"Il ragazzo della via Gluck\\"/\\"Dio, come ti amo\\" (\\"God, I love you so\\"), and the second, in June 1966, containing \\"Il ragazzo della via Gluck\\"/\\"Una casa in cima al mondo\\" (\\"A house on top of the world\\"). Giorgio Gaber also released a response to the song named \\"La risposta al ragazzo della Via Gluck\\" (\\"The response to the boy from Gluck Street\\"). In 2004, Adriano Celentano recorded the track with new lyrics and released it as \\"Quel Casinha\\" (\\"That Little House\\") in his album C'√® sempre un motivo (There's always a reason). The new text was sung in Creole with Ces√°ria √âvora. In February 2013, the Italian group Almamegretta, together with James Senese, Marcello Coleman and Clementino, performed the song on the fourth evening of the 2013 Sanremo Music Festival. International covers \\"Tar and Cement\\" In 1966, the American singer Verdelle Smith sang an English version titled \\"Tar and Cement\\", with songwriting credit to Paul Vance, Lee Pockriss, Luciano Beretta, Michele Del Prete, and Adriano Celentano. It was her only hit. \\"Tar and Cement\\" made it to #1 in Australia and to #38 in the U.S. It was also #6 on \\"Keener 13\\" from Detroit radio station WKNR for the week ending Monday June 27, 1966. Smith's \\"Tar and Cement\\" was included in the 2004 compilation CD, Girls Go Zonk: US Dream Babes. The song \\"Tar and Cement\\" was also recorded by Caroline Munro. It was a big hit for Joe Dolan in Ireland. \\"La maison o√π j'ai grandi\\" Cover of the single released in France, June 1966Disques Vogue/Vogue international industries (EPL 8427) It became a favourite song in France when covered by Eddy Marnay with French lyrics as \\"La maison o√π j'ai grandi\\". Marnay himself translated the lyrics from Italian to French. \\"La maison o√π j'ai grandi\\" was also performed more famously by Fran√ßoise Hardy and it appears on her album known as La maison o√π j'ai grandi. The album was released without a title and is identified chiefly by the song it carries, its major hit. Hardy had admired Celentano's autobiographical song \\"Il ragazzo della via Gluck\\" having seen him perform it at the Sanremo in January 1966. Looking back at the song in 2004, she said she felt an emotion of sadness at the time she heard the song for her mother, an assistant accountant, who had raised Fran√ßoise and her younger sister alone.Interview, Paris Match, issue #2902, 2004 \\"The Story of a Country Boy\\" Belgian band The Cousins covered the song in English as \\"Story of a Country Boy\\" on the B-side of their 1966 single \\"You Will Find Another Baby\\". The song was the lead track on the 1966 French EP \\"The new sound of The Cousins\\", a compilation of both their 1966 singles. It was the final release by the original band, which parted ways a few months after its release. \\"Lyckliga gatan\\" The song enjoyed very similar popularity in Sweden, when the singer Anna-Lena L√∂fgren sang it with Swedish language lyrics as \\"Lyckliga gatan\\". It was released in 1967 and was certified gold in Sweden and platinum and diamond in Norway. It used the melody of the Italian song, with completely different lyrics that nonetheless convey the message and moral of the song. \\"Immer am Sonntag\\" Anna-Lena L√∂fgren built on her success in Sweden and Norway by recording a German-language version of the song, as \\"Immer am Sonntag\\" becoming very successful in Germany, releasing tens of other German language songs. \\"Lykklige gate\\" A Norwegian version released in 1968 on a single (Triola records) sung by Margrethe Toresen. The Swedish version is still vastly more popular in Norway. \\"Der Junge aus der Via Gluck\\" Another German-language version was recorded in March 1966 by the German television-star and radio-presenter (for Radio Luxemburg) Camillo Felgen. \\"Z√°vid√≠m\\" Czech version of this song, which lyrics was written by Ji≈ô√≠ Grossmann, was performed by Naƒèa Urb√°nkov√°. \\"Het huis dat tussen rozen stond\\" Belgian singer Sanne recorded in 1993 a version in Dutch, with lyrics by Erik Van Neygen and Marc Van Caelenberg. \\"La casa donde yo crec√≠\\" In 1999, the Argentinian girlband Seducidas y abandonadas covered the track in Spanish as \\"La casa donde yo crec√≠\\". It appears on their second album, Las 4 en punto. 'Œó ŒπœÉœÑŒøœÅŒØŒ± ŒµŒΩœåœÇ œÜŒØŒªŒøœÖ Œ±œÄ' œÑŒ± œÄŒ±ŒªŒπŒ¨' In 2020, a Greek version of the original song was published on YouTube.

History Huntsville was ordered on May 1, 1862 by the Confederate States Navy. She was launched at the Confederate Naval Works at Selma on February 7, 1863 and finished in Mobile. She was finally delivered on August 1, 1863. She was only partially armored, with the armor plate delivered by the Shelby Iron Company of Shelby, Alabama and the Atlanta Rolling Mill. She had defective engines that were obtained from a river steamer and an incomplete armament, so was assigned to guard the waters around Mobile. Huntsville escaped up the Spanish River following the Battle of Mobile Bay on August 5, 1864. The city of Mobile held out another eight months, with the upper portion of Mobile Bay remaining in Confederate hands. She, along with the CSS Tuscaloosa, was scuttled to prevent capture on April 12, 1865, following the surrender of the city. The wreck lies where the Spanish River splits off from the Mobile River on the north side of Blakeley Island, just north of Mobile, until being located in 1985.

Depicted with racist imagery in the mainstream press after his arrest, he was given the nickname the \\"Brick Moron\\" as he killed his victims with bricks and was depicted as dimwitted. Convicted of murder, he was executed in Chicago in 1939. Nixon served, in part, as the basis of the character of Bigger Thomas in Richard Wright's 1940 social protest novel Native Son. Los Angeles murders Marguerite Estelle Worden. On April 4, 1937, Edna A. Worden (age 48) and her 12-year-old daughter, Marguerite Estelle, a junior high school student, were murdered in their apartment in the neighborhood of Bunker Hill, Los Angeles. Their bodies were discovered on Sunday, April 5, 1937, by the manager of their building, the Astoria Apartments, which was located next to the Angel's Flight stairs. Worden and her daughter were sexually assaulted and murdered with a brick that still had mortar attached to it. Los Angeles detectives linked the crime to the rape-murder of 20-year-old Rose Valdez, a young mother who was killed on March 2 as her baby slept in the same room in its crib. The police began searching for an African-American man who had been implicated in three similar assaults. On January 25, Mrs. H. W. Koll was attacked by an African-American man wielding a brick in Monte Sano Hospital. On February 3, a black perpetrator fractured the skull of Elizabeth Reis with a brick, in her hotel room. On March 28, Zoe Damrell was attacked and nearly murdered in her home by an African-American assailant wielding a brick; Damrell's assailant matched the description of a potential assailant seen lurking by Valdez's home before her murder. Chicago arrest Using the alias Thomas Crosby, Nixon had survived in Los Angeles by petty theft, racking up arrests for shoplifting and purse-snatching. He was also suspected of auto- theft. He returned to Chicago, where another brick-killing was committed. On the night of May 27, 1938, Florence Johnson, the Caucasian wife of a Chicago fireman, had been slain by multiple blows on the head with a brick, as she fought off burglars. Her sister, who shared her apartment in Chicago's North Kenwood District on the South Side and slept in another room, saw two assailants leave the house. Within hours, Nixon was arrested (on the 28th), picked up because of blood on his clothes and scratched hands. Confession Nixon blamed his accomplice, 19-year-old Earl Hicks, for Johnson's murder, which happened when the two were burglarizing her apartment. Hicks, who also was under arrest, put the blame for Johnson's murder solely on Nixon. Hicks told the police that Nixon had struck Johnson after she woke up and began screaming. Nixon confessed to another brick murder, that of 24-year-old Florence Thompson Castle, a Caucasian nightclub hostess, in her hotel room in 1936, which she shared with her seven-year-old son. At the time of the Castle killing, Nixon had written \\"Black Legion Game\\" on the dressing-table mirror with lipstick. (The Black Legion, a domestic terrorist group, was an offshoot of the Ku Klux Klan that lynched Earl Little, the father of Malcolm X, and African American laborer Silas Coleman. Each member swore an oath \\"to give his all in any ‚Äòwar‚Äô against Catholics, Jews, Negroes, aliens and Communists.\\" After they murdered W.P.A. organizer Charles Poole, in 1936, the group was destroyed by a police crackdown. ) Nixon had inadvertently left behind his fingerprints, which implicated him in the murder. After the Castle slaying, he and Hicks had left Chicago and wound up in Los Angeles, where he took an assumed name. Faced with the evidence, Nixon told police he had been the person who had written on the mirror. According to the African American newspaper The Chicago Defender, which was skeptical about the arrest and subsequent \\"confession\\" to the Johnson murder (the newspaper always put the word confession in quotation marks), the Chicago police had alternately beaten Nixon, and offered him sweets and strawberry soda pop. The Defender characterized the white press' coverage of the Nixon case as \\"lurid and inflammatory.\\" =Fingerprint evidence= The Los Angeles police, learning of the brick murderer caught in Chicago, sent on fingerprints lifted from a milk bottle at the Wordens' apartment to the Chicago Police Department. The modus operandi of the crime and the fact that Nixon previously lived at 803 South Central Avenue, Los Angeles indicated a connection to the brick bat murders. Nixon initially denied having any connection with those killings, but the Los Angeles Police's fingerprint evidence was decisive. After Los Angeles Police Chief James Davis announced they had a positive identification with the brick bat murders from Nixon's prints (which proved that Thomas Crosby was Robert Nixon), he admitted to killing the Wordens, mother and child. Having confessed to the Castle killing, Nixon was taken by the Chicago police to the scene of the crime, Chicago's Devonshire Hotel. Despite a crowd of angry whites, some determined to lynch Nixon, who were held back by a cordon of 20 police officers, Nixon reenacted how he climbed into Castle's fifth floor room from a fire escape. Nixon was held incommunicado in police custody for two weeks during which he confessed to raping and murdering nursing student Anna Kuchta in 1937, and assaulting three other Chicago women. He ultimately confessed to four murders in all, two in Chicago and two in Los Angeles. He continued to maintain that Hicks had killed Johnson with a brick at his trial. However, during his trial and in his appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court he denied these confessions and claimed he had been severely beaten and abused by police. No fingerprint evidence linked him to Florence Kennedy's death, nor did any blood samples. Witness testimony was also unreliable and contradictory.(Dale) Depiction by press The apparent senselessness of the crimes and the depiction of Robert Nixon as a dim-witted African American led the press to nickname the murderer \\"The Brick Moron.\\" Press coverage also called Nixon a \\"slow witted colored youth\\" and \\"colored moron.\\" The press reported that the Chicago Police had contacted the sheriff back in Nixon's hometown of Tallulah, Louisiana, and the sheriff had reported back that Nixon had been a pickpocket and a thief, declaring: \\"nothing but death will cure him.\\" The Chicago slayings were depicted as sex crimes, although sexual assault had not been a factor in the Windy City murders. In one notorious story, a Chicago Tribune story published on June 5, 1938, entitled \\"BRICK SLAYER IS LIKENED TO JUNGLE BEAST\\", used racist tropes in depicting Nixon when the police took him to the Devonshire Hotel to reenact Florence Thompson Castle's murder. The author of the piece, Charles Leavelle, likened Nixon to the \\"missing link\\" in human evolution. Describing Nixon climbing up the hotel to the fire escape, Leaville quoted a cop: \\"'Look at him go,' says a policeman. 'Just like an ape.'\\" In the first paragraphs of his piece, Leaville declared: \\"civilization has left Nixon practically untouched. His hunched shoulders and long, sinewy arms that dangle almost to his knees; his out- thrust head and catlike tread all suggest the animal,\\" evoking simian imagery common in the mainstream press at the time. Leaville summed up his description of Nixon: > He is very black-- almost pure Negro. His physical characteristics suggest > an earlier link in the species. Along with the depiction of Nixon in the tropes of the dangerous Black Buck, the press ran stories on Florence Johnson, depicting her as a mother of two. Newspapers ran photos of her children, bearing such headlines as \\"Orphaned by Crime.\\" The stories exacerbated racial tensions in Chicago, and the murder and resulting press frightened the white residents of Johnson's North Kenwood District and the adjacent Kenwood neighborhood, triggering white flight from the once-elite areas that now bordered black districts. Accomplice Robert Nixon sometimes had an accomplice to his acts, Earl Hicks (a.k.a. Howard Jones Green). Hicks was sent from Chicago to Los Angeles and taken to the Wordens' former room at the Astoria Apartments. He admitted to the L.A. police that he beat 12-year-old Marguerite on the head with the butt of a pistol, but denied taking part in a sexual assault or using a brick. Hicks said that he and Nixon stole eight dollars from the Wordens (equivalent to approximately $ in ). In addition, he confessed to attacking Zoe Damrell, for which he was sentenced to five-years-to-life. Nixon's defense in the Florence Johnson murder was to claim that it was Hicks who wielded the brick that killed her. The defense was not effective as the Illinois Supreme Court held that under the rules of felony murder, both burglars were responsible for the murder. The law holds both culpable: The perpetrator of a murder and any accomplice who does not actually commit or partake in the killing during the commission of another crime are equally as guilty of the murder.Comments relating the Nixon murders to Richard Wright's novel Native Son. Richard Wright As Richard Wright wrote his novel Native Son in Chicago, the local papers were full of the Brick Moron story. In his essay, \\"How Bigger Was Born\\", Wright admitted to copying details from press stories of the Robert Nixon case. > Any Negro who has lived in the North or the South knows that times without > number he has heard of some Negro boy being picked up on the streets and > carted off to jail and charged with \\"rape.\\" This thing happens so often that > to my mind it had become a representative symbol of the Negro's uncertain > position in America. Never for a second was I in doubt as to what kind of > social reality or dramatic situation I'd put Bigger in, what kind of test- > tube life I'd set up to evoke his deepest reactions. Life had made the plot > over and over again, to the extent that I knew it by heart. So frequently do > these acts recur that when I was halfway through the first draft of Native > Son a case paralleling Bigger's flared forth in the newspapers of Chicago. > (Many of the newspaper items and some of the incidents in Native Son are but > fictionalized versions of the Robert Nixon case and rewrites of news stories > from the Chicago Tribune.) Execution Robert Nixon was convicted of the murder of Florence Castle and sentenced to death. He was executed in the electric chair at the Cook County Jail on June 16, 1939.

While the other bears flee to the safety of their cave, Humphrey is left outside and is forced to hide in a nearby cabin instead. Once inside the cabin, Humphrey is horrified to learn that it is a hunting lodge, made evident by the many guns and hunting trophies hanging on the walls. As he starts to leave, he sees Donald Duck coming toward the cabin carrying a rifle. Humphrey desperately looks for a hiding place inside the cabin, and finally notices a large bear skin rug in front of the fireplace. He quickly rolls up the rug, stows it in an empty trunk, and lays out flat on the floor in the rug's place. Just then, Donald enters unaware that his rug has been replaced, or that it is alive. Humphrey nervously endures several uncomfortable and painful experiences, all the while being very careful not to let Donald know that he is a real bear. These include hiccups, a burning ember from the fireplace falling on his fur, going through Donald's washer-dryer, and being mowed with a reel mower, among other things. Off screen Humphrey spends the rest of hunting season in Donald's cabin carrying on his rug masquerade. When hunting season is over, Donald finally leaves and Humphrey breaths a sigh of relief. But just then, he hears a sound from the trunk in the corner and learns, much to his surprise, that the bearskin rug which he had rolled up and stowed earlier is actually another bear who had also masqueraded as a rug. The film ends with the other bear leaving and thanking Humphrey for taking his place.FilmAffinity Voice cast * Humphrey the Bear: James MacDonald * Donald Duck: Clarence Nash Releases *1953 - Theatrical release *1959 - Walt Disney Presents, episode #5.18: \\"Duck Flies Coop\\" (TV) *1961 - Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color, episode #8.5: \\"The Hunting Instinct\\" (TV) *1968 - Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color, episode #14.22: \\"The Ranger of Brownstone\\" (TV) *c. 1983 - Good Morning, Mickey!, episode #17 (TV) *1984 - \\"Cartoon Classics: Donald Duck's First 50 Years\\" (VHS) *c. 1992 - Mickey's Mouse Tracks, episode #15 (TV) *1997 - The Ink and Paint Club, episode #1.30: \\"'50s Donald\\" (TV)Movie Connections for Rugged Bear at the Internet Movie Database *2008 - \\"The Chronological Donald, Volume Four\\" (DVD) References See also *Hooked Bear *In the Bag *Bearly Asleep *Grin and Bear It *Beezy Bear Category:Animated films about bears Category:Disney animated short films, 1950s Category:American films Category:Donald Duck short films Category:Films directed by Jack Hannah Category:Films produced by Walt Disney Category:Films about hunters Category:1953 animated films Category:1953 films Category:Films scored by Oliver Wallace ","title":"Rugged Bear"},{"id":"33181237","text":"James T. Rodemeyer (March 21, 1997 - September 18, 2011) was an American teenaged-boy, known for his activism against homophobia and his videos on YouTube to help victims of homophobic bullying. His suicide was attributed to constant bullying, and led to the proposal of new cyberbullying legislation.  Personal life  Jamey Rodemeyer lived with his parents, Tim and Tracy Rodemeyer, and his older sister Alyssa in their home near Buffalo, New York. He had attended Heim Middle School in the past and was a freshman at Williamsville North High School at the time of his death. He was open about his sexuality, and faced severe bullying as a result of it. Rodemeyer's inspiration to help others came from Lady Gaga, whom he admired most. He often referred to her in his videos, and quoted her lyrics to provide guidance to others.  Activism  Rodemeyer encountered bullying throughout middle school because of his sexuality. Anonymously posted comments on his Formspring account included hate messages such as, \\"JAMIE IS STUPID, GAY, FAT ANND UGLY. HE MUST DIE!\\" or \\"I wouldn't care if you died. No one would. So just do it :) It would make everyone WAY more happier!\\". Despite this, he used his experiences to make videos on YouTube under the username xgothemo99xx to help others who were experiencing similar situations. He also made a video for the \\"It Gets Better Project\\", a website dedicated to preventing teen suicide.  Death  Rodemeyer was found dead by his older sister Alyssa in the backyard on the morning of September 18, 2011, in an apparent suicide by hanging. Before his death, he posted a final update on Twitter directed to Lady Gaga. The tweet read, \\"@ladygaga bye mother monster, thank you for all you have done, paws up forever\\". = Aftermath = The Amherst, New York police department launched a criminal investigation after Jamey Rodemeyer's death, assisted by Erie County district attorney Frank Sedita. The investigation lasted nine weeks, and included analysis of Jamey's home computer and mobile phone records. Although possible evidence of criminal harassment was found, these incidents either had insufficient evidence to prosecute or were expired beyond the statute of limitations. The investigation concluded with no charges filed. News of Jamey's death resulted in outrage by supporters worldwide. Following his death, Tim and Tracy Rodemeyer were interviewed by news media about their son and his struggles against bullying. Both parents took the opportunity to promote peace and equality in the hope of preventing occurrences similar to this. In an interview with Ann Curry on The Today Show Jamey's parents said that they, their daughter and son were still being bullied, even after his suicide. When his sister attended a school homecoming dance, Jamey's friends began chanting his name in support when a Lady Gaga song began playing. As a result, the very same bullies at the dance began chanting that they were glad he was dead. Upon learning of his death, Lady Gaga stated that she was extremely upset, spending her days \\"reflecting, crying and yelling.\\" She went on to dedicate her song \\"Hair\\" to Jamey during a performance at the iHeartRadio music festival at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, saying, \\"I wrote this record about how your identity is really all you've got when you're in school...so tonight, Jamey, I know you're up there looking at us and you're not a victim. You're a lesson to all of us. I know it's a bit of a downer, but sometimes the right thing is more important than the music.\\" Lady Gaga later met with President Barack Obama to discuss what his administration would do to prevent bullying in schools. Also in response to his death, reigning Miss New York Kaitlin Monte founded an online petition to bring the issue of cyberbullying (known as \\"Jamey's Law\\") to New York legislators. Shortly after, State Senator Jeffrey Klein proposed new cyberbullying legislation. The two joined to launch the New York Cyberbully Census. In October 2011, actor Zachary Quinto noted Rodemeyer's death as the genesis of his decision to come out publicly as gay, saying on his website \\"...but in light of Jamey's death ‚Äì it became clear to me in an instant that living a gay life without publicly acknowledging it ‚Äì is simply not enough to make any significant contribution to the immense work that lies ahead on the road to complete equality\\".Zachary Quinto (October 16, 2011). \\"10.16.11. nyc...\\" . Zachary Quinto Official Website. In response to Quinto's coming out (and in reaction to gay suicides caused by bullying), Dan Kloeffler of ABC News Now also came out. That same month another teenager, Jamie Hubley, was reported to have committed suicide for the same reason. While he never explicitly talked about Rodemeyer, comparisons have been drawn. The Fox TV show Glee referred to Jamey, when Finn (Cory Monteith) talked to Santana (Naya Rivera) about gay suicide in the episode \\"I Kissed a Girl\\"; it was further alluded to him in the episode \\"On My Way\\" when David Karofsky (Max Adler), a gay student tries to kill himself by hanging as a result of the (cyber)bullying that had befallen him because of his sexuality, although he is saved by his father just in time. On February 25, 2012, Michael Knote started a memorial page for Jamey after watching a news story about him. He founded a Facebook page and non-profit organization called \\"Have a Gay Day\\", referring to the double meaning of the word \\"gay\\"‚Äî\\"homosexual\\" and \\"cheerful\\". In 2012, the American metalcore band, The Bella Donna, produced a song based on the death of Jamey called \\"Don't Jump\\". The song has clips of one of Jamey's friends speaking on his behalf. The video has been posted at YouTube.

She is the author of the Longwe Framework for Gender Analysis. Longwe describes herself as a radical feminist activist. Early struggles When Longwe was a young secondary school teacher the government refused to grant her maternity leave. This violated the government's obligation under an International Labour Organization convention. Longwe formed a lobbying group that succeeded in forcing the government to introduce maternity leave for teachers in 1974. In another run-in during her career as a teacher, she insisted on wearing trousers to school. The issue was escalated all the way to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Education. In 1984, Longwe was a founding member of the Zambia Association for Research and Development. This group played a role in ensuring that the Zambian government ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Women's Empowerment Framework Longwe developed the Women's Empowerment Framework, or Longwe Framework, published in 1990. This Gender analysis framework helps planners understand the practical meaning of women's empowerment and equality, and then to evaluate whether a development initiative supports this empowerment. The basic premise is that women's development can be viewed in terms of five levels of equality: welfare, access, \\"conscientization\\", participation and control. Empowerment is essential at each of these levels. Welfare addresses basic needs, and access addresses ability to use resources such as credit, land and education. \\"Conscientization\\" is a key element of the framework: recognition that discrimination creates gender-related problems and women may themselves contribute to this discrimination. With participation, women are equal to men in making decisions, and with control the balance of powers between the genders is equal. Views and controversy In 1992, Longwe successfully sued the Intercontinental Hotel when she was refused entry to a bar in the hotel because she was not accompanied by a male. She won the case in the High Court of Zambia on the basis that discrimination against her sex was against the constitution. Longwe was chairperson of the African Women's Development and Communications Network (FEMNET) between 1997 and 2003. FEMNET, which was established in 1988, has the goal of assisting NGOs to contribute to women's development, equality and rights, and to provide an infrastructure for information and empowerment. In 1998 Longwe said that the school system contributes to women's subordination, so lack of schooling should not be seen as a cause for the low socioeconomic status of women. Longwe has been outspoken in criticizing lack of progress in programs to reduce the marginalization of women since the 1985 World Conference on Women in Nairobi. She has said \\"Gender policies have a strange tendency to 'evaporate' within international development agencies\\". She talks of the \\"patriarchal cooking pot ... filled with patriarchal bias, implicit in the agency's values, ideology, development theory, organizational systems and procedures\\". Her views on roadblocks have been criticized by workers in the Oxfam agency as being too extreme. Longwe was awarded the 2003 Africa Prize for Leadership.

Hybrids produced by the pairing of a rosy-faced lovebird (or peach-faced lovebird) with one of the \\"eye-ring\\" species (i.e. those species which have a prominent area of white bare skin encircling the eye, Fischer's lovebird being a typical example) are usually sterile, whereas crosses between the \\"eye-ring\\" species are often fertile.  Behaviors  Primitive species pairing takes places when the birds are about four months old. Prior to that they are completely dependent of their parents even thought they have already developed adult plumage. In some species, pairing takes place even sooner, around two months of age and at that time they still have their juvenile plumage. It usually takes no more than a few hours to determine if lovebirds are lifelong partners or not. When birds reach their sexual maturity, their behaviors become more elaborate. One common behavior amongst female species is their active aggression to the male species when he is trying to woo her. The male's response is a combination of fear, sexual appetite, aggression and frustration. Using hear and sexual appetite as his primary motivation, the male first approaches his mate by sliding toward and then moving away from her all while turning around his perch. This is common to all species, and is called ‚Äúswitch-sliding‚Äù. More behaviors associated with frustration from the male species include squeak twittering. This is common between three species- the Madagascar lovebird, the Abyssinian lovebird, and the red-faced lovebird. ‚ÄúSqueak-twittering‚Äù is when the male lets out a series of high-pitched sounds when the female stops him and disappears into the nest. These sounds can vary in pitch and purity of tone and also have no recognizable rhythm. In species such like the peach-faced and all four types of white-eye-ringed forms, their squeak twittering is different. There is less variability in pitch and purity but there is also a distinct rhythm. Another behavior is head scratching. It usually occurs out of frustration and usually involves the foot that is closest to the female at the time.  Courtship feeding  This is the transfer of regurgitated food from one partner is the pair to the other. In most species it is the female transferring food to her male partner. But in species such as the peach-faced and white-eye-ringed, it is the male's responsibility.  Copulation  Females indicate when they are ready to copulate. She adjusts the feathers of her head. The more she fluffs up her feathers, the more readily she is which encourages the male even more. When finally ready, she will lean forward and raise her head and tail. This gesture is not common for all species, especially in primitive species. It is a recent evolution for female bird species. When birds first pair together, they are awkward. The male makes many mistakes, which make the female threaten and thwart towards their mate. After time, the male learns and causes the female less aggravation.  Disagreements  Disagreements between members of the same species are handled differently than nesting pairs. There are elaborate patterns of threats and appeasement. Some examples include a series of long, rapid strides toward opponent, which suggests aggression. Ruffling of feathers indicates fear and the will to escape. Submission can be shown by fleeing, being quiet, turning its head away from their opponent or fluffing its plumage. Because of these codes used between birds, this results in little to no actual fights happening. Although, when they do occur, the birds literally tear each other apart. Display fighting is common amongst recently evolved species. This fake fighting primarily consists of bill fencing, which consists of the birds parrying and thrusting their bills and aiming sharp nips at their opponents‚Äô toes.

Its goal was to train a planned 36,000 Naval Reserve officers for commands in the vastly-expanding U.S. Navy fleet being built up in preparation for the United States' entry into World War II. To achieve this, several new Naval Reserve Midshipmen's Schools were established mainly on college campuses around the country. Between 1940 and 1945 their junior officer candidates, many alumni of the Navy's V-12 training, completed a 30-day indoctrination course before entering the midshipman school's 90-day V-7 Navy College Training Program. After successful completion, graduates were commissioned as ensigns in the U.S. Naval Reserve. The majority entered into active duty with the U.S. fleet in the Pacific Theater during the war. History ensign The first United States Naval Reserve Midshipman's school conducting V-7 training was established on board the converted battleship USS Illinois (BB-7) in New York City during the spring of 1940. Others followed at Columbia University, Cornell University, Northwestern University, University of Notre Dame, and Smith College. Enrollment closed in August 1945. =V-7 program= The V-7 program of voluntary training for officer candidates was announced on June 26, 1940 by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Its goal was to rapidly train 36,000 young officers needed to meet the demands of a vastly expanding naval fleet being built up in preparation for U.S. entry into World War II. By March 1941, eighteen months into the global conflict and nine months before Pearl Harbor, the Navy had only 18,000 officers. Most were stationed in the Far East, where the U.S.' lack of an Army presence left the Navy to bear the full burden in the event of war. End The Navy closed enrollment in the V-7 program on August 25, 1945. The 5,000 midshipmen still in training were permitted to complete their courses at Columbia University, University of Notre Dame, Cornell University, Fort Schuyler in New York State, and the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. =Schools= USNR Midshipmen's School Prairie State was conducted aboard the converted USS Illinois (BB-7) in the 1940s or 1950s. During the spring of 1940, U.S. Naval Reserve Midshipman School, Prairie State, was opened on board the converted battleship USS Illinois (BB-7) in New York City with Captain John J. London in command. The first class in the midshipmen program produced 264 new officers during the early days of World War II before the U.S. was involved, 232 of whom reported for active duty. The second V-7 class at Prairie State began November 22 after its officer candidates had finished their initial training cruise on the USS New York (BB-34) during the summer of 1940. A total of 480 junior officers from it graduated in February 1941. The V-7 course at Columbia provided the fictional setting for the early chapters of the World War II novel The Caine Mutiny. Cornell University The Naval Indoctrination School at Camp MacDonough in Plattsburgh, New York, opened on March 6, 1944, with a capacity of 2,500 and Commander Chauncey M. Loutrit in command.

Constructed at the end of the nineteenth century, the two were once prominent examples of Victorian architecture in the city. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. Architecture The I.O.O.F. and Barker Buildings were architecturally similar: both were brick buildings with stone trim, and both featured significant Italianate elements, seen most distinctively in their cornices. Few elements of other styles were apparent on the Barker Building, but the I.O.O.F. Building featured the prominent and large rounded window arches common to the Romanesque Revival style. However, the two were easily distinguished by their sizes: the I.O.O.F. was three and a half stories tall with a four-story tower on the corner, and eight bays wide, while the Barker comprised just two stories, and it was only three bays wide. The front of the I.O.O.F. was largely glass: all the bays featured large windows except for the doorway, which was itself illuminated by a transom light, multiple sidelights, and glass panelling in the door itself. Topping each bay were large windows with massive Romanesque Revival arches, which were sometimes seen as creating the appearance of an arcade; the windows of lower floors varied from narrow slits on the southernmost bays of the first floor to large windows with stone lintels in all bays of the second story. Crowning the building was a fourth- story tower, which sat above the front corner: built with a stone cap and stone corners, similar to the pilasters of the first story, it featured a very un-Romanesque ornamental balustrade. History As the city's oldest fraternal organization, the lodge of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows is one of Mount Vernon's most prominent civic groups. By the late 1890s, the lodge was sufficiently wealthy to purchase land near the county courthouse in downtown Mount Vernon and to erect a substantial commercial building on the site. The resulting structure was not used exclusively for fraternal purposes: local businesses and offices used the first and second stories respectively, and the Odd Fellows retained only the third floor for their meetings. Eight years before the construction of the I.O.O.F. Building, Hiram Barker purchased an adjacent lot, but he did nothing with it for several years; around the same time that the Odd Fellows were building their new lodge, he too arranged for the construction of a building. For many years, the primary occupants of the Barker Building were various attorneys, while the leading tenant of the I.O.O.F. building was the People's Bank and Trust Company. At the time of its founding in 1907, it was one of three banks in the city, but mergers ultimately led to the amalgamation of both other firms under the People's Bank. As Mount Vernon's only bank, the People's Bank began running out of room in the mid-20th century. Finding the Barker Building for sale, the bank purchased it in 1967 and modified the two buildings by removing the walls that separated them, allowing the bank's main lobby to be a single room inside both buildings. Besides this modification, the two buildings remained much as they had been constructed into the late years of the 20th century. Recent history Due to the physical merger of the two buildings by People's Bank, architectural historians deemed the Barker and I.O.O.F. Buildings to have become one bank. Because of their historically significant architecture and the lack of changes (other than the physical merger) to the building(s) since construction, they were listed together on the National Register of Historic Places in late 1985. Besides their historically important architecture, the two buildings also qualified for inclusion on the National Register because of their leading place in local history. Despite their historic designation, the Barker and I.O.O.F. Buildings are no longer standing; the prosperity of the downtown business district led the bank that owned the buildings to destroy them in the 1990s and to erect a new bank building on the site.Babcock, Chris, et al. National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Mount Vernon Downtown Historic District. National Park Service, 2002-01-02. In 2003, much of downtown Mount Vernon was designated a historic district and listed on the National Register as the Mount Vernon Downtown Historic District. The site of the I.O.O.F. and Barker Buildings was included within the boundaries of the district, but due to the recent age of the new building on the site, it was deemed a non-contributing property. Despite their destruction, the Barker and I.O.O.F. Buildings remained on the National Register for more than a decade, like the surrounding downtown neighborhood and the courthouse square across the street. They were finally removed from the National Register on December 15, 2011.

Bill C-205, An Act to protect heritage railway stations, was proposed by MP Gordon Taylor in a private member's bill which received support of all parties in the House of Commons. Background The railway was once the backbone of Canada. This changed with the widespread adoption of the automobile. The Trans-Canada Highway opened in 1962; Highway 2, the congested Main Street in every town in the busy Quebec City‚ÄìWindsor Corridor, was bypassed by the 401/20 freeway in 1968. Passenger train ridership dropped from a World War II peak of 60 million to less than 5 million in 1977. Federally owned Via Rail provided CN and CP an exit from the long-unprofitable passenger rail business in 1978. The railways retained ownership of tracks, railway stations and freight operations. A long series of Via Rail budget cuts from 1981 onward eventually left countless small villages stranded in the wilderness with no passenger rail service. The railways had little incentive to preserve or re-purpose abandoned passenger stations. Municipalities found provincial heritage preservation laws inadequate to protect railway history as interprovincial rail is within federal jurisdiction. CP's West Toronto station, closed when its last passenger train was rerouted in 1978,Via Rail \\"Western Transcontinental Services\\" timetables (with and without service), June 1 and October 29, 1978. was unlawfully demolished on November 25, 1982 as one of multiple closed stations demolished in that era, occasionally using similar tactics. About the Act A protected heritage railway station in Kingston, Ontario Designation of heritage railway stations and specific heritage features is made on the recommendation of the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada by the minister responsible for Parks Canada. Requests to the Board, in turn, typically originate from local entities such as municipalities and historic preservation groups. The protection of heritage railway stations applies to all railway companies under the Canada Transportation Act. No railway company may in any way alter, demolish, or transfer ownership of a designated heritage railway station without the authorization of the Government of Canada. There is a process in place through which any proposed changes can be reviewed and approved; public notice must be given to allow objections to be heard.Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada summary of the Act Violations of the Act are punishable by fines of not less than fifty thousand dollars and not more than one million dollars. Limitations Eligibility is limited to stations owned by federally licensed railway companies. A municipally owned station on an active rail line of federal importance (such as the 1856 Napanee railway station) therefore would not qualify regardless of historic notability or age. The protection ends when a historic station is sold. The Act only protects railway stations; it does not extend to other historic railway structures, such as roundhouses. The legislation also does nothing to require a railway to maintain a property to Heritage Canada guidelines or repair any damage, even as the structure declines to the point of violating municipal standards. By inaction, a railway can leave a historic structure in ruins. Kingston, Ontario mayor Mark Gerretsen has denounced this situation as a \\"loophole\\" as an 1856 Grand Trunk Railway station in that city is designated as being historic but \\"when CN lost its Crown corporation status they put in legislation that says if the building is ever sold the normal heritage act kicks in. Until it is sold, CN is not required to maintain it.\\" References See also * Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act, a federal act to designate and preserve historically significant Canadian lighthouses.

Her research on childhood depression was published in the Journal of School Health. She has been published in a number of other medical journals such as the Journal of Nursing Education. Her memoirs of her childhood entitled The Incredible Years were published in 1994 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the Netherlands from Nazi Germany.  Early life  Levy was born in Osnabr√ºck, Germany to Max and Lucia Levy. Her father and uncle were arrested and later imprisoned in Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Both men were eventually released in poor health and died in early 1939. Events of World War II were further unfolding in Germany; with the help of a family member living in the United States, Levy was sent along with her brother George to the Netherlands, specifically a children's home at a convent in Eersel, where they were baptized Catholic. Joseph Von Macklenbergh, a leader of a Catholic organization in the Netherlands informed Nazi officials upon inspection that the Levy siblings had one American parent, and this lie may have possibly helped them survive. The Nazis invaded the Netherlands in May 1940. After reviewing the Convent's records, the Nazis deported Levy, her brother, and other Jewish children in hiding to Vught concentration camp in April 1943. On several occasions, the siblings avoided a transfer to Auschwitz again with the help of Von Macklenbergh. Instead, they were both sent to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. In her memoirs, Levy writes that an assignment to Auschwitz would have been a death sentence, but being sent to Bergen-Belsen would mean that she and her brother may have hope for survival. In April 1945, some prisoners including Levy and her brother were forced on a train that circled the camp for thirteen days until they were liberated by Soviet soldiers near Tr√∂bitz, Germany. Shortly after being liberated, the Levys were sent to the United States in 1947, where they settled with family members in Chicago.  Scholarly Work  Levy earned a bachelor of science degree in nursing, along with a teaching certificate, which would allow her to work as a school nurse. While employed by Chicago Public Schools, she would go on to earn a master of science degree in psychiatric nursing from the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. She found a niche in clinical experiences in individual, group, and family therapy. \\"Not only was I expected to interpret the client's responses but I had to analyze my own inner reactions, and suggest ways to improve the therapeutic process,\\" Levy writes in her memoirs. She references Jewish philosopher Martin Buber as a major influence on her work, naming the inner dialogue she had to impose to bring herself to peace with her upbringing. Her first scholarly article, \\"Parent and Teacher Perception of Depression in Children\\" was published in November 1985. Levy's study correlated depression in children with parental perceptions and with teacher report card ratings of school achievement and adjustment. She interviewed two hundred and twenty children age six to twelve years using the Children's Depression Rating Scale. The study found that depressed students achieved at grade level in reading and math, but received lower grades for effort than nondepressed students.  Present Day  In 2005, Levy wrote and published a book titled The Spirit Builder, a biography of Dorothy Becker, a woman who organized a group of German-Jewish refugees to establish a retirement home in post-war Chicago. After her retirement from Chicago Public Schools in the late 1990s, Levy continues to volunteer at the SelfHelp Home in Chicago.

History =Creating the publication= On April 12, 1861, Confederate cannons fired upon Fort Sumter signaling the opening of the American Civil War. Consequently, this would also mark the beginning of a very important time in the life of American poet Walt Whitman. Whitman's style of writing drew from his attempts to better manage the psychological chaos he experienced. Now, with the Civil War, it was easy to see that all of society and the political structure had slipped into chaos. As the nation began to dramatically shift so did Whitman as his poetry during this time would begin to demonstrate his vision of democracy as people acting collectively and pragmatically to secure a meaningful political freedom. Regarding many of the poems in Drum-Taps, little is known about when they were actually written. However, in the winter of 1862, Whitman traveled to Virginia in search of his brother, George, whom he heard had been wounded in the Battle of Fredericksburg. After witnessing the vast amount casualties of war at the hospital, Walt was profoundly moved. For the next three years, he would devote himself to helping the soldiers. Many considered him a nurse and he acted as one, dutifully dressing wounds, assisting in amputations and administering medications. Whitman, however, insisted he be referred to as something simpler, calling himself a mere ‚Äúvisitor & consolatory,‚Äù one who brought ‚Äúsoothing invigoration‚Äù to the sick and wounded. This time in the hospital would have a major effect on his poetry with some of the poems in ‚ÄúDrum-Taps‚Äù being directly based on events transpired in these places. Whitman found great richness to being in the military camps. He was fascinated by the men and the ordinary objects they used. His experiences here would fill his notebook as rough-draft poems that constitute his 1865 publication. Years later, Whitman told Horace Traubel that Drum-Taps was \\"put together by fits and starts, on the field, in the hospitals as I worked with the soldier boys.\\" =Publishing process= How to go about getting this work published would prove to be a tedious affair. By June 23, 1864, Whitman was on the verge of a mental breakdown and grew to be so terribly ill from all the work he had been doing in the hospitals that he was forced to retire to his home in Brooklyn.Morris, Roy. 2000. The Better Angel: Walt Whitman in the Civil War. Oxford England: Oxford University Press. He managed to declare himself \\"gradually alleviated, until now I go about pretty much the same as usual\\" on July 24 and dedicated himself to, at last, publishing his collection of poems. \\"I intend to move heaven & earth to publish my Drum-Taps as soon as I am able to go around\\", Whitman told his friend and associate William O'Connor. He was excessively motivated to get his work out there, but an obstacle had developed. Ironically, it was the perception that his past works had been so highly controversial that had now scared off any legitimate publishers from wanting to buy his fresh compilation of poetry. If this were to be the case, Whitman explained to O‚ÄôConnor, ‚ÄúI shall probably try to bring it out myself, stereotype it, & print an edition of 500 ‚Äì I could sell that number by my own exertions in Brooklyn and New York in three weeks.\\" O'Connor was not as confident. He was justifiably concerned that a privately published book would not be available to a large scale. It was his desire to have this book cement Whitman's fame. He was going to have to wait for this however. Whitman's dedication to the hospital remained true as well for he would return to Washington as soon as he was physically fit to. Months later, on March 6, 1865, he received a letter from his mother explaining that George, who had survived the poor conditions experienced at many prisoner of war camps, had been released and was now going home to Brooklyn on medical leave. Walt now desperately wanted to be home. Not only so he could see his brother, but he also felt with the way the war was progressing so well now for the Union, this was the perfect time to publish his book. He was only able to gain minimal momentum however after receiving some money from the government. On this date, Whitman signed a contract with printer Peter Eckler to produce five hundred copies of Drum-Taps. Things began to proceed smoothly until the morning of April 15, 1865, when the newspapers told the story of the assassination of President Lincoln. Like the rest of the country, Whitman was deeply saddened by his passing. Over the following months he would split time between Brooklyn and the Capitol while also adding several additions to his compilation of poems. His poem \\"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\\" was extremely popular. It was this success (Roy Morris Jr. later wrote that this would be the final success of his career) that finally led to the publication of Drum-Taps, along with a 24-page insert called Sequel to Drum-Taps, on October 28, 1865. Contents and themes =Patriotism and the purpose of war= Whitman's writings in Drum-Taps appear to be separated into different loosely congregated sections without plainly saying this. Within the first group of poems, Whitman expresses both exuberance and doubts in regard to the imminent conflict. Both Lincoln and Whitman had a like-minded philosophy that the sole objective of the war was to preserve the \\"more perfect union.\\" Lincoln often expressed this belief and stated that the issue of slavery should be and only would be addressed if it contributed to this preservation.Foote, Shelby. 1958. Fort Sumter to Perryville, (The Civil War: A Narrative). New York: Random House. Print. p. 39. Poems in this first section such as ‚ÄúFirst O Songs of Prelude‚Äù (originally ‚ÄúDrum Taps‚Äù) demonstrate this vociferous Unionist pride. That poem, and others like it among the first part such as ‚ÄúSong of the Banner at Daybreak‚Äù, serves as a rally cry for the Northern population. These poems also demonstrate Whitman's belief that this war is a good thing for America's ideals. He believes without such a conflict and threat to society, those ideals could be taken for granted and lost to decay.Ignoffo, Matthew F. 1975. What the War Did to Whitman: a Brief Study of the Effects of the Civil War on the Mind of Walt Whitman. New York: Vantage. pp. 15-16. It seems that war takes binary oppositions, people at all different levels of society, and tethers them together toward a righteous and common purpose. However, Whitman also knows, at least aesthetically at this point, that war does have its horrors. He conveys this through the poem \\"The Centenarian's Story\\" in which a veteran of George Washington's campaign in the Revolutionary War recalls for a Civil War volunteer both the heroism and bravery of watching men charge willingly into terribly perilous situations and the horror of watching a large proportion of this mass of men be slaughtered. =Imagery= The next group of poems is unique in Whitman's work. These poems present a mode of seeing unarguably associated with the discovery and development of photography. Poems such as \\"Cavalry Crossing a Ford\\", \\"Bivouac on a Mountain Side\\", \\"An Army Corps on the March\\", and \\"By the Bivouac's Fitful Flame\\" all vividly describe an army that is on the move during a hard day's march, at rest as the daytime fades away, the sensation of marching into combat, and the sleepless night of a soldier sitting at a fire's side, respectively. It is with this vigorous imagery that Whitman describes the evolution of the participants in this war. For example, \\"By the Bivouac‚Äôs Fitful Flame\\" relentlessly describes the hollow feeling a soldier begins experience as his na√Øve enthusiasm for war slips away and he must now come to grips with the terror and suffering of conflict. The poet's sense of the ennobling struggle abates and now he presented with a challenge to prove his strength in the face of such terror. Much the same way that the Union must demonstrate its strength in the face of this conflict it has feared for over a decade. Whitman's imagery is interesting in how it shifts between poems. These poems have easy-rhyming rhythms that strip away his fondness of bombastic complexity and simply reports what is there (almost in the same way as a journalist). Conversely, poems in other sections have no such simple flow, instead using free verse which forces the reader to discover this higher meaning before they can even truly enjoy the poem. =Suffering in the Civil War= Drum-Taps also explores the great suffering, death, and injury that occurred during the Civil War. Poems range from the unequivocal suffering experienced by a mother who learns of the wounding and consequential death of her son in \\"Come Up Father from the Field\\" to the camaraderie of \\"Vigil Strange I Kept on the Field One Night\\" which tells the story of a soldier who watches one of his fellow soldiers die at his side before continuing on in the battle he is engaged in. During the night he later returns to the corpse to pay his respects to his dead friend and recall how much this young man meant to him in life one last time. \\"Come Up Father\\" gives a reader perspective into wide reach that the suffering of war has. It mocks any sense of security a reader might have in regard for war as it demonstrates that war can cause one suffering whether they are on a battlefield in Gettysburg or a farm in Kansas. John Burroughs, Whitman's early biographer, after gaining the perspective from Whitman of what his goal with Drum-Taps was, would write that \\"War can never be to us what it has been to the nations of all ages down to the present; never the main fact--the paramount condition, tyrannizing over all the affairs of national and individual life; but only an episode, a passing interruption.\\"Roper, Robert. 2008. Now the Drum of War: Walt Whitman and His Brothers in the Civil War. New York: Walker. General Robert E. Lee would also famously comment that ‚ÄúIt is well that war is so terrible ‚Äî lest we should grow too fond of it.‚Äù Ironically, it is this terrible pain and suffering synthesized in war that also creates such intimate bonds among the men who participate in, illustrated in \\"Vigil Strange.\\" This poem is interesting in that it does not stretch to melodrama to exaggerate the tragic reality of war but rather to mock the poet's futile effort to keep up with it. It is only when the sun has set and the battle ends that the poet can go properly grieve his departed companion, telling the corpse of the great passion he had for him in life. =From the hospital= The last major theme that is consistent throughout a considerable proportion of the poems shows the perspective of the war from the hospitals. The significance of this theme is that the poet chooses not to focus on the grand events happening on the fields but the consequences of those events and the repercussions they had. A poem that goes to great lengths to demonstrate the immense power of this after-effect is \\"The Wound-Dresser\\". This poem tells the story of a veteran who, in the beginning of the story, is being badgered by children to tell them war stories. The veteran proceeds to recall his days as a soldier, but only to say that they are not what he remembers best. He drops to his knees and with vivid imagery recollects his days working in the hospitals‚Äîthis, of course, being supplied by Whitman who claimed this time to be the most profound experience of his life. He remembers the soldiers‚Äînot as a whole or a group though‚Äîas individuals and by each of their particular wounds. The veteran comes to the realization that providing care to fellow human beings in need is the deepest experience that life can provide. This poem provides the reader with much of the experience of war without every directly recounting one. It shows how war is remembered by the outcome of it, how it was recovered from. It explains how the entirety of the fighters are not heading toward similar fates but how alike soldiers are given entirely different fates. Finally, it states that there is no great bond that occurs in this life than the one that takes place between one who will perish without assistance and the one tends to that person. Furthermore, the poem develops the idea of a tender so that he develops into a Christ-like figure. Another poem that describes this magnitude of aftermath is \\"The Artillery Man's Vision\\". The flashback in this poem is quite different from the one in \\"The Wound-Dresser\\". It does not pertain a memory being voluntarily remembered on but instead a fantasy that has abducted the sleepless veteran. This is interesting for two reasons. Its nocturnal setting where a man fails to get any sleep and is instead forced to relive some of the cruelest times in his life is consistent with what we now refer to as post-traumatic stress. The other is the severity that this occurs with. The dream is so vivid and so realistic that it could easily pass for reality, yet the man is able to maintain the truth that this is all an illusion. This leads one to wonder how faithfully this vision is depicting reality. In other words, it seems that the horror of the actual history is so brutal that it has taken over the imagination and is wreaking havoc.Mack, Stephen John. 2002. The Pragmatic Whitman: Reimagining American Democracy. Iowa City: University of Iowa. From these poems, it is clear to see the extent to which Whitman is able to observe the effects of war. Final note An essential companion to reading Drum-Taps is Whitman's autobiographical memoir, Specimen Days. This part of Whitman's work recounts his everyday experiences and the effect they had on his psyche. Relating mostly with the middle section of Drum-Taps, it reveals how the dominant metaphor for the war is a hospital, filled with wounded men who need treatment and dying men who need to be comforted.

No live individuals have been found since 1881 and it is presumed to be extinct.Baskin, J.M., D. Isely, and C.C. Baskin. 1986. Geographical origin of the specimens of Orbexilum stipulatum (T. & G.) Rydb. (Psoralea stipulata T. & G.). Castanea 51(3): 207-210. Overview Orbexilum stipulatum is thought to have been associated with large herbivore congregations. Rock Island in the Falls of the Ohio area was the shallowest part of the Ohio River, which historically was heavily used for the migration of American buffalo. The plant's population may have collapsed following the eradication of buffalo. If this factor alone had not extirpated Orbexilum stipulatum already, Rock Island and the associated rapids were flooded in the 1920s by the creation of US Dam 41, which sealed the fate for Orbexilum stipulatum at the Falls of the Ohio. Although all searches to rediscover Orbexilum stipulatum have thus far been unsuccessful, two other species strongly associated with buffalo that were once thought to be extinct, Trifolium stoloniferum and Solidago shortii, have been rediscovered on old buffalo trails and a mineral lick. Solidago shortii also once had a population on Rock Island. However, Orbexilum stipulatum differs in that in the 20 years it was monitored by botanists, it was never once observed to produce seed. This casts doubt as to its ability to have colonized beyond Rock Island.http://www.herbarium.unc.edu/9-10-07.pdf The Heartbreak of Psoralea  References  Category:Psoraleeae Category:Flora of Kentucky Category:Endemic flora of the United States Category:Extinct flora of North America Category:Plants described in 1840 Category:Plant extinctions since 1500 ","title":"Orbexilum stipulatum"},{"id":"33182448","text":"Club Deportivo Zapata is a Mexican football club that plays in froup 4 in the Tercera Divisi√≥n de M√©xico.

Dodge (August 29, 1854 ‚Äî December 16, 1938) was an undercover Wells Fargo detective, a constable in Tombstone, Arizona, and a Texas cattleman. He was born in Spring Valley in northern Butte County, California and was raised in Sacramento. As a young man, Dodge learned to drive two-, four-, and six-horse hitches, and \\"fast freight handling fruit into the mining camps.\\" He kept a store and managed a railroad eatery for his parents, but he was \\"lonesome for the mountains and the excitement of the mining camps\\", he later wrote. Dodge moved around, including him to Pioche, Nevada, and Bodie, California, and met notable individuals in the mining camps, including Dave Neagle, Pat Holland, and Nellie Cashman. He worked as undercover agent for Wells Fargo in California, Nevada and Arizona. In December 1879, he was working in Tombstone, Arizona and recommended that Wyatt Earp be hired as a guard and messenger for the stage line. The two quickly became good friends and Dodge supported Wyatt and his brothers in their troubles in Tombstone that led up to the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral and afterward. He was a personal friend of Wyatt and Virgil Earp and remained friends with them the rest of their lives. He was also a friend of lawman Heck Thomas. He was personally involved in the investigations that led to the demise of the Doolin and Dalton Gangs.Photographic Archive of Fred Dodge, Wells Fargo Secret Agent During the Earp Vendetta Ride, Earp borrowed a short, 22-inch, 10-gauge, double barrel percussion shotgun from Dodge. Earp used it to kill Curly Bill Brocius in a shootout at Iron Springs on March 24, 1882. Some Cowboy confederates disputed Brocius' death, and Dodge interviewed three participants afterward, confirming that Earp had killed Brocius. Dodge used the shotgun throughout his 40-year career and the gun was also registered to U.S. Marshal Heck Thomas. It passed through several owners. It was sold at auction in February, 2020, for $375,000.00. He kept a daily diary of his life, a total of 27 diaries, which he used as the basis for the book on the \\"Life and Times of Wyatt Earp\\". A book about the unvarnished recollections of Fred Dodge titled \\"Undercover for Wells Fargo\\" was edited by Carolyn Lake, who discovered Dodge's journals among Stuart N. Lake's papers. His diaries describe dozens of his cases, including stage robberies, train holdups, long pursuits across the badlands, even a law suit against Wells Fargo for \\"delay to a corpse\\". Fred Dodge and Morgan Earp looked alike, and when he first arrived on the stagecoach in Tombstone in 1879, Wyatt and Virgil promptly introduced themselves to the stranger who looked so much like their brother. Dodge posed as a gambler and none of the Earps initially knew he was a Wells Fargo agent. Dodge later teamed up with Heck Thomas to hunt down outlaws in Kansas and Oklahoma, and was personally involved in the investigations that led to the end of the Doolin and Dalton Gangs.Undercover for Wells Fargo: The Unvarnished Recollections of Fred Dodge References Category:1854 births Category:1907 deaths Category:American deputy sheriffs Category:People from Butte County, California ","title":"Fred J.

Charlie suggests that he and Rose take a weekend away, much to her delight. Alan continues to see his evil side which encourages him to continue collecting money from his relatives. Alan attempts to admit the truth to Charlie, but Charlie reveals that Rose is willing to invest and Alan decides to continue lying.

A March 3, 2011, telephone survey of 1,000 people found that 71% of them had an unfavorable impression of Sheen and 16% had a positive opinion of him. On March 7, 2011, CBS and Warner Bros. officially fired Sheen from the show after eight seasons. The official statement read: \\"After careful consideration, Warner Bros.

He first became known as a member of the rock band Happy End, but was better known for his solo work which began in 1972. In 2003, Ohtaki was ranked by HMV Japan at number 9 on their list of the 100 most important Japanese pop acts. Patrick Macias referred to Ohtaki as Phil Spector, Brian Wilson, George Martin and Joe Meek \\"synthesized into a single human being,\\" and called his work \\"an encyclopedia of everything that was great about pop music in the 20th century.\\" Ohtaki used three different ways to spell his name in Japanese, all pronounced the same way. Born as , he used the characters to spell his name in songwriting credits, and as a singer. Biography Ohtaki was born in Esashi District, in what is now part of ≈åsh≈´. Before joining Happy End, Ohtaki was guitarist in a group called Taboo with future Blues Creation singer Fumio Nunoya. Happy End produced three albums, Happy End (1970), Kazemachi Roman (1971) and Happy End (1973), before officially disbanding on New Year's Eve 1972. Ohtaki had already released his first self-titled solo album back in November 1972, which Macias described as probably just what Happy End fans expected; \\"tuneful folk-rock\\" and \\"fuzzed out country rock nuggets ala Neil Young.\\" However, Macias noted that this is the last time Ohtaki would create music like this in his career. He produced the rock band Sugar Babe, and continued to produce its members Taeko Onuki and Tatsuro Yamashita after the group's break up. Their only album Songs was the first release on Ohtaki's record label Niagara Records in 1975. Ohtaki's second album, Niagara Moon, followed a month later. Macias called it a record \\"where the artist is clearly having more fun than the listener\\" as it lacks truly memorable hooks and has \\"juxpositions [that] are often more jarring than impressive.\\" Ohtaki, Yamashita and brief Sugar Babe member Ginji Ito released an album titled Niagara Triangle Vol. 1 in 1976. The collaboration was cited by MTV as one of the six Japanese supergroups that changed the history of Japanese music. Later that year Ohtaki's third album Go! Go! Niagara was released. Although stating that the \\"kitchen sink abandon\\" from Niagara Moon was repeated, Macias felt that on this album the singer \\"hits a home run every time\\" by flat out recreating the beloved records of his youth, instead of simply trying to evoke them. Macias stated that although Ohtaki had done almost everything on 1977's Niagara Calendar before; citing the \\"merenge [sic], wall-of-sound, Okinawan music, and odes to baseball,\\" the difference is his increased vocal abilities deliver \\"another completely dazzling LP.\\" Although he produced all and wrote several of the songs on 1978's Let's Ondo Again, Ohtaki only sang a handful of them. The album is credited to \\"Niagara Fallin' Stars\\" and features various other singers such as Rats & Star and Masayuki Suzuki. Peter Barakan noted that the songs parody Western music and called the album a masterpiece. Ohtaki's 1981 solo album A Long Vacation is particularly well-known and highly acclaimed. It was one of the first albums to be issued on CD, was named \\"Best Album\\" at the 23rd Japan Record Awards, certified double platinum by the RIAJ and has been re-released in 20th anniversary and 30th anniversary editions. In 2007, it was named the 7th greatest Japanese rock album of all time by Rolling Stone Japan. Ohtaki released Niagara Triangle Vol. 2 in 1982, this time collaborating with Motoharu Sano and Masamichi Sugi. Following his 1984 album Each Time and its 1985 single , Ohtaki largely retired from activities as a solo artist. Instead he focused on composing for and producing other acts. In 1997, he released the single , which was used as the theme song for the TV drama Love Generation and sold over a million copies. The single was released in 2003 and used as the theme song for Tokyo Love Cinema. Death After choking on an apple and collapsing in his Mizuho, Tokyo home at 5 p.m. on December 30, 2013, Ohtaki was rushed to a hospital but died shortly afterwards. His official cause of death was a dissecting aneurysm. Ohtaki was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 56th Japan Record Awards in 2014. In March 2016, an album of previously unreleased material titled Debut Again was released posthumously. Referred to as his first album in 32 years, it features Ohtaki singing songs that he composed but which were originally released by other artists. The album Happy Ending was released on March 21, 2020 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Ohtaki's debut. It collects previously unreleased songs that were created during sessions for the TV drama themes he wrote in the 1990s.

Early life Anthony Gallo was born on February 3, 1939, and raised in Vandergrift, Pennsylvania. He is the son of Domenic and Saveria Raso Gallo. A poor factory worker, Domenic suffered poor health from a house fire in 1940. This fire killed Gallo's brother and influenced his later playwriting. Gallo graduated with an undergraduate degree from the College of William and Mary and a master's degree from the Wharton School. He then worked as a banker, a college professor [R12], and a food marketing economist with the Federal government. [External Link (EL) 10] He was also a pioneer in the renovation of historic homes in the Capitol Hill Historic District in Washington, DC [R10] . Gallo's career as a playwright began in 1980 when he visited Israel. Formerly an atheist, Gallo stated that he had a religious epiphany there. On his return, Gallo became interested in Judeo-Christian studies and the study of world religions. In his 50s, Gallo decided to become a playwright. [R18] His decision was influenced by his friend, Herbert Stein. After retirement in 1996, Gallo became a prolific playwright, dubbed the \\"Wharton School Playwright\\" by his friends. In 2007, Gallo married Susan Flaum Hesser, an information technology executive. Gallo has one son from a previous marriage, Thomas Augustus Gallo.  Writing career  Gallo has created over 60 works. [EL 10] Gallo owns his own theater company, the Seventh Street Playhouse [EL 3], and motion picture company, Eastern Market Studios [EL 8]. While he defines himself as a Judeo-Christian playwright, he states that all of his plays are meant for general audiences. His only guiding maxim is that there are a million roads to God, ‚Äúand I hope I am on the right one.‚Äù Two of Gallo's plays are Holocaust dramas (Margherita and Eugenio) and two are Biblical dramas (The Agony of David and The Last Days of King Solomon). Five of his plays are about American civilization (Vandergrift, Lincoln and God, Better than the Best, Charleston Revisited, and the Botticelli Cruise). Gallo's play, Paul, is an examination of the life of the Apostle Paul. Heathcliff is Gallo's first absurdist comedy [R18]. Gallo‚Äôs plays have been staged nearly 100 times in 40 venues including in Washington, DC: The Kennedy Center [Additional Reference (AR) Y], The National Press Club [R15, R16], Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company, Cosmos Theatre [R3], The Universalist Stage, The Warehouse Theater, The Corner Store Stage, and the Capital Fringe Festival; In New York City: New York University, New York International Midtown Festival/Dorothy Strelsin Stage, The Dramatists Guild of America [R5], Casa Italiana, Where Eagles Dare Theatre, Abingdon Theatre, and Midtown International Theatre Festival where one of his actresses won best supporting actress; in Maryland: The Greenbelt Arts Center [AR W], Silver Spring Stage/PF, and St. John's Church.. Three of Gallo's plays (Margherita, Eugenio, and Lincoln and God) are under contract to the Nederlander Producing Group for production in New York City. Margherita was scheduled to be jointly produced by Brown-Nederlander and the Seventh Street Playhouse in 2012.  Stage plays  *\\"Margherita\\" on the relationship between Benito Mussolini and Margherita Sarfatti, based on the Book of Judith.

He participated in Earp's vendetta during which four outlaw Cowboys were killed. Life in Arizona Tipton served aboard the USS Malvern during the American Civil War and drifted west afterward. He showed up in Tombstone in March 1881. When Morgan Earp was assassinated on March 18, 1882, Tipton was present in the billiard parlor where Morgan was killed. Tipton joined Earp's posse after it returned from Prescott. While escorting Virgil Earp and his wife Allie to the train bound for California, Wyatt killed Frank Stilwell who had been named as a suspect in Morgan's murder. Tipton rode with Wyatt, Warren Earp, Doc Holliday, Texas Jack Vermillion, Hairlip Charlie Smith, Turkey Creek Jack Johnson and Sherman McMaster as they searched for the other Cowboys thought responsible for attacking the Earps. He was with the Earp posse when it rode out to Pete Spence's wood camp where they found Florentino Cruz, a.k.a. Indian Charlie, who had been implicated in trying to kill the Earps. He returned to Tombstone to obtain more funds for the Earps and was arrested on trumped up charges by Cochise County Sheriff and Earp enemy Johnny Behan. While in jail he missed the shootout at Iron Springs on March 24 during which Wyatt Earp killed Curly Bill Brocius because he was bringing money to the Earp posse. After Tipton was released on March 25, he was given $1,000 to take to Earp, donated by E.B. Gage, part owner of the Tombstone-based Grand Central Mining Company and superintendent of the Grand Central Mine. Gage was also a prominent Republican and a member of the Citizens Safety Committee. He took the money to the Earp party at Henry Hooker's Sierra Bonita Ranch north of Willcox. Gage The posse members looked for more members of the outlaw Cowboys for a few more days before leaving Arizona on April 15 to avoid arrest warrants. Tipton remained with the group through New Mexico and into Colorado, where most of the posse stayed to avoid arrest warrants from Cochise County. Later life In 1897, Tipton ran afoul of the law. Customs agents arrested him for smuggling forged Chinese immigrant labor certificates. He was convicted in October and sentenced to 20 months in the Ohio Federal Penitentiary. The 53-year-old inmate lived only four months behind bars before dying of Bright's Disease on February 25, 1898. He left no known family. His body was buried in an unmarked grave at the Green Lawn Cemetery in Columbus, Ohio. In July, 2006, a government-issued tombstone was placed on the veteran's grave.

Most of them are descendants of Korean immigrant farmers from Mexico who left to Cuba in search of a better life. Today about 800 descendants of the Korean farmers live around Havana, Matanzas and other areas of Cuba. History of migration The first ethnic Koreans to arrive in Cuba came from Mexico's Yucat√°n Peninsula in search of a better life. In 1905, 1,033 Koreans set sail on a cargo ship from Incheon to Yucat√°n. Upon arrival, instead of the riches they had promised, all they found was the most menial type of labor. They were sold to 22 landlords and became sugarcane and hemp (henequen) cutters, toiling from sun-up till sundown in the dry and harsh tropical sun. Most of them settled there as field hands. On May 25, 1921, three hundred of them immigrated to Cuba from Mexico, hoping for better living conditions, but found them just as lamentable The Koreans' arrival coincided with a generally favorable economy in Cuba mostly due to sugar but soon sugar prices dropped drastically and there was no work. Land that had formerly grown sugar was now converted to growing henequen, and employed the Korean farmers as cutters. The Koreans, bringing their henequen-cutting skills from Mexico soon showed their good skills and productivity which allowed some to rise to specialized fieldwork and even become trainers and supervisors. Language Most Korean Cubans today speak the Spanish language. A Cuba-Korea culture center was built in 1921 that taught Korean writing and history in an attempt to remind the descendants of their heritage. But lack of funding shuttered the center and now it‚Äôs hard to find a descendant of the Korean immigrants who can speak the Korean language.

He was a director of William Dodd & Sons, textile machinists of Oldham. He was also a director of the Sun Cotton Mill at Oldham. He served for three years as a member of Oldham Town Council. He was Honorary Secretary for the Association of British Chamber of Commerce. He was also a Member of the Grand Council of the Federation of British Industries. At the 1929 General Election he was a Liberal candidate for the dual-member constituency of Oldham. He finished fourth, behind the two successful Labour candidates and the Conservative candidate, but ahead of his Liberal running-mate. He did not contest the 1931 General Election when the Oldham Conservatives decided to run two candidates and the Oldham Liberals chose not to contest the elections. When the Liberal party split in 1931, Dodd joined the Liberal National, a group that aligned themselves with the Conservatives. At the 1935 General Election the Oldham Conservatives, who were nominally defending both seats, decided to support Dodd, standing as a Liberal National, in tandem with one Conservative candidate. Dodd was elected, finishing second behind his Conservative running mate and ahead of two Labour and one Liberal candidate. During the Second World War he was a Major in the 47th Royal Tank Regiment. Major Dodd was also Tank Production Advisor to the Ministry of Supply. At the 1945 General Election the electoral arrangement between Dodd, standing again as a Liberal National and the Oldham Conservatives continued. However, this time Oldham Liberals ran two candidates, as did the Labour party. Dodd lost his seat, finishing fourth as Labour took both Oldham seats.

It is the 64th Oswald short by Lantz and the 116th in the entire series. Plot Oswald opens a barber shop. A hippo and its mother are walking along while the hippo sucks on a lollipop. A dog steals the hippo's lollipop, causing him to cry. The mother takes the barber pole and gives it to her son to lick. Oswald notices his barber pole is gone. He finds a tiger sleeping on the ground. Oswald finds the tiger's tail a good substitute. The rabbit then picks up a saw and cuts the tail off the big cat. Oswald returns to the location of his shop, and sticks the tail on the street just in front. In no time, customers start to come inside. The first one is a bloodhound who comes for a haircut despite not having too much hair. After receiving the service, the bloodhound attempts to leave without paying. This patron, however, gets grabbed by the cash register which appears to have a mind of its own and shakes every cent it could get. Next to come in is a small fuzzy spaniel. All Oswald wants to is trim the length of its hairs. As a mistake, he shaves too much on the little dog's rear, making it bald in that area. Nevertheless, the spaniel shows little emotion, and therefore leaves the shop quietly. The third visitor is a rat who doesn't seem to need any service. However, Oswald takes off the rat's nose and puts in a lightbulb. To the rat's amusement, the rabbit lights up the bulb by inserting the rodent's tail into a socket. The last client was a hippo who wants a shave. Although, the hippo's beard keeps growing back quickly, Oswald completes the task in three different methods. Things are going well for Oswald until the tiger, which awakened already, walks into the shop. The tiger is pretty annoyed about what it lost earlier and is seeking vengeance. When the rabbit tries to flee, the big cat nabs and swallows him, although Oswald is able to crawl his way out. Understanding the tiger's disgruntlement, Oswald finally picks up the tail and puts it back on the striped beast. The tiger is then overjoyed and runs off peacefully, no longer wanting to wreak havoc. Relieved of his trouble as well as feeling happy for the big cat, Oswald simply laughs.

He is named after his illustrated book of hours for Jean II Le Meingre Boucicaut, Marshal of France, created between 1410 and 1415, now in the Mus√©e Jacquemart-Andr√© in Paris. The Master of Boucicaut was a contemporary of the Limbourg brothers and with them belonged to the most important and influential illuminators of manuscripts of the period in Northern Europe. He was probably the head of a productive workshop or studio in which artists fulfilled commissions for the court, the aristocracy and wealthy citizens. It is known that the artist also collaborated with the equally active Bedford Master in Paris. The Boucicaut Master was advanced in terms of his depiction of light and perspective, based partly on developments in Italian painting. Based on style, many paintings and manuscripts are attributed to the artist. He has been associated with the Early Netherlandish painter, miniaturist, and architect Jacques Coene by some scholars, but it is now clear Coene was active in Paris too early for this to be plausible.

He was known as a stern critic of the local government. Narv√°ez was murdered in Viru, Peru on May 3, 2011, which was World Press Freedom Day. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Narv√°ez was one of three broadcast journalists killed in Peru in 2011. Career Julio Castillo Narv√°ez worked in journalism for more than 20 years. He was the host of the radio program Noticiero Ollantay. He had worked for Radio Ollantay as a Radio Programme producer. Death Shortly before his murder, Narv√°ez and another journalist had received threatening messages, and the show had been vandalized after Narv√°ez accused regional council member Herbert Jimenez Urquiaga of a suspected real estate business deal. Following the acts of vandalism, local police were contacted in a plea for protection of the premises and hosts, however, the request was declined. Having regularly received death threats, he continued to criticize the local government. On May 3, 2011 Castillo was shot six times by four men during lunch at a restaurant. Despite the public nature of his murder, his assailants escaped immediate capture. Irina Bokova, the director-general of UNESCO, condemned Castillo's slaying: \\"This crime is an attack on the basic human right of journalists and citizens to speak their mind and hold free debates about issues that concern them.

The third broadcast host Jos√© Oquendo Reyes, of both Radio Alas Peruanas and BTV Canal 45, was killed 14 September in Pueblo Nuevo. =Reaction= Many journalism groups have spoken out and condemned Castillo's murder, and have called for authorities to tighten and continue the investigation.

It is considered to be the first organised charity in Madras city. History In the 18th century, there were constant wars between the British and the Nawabs of Mysore, resulting in destruction of property and lives and eventually a famine in Madras. In 1782, a village headman, locally known as a 'maniakarar', established a gruel centre in his garden in Royapuram off Broadway. Soon after the war, the centre became a choultry for the sick and poor people. During the 1782 Mysore War, the government ordered that all buildings within a proximity of the Black Town Wall be destroyed. However, the choultry was exempted from this order. In 1807, the government made a substantial donation as more people started coming to the choultry. The Nawab of Arcot also donated a huge sum to the choultry. A hospital was constructed within the premises of the choultry in 1799 by John Underwood, an assistant surgeon with the company. In 1801, the hospital was combined with the 'Native Hospital and Poor Fund' in the choultry. The building was rented by the Famine Relief Committee which conducted a charity for the 'sick and the poor' along with St. Mary's Church. The Government of Madras took over the affairs of the choultry from the Committee in 1808. The Native Hospital and the choultry's land were taken over by the government in 1910 and was renamed Royapuram Hospital, while the choultry was shifted to the premises of the nearby Rajah of Venkatagiri Choultry where additional rooms were built. The hospital later become the Stanley Hospital. Etymology Originally, the choultry did not have any name of its own. It was given the unofficial name \\"Monegar Choultry\\" the anglised version of the term \\"Manyamkarar\\" (village headman) who ran a gruel centre nearby. The choultry today The choultry functions today as an asylum for elderly people. The Collector of Madras remains the chairman of the choultry's managing committee. There is an ancient temple at the base of an old tree within the premises, dedicated to the Hindu deity Periya Palayathu Amman. A rule still remains with the choultry that in case of the death of an inmate, the corpse will be sent to the Anatomy Department of the Stanley Medical College for study, rather than handing over to the relatives.

It was identified as significant for its interests in natural philosophy by Lynn Thorndike, in a chapter \\"The Circle of Melanchthon\\" in his multi-volume History of Magic and Experimental Science.Thorndike, Chapter XVII. Among this circle were found many of the most important early proponents of the heliocentric model of Copernicus.Elizabeth L. Eisenstein, The Printing Press as an Agent of Change: communications and cultural transformations in early-modern Europe, Volume 1 (1980), p. 618 note 145; Google Books They included Caspar Peucer who became Melanchthon's son-in-law, Erasmus Reinhold, and Georg Joachim Rheticus. Patronage came from Albert, Duke of Prussia.Robert S. Westman, The Copernican Question: Prognostication, Skepticism, and Celestial Order (2011), pp. 144-5; Google Books. Melanchthon's views in natural philosophy In lecturing on the Librorum de judiciis astrologicis of Ptolemy in 1535‚Äì6, Melanchthon expressed to students his interest in Greek mathematics, astronomy and astrology. He considered that a purposeful God had reasons to exhibit comets and eclipses.Jens Andersen Sinning and Frederik Julius Billeskov Jansen, Oratio de Studiis (1991), pp. 107‚Äì8; Google Books. He was the first to print a paraphrased edition of Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos in Basel, 1554.Heilen, S., 'Ptolemy's Doctrine of the Terms and its Reception', in Jones, A., Ptolemy in Perspective, p.70 (Dordrecht; New York: Springer. .) Natural philosophy, in his view, was directly linked to Providence, a point of view that was influential in curriculum change after the Protestant Reformation in Germany.Sachiko Kusukawa, The Transformation of Natural Philosophy: the case of Philip Melanchthon (1995), pp. 185‚Äì6; Google Books. In the period 1536‚Äì9 he was involved in three academic innovations: the refoundation of Wittenberg along Protestant lines, the reorganisation at T√ºbingen, and the foundation of the University of Leipzig.Sachiko Kusukawa, Philip Melanchthon: orations on philosophy and education (1999), p. xxxiii.

Typically humanist demonstrative methods, based around publications, were frequently seen. Rheticus became a great giver of books. Before receiving a call to Wittenberg, Melanchthon had taught at the University of T√ºbingen. There he had been tutored in astrology by Johannes St√∂ffler. The network included Simon Grynaeus who remained at T√ºbingen; Melanchthon dedicated to him his 1531 edition of the De sphaera mundi.Thorndike, p. 379. Melanchthon advocated astrology often: in 1531 in defending to Joachim Camerarius the work of the court astrologer Johann Carion, which he would later develop into a Lutheran historical chronicle;Thorndike, pp. 380-1. in a dedication to Luca Gaurico for a 1532 work by Camerarius on portents;Thorndike, pp. 383. in 1535 in an introduction to Jacob Milich's edition of Georg von Peuerbach's Planets, used again in 1542 with Reinhold's edition with a poem by Stigelius (Johannes Stigel);Thorndike, p. 380. in 1537 in a lecture printed with his edition of the Rudimenta of Alfraganus, stating the necessity of astrology for physicians.Kai H√∏rby (editor), Die d√§nische Reformation vor ihrem internationalen Hintergrund: The Danish Reformation against its international background (1990), p. 52; Google Books. Gaurico reciprocated, in 1540 printing eclipse observations from Melanchthon and his circle in a partial edition of Lorenzo Bonincontri.Thorndike, p. 392. Hieronymus Wolf, a philologist, passed through Wittenberg in the 1540s and was helped by Melanchthon.Thorndike, pp. 383. Stifelius (Michael Stiefel) had a preface for his 1543 arithmetic book; he had predicted the end of the world in 1533, had lost his living as minister in consequence, and had been found another by Melanchthon.Thorndike, pp. 392-3. Others mentioned by Thorndike are Vitus Amerbach, David Chytraeus, Joachim Cureus, Achilles Gassar, Joachim Heller, Johannes Hommel or Hummel, Johannes Mathesius, Johannes Mercurius Morshemius, and Johannes Sch√∂ner.

The Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology is a leading technical university in Haifa, Israel, with a history dating back to the early 20th century. Overview The historic Technion logo. New means of communication with big printing presses opened new possibilities for early Zionists. The extent to which technology determines history and the creation and destiny of nations is a question of historical scholarship, with the Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology cited as a striking example. Initiated with the help of increasing Jewish unity made possible by the new communication technologies of the Second Industrial Revolution,He who first shortened the labor of copyists by device of movable types was disbanding hired armies, and cashiering most kings and senates, and creating a whole new democratic world: he had invented the art of printing. (Thomas Carlyle, Sartor Resartus, 1833) the Technion was born 36 years before Israel declared independence. In that time it educated the engineers and brought the expertise to literally lay the infrastructure for a modern state. This included the fundamental infrastructure of electricity, water supplies and roads. Throughout the century ‚Äì since the laying of the first cornerstone in 1912 ‚Äì Technion has had a historic task in anticipating future needs in order to ensure the survival and growth of the State of Israel. According to a leading British journalist, the Technion story is exemplary for other groups caught in the seemingly impossible task of creating an independent nation: \\"For more than two decades before the state was created, Technion (Israel Institute of Technology) helped to lay the foundations of the modern state of Israel. The identity of the country as a player in the field of science and technology can be traced to the vision of Technion.\\" Technion would grow rapidly, becoming a global pioneer in biotechnology, satellite research, computer science, nanotechnology and energy. In 2004, Technion professors won Israel's first Nobel Prizes in science. In 2011, Distinguished Prof. Dan Shechtman became Technion's third Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, for his discovery of quasicrystals, or Shechtmanite. As it celebrates its cornerstone centennial in 2012, Technion City is a thriving world center of research and teaching, with 12,850 students and 80 graduate programs. In 2011, Technion partnered with Cornell University to submit a winning proposal to New York City to set up the Technion Cornell Institute of Innovation (TCII) on Roosevelt Island. =First plans= From the outset, The Zionist movement had a vision of the creation of a Jewish University in the historic land of Israel.Alsberg, Avraham P. \\"The Hebrew Technical College,\\" Zion (January‚ÄìFebruary 1950) Jews were often barred from technical or scientific training,Carl Alpert: Technion: the story of Israel's Institute of Technology. : p2. and without these skills and a grounded education in engineering, the Zionist vision of creating a nation would remain just a dream. In 1902, Theodor Herzl envisioned Haifa as \\"a great park....with an overhead electrical train.... a city of magnificent homes and public institutions all made possible by applied science, engineering and technology.\\" (Altneuland) Herzl infused political Zionism with a new and practical urgency. By the fifth Zionist congress in 1901, the pressure was on to found a number of cultural institutions and a resolution was adopted for a \\"fundamental survey of the question of founding a Jewish university.\\"Buber Martin, Berthold Feiwel and Chaim Weizmann: Bet Sefer Gavoa Yehudi: Geneva-Lausanne, 1902. A group of three young men in their twenties: Martin Buber of Vienna, student of philosophy and Zionist; Berthold Feiwel of Berlin ‚Äì political writer and editor and Chaim Weizmann ‚Äì formed a caucus emphasizing the need for a Jewish university with a first objective of education in technology. They produced a document pointing out the difficulties of Jewish youth who sought admission to universities where they lived. The lack of opportunities for technical studies, they wrote, was much more serious for Jewish students than in other studies. The problem was \\"eminiently economic and social\\". It meant that in Russia, the Jews were practically excluded from technical professions with the result that they were pushed into commercial occupations. The plan was to set up a preparatory Technikum, in part to train students for the university and in part to serve as an independent institution for the training of young people in technical, agricultural and similar professions. Graduates would be the basis for establishing and maintaining a Jewish industry.Zeev Sadmon: Die Gr√ºndung des Technions in Haifa im Lichte deutscher Politik, 1907‚Äì1920. Saur, M√ºnchen 1994, , p. 63‚Äì66. In 1903, 60,000 Jews of Palestine had just held elections for the first national democratic assembly, the grandfather of the present Knesset (Israel's parliament). It was called the Knessiah Rishonah (1st assembly). This gathering was special as a first grass-roots attempt to set up the structures of Jewish self-government. Zionist leader Dr. Menahem Ussishkin used the occasion to deliver a keynote address in which he expressed the urgency for an institution of higher education in Palestine. The convention supported a resolution for the establishment of a polytechnical institute in Palestine and the Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology (at least on paper) was born.Carl Alpert: Technion: the story of Israel's Institute of Technology. Paul Nathan of the Hilfsverein der deutschen Juden (\\"Relief Organization of German Jews\\"), played a central role in bringing together diverse Jewish groups under the Technikum umbrella, and in raising resources.Carl Alpert: Technion: the story of Israel's Institute of Technology. . p7 =First funds= Founder Jacob Schiff was determined to ensure that the Technion would maintain its independence The Russian tea merchant Kalonymous Zeev Wissotzky left all his holdings in the family business, approximately 1 million rubles, to philanthropic causes. Among the executors was Ahad Ha-Am,Ahad Ha-Am. Essays, Letters, Memoirs. Translated from Hebrew. Ed. Leon Simon. Oxford, 1946. the distinguished Zionist philosopher. Ahad Ha-Am was able to recruit Wissotsky's son David to the Technikum plan, and a first contribution of 100,000 rubles was made. In 1908, the American philanthropist Jacob Schiff was visiting the \\"holy land\\".Adler, Cyrus. Jacob H. Schiff: His Life and Letters.Vol. II. New York, 1929. Schiff was affected by the poverty and destitution he found among many of the Jews of Palestine and was inspired by the idea of an institution that would provide technical training. Back in Europe, interest in the new Technikum was kept high. In 1909 Dr. Chaim Weizmann, who would later become President of the State of Israel, reported to a Zionist conference in Manchester that things were going well with the \\"National Polytecnikum\\".Carl Alpert: Technion: the story of Israel's Institute of Technology. Chapter 2. Wealthy Jews from many lands were already promising generous support. =Choice of Haifa= A campaign was mounted by the Jewish community in Jerusalem to host the Technikum, and a special committee was set up to put forward a strong, Jerusalem case. The case for Haifa proved stronger, and in the end won the day:Carl Alpert: Technion: the story of Israel's Institute of Technology. p-13 * Haifa was destined to be the city of the future ... a great port center of industry and shipping. With the building of the Hedjaz railroad, it would be linked to Damascus and Baghdad and would become an important crossroads for land transport as well. * The local Jewish community was not yet rigid in its organization and character, unlike Jerusalem, the center of Orthodoxy; or Jaffa, which was a hotbed of Jewish nationalism. The neutrality of Haifa would minimize conflicts, they argued. * The local Jewish community was small, and its influence hardly felt in the city. The Technikum would give impetus to the expansion and growth of the Jewish population in the North. 1912: First cornerstone Flyer advocates the use of Hebrew. Architecture students at Technion (1920s). In October 1909, Prussian architect Alexander Baerwald was asked to come up with a first plan for the new building. This architect ‚Äì who used to play cello in a string quartet with Albert Einstein ‚Äì was inspired by the idea of blending European form with Eastern elements. His outstanding design was approved by the Kuratorium, and in August 1910, Baerwald was awarded the assignment to draw up the detailed plans and supervise the execution. Aside from the stone, most of the other building material came from abroad. The lime was from France, the cement from Germany. Plumbing installations and various fixtures also came from Europe and to this day, visitors at the historic building can read the German manufacturers‚Äô inscriptions on floor plates and elsewhere in the building. Digging of the well also created problems. First attempts could only reach 40 meters, at which point work was suspended due to a lack of skilled labor. A special permit to import the required dynamite was acquired, but it was only when a foreign expert was brought in that work on the well could finally be resumed and water was finally struck at 93 meters. The well was deepened to a 100 meters. The existence of a water source on the upper slopes of Mount Carmel would transform Haifa, becoming an elemental center for the sustenance of life for the following decades and for three invading armies. The well and its water would also become a vital source of income for the young, impoverished Technikum. In the year of the sinking of the Titanic, and a rare, total solar eclipse, the cornerstone of the new Technikum was finally laid. On April 11, 1912, 36 years before Israel declared independence, under the auspices of the occupying Ottoman Empire the local Jewish community turned out in full to witness the first physical implementation of a dream that had lasted for decades. =War of the languages= Construction of the Technion, 1912. An ongoing ideological conflict between the Hilfsverein ‚Äì a global educational organization led by Jews from Germany ‚Äì and the Zionist movement, escalated into an intense conflict over the planned language of instruction, known as the War of the Languages. Modern Hebrew was still in its infancy, and technical education was non-existent in the biblical tongue. A strong case was put forward for the Technikum to be run in German. A compromise of English was offered. Only the outcome of World War I and the diminished German influence in Palestine would finally resolve that Hebrew would be the official language of the Technion, and later the State of Israel.Carl Alpert: Technion: the story of Israel's Institute of Technology. Chapter two: The War of the Languages. =Albert Einstein and other supporters= Albert Einstein at Technion, c.1923. The development of technical and scientific opportunities for the Jewish people and at the new Technikum in Palestine in particular was an issue Prof. Albert Einstein felt worth his investment. \\"The development of Palestine is of real tremendous importance for all of Jewry,\\" he said at a testimonial dinner with the American Technion Society.At a 1940 testimonial dinner to Einstein, given by the friends of the Haifa Technion, Institute of Technology, quoted in Abraham Pais, Einstein Lived Here, Clarendon Press, Oxford U Press, 1994, pg 248 In 1923, Einstein visited the Technion. During his visit, he planted a now-famous first palm tree. The tree still stands today in front of the old Technion building in Hadar. Einstein returned to Germany to set up the first Technion Society, and served as its Chairman. He was later to tour America to raise funds for higher-education in Palestine,Einstein: A Centenary Volume, A. P. French, Harvard University Press (1979), p. 203 an issue he said he held \\"close to his heart\\". Einstein's motivation was not nationalistic, but humanistic. \\"I do what I can to help those in my tribe who are treated so badly everywhere,\\" he said.Ronald W Clark, Einstein: The Life and Times, p. 383, William Morrow, =First classes= Technion students in the main lobby (1930s). Arthur Blok, an electrical engineer, was the school's first President, assuming the position in 1924 until 1925. The Technion enrolled its first students in 1924, and its official opening ceremony took place in 1925. Its first class had 17 students, including one woman, who majored in civil engineering and architecture. Blok was succeeded as president by civil engineer Max Hecker (1925‚Äì27), Shmuel Pewsner (1927‚Äì29), Aharon Tcherniavsky (1927‚Äì29), and Joseph Breuer (1930‚Äì31). World War II Technion 1937 Technion 1945 Refugees from the Holocaust arriving in Haifa. Shlomo Kaplansky was the President of the university from 1931 to 1950. In the 1930s, the Institute absorbed large numbers of Jewish students and distinguished scholars from Poland, Germany, and Austria, who were fleeing the Nazi regime. In the midst of immense financial difficulties, Technion staff voted to work temporarily without pay to ensure the Technion's economic survival. In 1934, the Faculty of Industrial Technology was established covering broad fields. By the late 1930s the demand for technical university graduates had increased, and many Technion students volunteered to fight with the British against the Third Reich. Enrollment exceeded 400 students, and the University had expanded to include a degree in industrial engineering, 11 labs, and a nautical school. In time, fields of study taught at the Faculty of Industrial Technology were made into independent faculties. In the years preceding the establishment of the State, Technion was an active center for the Jewish underground ‚Äì notably the Hagannah ‚Äì and a source of technological defense solutions crucial to the struggle for independence. Israel independence Yaakov Dori first Chief of the General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces and 7th president of the Techion Technion National Stamp, 1956. In 1948, with a student body of 680, Technion celebrated Israel's Declaration of Independence. The developing state created new demands on the veteran university. To meet these needs, Technion launched a variety of ambitious projects. In 1948, the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering were set up. The Department of Aeronautical Engineering was established in 1949, and it claims to have laid the foundation for Israel's successful aerospace industries and Air Force. Rapid expansion and a new campus Yaakov Dori, formerly the first Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces, was President of the university from 1951 to 1965. By 1951, undergraduate enrollment had grown to 966 students. As the original campus in central Haifa had become too small, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion selected a 300-acre site on Mount Carmel for a new campus. In 1953, the Institute began its move to Technion City on Mount Carmel. In the 1950s the following Faculties were founded: *Department of Aeronautical Engineering (1953) (renamed Faculty of Aerospace Engineering); *Faculty of Agricultural Engineering (1953); *Faculty of Chemical Engineering (1954); *Faculty of Chemistry (1958); *General Studies (1958) (renamed Department of Humanities and Arts); *Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management (1958). Decades of war and peace During the 1960s, the Technion opened its doors to hundreds of students from the developing countries of Africa and Asia. Scores of Technion faculty members provided technological assistance to various countries worldwide, often under the auspices of United Nations agencies. Recognizing the growing trend in interdisciplinary activity, Technion established several new departments, including Biomedical Engineering, Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, and the Solid State Institute. Alexander Goldberg, a chemical engineer, was President of the university from 1965 to 1973. In 1969, Technion established the Faculty of Medicine, one of the few medical schools worldwide to be affiliated with an institute of technology. The 1970s in Israel were marked by extremes ‚Äì from the trauma and tragedy of the Yom Kippur War to the optimism and hope of Israel's peace agreement with Egypt. Throughout the upheaval and change, Technion remained at the forefront of the nation's activities ‚Äì from producing technologies for guaranteeing Israel's future security, to planning cooperative regional research projects in subjects such as desalination and nuclear energy. The establishment of the Samuel Neaman Institute for Advanced Studies in Science and Technology at the Technion in 1978 further encouraged the interaction of academia, industry and government. In 1971 the Faculty of Biology was established. Amos Horev, an Israeli Defense Forces Major-General and nuclear scientist, was President of the university from 1973 to 1982. The birth of Israeli high tech In the 1980s, Technion-based research and its high number of graduates is said to have paved the way for the rapid expansion of Israel's high-tech industries. From the birth of fiber optics and the development of optoelectronics, Technion graduates were seen to be at the local forefront of technological innovation of the time. Josef Singer, an aeronautical engineer, was President of the university from 1982 to 1986, and Max Reis, a chemical engineer, from 1986 to 1990. In the early 1990s, massive immigration from the former Soviet Union boosted the student population from 9,000 to 10,500. As well as absorbing a significant flow of high quality scientists and engineers from the former Soviet Union, Technion established technological incubator companies and structures to ensure that the new talent could be put to use. Zehev Tadmor, a chemical engineer, was President of the university from 1990 to 1998. Multidisciplinary centers of excellence were established, ties with industry were strengthened, new academic programs were developed, and a massive campus expansion program was launched, including construction of The Henry and Marilyn Taub and Family Science and Technology Center, which houses the western world's largest computer science faculty. In 1998, Technion's Asher Space Research Institute (ASRI) successfully launched the \\"Gurwin TechSat II\\" microsatellite, making Technion one of five universities with a student program that designs, builds, and launches its own satellite. Amos Lapidot, the tenth Commander of the Israeli Air Force, was President of the university from 1998 to 2001, and Yitzhak Apeloig, a pioneer in the computational chemistry field, from 2001 to 2009. In 2007, the Technion's historic role in technology transfer in Israel was streamlined globally with the launch of its T3 Technion Technology Transfer office. Peretz Lavie, an expert in the psychophysiology of sleep and sleep disorders, was President of the university from 2009 to 2019. Technion has an active multidisciplinary center in Energy Research, to strengthen Israel as the globe reaches peak oil. It also has campus-wide programs in Nanotechnology and Science, and Life Science and Engineering. Uri Sivan, a physicist, has been President of the university since 2019. First Nobel prizes in science In 2004, two Technion scientists became the first Israelis to bring home the Nobel Prize in Science. Avram Hershko, Aaron Ciechanover ‚Äì together with colleague Irwin Rose ‚Äì unraveled how the cell functions as a highly efficient checking station where proteins are built up and broken down. The degradation is not indiscriminate but takes place through a process that is controlled in detail so that the proteins to be broken down at any given moment are given a molecular label. The labelled proteins are then fed into the cells' \\"waste disposers\\", or proteasomes, where they are chopped into small pieces and destroyed. The label consists of a molecule called ubiquitin. This fastens to the protein to be destroyed, accompanies it to the proteasome where it is recognised as the key in a lock, and signals that a protein is on the way for disassembly. Shortly before the protein is squeezed into the proteasome, its ubiquitin label is disconnected for re-use. Examples of processes governed by ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation are cell division, DNA repair, quality control of newly produced proteins, and important parts of the immune defence. In 2011, the Nobel Prize for chemistry was awarded to Prof. Dan Shechtman, for his discovery of quasiperiodic crystals, or \\"Shechtmanite\\".

It is an omnivore that feeds on land, but returns regularly to the water, and can survive short periods of drought in burrows and under stones. Its natural range stretches from north-eastern Greece, around both sides of the Black Sea and to beyond the Caspian Sea; populations have also been introduced to southern France. It is included as a near threatened species on the IUCN Red List, and is included in the Red Data Book for Ukraine. It belongs to the genus Potamon. Description P. ibericum differs from other species in the genus in the form of the first pleopod of the males ‚Äì the organ used to transfer spermatophores. In P. ibericum, the flexible zone of this appendage is widest near the middle, rather than V-shaped (as in P. fluviatile and P. rhodium) or bilobed (as in P. potamios). Ecology and behaviour P. ibericum is an omnivore. The continued survival of P. ibericum generally requires a permanent body of water, although the crabs can survive short periods of drought by retreating under stones, or into deep burrows. These burrows may be several kilometres from the nearest body of water. They only breed in moving water, with copulation occurring in the warmer months, from June to October. P. ibericum is an omnivore, eating detritus, filamentous algae, and plant matter, as well as a variety of animals, including worms, amphipod crustaceans, aquatic insect larvae, molluscs, frogs and tadpoles, fish, and carrion. It feeds on land during the night, and if the air is humid enough, also during the day. In the areas where it occurs, P. ibericum is a major food item for the European otter, Lutra lutra, alongside a variety of fish species. Distribution The H√©rault River near Saint-Guilhem-le-D√©sert houses an introduced population of P. ibericum. The natural range of P. ibericum is wide, but highly fragmented. In Europe, it is present in the Danube and its tributaries in Bulgaria, as well as rivers in North Macedonia, north-eastern Greece (east of the Axios River), Cyprus and the European part of Turkey, and around the coast of the Black Sea through Ukraine to the Caucasus. Despite the specific epithet ', the species does not occur on the Iberian Peninsula, which has no native freshwater crabs, but to Caucasian Iberia. The Asian part of its range extends across Turkey to Iran and Turkmenistan. Some sites that formerly held populations of P. ibericum have been subject to occasional desiccation, and the crab populations have been reduced or extirpated. The northern limit of the species, like that of its western relative, P. fluviatile is close to the January isotherm. P. ibericum was introduced to the Cagne River in southern France between 1975 and 1983, when crayfish of the species Astacus leptodactylus were imported for aquaculture from Turkey. It is now found some downstream of that site, at the entrance to a series of gorges, in a part of the river that rarely dries out. A second population was discovered in the 1990s, from the Cagne site, in the H√©rault River near Saint-Guilhem-le-D√©sert. Neither population is considered invasive. Another species of Potamon ‚Äì P. fluviatile ‚Äì has also been introduced to France, in the vicinity of Nice. Fossil crabs assigned to the species \\"P. antiquum\\" have been discovered in sediments of Pliocene‚ÄìPleistocene age in northern Hungary. That species was previously thought to represent the ancestor of several extant species, including P. fluviatile and P. ibericum, but its young age and geographical location suggests that \\"P. antiquum\\" may represent specimens of P. ibericum from former populations beyond the species' current northern limit. Fossils assigned to P. ibericum from Vallesian sediments at Richardhof in the Vienna Basin suggest that the crabs in those sediments were predators of an extinct snail in the genus Melanopsis. Conservation Despite its wide geographical range, P. ibericum is classified as near threatened on the IUCN Red List, as \\"it is possible that populations of P. ibericum in parts of its range might be in danger of extirpation in the future, especially those on islands or near centres of human population on the mainland\\". It may even approach a classification of vulnerable. The species is listed in the Red Data Book for the Ukraine.

They show direct development and maternal care of a small number of offspring, in contrast to marine crabs, which release thousands of planktonic larvae. This limits the dispersal abilities of freshwater crabs, so they tend to be endemic to small areas. As a result, a large proportion are threatened with extinction. Systematics More than 1,300 described species of freshwater crabs are known, out of a total of 6,700 species of crabs across all environments. The total number of species of freshwater crabs, including undescribed species, is thought to be up to 65% higher, potentially up to 2,155 species, although most of the additional species are currently unknown to science. They belong to eight families, each with a limited distribution, although various crabs from other families are also able to tolerate freshwater conditions (euryhaline) or are secondarily adapted to fresh water. The phylogenetic relationships between these families is still a matter of debate, so how many times the freshwater lifestyle has evolved among the true crabs is unknown. The eight families are: ;Superfamily Trichodactyloidea *Trichodactylidae (Central America and South America) ;Superfamily Potamoidea: *Potamidae (Mediterranean Basin and Asia) *Potamonautidae (Africa, including Madagascar) *Deckeniidae (East Africa and Seychelles) ‚Äì also treated as part of Potamonautidae *Platythelphusidae (East Africa) ‚Äì also treated as part of Potamonautidae ;Superfamily Gecarcinucoidea *Gecarcinucidae (Asia) *Parathelphusidae (Asia and Australasia) ‚Äì nowadays treated as a junior synonym of Gecarcinucidae ;Superfamily Pseudothelphusoidea: *Pseudothelphusidae (Central America and South America) The fossil record of freshwater organisms is typically poor, so few fossils of freshwater crabs have been found. The oldest is Tanzanonautes tuerkayi, from the Oligocene of East Africa, and the evolution of freshwater crabs is likely to postdate the break-up of the supercontinent Gondwana. Members of the family Aeglidae and Clibanarius fonticola are also restricted to fresh water, but these \\"crab- like\\" crustaceans are members of the infraorder Anomura (true crabs are Brachyura). Description and lifecycle Eggs of alt=Seven round translucent spheres: inside some of them, a pair of compound eyes can be seen. The external morphology of freshwater crabs varies very little, so the form of the gonopod (first abdominal appendage, modified for insemination) is of critical importance for classification. Development of freshwater crabs is characteristically direct, where the eggs hatch as juveniles, with the larval stages passing within the egg. The broods comprise only a few hundred eggs (compared to hundreds of thousands for marine crabs), each of which is quite large, at a diameter around . The colonisation of fresh water has required crabs to alter their water balance; freshwater crabs can reabsorb salt from their urine, and have various adaptations to reduce the loss of water. In addition to their gills, freshwater crabs have a \\"pseudolung\\" in their gill chamber that allows them to breathe in air. These developments have preadapted freshwater crabs for terrestrial living, although freshwater crabs need to return to water periodically to excrete ammonia. Ecology and conservation Freshwater crabs are found throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. They live in a wide range of water bodies, from fast-flowing rivers to swamps, as well as in tree boles or caves. They are primarily nocturnal, emerging to feed at night; most are omnivores, although a small number are specialist predators, such as Platythelphusa armata from Lake Tanganyika, which feeds almost entirely on snails. Some species provide important food sources for various vertebrates. A number of freshwater crabs (for example species from the genus Nanhaipotamon) are secondary hosts of flukes in the genus Paragonimus, which causes paragonimiasis in humans. The majority of species are narrow endemics, occurring in only a small geographical area. This is at least partly attributable to their poor dispersal abilities and low fecundity, and to habitat fragmentation caused by the world's human population. In West Africa, species that live in savannas have wider ranges than species from the rainforest; in East Africa, species from the mountains have restricted distributions, while lowland species are more widespread. Every species of freshwater crab described so far has been assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature; of the species for which data are available, 32% are threatened with extinction. For instance, all but one of Sri Lanka's 50 freshwater crab species are endemic to that country, and more than half are critically endangered.

He is currently unemployed after last playing for Egyptian League club Al Ittihad. Club career Chuka popularly called is a Nigerian local name Chuka. He is a professional football player who started his career in Al Salam Fc Oman. He played one season in Oman and became the joint top scorer in the Oman league, scoring 12 goals in 2008/2009 season. In February 2010 he took a giant step in his career, making a free transfer to a top club in Qatar, Umm Salal Fc. At that time Umm Salal was just celebrating their massive achievement, being the first Qatar club to reach Asian Champions league Quarter finals. It was the French top coach Gilla Gilli that spotted the teenager in Oman and brought him to Qatar. Few months later, the club parted ways with the French Coach and eventually brought one of the top coaches in the world, [Hen Ten Cate]. It was Henk Ten Cate who gave the young Ogbu his debut, both in the league games and in Qatar Cup. The Teenager didn't disappoint the manager, scoring an important goal on his debut, a goal that later took the club to knockout stage of the Bin Khalifa Cup. The coach kept his confidence and trust on the teenager making him the starter of the Emir Bin Khalifa Cup Finals with 55,000 fans from both clubs. High profile attendance were the ruler of Qatar Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani, Brazilian President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva, popularly known as Lulu and manay other dignitaries around the world. After one and half seasons in Qatar, with 5goals in his senior games, he left Qatar and went to trial at PSV Eindhoven during the 2011/2012 pre-season on the recommendation of then Umm Salal manager Henk ten Cate. However, he did not sign for them because of the financial situation of Eindhoven and also more complication as he comes from outside EU, but Fred Rutten, the coach of PSV, described him as \\"very fast and interesting player, with good character and a hard shot\\". On 10 August 2011, he signed for Oud- Heverlee Leuven Ogbu became the love of the fans in Leuven, the fans love him and he love the club. The instantly became the club hitman and their valuable asset. Ogbu was once quoted, i love when the fans signs with me name, it gives me extra adrenaline to fight for the fans. After two amazing seasons in Leuven scoring 18goals, of which 7 of those 18 goals are almighty important goals for the club history. After two years in the top flight in Jupiler league Belgium, Ogbu decided its time to move on to another challenges. Ogbu made a transfer of 500,000 euros to Romanian Giant CFR Cluj. Due to the financial instability at the club, players were not paid for months, Ogbu managed to score 6goals in Romania, before a massive offer came from liaoning Whom Fc China. An offer of 1.2million dollar was made for the player, both the club and the player accepted the offer. Ogbu played his first and only Europa league game for the Romanian Giant before moving to China on 23 July 2014. It didn't take his time to adjust to Chinese football as Ogbu score twice on his debut in China first league against Shenzhen. He went on to write his name in Chinese Super League history, scoring 16 goals in Liaoning FC before moving to Japan Ventforest Kofu. He played less than a season with the Japan top league, making 11 appearances with only one goal. Things didn't go well for the player in Japan, he decided to move back to Europe, landing a deal with DVSC Debrecen. Injuries and potential transfer sage with the club didn't allow the player to settle in Debrecen. ]. Chuka transferred to Chinese Super League side Liaoning Whowin on 25 July 2014.

H. Fei and Gustav Ranis and can be understood as an extension of the Lewis model. It is also known as the Surplus Labor model. It recognizes the presence of a dual economy comprising both the modern and the primitive sector and takes the economic situation of unemployment and underemployment of resources into account, unlike many other growth models that consider underdeveloped countries to be homogenous in nature. According to this theory, the primitive sector consists of the existing agricultural sector in the economy, and the modern sector is the rapidly emerging but small industrial sector. Both the sectors co-exist in the economy, wherein lies the crux of the development problem. Development can be brought about only by a complete shift in the focal point of progress from the agricultural to the industrial economy, such that there is augmentation of industrial output. This is done by transfer of labor from the agricultural sector to the industrial one, showing that underdeveloped countries do not suffer from constraints of labor supply. At the same time, growth in the agricultural sector must not be negligible and its output should be sufficient to support the whole economy with food and raw materials. Like in the Harrod‚ÄìDomar model, saving and investment become the driving forces when it comes to economic development of underdeveloped countries.  Basics of the model  Depiction of Phase1, Phase2 and Phase3 of the dual economy model using average output. One of the biggest drawbacks of the Lewis model was the undermining of the role of agriculture in boosting the growth of the industrial sector. In addition to that, he did not acknowledge that the increase in productivity of labor should take place prior to the labor shift between the two sectors. However, these two ideas were taken into account in the Fei‚ÄìRanis dual economy model of three growth stages. They further argue that the model lacks in the proper application of concentrated analysis to the change that takes place with agricultural development In Phase 1 of the Fei‚ÄìRanis model, the elasticity of the agricultural labor work-force is infinite and as a result, suffers from disguised unemployment. Also, the marginal product of labor is zero. This phase is similar to the Lewis model. In Phase 2 of the model, the agricultural sector sees a rise in productivity and this leads to increased industrial growth such that a base for the next phase is prepared. In Phase 2, agricultural surplus may exist as the increasing average product (AP), higher than the marginal product (MP) and not equal to the subsistence level of wages. Using the help of the figure on the left, we see that :: \\\\text{Phase 1}: AL (\\\\text{from figure}) = MP = 0 \\\\text{ and }AB (\\\\text{from figure}) = AP \\\\, According to Fei and Ranis, AD amount of labor (see figure) can be shifted from the agricultural sector without any fall in output. Hence, it represents surplus labor. \\\\text{Phase2}: AP > MP \\\\, After AD, MP begins to rise, and industrial labor rises from zero to a value equal to AD. AP of agricultural labor is shown by BYZ and we see that this curve falls downward after AD. This fall in AP can be attributed to the fact that as agricultural laborers shift to the industrial sector, the real wage of industrial laborers decreases due to shortage of food supply, since less laborers are now working in the food sector. The decrease in the real wage level decreases the level of profits, and the size of surplus that could have been re-invested for more industrialization. However, as long as surplus exists, growth rate can still be increased without a fall in the rate of industrialization. This re-investment of surplus can be graphically visualized as the shifting of MP curve outwards. In Phase2 the level of disguised unemployment is given by AK. This allows the agricultural sector to give up a part of its labor-force until :: MP = \\\\text{Real wages} = AB = \\\\text{Constant institutional wages (CIW)} \\\\, Phase 3 begins from the point of commercialization which is at K in the Figure. This is the point where the economy becomes completely commercialized in the absence of disguised unemployment. The supply curve of labor in Phase 3 is steeper and both the sectors start bidding equally for labor. :: \\\\text{Phase3}: \\\\text{MP} > \\\\text{CIW} \\\\, The amount of labor that is shifted and the time that this shifting takes depends upon: # The growth of surplus generated within the agricultural sector, and the growth of industrial capital stock dependent on the growth of industrial profits; # The nature of the industry's technical progress and its associated bias; # Growth rate of population. So, the three fundamental ideas used in this model are: # Agricultural growth and industrial growth are both equally important; # Agricultural growth and industrial growth are balanced; # Only if the rate at which labor is shifted from the agricultural to the industrial sector is greater than the rate of growth of population will the economy be able to lift itself up from the Malthusian population trap. This shifting of labor can take place by the landlords' investment activities and by the government's fiscal measures. However, the cost of shifting labor in terms of both private and social cost may be high, for example transportation cost or the cost of carrying out construction of buildings. In addition to that, per capita agricultural consumption can increase, or there can exist a wide gap between the wages of the urban and the rural people. These three occurrences- high cost, high consumption and high gap in wages, are called as leakages, and leakages prevent the creation of agricultural surplus. In fact, surplus generation might be prevented due to a backward-sloping supply curve of labor as well, which happens when high income-levels are not consumed. This would mean that the productivity of laborers with rise in income will not rise. However, the case of backward- sloping curves is mostly unpractical.  Connectivity between sectors  Fei and Ranis emphasized strongly on the industry-agriculture interdependency and said that a robust connectivity between the two would encourage and speedup development. If agricultural laborers look for industrial employment, and industrialists employ more workers by use of larger capital good stock and labor-intensive technology, this connectivity can work between the industrial and agricultural sector. Also, if the surplus owner invests in that section of industrial sector that is close to soil and is in known surroundings, he will most probably choose that productivity out of which future savings can be channelized. They took the example of Japan's dualistic economy in the 19th century and said that connectivity between the two sectors of Japan was heightened due to the presence of a decentralized rural industry which was often linked to urban production. According to them, economic progress is achieved in dualistic economies of underdeveloped countries through the work of a small number of entrepreneurs who have access to land and decision-making powers and use industrial capital and consumer goods for agricultural practices. = Agricultural sector = Land-Labor Production Function In (A), land is measured on the vertical axis, and labor on the horizontal axis. Ou and Ov represent two ridge lines, and the production contour lines are depicted by M, M1 and M2. The area enclosed by the ridge lines defines the region of factor substitutability, or the region where factors can easily be substituted. Let us understand the repercussions of this. If te amount of labor is the total labor in the agricultural sector, the intersection of the ridge line Ov with the production curve M1 at point s renders M1 perfectly horizontal below Ov. The horizontal behavior of the production line implies that outside the region of factor substitutability, output stops and labor becomes redundant once land is fixed and labor is increased. If Ot is the total land in the agricultural sector, ts amount of labor can be employed without it becoming redundant, and es represents the redundant agricultural labor force. This led Fei and Ranis to develop the concept of Labor Utilization Ratio, which they define as the units of labor that can be productively employed (without redundancy) per unit of land. In the left-side figure, labor utilization ratio :: R = \\\\frac{ts}{Ot} which is graphically equal to the inverted slope of the ridge line Ov. Fei and Ranis also built the concept of endowment ratio, which is a measure of the relative availability of the two factors of production. In the figure, if Ot represents agricultural land and tE represents agricultural labor, then the endowment ratio is given by :: S = \\\\frac{tE}{Ot} which is equal to the inverted slope of OE. The actual point of endowment is given by E. Finally, Fei and Ranis developed the concept of non-redundancy coefficient T which is measured by :: T = \\\\frac{ts}{te} These three concepts helped them in formulating a relationship between T, R and S. If ::T = \\\\frac{ts}{te}, then :: T = \\\\frac{ts/Ot}{te/Ot} = \\\\frac{R}{S}, \\\\text{ or }T = \\\\frac{R}{S} \\\\, This mathematical relation proves that the non- redundancy coefficient is directly proportional to labor utilization ratio and is inversely proportional to the endowment ratio. (B) displays the total physical productivity of labor (TPPL) curve. The curve increases at a decreasing rate, as more units of labor are added to a fixed amount of land. At point N, the curve shapes horizontally and this point N conforms to the point G in (C, which shows the marginal productivity of labor (MPPL) curve, and with point s on the ridge line Ov in (A). = Industrial sector = Capital-Labor Production Function Like in the agricultural sector, Fei and Ranis assume constant returns to scale in the industrial sector. However, the main factors of production are capital and labor. In the graph (A) right hand side, the production functions have been plotted taking labor on the horizontal axis and capital on the vertical axis. The expansion path of the industrial sector is given by the line OAoA1A2. As capital increases from Ko to K1 to K2 and labor increases from Lo to L1 and L2, the industrial output represented by the production contour Ao, A1 and A3 increases accordingly. According to this model, the prime labor supply source of the industrial sector is the agricultural sector, due to redundancy in the agricultural labor force. (B) shows the labor supply curve for the industrial sector S. PP2 represents the straight line part of the curve and is a measure of the redundant agricultural labor force on a graph with industrial labor force on the horizontal axis and output/real wage on the vertical axis. Due to the redundant agricultural labor force, the real wages remain constant but once the curve starts sloping upwards from point P2, the upward sloping indicates that additional labor would be supplied only with a corresponding rise in the real wages level. MPPL curves corresponding to their respective capital and labor levels have been drawn as Mo, M1, M2 and M3. When capital stock rises from Ko to K1, the marginal physical productivity of labor rises from Mo to M1. When capital stock is Ko, the MPPL curve cuts the labor supply curve at equilibrium point Po. At this point, the total real wage income is Wo and is represented by the shaded area POLoPo. Œª is the equilibrium profit and is represented by the shaded area qPPo. Since the laborers have extremely low income-levels, they barely save from that income and hence industrial profits (œÄo) become the prime source of investment funds in the industrial sector. :: K_t=K_o + S_o + \\\\Pi_o \\\\, Here, Kt gives the total supply of investment funds (given that rural savings are represented by So) Total industrial activity rises due to increase in the total supply of investment funds, leading to increased industrial employment.  Agricultural surplus  Agricultural surplus in general terms can be understood as the produce from agriculture which exceeds the needs of the society for which it is being produced, and may be exported or stored for future use. = Generation of agricultural surplus = Agricultural surplus in the dual economy of Fei and Ranis To understand the formation of agricultural surplus, we must refer to graph (B) of the agricultural sector. The figure on the left is a reproduced version of a section of the previous graph, with certain additions to better explain the concept of agricultural surplus. We first derive the average physical productivity of the total agricultural labor force (APPL). Fei and Ranis hypothesize that it is equal to the real wage and this hypothesis is known as the constant institutional wage hypothesis. It is also equal in value to the ratio of total agricultural output to the total agricultural population. Using this relation, we can obtain APPL = MP/OP. This is graphically equal to the slope of line OM, and is represented by the line WW in (C). Observe point Y, somewhere to the left of P on the graph. If a section of the redundant agricultural labor force (PQ) is removed from the total agricultural labor force (OP) and absorbed into the industrial sector, then the labor force remaining in the industrial sector is represented by the point Y. Now, the output produced by the remaining labor force is represented by YZ and the real income of this labor force is given by XY. The difference of the two terms yields the total agricultural surplus of the economy. It is important to understand that this surplus is produced by the reallocation of labor such that it is absorbed by the industrial sector. This can be seen as deployment of hidden rural savings for the expansion of the industrial sector. Hence, we can understand the contribution of the agricultural sector to the expansion of industrial sector by this allocation of redundant labor force and the agricultural surplus that results from it. = Agricultural surplus as wage fund = Integration of agricultural and industrial sectors to explain use of agricultural surplus as wage fund in a dual economy. Agricultural surplus plays a major role as a wage fund. Its importance can be better explained with the help of the graph on the right, which is an integration of the industrial sector graph with an inverted agricultural sector graph, such that the origin of the agricultural sector falls on the upper-right corner. This inversion of the origin changes the way the graph is now perceived. While the labor force values are read from the left of 0, the output values are read vertically downwards from O. The sole reason for this inversion is for the sake of convenience. The point of commercialization as explained before (See Section on Basics of the model) is observed at point R, where the tangent to the line ORX runs parallel to OX. Before a section of the redundant labor force is absorbed into the industrial sector, the entire labor OA is present in the agricultural sector. Once AG amount of labor force (say) is absorbed, it represented by OG' in the industrial sector, and the labor remaining in the agricultural sector is then OG. But how is the quantity of labor absorbed into the industrial sector determined? (A) shows the supply curve of labor SS' and several demand curves for labor df, d'f' and d\\"f\\". When the demand for labor is df, the intersection of the demand-supply curves gives the equilibrium employment point G'. Hence OG represents the amount of labor absorbed into the industrial sector. In that case, the labor remaining in the agricultural sector is OG. This OG amount of labor produces an output of GF, out of which GJ amount of labor is consumed by the agricultural sector and JF is the agricultural surplus for that level of employment. Simultaneously, the unproductive labor force from the agricultural sector turns productive once it is absorbed by the industrial sector, and produces an output of OG'Pd as shown in the graph, earning a total wage income of OG'PS. The agricultural surplus JF created is needed for consumption by the same workers who left for the industrial sector. Hence, agriculture successfully provides not only the manpower for production activities elsewhere, but also the wage fund required for the process. = Significance of agriculture in the Fei‚ÄìRanis model = The Lewis model is criticised on the grounds that it neglects agriculture. Fei‚ÄìRanis model goes a step beyond and states that agriculture has a very major role to play in the expansion of the industrial sector. In fact, it says that the rate of growth of the industrial sector depends on the amount of total agricultural surplus and on the amount of profits that are earned in the industrial sector. So, larger the amount of surplus and the amount of surplus put into productive investment and larger the amount of industrial profits earned, the larger will be the rate of growth of the industrial economy. As the model focuses on the shifting of the focal point of progress from the agricultural to the industrial sector, Fei and Ranis believe that the ideal shifting takes place when the investment funds from surplus and industrial profits are sufficiently large so as to purchase industrial capital goods like plants and machinery. These capital goods are needed for the creation of employment opportunities. Hence, the condition put by Fei and Ranis for a successful transformation is that Rate of increase of capital stock & rate of employment opportunities > Rate of population growth  The indispensability of labor reallocation  As an underdeveloped country goes through its development process, labor is reallocated from the agricultural to the industrial sector. More the rate of reallocation, faster is the growth of that economy. The economic rationale behind this idea of labor reallocation is that of faster economic development. The essence of labor reallocation lies in Engel's Law, which states that the proportion of income being spent on food decreases with increase in the income-level of an individual, even if there is a rise in the actual expenditure on food. For example, if 90 per cent of the entire population of the concerned economy is involved in agriculture, that leaves just 10 per cent of the population in the industrial sector. As the productivity of agriculture increases, it becomes possible for just 35 per cent of population to maintain a satisfactory food supply for the rest of the population. As a result, the industrial sector now has 65 per cent of the population under it. This is extremely desirable for the economy, as the growth of industrial goods is subject to the rate of per capita income, while the growth of agricultural goods is subject only to the rate of population growth, and so a bigger labor supply to the industrial sector would be welcome under the given conditions. In fact, this labor reallocation becomes necessary with time since consumers begin to want more of industrial goods than agricultural goods in relative terms. However, Fei and Ranis were quick to mention that the necessity of labor reallocation must be linked more to the need to produce more capital investment goods as opposed to the thought of industrial consumer goods following the discourse of Engel's Law. This is because the assumption that the demand for industrial goods is high seems unrealistic, since the real wage in the agricultural sector is extremely low and that hinders the demand for industrial goods. In addition to that, low and mostly constant wage rates will render the wage rates in the industrial sector low and constant. This implies that demand for industrial goods will not rise at a rate as suggested by the use of Engel's Law. Since the growth process will observes a slow-paced increase in the consumer purchasing power, the dualistic economies follow the path of natural austerity, which is characterized by more demand and hence importance of capital good industries as compared to consumer good ones. However, investment in capital goods comes with a long gestation period, which drives the private entrepreneurs away. This suggests that in order to enable growth, the government must step in and play a major role, especially in the initial few stages of growth. Additionally, the government also works on the social and economic overheads by the construction of roads, railways, bridges, educational institutions, health care facilities and so on.  Growth without development  Graph showing growth without development In the Fei-Ranis model, it is possible that as technological progress takes place and there is a shift to labor-saving production techniques, growth of the economy takes place with increase in profits but no economic development takes place. This can be explained well with the help of graph in this section. The graph displays two MPL lines plotted with real wage and MPL on the vertical axis and employment of labor on the horizontal axis. OW denotes the subsistence wage level, which is the minimum wage level at which a worker (and his family) would survive. The line WW' running parallel to the X-axis is considered to be infinitely elastics since supply of labor is assumed to be unlimited at the subsistence-wage level. The square area OWEN represents the wage bill and DWE represents the surplus or the profits collected. This surplus or profit can increase if the MPL curve changes. If the MPL curve changes from MPL1 to MPL2 due to a change in production technique, such that it becomes labor-saving or capital- intensive, then the surplus or profit collected would increase. This increase can be seen by comparing DWE with D1WE since D1WE since is greater in area compared to DWE. However, there is no new point of equilibrium and as E continues to be the point of equilibrium, there is no increase in the level of labor employment, or in wages for that matter. Hence, labor employment continues as ON and wages as OW. The only change that accompanies the change in production technique is the one in surplus or profits. This makes for a good example of a process of growth without development, since growth takes place with increase in profits but development is at a standstill since employment and wages of laborers remain the same.  Reactions to the model  Food-Leisure Graph Fei‚ÄìRanis model of economic growth has been criticized on multiple grounds, although if the model is accepted, then it will have a significant theoretical and policy implications on the underdeveloped countries' efforts towards development and on the persisting controversial statements regarding the balanced vs. unbalanced growth debate. * It has been asserted that Fei and Ranis did not have a clear understanding of the sluggish economic situation prevailing in the developing countries. If they had thoroughly scrutinized the existing nature and causes of it, they would have found that the existing agricultural backwardness was due to the institutional structure, primarily the system of feudalism that prevailed. * Fei and Ranis say, \\"It has been argued that money is not a simple substitute for physical capital in an aggregate production function. There are reasons to believe that the relationship between money and physical capital could be complementary to one another at some stage of economic development, to the extent that credit policies could play an important part in easing bottlenecks on the growth of agriculture and industry.\\" This indicates that in the process of development they neglect the role of money and prices. They fail to differ between wage labor and household labor, which is a significant distinction for evaluating prices of dualistic development in an underdeveloped economy. * Fei and Ranis assume that MPPL is zero during the early phases of economic development, which has been criticized by Harry T.Oshima and some others on the grounds that MPPL of labor is zero only if the agricultural population is very large, and if it is very large, some of that labor will shift to cities in search of jobs. In the short run, this section of labor that has shifted to the cities remains unemployed, but over the long run it is either absorbed by the informal sector, or it returns to the villages and attempts to bring more marginal land into cultivation. They have also neglected seasonal unemployment, which occurs due to seasonal change in labor demand and is not permanent. To understand this better, we refer to the graph in this section, which shows Food on the vertical axis and Leisure on the horizontal axis. OS represents the subsistence level of food consumption, or the minimum level of food consumed by agricultural labor that is necessary for their survival. I0 and I1 between the two commodities of food and leisure (of the agriculturists). The origin falls on G, such that OG represents maximum labor and labor input would be measured from the right to the left. The transformation curve SAG falls from A, which indicates that more leisure is being used to same units of land. At A, the marginal transformation between food and leisure and MPL = 0 and the indifference curve I0 is also tangent to the transformation curve at this point. This is the point of leisure satiation. Consider a case where a laborer shifts from the agricultural to the industrial sector. In that case, the land left behind would be divided between the remaining laborers and as a result, the transformation curve would shift from SAG to RTG. Like at point A, MPL at point T would be 0 and APL would continue to be the same as that at A (assuming constant returns to scale). If we consider MPL = 0 as the point where agriculturalists live on the subsistence level, then the curve RTG must be flat at point T in order to maintain the same level of output. However, that would imply leisure satiation or leisure as an inferior good, which are two extreme cases. It can be surmised then that under normal cases, the output would decline with shift of labor to industrial sector, although the per capita output would remain the same. This is because, a fall in the per capita output would mean fall in consumption in a way that it would be lesser than the subsistence level, and the level of labor input per head would either rise or fall. Berry and Soligo in their 1968 paper have criticized this model for its MPL=0 assumption, and for the assumption that the transfer of labor from the agricultural sector leaves the output in that sector unchanged in Phase 1. They show that the output changes, and may fall under various land tenure systems, unless the following situations arise: 1\\\\. Leisure falls under the inferior good category 2\\\\. Leisure satiation is present. 3\\\\. There is perfect substitutability between food and leisure, and the marginal rate of substitution is constant for all real income levels. Now if MPL>0 then leisure satiation option becomes invalid, and if MPL=0 then the option of food and leisure as perfect substitutes becomes invalid. Therefore, the only remaining viable option is leisure as an inferior good. * While mentioning the important role of high agricultural productivity and the creation of surplus for economic development, they have failed to mention the need for capital as well. Although it is important to create surplus, it is equally important to maintain it through technical progress, which is possible through capital accumulation, but the Fei-Ranis model considers only labor and output as factors of production. * The question of whether MPL = 0 is that of an empirical one. The underdeveloped countries mostly exhibit seasonality in food production, which suggests that especially during favorable climatic conditions, say that of harvesting or sowing, MPL would definitely be greater than zero. * Fei and Ranis assume a close model and hence there is no presence of foreign trade in the economy, which is very unrealistic as food or raw materials can not be imported. If we take the example of Japan again, the country imported cheap farm products from other countries and this made better the country's terms of trade. Later they relaxed the assumption and said that the presence of a foreign sector was allowed as long as it was a \\"facilitator\\" and not the main driving force. * The reluctant expansionary growth in the industrial sector of underdeveloped countries can be attributed to the lagging growth in the productivity of subsistence agriculture. This suggests that increase in surplus becomes more important a determinant as compared to re- investment of surplus, an idea that was utilized by Jorgenson in his 1961 model that centered around the necessity of surplus generation and surplus persistence. * Stagnation has not been taken into consideration, and no distinction is made between labor through family and labor through wages. There is also no explanation of the process of self-sustained growth, or of the investment function. There is complete negligence of terms of trade between agriculture and industry, foreign exchange, money and price.

History The history of the site can be traced to the Old Kingdom period of Egyptian history. A granite pillar of the Fifth dynasty pharaoh, Userkaf, is the oldest object found at El-Tod. It was this same pharaoh who ordered that the temple to Monthu be enlarged. Evidence of Eleventh dynasty building is shown in the discovery of blocks bearing the names of Mentuhotep II and Mentuhotep III. Under Senwosret I, these buildings were replaced with a new temple. Further additions to this temple were made under Ptolemy VIII. =Culture= Aside from Monthu, to whom a temple was dedicated, the Egyptian goddess Iunit was of local importance.

The climate is monsoonal; the average annual rainfall of over 1200 mm is the highest in the north-west Kimberley, sustaining the richest patches of rainforest in the region. Because it has not been stocked with cattle, which damage woodland habitats, riverine vegetation and alluvial flats, it carries relatively high densities of key bird species. Much of the country is rugged, constituted of King Leopold sandstones. The Mitchell Plateau is a bauxitic laterite plateau with Livistona palm forests.

Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 23/09/2011. =Threats= Threats to the area's biodiversity come from uncontrolled bushfires, feral animals (especially cats), and increasing numbers of wild cattle. Birds The site has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports the largest known population of the western subspecies of the partridge pigeon as well as chestnut rails, white-quilled rock-pigeons and rainbow pittas. It contains most of the world populations of black grasswrens and Kimberley honeyeaters. It also supports several species restricted to tropical savanna habitats, chestnut-backed buttonquails, varied lorikeets, northern rosellas, white- gaped, yellow-tinted, bar-breasted and banded honeyeaters, silver-crowned friarbirds, sandstone shrike-thrushes, white-browed robins, canary white-eyes, masked and long-tailed finches. Other animals The area is one of only two in Australia that retains a largely intact mammal fauna.

In the latter case, the court was prepared to go somewhat further, deciding that the foreign plaintiff's submission to the jurisdiction extended to a counterclaim which raised a new cause of action, provided that such a cross-claim was founded on or directly arose out of the same subject matter as that of the action. To similar effect, the English Court of Appeal in Republic of Liberia v Gulf Oceanic IncRepublic of Liberia v Gulf Oceanic (1985) 1 Lloyds Rep 539. concluded that a plaintiff submitted himself to the incidents of his litigation, including liability to a counterclaim properly brought. In that case the plaintiffs had sought a declaration in relation to a contract for the purchase of oil and a resulting arbitration. The defendant's counterclaim for damages for breach of the same contract and tort for wrongful procuring of the breach was permitted to stand, notwithstanding that the foreign defendants could not, in the absence of their own litigation, have been made amenable to the jurisdiction of the court on such an action.

He is one of the most controversial intellectuals in the Arab world because of his radical change from defending Salafism to defending atheism and rejecting organized religion. He questioned the existence of God and criticized religions, which resulted in the allegations of him becoming an atheist, therefore his books were banned all over the Arab world. After surviving assassination attempts in Egypt and Lebanon while suffering imprisonment under instigation from the Yemeni government, he was hospitalized at the Ain-Shams hospital in Cairo on December 12, 1995 and died of cancer on January 9, 1996. Biography =Education= Al-Qasemi was born in Buraydah in the Emirate of Nejd and Hasa (present-day Saudi Arabia). Al- Qasemi first joined the Sheikh Ali Mahmoud school, his father died in 1922, and al-Qasemi was then freed from the constraints imposed on him by his father, he then continued his studies. The merchant Abdulaziz Al-Rashed Al- Humaid was impressed by al-Qasemi, so he took him to Iraq, India and Syria, finally, Al-Qasemi resumed his studies at the Sheikh Amin Shanqeeti school in Zubair in Iraq after then he traveled to India where he spent two years learning in school, he learned Arabic, hadiths, and the foundations of the Islamic Sharia, he then returned to Iraq where he joined al-Kazimiyah school, he returned to Damascus, finally, he decided to live in Cairo. =al-Qasemi and Salafi philosophy= Al-Qasemi has studied at the Al-Azhar University in Cairo in 1927, but he was soon expelled because of his book \\"The chandelier in the sweep of the Dark Darkness\\" , which he had written in response to an article by Al-Azhar scholar Yusuf al-Degwy , entitled \\"The litigiousness and ignorance of Wahhabists\\" published in the Journal \\"Nour al-Islam\\" in 1931. Subsequently Abdullah al-Qasemi wrote several books attacking the scholars of Al-Azhar. =al-Qasemi and free philosophy= After this incident, al-Qasemi changed his way of thinking, defending secularism and scepticism and criticizing religion to the point where his opponents labelled him \\"atheist\\". His most important books - written after he turned against the Salafi ideology - are: \\"There are the cuffs \\" and \\"They lie to see God beautiful\\" and his book \\"Arabs are a sonorous phenomenon\\" (sic). He survived two assassination attempts in Egypt and Lebanon and suffered imprisonment in Egypt under instigation from the Yemeni government, because of his great influence on Yemeni students who, because of their frequent meetings with him, were deeply influenced by his thoughts. Such influence was perceived by the Yemeni government as negative and not suitable to Islam. =Death= He was hospitalized at the Ain-Shams hospital in Cairo on December 12, 1995 and died of cancer on 9 January 1996, and according to his will, he was buried along with his wife in the \\"Bab Al-Wazir\\" cemetery in Egypt. Works =Books= Abdullah Al-Qasemi's works have rarely been translated. Here is a non- exhaustive list: * The Universe Judges God () * The Pride of History in Crisis () * The Wahhabist Revolution () * The Universe's conscience () * These are the cuffs () * They lie in order to see god beautiful () * Arabs are a sonorous phenomenon () * Humans disobey to build Civilizations () =Quotes= * Men find their religions as they find their homelands, their lands, their homes and their fathers. They just find them, they do not search for them, do not understand them, do not choose them either. * Religions triumph in the battles they avoid, they don't fight against reason nor through reason. They never go in free fights against reason. And that is why they are triumphant. * Man does not want the knowledge that would hurt his will. He prefers to be silly but happy than intelligent and poor. * Whoever suicide with or without an idea, is nobler and more courageous than any martyr in any war. * We wanted, then imagined, we believed, and in the end, we were convinced. * Those who do not know how to smile finally institutionalize tears and call to consider this as an adoration. * What is the nature of the creator who forces his creatures to need misery, pollution, sadness. To be in the end a happy creature.

The film is based on Tom Rose's 1989 book Freeing the Whales, which covers Operation Breakthrough, the 1988 international effort to rescue gray whales trapped in ice near Point Barrow, Alaska. Plot Adam Carlson (John Krasinski), a news reporter in Point Barrow, a small town in northern Alaska, can‚Äôt wait to land a job in a bigger market in the lower 48 states. Then, in October 1988, the story of a lifetime practically gets dropped into his lap: while befriending local Inupiat boy Nathan (Ahmaogak Sweeney), a family of gray whales is discovered by them near the Arctic Circle, trapped by rapidly forming ice. Along with the descending media, including kindred spirit Jill Jerard (Kristen Bell), comes his ex- girlfriend Rachel Kramer (Drew Barrymore) ‚Äì a Greenpeace volunteer, and Pat Lafayette (Tim Blake Nelson), an Arctic Wildlife Refuge expert. Adam names the adult whales Fred and Wilma, and the infant Bamm-Bamm, and Rachel agrees to help Adam start a rescue campaign for the trapped whale family. Having been informed by Pat the whale family is trapped five miles inland, they realize they need icebreaker equipment to perform a successful rescue. Ruth McGraw (Kathy Baker), a secret Greenpeace activist, anonymously tips Rachel off that her husband Alaskan Northern Oil executive J.W. McGraw (Ted Danson) owns a hover barge that can pulverize a path through the ice. Having had a public and televised confrontation over bidding rights to the oil in Bristol Bay, Rachel and McGraw are all but at each other‚Äôs throats. But after being slyly informed by his wife how he would look if he became a tree hugger like Rachel, McGraw agrees to let ‚Äúthe witch‚Äù borrow his hover barge, and even agrees to pay for the fuel. Rachel has to resort to a potential PR scandal to prompt hard- hearted local Governor Haskell (Stephen Root) into joining the good-will effort, but Sarah Palin and the Joint Chiefs Of Staff need no such prompting. And once McGraw meets the whale family, he becomes fully committed as well, whereas before he was simply interested in securing a drilling contract. The National Guard - including Col. Scott Boyer (Dermot Mulroney), SAR Pilot Conrad (Shea Whigham), his copilot (Anthony Fryer) and General Stanton (Gregory Jbara) - are mobilized to begin the process of transporting the hover barge. Meanwhile, White House Representative Kelly Meyers (Vanessa Shaw), realizes what good PR the whale rescue would be for the administration, and gets the American president Ronald Regan (Jeff Bergman) involved in the effort. Being his representative, Kelly heads for Alaska, where she and Scott meet. While the hover barge is beginning its journey, however, the whales are running out of time, not only because their breathing hole is steadily growing smaller, but also because the local Inupiat whale hunting captains are considering harvesting them for food because they haven‚Äôt filled their quota, even though they don‚Äôt normally eat gray whales and traditionally hunt bowhead whales, which are capable of punching through the ice, whereas Fred, Wilma, and Bamm-Bamm are not. Having been warned through advice by Adam, the Inupiat leader and elder, Malik (John Pingayak) - who is Nathan‚Äôs grandfather - persuades them to instead volunteer keeping the breathing hole open by using chainsaws. Malik, a spiritual man in tune with nature, becomes aware that something is wrong with baby Bamm-Bamm, and Pat agrees with his assessment, diagnosing the calf as having come down with pneumonia because of the severe cold (negative 50 degrees Fahrenheit). Without hesitation, Rachel dons a special diving suit and goes into the water to examine Bamm-Bamm up close. It‚Äôs implied by Adam while he‚Äôs trying to stop her that her always-driving- forward attitude was why they broke up. Under the icy water, she finds a gill net wrapped around Bamm-Bamm‚Äôs fluke, and immediately cuts it off him, and he seems to perk up quite a bit after being freed. But he‚Äôs still sick, and needs his mother and father to help him get to the surface to breathe. Meanwhile, disaster strikes as the hover barge runs into an Arctic pothole even larger than the barge, and becomes no longer viable as an option to rescue the whale family. Scott is refusing to give up, however, and asks Kelly if the White House has a backup plan, to which she replies she was hoping he had one for them. Not only that, the ice is spreading faster than the volunteers can keep it back. But just as time is about to run out, two entrepreneurs from Minnesota, Dean Glowacki (Rob Riggle) and Karl Hootkin (James LeGros), provide de-icing machines that help keep the hole open and buy the three whales much- needed time. However, not only does the initial problem of cutting a five-mile path through half a foot of ice remain, at the place where the whales are supposed to go, scouts discover an additional problem of huge proportions: a thick wall of ice known as a pressure ridge that goes all the way to the sea floor and grows thicker with each passing hour. The several normally hostile factions - Inupiat, Greenpeace, the National Guard, the White House, and Alaskan Northern Oil - eventually learn respect and understanding from each other as they try to save the gray whales. So when it‚Äôs suggested to approach the Soviet Union - the only other ones who have an icebreaker barge nearby - for help, the initial response is an almost unanimous ‚ÄúNO WAY!‚Äù But much as they don‚Äôt want to admit it, they acknowledge they do need the Soviet Union‚Äôs help. So Captain Yuri Nikolvich (Stefan Kapiƒçiƒá) and his First Mate Dimitri (Mark Ivanir) are dispatched by Mikhail Gorbachev to aid in the rescue, officially making this an international effort. In anticipation of their arrival, breathing holes are cut every sixty feet all the way to the pressure ridge (425 total holes, 30 holes an hour cut in one day). Before the icebreaker ship arrives, however, little Bamm-Bamm succumbs to his illness and dies. Only then do Fred and Wilma swim to the pressure ridge. And everyone on both sides of the ocean are genuinely saddened by Bamm-Bamm‚Äôs death, and become determined to save Fred and Wilma, no matter what it takes. The enormous Soviet ice-breaker ship arrives to remove the last barrier before the whales die. The ship's first attempt doesn't work and leaves only a dent. The second attempt frightens the whales and they start swimming back the way they came, but the other breathing holes have frozen over and they‚Äôre running out of air. Risking their lives and their ship, the Soviets charge full-speed at the pressure ridge and succeed in punching a hole in it. The ice is finally broken and the adult whales Fred and Wilma escape the ice. The epilogue, narrated by Nathan, reveals that McGraw used his new reputation to uphold a contract to clean up the Exxon Valdez oil spill, Karl and Dean's de-icers made them local celebrities, Scott and Kelly got married, Jill worked her way up to a national news network, Greenpeace membership became more prominent, Adam confesses his love for Rachel and she returns his affections and they share a kiss, Adam decides to stay being a local news anchor, and both Nathan and Malik became closer to one another, and Nathan recalls about the hole in which the whales were first found and quotes \\"It kept getting bigger and bigger, until it let the whole world in.\\" In a post-credits scene, Fred and Wilma swim away free in the ocean.

The film's working title was Everybody Loves Whales, which is a line still heard in the film. Visual effects on Big Miracle were created by Rhythm and Hues Studios and Modus FX. Burger King promoted the movie with toys. The MPAA has rated this film PG for language. The red-and-black Soviet icebreaker in the movie is modeled after real world Arktika-class nuclear-powered icebreaker which is considerably larger than the diesel-electric icebreaker used in the actual rescue effort, the 1975-built Admiral Makarov. In shots which include live footage of the 2007-built 50 Let Pobedy, the blue-and-white polar bear logo of the former operator of the Russian nuclear icebreaker fleet, Murmansk Shipping Company, is clearly visible but the atom symbol on the hull as well as the name of the vessel has been airbrushed out. Reception On the aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a \\"Certified Fresh\\" rating of 75% positive reviews from 104 critics. The site's consensus was: \\"Big Miracle uses real-life events as the basis for a surprisingly satisfying family drama.\\" Metacritic currently holds a score of 61 based on 28 reviews.

It is spoken in most of Lower Carniola (southeast of Ljubljana) as far west as Cerknica and including the settlements of Grosuplje and Ribnica, and encompassing the area of the Eastern Lower Carniolan subdialect. Historically it was also spoken in Ljubljana because in the past the Ljubljana dialect displayed features more similar with the Lower Carniolan dialect group. However, it gradually grew closer to the Upper Carniola dialect group as a consequence of migration from Upper Carniola into Ljubljana in the 19th and 20th centuries. Ljubljana mostly expanded to the north, gradually incorporating many villages that were historically part of Upper Carniola, and so its dialect shifted closer to the Upper Carniolan dialects. Phonological and morphological characteristics The Lower Carniolan dialect generally has a pitch accent. It is characterized by extensive ei, ie, and uo diphthongs developed from long vowels as well as an a-colored semivowel. The change o > u (ukanje) occurs in the dialect, as well as some degree of akanye. There is a high degree of syncope, vowel mutation caused by soft consonants, final short accented syllables, a short infinitive, and relatively well-preserved quantitative differences between long and short syllables.

The area is approximately above sea level, and (vertical distance) away from the sea. The area is surrounded by two of the most important bays in Gozo; the Dwejra Bay to the northwest, and the Xlendi Bay to the southeast. The area is situated on layers of Upper, Middle and Lower Globigerina limestone (), which make up the base of the whole San Raflu area. However, one also finds traces of Coralline limestone rock, which also makes up the Xlendi Cliffs. The high amount of limestone in the area also influences the soil, which is mainly xerorendzinas, a main characteristic of the Globigerina areas. In fact, this soil is a compound of the Globigerina limestone, the greensand, and several other organic material, and has very high levels of stone and chalk content, whilst keeping a very low level of humus. This type of soil is mostly common in the southern parts of Gozo, but however, it is still considered widespread around the island.  History  The area has always been a centre for agricultural activity, which has grown in the 20th century. The area is called San Raflu or Sarraflu most probably after the archangel Raphael, although the reason for this is unknown. The area centers around a man made hole which gathers water and is home to several different marine organisms. Since 1981, a spring festival, called the Fiera tal-Gƒßadira (Gƒßadira Festival) is held every year on the first Sunday after Easter, and in which several agricultural produce and farm animals are sold to the public. However, in general, one may conclude that the area has always been quite slow and quiet, perhaps with the exception of the quarrying industry, which for some years has been present in the area, and which is still active presently.  Biodiversity  = Flora = The area boasts of a diversity of flora and fauna throughout the year, making it an ecological place of high importance. This is because the soil is quite fertile, and that there are several patches of land which are left unused, and therefore it is very easy for wildlife to regenerate and grow. The species, especially the plants vary also in their type, as we find indigenous, endemic, and also alien or introduced species, as depicted in the table below. Out of nine common species found in the area, four are indigenous, two are endemic, and two are introduced. This is the most clear proof of the flora diversity, and its importance not only in Gozo, but also in the Maltese Islands in general. One should also note that the Sicilian Marigold is only found in Gozo in the San Raflu and Xlendi Areas, along with some other area in Malta. This increases the ecological importance of the area in respect of the flora. = Fauna = Although rich in flora and plant species, the San Raflu Area does not prosper in fauna diversity, chiefly due to the human impact on the area. However, one may conclude there are mainly fresh water forms of life, such as ducks, turtles, fish, and frogs. Ducks have been present in the area since the man-made depressions were first created. However, the species were most probably introduced through human interference, and not by natural means. This theory is supported by the fact the species found in the pond are always changing, hinting out that persons could have introduced them there. Amongst the species there are the Garganey, the Eurasian Wigeon and the Northern Pintail. Although some say that the presence of goldfish was reported in the pond, there has certainly been an introduction of an alien species of fish, the Gambusia Holbrooki, also known as the Eastern Mosquitofish. This species has been definitely introduced in the area, as it is most commonly found in the Americas and Australia, where they were introduced to decrease the mosquito population. Originally, the Maltese native frog (Discoglossus pictus) inhabited the pond, but today an alien species almost completely ruined and replaced it. This is the Rana Bedriagae or Bedriaga's Frog which, according to sources was introduced by human means in the late 1990s and which managed to establish a permanent population in the San Raflu Area. Today, this species has been classified as one with a potential danger to the Maltese frog.  Human interference  = Farming industry = Farming has always been present in the area, due to the high fertility of the soil. Farmers have not done much changes to the area, but surely contributed in enriching the soil and maintaining it in place through the use of the ƒ¶itan tas-Sejjieƒß (rubble walls) and special trees also intended to prevent soil erosion. From what one can notice, the farming techniques used in the area are on the whole more primitive in respect of other agricultural area, and this may very positive, as contamination of the soil is being avoided. = Quarrying industry = Certainly, the quarrying industry is the most active in the area, with workers depending on it on a daily basis. Apart from this, it's also the one which has most interfered with the natural landscape of the area, as it was responsible for the demolition of stretches of garigue and agricultural land. Therefore, the quarry contributed heavily in increasing the levels of soil erosion and dispersal in the area, whilst also ruining the natural landscape and environment. = Hunting = Hunting was a popular and uncontrolled activity till the late 1900s. However, with the enforcement of new laws and regulations this activity has decreased exponentially. The interference however has surprisingly increased, with hunting turrets and bird trapping cages causing a sudden blockage for the fauna and the flora, even causing them to stop growing in certain areas. The damage to the flora was also conducted through the planting of an alien breed of Eucalyptus trees, which are used to attract birds, and which are damaging the local plants and trees. The use of herbicides has also damaged the soil extensively.

Set a generation after the events of the Avatar films, the area is based upon the fictional exoplanetary moon, Pandora, and features Pandora's floating mountains, alien wildlife, and bioluminescent plants. Spanning , Pandora ‚Äì The World of Avatar includes two major attractions, Avatar Flight of Passage and Na'vi River Journey, as well as retail and dining outlets. Disney began development on Pandora ‚Äì The World of Avatar in 2011, jointly with Cameron and his production company, Lightstorm Entertainment, with the intention of transforming Animal Kingdom into a full- day operation, complete with added attraction capacity and nighttime experiences. Construction on the area began on January 10, 2014, and the land opened to the public on May 27, 2017. History  = Development = left In early 2011, James Cameron was approached by Disney executives Bob Iger and Tom Staggs, CEO and then-COO respectively, regarding the possibility of Avatar- themed attractions at Disney Parks properties. Originally, discussions were held about creating an Avatar-themed attraction at Disney's Hollywood Studios, perhaps at the park's then-functioning Studio Backlot Tour. Staggs suggested incorporating the film into a newly designed \\"land\\" at Disney's Animal Kingdom to improve the park's attraction roster. Cameron was initially surprised at Disney's approach in scope, commenting that \\"Disney‚Äôs vision when they came to me was to create a land. I thought we were going to be talking about creating an attraction.\\" On September 17, 2011, Disney entered into an exclusive, long- term licensing agreement with Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment and 20th Century Fox for the worldwide theme park rights to Avatar; Disney agreed to pay Cameron and Fox a licensing fee and a percentage of merchandise sales. The deal was officially announced to the public on September 20, 2011. The highlight of the announcement was that Disney's Animal Kingdom would receive a new themed area entirely devoted to Avatar. While no specifics were announced, the new area was described as being several acres in size and costing an estimated $400 million to build, a scale similar to Cars Land at Disney California Adventure in California. The area was later estimated to cost approximately $500 million. Disney showcased a first look presentation of the land in October 2013 at the Japan D23 Expo. Construction began in January 2014, with an initially planned opening date in 2016. The deal could see Avatar attractions added to other Disney theme parks in the future‚ÄîDisneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland are also in consideration‚Äîhowever, there are no immediate plans to do so. The opening date was later revised to summer 2017. In February 2017, the official opening day was confirmed to be May 27, 2017. The land received a dedication ceremony on May 24, 2017 with Iger, Cameron, Jon Landau, Fox chairman Stacey Snider, and cast members Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, and Sigourney Weaver, attending the dedication. To promote the park's opening, ABC aired a series of special episodes of The View live from the park, including a special pre-opening preview featuring James Cameron, as well as a live episode on the park's opening day festivities, which included guests Sherri Shepherd, John Stamos, Ariel Winter, Eric Stonestreet, Audra McDonald, Mandy Moore, Tom Bergeron, and chefs Masaharu Morimoto and Art Smith, with musical performances by Andy Grammer and Train. =Design= Pandora ‚Äì The World of Avatar is designed by Walt Disney Imagineering and Lightstorm Entertainment with Avatar producers James Cameron and Jon Landau acting as creative consultants. Imagineer Joe Rohde, creative executive of Disney's Animal Kingdom, served as creative director for the project. The area was constructed in the former location of Camp Minnie-Mickey, which was originally earmarked for the Beastly Kingdom, a never-built themed land which would have been based around mythological creatures. Instead of including characters or basing the land on existing plotlines from the films, the team emphasized issues such as conservation and environmental stewardship. Project manager Tim Warzecha described the land as a standalone experience from the films, focusing on \\"all about the people, the environment, the culture, the animals and the beauty of the world.\\" Rhode cited the film's themes and environmental message as compatible to the park's established values. Rohde said: \\"If you think about the intrinsic value of nature, transformation through adventure, and personal call to action ‚Äî these are the values of Animal Kingdom. But if you say them again, those are the themes of the film Avatar. So Avatar and Animal Kingdom will nest into each other very, very neatly.\\" Disney and Lightstorm decided to set the land's timeline a generation after the warring conflict between the indigenous Na'vi and the Resources Development Administration (RDA) that sought to exploit Pandora for its unobtanium in the first film. According to the backstory, the Na'vi and humans have achieved peace and Alpha Centauri Expeditions (ACE)‚Äìa fictional tourism company‚Äìhas partnered with the Na'vi to present Pandora as a new destination for ecotourism and scientific research. As a result, ACE established the Pandora Conservation Initiative to preserve and study the native Pandoran species. In September 2011, Cameron confirmed that a flying attraction featuring \\"3-D projections and creature designs that were cut from the original film\\" was a concept on the drawing board for the area. Pandora ‚Äì The World of Avatar includes elements from the original Avatar film as well as its four, yet-to- be-released sequels. Rhode initially admitted difficulty in adapting the locations depicted in Avatar to the physical realm, as Pandora is portrayed in the films solely through computer-generated imagery. Therefore, Imagineering adapted the concept art and digital designs from the films and expanded upon it, with Rhode explaining that \\"there was not enough detail in those images for an actual place that you're really going to build.\\" The distinct nighttime bioluminescence of Pandora is created through a combination of LED floodlights, fiber optics, and blacklight effects. A major visual feature of Pandora is the Valley of Mo'ara and its floating mountain ranges. The -tall mountains employ forced perspective to appear larger than they physically are, and are held aloft by steel beams concealed with rockwork and vinery. Designers were sent to Zhangjiajie National Forest Park to study the jagged pillar peaks of the Wulingyuan region for inspiration, as well as foliage studies in Hawaii. The steel foundations for the floating mountains required a year to complete. Pandora's bioluminescent species of flora are also found throughout the area. Imagineers created twenty species of Pandoran flora exclusively for the land. The landscaping consists of real Earth plant species mixed with sculpted Pandora flora, with each alien plant requiring its own concealed control box to create the necessary amount of illumination in bioluminesce during the evening hours. New motion sensor technology developed by Disney Research, allows the plant life to respond to tactile interaction from guests. Audio recordings of Pandoran animals create ambient noise throughout the land. Unlike other themed lands and attractions in the company's history, Disney omitted traditional theme park attributes throughout Pandora ‚Äì The World of Avatar‚Äîsuch as attraction marquees, Disney-branded merchandise, and Mickey Mouse images on the MyMagic+ scanners found in Fastpass lines‚Äîas a way of maintaining the natural theming of the land. The parks' cast members play ACE field experts. The area features music composed by James Horner and Simon Franglen based on the original score from Avatar, which was originally composed by Horner and arranged by Franglen. A soundtrack compilation album of Pandora ‚Äì The World of Avatar was released by Walt Disney Records on January 4, 2019, containing complete ride-through music for Avatar Flight of Passage and Na'vi River Journey, atmospheric area sounds, and ambient music composed for the Windtraders Shop, Pongu Pongu and Sa'tuli Canteen. The music was recorded at Abbey Road Studios and Air Studios in London. Sandra Benton provided the vocals for the Shaman of Songs in Na'vi River Journey.

The source system is usually crippled as a result, perhaps only temporarily, in order to allow the recipient device to function properly again. Cannibalization is usually due to unavailability of spare parts, due to an emergency, long resupply times, physical distance, or insufficient planning or budget. Cannibalization can also be due to surplus inventory. At the end of World War II a large quantity of high quality, but unusable war surplus equipment such as radar devices made a ready source of parts to build radio equipment. In the electronics market, machines being cannibalized are known as parts machines. Diminishing manufacturing sources The Royal Navy aircraft carrier moored in the Hamoaze; in 1972 the ship was decommissioned from active service, but retained to serve as a source of spares for . Sometimes, removing parts from old equipment is the only way to obtain spare parts, either because they are no longer made, are obsolete, or can only be manufactured in large quantities. In logistics, this is known as Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS). Department of Defense regulation 4140.1-R, DoD Supply Chain Management Regulation This is often the case in the military, and ships and aircraft, as well as other expensive equipment that is produced in limited quantities. Such was the case with the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk, the sole survivor of a class of three ships built during the early-1960s. The ship herself is over forty years old, and having manufacturers build individual custom replacement parts would be highly impractical, and thus decommissioned ships, such as the USS Independence, have been utilized for the necessary parts to keep the Kitty Hawk in operation. Another example is the Union Pacific's 4-8-4 locomotive 838 is used as a spare parts source for 844 since the type has been out of production for decades and its builder no longer exists. One strategy used to combat DMS is to buy additional inventory during the production run of a system or part, in quantities sufficient to cover the expected number of failures. This strategy is known as a lifetime buy.Proceedings of the 2007 Aging Aircraft Conference Lifetime Buy Optimization to Minimize Lifecycle Cost, Dan Feng, Pameet Singh, Peter Sandborn, CALCE, Department of Mechanical Engineering University of Maryland See also * Aircraft boneyard * Knockdown aircraft * Wrecking yard References *UK Aircraft Parts Cannibalization - Regulatory Article (RA) 4812 Category:Maintenance Category:Scarcity de:Kannibalisierung#Technik it:Cannibalizzazione#Trasporti nl:Kannibalisatie#Techniek ","title":"Cannibalization (parts)"},{"id":"33183994","text":"Elachista contaminatella is a moth of the family Elachistidae that is found from France, Austria and Slovakia to the Iberian Peninsula, Sardinia and Sicily.

The experiment studied neutrino oscillations along the CNGS beam from CERN to the LNGS Gran Sasso Laboratory. On 31 May 2010 Ereditato announced the detection of the first tau-neutrino by OPERA. This was the first indication of the direct appearance of neutrino oscillations. In September 2011 the OPERA Collaboration announced that an anomaly was detected in the measurement of the neutrino velocity, pointing to the possibility of superluminal muon neutrinos. The source of the anomaly was then found by the OPERA researchers as due to an instrumental problem. As head of the ATLAS Bern group, Ereditato contributed to the discovery of the Higgs Boson in 2012.http://inspirehep.net/record/1124337 In the framework of the T2K experiment in Japan, in 2013 he took part in the discovery of the appearance of neutrino oscillations and with the OPERA collaboration he shared the discovery of tau-neutrino appearance. For these results Ereditato was one of the recipients of the 2016 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics. He is currently involved in the USA neutrino program, notably with the MicroBooNE and SBND experiments at Fermilab aimed at the search for sterile neutrinos. He has been one of the founders of the DUNE experiment for the high precision study of neutrino oscillations and astroparticle physics. Ereditato's group is contributing to the realization of the Near Detector of the experiment with the so-called ArgonCube liquid argon time projection chamber.

Description In e-commerce, some companies intentionally cannibalize their retail sales through lower prices on their online product offerings. More consumers than usual may buy the discounted products, especially if they'd previously been anchored to the retail prices. Even though their in-store sales might decline, the company may see overall gains. Another example of cannibalization occurs when a retailer discounts a particular product. The tendency of consumers is to buy the discounted product rather than competing products with higher prices. When the promotion event is over and prices return to normal, however, the effect will tend to disappear. This temporary change in consumer behavior can be described as cannibalization, though scholars do not normally use the phrase \\"cannibalization\\" to denote such a phenomenon. In project evaluation, the estimated profit generated from the new product must be reduced by the earnings on the lost sales. Another common case of cannibalization is when companies, particularly retail companies, open sites too close to each other, in effect, competing for the same customers. The potential for cannibalization is often discussed when considering companies with many outlets in an area, such as Starbucks or McDonald's. Cannibalization is an important issue in marketing strategy when an organization aims to carry out brand extension. Normally, when a brand extension is carried out from one sub-category (e.g. Marlboro) to another sub-category (e.g. Marlboro Light), there is an eventuality of a part of the former's sales being taken away by the latter. However, if the strategic intent of such an extension is to capture a larger market of a different market segment notwithstanding the potential loss of sales in an existing segment, the move to launch the new product can be termed as \\"cannibalization strategy\\". In India, where the passenger-car segment is going up dramatically since the turn of this century, Maruti-Suzuki's launch of Suzuki Alto in the same sub-category as Maruti 800, which was the leader of the small-car segment to counter the competition from Hyundai is seen to be a classic case of cannibalization strategy. A company engaging in corporate cannibalism is effectively competing against itself. There are two main reasons companies do this. Firstly, the company wants to increase its market share and is taking a gamble that introducing the new product will harm other competitors more than the company itself. Secondly, the company may believe that the new product will sell better than the first, or will sell to a different sort of buyer. For example, a company may manufacture cars, and later begin manufacturing trucks. While both products appeal to the same general market (drivers) one may fit an individual's needs better than the other. However, corporate cannibalism often has negative effects: the car manufacturer's customer base may begin buying trucks instead of cars, resulting in good truck sales, but not increasing the company's market share. There may even be a decrease. This is also called market cannibalization. Finally, cannibalization is also referenced in the search engine optimization (SEO) industry; it is known as keyword cannibalization. Keyword cannibalization happens when multiple pages on a website specifically target the same content, to the point where the search engine has a difficult time determining which page is most relevant for the search query, and thus might not necessarily promote the page one would want website visitors to see most. Since the introduction of RankBrain into the algorithm during 2017, the issue of cannibal pages has become more prevalent, as Google is now using user interactions to decide what should rank highly (in addition to topical relevance), which has caused more fluctuation in the types of pages that rank for different types of queries. While this may seem inherently negative, in the context of a carefully planned strategy, it can be effective, by ultimately growing the market, or better meeting consumer demands. Cannibalization is a key consideration in product portfolio analysis. For example, when Apple introduced the iPad, it took sales away from the original Macintosh, but ultimately led to an expanded market for consumer computing hardware. Cost assessment To accurately determine the success of a new product it is important to understand the detriment its sales are having to older products in a company‚Äôs line up. The danger is the new products are taking from old products made by the business instead of increasing market share by taking consumers from competing products made by different businesses. A model was created in 2012 to gauge the change in sales. It is Sales change for focal new model (at time t) = \\\\+ change in demand for other models within same brand and category \\\\+ change in demand for other brands within category \\\\+ change in demand for other models within same brand in other categories \\\\+ change in demand for other brands in other categories \\\\+ primary demand (time is in weeks) (Van Heerde, Srinivasan, & Dekimpe, 2012). This model needs to try and deal with three problems with accurately estimating the success of a new product. Market volatility means many new products enter and leave the market making it harder to understand what specific product is affecting the market share. Slowness of the market to react to new products that have been introduced, meaning that there has to be time scope allowing for seasonal changes and the consumers to act accordingly. Correlated error structures may permeate the brand as not just one product will be effected so it is important to understand the scope of the commodity and see total impact. The model tries to mitigate these areas of error that make older models less reliable. There is also the danger of multiple distribution channel cannibalization which can lead to job insecurity and risk for the old channels as the new channels open. In the case of travel agencies; in the past nearly all travel groups relied on them as an intermediary for tourism, this meant face to face meetings to introduce the products or services that one group wishes to sell to the travelers. In recent years with new technology the necessity of travel agencies has been declining, with people being able to connect to the businesses they need to travel directly and cheaper than going through the more conventional means (Buhalis & Law, 2008). Airlines and similar tourism focused companies instead push through marketing the populace towards using their website instead of booking with a tourism agency, this is because it‚Äôs cheaper to run and can be more convenient for the consumer. So the update in technology has forced market cannibalization to cut the spending in certain business groups leading to job insecurity, decreased job satisfaction, job alienation and risk aversion (D√≠aza, Mart√≠n-Consuegraa, & Estebanc, 2015). Cannibalization is a necessary evil in lot of cases. As sales plateau and decline only to stabilize at a lower amount, it is important for business to innovate and experiment in order to create something new and cutting edge to maintain market share. Strategic development is important for business and integral for moving forward. Nitin Pangarkar said it is very important for businesses to maximize competitiveness with business strategy and cannibalization is part of this (Pangarkar, 2015). Cannibalization of markets is competing with others success and self- cannibalization is competing with yourself. As Steve Jobs said when he released the iPhone \\"If you don't cannibalize yourself, someone else will\\" (Isaacson, 2011). Even though there are dangers with cannibalization it has been very successful at pushing business innovation forward and identifying stagnant areas of a business. Risks The diversion of sales from one product to another or from the same product to a different product can adversely effect the overall sales of a business. Wendy Lomax theorized that using a brand name and leverage of current users of a brand to push them into using a new product can be a large risk (Lomax, 1996). This is due to the damaging nature which a failed product would have on the preexisting parent product. As sales dropped from the new product after it is no longer pushed there is no guarantee that sales will stabilize to the old product that was sacrificed for the current item. One of the unavoidable risks is to the established product but for self-cannibalization and growth this is essential. Apple cannibalized their own sales of the iPad when the iPhone 6 was released in September 2014 (Apple Corporation, 2014). According to a Forbes article, shipment of iPads was down 23% since the announcement of the iPhone 6. This is due to the new product (the iPhone) being large enough to have a lot of the features of the iPad without being as large making the iPad outdated and irrelevant (Marko, 2015). While the iPhone shipped massive amounts of product, the iPad never recovered to its previous sales plateau. Overall, this is a positive effect as turnover of new products allows company to get old users to spend money and keeps their products current which is very important in technology related fields. This is still an example of Apple betting sales of the old product to get higher sales on a new product in this case it was a success.

The aim of the project was to analyse the hypothesis of neutrino oscillation by directing a beam of neutrinos from CERN's facilities to the detector of the OPERA experiment at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS), located in the Gran Sasso mountain in Italy. The CNGS facility was housed in a tunnel which diverged from one of the SPS‚ÄìLHC transfer tunnels, at the Franco‚ÄìSwiss border near Geneva. It used the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) accelerator as a source of high-energy protons. History Approval for the CNGS project was signed by the CERN Council in December 1999, with civil engineering on the project starting the following September. Construction of the tunnels and service caverns was completed in mid-2004, with equipment installation completed in summer 2005 and commissioning being carried out throughout spring 2006. The first proton beam was sent to the target on 11 July 2006, with the CNGS facility being approved for physics operations on 18 August 2006. CNGS ceased operation in 2012. The tunnel was then repurposed for the AWAKE experiment, which became operational in 2016. Function A proton beam was taken from the SPS at and is made to collide with a graphite target within the CNGS tunnel. The resulting particles, most importantly kaons and pions among many other particles, were then focused by magnetic lensing and travelled down the CNGS tunnel in a vacuum tube. These particles are naturally unstable, and their decay products include muons and muon neutrinos. All particles except neutrinos (protons, muons, pion, kaon...) stop near the end of the tunnel. The neutrinos continue their flight unaffected, as they rarely interact with matter. The number of muons was measured at this point, which gave an indication of the beam's profile and intensity. This beam then passed through the crust of the Earth and it is expected that during flight some of the muon neutrinos convert into other neutrino types such as tau neutrinos. Once the beam arrived at Gran Sasso, the OPERA and ICARUS experiments were used to detect the neutrinos. Results The first candidates for neutrino oscillation to tau neutrinos were announced in May 2010 by the OPERA experiment. In total five tau neutrinos were observed, consistent with the expectations from the theory of neutrino oscillation. On 22 September 2011, the OPERA collaboration garnered international attention when they released a preprint reporting the Faster- than-light neutrino anomaly, wherein neutrinos were measured to be travelling, on average, at faster-than-light speed. On 24 February 2012, the team said they had discovered two problems with their previous test, muddying the validity of the previous result. The preprint has been modified to account for these facts, and indeed the measurement of the neutrino speed, there reported, agrees with the velocity of the light.

It was designed and built at the Rogo≈æarski factory in Belgrade. Design and development William Schuster, a flight engineer, designed the A≈ΩR at the end of 1929. The first test flight of the prototype was conducted by a factory test pilot on 5 November 1930. The aircraft was a biplane with the lower wing smaller than the upper. It was equipped with a seven-cylinder Walter Castor air-cooled radial engine of 240 hp and a wooden double-bladed propeller. The plane had dual controls, the two crew (pilot and flight instructor), sat one behind the other. It was to be employed as an intermediate trainer, replacing the outdated Hansa-Brandenburg C.I. The fuselage, which was of rectangular cross-section, was made of wood and covered with plywood. The wings had rounded ends, each was connected by a pair of metal struts and wire tensioners. Construction of the wing involved the use of wood covered with canvas. The landing gear was fixed and had no axle.–à–∞–Ω–∏—õ, –ß–µ–¥–æ–º–∏—Ä (–∞–ø—Ä–∏–ª 2000.) \\"–†–æ–≥–æ–∂–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏ –ê–ñ–†\\". –ê–µ—Ä–æ–º–∞–≥–∞–∑–∏–Ω 17: —Å—Ç—Ä. 34.

The aircraft was only used in 1931 for advertising purposes, demonstration flights and participation in air shows. It also competed in the King's Cup and the like; AZR still hoped to come to some arrangement with the military. This did not happen, Rogozarski withdrew from aircraft design, the prototype was registered as a civilian plane and used by the factory. It received the civil registration UN-PAU. In the meantime, the economic situation was such that the A≈ΩR was standing in its hangar, waiting for better days; despite bank loans, there was a distinct lack of orders and the company went bankrupt in 1933. Circumstances improved in the summer of 1934 when the Yugoslav Air Force bought the AZR and the fortunes of the factory improved, becoming a shareholder company.

He preferred to be called Abu al-Khattab, though at various times he was also referred to as Ibn al-Jumayyil, Majd al-Din, Abu al-Fadl or simply Ibn Dihya. Lineage Kalbi claimed paternal descent from a prominent companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and maternal descent from Muhammad himself. Kalbi's father traced his roots back to early Muslim diplomat Dihyah Kalbi, while his mother traced hers back to the third Caliph Ali through his son - and Muhammad's grandson - Hussein ibn Ali.Encyclopedia of Islam, vol. III, H-IRAM, pg. 747 Eds. Bernard Lewis, Charles Pellat and Joseph Schacht. Assist. J. Burton-Page, C. Dumont and V.L. Menage. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1971. Photomechanical print. From his mother Amat Allah, he traced his maternal bloodline through Abu Abdillah bin Abul-Bassam Musa bin Abdullah bin al- Hussein bin Ja'far bin Ali bin Muhammad bin Ali bin Musa bin Ja'far bin Muhammad bin Ali bin al-Hussein bin Ali bin Abi Talib; the attribution to the prophet Muhammad, at that point in the line, is also maternal as Ali was married to Muhammad's daughter Fatimah. Kalbi's lineage was not universally accepted. While biographer Ibn Khallikan accepted the conventional telling of Kalbi's family line, historian Dhahabi disputed Kalbi's claim, making a counter claim that the latter's family tree could not be substantiated.Al- Dhahabi, Biography =Early life= While Ibn Diyha is generally acknowledged to have been born in Valencia, conflicting reports have been given regarding Kalbi's exact date of birth.F. de la Granja, Ibn Di·∏•ya. Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Brill Online, 2013. Reference. 9 January 2013 Ibn Khallikan held the view that Kalbi was born in March 1150, despite the fact that he was personally informed by Kalbi's son and nephew that Kalbi was born in February 1152. Kalbi initially pursued the study of Islamic Prophetic traditions in Spain, visiting every major city in the country and learning from their scholars and academics.Ibn Khallikan, pg. 385. In order to further his studies, he traveled from Al-Andalus to Marrakesh, Morocco. Later, his study of Prophetic traditions took him through to Tunis in the year 590AH, then through Africa and on to Egypt, the Levant, Baghdad, Erbil and Wasit in Iraq, and Isfahan and Nisapur in Greater Khorasan. Kalbi was a student of Ibn Ma·∏çƒÅ æ, chief judge of the Almohad Caliphate, and held immense respect for his teacher, who he referred to as \\"leader of all grammarians.\\"Encyclopedia of Islam, vol. III, H-IRAM, pg. 855. =Career= In addition to his renown as a linguistic scholar, Kalbi was also considered to be from the scholars of Prophetic narrations, which was actually his primary focus of study, despite his fame primarily being for his knowledge of Arabic grammar and philology.Al-Suyuti, Hasan al-Muhadharah bi Mahasin Masr wa al- Qahirah, volume 1, page 201 His number of students was considered high and his chain of narration is recognized by later scholars of the field. A number of these later scholars also narrated either directly from him or through his chain, such as Ibn al-Salah. While in Andalus, Kalbi was appointed as the judge of D√©nia by the Almohads, but stepped down after public reaction to his sentencing a convict to cruel and unusual punishment. After his resignation, he sought further education in the Muslim east. After studying Sahih Muslim in Tunis in 1198, he performed the Hajj at Mecca and spent some time in Egypt. He sought further knowledge in the field of hadith in Syria, Iraq, Persia as far east as Nisapur before returning to Egypt. Kalbi taught the Ayyubid Sultan Al- Kamil basic academic subjects and proper etiquette during the latter's youth. Later in life, Al-Kamil built an entire school for Kalbi to teach and pursue the study of Prophetic narrations. Al-Kamil would eventually replace Kalbi with his older brother Abu Amr bin Dihya al-Kalbi, also an expert in the Arabic language, as the director of the school, a position which the older brother held until his own death. =Death= Kalbi died in Cairo on Tuesday, the 14th of the Islamic calendar month Rabi' al-awwal, in the Hijri year 633, corresponding to November 1235. He was roughly 89 years old according to the Islamic calendar, and 86 years old according to the Gregorian calendar. His death was during Ayyubid rule in what is now Egypt. He was buried at the foot of the Mokattam mountain range outside of Cairo. His older brother, Abu Amr, died almost two years later in January 1237; he also died on a Tuesday, and was buried at the foot of the same mountain range. Evaluation of Kalbi's contribution to Islamic studies has been difficult due to his controversial nature among Muslim historians during the Middle Ages. Critics in the Muslim east have accused Kalbi of plagiarism and dishonesty, while those in the Muslim west praised Kalbi highly and referenced his education and efforts in learning. Works At the request Al-Kamil, he wrote his most famous work: \\"al-Motrib min Ashaar Ahl al-Maghrib\\" \\"\\" (loosely translated: Rhymes from the poetry of the people of the Maghreb) which was a collection of short biographies of the poets of Al-Andalus and Morocco, including their most famous poems. His work is extremely valuable as it preserved some of the oral traditions of the time as well as details of the poets' lives.

Around 1510 he entered the service of Cardinal Wolsey and became a Gentleman Usher to Henry VII. He was also a merchant importing caps and hats from the continent of Europe. By 1517 he was a wax chandler. In 1523 he took on an auditorship at court, and pursued a career as a financial officer.Stanley T. Bindoff, John S.

S-Bahn services operate on the section between Cologne and Bergisch Gladbach, which is electrified. The remaining section was never electrified and is now largely closed, although some of it is used for freight. The section between R√∂srath and Hoffnungsthal is now part of the K√∂ln-Kalk‚ÄìOverath railway. History = Cologne-M√ºlheim‚ÄìBergisch Gladbach‚ÄìBensberg section = The initial plans of 1863 were to build a line from M√ºlheim am Rhine (now K√∂ln-M√ºlheim station) to Bergisch Gladbach and on to Wipperf√ºrth. However, on December 1, 1868 the initial section was completed by the Bergisch-M√§rkische Railway Company to Bergisch Gladbach only. In 1870, the track was extended to Bensberg. This section was built as a double-track line. Trains continuing from Bergisch Gladbach needed to reverse in Bergisch Gladbach station. In 1912, a connecting curve was built in Bergisch Gladbach before the terminal station. A second station was built in Bergisch Gladbach as a through station. The second station was only used for passengers and passenger trains ran to it directly by the new curve. Freight trains ran to the terminal station, where there were several sidings connecting to surrounding factories. The Zanders paper mill was and still is connected to the curve from the freight yard to Bensberg, and not directly to the freight yard. Since the opening of the new terminal station in central Bergisch Gladbach in the early 1950s, passenger trains have run there. For this reason, the connecting curve is no longer used and it was dismantled in the early 1960s. Nevertheless, there have been plans for some time to restore it so that container trains from the zinc works container terminal can avoid reversing in the old freight yard. The terminal station in Bergisch Gladbach has only been used as a passenger station prior to 1912 and since September 1965. Between 1912 and 1950 it was operated exclusively as a freight yard. With the construction of the new station building in 1950, passenger trains ran again in the railway terminus, so that until 1965, two passenger stations existed: Bergisch Gladbach Stadtmitte (city centre) at the site of the old terminus station with the newly built station building and Bergisch Gladbach station, south of the railway triangle. The passenger service between Bergisch Gladbach and Bensberg was closed on September 29, 1965, which was also the end of operation to the southern station. Freight traffic between Bergisch Gladbach and Bensberg ended on May 27, 1989. In 1974-75, the S√ºlz Valley Railway was electrified for the Rhine-Sieg S-Bahn (now part of the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn), but not all tracks in Bergisch Gladbach station were electrified. In addition, the second track was restored between K√∂ln-M√ºlheim and K√∂ln-Dellbr√ºck; the second track had been removed between M√ºlheim and Bergisch Gladbach in 1945. In 2008, a new protected level crossing was built on the freight track at the roundabout next to the station. = Bensberg‚ÄìImmekeppel section = Crossing of Saaler Stra√üe in Bensberg Current end of the track at kilometer 13.8, just before the former Bensberg station Rail bridge at Lindlar In particular, the Gebr√ºder Reusch company in Hoffnungsthal, then a sheet metal manufacturer, and the Altenberg company (formally, the Rhein-Preu√üische Zink-, Gruben- und H√ºtten-Gesellschaft St. Paul de Sincay & Companie), which among other things operated a mine at L√ºderich near Hoffnungsthal, were very interested in links with the rail network. The line from Bensberg via Forsbach and R√∂srath to Hoffnungsthal was opened in 1890. The line from Hoffnungsthal to Immekeppel was opened in 1891. This was a single-track line. Initial attempts to establish a line through the S√ºlz Valley in 1873 failed, as the ministry rejected the new route. In 1883, a narrow gauge (metre gauge) railway was planned from Kalk via Rath, R√∂srath and Volberg to Immekeppel. The project ultimately failed because the Prussian Ministry of Public Works refused to provide the estimated funding required amounting to 830,000 marks. In 1937, a secret three kilometre branch line was built from near Bensberg station for the transport of ammunition to Ostheim air base. = Immekeppel‚ÄìLindlar section = The continuation of the line to Lindlar was mainly built to connect with the Lindlar quarry and mining operations, since their freight at that time had to be taken to Engelskirchen stations or Kaiserau on the narrow-gauge Leppe Valley Railway. In 1897, the council of the Lindlar municipality formed a committee that dealt with the proposed railway, but all attempts to establish a railway failed at first. It was not until 1906 that a standard gauge railway from Immekeppel to Lindlar was approved by the government, so that construction of the line started in 1909 and it was opened in 1912. The plan provided for four stations: Obersteeg, T√ºscher, Linde and Lindlar. There was controversy over the naming of T√ºscher station. Finally in 1911 the name was changed to Hommerich. The Immekeppel‚ÄìHommerich section was opened to traffic in January 1912 and the line from Hommerich to Lindlar was officially opened on December 9, 1912. Before the First World War, an extension of the line was planned via Hartegasse, Frielingsdorf and Dohrgauler to Wipperf√ºrth. This plan was never carried because of the outbreak of the war. Finally in 1927 the plan of the Lindlar‚ÄìWipperf√ºrth line was dropped in favour of a direct line from Bergisch Gladbach to Wipperfurth. But this line was also never built. Therefore, Lindlar station remained a \\"sack station,\\" which became less important and ultimately contributed to the closure of the line. By the late 1950s, a bus line was established along the railway. In 1960, the last passenger train ran between Hoffnungsthal and Lindlar, freight traffic and continued until 1966. In the same year the section was dismantled. Operations The line from Cologne-M√ºlheim to Bergisch Gladbach is operated on working days at 20-minute intervals and on weekends at 30-minute intervals as S-Bahn line S 11, using modern class 423 electric multiple units. Since the closure of the section of the S√ºlz Valley Railway between Bergisch Gladbach and Lindlar, the section between R√∂srath and Hoffnungsthal has operated as part of the Agger Valley Railway and is served by Oberbergische Bahn trains at 30-minute intervals. The line from Bergisch Gladbach station towards Bensberg to the zinc smelter is still open and on weekdays trains operate to the container terminal of H√§fen und G√ºterverkehr K√∂ln (Cologne port and rail freight) on Senefelderstra√üe.

to music. Paul was educated at Serangoon English School and St Andrew's School, passing his Senior Cambridge examinations in 1931. He studied arts subjects at Raffles College and graduated with a Diploma in the Arts in 1934. He joined the education service and taught at the Geylang English School, where he composed the music and lyric for what was to be the first school anthem, entitled the \\"Geylang English School Song\\". Paul is credited with championing and reviving classical music in Singapore during the 1940s and 1950s. He founded one of the country's first string ensembles. As an educator, he was the principal of Victoria School from 1959 to 1961 and the principal of Teacher's Training College from 1963 to 1968. He later taught in the music department of the National University of Singapore for decades. Paul Abisheganaden died on August 31, 2011, at National University Hospital in Singapore at the age of 97.

It is found in arid regions of South Australia, southern and eastern Northern Territory, western Queensland and western New South Wales. The species was first formally described by English botanist John Lindley in Thomas Mitchell's Three Expeditions into the interior of Eastern Australia in 1838. Lindley gave it the name Trichinium nobile Lindl. The species was transferred to the genus Ptilotus in 1868 by Victorian Government Botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in the sixth volume of his Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae. A 2007 molecular study of the ITS (internal transcribed spacer) nrDNA a few populations of P. nobilis var. nobilis and Ptilotus exaltatus var. exaltatus in Queensland found a very close relationship between the two using a neighbor-joining analysis. Ptilotus exaltatus var. exaltatus was subsequently synonymized together with P. nobilis var. nobilis under P. nobilis subsp. nobilis in a taxonomic paper by Tony Bean in 2008, citing this 2007 molecular study as \\"strong genetic evidence\\" (p. 241). A study by Hammer et al. in 2018 critically reevaluated all previous morphological concepts of P. exaltatus and P. nobilis (and all infrataxa previously included within each), and specifically the findings of the aforementioned studies in 2007 and 2008, and found that P. exaltatus var. exaltatus and P. nobilis var. nobilis were strongly partitioned in both morphology and ecology. This paper formally reinstated P. exaltatus as separate from P. nobilis subsp. nobilis and raised P. nobilis subsp. angustifolius and P. nobilis subsp. semilanatus to species as P. angustifolius (Benl) T.Hammer and P. semilanatus (Lindl.) F.Muell. ex J.M.Black, respectively. Scattered across inland New South Wales, it grows on a range of soils, though prefers more sandy than clayey soils. Habitats include Acacia woodland, mallee, shrubland and grassland. Cultivars (now of unclear taxonomic placement) developed and registered by Dion Harrison and colleagues at the University of Queensland include 'Passion' (an upright form with purple flowerheads), 'Poise' (a two-toned tan and pink flowerhead), and 'Purity' (upright stems and green-yellow flowerheads).

The Aarhus flows through the large river valley of Aarhus √Ödal. The valley itself stretches from Silkeborg to the coastal city of Aarhus, but the river only runs through the easternmost parts. Educational material about Aarhus √Ödal. The river drains a basin of in the eastern part of S√∏h√∏jlandet and discharges into the Bay of Aarhus which is an embayment of the Kattegat. It originates above sea level in the swampy bogland of Astrup Mose close to Stilling- Solbjerg Lake, southwest of the city of Aarhus (56¬∞6' northern latitude, 10¬∞9' eastern longitude) and exits into Aarhus Harbour at 56¬∞9' northern latitude, 10¬∞13' eastern longitude. The river defines the border between Skanderborg and Aarhus Municipality during its first few kilometres.  History  Aarhus River was important for the early development of Aarhus since the 8th century Aarhus River has been important for the development of the city of Aarhus since its foundation in the early Viking Age, and archaeological and historical research suggests that it played a crucial role in the origins of the city. There used to be a sizeable catch of eel, and to a lesser degree pike, in the Aarhus River up until the later part of the 20th century. Several families, often based at the rivers' watermills, made a living from it with the Brabrand Lake as the most productive fishing spot. As seen the world over, eel went into a rapid decline and with it the local fishing industry in the Aarhus River dried up. Through the 20th century, the river and its ecosystem went into a serious decline due to nutrient pollution from household wastewater and farmland run-off. Today, after some costly efforts to restore the damaging effects of the destructive eutrofication, the ecosystem and biodiversity of the Aarhus River is recovering and now includes a wide range of fish species once again. Two former fish farms along the Aarhus River at Pinds M√∏lle and Gammel Harlev has been re-purposed as put-and-take spots with trout for sports fishing.See \\"√Örhus √Ö\\" p. 39-48 With the advance of the automobile, the river's run through the city of Aarhus was paved over and covered by roads in the years 1930-1958. In the process, the last long stretch was named √Öboulevarden and created a new transport route to the thriving industrial harbour. In 1989, it was politically decided that Aarhus River should be opened again, and the project commenced in September 2005. In 2008, the reopened section of the river at √Öboulevarden was inaugurated, and work on the last section at the harbor front began, finishing in 2015.

Belonging to a family of artists, Nady began his career early on, steadily rising to become one of the best known comic artists in Egypt at a young age. He has drawn political cartoons since an early age, and since the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, has become increasingly active in this area of work, garnering a significant reputation for the boldness of his work. Biography =Background= Nady was born on December 31, 1981, into a family of artists. His father, Mohammad Nady, was a cartoonist and his mother, Iman Ezzat, is a sculptor and writer. In addition to his parents, Nady has cited his childhood and upbringing in the 10th of Ramadan CityThe \\"10th of Ramadan City\\" is like the 6th of October City. as an early influence in becoming an artist. As a child, he was an avid reader of comic books and magazines and he would occasionally create comics about his relatives, basing his characters on their features. Over time, this became a hobby with his father acting as mentor. He drew caricatures of schoolmates and teachers. Among his first comic characters was the \\"Amazing Mido\\" ( Mido al-'Ajeeb), a young inventor who was subjected to radiation that allowed him to easily control and change his shape and form. According to Nady, his first published cartoon was political. The cartoon was made during the Gulf War, while Nady was in elementary school, and it portrayed Sindbad hitting Saddam Hussein on the head, saying, \\"You've made the children of the world hate me now that they know I'm an Iraqi.\\" In 1992, at barely 11 years of age, he won his first award in a workshop at the Mahmoud Mukhtar Museum. The following year, he was given the best caricature award by a caricature magazine. =Career= Ahmad Nady began his professional career at the age of 14 when his father was suffering from fatigue and overwork. Nady asked him if he could draw for a Lebanese magazine and his father agreed and encouraged him. He started out at first as an assistant at a workshop producing Pharaonic sculptures, before working with a number of magazines, including Karma () company, known for several of its comics: Simsim's World ( The Egyptian version of Sesame Street), Sameer and Alaa el-Din () and the Young Arab (), among others. During this time, Nady started mailing several comic magazine editors with samples of his work and his ideas, all of which were rejected in Egypt. One of these, among his very first professional work, was a series of adventures called Fayek w Rayek () after its two main characters, a chimpanzee and a sloth. The series was published by the Saudi comic magazine Basme () and was popular among children. While steadily advancing as a comic artist, Nady began entering the realm of political cartoons. In 1996, he won third place in a UNESCO exhibition, \\"Where We Live\\", and in 2004, participated in an art exhibition organized by the Artists' Syndicate in solidarity with Palestine. He promoted comics and cartoons by setting up numerous workshops across Egypt, including at least one in the Bibliotheca Alexandrina. He has also won three awards from deviantArt, an online community of artists. Activism Nady participated in the 2008 Egyptian general strike and, for a time, in Mohamed ElBaradei's presidential campaign. Nady joined the 2011 revolution from the very beginning, participating politically at Tahrir Square and drawing cartoons on the spot, inviting those around him to suggest ideas and captions. He was one of the many people who camped out in Tahrir Square and was hit by a rubber bullet on January 28 during the violent clashes with the police. He also was attacked by members of the \\"Popular Committees\\" due to the propaganda by state owned media, which claimed that the protesters had a \\"foreign agenda\\". When asked about what should be done with National Democratic Party headquarters set on fire during the 2011 revolution, Nady praised the idea of turning the headquarters into a centre that holds cultural activities, saying, \\"It should be a place for workshops of all artistic fields inviting all artists from all over Egypt\\".

The name Kozenn was familiar to generations of former pupils in Austria-Hungary because Kozenn's school atlas was published in millions of copies in more than 100 editions and in many languages. It was one of the most commonly used atlases in the Austrian half of Austria- Hungary.Wolter, John Amadeus, Ronald E. Grim, & Library of Congress. 1997. Images of the world: the atlas through history. New York: McGraw-Hill, p. 253.  Life  Blasius Kozenn was born into a poor farming family in the village of Hotunje, not far from Ponikva. After attending elementary school in Ponikva, he attended the upper secondary school in Celje, where he was accepted through the efforts of his elementary school teacher. He continued his studies in Graz and Klagenfurt, where he studied theology. He was ordained a priest in 1845. Kozenn served as a curate in Rogatec from 1849 to 1850.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1976. Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 3. Ljubljana: Dr≈æavna zalo≈æba Slovenije. p. 388. From 1850 to 1852 he held the position of assistant instructor () at the Celje upper secondary school. After this he traveled to Vienna, where he studied mathematics, physics, and natural history at the University of Vienna, passing his teaching exams in these subjects with distinction. In 1854 he was accepted into the civil service and became an upper secondary school instructor, first in Ljubljana, and then from 1855 to 1858 in Gorizia. This was where he wrote his Grundz√ºge der Geographie f√ºr die 1. Classe der Mittel- und B√ºrgerschulen (Essentials of Geography for the First Class of High School; first published in 1858 in Budapest and Vienna) and his study Das Klima von G√∂rz (The Climate of the Province of Gorizia). In 1858 he started teaching at the German-language Imperial Upper Secondary School in Olomouc, where he remained until his early retirement in 1870. He was active in the introduction of the new Realschule secondary school, and in 1863 he was named a member of the school inspectorate. As a result of poor health, he moved from Olomouc to the Vienna suburb of Hernals, where he died from typhoid fever on 29 May 1871 at the age of 50.  School atlas  In Olomouc Kozenn became acquainted with the bookseller and publisher Eduard H√∂lzel, who convinced him to create the first Austrian school atlas. This was finally published in 1861, after H√∂lzel moved to Vienna. As sources for his maps, he used Adolf Stieler's and Heinrich Kiepert's German atlases. He did not shy away from directly copying and only slightly modifying German school atlases of the time. In 1900 Kozenn's atlas was fully revised by Vinzenz von Haardt, Friedrich Umlauft, Wilhelm Schmidt, and Franz Heiderich with regard to content, maps, and technical aspects; as such, it was comparable to the best atlases produced abroad. The success of H√∂lzel's publishing company encouraged the imperial government to issue other modern school atlases. Competition on the market resulted on the production of increasingly better atlases, including increasingly more thematic maps. The atlas was later revised further by Heinrich G√ºttenberger, Hermann Leiter, Hans Slanar, and Walter Strzygowski (after 1956). As a self-taught cartographer, Kozenn also produced numerous wall maps for schools.

He was a mainstay of the East Coast and Mid-Atlantic independent circuit for much of the 1990s and early 2000s. One of the most popular stars of Pittsburgh's Steel City Wrestling, he had successful stints in American Commonwealth Wrestling, Cueball Carmichael's Independent Pro Wrestling Alliance and Doug Flex's International Pro Wrestling as well; he also formed notable tag teams with Adam Flash, Axl Rotten, Brick Bronsky, Stevie Richards, Futureshock, and \\"Beef Stew\\" Lou Marconi winning the SCW Tag Team Championship with the latter three. In recent years, he has been affiliated with Marconi as part of his 216 Clique in NWA: East and in GOUGE Wrestling where he is currently holds the tag team championship as one-half of Bad Romance with Mickey Gambino. Professional wrestling career =Early career= A former amateur wrestler, Frank Stiletto made his pro debut in 1992. Calling himself the \\"most handsome man in professional wrestling\\", hence his nickname \\"Handsome Frank\\", Stiletto often claimed to be a look-alike for country music star Billy Ray Cyrus.\\"The PWI 500.\\" Pro Wrestling Illustrated. Fort Washington, Pennsylvania: London Publishing Company. (Holiday 1998): pg. 60. After nearly two years on the local independent circuit, he won his first major singles title in Mike Collins and Charlie Fulton's All-Star Wrestling Alliance by pinning then ASWA Light Heavyweight Champion Kid Collins at the ASWA supercard \\"Rumble On The River\\" in Belpre, Ohio, on August 12, 1994. He re-lost the title to Collins a month later at the Dallas Nightclub in Parkersburg, West Virginia. That same month, Stalletto also made his first appearance in the World Wrestling Federation, now known as WWE, as a preliminary wrestler. He wrestled Jim Neidhart at the Civic Center in Wheeling, West Virginia and, in front of 2,800 fans, Yokozuna at the Bradley Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; these matches later aired on WWF Superstars and WWF Wrestling Challenge respectively. =Steel City Wrestling (1994‚Äì1998)= The following month, Stiletto began wrestling for promoter Norm Connors in Steel City Wrestling where he would eventually become one of its top stars; he appeared on its first show against \\"Beef Stew\\" Lou Marconi in Connellsville, Pennsylvania on October 8, 1994. Two weeks earlier, he teamed with Futureshock as \\"Beauty & The Beast\\" to wrestle Marconi & Derek Stone in Munhall, Pennsylvania to determine the first SCW Tag Team Champions; the bout took place at a show for American Commonwealth Wrestling and the match was not billed as a title bout by the rival promotion. Despite their loss, Beauty & The Beast won the titles in Pittsburgh less than three months later. The team eventually lost the titles to Marconi and his new partner Black Cat, dubbed \\"Black & Blue\\", in Plum, Pennsylvania on March 17, 1995; the title changed hands in separate singles matches with Futureshock defeating Marconi but Stiletto losing to Black Cat. A month later, he faced Super Mario at SCW's annual Deaf Wrestlefest, a special fundraising event for the Western Pennsylvania School for the Deaf which also included independent wrestlers Demolition Ax, Lord Zoltan and T. Ranchula, World Championship Wrestling's Cactus Jack, and the World Wrestling Federation's Big Bully Busick, and would continue to perform at the shows over the next decade. The following month, he made an appearance for Al Snow's Global Wrestling Alliance to wrestle Osamu Nishimura, during his debut tour of the United States, in Kalamazoo, Michigan on May 19, 1995. In July 1995, he teamed with longtime rival Lou Marconi in All-Star Wrestling Alliance to win the promotion's tag team titles. Later that year, he enjoyed a brief partnership with Extreme Championship Wrestling's Stevie Richards and regained the SCW Tag Team titles from \\"Black & Blue\\" in Connellsville on October 21, however, he was attacked by Richards immediately after winning the belts. With the titles held up due to the team's breakup, Stiletto joined together with Lou Marconi to defeat Richards and Brian Rollins for the titles in St. Marys, Pennsylvania on November 11, 1995, a record third time. They dropped the titles back to Stevie Richards and The Blue Meanie\\"The PWI 500.\\" Pro Wrestling Illustrated. Fort Washington, Pennsylvania: London Publishing Company. (Winter 1996): pg. 46. at Deaf Wrestlefest 1996 on April 21, 1996. Over the summer, the two appeared on the August 25 edition of WWF Action Zone against The Smoking Gunns (Billy and Bart Gunn). In September 1996, he had a series of matches with Cody Michaels wrestling him in Buckhannon, West Virginia, Dover, Ohio and Mt. Washington, Pennsylvania on three consecutive nights; his second match with Michaels was an outdoor event held in the rain and attended by 4,800 fans. Stalletto and Marconi would continue battling the duo until the tag titles were declared vacant in January 1998 due to an injury suffered by Richards. Stiletto and Marconi made one last attempt to regain the titles but lost to Cactus Jack and The Blue Meanie in Irwin, Pennsylvania on February 8, 1998. =International Pro Wrestling (1996‚Äì1998)= While still in SCW, Stalletto also began feuding with Brick Bronsky in American Commonwealth Wrestling and International Pro Wrestling after Stiletto was attacked by Bronsky after being persuaded to tag with him. After Bronsky won the IPW Heavyweight Championship, Stiletto was among one of several independent wrestlers to challenge for the title. Despite losing the SCW Tag Team titles, Stiletto also continued to team with Lou Marconi wrestling in both Pennsylvania and Ohio, as well as becoming a top contender for the ACW Heavyweight Championship. As a singles wrestler, he continued to feud not only with Brick Bronsky in IPW\\"The PWI 500.\\" Pro Wrestling Illustrated. Fort Washington, Pennsylvania: London Publishing Company. (Holiday 1997): pg. 45. but also Johnny Graham and Julio Sanchez. He and Sanchez battled at the IPW Wrestlepalooza supercard on January 11, 1997 and, on February 14, made a one-time appearance for the Century Wrestling Alliance at The Sports Palace in New Britain, Connecticut which ended in a double-countout. He also wrestled WWF legend George Steele on the second episode of IPW Power Hour TV. Stalletto made a return to WWF television on April 7, 1997, wrestling Vader (with manager Paul Bearer) at John E. Worthen Arena in Muncie, Indiana; the match was aired live on WWF Monday Night Raw. He continued feuding with Julio Sanchez until leaving IPW later that year. Prior to returning independent circuit, Stalletto made two more appearances in the WWF for WWF Shotgun Saturday Night. On March 31, 1998, he and Roy Raymond wrestled L.O.D. 2000 (Hawk and Animal) (with Sunny) in Syracuse, New York and faced Vader once again at the Gund Arena in his hometown of Cleveland, Ohio; both shows were sold out. =Independent circuit (1998‚Äì2009)= Stalletto briefly returned to SCW in the summer of 1998. He was scheduled to team with Lord Zoltan against High Society (Cueball Carmichael & \\"Wiseguy\\" Jimmy Cicero) on August 28, 1998, however, he was unable to make the show. His partner attempted to take on both men by himself but the match ended in a disqualification. Two months later, he wrestled Cueball Carmichael on Steel City Wrestling TV. In December 1998, he wrestled Preston Steele (with Bobcat) at a TEAM L.A.W. show in Cleveland, Ohio. In early 1999, Stalletto started wrestling for Cueball Carmichael's Independent Pro Wrestling Alliance.\\"The PWI 500.\\" Pro Wrestling Illustrated. Fort Washington, Pennsylvania: London Publishing Company. (Holiday 1999): pg. 59. One of his earliest matches for the promotion was against Mark \\"the Shark\\" Shrader, a one-time MEWF Heavyweight Champion, in Woodbridge, Virginia on January 23, 1999; their match went for nearly 15 min. before Stalletto was pinned following a powerbomb off the top rope. Stalletto eventually reunited with his old tag team partner Lou Marconi in NWA: East and together \\"ran roughshod over the promotion\\" as one of its top stars during the mid-to late 1990s. Their partnership would form the basis of the heel stable \\"216 Clique\\" formed years later. The International Wrestling Cartel was another promotion which Stalletto visited. On January 25, 2003, he lost to T. Rantula in a \\"retro\\" match at Northgate High School in Bellevue, Pennsylvania. On March 6, 2003, Stalletto and Marconi headlined Cleveland Championship Wrestling debut show at the UAW Hall in Brook Park, Ohio. Stalletto made his NWA East return at its 14th Anniversary Show on September 20, 2008, with he and Lou Marconi teaming up against Lord Zoltan and a mystery partner in what was billed as a NWA East Throwback match. When Lord Zoltan resumed holding Deaf Wrestlefest for the Western Pennsylvania School for the Deaf in May 2009, he and Marconi were among those invited to participate. They were teamed with J.J. Dillon, making his first in-ring appearance since 1989, in a six-man tag team match against Dominic DeNucci, Cody Michaels and Shane Douglas (with Missy Hyatt). He and Marconi, this time teaming with Lord Zoltan, appeared in a special \\"Steel City Wrestling retro match\\" at IWC's A Call To Arms 2009: Full Circle supercard held in the Court Time Sports Center in Elizabeth, Pennsylvania where they lost to Shane Douglas and The Blue World Order (Da Blue Guy & Hollywood Nova). The event served as a retirement event for longtime promoter Norm Connors which was attended by a number of wrestlers including A.J. Styles and The Sandman among others. Both men were acknowledged by Conners in his farewell speech to the fans. On March 19, 2010, Stalletto and Marconi participated in Firestorm Pro Wrestling's 30-man intergender battle royal to crown the first \\"King of Cleveland\\". Other battle royal participants included Ares, J-Rocc, Shiima Xion, and M-Dogg 20. =GOUGE Wrestling and NWA East (2010‚Äì)= 2010 In early 2010, Stalletto began wrestling semi-regularly for Count Grog's GOUGE Wrestling (Gimmicks Only Underground Grappling Entertainment) in North Carolina following its May 15 supercard Cincon De Mayhem in Stem, North Carolina where pinned \\"Boogie Woogie Man\\" Rob McBride after using brass knuckles. A month later, Stalletto made a surprise return to NWA East as Lou Marconi announced the formation of a new \\"heel\\" stable, the 216 Clique, with his then recent proteges Dan Graham and Will Esquire at a house show on June 5. The group immediately began feuding with Mad Mike, and later, NWA East Three Rivers Champion Ryan Mitchell. At NWA East's July 16 supercard Summer Assault 4, held at Renzie Park in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, he and the rest of the 216 Clique (Lou Marconi, Frank Staletto, Will Esquire, and Dan Lennox) helped Lou Marconi defeat Mitchell in a gauntlet match to win the NWA East Three Rivers Championship. Stalletto formed a short-lived tag team with stablemate Dan Arkham but at Infection 3 on August 20, lost a three-way match to JB Destiny & Paul Atlas costing them a title shot the NWA East Tag Team Championship with the team breaking up shortly thereafter. He formed a more successful pairing with Shirley Doe with whom he scored a victory over Mad Mike & Ryan Mitchell the next month at No Limits 4. The match was originally scheduled as a singles match between Shirley Doe and Mad Mike, however, it turned into an impromptu tag team match when Mad Mike and Ryan Mitchell began attacking Doe and Stalletto came to help on his behalf. That same month at GOUGE's Too Hot to Handle, he lost Otto Schwanz. On October 9, at Dead Calm 4, he and Marconi lost to Stryder & Patrick Hayes allowing Stryder a shot at the NWA East \\"216\\" Title held by Marconi. In GOUGE, now teaming with Mickey Gambino as \\"Bad Romance\\", he and his new partner won the vacant GOUGE Tag Team Championship after defeating Jimmy Jack Funk, Jr. & Rob McBride in Youngsville, North Carolina at Maul-O-Ween on October 23; they also defeated McBride & Otto Schwanz at Raleigh's Rebus Gallery Works on Maul-O-Ween II a week later. Staletto and the 216 Clique continued feuding with Ryan Mitchell in NWA East. A six-man tag team match between the 216 Clique (Lou Marconi, Frank Staletto, and Dan Arkham) and Chris Taylor, Ryan Mitchell, & Jon Burton ended in a no- contest at Overdrive 2010 on November 6. A larger ten-man match pitting The 216 Clique (Frank Staletto, Kenny Hendrix, Dan Arkham, Chris Marx, & JJ DeVille) against Jon Burton, Patrick Hayes, Matt Barnett, & the Bunkhouse Boys (Bandit & Big Willie Blackheart) was two weeks later at Do Or Die 4 which Staletto's team won. Also that month, Stalletto defeated Chris Taylor at the Ohio Wrestling Alliance's November Nightmare in Defiance, Ohio. The last match of the year, saw The 216 Clique (Frank Staletto, Izzy Lambert, & Dan Graham) lose to Jon Burton & The Hansen Brothers (Crusher & Tony Hansen) at Christmas Chaos 4 on December 18, 2010. He was nominated by the promotion for \\"2010 Comeback of the Year\\" but lost out to fellow stablemate Lou Marconi. 2011 Managed by Count Grog, Bad Romance successfully defended the GOUGE Tag Team titles during the first half of 2011. The team beat Rob McBride & Robert Royal at Redneck Rumble in Wake Forest, North Carolina on January 8, and both the Krazy Killer Klowns and The Rat Pack (Jimmy Cicero & Brian Perry) in a Three-Way Dance at Winter Wars on February 19. Meanwhile, in NWA East, at February Fury 4, The 216 Clique (Frank Staletto & Dan Arkham) lost to The Hansen Brothers (Crusher & Tony Hansen). He and Arkham did, however, pick up a win at When Worlds Collide 4 over J-Ru & Travis Fame with the help of Shirley Doe and the Shirley Doe Experience (Jay Flash, Tony Johnson, and Apollyon). Earlier in the show, Stalletto and Marconi interfered in a match to help 216 Clique member \\"Notorious\\" Shane Taylor beat Stryder. At Crossfire 4, The 216 Clique (Frank Staletto, Dan Arkham, & Chris Marx) lost to The Beast & The Hansen Brothers (Tony & Crusher Hansen) via count-out. Later in the show, Stalletto lost to NWA East Heavyweight Champion Chris Taylor in a non-title match. A week later Stalletto and Mickey Gambino nearly lost the GOUGE Tag Team Championship to The Rat Pack at GOUGE's 5th Anniversary Show. The interference of Lou Marconi in the final moments of the match, however, allowed them to retain the titles despite the team's disqualification. After the match, North Carolina Heavyweight Champion Vordell Walker ran into the ring on behalf of The Rat Pack causing a brawl between all six men. On April 29 at Burgh Brawl 15, The 216 Clique (Lou Marconi, Frank Staletto, Will Esquire, & Dan Arkham) lost a Wave The Colors match to The Hansen Brothers (Crusher & Tony Hansen) & The Yinzer Brothers (Gator & Beast).

The series aired on CBS from 1955 to 1967. The series was credited with popularizing the Mighty Mouse character in popular culture far beyond what the original film shorts had done. Mighty Mouse was not extraordinarily popular in theatrical cartoons, but was still Terrytoons' most popular character. What made him a cultural icon was television. Most of the short film studios, both live-action and animated, were in decline by the 1950s, pressured both by the loss of film audiences to television as well as the increased popularity (and financial benefits) of low-budget, stylized, limited animation. Most of the studios cashed out of the short-film production business and began licensing or selling their back catalogs to television. Paul Terry went as far as to sell the entire Terrytoon company to CBS in 1955. The network began running Mighty Mouse Playhouse in December 1955. It remained on the air for nearly twelve years (and featured The Mighty Heroes during the final season). Mighty Mouse cartoons became a staple of children's television programming for a period of over thirty years, from the 1950s through the 1980s. Terrytoons, under CBS ownership, produced only three further Mighty Mouse theatrical cartoons in the 1959‚Äì1961 time frame (this was in marked contrast to other animated cartoon lines such as Looney Tunes, Tom & Jerry and Woody Woodpecker, all of which continued to produce new film shorts for nearly a decade after licensing their library to television). The company evidently believed that the existing library of shorts was enough to keep youngsters tuning into CBS every Saturday morning; the library consisted of 80 shorts, enough for 26 half-hour episodes. Some early vinyls credit the original 1955 Mighty Mouse Playhouse theme song to The Terrytooners, Mitch Miller and Orchestra, but recent publishing has generally credited The Sandpipers.

The film received positive reviews from critics but was a flop at the box office. \\\\- Plot Raunak Kaul (Rajeev Khandelwal) lives, eats and breathes music, having inherited the talent and passion from his deceased father Parth Kaul, who was an unsuccessful musician. He arrives in Mumbai, and starts as a DJ in his uncle Surendra's (Yatin Karyekar) night club Tango Charlie, owned by Charlie (Mohan Kapoor). Raunak soon finds himself expanding his avenues to establishing his own studio, making his own music and composing the score for a movie by Anurag Kashyap. Raunak's starts to lose his hearing, first apparent when he hears a high-pitched ringing sound instead of his interview on TV. At this time, Raunak is making his next album with his mates Banjo (Ankur Tewari) and Biscuit (Siddharth Coutto). Raunak continues working and playing gigs at clubs, but his hearing degrades rapidly and progress on his album stagnates. Raunak refuses to acknowledge his problem until a gig in the club, when he cannot hear the second channel in his headphones and must crossfade one song into the next without being able to beatmatch them. The crowd boos him, and he throws the turntable and the mixer onto the dance floor, and is forcibly removed from the club. Raunak agrees to see a doctor (Manu Rishi), who tells him he's lost hearing in one ear and has 30% left in the other. He warns Raunak that unless he stops abusing drugs and listening to loud noises, he will soon be completely deaf. During a recording session, Raunak confesses the full nature of his hearing loss to Banjo. He inserts his hearing aid to demonstrate, and, overwhelmed by the sudden sound exposure, leans close to one of the monitor speakers. Before he can react, however, a frustrated Biscuit smashes a guitar into an amplifier whose volume is maximized. The noise is excruciating, and the feedback knocks Raunak unconscious. The damage leaves him permanently deaf. Without his hearing, Raunak cannot complete his album. He loses his recording contract, and Charlie abandons him. Soon after, Shonali leaves him. He falls into deep depression, repeatedly throwing his body against the walls. Raunak flushes all his drugs down a toilet, only to be faced with the vision of a menacing badger. Raunak fights and kills it, and removes the badger's head to reveal that the badger is, in fact, himself. Raunak meets Gauri (Soha Ali Khan), an instructor for the deaf who coaches him in lip-reading. They become close, and eventually intimate. He confides his unhappiness at losing music, and she helps him perceive sound through visual and tactile methods instead. Raunak devises a system for mixing songs, in which he watches an oscilloscope trace while resting his feet on the pulsating speakers, managing to produce new mix CD (Raunak Is \\"Hear\\") entirely by himself. He delivers it to Charlie, who is wildly pleased ‚Äì particularly by the potential of using Raunak's disability to increase record sales. Charlie convinces Raunak to play live as a career comeback, despite Raunak's insistence that he has nothing to prove to his critics. The gig goes exceedingly well, and many claim it showcases even greater talent than his early work. After the show, Raunak and Gauri disappear from Charlie, the media, and the music scene altogether. In a talking heads sequence, characters speculate on where he is now (if alive). As the film ends, we see Raunak teaching a group of deaf children how to perceive sound like he does. Additionally, we see Raunak who is then met by Gauri and a child (presumably their own). They affectionately walk together down a street unrecognized.

EmailTray was developed by Internet Promotion Agency S.A., a software development company. EmailTray 2.0 was publicly released on October 7, 2010, as a free desktop email client. It supports multiple accounts using the standard POP3/SMTP or IMAP protocols, with or without SSL. EmailTray combines features of a simple email client and an email notifier that alerts users to the new email messages that EmailTray considers important. History EmailTray originated as SenderOK, an email productivity plug-in for Microsoft Outlook. The main features of SenderOK were email sorting and desktop notification about new prioritized email messages.Cody Burke, BasexBlog. Apart from email sorting, the SenderOK plug-in also offered a social feature: the photo business cards of email senders were displayed along with their email messages. The business card information was retrieved from a proprietary social network hosted at SenderOK.com.Alex Williams, ReadWriteWeb. In case an email sender had no SenderOK profile filled in, the SenderOK plug-in used information from the LinkedIn and Facebook social networks. In October 2010, SenderOK was released as a standalone email client and was rebranded as EmailTray.Peter A. Prestipino, WebsiteMagazine. Basic features EmailTray is an email program that runs in the taskbar area of a Windows PC. The program goes active when a user gets new email messages that EmailTray considers important. At any time the program can be opened and used as a fully functional email client. Protocols and Webmail services supported by EmailTray are: POP3, IMAP and SMTP, Yahoo! Mail, Gmail, Windows Live Hotmail and AOL Mail accounts. All passwords from user's email accounts are stored locally. EmailTray lets users read and compose new messages in plain text or HTML, view attachments and attach files to messages. Users can also forward email messages, reply to emails and create an unlimited number of custom signatures that can be used in new messages and email replies. EmailTray users can create custom rules based on the sender name and sender email address data, email subject contents and recipient data. An EmailTray user can set a sender's priority to Top Priority or Low Priority, assign colors to all messages that conform to a rule, or perform other actions like archiving or moving messages to the Spam folder. To help users manage their emails, EmailTray provides the option to sort emails by date and email account, filter messages by sender and perform instant search through the emails of all tracked accounts. Advanced features Being a simple email client, EmailTray does not offer an electronic calendar, address book, or feed reader options. EmailTray differs from other email clients mainly because of its email management features such as email sorting by priority, as well as alerts about new priority messages. The program offers password protection of the user's mail data. Email sorting and prioritizing EmailTray analyzes a user's email habits such as reading, replying, deleting or forwarding ‚Äì to spot active conversations and give them the highest priority in the Inbox. Messages are then tagged as Top Priority, Low Priority, No Priority and Spam.Dennis O'Reilly, CNET. This feature is similar to the Priority Inbox feature introduced in Gmail on August 30, 2010.Frederic Lardinois, ReadWriteWeb. Priority mail notifications EmailTray notifies its users with a popup alert and sound about new important mail that has arrived to the Top Priority folder. A user can manually change notification settings, e.g. set EmailTray to also notify about messages considered Low Priority, or change the reminder time interval, or use custom sounds for sound alerts. Mail data password protection Once a user installs EmailTray and creates a user account, he/she can protect their EmailTray software copy with a password. At adjustable time intervals, an opened EmailTray client can request a password for emails to be visible.

Retrieved 2011-09-22. Laminaria hyperborea grows on rocks in the sublittoral zone at depths down to about 10 m (35 ft) in turbid waters and down to 30 m (100 ft) where the water is clear.Tangle or cuvie - Laminaria hyperborea Marine Life Information Network. Retrieved 2011-09-22. It tends to be the dominant species in a narrow zone near low-water at spring tides. It also predominates in deeper waters on stable substrates in eave exposed areas while Saccharina latissima tends to be dominant in sheltered areas or those with less stable substrates. Down to about 15 m (50 ft) the growth may be very dense and may be referred to as a \\"kelp forest\\" but at greater depths there is a more open community and these areas have been referred to as \\"parks\\". Biology In young individuals of L. hyperborea, the annual growth consists mainly of the enlargement of the blade. This maximises the photosynthetic opportunity while the plant's low stature causes it to be overshadowed. In later years, more growth takes place in the stipe and holdfast. A new frond grows annually in the spring from the top of the stipe. The old frond is sloughed off later after much of its nutrient content has been transferred to the new growth. Laminaria hyperborea can liberate upward of a million zoospores from sori on the surface of the blade during the course of a few weeks during the winter. These have flagella and settle after about 24 hours before developing into microscopic gametophytes which become fertile in about 10 days. Male gametophytes release large quantities of motile sperm, apparently stimulated to do so by the release of female gametes by the female gametophytes in the vicinity. The fertilised zygotes germinate into young sporophytes which will grow into the mature seaweed. Sexual reproduction is dependent on a minimum quantity of blue light; under less than optimal conditions, the gametophytes may develop vegetatively instead. Ecology Kelp beds provide a nursery area for many marine species and a biodiverse habitat. The grazing behaviour of sea urchins, particularly the green sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, restricts the development of new growth of L. hyperborea. If the urchins become too numerous, whole areas normally dominated by kelp may become \\"urchin barrens\\",Norderhaug, K.M., Christie, H., 2009.

Retrieved 2011-09-22. Laminaria hyperborea is host to a large and diverse community of invertebrates. In one study in Norway, up to 238 species of benthic macrofauna were found associated with it, with a density of 8000 individuals per kelp plant.Species distribution and habitat exploitation of fauna associated with kelp (Laminaria hyperborea) along the Norwegian Coast Retrieved 2011-09-22. The blades were the part of the plant least populated by invertebrates. They were however covered by a bacterial biofilm in which Planctomycetes and Alphaproteobacteria were found all year long and other bacteria occurred seasonally. The stipes, being rough, provided good anchor points for Palmaria palmata and several other species of red algae. The resulting epiphytic growth was home to a range of species of gastropods, amphipods and other invertebrates. Depending upon the season and density of the L. hyperborea bed, the total number of these animals varied; at one location, it ranged from a small number to over 80,000 individuals living on a single stipe. The holdfasts offered a sheltered refuge and housed a large number of mobile macrofauna, a community that was quite different from that on the stipes. In a study undertaken on the north east coast of Britain, 61 different species of nematode were found living in the holdfasts of L. hyperborea. The majority of these were omnivores feeding on deposits or herbivores feeding on the epiphytic algae growing on the kelp.The Nematode Fauna Associated With Holdfasts of Kelp (Laminaria hyperborea) in North-East Britain Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, 1971. Retrieved 2011-09-22. In another study comparing the macrofauna resident in the holfasts of L. hyperborea round the coasts of Britain, it was found that, except for the suspension feeders, there was an inverse relationship between the richness of the flora and the pollution, as measured by the heavy metal content of the water, and its clarity.

The date in which it was executed is unknown, but most art historians agree that it was painted during the last part of Lippi's career, between 1450 and 1465. It is one of the few works by Lippi which was not executed with the help of his workshop and was an influential model for later depictions of the Madonna and Child, including those by Sandro Botticelli. The painting is housed in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence, Italy, and is therefore commonly called ‚ÄúThe Uffizi Madonna‚Äù among art historians. Background A self-portrait of Fra Filippo Lippi. Fra Filippo was born in 1406 in Florence to a poor family where his father was a butcher. He entered a monastery with his brother at an early age. Later in his life, he was moved to a monastery in Prato, and here fell in love with a nun, Lucrezia Buti, with whom he had two children. He encountered more trouble when his patrons claimed that Fra Filippo did not fulfill his contracts. Fra Filippo's main patrons were the Medicis. History The commission and the exact execution date of the painting are unknown. In 1457, Giovanni de‚Äô Medici wished to gift a panel to the King of Naples and commissioned Fra Filippo to paint it. Fra Filippo, who was working in Prato at that time, decided to temporarily return to his residence in Florence to work on this project. Fra Filippo wrote letters to Giovanni that show that the painter abandoned the project because of a lack of funding. Although art historian Ulmann believes that Fra Filippo presented the Uffizi Madonna to Giovanni to thank him for acting as an intermediary between him and the King of Naples, Edward C. Strutt states that this belief is incorrect. However, he also states that the Uffizi Madonna was in all probability executed around this time, while Fra Filippo was staying in Florence. This is also demonstrated by the techniques that Fra Filippo used to realize this painting: the blunt execution and the bold colors highlight how the painter was influenced by the technique of fresco painting. Since he acquired such techniques by working at the Prato Cathedral, long before he moved to Florence, Strutt believes that Fra Filippo must have executed this painting after his time working at the Cathedral. The Madonna is traditionally identified with Lucrezia Buti, as for most of Fra Filippo's Madonnas. Another possible interpretation of the painting is that the unusual size is perhaps connected to a personal event, such as the birth of his son, Filippino (1457): however, if Filippino was chosen as model for the angel in the foreground, the panel could be from a date as late as around 1465. An 18th-century inscription in the rear of the panel testifies the presence of the painting in the Medici Villa del Poggio Imperiale at the time. On 13 May 1796 it entered the Gran Ducal collections in Florence, which formed the base of the future Uffizi museum. Description Fra Filippo's National Gallery of Art Madonna and Child, c. 1440, one of the artist's earlier Madonnas. The Uffizi Madonna is associated with the taste of the new age, as the Madonna is ‚Äúlovelier and more fashionable than any of Filippo‚Äôs earlier Madonnas‚Äù. The group of Madonna and Child is, unusually for the period, placed in front of an open window beyond which is a landscape inspired to Flemish painting. The Madonna sits on a chair, at the window of a house located on a hilltop, which offers a view of an elaborate landscape of ‚Äúplains, distant mountains, a city and a bay‚Äù. Her eyes are pointed down and her hands are folded in prayers before child Jesus, who is held up to her by two angels. She is wearing an elaborate coiffure with a soft veil and pearls: these elements, along with her costume, represent the elegance of the mid-1400s and were re-used in numerous late 15th century works in Florence. Furthermore, as in many Renaissance paintings, the Madonna's hair is shaved farther back because, ‚Äúthe forehead [was] an object of special beauty‚Äù that resembled ‚Äúa glowing, beautifully set pearl‚Äù. Fra Filippo's Madonna with the Child and Scenes from the Life of St Anne, also known as the Pitti tondo. It is closely related to the Uffizi Madonna. This Madonna resembles other Madonnas from the same artist. For example, it is closely related to Fra Filippo's Pitti tondo Madonna, but it lacks ‚Äúthe pathetic girlish loveliness‚Äù of the Pitti tondo and rather has ‚Äúa more womanly and mature type of beauty‚Äù. The angel on the right is one of the most curious parts of the painting: he is looking at the viewer with a ‚Äúroguish smile, more expressive of mischief than of seraphic perfection‚Äù. His pose does not resemble that of an angel, and he does not seem to be playing his part, rather he seems to be the real child. Technique The large window placed behind the Madonna helps reducing the gap between the viewer and the figures, which are also very close to the plane to assist in making the viewer feel part of the painting. Fra Filippo's fresco background from his time in Prato influences this painting from the coloring and the inattention to details. The colors are applied in bold strokes, that almost look independent from each other, which shows that Fra Filippo was ‚Äútaking very little trouble to ensure harmonious blending of the various tints‚Äù, which is a characteristic of frescoes. The composition of the painting is of pyramidal shape, and the foreground and background are arranged in a way that suggest that Fra Filippo was also influenced by the methods of Donatello‚Äôs school. The Feast of Herod, a fresco by Fra Filippo, part of Stories of St. Stephen and St. John the Baptist, c. 1452‚Äì1465. From his earlier paintings, it is evident that Fra Filippo was influenced by Masaccio. However, Masaccio‚Äôs chiaroscuro has disappeared in the Uffizi Madonna, and figures are now illuminated by a soft glow with harsh shadows. This greatly reduces the sense of volume that was peculiar in Fra Filippo‚Äôs earlier paintings. Symbolism This painting contains religious symbols: there are rocks and the seashore outside the window, which are recurrent themes in Florentine Renaissance paintings. The seashore probably alludes to the Virgin Mary‚Äôs title ‚Äústar of the sea and port of our salvation‚Äù, and the rocks allude to the tales of prophet Daniel Interpretation The angel on the right has always been of particular importance to art historians. Marylin Lavin argues that the Uffizi Madonna ‚Äúshould be understood as a representation of the marriage of Christ and the Virgin Mary‚Äù. According to Barnaby Nygren, the fact that the Madonna is not holding the child, but rather he is being presented to her argues Lavin's interpretation. However, Bernard Berenson argues that ‚Äúthe relationship between bride and groom is not as the Virgin Mary and Christ but rather as the individual devout soul and God‚Äù. Finally, Jonathan Jones argues that the Madonna is ‚Äúone of the most beautiful paintings of the Renaissance‚Äù and an exemplification of the humanizing of religion that dates back to Giotto. According to him, Fra Filippo, with this painting, makes the relation between the Madonna and the child that of a real mother and baby.
