Uz His father Nikita (Mkrtich) Ivanovich Mergelov, a former private entrepreneur (Nepman), his mother Lyudmila Ivanovna Vyrodova, the daughter of the manager of the Azov- Black Sea bank, who was shot in 1918. In 1936 Sergey's father was building a paper mill in Yelets, but soon together with his family was deported to the Siberian settlement of Narym, Tomsk Region. In the Siberian frost, Sergey suffered from a serious illness and narrowly survived. In 1937, the mother and son were acquitted by the court's decision and returned to Kerch, and in 1938 Lyudmila Ivanovna obtained (from the USSR Prosecutor General Andrei Yanushyevich Vyshinsky) the rehabilitation of her husband. In 1941, in connection with the offensive of the Hitler armies to the South, the Mergelov family left Kerch and settled in Yerevan. = Education = Before the war, Mergelyan lived in Russia, and studied at the Kerch secondary school. When at the end of 1941 his family has moved from Kerch to Yerevan, he got into a completely unfamiliar environment, he did not know Armenian at all. He studied at the Yerevan school named after Mravyan. Soon he excelled in his abilities. In 1943, Mergelyan won the first place at the republican physics and mathematics Olympiad. In 1944, at age 16, he passed the examinations via extern for grades 9-10, graduated from high school and immediately entered the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of the Yerevan State University (YSU). He drew attention to himself at the university, where he during a year passed the first and second courses, and soon began attending lectures of academician Artashes Shahinyan, the founder of the Armenian mathematical school. In addition to studying and working in the seminar, Mergelyan taught in the mathematical circle at the Yerevan Palace of Pioneers. There he gave full freedom to fantasy, writing puzzles for children by conducting competitions to solve particularly difficult tasks and organizing mathematical games. He passed a five-year university course for three years, in the first year he studied only a few days, then via extern had passed exams and immediately switched to the second, and in 1946 he received a diploma. At the same time, he restored the original surname on his father's line and received a diploma already as Sergey Nikitovich Mergelyan. After YSU (1946), Mergelyan entered the postgraduate study at Steklov Institute of Mathematics to Mstislav Vsevolodovich Keldysh. Although all his colossal employment, Keldysh paid special attention to his new graduate student. They met mainly at Keldysh's house, at 8-9 o'clock in the evening, and conducted long conversations about mathematical problems. A thesis for the degree on physical and mathematical sciences, Mergelyan wrote for a year and a half. The defense took place in 1949 and was brilliant. After an hour and a half session, the academic council announced the awarding of a doctorate in physics and mathematics to Mergelyan. Although Mergelyan introduced to defend the Ph.D. dissertation, all three official opponents - Academician Lavrent'ev, Sergei Mikhailovich Nikol'skii and Corresponding Member Alexander Osipovich Gelf–ænd - petitioned the Academic Council to award him the Doctor of Science degree. The petition of opponents was satisfied (for this it was necessary to call the members of the scientific council, which took time), and Mergelyan became the youngest doctor of physical and mathematical sciences in the USSR at the age of 20 (at 21). Until today this is a record of getting the highest scientific degree (Doctor of Science) at such a young age in former USSR and present Russia. = Career = Mergelyan graduated from Yerevan University in 1947. From 1945 to 1957 he worked at the Yerevan University, and from 1954 to 1958 and from 1964 to 1968 at the Moscow State University named after MV Lomonosov. When he was 24 he became a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (now Russian Academy of Sciences), which, from the point of view of young age, is yet another absolute record among USSR scientists. He has been a symbol of a young scientist in former USSR. Indira Gandhi, among other famous people in USSR and abroad, has been a friend of Mergelyan from the early 1950s. In 1978, after her official visit to Moscow, Gandhi had also a private visit to Yerevan just as a guest of Mergelyan.In 1952 he was awarded USSR State Prize. Mergelyan was also a talented organizer of science. He played a leading role in establishing Yerevan Scientific Research Institute of Mathematical Machines (YerSRIMM). On July 14, 1956, the Yerevan Scientific Research Institute of Mathematical Machines (YerNIIMM) was founded‚Ä§ He became the first director of the institute and headed it in 1956-1960. Soon the institute became popular as the \\"Mergelyan Institute\\". This unofficial name is preserved and still used nowadays‚Ä§ In 1961 he returned to the field of pure mathematics. He resumed work at the Moscow Steklov Mathematical Institute of Academy of Sciences of the USSR. In 1963 he was elected Deputy Academician of the Secretary of the Department of Mathematics of the USSR Academy of Sciences (Nikolai Nikolaevich Bogolyubov). In 1964 he was appointed head of the department of complex analysis at the Mathematical Institute, the position he retained until 2002, the same year he was reinstated as a professor of the Mechanics and Mathematics Faculty of the Moscow State University. In 1968, he again left the post of professor of the faculty and only engaged in scientific work. Mergelyan had \\"traveling permission\\", and often was on foreign business trips. In 1970 he gave a presentation as a guest speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Nice.  Scientific works  Mergelyan's main works include theory of functions of complex variables, theory of approximation, and theory of potential and harmonic functions. In 1951 he formulated and proved the famous result from complex analysis called Mergelyan's theorem. This solved an old classical problem. The theorem completed a long series of studies, begun in 1885, and composed of the classical results of Karl Weierstrass, Karl Runge, J. Walsh, Mikhail Lavrentiev, Mstislav Keldysh and others. The new terms \\"Mergelyan's theorem\\" and \\"Mergelyan's sets\\" found their place in textbooks and monographs on approximation theory. Several years later he solved another famous problem, the Sergei Natanovich Bernstein Approximation Problem. Mergelyan also has many important results in other areas of complex analysis including the theory of pointwise approximations by polynomials. His research was the study of the approximation of continuous functions satisfying the smoothness properties for an arbitrary set (1962) and the solution of Bernstein's approximate problem (1963). Mergelyan conducted in-depth studies and obtained valuable results in such areas as best approximation by polynomials on an arbitrary continuum, weighted approximations by polynomials on the real axis, pointwise approximation by polynomials on closed sets of the complex plane, uniform approximation by harmonic functions on compact sets and entire functions on an unbounded continuum, uniqueness harmonic functions. In the theory of differential equations, his results related to the sphere of the Cauchy problem and some other questions. Mergelyan's scientific achievements significantly contributed to the formation, development and international recognition of the Armenian mathematical school, as evidenced by the one organized in Yerevan in 1965, at the initiative and with the active participation of Sergey Mergelyan a major international conference on the theory of functions. Many prominent mathematicians of the world took part in the conference, which promoted international cooperation and further promotion of the Armenian mathematical school.  Death  Sergey Mergelyan died August 20, 2008. The farewell ceremony took place on August 23, 2008 at the Glendale Cemetery in California. At the request of the deceased, his ashes were transported to Moscow and buried at Novodevichy Cemetery next to his mother and his wife.

He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature six times. Biography Olaf Bull was born in Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway. His parents were author Jacob Breda Bull (1853‚Äì1930) and his second wife Maria Augusta Bergl√∂f (1854‚Äì1922). Bull grew up and was mostly raised in Kristiania. At the age of 13, he lived for some time in Hurum in Buskerud, where his father worked as a journalist and editor. In 1899, he started gymnasium at Aars og Voss' skole. He attended Kristiania Cathedral School prior to his graduation from private school in 1902. After his graduation he lived with his family in Rome before returning to Kristiania in 1903 to begin his studies at the university. Olaf Bull could be considered a polymath because in addition to both modern and classical literature, he mastered philosophy, history, politics, art and science. He spent several years as a journalist for Posten and Dagbladet . He was known as the ‚ÄúOslo- poet,‚Äù but he lived for extended periods in both Italy and in France where his son, poet Jan Bull (1927‚Äì1985) was born. Olaf Bull was married three times and divorced twice. Economic issues coupled with abuse of alcohol had a strong impact on his life. He had a nervous disposition and developed signs of depression. His last year was characterized by illness and alcoholism. He had physical ailments, including partial paralysis and liver damage. Olaf Bull died at age 49 at Ullev√•l Hospital in Oslo. His urn was placed at V√•r Frelsers gravlund. His poetry Bull's poetry collection Digte (Poems) (1909) formed the foundation upon which he came to be recognized as Norway's foremost poet. Olaf Bull composed his poetry using what is called in Norwegian sentrallyrikk -- poems about ‚Äúcentral themes‚Äù such as love, sorrow and death. He used fixed stanza patterns and was known for his strong and emotional depictions. His poetry and work conveys a melancholy sense that all is transitory. In spite of this disconsolate tone, his recurring and powerful use of mood, faultless form and expressive voice communicate his belief that, although evanescent, art and beauty are important. Giovanni Bach described his work in this way: :\\"His poems reveal a masculine power and a forceful affirmation of his own individuality, notwithstanding the extreme pessimism that often envelopes them in a voluminous thick black veil. His poetry is deeply felt, rich in imaginative and intellectual quality.\\" Giovanni Bach. The History of the Scandinavian Literatures (edited by Frederika Blankner, 1938, Dial Press, Inc., New York) Bull utilized his extensive knowledge and artistic strength, but showed an underlying fear and depression. Olaf Bull was known to be anti- authority and was regarded an ‚Äúoutsider‚Äù in society, but his poetry demonstrated that he never totally broke with traditional form and structure. Much of his poetry showed a powerful longing for the eternal and persistent. This longing was most apparent when he wrote about classical motifs. Bull and Joyce While James Joyce was working on Finnegans Wake, he wanted to insert references to Scandinavian languages and literature, hiring five teachers of Norwegian. Bull was the first one. Joyce wanted to read Norwegian works in the original language, including Peter Andreas Munch's Norr√∏ne Gude- og Heltesagn (Norse Tales of Gods and Heroes). He was looking for puns and weird associations across the barriers of language, which was something Bull well understood. Lines from Bull's poems echo through \\"this spider's web of words\\", as Joyce himself called Finnegans Wake, and Bull himself materializes under the name \\"Olaph the Oxman\\", a pun on his surname. In his letters home, Bull mentioned nothing about Joyce, most likely because he often asked his family for money, which would sound unconvincing with him at the same time being a teacher for a world-famous author. It is not known how Joyce got in contact with Bull, but both frequented the bookstore Shakespeare and Company in Paris which was run by Sylvia Beach, who may have brought them in contact with each other. In 1926 Ulysses was issued as an unlicensed copy in the United States, meaning that Joyce would receive no money for it. Together with Beach he wrote a protest letter, intending it to be signed by well-known writers from the whole of Europe. Beach mentions in her memoirs that Joyce was particularly eager to have Bull sign it. Beach tracked Bull, who had left Paris to live in the French countryside. On behalf of Joyce she sent a man there to have the protest signed. Bull's wife Suzanne provided him with a copy of Bull's signature.Fredrik Wandrup: \\"Norskl√¶rer Bull\\", Dagbladet, June 22, 2004  Bibliography  = Works published during his lifetime= * Digte (Poems), Gyldendal, 1909 * Nye Digte (New Poems), Gyldendal, 1913 * Mitt navn er Knoph (My Name is Knoph), Narveson, 1914 * Digte og noveller (Poems and Short Stories), Gyldendal, 1916 * Samlede digte 1909-1919 (Collected Poems), Gyldendal, 1919 * Stjernerne (Stars), Gyldendal, 1924 * Metope, Gyldendal, 1927 * De hundrede aar (The Hundred Years), Gyldendal, 1928 * Kj√¶rlighet (Love), Gyldendal, 1929 * Oinos og Eros, Gyldendal, 1930 * Ignis ardens, Gyldendal, 1932 =Play= * Kj√¶rlighetens farse:tre akter (Love's Farce: Three Acts), Aschehoug, 1919, published 1948.

After earning her doctorate at Yale University, she taught at Manhattan College for thirty- two years before becoming a professor emeritus. She was one of the creators of the Journal for Feminist Studies in Religion and was its editor for the first ten years. She also helped to create B'not Esh, a Jewish feminist group that heavily inspired her writing, and a feminist section of the American Academy of Religion, an organization that she was president of in 1998. Plaskow's work has been critical in developing Jewish feminist theology. Her most significant work, Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective, argued that the absence of female perspectives in Jewish history has had a negative impact on the religion and she urged Jewish feminists to reclaim their place in the Torah and in Jewish thought. It is one of the first Jewish feminist theological texts ever written and is considered by some to be one of the most important Jewish texts of the 20th century. Her essay \\"The Coming of Lilith\\" was critical in re-imagining Lilith as a positive figure for women instead of a dangerous demon. Plaskow imagines Lilith as a woman who was wrongly punished for desiring her rightful equality to Adam. Once Eve seeks Lilith out, they join together in sisterhood to build a better world. Since \\"The Coming of Lilith,\\" Lilith has become an important figure to Jewish feminists and became the namesake of the Jewish feminist magazine Lilith. From a young age, she viewed ethics and activism as integral to Judaism, which influenced her contributions to feminist ethics. She came out as a lesbian in the 1980s and though sexuality was always a focus of hers, her article in \\"Twice Blessed: On Being Lesbian or Gay and Jewish,\\" was her most formal and popular discussion of being a Jewish lesbian.  Early life  Judith Plaskow was born in Brooklyn, New York on March 14, 1947. Her parents were Vivian Cohen Plaskow, a remedial reading teacher, and Jerome Plaskow, a Certified Public Accountant. Her younger sister, Harriet, was born in 1950. The Plaskows moved to West Hempstead, Long Island and Plaskow attended public school there. She described her neighborhood as diverse in religions, but not in races. As soon as she was able to start going into New York City with her friends, she began to resent her town and was increasingly focused on the city. Growing up, Plaskow was a part of a classical reform congregation and completed twelve years of Hebrew school. Her early religious education was universalist and stressed how God calls Jewish people to be the \\"light unto the nations,\\" which motivated her view that ethics and activism are crucial to Jewish practice. Plaskow thought her congregation was \\"typical in its treatment of women as second-class citizens.\\" Her rabbi was opposed to allowing women to be ordained and disagreed with both bar and bat mitzvahs, wanting children to continue Hebrew school until confirmation in the ninth grade. He was convinced by parents to hold bar mitzvah ceremonies but insisted on the girls (including Plaskow) having a Hebrew recognition ceremony as a group. Plaskow reports that she always felt that there was something wrong with all these inconsistencies, but was too young to deconstruct what she saw. Plaskow was very interested in theology and ethics as a child due to her Reform congregation and a natural proclivity for theology. She attended the 1963 March on Washington with members of her congregation and saw Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech which inspired her to imagine a world transformed by gender equality, the way he had imagined one transformed by racial equality. After learning about the Holocaust in school, Plaskow raised her first theological questions about good and evil. Her interest grew from this point and she became the only student at her Hebrew school who actually wanted to be there. She always hoped she would learn something valuable there, though she says she never did. Throughout junior high and high school, Plaskow dreamed of becoming a rabbi, even though women rabbis were unheard of and opposed by many, including her own rabbi. However, she had her own reservations. She wanted to be a trailblazer but felt she couldn't as long as she wasn't certain she believed in God. Her life changed during a Neilah service on Yom Kippur when she realized she could get a doctorate in theology instead. She admits becoming a rabbi would've been much less work and she would've been the second ever female rabbi, but she says she was \\"born a theologian\\" and is now sure she made the right choice.  Education  Plaskow obtained her B.A. magna cum laude from Clark University in 1968 which included spending her junior year abroad at the University of Edinburgh. Edinburgh was her first experience of being one of very few Jewish people in a mainly Christian setting and showed her how she easily put Christian questions in the Jewish context. It made her more comfortable applying to Protestant theology programs after she graduated, a necessity due to the dearth of Jewish programs and lack of a religion department at Clark University. From there, she was trained in Protestant theology and earned her Ph.D from Yale Divinity School in 1975. Her dissertation was written at Concordia University while she was an adjunct and it was later published as Sex, Sin, and Grace: Women‚Äôs Experience and the Theologies of Reinhold Niebuhr and Paul Tillich. The subject was in-line with her Protestant training, but she was mostly inspired by Valerie Saiving's 1960 article, \\"The Human Situation: a Feminist View\\" which echoed her concern that the lack of women in theology warped theological study. She sought out to build on Saiving's work by also analyzing Niebuhr and by attempting to reduce the article's gender essentialism, which is where she thought Saiving erred in her argument. She focused on interpreting how the Protestant doctrines of sin and grace related to women's experiences.  Academic career  Plaskow's first professorship was at New York University. Unfortunately, the university's religious studies department shut down halfway through her first year there and she was sent looking for new work. She then found herself teaching at Wichita State University from 1976-79. She relished her time at Wichita because of the institution's robust religious and women's studies departments, but feared ending up stuck in Kansas and began to look elsewhere. She finally found a long term home at Manhattan College, where she ended up teaching for thirty two years and earned the title of professor emetrius. The college's religious department was mostly Catholic, but this was no obstacle to Plaskow. She enjoyed learning more about Catholic theology and her position as an outsider allowed her to ask questions others may not have, including questioning her own religion. After a long period of mainly focusing on Christian theology, Plaskow's sights gradually turned back to Judaism. She attended her first American Academy of Religion (AAR) conference in 1970 and was dismayed by the lack of women present. She didn't attend the conference in 1971, but Carol P. Christ, Elizabeth Sch√ºssler Fiorenza, and other women created a women's caucus, a working group on women and religion, and elected the first woman president of the AAR, Christine Downing. The working group met for the first time in 1972, marking the beginning of women's studies in religion. Mary Daly relayed her first ideas for Beyond God the Father at this meeting and also gave her position as co-chair of the group to Plaskow. A few years later, the group became an official section of the AAR after successfully arguing that they were creating a new field of religious study and needed the space and authority to do so. The section became her home base for the academic study of religion and feminism. At the first national Jewish feminist conference in February, 1973, Plaskow gave a lecture titled \\"The Jewish Feminist: Conflict of Identities\\" and was met with a standing ovation. She gave several lectures through the 1970s questioning if a woman could truly be a Jew, concluding that Judaism is passed down by women, but it's never truly received or owned by them. In 1979, she and her longtime collaborator and friend Carol P. Christ edited Womanspirit Rising: A Feminist Reader in Religion through the Yale Women's Alliance and it became a seminal anthology on feminist spirituality. It was one of the first of its kind and its success would later lead to the pair releasing another anthology, Weaving the Visions: New Patterns in Feminist Spirituality in 1989. She got her first chance to teach a Jewish feminism and theology class at the first National Havurah Summer Institute in 1980. This opportunity was a personal breakthrough for Plaskow; she finally felt all of the aspects of her identity falling into alignment after feeling so much tension between them. After her first class, she was inspired to write \\"The Right Question is Theological,\\" partly in response to Cynthia Ozick's article, \\"Notes Towards Finding the Right Question.\\" Plaskow's article was published in 1982 and it laid down her feminist criticisms of key concepts in Judaism like the Torah, God, and Israel, using feminist midrash to argue that halakhah should be taken as secondary to theology. She considers it one of her quintessential works. Riding off the joy of studying together at the National Havurah Summer Institute, Plaskow and other like-minded women formed B'not Esh (\\"daughters of fire\\" in Hebrew) in 1981 as a Jewish feminist spirituality collective which has been meeting for 36 years. This group was indispensable to Plaskow in imagining and creating Jewish feminism; she believes she couldn't have written Standing Again at Sinai without B'not Esh. She created the Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion with Sch√ºssler Fiorenza and they published their first edition in spring, 1985. Plaskow served as editor for ten years and the journal still exists today. In her influential book Standing Again at Sinai, Plaskow wrote that the Torah, and Jews' conception of their own history, have been written by and in the language of a male patriarchy in a manner that sanctions the marginalization of women, and must be reclaimed by redefining its content to include material on women's experiences. She famously wrote \\"We must render visible the presence, experience, and deeds of women erased in traditional sources. We must tell the stories of women's encounters with God and capture the texture of their religious experience...To expand Torah, we must reconstruct Jewish history to include the history of women, and in doing so alter the shape of Jewish memory.\\" Making this history visible is essential to developing feminist midrash in her eyes. \\"The Coming of Lilith\\" (1972) continued the Jewish feminist tradition of examining female archetypes in the Bible like Queen Esther and Lilith. Lilith was Adam's original mate and was created as equal to him. Lilith fled Eden when she was denied sexual equality, was replaced by submissive Eve, and became a she-demon who fed on infant boys. Plaskow imagines Lilith as waiting for Eve to come find her outside the walls of Eden and after Eve arrives and they've bonded, they'll rebuild the world together, which Adam and God fear. Plaskow's work helped turn Lilith from the prototypical example of what a woman shouldn't be to an empowered figurehead for women's liberation. Her most recent book, Goddess and God in the World: Conversations in Embodied Theology, was released in 2016. It's another collaboration with Christ in which they draw on their personal experiences to develop and argue in favor of the embodied theological method. Judith's view of God/Goddess as an \\"impersonal creative power\\" contrasts Christ's view of Goddess/God as a personal, loving force but instead of trying to reconcile their views, they argue that this difference shows that theology is deeply personal and embodied and we must consider how our experiences impact our theological discussions.  Personal life  Plaskow married rabbinics scholar Robert Goldberg in 1967. They worked together at New York University, Concordia University, and Wichita State University. Their son, Alexander Goldberg, was born in 1977. When she came out as a lesbian in 1984, she separated from Goldenberg. She has a seven year old (as of 2019) granddaughter. At the second meeting of B'not Esh in 1983, Plaskow realized she had fallen in love with Martha Ackelsberg, a member of B'not Esh and a government and women's studies professor at Smith College. After her separation from Goldberg, she and Ackelsberg began a long distance relationship for thirty years before moving in together. They're still together today but have decided never to marry, rejecting the idea that rights should be tied to marriage in support of building intimate lives on one's own terms. Her lesbianism was an open secret in her social circles after she came out, but she didn't explicitly connect herself to lesbianism in academia immediately. Standing Again at Sinai's discussion of sexuality doesn't probe the author's lesbianism but she does use \\"our\\" when talking about homosexual identities. It was only when she published \\"Twice Blessed: On Being Lesbian or Gay and Jewish\\" that she labeled herself and it was read as a \\"lesbian treatise,\\" even though much of the writing was taken from Standing Again at Sinai. The years following Standing at Sinai saw her write several essays on sexuality, four of which appear in The Coming of Lilith: Essays on Feminism, Judaism, and Sexual Ethics, 1972‚Äì2003, which was published in 2005. She says coming out increased her creativity and underlies her scholarship and views, even if her work isn't explicitly about her lesbianism. Plaskow credits her friends and colleagues with shaping and progressing her ideas about Jewish feminist theology. She met Carol P. Christ in 1969 when she was the only other woman in the theology program at Yale. Christ became a friend, editor, collaborator, and sounding board for Plaskow, a relationship they still have today. Christ guided Plaskow's dissertation and Plaskow says she couldn't have completed her degree without Christ's help. They've since worked together on many projects. Elizabeth Sch√ºssler Fiorenza was also very influential to Plaskow. They founded JFSR together and she credits Sch√ºssler Fiorenza's 1983 book, In Memory of Her with expanding her perception of Jewish women's history. The women of B'not Esh, including Ackelsberg, Marcia Falk, Drorah Setel, and Sue Levi Elwell also had a life-changing impact on Plaskow's development of a specifically Jewish feminist theology.  Legacy as a feminist theologian  Plaskow is considered to be one of the most significant and well-known feminist theologians of the twentieth century for her foundational contributions to her field. As a trailblazer, her path was not without obstacles. In Womanspirit Rising: A Feminist Reader in Religion, she recalls how her professors discouraged her and Christ from pursuing feminist theology. One professor dismissed Christ's feminist theology essay in favour of discussing her male classmates' essays because he didn't think Christ's topic was important. Their proposal to study historical attitudes towards women in Christianity for their theses was angrily rejected by a professor. This was no surprise to Plaskow because when she entered academia, theology was a heavily male dominated field and little attention had been paid to women in theology. Her contributions to Jewish feminist theology in particular have proved to be invaluable. She was the first Jewish feminist to call herself a theologian and Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective (1990) was the first Jewish feminist text dedicated to theology. Her work came at a moment in time where the Jewish Renewal Movement and women gaining secular leadership roles had paved the way for women to become rabbis, prayer leaders, and overall, more visible in their religious communities. Midrash, the act and the product of re-interpreting religious texts to understand changes in society in continuity with Jewish tradition, became very concerned with the feminist movement and how it related to Judaism. Standing Again at Sinai offered a way to conceptualize women in Jewish history while dealing with the patriarchal power and language of Judaism, inspiring an outpouring of Jewish feminist work as Plaskow encouraged the development of feminist midrash. Additionally, her collaboration with Christ in Womanspirit Rising was significant for placing Jewish feminist writing alongside feminist writing from other religions, increasing the visibility of Jewish feminism. Plaskow acknowledges Standing Again at Sinai as her most influential work, but states that her greatest contribution to Jewish feminist theology is her methodology. She has continuously insisted that it isn't enough to put women in traditionally male roles, rather we must re-imagine and rebuild the system from the ground up. Additionally, her assertion that women's perspectives have been ignored in Jewish history and that Jewish feminists are called to reclaim the female perspective has inspired a wealth of scholarship. She has long emphasized the value of sisterhood and understanding things through other women, informed by her experiences with Christ, the AAR, Yale Women's Alliance, and B'not Esh. She says her work is founded upon and she derives her authority from her experience of developing a sense of self through community with other women. Plaskow has often spoke about the value of \\"the yeah, yeah experience,\\" in which women talking about their lives to each other discover how much they have in common. This is similar to the consciousness raising efforts promoted by feminists and Civil Rights activists since the late 1960s. Her understanding of sisterhood is reflected in her interpretation of Lilith, which emphasizes the value of a sisterhood between her and Eve. Despite her feeling that there is a natural and fruitful understanding between all women, she acknowledges that there is no universal experience of womanhood. She realizes the importance of racial and class differences, especially with regard to sexuality and religion. Due to her belief that social justice and ethics are essential to Judaism and feminism, Plaskow has advocated for many causes in her career. She attended a Black Lives Matter march in 2014 in protest of the decision not to indict Daniel Pantaleo for the death of Eric Garner. She encourages Jewish feminists to engage with other social issues like Black Lives Matter and global warming.  Criticism  Thalia Gur Klein criticized Plaskow's The Coming of Lilith for replicating interpretations of the bible Klein sees as anti-Judaism. Klein disagrees with Plaskow that men are dominant in the bible, rather they are as dominant as women, citing examples in which women exercised their dominance. In Plaskow's reading of Leviticus 18, she argues that these rules pertaining to sexuality were created to protect men's social status, not protect women and children, and that's why scripture allows for a man to sexually abuse his daughter or granddaughter. Klein says this is a misinterpretation and it is not allowed, insisting the laws were made to protect women and children. Klein criticized Plaskow's relation of Israeli violence to the story of Esther because it perpetuated the idea that Jewish people have a \\"tradition of genocide\\" enacted then against the Persians and now against Palestinians. Klein argues that the Israeli link is unnecessary and partially inaccurate, in both cases arguing that Jews were resisting aggression, not carrying out genocides. She says it's important that Plaskow and other feminists be careful not to fall back on anti-Judaism readings of Hebrew texts in trying to analyze their patriarchal nature. Publications *J.

Facts The Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1964,. dealt with income tax and social services. Section 11 of the Act exempted certain superannuation funds from income tax if they invested in government securities. Fairfax was subject to the tax but challenged it by arguing it was a law with respect to superannuation funds, not an exercise of the taxation power. Decision Per Kitto J: The Commonwealth law was in substance a law with respect to taxation. A tax does not cease to be valid because it regulates, discourages, or even definitely deters the activities taxed. The plaintiffs argued that if superannuation funds fully undertook the law, and invested in government securities, then the Section 11 provision would result in no taxation revenue for the government. The Court however thought the issue of raising revenue was a secondary concern. The law was still concerned with taxation because it imposed a taxation obligation. The fact that the purpose was to deter superannuation funds, did not preclude it from being a matter with respect to taxation. As s51(ii) was a non-purposive head of power, like all such powers, it operates on the subject matter.

One of the first drawings of a Banksia species, it was produced by one of Sir Joseph Banks' London artists, based on original drawings by Sydney Parkinson, who was present when the genus was first collected at Botany Bay. As with other flowering plants, the taxonomy of Banksia has traditionally been based on anatomical and morphological properties of the Banksia flower, fruiting structure and seed, along with secondary characteristics such as leaf structure and growth habit. Increasingly, molecular evidence from DNA is providing important new insights into relationships within the genus and between this and other genera in the Proteaceae. The genus is placed in family Proteaceae, subfamily Grevilleoideae, tribe Banksieae and subtribe Banksiinae. The most recent complete revision is that published in Alex George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series; this recognises two subgenera, three sections, 13 series, 77 species, 6 subspecies and 18 varieties, and treats the traditionally related genus Dryandra as separate but closely related. Recent molecular cladistic analyses have provided an alternative view in which Dryandra is shown to be nested inside, and hence should be included within, Banksia. This interpretation has been controversial in some circles, and is not universally accepted. Background Banksia (in the traditional sense, not including Dryandra), is a genus of around 80 species in the plant family Proteaceae. An iconic Australian wildflower and popular garden plant, they are easily recognised by their characteristic flower spikes and fruiting \\"cones\\". They grow in forms varying from prostrate woody shrubs to trees up to 35 metres tall, and occur in all but the most arid areas of Australia. As heavy producers of nectar, they are important sources of food for nectariferous animals such as honeyeaters and honey possums, and they are of economic importance to the nursery and cut flower industries. However they are threatened by a number of processes, including land clearing, frequent burning, and disease; and a number of species are rare and endangered. Taxonomic history Banksia was first described in Carolus Linnaeus the Younger's April 1782 publication Supplementum Plantarum. Specimens of Banksia were first collected by Sir Joseph Banks and Dr Daniel Solander, naturalists on the Endeavour during Lieutenant (later Captain) James Cook's first voyage to the Pacific Ocean. Cook landed on Australian soil for the first time on 29 April 1770, at a place that he later named Botany Bay in recognition of \\"the great quantity of plants Mr Banks and Dr Solander found in this place\\". Over the next seven weeks, Banks and Solander collected thousands of plant specimens, including the first specimens of a new genus that would later be named Banksia in Banks' honour. Four species were present in this first collection: B. serrata (Saw Banksia), B. integrifolia (Coast Banksia), B. ericifolia (Heath-leaved Banksia) and B. robur (Swamp Banksia). In June the ship was careened at Endeavour River, where specimens of B. dentata (Tropical Banksia) were collected. Every specimen collected during the Endeavour voyage was sketched by Banks' botanical illustrator Sydney Parkinson. On the Endeavours return to England in July 1771, Banks' specimens became part of his London herbarium, and artists were employed to paint watercolours from Parkinson's sketches. Banks had plans to publish his entire collection as \\"Banks' Florilegium\\", but for various reasons the project was never completed, and it would be ten years before any of the Banksia species were formally published. By this time, a sixth species had been collected; in 1776, during Cook's third voyage, David Nelson collected specimens of B. marginata (Silver Banksia) from South Bruny Island, Tasmania. The genus Banksia was finally described and named by Carolus Linnaeus the Younger in his April 1782 publication Supplementum Plantarum; hence the full name for the genus is \\"Banksia L.f.\\". Linnaeus placed the genus in class Tetrandra, order Monogynia of his father's classification, and named it in honour of Banks. The name Banksia had in fact already been published in 1775 as Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst, referring to some New Zealand species that the Forsters had collected during Cook's second voyage. However Linnaeus incorrectly attributed the Forsters' specimens to the genus Passerina, and therefore considered the name Banksia available for use. By the time Joseph Gaertner corrected Banks' error in 1788, Banksia L.f. was widely known and accepted, so Gaertner renamed Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst to Pimelea, a name previously chosen for the genus by Banks and Solander. Banksia L.f. has since been challenged a number of times. The later near-homonym Banksea Koenig was published in 1783, but subsequently determined to be a synonym of Costus L. In 1790 James Bruce published Bankesia Bruce, later corrected to Banksia Bruce, but the name was rejected in favour of Johann Friedrich Gmelin's name Hagenia. In 1820 the name Banksia Dombey ex DC. was published, but this was later determined by be a nomen nudum that referred to the genus Cuphea, In 1891, Otto Kuntze proposed to enforce the right of precedent of Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst, renaming Pimelea to Banksia, and proposing the name Sirmuellera Kuntze in place of Banksia L.f. This challenge failed, as did James Britten's 1905 challenge. In 1940, Banksia L.f. was formally conserved against Banksia J.R.Forst. & G.Forst by Thomas Sprague. In 1810, Robert Brown published descriptions and a taxonomic arrangement of the 31 known species of Banksia in his Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. He placed B. ilicifolia alone in subgenus Isostylis, in recognition of its unusual dome-shaped inflorescence. All other species were placed in subgenus Banksia verae, the \\"True Banksias\\". Brown made no attempt to classify the species below the subgenus level. He described another eleven Banksia species in his 1830 supplement, placing them all in Banksia verae in accordance with his 1810 classification. Banksia verae was renamed Eubanksia by Stephan Endlicher in 1847. By the time Carl Meissner published his 1856 classification of the Proteaceae, there were 58 described Banksia species. Meissner's arrangement gave Isostylis and Eubanksia sectional rank, and divided the latter into four series based on leaf properties; these series were all highly heterogeneous. George Bentham published his arrangement of the Banksia in his landmark 1870 publication Flora Australiensis. The number of recognised Banksia species was reduced to 46, and Meissner's four heterogeneous series were replaced by four sections based on leaf, style and pollen-presenter characters, taking the number of sections to five. Three of these sections were fairly well-defined and homogeneous, while another, Orthostylis, was somewhat heterogeneous. The fourth, Cyrtostylis, was erected to contain the species that did not belong in the other sections, and was therefore highly heterogeneous. Despite these shortcomings, this arrangement would stand for over 100 years. Classification and relationships within Proteaceae The former genus Dryandra was mereged into the Banksia in 2007. (Banksia ser. dryandra sessilis pictured). The framework for classification of genera within Proteaceae was laid by L. A. S. Johnson and Barbara Briggs in their influential 1975 monograph \\"On the Proteaceae: the evolution and classification of a southern family\\". Their arrangement has been refined somewhat over the ensuing three decades, most notably by Peter H. Weston and Nigel Barker in 2006. Proteaceae is divided into five subfamilies, with Banksia placed in subfamily Grevilleoideae because the individual flowers in its inflorescence occur in pairs. On the basis of certain characters of the leaf venation, hairs and pollen, it is grouped with three other genera in the tribe Banksieae. Two small genera, Austromuellera and Musgravea, both of which occur only in the rainforests of Queensland, are placed in subtribe Musgraveinae. Banksia is placed subtribe Banksiinae on a number of grounds of which the most obvious and easily recognised is the occurrence of flowers in condensed heads. The placement of Banksia in Proteaceae can be summarised as follows: :Family Proteaceae ::Subfamily Bellendenoideae ::Subfamily Persoonioideae ::Subfamily Symphionematoideae ::Subfamily Proteoideae ::Subfamily Grevilleoideae :::Tribe Roupalae :::Tribe Banksieae ::::Subtribe Musgraveinae ::::Subtribe Banksiinae :::::Genus Banksia :::Tribe Embothrieae :::Tribe Macadamieae Although the taxonomic legitimacy of tribe Banksiinae is universally recognised, there has been some debate about the legitimacy of the tribe's resolution into genera Banksia and Dryandra. For a number of years this debate centred on similarities between the inflorescences of Banksia subg. Isostylis species and those of Dryandra. These similarities led to calls for the genera to be merged, or for Isostylis to be moved across to Dryandra. However, Alex George and other supporters of the status quo argued that the similarities between Isostylis and Dryandra were matters of superficial appearance, whereas similarities between Isostylis and other Banksia species were far more important diagnostically. Recent DNA analyses led by Austin Mast have confirmed George's position that Dryandra and Isostylis are not especially closely related, but have also provided powerful evidence that Banksia is paraphyletic with respect to Dryandra (that is, Dryandra is a sub-group of Banksia. Mast suggested that the least disruptive approach to restore monophyly would be to sink Dryandra into Banksia. This has been put into effect in a 2007 paper by Mast & Thiele, in which all existing species of Dryandra were transferred into Banksia. Classical taxonomic treatment B. ericifolia is placed in section Oncostylis on the basis of its hooked styles, which can be seen clearly here. In 1981, Alex George published his classic 1981 monograph The Genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae). George's arrangement was based on a variety of properties including leaf, style, pollen-presenter, follicle and seed characters, with the criterion that a taxon was considered a distinct species only if it exhibited a \\"significant and consistent difference in the morphology of flowers and/or fruit\\". It was the first thorough revision of the taxonomy of Banksia for over a century, and formed the basis for George's 1984 The Banksia Book, which remains the standard text on the genus, and the treatment of Banksia in the Flora of Australia series. George followed Brown in dividing Banksia into two subgenera, Banksia and Isostylis. He then divided subgenus Banksia into two sections: Banksia for species with straight or slightly curved styles, and Oncostylis for species with hooked styles. These two sections were then divided into nine and three series respectively. The arrangement into series largely followed Bentham, with series Orthostylis remaining somewhat heterogeneous, and Cyrtostylis remaining highly heterogeneous. This conventional taxonomic arrangement of Banksia, as provided by George and published in the Flora of Australia series, may be summarised as follows: :Genus Banksia ::Subgenus Banksia :::Section Banksia ::::Series Salicinae :::::Subseries Acclives ::::::B. dentata ‚Äì B. plagiocarpa ‚Äì B. oblongifolia ‚Äì B. robur :::::Subseries Integrifoliae :::::: B. aquilonia ‚Äì B. integrifolia ‚Äì B. conferta ‚Äì B. paludosa ‚Äì B. marginata ‚Äì B. canei ‚Äì B. saxicola ::::Series Grandes :::::B. grandis ‚Äì B. solandri ::::Series Banksia :::::Subseries Banksia ::::::B. serrata ‚Äì B. aemula ‚Äì B. ornata :::::Subseries Cratistylis ::::::B. baxteri ‚Äì B. speciosa ‚Äì B. menziesii ‚Äì B. candolleana ‚Äì B. sceptrum ::::Series Crocinae :::::B. prionotes ‚Äì B. burdettii ‚Äì B. hookeriana ‚Äì B. victoriae ::::Series Prostratae :::::B. goodii ‚Äì B. gardneri ‚Äì B. chamaephyton ‚Äì B. blechnifolia ‚Äì B. repens ‚Äì B. petiolaris ::::Series Cyrtostylis :::::B. media ‚Äì B. praemorsa ‚Äì B. epica ‚Äì B. pilostylis ‚Äì B. attenuata ‚Äì B. ashbyi ‚Äì B. benthamiana ‚Äì B. audax ‚Äì B. lullfitzii ‚Äì B. elderiana ‚Äì B. laevigata ‚Äì B. elegans ‚Äì B. lindleyana ::::Series Tetragonae :::::B. lemanniana ‚Äì B. caleyi ‚Äì B. aculeata ::::Series Bauerinae :::::B. baueri ::::Series Quercinae :::::B. quercifolia ‚Äì B. oreophila :::Section Coccinea :::::B. coccinea :::Section Oncostylis ::::Series Spicigerae :::::Subseries Spinulosae ::::::B. spinulosa :::::Subseries Ericifoliae ::::::B. ericifolia ::::: Subseries Occidentales ::::::B. verticillata ‚Äì B. seminuda ‚Äì B. littoralis ‚Äì B. occidentalis ‚Äì B. brownii ::::Series Tricuspidae :::::B. tricuspis ::::Series Dryandroidae :::::B. dryandroides ::::Series Abietinae :::::Subseries Nutantes ::::::B. nutans :::::Subseries Sphaerocarpae ::::::B. sphaerocarpa ‚Äì B. micrantha ‚Äì B. grossa :::::Subseries Leptophyllae ::::::B. telmatiaea ‚Äì B. leptophylla ‚Äì B. lanata ‚Äì B. scabrella :::::Subseries Longistyles ::::::B. violacea ‚Äì B. incana ‚Äì B. laricina ‚Äì B. pulchella ‚Äì B. meisneri ::Subgenus Isostylis :::::B. ilicifolia ‚Äì B. oligantha ‚Äì B. cuneata Cladistic analyses =Thiele and Ladiges= In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published a cladistic analysis of the genus Banksia in the journal Australian Systematic Botany. As their cladogram differed substantially from the current taxonomic arrangement, they published a revised arrangement that accorded better with their results. Four varieties were promoted to species rank: B. conferta var. penicillata to B. penicillata (now B. conferta subsp. penicillata); B. gardneri var. brevidentata to B. brevidentata; B. gardneri var. hiemalis to B. hiemalis; and B. sphaerocarpa var. dolichostyla to B. dolichostyla. Two new series and eleven subseries were introduced; Banksia sect. Oncostylis and Banksia ser. Crocinae were discarded; and Banksia ser. Cyrtostylis was largely redefined. Six species were left incertae sedis. Most aspects of Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement were not accepted by George in his 1999 revision. He stated that \\"the infrageneric classification and systematic sequence presented here are modified from that of George (1981) and take into account new data revealed in the work of Thiele & Ladiges (1996)\\", but none of the four promotions to species rank was accepted, and none of the thirteen infrageneric taxa introduced by Thiele and Ladiges was retained. However, a number of Australian herbaria have continued to follow Thiele and Ladiges on some points, for example by recognising the four species that they promoted. =DNA analysis= Following on from an earlier molecular study,Mast, Austin R. (1998) Molecular systematics of subtribe Banksiinae (Banksia and Dryandra; Proteaceae) based on cpDNA and nrDNA sequence data: implications for taxonomy and biogeography. Australian Systematic Botany 11: 321‚Äì342 Austin Mast and co-authors published cladistic analyses of genetic data from DNA samples of almost all species of Banksia, along with five Dryandra species, in 2002 and 2005. Their results indicated the presence of two large clades of Banksia, which they named \\"/Cryptostomata\\" (\\"hidden stomates\\") and \\"/Phanerostomata\\" (\\"visible stomates\\"). The /Phanerostomata were defined as those taxa in which the leaf stomata occur superficially or in shallow pits. These taxa are typically tall shrubs and trees that occur in moist areas; they have unbeaked follicles and soft, short- lived leaves that are in many cases needle-like. The clade includes all eastern taxa of the series Salicinae and Spicigerae (that is, all taxa except B. serrata, B. aemula and B. ornata) and also the western Spicigerae, Quercinae, Grandes, Abietinae and Dryandroideae. The /Cryptostomata were defined as those taxa in which the leaf stomata occur in crypts with constricted entrances. These are usually small shrubs that occur on dry, infertile sandplains. They have beaked follicles and thick, tough, long-lived serrated leaves. It includes all other western taxa, plus the eastern species B. serrata, B. aemula and B. ornata, and also appears to include Dryandra. It is worth noting that Dryandra does not appear especially closely related to the Isostylis group, which is instead most closely related to B. elegans and then B. attenuata. Thus, the results presented by Mast et al. strongly suggest that Banksia is paraphyletic with respect to Dryandra. Although they did not propose a new taxonomic arrangement, they did consider various options for adjusting the current accepted arrangement to remove the paraphyly. They conclude that the simplest and least disruptive solution would be to merge Dryandra into Banksia. This solution was put into effect in a subsequent paper by Mast & Thiele. The change has been adopted by a number of Australian herbaria including the Western Australian Herbarium, now headed by Thiele (this has the largest holdings of specimens), and by the Australian Plant Census, a project of the Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria. This is in accordance with majority current taxonomic practice, in which only holophyletic groups are named as taxa, and groups found to be paraphyletic (e.g. Banksia not including Dryandra) are adjusted to achieve a holophyletic naming system. Alex George maintains a firm position against the change, arguing variously that the phylogenetic analyses are flawed and that paraphyly does not necessitate taxonomic changes.

He also studied with the leading players of three different schools; Yang Zongji (1865‚Äì1933), the leading player in Beijing, the Daoist Qin Heming, and the Buddhist monk Wucheng. Before 1949, Guan did some teaching at the Yenching University, but had most of his meager income from selling paintings and repairing old musical instruments and furniture. In 1952, he became a teacher and assistant researcher at the Zhongyang Yinyue Xueyuan (Central Conservatory of Music) and a leading force at the Beijing Guqin Yanjiuhui (Beijing Guqin Research Institute), both in Beijing. He also recreated and performed many pieces, including Guangling San (), Youlan („ÄäÁ¢£Áü≥Ë™øÂπΩËò≠„Äã- Secluded Orchid), and Hujia Shiba Pai („ÄäËÉ°Á¨≥ÂçÅÂÖ´Êãç„Äã ‚Äì Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute), that only existed as notation through a process known as dapu ().Dapu These pieces have become part of the core repertory of guqin music. Though he trained few prominent students, Guan's numerous recordings ‚Äì notable for their austerity, subtlety, and bold presentation ‚Äì have exerted wide and continuing influence. In 1977, a recording of \\"Liu Shui\\" (ÊµÅÊ∞¥; Stream), as performed by Guan, was chosen to be included in the Voyager Golden Record, a gold-plated LP recording containing music from around the world, which was sent into outer space by NASA on the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft. It is the longest excerpt included on the disc (lasting seven minutes and 37 seconds) and the only excerpt of Chinese music.

Background Maxwell Alan Lerner was born on December 20, 1902 in Minsk, in the Russian Empire, the son of Bessie (Podel) and Benjamin Lerner. His Russian Jewish family emigrated to the U.S. in 1907, where his father sold milk door to door.Severo, Richard (June 6, 1992). Max Lerner, Writer, 89, Is Dead; Humanist on Political Barricades.

He earned a doctorate from the Brookings Institution in 1927. Career Once out of school, Lerner began work as an editor for the Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences (1927‚Äì32), The Nation (1936‚Äì38), and PM (1943‚Äì48). After PM sold, he continued as a contributor to its short-lived successor, the New York Star (ended 1949). His column for the New York Post debuted in 1949. It earned him a place on the master list of Nixon political opponents. During most of his career he was considered a liberal. In his later years, however, he was seen as something of a conservative since he expressed support for Margaret Thatcher and the Reagan administration. He taught at Sarah Lawrence College, Harvard University, Williams College, United States International University, the University of Notre Dame, and Brandeis University.

Established in 1963 as the U.S. Gymnastics Federation (USGF), USA Gymnastics is responsible for selecting and training national teams for the Olympic Games and World Championships. The mission of USA Gymnastics is to encourage participation and the pursuit of excellence in all aspects of gymnastics. The programs governed by USAG are: * Women's Artistic Gymnastics (WAG) * Men's Artistic Gymnastics (MAG) * Rhythmic Gymnastics * Trampoline & Tumbling (T&T;) * Acrobatic Gymnastics * Aerobic Gymnastics (designated as discipline of gymnastics by the international body, the FIG) * Group Gymnastics / Gymnastics for All The Women's Artistic program‚Äîcomprising the events vault, uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise‚Äîhas become well known through holding several nationally televised competitions each year. Events in the Men's Artistic program include floor exercise, pommel horse, still rings, vault, parallel bars, and horizontal bar. On November 5, 2018, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) announced that it was starting the process to decertify USAG as the national governing body for gymnastics at the Olympic level. This followed investigations and prosecutions related to two decades of widespread sexual abuse by coaches, gyms, and other elements overseen by USAG, a scandal first reported in 2016. One month later, USAG filed for bankruptcy. Women's Artistic programs =Elite Program= The Elite Program consists of regional and national training programs and competitions designed for athletes aspiring to represent the United States in international competition. Athletes participate at Developmental, Open, Pre-Elite, and National Team training camps. Only athletes at the National Team level are called \\"elite gymnasts\\". There are two Elite groups: Junior Elite (ages 11-15) and Senior Elite (ages 16+). In 2016 Valeri Liukin, a former Soviet Olympic medalist and owner of World Olympic Gymnastics Academy, replaced Marta Karolyi as USA Gymnastics women's national team coordinator. Liukin resigned from the position in the aftermath of the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal. Annual elite-level competitions include the American Cup, U.S. Classic, and U.S. Championships, as well as multiple National Qualifying Meets throughout the year. Junior and Senior National Teams are selected based on performance at the U.S. Championships. These athletes then compete at the World Championships. In Olympic years, elite gymnasts compete at the Summer Olympics. In order to get to the elite level, a gymnast must pass both the elite compulsory and optional qualifiers. In elite compulsory qualifiers, gymnasts compete a basic routine designed by organizers to demonstrate that the gymnast has all the basic skills, including twists, handsprings, jumps, leaps, kips to cast handstand, giants, turns, and more. In elite optionals, the gymnast is evaluated for advanced skills and moves, such as pak saltos, releases, complex dismounts, multiple tucks/twists, double layouts, twisting vaults, and more. In optionals, gymnasts create their own routines. =Talent Opportunity Program= The Talent Opportunity Program (TOPs) seeks to identify talented female gymnasts aged 7‚Äì10 for further training up to the elite level. State and regional evaluations are followed by a national test of physical abilities and basic gymnastics skills in October of each year. This is followed by a national training camp in December for those who qualify. =Olympics Hopefuls program= The Olympics Hopefuls program (HOPEs) is a program to identify talented gymnasts, generally aged 8-12, and train them to an advanced level. In order to qualify for HOPEs, a gymnast must pass both the elite compulsory and optional qualifiers, and get a certain minimum score. HOPEs Elite gymnasts compete at elite meets, but not as a Junior Elite. =Junior Olympic Program= The Junior Olympic Program provides training, evaluation, and competition opportunities to allow developing gymnasts to safely advance at their own pace through specific skill levels. Most competitive gymnasts advance through this system. As of August 1, 2013, the levels are as follows. * Developmental levels 1‚Äì2: the most fundamental skills performed in a non-competitive, achievement-oriented environment * Compulsory levels 3‚Äì5: progressively difficult skills performed competitively as standardized routines (all gymnasts at a given level perform the same routines) * Optional levels 6‚Äì10: progressively difficult skills performed competitively in original routines Skills are grouped by degree of difficulty and given the letter ratings A‚ÄìE, with A denoting the easiest skills. Levels 6‚Äì8 have difficulty restrictions, in that a gymnast competing at one of these levels may not attempt skills above a certain level of difficulty (for example, level 6 and 7 gymnasts may only include A and B skills in their routines). Levels 9 and 10 have no such difficulty restrictions, although level 9 gymnasts may include only one D or E skill in any single routine. In addition to demonstrating the necessary skills, gymnasts must reach a minimum age to advance to the next level. For example, level 8 and 9 gymnasts must be at least 8 years old; level 10 gymnasts must be at least 9 years old. Regardless of age, all beginning gymnasts enter the program at level 1 and may advance through more than one level per year. Competitions for gymnasts at level 7 culminate in State Championships, level 8 at Regional Championships, level 9 at Eastern or Western Championships, and level 10 at Junior Olympic National Championships. Prior to August 1, 2013, the developmental levels were numbered 1‚Äì4, the compulsory levels 5‚Äì6, and the optional levels 7‚Äì10. The old levels 1 and 2 have been combined into the new level 1; level 7 has been split into the new levels 6 and 7; and the numbering of levels 3‚Äì6 have each been shifted down one level for the new system. =Xcel Program= The Xcel Program provides training and competition experience for gymnasts outside of the traditional Junior Olympic program. Its stated purpose is \\"to provide gymnasts of varying abilities and commitment levels, the opportunity for a rewarding gymnastics experience.\\" Participants compete in individual and team competitions in Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond divisions, based on age and ability level.  National teams  * United States women's national gymnastics team ‚Äì Founded in 1982 * United States men's national gymnastics team ‚Äì Founded in 1998  Sex abuse of gymnasts  In 2018, Larry Nassar, who was the national team doctor through four Olympic cycles, pleaded guilty to sexually abusing female athletes, including Olympic gold medalists Aly Raisman and Jordyn Wieber. Following his sentencing, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) threatened to decertify USA Gymnastics unless the entire board resigned. USA Gymnastics complied and all 21 board members resigned on January 26. Olympic medalist McKayla Maroney has filed a lawsuit alleging the USA Gymnastics paid her to keep silent about Nassar's abuse. Gymnasts have called for those who protected Nassar, including the USOC and USA Gymnastics, to be held accountable for their actions. In 2016, a former federal prosecutor was commissioned by USA Gymnastics to develop recommendations to reform its policies related to sexual misconduct; his report included 70 recommendations.Report to USA Gymnastics on Proposed Policy and Procedural Changes Among these was removing the \\"athlete representative\\" from the Olympic selection committee so athletes would be less afraid to report abuses. USA Gymnastics cut ties with the Karolyi Ranch in the wake of the scandal, after several gymnasts said they had been abused by Nassar on the premises. The ranch, operated by B√©la K√°rolyi and his wife, former national team coordinator M√°rta K√°rolyi, had been the official US Women's National Team Training Center since 2001. On November 5, 2018, the USOC announced that it was starting the process to decertify USAG as the national governing body for gymnastics in the United States. One month later, USA Gymnastics filed for bankruptcy.

Though he made only two feature films and five short films, they received international acclaim for their original and experimental cinematic technique and non-linear, unconventional narrative style. Born to a Muslim family near Dakar, Senegal's capital city, Mamb√©ty was Wolof. He died in 1998 while being treated for lung cancer in a Paris hospital.  Overview  The son of a Muslim cleric and member of the Lebou tribe, Djibril Diop Mamb√©ty was born near Senegal's capital city of Dakar in Colobane, a town featured prominently in some of his films. Mamb√©ty's interest in cinema began with theater. Having graduated from acting school in Senegal, Mamb√©ty worked as a stage actor at the Daniel Sorano National Theater in Dakar until he was expelled for disciplinary reasons. In 1969, at age 23, without any formal training in filmmaking, Mamb√©ty directed and produced his first short film, Contras' City (City of Contrasts). The following year Mamb√©ty made another short, Badou Boy, which won the Silver Tanit award at the 1970 Carthage Film Festival in Tunisia. Mamb√©ty's technically sophisticated and richly symbolic first feature-length film, Touki Bouki (1973), received the International Critics Award at Cannes Film Festival and won the Special Jury Award at the Moscow Film Festival, bringing the Senegalese director international attention and acclaim. Despite the film's success, twenty years passed before Mamb√©ty made another feature film. During this hiatus he made one short film in 1989, Parlons Grandm√®re (Let's talk Grandmother). Hy√®nes (1992), Mamb√©ty's second and final feature film, was an adaptation of Friedrich D√ºrrenmatt's play The Visit and was conceptualized as a continuation of Touki Bouki. At the time of his death, the film director had been working on a trilogy of short films called Contes des Petites Gens (Tales of the Little People). The first of the three films was Le Franc (1994). At the time of his death Mamb√©ty had been editing the second film of that series, La Petite Vendeuse de Soleil (The Little Girl Who Sold the Sun), which premiered posthumously in 1999. His early death to lung cancer, at age 53, occurred in a Paris hospital. He was the subject of a 2008 documentary film Mamb√©ty For Ever.  Film career  = Cinematic style, themes, and politics = The notion of hybridity is a theme that runs through many of Djibril Diop Mamb√©ty films. Like many of his contemporaries, Djibril Diop Mamb√©ty used the cinematic medium to comment on political and social conditions in Africa. As critiques of neocolonialism, like those of Ousmane Semb√®ne and Souleymane Ciss√©, Mamb√©ty's films can similarly be understood in the context of Third Cinema. Yet, his often unconventional, surrealist, fast-paced, non-linear style distinguishes Mamb√©ty from other prominent filmmakers of Francophone African Cinema who employed more traditional didactic, social realist narratives. African Studies scholar Sheila Petty notes, \\"unlike other African filmmakers of the late 1960s and early 1970s whose films were structured around essentialist nationalist discourse focused on the binary opposition of African values versus cultural alienation, Mamb√©ty sought to expose the diversity of real life\\". According to critics like Petty, his films were an expression of an African sensibility neither locked into narrow nationalism nor into colonial French culture. Instead of rejecting or elevating one as more or less authentically African, Mamb√©ty confronted and engaged with postindependent Africa's complexities and contradictions. Montage sequences in his films that are overflowing with symbols and sounds of traditional and modern Africa, as well as contemporary European culture, depict hybridity. In addition, his own editing and narrative style are a confluence of the ancient griotic tradition of tribal storytelling and modern avant-garde techniques. Mamb√©ty was interested in transforming conflicting, mixed elements into a usable African culture, and in his words, \\"reinvent[ing] cinema\\". Other common thematic concerns in Mamb√©ty's films are power, wealth and delusion. Offering a cynical view of humanity in his last feature-length film, Hy√®nes, Mamb√©ty implicates Africans themselves for a continuing dependency on the West. Through the film and in many interviews, the director suggests that Africans are short-sighted in looking to the colonial past for their future, and are misled by their unrestrained desires for material goods that ensure Africa's dependency on foreign aid. Ultimately, however, Mamb√©ty transmitted a message of hopefulness in his final films, which elevate the \\"little people,\\" as the bearers of a positive and new Africa. \\"The only truly consistent, unaffected people in the world,\\" Mamb√©ty once said of the marginalized, \\"for whom every morning brings the same question: how to preserve what is essential to themselves\\". Vlad Dima, a professor of French studies, describes Mamb√©ty's alternation \\"between synchronous and asynchronous sound\\" in his films as a way for viewers to move from a \\"visual plane\\" to an \\"aural narrative\\" plane. Dima provides an example of this technique as seen in the opening scene of Contras'city when French classical music accompanies the visual of the French- style Dakar City Hall building; it is then interrupted by the Senegalese flag, a disruption of the music, and a voiceover of someone saying \\"Dakar.\\"  Quotes  \\"Cinema is magic in the service of dreams.\\" \\"The word griot...is the word for what I do and the role that the filmmaker has in society...the griot is a messenger of one's time, a visionary and the creator of the future.\\" (Africa Shoots Back) \\"One has to choose between engaging in stylistic research or the mere recording of facts. I feel that a filmmaker must go beyond the recording of facts. Moreover, I believe that Africans, in particular, must reinvent cinema. It will be a difficult task because our viewing audience is used to a specific film language, but a choice has to be made: either one is very popular and one talks to people in a simple and plain manner, or else one searches for an African film language that would exclude chattering and focus more on how to make use of visuals and sounds.\\" \\"Birds know what god is like. They are nearer than Hyenas to god. They are like some kind of elephant whose wings flow in the wind, and African Film makers can be birds for reinventing the seventh art. We are perhaps poor in money but so rich by situation and hope\\".  Filmography  *Contras'city (1968) *Badou Boy (1970) *Touki Bouki/The Journey of the Hyena (1973), International Critic's Prize at Cannes and Special Jury Prize Moscow Film Festival *Parlons Grand-m√®re (Let's talk Grandmother) (1989) *Hy√®nes (1992) *Le Franc (1994) *La Petite Vendeuse de Soleil (1999) = Contras'city = Djibril Diop Mamb√©ty's earliest film, a short entitled Contras'city (1968), highlighted the contrasts of cosmopolitanism and unrestrained ostentation in Dakar's baroque architecture against the modest, everyday lives of the Senegalese. Mamb√©ty's recurrent theme of hybridity‚Äîthe blending of elements from precolonial Africa and the colonial West in a neocolonial African context--is already evident in Contras'city, which is considered Africa's first comedy film. = Badou Boy = In 1970 Mamb√©ty released his next short, Badou Boy, another sarcastic look at Senegal's capital that followed the adventures of what the director described as a \\"somewhat immoral street urchin who is very much like myself\\". The contest pits the non-conformist individual against an absurdly caricatured policeman who pursues the protagonist through comedically improbable scenarios. Badou Boy celebrates an urban subculture while parodying the state. = Touki Bouki = Considered by many to be his most daring and important film, Mamb√©ty's feature-length debut, Touki Bouki (The Hyena's Journey) more fully developed his earlier themes of hybridity and individual marginality and isolation. Based on his own story and script, Djibril Diop Mamb√©ty made Touki Bouki with a budget of $30,000‚Äîobtained in part from the Senegalese government. Though influenced by French New Wave, Touki Bouki displays a style all its own. Its camerawork and soundtrack have a frenetic rhythm uncharacteristic of most African films‚Äîknown for their often deliberately slow-paced, linearly evolving narratives. Through jump cuts, colliding montage, dissonant sonic accompaniment, and the juxtaposition of premodern, pastoral and modern sounds and visual elements, Touki Bouki conveys and grapples with the hybridization of Senegal. A pair of lovers, Mory and Anta, fantasize about fleeing Dakar for a mythic and romanticized France. The film follows them as they try to scavenge and hustle the funds for their escape. They both make it to the steamliner that would transport them to Paris, but before it disembarks, Mory is drawn back to Dakar and cannot succumb to the seduction of the West. Touki Bouki won the Special Jury Award at the Moscow film Festival and the International Critics Award at Cannes. * Touki Bouki ranked #52 in Empire magazines \\"The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema\\" in 2010. = Hy√®nes = An African adaptation of Friedrich D√ºrrenmatt's famous Swiss play, The Visit, Hy√®nes (Hyenas) tells the story of Linguere Ramatou, an aging, wealthy woman who revisits her home village‚Äîand Mamb√©ty's‚Äîof Colobane. Linguere offers a disturbing proposition to the people of Colobane and lavishes luxuries upon them to persuade them. This embittered woman, \\"as rich as the World Bank,\\" will bestow upon Colobane a fortune in exchange for the murder of Dramaan Drameh, a local shopkeeper who abandoned her after a love affair and her illegitimate pregnancy when she was 16. The intimate story of love and revenge between Linguere and Dramaan parallels a critique of neocolonialism and African consumerism. Mamb√©ty once said, \\"We have sold our souls too cheaply. We are done for if we have traded our souls for money\\" Although its characters are distinct, Mamb√©ty considered Hy√®nes to be a continuation of Touki Bouki and a further exploration of its themes of power and insanity. Wasis Diop, younger brother of Djibril Diop Mamb√©ty, is responsible for the film's soundtrack. The film is distributed by California Newsreel Productions. = Le Franc = This first film in Mamb√©ty's uncompleted trilogy, Contes des Petites Gens (Tales of Little People), Le Franc (1994) uses the French government's devaluation of the CFA Franc to comment on the absurd schemes people concoct to survive a system that rewards greed rather than merit. The film features a poor musician, Marigo, who finds solace in playing his congoma, which has been confiscated because of his debt. Marigo plays the lottery, and despite winning, encounters obstacles to claiming the reward. The film is both slapstick and symbolic of the lottery-style luck that benefits some and hampers others in the global economy. Le Franc is part of the project, Three Tales from Senegal which also includes \\"Picc Mi\\" (Little Bird) and \\"Fary l'anesse\\" (Fary the Donkey). The film is distributed by California Newsreel Productions. = La Petite Vendeuse de Soleil = As the second installment in Mamb√©ty's trilogy exalting the lives and promise found among ordinary Senegalese, the 45-minute film, La Petite Vendeuse de Soleil (The Little Girl Who Sold the Sun) depicts a young beggar girl, Sili, who on crutches, confidently makes her way through a city of obstacles, evading a group of bullies, and selling newspapers to make money for herself and her blind grandmother. Mamb√©ty dedicates his last film to \\"the courage of street children\\". His luminous main character, Sili, manages to make this a sympathetic and optimistic look at the struggle and potential of Africa's most oppressed‚Äîyoung, female, poor, disabled. The movie is accompanied by a score by Mamb√©ty's brother, Wasis Diop. This film was selected as one of the ten best films of 2000 by the Village Voice. Reviewer for The New York Times, A.O. Scott described the film as a \\"masterpiece of understated humanity.\\"  Personal life  Mamb√©ty was the older brother of musician Wasis Diop and the uncle of actress and director Mati Diop, Wasis Diop's daughter. He was the father of Teemour Diop mambety and soon to be grandfather of Malayka mambety Diop.

Clayton Fritchey was born in 1904 in Bellefontaine, Ohio. At the age of 2 he moved to Baltimore. His reporting career began at age 19 and by age 21 he had become the managing editor of The Baltimore Post. In later years he was a nationally syndicated columnist. The New York Times in their obituary for Fritchey noted the exciting stories he wrote for the Cleveland Press, detailing the exploits of Eliot Ness, who was brought into Cleveland as its public safety director to help clean up corruption in the police department. During his time in New Orleans as editor of the New Orleans Item, he defended an editorial that stated \\"Louisiana legislators 'have about as much independence as trained seals'\\". The Louisiana legislature convened a committee to investigate if they had been \\"disrespected\\" by Mr. Fritchey. He was editor of the New Orleans Item when George C. Marshall asked him to become the Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs in 1950. He served as Assistant to the Secretary of Defense and Director of the Office of Public Information, Dept. of Defense, 1950‚Äì52; Assistant to the President of the United States, 1952 (President Harry Truman); and Deputy Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, 1953-57.

Wechsler (October 31, 1915 - September 11, 1983) was an American journalist who worked as a newspaper columnist, Washington bureau chief, editor-in-chief, and editorial page editor of The New York Post. He was a prominent voice of American liberalism for 40 years and was considered one of the most highly informed and responsible political writers in Washington. Early life Born on October 31, 1915, he entered Columbia University when he was just shy of 16. Wechsler graduated in 1935 after rising to editor-in- chief of the Columbia Daily Spectator. In his first year, he attended a speech by Columbia President Nicholas Murray Butler, who said that democracies are incapable of choosing strong leaders like totalitarian nations could, which shocked him. He was shocked again when his friend Reed Harris was fired as editor of the Spectator for criticizing the professionalization of college football. Career Between 1934 and 1937, Wechsler belonged to the Young Communist League and was a leader of the pro-Communist American Student Union. He left the League after \\"an eye-opening trip to the Soviet Union.\\"Moynihan, Michael McCarthy and His Friends, Reason He publicly condemned the 1939 Hitler-Stalin pact and was repeatedly attacked by official Communist organs. From 1942 to 1946, except for one year in the US Army, Wechsler was national editor of the newspaper PM. In May 1949, at 33, Wechsler became the editor of The New York Post and, in an unusual arrangement, he was in charge of both the news operation and the editorial page. The Post then became known as a crusading liberal newspaper, undertaking investigate expos√©s of figures like J. Edgar Hoover, Walter Winchell, and Robert Moses. In September 1952, the paper published a story about a fund financed by wealthy California businessmen to supplement Senator Richard Nixon's office expenses that led Nixon to respond in his famous televised Checkers speech during his successful quest for the vice-presidency. In 1961, Wechsler was shifted to the position of editorial page editor after being replaced as editor of the news section by Paul Sann; he held that position until 1980. Besides editorials, Wechsler also wrote a regular column, which continued until shortly before his death. Opposed by McCarthy and Nixon Senator Joseph McCarthy questioned his conversion to anticommunism. Wechsler testified before McCarthy's committee in 1953 on his past adherence to communism and named other party members.James Wechsler: The Editor Who Dared Challenge J.

The Shamokin Valley Railroad is a short line railroad that operates 27 miles of track in southern Northumberland County, Pennsylvania in the United States. It is part of the North Shore Railroad System. The line runs generally southeast between Sunbury and the unincorporated village of Mount Carmel Junction (just east of the borough of Mount Carmel in Mount Carmel Township). Other communities served include the villages of Paxinos (in Shamokin Township) and Weigh Scales (in Ralpho Township), and the city of Shamokin. The rail line runs east from Sunbury, then turns south through Paxinos and Weigh Scales to Shamokin, where it turns east again, always along or near Shamokin Creek and roughly following the route of Pennsylvania Route 61. It interchanges with the Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad in Locust Summit. The corporate offices are located in Northumberland, Pennsylvania. There is a connection to the Norfolk Southern Railway at Sunbury. The system has trackage rights via the Norfolk Southern line. These allow the Shamokin Valley Railroad to connect to the north and west with the North Shore Railroad (at Northumberland), the Union County Industrial Railroad (at Milton), the Lycoming Valley Railroad at Muncy and the village of Linden (in Woodward Township, Lycoming County, and to the Nittany and Bald Eagle Railroad at Lock Haven.  History  The line operated by the Shamokin Valley Railroad was formerly part of Conrail. SEDA-COG JRA (Susquehanna Economic Development Association - Council of Governments Joint Rail Authority) was formed in July, 1983 to continue to provide rail service to communities whose rail lines Conrail had decided to abandon. In 1989 the JRA took over the line when Conrail abandoned it, and the Shamokin Valley Railroad was born as its third railroad.

They were funded and distributed entirely by the band Switchfoot with help from E.E. Kennedy for the first one and Andy Barron for the second. Switchfootage Switchfootage is the 30-minute documentary written, funded, and distributed entirely by the band Switchfoot. The film is directed and edited by both the band members and their USC film school friend and film-maker, Elizabeth Kennedy (credited as E.E. Kennedy). Despite its short runtime, the film took the band nearly 8 years to create as they steadily pushed its release date further and further into the future. The film includes a short film written and directed by Jon Foreman entitled \\"Red Tape\\", film of the band members surfing, skateboarding, and concert footage. Switchfoot was inspired to make a documentary by E.E. Kennedy (who they credit in their thanks as \\"the fire starter\\" at the end of the film) who supplied them with some of the footage for it from her independent documentary, \\"Everything to Lose,\\" filmed from 2000 through 2003. \\"Everything to Lose\\" won \\"Special Mention\\" at the Damah film festival and was an official selection at the Fort Lauderdale and Annapolis Film Festivals. The DVD also features hidden segments of film. One short is footage from the behind-the- scenes filming of their first major music video for \\"Meant to Live\\". The second shows a young Switchfoot (consisting only of Chad Butler and the Foreman brothers) then known as \\"Chin-Up\\" performing in a friend's basement at a party. Eventually this fades into a home video of a very young Jon and Tim Foreman in their Led Zeppelin cover band, \\"Joker's Wild\\", that they formed with their friend from junior high, Todd Cooper. Switchfootage 2 Switchfootage 2 was released for Christmas 2006, and is a continuation of the behind the scenes look at the band Switchfoot that they had started with the original Switchfootage. Most of the filming for Switchfootage 2 was done by photographer Andy Barron who has been touring with the band. Besides behind the scenes stuff similar to the first Switchfootage, the DVD is also includes two previously unreleased music videos from Nothing Is Sound, \\"Happy is a Yuppie Word\\" and \\"The Blues\\".

As of 2012, Greater Tehran had a population of close to 14 million residents.PopulationData.net ‚Äì Iran The 2016 census had the population at 13.3 million in Tehran Province (only 200 thousands of them outside Tehran and the suburban counties) and 2.2 million in Karaj and Fardis combined. This allow to estimate that the population of the urban agglomeration was about 15 million people in 2016, and it is sinking 25 cm per year because of the accelerated influx and the overuse of natural resources.https://www.sciencealert.com/this- city-of-15-million-people-is-sinking-rapidly-and-it-could-be-irreversible Since the 1960s, much of Greater Tehran's growth has been caused by an influx of urban poor into informal settlements on the fringe.Zebardast, E. (2006). Marginalization of the urban poor and the expansion of the spontaneous settlements on the Tehran metropolitan fringe. Cities, 23(6), 439-454. Greater Tehran should not be confused with the following: * Tehran Province (area 18814 km¬≤, population 13.27 m - 2016). Part of the province is too far from Tehran and has too low a population density to be classified as the part of agglomeration * Tehran County (area 1300 km¬≤, population 8.85 million (2016) with 97.5% of the population living in Tehran City itself) * Tehran City includes 22 districts, two of them fully and one partially are located outside of Tehran County. The city's area is about 730 km¬≤. The extension of the city to other counties began in 1973 to include the villages surrounding the city of Tajrish (Evin, Darakeh, Niyavaran, Rostan Abad, Gholhak, Zargandeh, Elahiyeh, Davoudiyeh, Zarrabkhaneh) and the cities of Vanak and Rey to which ‚ÄúKooye Siman‚Äù had been annexed during the years 1956 to 1966.

The two have been portrayed by more than one actor/actress since their inception, but were originally, most recently and most famously portrayed by Matthew Ashford and Melissa Reeves. Fans have nicknamed the couple \\"J&J;\\" or JnJ\\" (for Jack and Jennifer) on internet message boards. For their portrayal of Jack and Jennifer's romance, Ashford and Reeves won Soap Opera Digest Awards for Favorite Supercouple in 1991 and Best Love Story in 1992.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHpJqG5cMbs Storylines =Backstory= Jack Deveraux was the adopted son of Harper Deveraux. Harper was a U.S. Senator, and Jack was an aspiring politician, but it was revealed that Harper was a sociopathic killer. At one point, Jack was a suspect for the killings in town, and it seemed that his father was actually trying to frame him. Unbeknownst to Jack, he was really Billy Johnson, Jo Johnson's son and Steve Johnson's baby brother. Jo had given up her boys for adoption when she feared that her abusive husband Duke would kill them. Young Steve Johnson watched helplessly as his baby brother Billy was adopted and taken from him. Jack was raised in the lap of luxury, but he was not given a very compassionate upbringing. When he came to town, he tried to woo Kayla Brady and when Steve found out Jack was really his brother and that Jack was dying from Hodgkin's disease, he pushed Kayla away and encouraged her to marry dying Jack. Jack recovered, and Kayla was unable to consummate their marriage. Jack felt that Kayla just needed time to get to love him, and he tried to be patient. Kayla became sick when Harper began poisoning her, and Steve saved her life. Steve told Kayla why he had pushed her away and then the two began an affair, with plans to end her marriage to Jack after his election. Jack found out about the affair and was enraged by Kayla's constant rebuffs and promises that she would one day be ready. When he was rebuffed again, he showed her the pictures and then he raped her in a violent rage. In the ensuing months, he descended full-time into his anger and let it shape and define him. Desperate to please his father (who was a sociopathic misogynist), Jack tried to be Harper's son and he worked hard at bringing down the people who had scorned him: Kayla and Steve. He tried to warn Steve away from his wife by having him beat up. Eventually Steve and Jack fought on the rooftop of the loft where Jack had lived with Kayla. Jack fell and almost died, but Steve gave his baby brother a kidney, saving the younger man's life. Eventually Jack found out he was Steve's brother, and he was angry and bitter. He gave Kayla a divorce but still maintained that he was provoked into his attack on her, and refused to call it rape. He plea-bargained to domestic assault when she took him to court, and he continued to harass her whenever he saw her. He claimed he had been railroaded into that plea-bargain. Meanwhile, Melissa Horton, his assistant and Jennifer Horton's cousin, was in love with him. He was encouraged by his stepmother Angelica to use Melissa's feelings for him to try to secure Harper's Senate seat, left empty by Harper's conviction for murder. The other candidate was Melissa's adoptive father, Mickey Horton, and Angelica felt that Melissa's support of Jack would lend strength to his campaign. Melissa saw Jack making romantic plans with another woman on the day of their wedding, and she left him at the altar. Jack's career aspirations as a politician were in shambles, and he spent a great deal of time and energy trying to destroy Mickey Horton's reputation, as well as that of Mickey's nephew and Jennifer's brother: Dr. Mike Horton. Having completely alienated his biological family as well as the Hortons and Bradys, Jack was mostly a social pariah. =1989‚Äì90= Desperate to keep \\"The Spectator\\" from printing an expos√© on his dirty dealings as a politician, Jack purchased a controlling share and changed his destiny. He abandoned his political goals and became a newspaperman. At first, Jack's involvement in the paper was purely intended to squelch the truth, but soon he became caught up in the actual business of reporting the truth. Jennifer was young and fairly inexperienced in the ways of life. Although she had had many puppy-love romances, Jennifer had yet to consummate them, waiting for the \\"right guy\\". Jennifer began a college internship for Jack as a cub-reporter. Her initial feelings towards Jack were unfavorable due to his treatment of Kayla and Melissa, but Jennifer soon learned that her boss had a different side to him. Jennifer refused to let Jack make excuses for the terrible things he had done, and she called him on the carpet whenever he tried to use his newspaper to gratuitously hurt people he didn't care for. She also gently pushed him to try to get closer to his family. Jennifer was dating Emilio Ramirez, a former gang member who had also had some negative dealings with Jack during the days when Jack was actively tormenting Steve and Kayla. Jack started to develop feelings for Jennifer and started half-heartedly pursuing her while trying to throw monkey-wrenches into her relationship with Emilio, who he deemed to be a deadbeat and not good enough for her. Jennifer didn't seem to return those feelings at first, but began to see that Jack wasn't someone she needed to fear and the two formed an odd friendship. Emilio left town after a skirmish involving Adrienne (Jack and Steve's younger sister) and her ex-husband Justin. Emilio, who had slept with Adrienne, had tampered with Justin's car, and although he wasn't sent to jail, Jennifer could not be with someone who would do something like that. Jennifer wanted to foster a baby girl named Hannah after Hannah's mom was convicted of robbery and sent to jail for three years. Ironically, Hannah's mother had committed the crime so that she would have the shelter of prison when giving birth. Jack, who himself felt he had been abandoned by his mother Jo, refused to write an editorial supporting Hannah being with her mother in jail. Jennifer was then injured in the pursuit of a story for the Spectator, and a frantic Jack realized that he was in love with her. He concocted a plan to fake marriage with Jennifer so that Jennifer and he could spend more time together in a more intimate setting. At first, Jennifer was very wary of the idea and point-blank brought up the fact that his track record was lousy and he was very difficult to trust. In the end, she agreed to the plan, but the foster agency refused to give a baby to a man who had assaulted his ex-wife. Jack was hurt by this, but Jennifer was honest with him about how his past made it hard to trust him. Jennifer decided to move into the apartment Jack had rented out to fool the social worker, and with some behind-the-scenes maneuvering by the still-tricky Jack, she ended up fostering the baby for a short while. Jack was adorably endearing helping feed and care for the very young child, and seeing him with the baby made Jennifer develop warmer feelings towards him. Jennifer lost custody when Sally's parents decided to take custody of their granddaughter. Jennifer was furious with Jack for failing to warn her about this when he had known it was happening, but in the end, she turned to him for comfort when she realized he just didn't know how to tell her. Emilio came back to town, and Jennifer ended up getting involved with him again, but by now, Jack was always on her mind. She did not yet realize she loved Jack, but she verbally and emotionally sparred with him in a way that gave off super-couple sparks. Jack continued to try to move in on Jennifer, but refused to admit that was what he was doing. Jennifer's constant urging that he do the right thing ended up having a huge effect on Jack. The newspaper business was also a very good influence on him, and before he knew it, he found himself wanting to do good things for the sake of doing them, and not for the sake of being thought a hero. He tried to subtly get closer to Steve, Adrienne and Jo; Steve was very leery of the purported change. Steve's presumed-dead wife Marina came to town and blackmailed Steve to help her find a key. Intrigued by this, Jack started to try to snoop around, and Steve kept warning him to keep out of it. Eventually, Jack struck up a friendship with Marina's very kind sister Isabella, whom she had been keeping locked up in a sanitarium. Jack helped Isabella escape, and the two struck up a genuine friendship. At this time, Isabella's blind acceptance of him, as well as the other good influences in his life, had pushed Jack into becoming the kind of person who took responsibilities for the things he had done. Jack began to feel that he was a terrible person who didn't deserve a woman like Jennifer. He was terrified he would end up hurting her like he had hurt Kayla, or the way Harper had hurt all the women he had attacked, or even the way Duke had hurt his mother and sister. As Jack began to realize the depth of how bad his past actions were, he frantically sought to push Jennifer away. Jo Johnson and Isabella Toscano both tried to get him to see that he and Jennifer made sense. Jennifer had fallen in love with Jack by now, and she was finally admitting it to herself. Although initially against the match, her grandmother was also starting to see the magic between the two. Jack ended up finding the missing key and helping Steve find Kayla, who had been kidnapped by Victor Kiriakis (who also wanted the key, since he had been searching for it for years) this finally brought Jack together with Steve, and although his relationship with his family was still on shaky legs, Jack was asked to be Steve's best man at his remarriage to Kayla, who was also struggling to accept the reformed Jack. During the Key incident, Jack had tried hard to persuade Kayla not to leave Steve, and Kayla had finally realized that Jack really did want to help bring Steve and Kayla together. Jack discovered that the treasure behind the key was Isabella's mother's diary. The diary revealed that Isabella was Victor Kiriakis's daughter, and that Isabella's father, Ernesto, had killed Isabella's mother. Frantic to protect Isabella from this harsh and terrible truth, he ripped out the truth-revealing pages and gave her the rest of the diary. Jennifer tried to force Jack into declaring himself by getting engaged to Emilio, but Jack held steady. Jennifer tried on numerous occasions to seduce him, but Jack tried very hard to resist her, believing firmly he did not deserve Jennifer. Harper contacted Jack in an effort to get Jack's help in convincing the parole board that he should go free. Jennifer and Jack shared a very passionate set of kisses when Jennifer tearfully begged Jack to start seeing himself as a good man. Jack was convinced that he was just like Harper and that he owed to Harper, as his son, to help him. Jennifer desperately wanted Harper to leave Jack alone, because Jack was doing so well at travelling a redemptive path. Jennifer felt Harper was a toxic weight around Jack's neck. Furious that a \\"little girl\\" presumed to tell him what to do, Harper told a frightened Jack that he would kill Jennifer if she continued this behavior. Although Harper was in jail, Jack knew that his adoptive father would find a way to make it happen, so he pushed Jennifer away by firing her. Jennifer was quickly hired by WATB, a television station, and ended up becoming an anchorwoman. When Jennifer was set to marry Emilio, Jack kidnapped her on her wedding day so that she would have time to think about her future, and he confessed his true feelings. Of course, Jennifer was asleep during his heartfelt speech. They ended up on a ledge together after Jennifer ran off when she realized he was faking a news report of dangerous bears in the area. Jack finally appeared to be giving into Jennifer, and the two were gently kissing on the ledge when Melissa and Emilio came and rescued them. Jennifer was furious at Jack for pushing her away yet again, and she told him that she would marry Emilio. Emilio decided to delay the wedding, and he was developing feelings for his singing partner, Melissa, who returned those feelings. Neither Emilio nor Melissa were ready to admit those feelings to themselves or each other. Jack and Jennifer ended up on a cruise together in the name of work. The cruise was secretly being orchestrated by Isabella's presumed-dead alleged father, Ernesto. Ernesto set the whole thing up so he could kill everyone involved with Isabella. Ernesto wanted Isabella dead for accidentally killing Marina. Ernesto had already poisoned and killed Isabella's mother long ago. During the \\"Cruise of Deception\\" arc, Jack and Jennifer finally made love on a remote island after being shipwrecked. =1991‚Äì98= When they got back home, Jack was still nervous about one day hurting Jennifer. He was getting used to the idea of them as a couple when he ended up killing Harper accidentally when he tried to stop Harper from shooting Steve on Steve's wedding to Kayla (Jack had been best man when Steve tried to marry Kayla after the Marina incident nullified Steve's marriage to Kayla) but the wedding was interrupted when Kayla was wrongly arrested for Marina's murder. The real killer was Isabella who had killed her sister accidentally and then blocked it from her mind. After killing Harper, Jack was hammered by the press about his dark and dangerous past. It brought back all of his fears and self-loathing and despite counsel from Steve and Jennifer's persistent love, he pushed her away yet again, this time making her feel so hopeless that she embarked to New York on an adventure to try to protect her boarding-school best friend Katarina from an arranged marriage to Lawrence Alamain. Jack tried to rush to New York to protect her and although the two declared their love and reunited, she refused to give up her subterfuge. In the meantime, Steve was \\"killed\\" by a bomb meant for Bo Brady, all evidence pointed to Lawrence as being behind Steve's death, because Lawrence had a vendetta against Bo from years ago when Bo helped Katarina (aka Carly Manning) get away from him when he and Katarina fought when she found out his true identity. He had tried to fool her into thinking he was someone else so that she would fall in love and marry him. Bo's interference destroyed his plans and he wanted revenge. Jack rushed back to Salem when he found out Steve had been hurt and he spent hours at the hospital with Kayla and his mother and sister. As he grew closer to his family and began to build a better relationship to Kayla, Steve took a turn for the worse, and died. Jack then realized that you could not push the ones you loved away, as you might not ever get a chance to tell them how you really feel. During this time, Lawrence forced Jennifer to go through the wedding by kidnapping her and her grandmother and making them go to his country. Jack flew to Lawrence's home country and he tried once again to rescue Jennifer, but he was hit on the head prior to the wedding and while he was incarcerated, Jennifer was raped by Lawrence Alamain. Meanwhile, Frankie Brady was also being held prisoner by Lawrence as bait. He was really Katarina's brother Francoise. Traumatized by the rape, Jennifer flinched whenever Jack tried to get close after they got back to Salem. Remembering how and why Kayla always rejected his advances, Jack began to suspect Jennifer and Frankie of having an affair when Jennifer begged Frankie to move in with her after rejecting Jack's offer to live together. Jennifer then turned down Jack's proposal, but when he came back as Santa Claus, she relented, feeling some of the old love for him. Jennifer was reeling from the rape and was having trouble dealing with the fact that Jack himself had committed rape. She was unable to tell Jack, and the misunderstandings began to mount. Every time Jennifer flinched, Jack was reminded of what went on when he was married to Kayla and begged Jennifer to tell him if she wanted out of the relationship. Jennifer refused to acknowledge that anything was wrong, and their relationship was temporarily derailed when Jennifer slapped Jack and called him a rapist when he tried to force her to kiss him to remind her of the passion between them. The kiss triggered a flashback of what happened with Lawrence, but a heartbroken Jack thought that Jennifer had finally come to her senses and begun to see that he really was a dangerous man. Jennifer begged him to forgive her, but he was deeply hurt and ended the engagement. He ended up marrying Eve Donovan so that they could both inherit Nick Corelli's fortune. Jack needed the money to stop Lawrence (who had followed them all to Salem) from buying Diana Colville's half of the Spectator. Jack married Eve (in name only) after seeing Jennifer and Frankie at the midtown motel. Jennifer was there to meet a source, but seeing Frankie holding a tearful Jennifer after Frankie insisted Jennifer tell him what was wrong with her, he got the wrong idea. Jack and Jennifer were thrown together in another adventure when they were forced to share a train cabin during the Train arc where they were trying to find the murder weapon used to kill Nick Corelli. Eve was accused of killing Nick and Jack and Jennifer were trying to prove her innocence. Eve and Frankie were developing into a couple, and Jack continued to pretend he had no feelings for Jennifer left. After a lot of hurt and misunderstandings, Jennifer finally confessed to Jack what had happened. The revelation caused him a great deal of anguish‚Äînot only because the woman he loved had been suffering so much, but because he felt that he was no better than the man who had done it to her. Jennifer finally convinced him to at least try to give their relationship a chance. Jennifer pressed charges against Lawrence and Jack stood by her side, gaining new insight as to how he had made Kayla feel during their own trial for his rape of her. The experience brought Jack and Jennifer even closer together, aided surprisingly by Kayla who urged Jack not to let his own past prevent him from being there for Jennifer. Kayla and Shane worked with Jack and Jennifer to bring Lawrence down, and Jack admitted on the witness stand that what he had done to Kayla had truly been rape. Unlike Jack, Lawrence was convicted of marital rape and served a few years of jail time. Jack proposed to Jennifer as soon as the trial was over and the couple finally got married in 1991. The ceremony took on a Wild West theme and the newlyweds honeymooned in Hollywood, California. They had sex on the set of a game show, conceiving their daughter Abigail. Soon after, Jack felt sure he was having a relapse of Hodgkin's Disease and set on a mission to find Jennifer a suitable new husband. Nevermind the fact that Jack was in perfect health. However, Abby developed a mystery illness that Jack traced back to his own father's shady business practices. Wrought with guilt, Jack left town, leaving Jennifer alone to raise their daughter. Soon, smooth-talking Peter Blake entered the picture and Jennifer's heart. Peter and Jennifer married at Aremid in 1995, despite Jack's return to Salem. Jennifer didn't realize that Peter (Stefano DiMera's adopted son) had conspired to make Jennifer's mom look crazy, when Jennifer found out about Peter's shady past, she served him with divorce papers, but she refused to take Jack back, Jack suspected that Peter planned to kidnap Jennifer and Abby, and he was right, the two men struggled and Peter was presumed killed, after one glorious Christmas with Jennifer and Abby, Jack was sent to prison for Peter's murder, Jack later escaped to find Jennifer, after an alive Peter kidnapped her. When all was said and done Peter was in jail and Jack and Jennifer were back together and living in Africa with Abby. =2000‚Äì07= In Africa, Jennifer didn't exactly find the devoted husband and father she was hoping Jack had become. Jack, who had lost his paper and his fortune, became obsessed with the idea of making his money back and began to get himself involved in get-rich-quick schemes, many of which Jennifer found impractical and shady. To make matters worse, these business ventures would often cause Jack to disappear, sometimes for weeks at a time, without so much as a phonecall to Jennifer. Eventually deciding nothing had changed, Jennifer packed up her stuff and left with Abby one day while Jack was gone, without telling him they were going (which was first to Ireland and eventually back to Salem.) On a tip from Jennifer's grandmother Alice Horton, Jack learned that Jennifer was to be in Paris for coronation of Princess Greta Von Amburg. Jack, who was in Italy in the time, managed to get to Paris before Jen could, and ambushed her at the coronation. There they had it out, Jennifer blasted Jack for his antics in Africa and for his stubborn refusal to grow up and begin shouldering the responsibilities expected of him as a husband, father and man while Jack expressed his outrage and Jennifer's just skulking off with their daughter without so much as a word. Eventually, after tempers calmed and they were able to discuss the problems rationally, they agreed to return to Salem where they would attempt to work out a custody agreement of Abby. Jack, however, had much more in mind. In his latest attempt to win Jennifer back, he suggested the three of them all move in together under one roof, as neither of them had a place to stay, and the stability would be good for Abigail. Jennifer protested the idea, but was goaded into when Jack suggested that if he was able to put Abby before their personal differences, she should as well. While the arrangement was initially confrontational at best, with Jack and Jennifer constantly verbally sparring with each other, eventually after Jack managed to rescue Jennifer after her car went over a bridge and comforted her after she thought the same car accident had killed the infant son of her cousin, Jennifer began to entertain the idea that perhaps Jack was really, finally, changing into the kind of man she thought he was when they were married. Meanwhile, Jack used the attractive Princess Greta Von Amburg, with whom he struck up a friendship for purposes of his scheme to win Jennifer back, to make Jennifer jealous, which Jennifer saw immediately through. However, when Jennifer began to date the sensitive and romantic Brandon Walker, Jack was determined to continue, especially after he interpreted it as working. The plan hit a snag when Greta developed real feelings for Jack. As his heart belonged to only Jennifer, Jack tried to let her down gently, but when Greta (who had recently been dumped twice for other women) realized she was being rebuffed again, she began crying. Wanting to spare her feelings, Jack told her was gay and thus just wasn't attracted to any woman. After a few complicated (and hectic for Jack) months of trying to make Jennifer think Greta and he are involved while trying to make Greta think he's gay, eventually the truth came out to Jennifer. Jennifer was livid at Jack for playing both her and Greta for fools, and plotted to seduce Jack in the shower in an effort to catch him in his own lie. Jennifer's scheme, however, does not go according to plan as Jennifer finds herself unable to resist Jack as well. When Jack, guilty at this all this happening as a result of his deceptions, stops the interlude just short of sex, Jennifer finds herself surprisingly disappointed and very confused as to how she feels. Not long after this, Greta finds out Jack's straight and leaves town, and Jack is now left distraction free in his, now more honest, pursuit of Jennifer. The relationship between Jennifer and Brandon eventually fizzles and Jennifer begins dating Colin Murphy a mysterious Irish man she met in Africa who she had originally gone to Ireland to meet. Briefly, Jack dated Billie Reed which made Jennifer jealous, although she refused to admit it. Jack comforted Jennifer when her cousin Hope was suspected dead which lead to a passionate embrace. But Jennifer pushed him away once again. Hurt and angry by her mixed signals and her feelings for Colin, Jack eventually put distance between them. Jennifer soon realized Colin was a con artist and that she truly loved Jack. She told Jack she wanted to get back together. He was hesitant but agreed to spend Christmas with her and Abby where they finally declared their love for one another. Colin was not happy with Jack and Jennifer getting cozy again. Jennifer overheard him threaten Jack's life. To prevent this from happening, she distracted Colin by sleeping with him. Jennifer was sick with guilt when Colin told a heartbroken Jack. That same evening, Colin was murdered. Both Jack and Jennifer suspected each other (for the obvious reasons) and Jack even turned himself in to deflect suspicion off of Jennifer. Eventually the murderer turned out to be neither of them. Jennifer was dismayed once again when she suspected she was pregnant with Colin's baby. After she told Jack, he told her he would stick by her side no matter what. Thankfully, she was not and on Valentine's Day, Jennifer proposed to Jack. In May 2003, they finally remarried. In October 2003, Jack began working with police officer Abe Carver, leading to both men supposedly being murdered by the Salem Stalker (Marlena Evans). Jennifer was forced to disconnect a brain dead Jack's life support, but she was comforted by the fact that she was now pregnant with Jack's second child. In May 2004, it was revealed that Jack and all of Marlena's victims were alive and being held on a tropical island by Tony Dimera, who had faked all of the murders. Jennifer eventually found her way to the island, and gave birth to a son named Jack Patrick. While escaping Tony's island, Jack was again presumed dead after a tsunami, but was again Tony's prisoner in a castle, including the sexy Cassie Brady who was Jack's cellmate. During this time, despite possible temptations on either side by Patrick Lockhart (a good-looking conman working for Tony who had man who had Jennifer in his sights) and Cassie for Jack, both managed to be one of the only couples (of many) dealing with fake dead spouses who stayed true to each other. In April 2005, Jack lead another escape from the castle and he Jennifer were reunited at the bedside of a minorly injured Abigail (she had been in a car accident) and Jack got to know his infant son, Jack \\"J.J.\\" Deveraux Jr. In June 2005, Jack received news that he was dying and only had about 3 months left to live due to a rare blood disease. Instead of trying to find out more about his illness, Jack worked to set Jennifer up with her old boyfriend, Frankie Brady in order to protect her from the aforementioned Patrick, who he was sure would be after her the moment Jack was gone. Jack was again presumed dead after a car accident, although his body was never found. Jack had decided to stage his death, since he didn't want his loved ones to watch him die. In actuality, Jack was dying in a hospice outside of Salem, and had no intention of returning to Salem. Jennifer had learned of Jack's devotion to her marrying Frankie and wanting to grant his final wish had moved on with Frankie and was (fairly unenthusiastically) preparing to marry him, despite Abigail's strong objections. Jack's plans changed when one of his hospice workers turned out to be his presumed dead brother Steve Johnson. Steve had no memory of who he was and was living under the name Nick Stockton. After confirming they were brothers by a DNA test, Jack agreed to return to Salem if Steve accompanied him. The duo returned to Salem in spring 2006 during Jennifer and Frankie's wedding ceremony, and the brothers were reunited with their widows. Jennifer's opinions were mixed because although she was elated to find out the man she loved was alive, she was as angry at him as she'd ever been for letting her think he was dead when he wasn't. Jack continued to get worse and Jennifer was unable to break away from her commitment to Frankie, despite not truly being in love with him. She felt guilty about hurting Frankie, who was representing the stability and steadiness she had always wanted and which Jack had never really provided for her, and wary about any possibility of a future with Jack who up until now had repeatedly come in and out of her life. Frankie found on the internet a drug trial that could help Jack, and it worked leaving Jack, Jennifer and Frankie caught up in an uncomfortable triangle. Soon after, Jack and Jennifer were kidnapped when Jack was investigating the recent murder of a cop that sparks began to fly. After escaping their captors and getting lost in the woods, Jennifer vented some of her anger out at Jack, and they eventually had sex. Jack collapsed soon afterwards due to cold and hunger and still not up to his full strength after the illness. Jack recovered however, and Jack and Jennifer were reunited for what is currently the final time. Jennifer gently let Frankie know that she cared deeply about him, but Jack had always been the love of her life, and she was going to build her life with him. Finally realizing that Jennifer never would be his, a heart-broken Frankie eventually left Salem. The couple received great news when Jack and Jennifer were both offered dream jobs in London. Wanting a fresh start, Jack and Jennifer left for Europe with J.J. while teenaged Abigail, who supported her parents move but didn't want to leave her school and friends, remained in Salem with family. Jack returned briefly in April 2007, when Abby and he went to New York City for her spring break. Not long after that, Abby decided to spend the summer of 2007 in England with her parents. =2010‚Äì12= Jennifer returned briefly to Salem in June 2010 for Alice Horton's funeral. In November 2010, she moved back to Salem but without Jack. It was explained that Jack had left on a walkabout to Australia to \\"find himself\\", much to Jennifer's chagrin. Despite significant events occurring to their family - most notably Jennifer almost dying due to her heart being removed from her body in a black-market operation - Jack has remained completely silent and out of reach of communication, with only occasional blog posts and terse e-mails existing to suggest Jack is even alive. All phone calls go unanswered and no one in Salem has seen him in almost a year. Abigail returned in February 2011. Jennifer began dating Dr. Daniel Jonas during the summer of 2011. Jack returned to Salem on September 23, 2011. Daniel was preparing to ask Jennifer to move in with him, when an eavesdropping Jack literally fell into the cake beside them, once again reuniting the supercouple. Jack later explains to Jennifer that he was not on a walkabout, but a hostage in Afghanistan while working on a story. After realizing Jack didn't purposely leave her, Jennifer is torn between the two men who adore her: 1) the father of her children with whom she has a long history (but who is unreliable) and 2) the other who she's only known a few months but has so far done no wrong. On March 8, 2012, Jennifer and Jack state that J.J. is currently attending boarding school. Jack dies in August 15, 2012, after being trapped inside of an elevator that fell and crashed. =2015= Jack and Jennifer became grandparents when Abigail gave birth to a son, Thomas Jack Deveraux, who is named after Tom Horton and Jack. =2018‚Äì= Jack and Jennifer became grandparents again when Abigail gave birth to her second child, a daughter named Charlotte. Jack returns on New Year's Eve alive with Eve Donovan. While Jennifer is initially elated to have the love of her life back, Jack unfortunately breaks her heart and the heart's of the rest of his family by stating he has amnesia and can not remember her or anything else about his life. Under the influence of Evem Jack runs for mayor and wins the race, Jack marries Eve and insists that he is in love with her, although he insists he has no interest in remembering Jenifer, he does want to remember his children so he gets Dr. Rolf's serum so he can remember, Eve destroys the serum, which angers Jack so he divorces her after seeing her true colors, Jennifer and Jack go to Chicago together to find Dr. Rolf, they take him back to Salem and he recreates the serum, but when they get back to the lab the serum is destroyed, they naturally assume it was Eve that destroyed the lab, but it was Dr. Shah who destroyed the lab and ultimately kidnapped Jennifer and held her hostage, both Jack and J.J. are very worried about Jennifer, and start looking for her, Jack gets a Cryptic Text from Jennifer telling where she is. But when Jack and J.J. get there it's empty, not long after Jack get a call from Dr. Shah telling him to do exactly what he says, Jack rushes to the apartment where Jennifer is being help captive, Jack and Dr. Shah fight and they both get knocked out, Jeniffer rushes to Jack and asks him if he's okay, Jack looks at Jennifer as he's remembering their life together. He looks at Jennifer and says \\"I remember\\".

Lindenstrauss's name reached headlines when he acquitted the suspects in the notorious gang rape of a fourteen-year-old girl in kibbutz Shimrat, a decision overturned by the Supreme Court. As chair of the Judges Delegation, he became known for his stern opposition to the abolition of the Judges Feedback by the Lawyers Guild of Israel, and helped lead the judges boycott against the Guild incident. Upon the retirement of State Comptroller, Eliezer Goldberg, Lindenstrauss was the sole contender for the position.

Since the beginning of the film form, it has been an essential part of any motion picture. Originally a motionless piece of artwork called title art, it slowly evolved into an artform of its own. In the beginning, main title design consisted of the movie studio's name and/or logo and the presentation of the main characters along with the actor's names, generally using that same artwork presented on title cards. Most independent or major studio had their own title art logo used as the background for their screen credits and they used it almost exclusively on every movie that they produced. Then, early in the 1930s, the more progressive motion picture studios started to change their approach in presenting their screen credits. The major studios took on the challenge of improving the way they introduced their movies. They made the decision to present a more complete list of credits to go with a higher quality of artwork to be used in their screen credits. A main title designer is the designer of the movie title. The manner in which title of a movie is displayed on screen is widely considered an art form. It's often been classified as motion graphics, title design, title sequences and animated credits. The title sequence is often presented through animated visuals and kinetic type while the credits are introduced on screen. From the mid-1930s through the late-1940s the major film studios led the way in Film Title Art by employing artists like Al Hirschfeld, George Petty, Ted Ireland (Vencentini), William Galraith Crawford, Symeon Shimin, Alvan \\"Hap\\" Hadley, and Jacques Kapralik. Quality artists met this challenge by designing their artwork to \\"set a mood\\" and \\"capture the audience\\" before the movie started. An overall 10% jump in box-office receipts was proof that this was a profitable improvement to the introduction of their motion pictures. One famous example of the form is the work of Saul Bass in the 1950s and 1960s. His modish title sequences for the films of Alfred Hitchcock were key in setting the style and mood of the movie even before the action began, and contributed to Hitchcock's \\"house style\\" that was a key element in his approach to marketing. Another well known designer is Maurice Binder, who designed the often erotic titles for many of the James Bond films from the 1960s to the 1980s. After his death, Daniel Kleinman has done several of the titles. However, the leader in the industry in the 1990s - 2000 was Cinema Research Corporation, with over 400 movie titles to its credit in that time period alone, and almost 700 titles in total from the 1950s to 2000. Modern technology has enabled a much more fantastical way of presenting them through use of programs such as Adobe After Effects and Maxon Cinema4D. Although a form of editing, it's considered a different role and art form rather than of a traditional film editor.

He played 14 seasons with the Milwaukee Brewers, and one season with the Toronto Blue Jays. Early years Moore attended Minor High School in his hometown of Birmingham, Alabama, and in June 1971 was selected by the Milwaukee Brewers in the fifth round of the 1971 MLB draft. He played in the Brewers' minor league system from 1971 through 1973, with the short season Class A Newark Co-Pilots (1971), Single-A Danville Warriors (1972), Double-A Shreveport Captains (1973), and Triple-A Evansville Triplets (1973). Major league career =Milwaukee Brewers= Moore made his major league debut with the Brewers on September 8, 1973, during a 15‚Äì1 loss to the New York Yankees. He appeared in a total of eight games late in the 1973 season, batting 5-for-27 (.185) with three RBIs. During the 1974 and 1975 seasons, Moore played 72 games (batting .245) and 73 games (batting .290), respectively. He played defensively at catcher through August 1975, then mostly as a left fielder through May 1976, at which time he returned to catching. During the 1976 season, he appeared in 87 games, batting .191 with three home runs and 16 RBIs. On October 3, 1976, at Milwaukee County Stadium, Moore was the last runner batted in by Hank Aaron, crossing the plate on Aaron's sixth-inning single in the Brewers' 5‚Äì2 loss to the Detroit Tigers. Moore's playing time then increased, as he appeared in 138 games in 1977 (batting .248), 96 games in 1978 (batting .269), and 111 games in both 1979 and 1980 (batting .300 and then .291). Moore hit for the cycle on October 1, 1980, in a Brewers 10‚Äì7 win over the California Angels. He also had two stolen bases in the game, becoming the first (and, through the 2017 season, only) MLB player to have two steals in a game while also hitting for the cycle. During the strike shortened 1981 season, Moore appeared in 48 games, batting a career-high .301. He batted 2-for-9 (.222) in the 1981 ALDS, which the Brewers lost to the Yankees, 3 games to 2. Moore played 133 games in 1982, batting .254 and had 13 outfield assists, in his first year playing predominantly in right field. He hit 6-for-13 (.462) in the 1982 ALCS, and made an important defensive play in the fifth inning of the final game, throwing out Reggie Jackson at third base from right field, as the Brewers defeated the Angels, 3 games to 2. Moore then hit .346 (9-for-26) with three doubles and two RBIs in the 1982 World Series, which the Brewers lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. Moore continue to play in right field during the next two seasons; in 1983 he played in a career-high 151 games, batting .284, and in 1984 he played in just 70 games while batting .234. During his final two seasons with Milwaukee, Moore returned to catching, playing in 105 games and batting .232 in 1985, and playing in 80 games and batting .260 in 1986. In November 1986, Moore became a free agent. The Brewers offered him a one-year contract, but with a significant pay cut (20 or 30 percent) as he only would have played in about 40 games; Moore called the offer \\"disgusting and insulting\\". In his 14 seasons with the Brewers, Moore appeared in 1283 regular season games, batting .262 with 35 home runs and 401 RBIs. =Toronto Blue Jays= Moore did not get signed by a major league team to start the 1987 season, so he played with the Single-A San Jose Bees through May. Later comments from Moore linked his lack of offers to collusion by owners. In early June, he was signed by the Toronto Blue Jays. Moore appeared in 51 games with the Blue Jays, batting .215 with one home run and seven RBIs. In the offseason, the Blue Jays did not re-sign Moore, bringing his career to a close. Post-playing career After his playing career ended, and for more than fifteen years, Moore worked as a sales representative for a fastener company in his hometown of Birmingham. In 2014, Moore was selected to the All- Time Alabama Baseball Team and to the Milwaukee Brewers Wall of Honor.

Facts Two Commonwealth Acts, the Training Guarantee Act 1990 and the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990 mandated a minimum amount an employer had to spend training their workforce. Further, employers had to pay any shortfall in the amount that had to be spent in training and the actual amount to the government. Northern Suburbs General Cemetery Reserve Trust did not spend the minimum amount, and had to pay the difference to the government. They argued the Act was unconstitutional because it was not a valid law with respect to taxation. If the laws achieved their purpose, then no revenue would actually be collected by the Commonwealth. Further, looking at the statements of objectives of the Acts, raising revenue was not an objective. Decision Per Mason CJ, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ: The laws were made pursuant to the taxation power. Although revenue raising was not a stated objective, it intrinsically was an objective of the Acts. More importantly, if a law on its face is one with respect to taxation, the law does not cease to have that character simply because parliament seeks to achieve a purpose not within Commonwealth power. The plaintiffs argued that the money paid was not a tax but a fee for services. The court held that it was not a fee for services because the connection between the service and the fee was too remote. The court could not determine for what service the fee was paid.

It is related to the dedicated deck card or tile game Gnav. Play Any number of players may participate, using a standard deck of 52 cards without jokers. The card rankings (from highest to lowest) are K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-A, or alternately A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2. Suits are irrelevant. The goal in each hand is to avoid ending up with a lower-valued card than any other player.Hoyle's Games, Edmond Hoyle, revised and brought up to date by R. F. Foster, 1926. A. L. Burt Company, New York. Each player starts the game with the same number of chips or counters, usually two to four. When the game is played for money, all players contribute the same amount to a central pot. Each player is dealt one card face-down, after which play begins with the player to the left of the dealer. After examining his/her card, a player may either keep it or exchange it with the player to his/her left. However, if the intended recipient is holding a card of the highest value (depending on which set of rankings is being used), he/she turns it face-up and the trade is nullified. Any player who shows a top-value card in this manner is considered to have completed his/her play for the hand. Play proceeds clockwise around the table, with the dealer playing last; instead of trading cards with someone else, though, the dealer may exchange his/her card for the top one from the deck. After all players have taken a turn, they turn their cards face-up and the one with the lowest-valued card loses one chip. If two or more players tie for lowest card, they each lose one chip, except in variants that include \\"pairing up\\". The dealer rotates one position clockwise around the table for each new hand. Players who lose all their chips are out of the game; the last remaining player wins and collects all the money in the pot. However, if the last two players both lose their final chip in a tie, the game has no winner; the money remains in the pot, and all players make a further bet and start a new game. Variants * Players holding cards of the same value are considered to have \\"paired up,\\" and their combined cards outrank any single card regardless of its value. For example, in a four-player game, two players holding sixes would outrank one opponent with a king and another with a queen; the queen is now the low card and must give up one chip. If two or more groups pair up in a single hand, higher pairs beat lower ones, triples beat pairs, and quartets beat triples. * Players stuck with an ace have to pay double. * On their exchange the dealer may cut the deck and then turn up the top card. * The dealer is not allowed to exchange with the deck if the top card is a king. * If the player who is forced to exchange gives an ace or deuce (2), they announce it aloud, but the player who initiated the exchange says nothing, as their card may be passed on. * Counters are not used and the player with the lowest card at the end of each round is immediately eliminated from the game. * An 8 is considered, in some circles, to be the hardest card in the deck to make a correct pass or no-pass decision about. When a player is dealt a 7, 8, or 9 and it becomes their turn, it is considered good etiquette to announce to the other players that \\"This is the hardest (or one of the hardest) decision(s) a Chase the Ace player can make.\\" * A player who loses all of his/her chips may be allowed to remain in the game, but is eliminated upon losing one more hand. * Sometimes the object is to avoid having the highest card in the deck. The order, from high to low, would be A Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 K. The king is the lowest as it is the best card in the deck, regardless of value. * If the dealer chooses to trade his/her card and receives one of the same rank from the top of the deck, he/she immediately wins the hand and all other players lose one chip. Alternatively, the dealer becomes immune for that hand and the player with the lowest remaining card loses a chip, even if it is higher than the dealer's card. * Kings Jerk - Any player dealt a king may take a chip from the pot, if one is available at the start of the hand. * King Stops All Play - A player dealt a king turns it face-up upon being asked to trade, or when his/her turn comes. All play immediately stops and the loser of the hand is determined based on the cards held at that moment.

These books include Chinese Characteristics, Village Life in China and The Uplift of China. In the 1920s, Chinese Characteristics was still the most widely read book on China among foreign residents there. Biography He was born in Vernon, Connecticut, served as a soldier in the Civil War before graduating from Beloit College in 1867, then briefly attended Andover Theological Seminary before taking a degree in 1871 from Union Theological Seminary. After marrying Emma Jane Dickinson, he was ordained into the Congregational ministry. The couple sailed for China in 1872. After two years of language study in Tianjin, they established themselves at Pangjiazhuang, a village in Shandong, where they stayed until the Boxer Uprising, which did not harm their establishment. Arthur Henderson Smith 1845 ~ 1932 Biographical Dictionary of Chinese Christianity (online) The Boxer Uprising In 1898 and 1899 an indigenous anti-foreign movement arose in Shandong province. One of the missionaries there, possibly Smith, named the participants, mostly farmers, the ‚ÄúBoxers‚Äù because of their athletic rituals. The Boxer movement rapidly spread to several provinces in northern China and, eventually, received the support of the Chinese government. Smith and his wife were attending a missionary conference in Tongzhou in May 1900 when all the missionaries in Northern China found it necessary to seek safety from the Boxers by fleeing to Beijing or Tianjin. The missionary William Scott Ament rescued Smith, 22 other American missionaries and about 100 Chinese Christians in Tongzhou and escorted them to Peking. They took refuge in the Legation Quarter during the siege of the legations from June20 to August14, 1900.Thompson, Larry Clinton. William Scott Ament and the Boxer Rebellion: Heroism, Hubris, and the Ideal Missionary. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2009, 47 Smith‚Äôs role in the siege was a minor one as a gate guard, but he gathered material for his book, China in Convulsion, which is the most detailed account of the Boxer Rebellion.Thompson, 90, 189 In 1906, Smith helped to persuade President Theodore Roosevelt to devote the indemnity payments China was making to the United States to the education of Chinese students. More than $12 million was spent on this Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program.Thompson, 219 Later life and legacy In 1907 Smith was elected the American co-chair of the China Centenary Missionary Conference in Shanghai, a conference attended by more than 1,000 Protestant missionaries. He retired in 1926, 54 years after his arrival in China. His wife died the same year. He died in California in 1932 at the age of 87.Thompson, 216,219 While Gu Hongming who idealized Imperial China, harshly criticised A. H. Smith's writings, the pioneer of China's new literary language Lu Xun wrote that he was influenced by Smith's Chinese Characteristics, which was translated into Chinese, as well as Japanese and several European languages.

The Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution was initiated by Tang Emperor Wuzong reached its height in the year 845 CE. Among its purposes were to appropriate war funds and to cleanse China of foreign influences. As such, the persecution was directed not only towards Buddhism but also towards other religions, such as Zoroastrianism, Nestorian Christianity, and Manicheism. Rationale Emperor Wuzong's economic, social, and religious reasons for persecuting Buddhist organizations and temples throughout China were as follows: * Economic reasons: In 843 the emperor's armies won a decisive battle against the Uyghur tribes at the cost of almost bankrupting the country. Wuzong's solution to the financial crisis was to go after the wealth that had been accumulated in the Buddhist monasteries. Buddhism had flourished greatly during the Tang period, and its monasteries enjoyed tax-exempt status. In 845, Wuzong closed many Buddhist shrines, confiscated their property, and sent the monks and nuns home to lay life. * Social reasons: Confucian intellectuals such as Han Yu railed against Buddhism for undermining the social structure of China. They claimed it eroded the loyalty of son to father, and subject to ruler, by encouraging people to leave their families and to become monks and nuns. Once they had been ordained, they stopped engaging in economic activity such as agriculture and weaving, and live from the support of others. The persecution sought to return monks and nuns to the ranks of tax-paying commoners engaged in what was perceived to be more useful economic activity.Reischauer, p.221 ff. * Religious reasons: While Wuzong saw Buddhism as a foreign religion that was harmful to Chinese society, he became a zealous follower of Taoism, a faith which he regarded as native to China. Buddhism preached the attainment of non-birth or Nirvana, which its critics equated with death, while Taoism promised immortality, a notion that increasingly captured the attention of the emperor as he grew older.Reischauer, p.243 ff. An imperial edict of 845 stated the case against Buddhism as follows:  Events of the Persecution  The first phase of the persecution was one aimed at purifying or reforming the Buddhist establishment rather than exterminating it. Thus, the persecution began in 842 with an imperial edict providing that undesirables such as sorcerers or convicts were to be weeded out from the ranks of the Buddhist monks and nuns and were to be returned to lay life. In addition, monks and nuns were to turn their wealth over to the government; those who wished to keep their wealth would be returned to lay life and forced to pay taxes.Reischauer, p.237 ff. During this first phase, Confucian arguments for the reform of Buddhist institutions and the protection of society from Buddhist influence and practices were predominant.Reischauer, pp. 242‚Äì243. Gradually, however, the Emperor Wuzong became more and more impressed with the claims of some Taoists, and came to develop a severe dislike for Buddhism.Reischauer, p.245. The Japanese monk Ennin, who lived in China during the persecution, even suggested that the emperor had been influenced by his illicit love of a beautiful Taoist princess.Reischauer, p. 246. In addition, as time went by the emperor became more irascible and more erratic in his judgments. One of his edicts banned the use of single-wheeled wheelbarrows, since they break up \\"the middle of the road,\\" an important concept of Taoism.Reischauer, p. 247. As a result, in 844 the persecution moved into a second phase the objective of which was the extermination rather than the reformation of Buddhism.Reischauer, pp. 244, 253. According to the report prepared by the Board of Worship, there were 4,600 monasteries, 40,000 hermitages, 260,500 monks and nuns. The emperor issued edicts that Buddhist temples and shrines be destroyed, that all monks (desirables as well as undesirables) be defrocked, that the property of the monasteries be confiscated, and that Buddhist paraphernalia be destroyed.Reischauer, p.253 ff. An edict providing that foreign monks be defrocked and returned to their homelands resulted in Ennin's expulsion from China.Reischauer, p. 256 ff. By the edict of AD 845 all the monasteries were abolished with very few exceptions. When the monasteries were broken up the images of bronze, silver or gold were to be handed over to the government. In 846, the Emperor Wuzong died, perhaps on account of the elixirs of life he had been consuming. It is also possible that he was intentionally poisoned. Shortly thereafter, his successor proclaimed a general amnesty. The persecution was over.Reischauer, p. 270. Effects on Buddhism The suppression of monasteries and persecution of foreign religions were part of a reformation. The persecution lasted for twenty months‚Äînot long, but long enough to have permanent effects. Buddhism, for all its strength, never completely recovered. For centuries afterwards, it was merely a tolerated religion. The days of its greatest building, sculpture, and painting, and its most vital creative thought, were past. Effects on other religions In addition to Buddhism, Wuzong persecuted other foreign religions as well. He all but destroyed Zoroastrianism and Manicheism in China, and his persecution of the growing Nestorian Christian churches sent Chinese Christianity into a decline, from which it did not recover until the establishment of the Yuan dynasty. It most likely led to the disappearance of Zoroastrianism. Chinese records state Zoroastrianism and Christianity were regarded as heretical forms of Buddhism, and were included within the scope of the edicts. Below is from an edict concerning the two religions: Islam was brought to China during the Tang dynasty by Arab traders but had never had much influence outside of Arab traders. It is thought that this low profile was the reason that the 845 anti- Buddhist edict ignored Islam.

It consisted of four television stations and two AM radio stations. *KIMA-TV Channel 29, (Digital 33) Yakima, Washington *KEPR-TV Channel 19, (Digital 18) Tri-Cities, Washington *KLEW-TV Channel 3, (Digital 32) Lewiston, Idaho *KBAS-TV Channel 43, later 16 (ceased operations 1961), Ephrata, Washington Although Cascade Broadcasting originally produced its own programming schedule selecting shows from all major networks and syndicators under the direction of James \\"Jimmy\\" Nolan, all three remaining television stations are now CBS affiliates. Limited original programming was also produced from the beginning of the regional network. This included news programming, a children's program called \\"Uncle Jimmy's Clubhouse,\\" starring Jimmy Nolan, and a country-western music program titled \\"Buckaroo Time,\\" starring Bert Wells. In 1954, Cascade Broadcasting became the first company in the United States to receive permission from the Federal Communications Commission to operate satellite stations. KEPR-TV, KLEW-TV, and KBAS-TV were given permission to receive KIMA-TV directly off of the air and to retransmit its signal. The only provision the FCC made was that the KIMA-TV station identification announcements were not to be retransmitted by any of its satellites. This saved Cascade the expense of installing AT&T; network television microwave service to its satellite stations. KBAS-TV ceased operations and went dark on November 30, 1961. In 1961, Cascade Broadcasting's original owner, Archie W. Talbot, sold the company to the HalTom Corporation. On October 7, 1968, Cascade was sold to Filmways, Inc. At the time of this sale, Cascade's two AM radio stations, KIMA 1460 kHz, and KEPR 610 kHz, were split off under the ownership of Thomas C. \\"Tom\\" Bostic Jr., Cascade's original owner-manager. Filmways was later purchased by Orion Pictures, which included the Cascade television stations. In 1972, Orion sold Cascade to NWG Broadcasting. In 1986, it was sold to Retlaw Enterprises, Inc., a private Disney concern, and, in 1999, it was sold to Fisher Communications of Seattle, Washington. Fisher was merged into Sinclair Broadcast Group in 2013. Cascade Broadcasting Group (??‚Äì2009) The second Cascade Broadcasting Group was an unrelated business.

In 2008, it entered into an agreement to sell KWBA to Journal Broadcast Group and its Tucson station KGUN-TV; the Federal Communications Commission allowed Journal to buy the station later in the year by issuing a failing station waiver. WBKI was foreclosed on, and the Louisville stations were sold at auction to Fusion Communications; they later bought W24BW outright.

Like other special operations units, SR units may also carry out direct action (DA) and unconventional warfare (UW), including guerrilla operations. As SOWT they were tactical observer/forecasters with ground combat capabilities and fell under the Air Force Special Tactics within the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC). The mission of a Special Operations Weather Team Specialist was to deploy by the most feasible means available into combat and non-permissive environments to collect and interpret meteorological data and provide air and ground forces commanders with timely, accurate intelligence. They collect data, assist mission planning, generate accurate and mission-tailored target and route forecasts in support of global special operations, conduct special weather reconnaissance and train foreign national forces. SOWTs provided vital intelligence and deployed with joint air and ground forces in support of direct action, counter-terrorism, foreign internal defense, humanitarian assistance, special reconnaissance, austere airfield, and combat search and rescue. An article in the 13 May 2019 Air Force Times announced changes to the career field and stated in part: History During World War II, Army Air Forces combat weathermen supported the American effort against the Japanese in the China-Burma-India theater of operations. They also participated in the European theater at Normandy Beach, France; and in the Netherlands and Yugoslavia. However most of the special operations weather lineage, honors, and heraldry origins of WWII are attributed to the 10th Weather Squadron, at New Delhi, India under the 10th Air Force. The 10th Weather Squadron was constituted 10th Weather on 15 Jun 1942 and activated on 24 Jun 1942 (New Delhi, India). Inactivated on 3 Jul 1946 the 10th Weather Squadron was subsequently activated on 1 June 1948, inactivated on 20 May 1952, activated on 16 Jun 1966, organized on 8 Jul 1966, inactivated on 30 Sep 1975, designated 10th Combat Weather Squadron and activated on 1 Apr 1996, and finally inactivated 7 May 2014. The inactivation of the 10th Combat Weather Squadron resulted in special operations weathermen from the unit being integrated into 720th STG. The various regional conflicts escalating in Southeast Asia during the years 1961 through 1975 were causal for reactivating the 10th Weather Squadron on 8 July 1966 at Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base in Thailand, to conduct combat weather operations in Southeast Asia. The 10th subsequently relocated to Long Binh AI, RVN, 3 Aug 1967 and then to Nakhon Phanom, Thailand, 18 February 1974 before being inactivated 30 June 1972. The squadron trained indigenous weather personnel and set up the clandestine weather observation networks throughout Southeast Asia. The 10th Weather Squadron played an important part in the raid on the Son Tay POW camp (a.k.a. Operation Ivory Coast) of 1970. The weather forecasting for this mission primarily relied upon images obtained from Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites, data obtained by weather aircraft reconnaissance sorties, and extensive climatic analysis data. Weather forecaster Major Keith R. Grimes who as Lt Col became the commander of the 10th during the period from 7 July 1974 to 15 Jul 1975 was weather advisor to the Joint Task Force Commander planning Operation Ivory Coast. It is Major Grimes' extensive work with climatological data and forecasts prepared by Air Weather Service personnel credited by Air Weather Service historians as setting raid's general date. Previously during 1963 and 1964 then Captain Keith R. Grimes organized the first ad-hoc Air Weather Service Unconventional Warfare Detachment at Hurlburt Field, FL, during 1963 and 1964. These few in member numbers special warfare weathermen began deploying to Laos with primary mission training friendly forces to take and report weather observation. It was this small in numbers group of weathermen who worked clandestinely in Laos, under dangerous conditions and on a nearly uninterrupted basis, to establish and maintain a weather observing and reporting net essential to combat air operations. Posing as civilians with varying cover stories and carrying only a civilian identification card functioned not only as weathermen and advisors, but as forward air controllers, intelligence gatherers, and fighters. By 1972 the Air Weather Service had twenty-seven jump qualified combat weather team weathermen. Most were assigned in support of the XVIII Airborne Corps, or the 82d and 101st Airborne Divisions, but others were assigned with the 7th Weather Squadron in Germany and eight were assigned with the 5th Weather Wing's Detachment 75 at Eglin AFB's Hurlburt Field in support of Air Force and Army Special Forces. From 1972 to about 1985 parachutist qualified combat weather teams and special operations weather teams were considered nonessential. The prevailing senior leadership attitude during this period was expressed by a question AWS chief of staff, Colonel Edwin E. Carmell hypothetically asked in December 1972 of \\"If you look at it objectively, what kinds of weather [data] do you get out of those guys?\\" in referring to Detachment 75. \\"I think the answer is pretty clear,\\" he continued: \\"they aren't needed.\\" The decisive origins of Special Operations Weather becoming a unique separate career weather Air Force Specialty Code having a specialty description is the 1 October 1996 reactivation of the 10th Air Weather Squadron as the 10th Combat Weather Squadron (10th CWS) and assigned to the 720th Special Tactics Group (720th STG) of the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC). On 5 May 2008, the Air Force approved the establishment of a new Air Force Specialty Code for Special Operations Weather, formally recognizing their commitment to deploy into restricted environments by air, land or sea to conduct weather operations, observe and analyze all environmental data. The 10th Combat Weather Squadron was inactivated 7 May 2014 with special operations weathermen from the unit being integrated into the Special Tactics Group, Wing and Squadrons. Special operations weathermen were not included in the failed US embassy hostage rescue attempt in Iran in 1980, known as Operation Eagle Claw. A review group composed of six senior military officials (Admiral James L. Holloway III, United States Navy, Retired; Lieutenant General Samuel v. Wilson, United States Army, Retired; Lieutenant General Leroy J. Manor, United States Army Retired; Major General James C. Smith, United States Army; Major General John L, Piotrowski, United States Air Force, Major and General Alfred H. Gray, Jr., United States Marine Corps) released a report titled \\"Rescue Mission Report, August 1980\\" on Saturday, 23 August 1980. Issue 15 \\"Weather Reconnaissance\\" (pp. 40 and 41) of the report discusses the ability of the Joint Task Force's weather team (the AWS team was assigned to the JTP J-2 section) to accurately and reliably forecast Iranian weather, particularly along the 200 nautical mile helicopter route is discussed. The report asserts \\"in hindsight\\" that more timely and accurate weather data could and should have been obtained from a WC-130 reconnaissance sortie scouting the route ahead of the helicopters, which would have encountered the dust phenomena before the helicopters and forwarded this info to the helicopters. However immediately following the \\"hindsight\\" suggestion is disclosure of the OPSEC risks of such a WC-130 pathfinder reconnaissance, potentially causing mission compromise, was considered to override any advantages gained. Regardless, this working group's assessment for direct weather causals for mission abort and the Desert One tragedy was insufficient and inadequate command and control combined with lack of precise weather abort criteria being determined during mission planning for mission aircrews to rely on in the absence of positive command and control. Special operations weathermen have directly participated in the majority of modern special operations contingency operations since Operation Urgent Fury, the U.S. invasion of Grenada working with other special operations and conventional forces. These recent successes include operations Just Cause in Panama, Desert Shield/Desert Storm, Task Force Ranger operations in Somalia, Uphold Democracy in Haiti, operations in Bosnia and counter narcotics operations in South America, as well as ongoing operations in support of Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. * 15 May 1942: Parachute School is established at Fort Benning, Georgia. It is a three-week course students attend en route to their duty assignment. * 24 June 1942: Combat weathermen support the American effort against the Japanese in the China-Burma-India theater of operations. * June 1944: Combat weathermen see action during World War II at Normandy Beach, France; and, in the Netherlands and Yugoslavia. * 16 June 1966: The inactivated (20 May 1952) 10th Weather Squadron is reactivated. It is reconstituted and assigned on 8 July 1966 at Udon Airfield, Thailand to conduct combat weather operations in Southeast Asia. The squadron is responsible for training indigenous weather personnel and setting up the clandestine weather observation networks throughout Southeast Asia. * November 1971: Timing for the Son Tay Raid was based on the three-day forecast. However much of the preliminary weather planning deciding when to best make the raid was accomplished in the United States by Major, subsequently Lt Col, Keith R. Grimes on a temporary duty assignment basis from May 1970 until January 1971. During this period he was a faculty member of the Air Command and Staff College. He arrived in Southeast Asia at Tan Son Nhut on 10 November 1970. He subsequently personally selected and obtained two 1st Weather Group weather forecasters (Senior Master Sergeant Van Houdt and Master Sergeant Ralston) to perform the mission forecasting. The weather forecasting for the actual raid mostly relied on weather satellite data and data from numerous aerial weather reconnaissance sorties that were flown daily, including the day of the raid. The weather support personnel successfully used data from weather satellites (DMSP products) and data from aircraft weather reconnaissance sorties to forecast the only 12 hours of \\"go\\" conditions during a 38-day period. Status in the 21st Century The Air Force refers to all its ground element as Battlefield Airmen (BA). This designation includes both the Special Operations career fields of AFSOC ‚Äì Pararescue (PJ), Combat Control (CCT), Special Reconnaissance (SR), and Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) ‚Äì but also other career fields that often train and support AFSOC elements. The latter include the Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD), Survival Evasion Resistance Escape (SERE), and Security Forces (SF) career fields. However, a major overhaul of the SOF career fields is underway. Initial Pipeline SR selection and training has among the highest attrition rate in US SOF hovering around 93%. Following are the initial training courses that the candidates will have to make it through to become a Special Reconnaissance operator shown in a chronological order: *USAF Basic Military Training (BMT), Lackland Air Force Base, Texas (8 weeks). - The first course in the Air Force for all non-prior service enlisted personnel. This is where candidates will learn how to be an Airman, and the basics of the USAF. Special Warfare candidates will meet with cadre every week to perform preprogrammed exercises in an effort to optimize their performance for the pipeline. SW candidates will make their first impressions on the instructors as well as on their future teammates. *Special Warfare Preparatory Course (SW PREP), Lackland Air Force Base, Texas (8 weeks). - SW Prep is designed to give the candidates the best possible chance of getting through the selection.

Candidates will be exposed to sleep deprivation, extended training days, and the importance of performing as a team. *Special Warfare Assessment and Selection (SW A&S;), Lackland Air Force Base, Texas (4 weeks). - Entire length of the A&S;, candidates will be thoroughly evaluated by both the psychologists and cadre in extremely demanding scenarios. A&S; is divided into 2 segments: Field Phase and Selection Phase. Field Phase (2.5 weeks): Candidates can expect to be in a field like setting, sleeping in makeshift lodging in cots with sleeping bags. Training is continuous with zero down days, often experiencing continuous sleep deprivation. Training consists of surface swimming, water confidence, Grass & Gorilla drills, running, rucking, calisthenics, Team events and extended training days (ETD). Selection Phase (1.5 weeks): Following the field phase, candidates will begin clean up of the facilities and will be administered academic and psychological tests, surveys, critiques and interviews. Instructors will compile all relevant information and select only those candidates that meet the desired career field attributes. *Special Warfare Pre-Dive (SW Pre-Dive), Lackland Air Force Base, Texas (4 weeks). -This is a course designed to prepare the candidates for Special Warfare Combat Dive school. Candidates will be subjected to more technical and difficult water confidence training. As of mid 2019, this course eliminated up to 30% of the A&S; graduates. *Special Warfare Combat Dive Course, NDSTC, Panama City, Florida (8 weeks). -Candidates will become combat divers, learning to use scuba and closed circuit diving equipment to covertly infiltrate denied areas. Special Warfare Combat Dive is a SOCOM approved course that incorporates diving fundamental in both Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus (SCUBA) and closed circuit underwater breathing apparatus (UBA). The total program is broken up into two phases of training: open circuit and closed circuit. Students will learn basic diving and advanced rescue diving principles during the open circuit (SCUBA) portion of training. Next, students will learn advanced combat diving fundamental during the close circuit (UBA) portion of training. Upon completion of training, the student will be a certified SOCOM approved combatant diver. *U.S. Army Airborne School, Fort Benning, Georgia (3 weeks). -Airborne school teaches basic parachuting skills required to infiltrate an objective area by static line airdrop.

Upon graduation of the course, students are awarded the Military Freefall Parachutist Badge. *USAF SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape) School, Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington (3 weeks). -Students will spend extended time out in the field learning navigation and survival techniques. These survival techniques include food/water procurement, shelter and bivouac selection/construction, map and compass techniques, and emergency signaling/radio procedures. Additionally, students will learn how to properly respond during a myriad of interrogation techniques and how to resist in the event that they are captured by the enemy. *Underwater Egress, Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington (2 days). - During this training students will learn how to escape a submerged and rotated helicopter utilizing an environment tank which can simulate the experience of being submerged in a real world open ocean scenario. *Special Reconnaissance Apprentice Course, (6 months). - During the Special Reconnaissance Apprentice course, candidates will gain experience in reconnaissance, surveillance, long-range precision engagement and target interdiction, and combat enabling tasks. Other skills will include demolition, communication and signalling, human intelligence gathering, operational preparation of the environment and tactical cyber applications. Upon graduation, candidates will be awarded the SR beret and crest and the 3 level AFSC rating. *Special Tactics Advanced Skills Training, Hurlburt Field, Florida (6‚Äì12 months). -This training typically lasts between 6 months and one year. 3 level SR operators will undergo comprehensive and advanced training on weapons, demolition training, advanced surveillance and reconnaissance ‚Äì to include multi-domain electronic warfare, small unmanned aircraft systems, long-range marksmanship, all-terrain vehicles, maritime operations, and alternate infiltration/exfiltration tactics, techniques, and procedures. Upon graduation, 3 level SR operators are awarded the 5 level AFSC rating and are world-wide deployable. Mission RQ-11B unmanned aerial vehicle in Afghanistan. Special Operations Weathermen were U.S. Air Force meteorologists with unique training to operate in hostile or denied territory. They gathered, assessed, and interpreted weather and environmental intelligence from forward deployed locations, working primarily with Air Force and Army Special Operations Forces. SOWTs could also have been attached to Marine MARSOC and Navy SEAL teams, to collect weather, ocean, river, snow and terrain intelligence, assist mission planning, generate accurate mission- tailored target and route forecasts in support of global special operations and train joint force members and coalition partners to take and communicate limited weather observations. They operated on 2-3-man Environmental Reconnaissance Teams (ERT). ERT's which were attached to 8-9-man Special Tactics Teams (STT) alongside Combat Control (CCT) and Pararescue (PJ) personnel. Together they provide SOCOM a unique capability to establish and control austere airfields in permissive and non-permissive environments. Additionally, Special Operations Weathermen conducted special reconnaissance, fly small unmanned aerial systems (SUAS), collected upper air data, organized, established and maintained weather data reporting networks, determined host nation meteorological capabilities and trained foreign national forces. The mission of their successor, Special Reconnaissance, other than multi-domain reconnaissance and surveillance is not yet publicly available.

The ranges of this system have an average elevations of about and form a natural barrier between the Mediterranean and the Sahara. Its highest summit is the high Lalla Khedidja in the Jurjura Range.Mamdouh Shahin, Water resources and hydrometeorology of the Arab region, 2007 Several large cities such as the Algerian capital, Algiers, with ~1,500,000 residents (2005) and Oran with ~770,000 residents (2005) lie at the base of the Tell Atlas. The Algerian city Constantine with approximately 505,000 residents (2005) lies 80 km inland and directly in the mountains at 650 meters in elevation. A number of smaller towns and villages are situated within the Tell; for example, Chiffa is nestled within the Chiffa gorge. Geography The Tell Atlas runs parallel to the Mediterranean coast. Together with the Saharan Atlas to the south, it forms the northernmost of two more or less parallel ranges which approach one another towards the east, remaining quite distinct from one another in Western Algeria and merging in Eastern Algeria. At the western end, it ends at the Rif and Middle Atlas ranges in Morocco. The Tell Atlas is also a distinct physiographic section of the larger Atlas Mountains province, which in turn is part of the larger African Alpine System physiographic division. The Tell Atlas and the Saharan Atlas form two natural barriers, the first against the Mediterranean and the second against the Sahara. Between them lies the valley of the Chelif and various lesser rivers. South of the Tell Atlas is the high plateau of the Hautes Plaines (~1000 m in elevation) with level terrain where water collects during the wet season, forming large shallow salt lakes which become salt flats as they dry. Agriculture includes grazing of sheep and goats on the grass in better-watered high plateau areas and some farming; dry-land barley is grown there.Les Hautes Plaines alg√©ro-marocaines et le Maroc central The Chelif is a 725 km long river with headwaters in the Tell Atlas to its discharge into the Mediterranean. The Chelif is characterized by an extremely fertile valley. Other noteworthy rivers having their sources in this range are the Medjerda and the Seybouse River. Only seasonal streams are found flowing south from the Tell Atlas. Climate and vegetation The Tell Atlas enjoys a typical Mediterranean climate, warm with dry summers and mild, rainy winters with snow at upper elevations. As a consequence, the northern slopes of the Tell Atlas are forested with the endemic Abies numidica, and Atlas cedar, pine, and cork oak. In the summer a hot, dry wind, the Sirocco, blows north from the Sahara across the Tell Atlas, causing dusty, dry conditions along the northern coast of Africa. Despite the arid climate, some agriculture for barley and wheat farming is found in the Tell Atlas region.William Adams Hance (1975) The Geography of Modern Africa, 2d Ed., Columbia University Press, 657 pages The Chiffa gorge is situated within the Tell Atlas; this location is one of the few remaining habitats for the endangered primate, the Barbary macaque, Macaca sylvanus.C.

Sacramento was named after the Sacramento River, which forms its western border. The river was named by Spanish cavalry officer Gabriel Moraga for the Santisimo Sacramento (Most Holy Sacrament), referring to the Catholic Eucharist. Before the arrival of Europeans, the Nisenan branch of the Native American Maidu inhabited the Sacramento Valley area. The Spanish were the first Europeans to explore the area, and Sacramento fell into the Alta California province of New Spain when the conquistadors claimed Central America and the American Southwest for the Spanish Empire. The area was deemed unfit for colonization by a number of explorers and as a result remained relatively untouched by the Europeans who claimed the region, excepting early 19th Century coastal settlements north of San Francisco Bay which constituted the southernmost Russian colony in North America and were spread over an area stretching from Point Arena to Tomales Bay.Historical Atlas of California When John Sutter arrived in the provincial colonial capital of Monterey in 1839, governor Juan Bautista Alvarado provided Sutter with the land he asked for, and Sutter established New Helvetia, which he controlled absolutely with a private army and relative autonomy from the newly independent Mexican government. The California Gold Rush started when gold was discovered at Sutter's Mill, one of Sutter, Sr.'s assets in the city of Coloma in 1848; the arrival of prospectors in droves ruined Sutter's New Helvetia and trade began to develop around a wharf he had established where the American and Sacramento Rivers joined. In the region where Sutter had planned to establish the city of Sutterville, Sacramento City was founded; Sutter, Sr. put his son in charge in frustration, and Sutter, Jr. worked to organize the city in its growth. However, its location caused the city to periodically fill with water. Fires would also sweep through the city. To resolve the problems, the city worked to raise the sidewalks and buildings and began to replace wooden structures with more resilient materials, like brick and stone. The city was selected as the state capital in 1854 after Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo failed to convince the state government to remain in the city of his namesake. Prior to Sutter's arrival ‚Äì through 1838 Indigenous people such as the Miwok and Maidu Indians were the original inhabitants of the north Californian Central Valley.Severson, p. 17 Of the Maidu, the Nisenan Maidu group were the principal inhabitants of pre-Columbian Sacramento; the peoples of this tribe were hunter-gatherers, relying on foraged nuts and berries and fish from local rivers instead of food generated by agricultural means. The first European in the state of California was conquistador Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, a Portuguese explorer sailing on behalf of the Spanish Empire, in 1542;Severson, p. 19 later explorers included Sir Francis Drake and Sebasti√°n Vizca√≠no. However, no explorer had yet discovered the Sacramento Valley region nor the Golden Gate strait, which would remain undiscovered until, respectively, 1808 and 1623. A number of conquistadors had completed cursory examinations of the region by the mid-18th century, including Juan Bautista de Anza and Pedro Fages, but none viewed the region as a potentially valuable region to colonize. Neither did Gabriel Moraga, who was the first European to enter the Sierra in 1808 and was responsible for naming the Sacramento River, although he incorrectly placed the rivers in the region. However, Padres Abella and Fortuni arrived in the region in 1811 and returned positive feedback to the Roman Catholic Church, although the church disregarded their finds as they were in conflict with all previous views of the area. The Mexicans, who had declared independence in 1821, shared Spanish sentiments,Severson, p. 21 and the area remained uncolonized until the arrival of John Sutter in 1839.Severson, p. 31-32 The area that would become the city of Sacramento was initially observed by many European and American mapmakers as home to Great Plains-based rivers that stretched across the Rocky Mountains and emptied into the Pacific Ocean. Speculation at the time placed the fabled St. Bonaventura River where the American-Sacramento River complex was; mountain man Jedediah Smith mistook the American and Sacramento Rivers for the St. Bonaventura in his 1827 venture into the region, and named the Sacramento Valley the \\"Valley of the Bonadventure\\" before trekking southwards along the Stanislaus River.

John Augustus Sutter arrived in the city of Yerba Buena, which would become the city of San Francisco, after encountering a massive storm en route from the city of Sitka, Russian Alaska; he was later redirected by Mexican officials to the colonial capital of Monterey, where he appealed to governor Juan Bautista Alvarado of Alta California his ambitions to establish an \\"empire of civilization\\" on \\"new land\\". Alvarado noted that he needed to establish a presence in the Sacramento Valley, and realized that Sutter's ambitions allowed him an opportunity to secure the valley without committing extra troops to the region. As a result, he granted Sutter's requestSeverson, p. 30 on the condition that Sutter would become a Mexican citizen.Severson, p. 33 Sutter commenced to build a fort of his namesake, Sutter's Fort, in 1840; the fort became his base of operations.Severson, p. 32 New Helvetia was roughly in size until he negotiated an 1841 deal with the Russians to purchase Ft. Ross, which lay in present-day Sonoma County, and consolidated all of Ft. Ross' holdings with those at Fort Sutter.Severson, p. 34 Sutter's New Helvetia existed within Mexican borders, sporting a large degree of autonomy; John Sutter ruled over New Helvetia with absolute power, and named himself general over a privately developed army composed of Native Americans. John Sutter employed both white people and Native Americans for many mundane and military tasks regarding New Helvetia. After New Helvetia grew to encompass Fort Ross, Sutter's military presence in the region began to garner suspicion from the government of Mexican Alta California; Sutter, who often bragged of his military strength, aggravated the Mexican government with his claims of power. As New Helvetia continued to develop economically, Sutter constructed a ranch at the Nisenan village of Hok and named it \\"Hock Farm\\", designating it his official retreat. New Helvetia was considered a stable colony by 1844, and was the only foreigner-friendly locale in Alta California at the time.Severson, p. 36 Among other foreigners, the Donner Party had designated Sutter's Fort their destination during an overland journey that placed them across the Sierra mountains in the wintertime. A map of northern California gold fields, in relation to Sacramento and Coloma Sutter's empire began to disintegrate when he decided to back the unpopular Alta Californian governor Manuel Micheltorena, who was soon overthrown by Alvarado and Jos√© Castro in an 1841 coup d'√©tat. Sutter was jailed as a result, but not before Micheltorena issued the Sobrante Grant, which added of land to New Helvetian territory.Severson, p. 37 In 1845, Castro arrived at Sutter's Fort and offered a deal to purchase New Helvetia; Sutter declined, although he later expressed regret for not accepting Castro's terms.Severson, p. 42 In 1846, the Bear Flag Revolt was initiated by Americans in Sonoma who were frightened by growing Mexican hostility towards foreign presences in the region; taking the city by surprise, general Mariano Vallejo was captured at his headquarters in the city, and the irregular force demanded use of Sutter's prison facilities to host captured Mexican officials. Agreeing reluctantly, Sutter raised the Bear Flag over his fortification. However, he treated the Vallejos, whom he considered friends, as guests and not as prisoners.Severson, p. 43 While the \\"Bear Flaggers\\" under William B. Ide and John C. Fr√©mont continued to wage war against the Mexican government, Sutter attempted to resume a state of normalcy in New Helvetia, although the lack of manpower as a result of the revolt left productivity lagging.Severson, p. 44 The United States initiated the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in 1846 against Mexico in the wake of the U.S. annexation of the Republic of Texas, whose independence Mexico had not recognized. California, along with Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, most of Arizona and Colorado, and parts of Oklahoma, Kansas, and Wyoming, were annexed by the United States in the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Thus, Sutter's New Helvetia fell under U.S. control. Continuing business as normal, John Sutter dispatched associate James W. Marshall, who was to construct a sawmill in the foothills of the Sierra at the city of Coloma, in 1847.Severson, p. 45 In January 1848, Marshall detected a flake of gold on the ground at the site of Sutter's new mill, and after conducting tests, determined the mineral's authenticity. Word leaked about the discovery nearly immediately.Severson, p. 48 When news reached San Francisco, a rush of hopeful prospectors began to move northwards to the Sacramento Valley, and by the middle of the year, so-called \\"Argonauts\\" flooded Sutter's holdings in search of gold. The arrival of Argonauts in the region decimated the economical integrity of Sutter's New Helvetia,Severson, p. 47‚Äì51 as the prospectors slaughtered his herds of livestock, drove out local Native Americans loyal to Sutter, and divided New Helvetia amongst each other without Sutter's consent. Disappointed with what had become of his holdings, Sutter placed his son as head of fort business operations and retired to Hock Farm. Foundation ‚Äì 1848 to 1850 Birds-eye view of Sacramento, ca. 1857 The real city of Sacramento was developed around a wharf, called the Embarcadero, on the confluence of the American River and Sacramento River that Sutter had developed prior to his retirement in 1849 as a result of gold discoveries at Sutter's Mill in Coloma.Severson, p. 51 John Sutter, Sr. had replaced himself with his son, John Sutter, Jr., who noticed growth of trade at the Embarcadero and considered it a viable economic opportunity; the port was used increasingly as a point of debarkation for prospecting Argonauts heading eastwards. Sutter, Jr. had military officials William H. Warner and his assistant, William Tecumseh Sherman, survey his father's holdings for a location where he could establish a new city and create the city over a grid of numbered and lettered streets for organizational purposes. A number of businessmen, including millionaire-to-be Samuel Brannan, future California governor Peter Burnett, and George McDougall, brother of future California governor John McDougall, were attracted to the waterfront location. However, Sutter, Jr. and George McDougall disagreed over the terms of the lease of the location, and a trade war erupted between Sutter's Sacramento City and McDougall's new base of operations at Sutterville. Sutter, Sr., who had opposed many of his son's decisions, resumed control of his business affairs after Sutter, Jr. ended the competition between the two cities; trade in the area was biased toward Sacramento City as a result of Sutter, Jr.'s efforts.Severson, p. 52 Unlike other settlements of its time and type, Sacramento City did not have gambling houses and saloons until the summer of 1849; the city was free of those businesses for the first few months of its existence.Severson, p. 55 Churches also appeared early on when the Methodist Episcopalian pastor W. Grove Deal established the first church with regular services in May 1849.Severson, p. 56 Catholic reverend Augustine Anderson arrived in 1850 and constructed a church in 1854, while Jews founded a synagogue called Congregation B'Nai Israel in 1852.Severson, p. 61 In 1849, Edward C. Kemble moved north from San Francisco and established the city's first newspaper, The Placer Times. Kemble's newspaper disassembled three months later when Kemble was stricken with sickness.Severson, p. 62 The first Sacramento theatrical stage, located in the Eagle Theatre (Sacramento, California), was founded in October 1849.Severson, p. 68 Sacramento City did not have a formal government during early and mid-1849, and gambling institutions in the region sought to keep only the loose alcalde government. However, many city residents were swayed in favor of the gambling houses; by the fall of that year, the entire legal structure of Sacramento City was established by a large 296-vote margin on a second proposal. The government of California had only just reorganized itself into county units; days after the overhaul, the California State Legislature verified that Sacramento was officially recognized by means of charter in February 1850. Sacramento City later petitioned the Legislature to drop the \\"City\\" from the settlement's name, which was also granted.Severson, p. 66 Sacramento City was serviced by organized public transportation via the rivers and upheld regular street maintenance by 1850; the settlement had reached a \\"home-and-garden\\" stage in development by the same time.Severson, p. 63 Early development ‚Äì 1850 to 1860 In January 1850, a major flood devastated the city. Rain from heavy storms had saturated the grounds upon which Sacramento was built, and the American and Sacramento rivers crested simultaneously. The economic impact was significant because merchandise stationed at the Embarcadero was not secured and washed away in the flood.Severson, p. 72 Sacramento rallied behind Hardin Bigelow, who led efforts to implement emergency measures to protect the city from another disaster of that nature. Responsibility for construction of protective levees and dams won him support, and he was elected first mayor of the city. A second major flood in March 1850 was averted by Bigelow's efforts.Severson, p. 73 In April of the same year, the city experienced its first major fire. A second fire in November destroyed a number of commercial establishments in the city. In response to growing fear of a potential catastrophe, citizen volunteers founded California's first fire protection organization, named the \\"Mutual Hook and Ladder Company.\\" The city adapted by implementing iron window shutters to reduce wind draft and make fires harder to spread. October 1850 brought the arrival of the New World, a riverboat that carried news of California's admittance to the Union.Severson, p. 79 It also brought the cholera epidemic that killed between 800 and 1,000 people within three weeks including between a quarter to half of the city's physicians. Nearly eighty percent of the population fled.Flynn, p. 67 Bodies were buried in mass graves at cemeteries across the city. California State Capitol; one of few state capitols to fly POW flag Those who sought land from 1848 onwards refused to honor the New Helvetian settlement and that Sutter alone held title to so much land; additionally, they refused to recognize the titles of speculators who sold the land at exorbitant prices. The squatters who wished to take from Sutter's land worked to find loopholes in the law that would allow them to claim the land as public and render his, and those of the speculators that bought land from him, invalid.Severson, p. 76 The push for recognition of squatter's rights in the Sacramento area led to the formation of a Law and Order Association amongst the squatters. When a squatter was judged for execution and was denied passage to a squatters' appeals court, the squatters swore that they were prepared for warfare in the case that their claims were denied judgment by higher courts.Severson, p. 77 Rallying under future Kansas governor Charles L. Robinson, the squatters formed militias and prepared to attack the city; however, Hardin Bigelow averted the crisis temporarily by assuring the squatters that arrests will not be made as a result of siding with Robinson. However, violence finally broke out when Bigelow moved to stop Robinson from freeing prisoners held captive aboard the prison brig, the La Grange, on August 14, 1850. Bigelow repelled the force at the cost of his health. The Sheriff, McKinney, moved to attack a retreat near the settlement of Brighton just outside city limits; McKinney and three squatters died, but the event, which came to be known as the Squatters Riot, drew to a close.Severson, p. 79 Additionally, the year afterwards, a group of 213 Sacramentans founded the extralegal Vigilance Committee after the group of the same name and purpose in the San Francisco Bay Area; lynching a prisoner who was pardoned by the mayor of the city, the committee dissolved soon afterwards, losing support after demanding that the mayor step down for interfering needlessly and when the mayor refused to do so.Severson, p. 119 By 1852, Sutter's New Helvetia had collapsed completely, and Sutter's Fort had been abandoned.Severson, p. 96 Sacramento's commerce had become reliant on coins, and the city had outgrown its unstable Gold Rush boomtown status and established itself as a fully fledged community;Severson, p. 94 The Embarcadero, which had driven the growth of Sacramento from the start, no longer solely determined if the city would survive or be abandoned.Severson, p. 105 The year 1852 saw a diversification in the Sacramentan economy; pharmacies, attorney firms, brass foundries, and lingerie shops, among others, lined the streets of the city during this era.Severson, p. 100-101 Additionally, companies were beginning to take advantage of the fish populations in the American and Sacramento Rivers, a resource that Sutter had discovered and utilized during the era of New Helvetia. The Central Valley's capacity for agriculture was also noted, and wheat surpluses that had originated in the Sacramento area were often shipped en route to foreign countries.Severson, p. 102 However, the city caught afire the night of November 2, 1852; nearly 85% of the city was destroyed in the fire. Sacramentans rebuilt the city with brick, rather than the fire-hazardous wood that was the medium for buildings in that era. A second fire in 1854 destroyed twelve newly reconstructed downtown city blocks, including the city courthouse.Severson, p. 107 The American state of California's government met in Monterey in late 1849, the capital of the former Alta California, to conduct the first State Constitutional Convention; the seat of government was set in San Jose, although the government disliked the locale. Former Mexican general Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo promised a viable capital city at Vallejo in 1852. Vallejo was unable to sufficiently construct the city of Vallejo, and the government was moved to the city of Sacramento temporarily; after Vallejo failed again, he released himself from his contract to the state, and the government moved to Benicia until Sacramento made a bid for the capital that the Legislature accepted completely in 1854. The same year, the state legislature voted to make Sacramento the permanent state capital. Construction on the California State Capitol commenced in 1860; the structure would take fourteen years to complete. In early 1855, Colonel Charles L. Wilson and Theodore Judah started work on the Sacramento Valley Railroad; the railroad was the first to be chartered west of the Mississippi River and was done so by Colonel Wilson three years prior. A money panic caused by an unfavorable winter forced Wilson to retire from the project, and he was replaced by Joseph Libbey Folsom; Folsom died in July and was replaced by C. K. Garrison. As ongoing difficulties for the project continued to hinder operations, the length of the railroad was limited to the city of Granite City (later renamed for Folsom), twenty-two miles away.Severson, p. 171 After Judah completed the track for the Sacramento Valley Railroad in 1856, he petitioned the U.S. government for a transcontinental railroad. However, tensions over slavery between pro-slavery and anti-slavery forces in the east took precedence over Judah's proposition. The Civil War era to the twentieth century ‚Äì 1861 to 1900 Theodore Judah plaque in Old Sacramento The California Republican Party was founded in Sacramento on April 18, 1856, when the first mass meeting aggregated in the city. When the American Civil War started, the city was strongly pro-Union, although the opposing side, the Confederate States of America, had active supporters within the city. The city of Sacramento's population was alarmed at the possibility of an invasion by forces that were stationed in Confederate Texas when the Union presence stationed within the city was drawn eastwards for battle.Severson, p. 134 As a result, volunteers organized into military defense forces in case an invasion ever would take place.Severson, p. 134-135 As a means of communication meant to replace the inefficient letter delivery via ocean around South America's Cape Horn, the Pony Express was brought to Sacramento in 1860. This was the first cross- continent means of communication and tied California to the states in the east across the Great Plains. However, the Pony Express only lasted eighteen months and was rendered obsolete upon the arrival of the First Transcontinental Telegraph.Severson, p. 182-183 By 1861, Sacramento was linked to the telegraph lines on the other side of the continent. December 1861 and January 1862 brought about devastating floods that placed the future of the city in doubt.Severson, p. 108 In order to resolve the situation, the city residents agreed that additional levee construction was necessary. However, the city was divided between camps that supported a relatively small grading of a few feet to raise the city just above the rivers' cresting levels and those that supported a substantial grading to accommodate basements in city businesses. In the upcoming election of 1863, the level at which the city should be raised became a primary factor; a candidate that supported high-level grading won, and high-level grading renovation proceeded.Severson, p. 109 Earth was removed from a dangerous bend nearby the confluence of the two rivers and used to raise city blocks in 1868; the city's sidewalks, until construction was finally finished, were uneven because neighbors of raised city blocks often remained at the pre-construction level.Severson, p. 110 After the filled regions beneath buildings had settled, new streets had to be paved. While planking had been used in the past, newly raised streets chose either the smooth (though indurable) Nicolson pavement or the easily dirtied (though durable) cobblestone pavement. Grading and paving processes were fully completed by 1873,Severson, p. 111 leaving the first floors of many buildings at the time as basements and leaving second floors as new main floors. Today, this system of 19th-century basements is known as the Sacramento Underground. While the grading of the city commenced, Theodore Judah, who continued to request government grants in an attempt to build a transcontinental railroad, did not receive the reception he wished; instead, he worked with Daniel Strong and generated the Central Pacific Railroad plan. However, the Sacramento Valley Railroad ejected him from its administration, suspicious of his actions. For matters of funding, Judah met with thirty Sacramento businessmen and discussed the possibility of this railroad.Severson, p. 172 Among those businessmen were the Big Four: Mark Hopkins, Jr., Charles Crocker, Collis P. Huntington, and Leland Stanford. Together, the four formed the Central Pacific Railroad of California in 1861. The American Civil War began, and president Abraham Lincoln approved the railroad without the Southern forces that would've normally opposed the operation;Severson, p. 172-173 ground was broken in downtown Sacramento on January 8, 1863.Severson, p. 174 By 1865, the burgeoning company absorbed the Sacramento Valley Railroad, and the original Western Pacific Railroad was purchased in 1867, which was incorporated to connect Sacramento to Stockton.Severson, p. 180 The California Pacific Railroad Company in 1868 initiated a \\"war\\" with the Central Pacific Railroad over control of Sacramento, involving legal and extralegal action. As a result of the endeavors taken between the two railroad companies, the Yolo-Sacramento Bridge was created, the first bridge across the Sacramento river. The \\"war\\" ended when the California Pacific Railroad was absorbed into the Central Pacific Railroad Company.Severson, p. 182 The dominance of railroad companies prevailed in Sacramento during this part of its history; mayor William Land, who served in 1898‚Äì99, was considered a pawn of the railroad companies, and Southern Pacific Railroad Company executive William Herrin often dodged attempts at reform and bent public policy to better serve his railroad. The First Transcontinental Railroad, whose western component was anchored in Sacramento With the advent of the railroad and the introduction of refrigeration, wheat prices dropped, and fruit became a significant cash crop. As a result, in 1883 onwards until the start of the 20th century, grain ranches that had previously profited from wheat began to bankrupt and close; the original owners of the ranches soon died off, and the heirs deeded land to those who were seeking it; this era brought about a land boom, and the new fruit ranchers in the region made arable hundreds of thousands of acres through irrigation. However, the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 noticeably dampered the economic growth of Sacramento's agriculture. Despite the anti-Asian sentiment, all types of foreigners were drawn to the city starting in the 1890s, ranging from Europeans that had immigrated from Italy, Portugal, and Croatia to Japanese, Korean, Punjabi, and Filipino arrivals.Avella, p. 77-78 Many of these immigrants aligned themselves with the local Democratic Party.Avella, p. 78 Although schoolhouses had existed in Sacramento County since 1853, Sacramento High School, the city's first secondary education institution, was founded in 1856 and instructed students in courses ranging from core English and mathematics to astronomy and bookkeeping. The high school was moved to a permanent location in 1887 as Sacramento's population started to skyrocket, and the high school administration opened twelve elementary feeder schools across the city of Sacramento. Starting in 1894, in tandem with the early civil rights movement, individual schools in the city began to integrate. World War I and the Prohibition ‚Äì 1901 to 1930 The automobile was introduced to the city in 1900 through a local street fair; in 1903, the first car dealership opened, and the year after, twenty-seven Sacramentans owned cars. The number of automobile owners increased exponentially from that point. The advent of the automobile obsoleted careers involving horseback and overland wagon travel and decreased the importance of the steamboat and railroad industries.Avella, p. 89 A series of Progressive Sacramentan politicians rose to key positions in the city government, implementing various methods of reform. Mayor George H. Clark, Land's successor, worked to end illicit gambling activity in the city's poolhouses; he also passed a referendum that reformed the Sacramentan charter government, equalizing the political power of each of the city's wards so as to avoid dominance in wards that hosted a rapidly growing working class population. 1907 saw a breakage in the monopoly that the Southern Pacific Railroad held over Sacramento when the second Western Pacific Railroad requested permission to construct yards in the city's vicinity,Avella, p. 79-80 while women's rights activist L.G. Waterhouse, who headed the Sacramento Women's Suffrage Association, worked toward women's suffrage. Sacramentan women were granted the right to vote in 1911, nearly nine years prior to the passage of the nineteenth amendment that enforced this suffrage nationwide. Mather Air Force Base, located in southern Sacramento, was a significant economic driving force for the city. At the same time, the Rancho Del Paso and Rancho San Juan Mexican land grants that encompassed much of the northern parts of the county were sold to the public; people who invested in county development would construct the settlement of Citrus Heights on the land designated as the grant; plans for communities like Orangevale, Carmichael, and Fair Oaks were set into motion to complement the city's reputation as a fruit production powerhouse.Avella, p. 81 The city began to expand exponentially after the Sacramento government convinced the residents of East Sacramento and Oak Park to approve annexation. The three cities were officially joined in September 1911.Avella, p. 80 The first automobile- friendly settlement to be founded was North Sacramento, which was bisected by Del Paso Boulevard. Nearly 4,000 troops destined for battle in Europe's First World War had come from Sacramento and other cities within the county; of those 4,000, about 100 died. The coming of the war also sparked hysteria amongst the population, biasing them against Germans and concepts associated with Germany. Sacramento's Lutheran churches began to preach in languages other than German. Additionally, a Council of Defense searched for and punished signs of disloyalty to the American cause.Avella, p. 82 City tensions increased with the bombing of the governor's mansion in 1917, and suspects affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World militant party were detained and jailed, although never convicted.Avella, p. 84 When the war ended in 1918, the city celebrated the return of the 363rd Infantry regiment of the 91st Division and the visit of president Woodrow Wilson, who arrived to advocate his League of Nations proposal in 1919 in the face of staunch opposition headed by Governor Johnson and Sacramento Bee editor Charles Kenny McClatchy.Avella, p. 84 The coming of the 1917 American intervention in World War I exponentially increased demand for Curtiss JN-4 biplanes. A contract with the government led to the opening of Mather Air Force Base in the county, and Sacramento grew to rely on the biplanes for continued economic growth up until the end of the war. Surplus military equipment, including the biplanes, were put to use by the Sacramentan populace. In 1929, farmers in the Sacramento area experimented with crop seeding via aerial means; notably, Chinese revolutionary Sun Yatsen, with assistance from Delta farmer Jack Chew, purchased ten surplus aircraft and held sessions for maneuver practice from a local alfalfa field with local Chinese pilots.Holden, p. 333 A growing civilian fascination with aviation in the era was fed by the numerous air shows that were held around the Sacramento area. The California Governor's Mansion as seen in 1981. It was bombed in 1917. In 1920, Sacramento adopted a new charter government that dictated the creation of nine positions on a new Sacramento City Council along with a paid city manager position, which would be held by Illinois journalist Clyde Seavey after the initial rechartering of the government in 1911 that formed five elected nonpartisan commissioner positions failed to effectively serve the city. These actions restricted the power of the mayor and broke the working class' grip over city politics. Seavey pushed strongly for reform, rendering businesses related to clairvoyance nonviable and closing or refusing to license local saloons and poolrooms; Seavey consolidated civic departments to lower the city's budget and reinstated the chain gang punishment to deter crime. In 1903 the Sacramento Solons a minor league baseball team began to play. The Solons played intermittently in Sacramento between 1903 and 1976, with a continuous stretch between 1918 and 1960. After the end of the Sacramento Solons franchise in 1976, Sacramento went without a minor league baseball team until 2000 when the Sacramento River Cats began playing at Raley Field in West Sacramento. The eighteenth Constitutional amendment initiated the Prohibition Era in the United States at the end of World War I. As Northern Californian vineyards were major producers of American wines, the significant loss in business forced many, including Sacramento's two largest vineyards, to close; the city was not sympathetic to either prohibition or the temperance movement, although elements of the temperance movement were noticeable in the Sacramento area. In addition, the river front city border with Yolo County, known as the West End, devolved into a slum that was filled, notably, with speakeasies, bordellos, and buildings used for gambling. The slum was regarded one of the worst west of those in Chicago. As an exchange for locating Mather AFB near Sacramento, a member of the United States Department of War demanded that the city deal with the West End's problems.Avella, p. 85 Old Sacramento State Historic Park, previously a slum known as the West End. The events that followed World War I decreased the popularity for the reformist Progressive movement in the city; hundreds of Sacramentans joined the conservative local chapter Ku Klux Klan. Sacramento's Klansman eyed Catholics, those of more liberal mindsets, and new immigrants with suspicion. However, they worked to portray themselves as anti-racist; notably, the Sacramento Ku Klux Klan helped to paint a local African American church during this time period.Avella, p. 86 Reformers like Seavey worked to dismantle the Ku Klux Klan chapter in Sacramento, although when branded as a \\"red\\", Seavey resigned from his position as city manager.Avella, p. 87 Sacramento grew interconnected with nearby cities like San Francisco, Chico, and Stockton as the automobile continued to grow in popularity; the first bus route in the city opened in between Sacramento and Folsom in 1910, prior to World War I, and, three years prior, the passage of a bond issue made possible the pavement of roads interconnecting settlements in Sacramento County. Wisconsin and Illinois native Arthur Serviss Dudley, who was elected as the executive secretary of the Sacramento Chamber of Commerce, set the city to host the Days of '49 festival in 1922 as a means to convince the city to unite in efforts for urban improvement.Avella, p. 88 A 1915 proposal to filtrate the impure Sacramento tap water passed, and president Calvin Coolidge ceremoniously activated the purification system from Washington, D.C. in 1923.Avella, p. 94 The same year, Sacramento voters approved the creation of SMUD, or the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, a publicly owned utility company which competed with the privately owned Pacific Gas and Electric and Great Western Utility companies.Avella, p.93-94 Sacramento City College was founded in 1916 as the oldest institute of higher education in Sacramento, initially meeting in the upper rooms of Sacramento High School until a bond issue allowed them to construct a new facility when the Sacramento High School moved to a new high school in 1924.Avella, p. 92-93 The campus was moved to its present location on Freeport Boulevard two years later, alongside a grant that permitted the Sacramento City Unified School District to construct six elementary schools in 1921.Avella, p. 92 World War II and the Great Depression ‚Äì 1931 to 1945 Tower Bridge, which was completed in 1935. The Great Depression struck Sacramento alongside the rest of the United States in 1929, driving approximately 15,000 Sacramentans into unemployment by 1932. The local canning industry was affected first as demand for canned goods dropped drastically, laying off workers; a freeze later destroyed half of the Sacramento area's citrus trees in December 1932. Hoovervilles, or large shantytowns created without official authority by homeless people, began appearing across the city.Avella, p. 98 The city of Sacramento in itself did not have to deal with transient vagrants since that was handled by the county government. However, since both entities relied on charities to supply their relief programs, most of the Sacramento area's government-funded programs were discontinued after local charitable organizations began to collapse. When the relief cash flow was stopped, the county's unemployed united to form an Unemployed Council in attempts to pressure the Sacramentan government to increase relief money. The city and county did not comply sufficiently, and large parties of unemployed stormed the Sacramento welfare offices in early and mid-1933.Avella, p. 100-101 Many of the unemployed who were involved in such activities were labeled as communist or socialist and jailed on a wide range of charges stemming from the communist scare that had set upon the city.Avella, p. 101 A drastic loss in tax money contributed to Sacramento's application to President Herbert Hoover's Reconstruction Finance Corporation; while this stemmed some economic growth, Sacramento was largely uninvolved with programs in Washington, D.C. until Franklin D. Roosevelt's election to the presidency in 1932. New Deal programs impacted Sacramento's economy greatly; the State Employment Relief Administration and Public Works Administration approved loans for construction and employment in the city.Avella, p. 102 Initially, long-distance travel was accomplished by train and steamship travel while automobiles composed much local traffic. To accommodate railroad and automobile traffic westwards from the city's downtown across the Sacramento River, the Tower Bridge was erected in 1935; the completion of the bridge facilitated travel between Sacramento and West Sacramento.Hendricks (Old Sacramento and Downtown), p. 57 The bridge, which was funded by the Works Progress Administration, was one of a number of WPA-funded projects, which included of highway, 46 public buildings, and new runways at local airports. An additional economic boost was provided in the construction of McClellan Air Force Base, which began in 1936 and was completed in 1939, and the reopening of the previously closed Mather AFB in 1936.Avella, p. 104 Additionally, the Sacramento Army Depot was opened in 1942 and later became a major communications equipment repair station under the control of the Signal Corps by 1945.Avella, p. 105 Pearl Harbor, a deep-water military port nearby Honolulu, Hawaii, was subject to a surprise attack on the morning of December 7, 1941; McClellan AFB was active by 2 pm that day, and hundreds of B-26 Marauders and Curtiss P-40s were being readied for battle, destined for assignment in Alaska. Meanwhile, the city government formulated emergency plans; mayor Thomas Monk increased security around public buildings and kept careful watch over the levees on the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The city's first mandated blackout day was on December 8, although the blackouts over Sacramento were not organized or coordinated well until an ordinance issued by Sacramento County established a system to inform its residents accurately when blackouts would start and end.Avella, p. 106 Rationing and conservation of resources impacted the Sacramentan economy significantly; the federal government confiscated 85% of retail profits for war.Avella, p. 107 Executive Order 9066 was implemented in February 1942, which stated that \\"any and all persons may be excluded\\" from \\"military zones,\\" which were stated to be the western region of Pacific Coast states and in Arizona. A crackdown followed the issue of the order almost immediately; Japanese businessmen and workers were arrested, Japanese-owned businesses were liquidated, and Japanese-owned financial assets were frozen. Internment processes followed suit one month later when Sacramento was placed into a military zone as dictated by Order 9066.Avella, p. 108 1946 to present California State University, Sacramento main entrance Sacramento's preeminent university, California State University, Sacramento (alias Sac State), was founded in 1947. In 1966, Sacramento was the endpoint of a civil rights march of the United Farm Workers (UFW) led by Cesar Chavez. In the 1990s Joe Serna, Sacramento's first Hispanic mayor, named a park in Downtown Sacramento after Ch√°vez.July 4 on Sacramento River 2002 The Sacramento Kings NBA basketball franchise moved to Sacramento in 1985, and are currently Sacramento's only major professional sports team, though the city is home 2 professional minor league franchises, Sacramento Republic FC and the Sacramento River Cats. A new arena for the Kings, Golden 1 Center, was built in time for the opening of the 2016-2017 NBA season, and it appears to be fostering in a new era of growth in Sacramento. Sacramento Republic FC is expected to secure a MLS expansion bid, and build a privately owned stadium in the railyards area. Despite recent economic woes, Sacramento is still growing very rapidly, and new homes continue to be built in the city as well as in rapidly expanding suburbs such as Natomas Elk Grove, Folsom, Roseville, Citrus Heights, Rocklin, Lincoln, and Rancho Cordova. One plan for the city's future suggests building a massive park in Downtown Sacramento called Gold Rush Park which would rival in size the largest municipal parks in the nation.

Life and career Frank Mankiewicz was born in New York City and grew up in Beverly Hills, California, the son of Sara (Aaronson) and screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, who co-wrote Citizen Kane. His uncle, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, directed such films as All About Eve and Cleopatra. His brother was television writer Don Mankiewicz. They grew up near the Marx Brothers, and Harpo Marx was a presence at Mankiewicz family Passover Seders. \\"He would pick up the Paschal lamb bone and lead a parade around the table,\\" Frank Mankiewicz recalled. He briefly attended Haverford College before dropping out to join the army infantry during World War II and fought in the Battle of the Bulge. After the war, Mankiewicz received a Bachelor of Arts in political science from University of California, Los Angeles in 1947; a master's degree from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in 1948; and an LL.B. from University of California, Berkeley in 1955. He was president of National Public Radio from 1977 to 1983, overseeing the creation of Morning Edition and the expansion of the network. He resigned due to a $6 million debt that required NPR to be bailed out by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and member stations. He had also served as regional director for the Peace Corps in Latin America, presidential campaign press secretary in 1968 to U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy, D-N.Y, and campaign director for 1972 Democratic presidential nominee George McGovern. Mankiewicz is a recurring figure in Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72. Thompson describes him more positively than many other political operatives, though Mankiewicz is jokingly outraged by Thompson's characterization of him as a \\"rumpled little man who looked like a used-car salesman.\\" =RFK assassination= On June 5, 1968, at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California, U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy, having won the California primary election during his 1968 campaign for the U.S. presidency and given his victory speech, was gunned down just after midnight in the kitchen area as he was heading for a press conference. The Senator was taken first to Central Receiving Hospital, then Good Samaritan Hospital. Once Kennedy was admitted to GSH, news correspondents set up temporary press headquarters in a nearby gymnasium. Throughout the day, Mankiewicz provided medical bulletins to the press as received. One of his first reports came after 7 a.m., approximately four hours after surgery was completed to remove fragments of the bullet from Kennedy's brain; Mankiewicz reported that his vital signs were impaired but the senator was breathing on his own. However, by 1:30 p.m., Kennedy's condition had been downgraded from \\"critical\\" to \\"extremely critical\\". Several hours later, Mankiewicz returned to the press headquarters with this report: > The team of physicians attending Senator Robert Kennedy is concerned over > his continuing failure to show improvement during the post-operative period. > Senator Kennedy's condition is still described as extremely critical. There > will be no further regular bulletins until early tomorrow morning. At 1:59 a.m. the next morning, a physically and emotionally exhausted Mankiewicz appeared before the news press and, remaining composed, relayed what turned out to be the final report: > I have, uh, a short ‚Äî I have a short announcement to read, which I will > read, uh ‚Äî at this time. Senator Robert Francis Kennedy died at 1:44 a.m. > today, June 6, 1968. With Senator Kennedy at the time of his death were his > wife Ethel, his sisters Mrs. Stephen Smith, Mrs. Patricia Lawford, his > brother-in-law Mr. Stephen Smith, and his sister-in-law Mrs. John F. > Kennedy. He was 42 years old. Thank you. =Later years= His work in politics earned him a place on the master list of Nixon's political opponents. He was also an unsuccessful candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in Maryland in 1976. In 1974, Mankiewicz acted as a secret emissary, carrying messages from Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to Fidel Castro, and then reporting back to Kissinger. In January 1975, Mankiewicz and Lawrence Eagleburger held a clandestine meeting with Castro's representative Ram√≥n S√°nchez-Parodi at LaGuardia airport. This secret diplomacy failed to produce a political breakthrough.LeoGrande, William and Kornbluh, Peter; Back Channel to Cuba; pp. 119‚Äì120; 128‚Äì134; University of North Carolina; 2015 An animated parody of him appeared in the Comedy Central television series Freak Show as a parking garage attendant at the Pentagon. In 1984, Frank Mankiewicz wrote for Quarante magazine owned by Kathleen Katz of Arlington. A piece he wrote for Quarante in 1985 was one of the first to point out how television coverage of politics had changed. The article was titled, \\"Politics and Media: In Search of An Angle\\". He wrote: > As part-time advisor to Senator Gary Hart's presidential campaign in 1984 ‚Äî > the first I had participated in actively since 1972 ‚Äî I was struck by the > minutiae of the press's questions. The authorship of a speech ‚Äî the identity > of the speechwriters ‚Äî seemed far more important than its content. Strategy > was a primary concern ‚Äî which votes are being sought? How much money has > been raised for television commercials? Who will produce the commercials? > ... Rarely if ever does the question turn on such things as \\"does he have > the right ideas?\\" or \\"would he make a strong ‚Äî or even good ‚Äî president?\\" Mankiewicz lived in Washington, D.C. with his wife, novelist Patricia O'Brien, who also writes under the pseudonym of Kate Alcott. His son Josh Mankiewicz is an NBC News correspondent, while his son Ben Mankiewicz is a Turner Classic Movies host and a host on The Young Turks, who also served from September 2008 to September 2009 as co-host (with Ben Lyons) of At The Movies. Both Josh and Ben Mankiewicz live in Los Angeles. = Anti-metrication = According to Mankiewicz, he prompted Lyn Nofziger's efforts to halt the 1970s U.S. metrication effort, who convinced President Ronald Reagan to shut down the United States Metric Board. = Books = In 2016, Mankiewicz's memoir was published So As I Was Saying . . .My Somewhat Eventful Life, with coauthor Joel Swerdlow (Thomas Dunne). Death Mankiewicz died in Washington, D.C. on October 23, 2014, at the age of 90. His son, Ben, stated that he died of internal bleeding, while son Josh, an NBC News correspondent, and family spokesman Adam Clymer, a former New York Times reporter, both said the reason for his hospitalization had been heart and lung problems, and that he had died of heart failure.

The New Yorker magazine wrote: \\"Superlatives are increasingly difficult to back up, since most of the world speaks and tweets in exclamation points by now, but I think it‚Äôs safe to say that the director Lee Breuer‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Gospel at Colonus‚Äù is a masterpiece. I first saw it at BAM in 1983, when it premi√®red, and I left the theatre with my shirtfront drenched with tears and the perspiration of relief: here was a portrait of black life‚Äîof black music, joy, and pain‚Äîthat I could understand. Brilliantly recasting Sophocles‚Äô tragedy ‚ÄúOedipus at Colonus‚Äù as a Pentecostal sermon, Breuer and his incredible composer, Bob Telson, got at the heart of difference and history and how the two helped create America. A limited run of free shows at the Public's Delacorte Theatre, Sept. 4‚Äì9, features the legendary groups the Blind Boys of Alabama and the Original Soul Stirrers.\\" ‚Äî Hilton Als Overview Breuer and Telson handed the storytelling duties to a black Pentecostal preacher and the choir of his church, who in turn enacted the story of Oedipus's torment and redemption as a modern parable. They employed the unusual device of casting The Blind Boys of Alabama to collectively portray Oedipus as well as the Institutional Radio Choir in Brooklyn and Chancel Choir of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem. Other casting innovations in the performance include multiple actors in single roles, such as when The Messenger is called upon to assume the role of Oedipus in tandem with the singer cast when the role calls for stage motion that would be difficult for the blind singer to negotiate alone, the multiplicity of Oedipus's daughters and one son when the children of Oedipus appear collectively (with Jevetta Steele as Ismene, her sister Jearlyn Steele doubling for actress Isabell O'Connor as Antigone, and brothers J.D. and Fred Steele standing in as Polynices and Eteocles, with actor Kevin Davis doubling as Polynices), and, indeed, with different portions of the cast, singly and in groups, assuming the duties of the traditional Greek chorus. The New York Times's Mel Gussow has expressed the view that the result was the translation of the Greek myth into a Christian parable. In his review of the BAM production, Gussow noted: \\"It is surprising how organically \\"Oedipus\\" can fit within the framework of a gospel musical... the evening has the shape of a church service.\\"Gussow, Mel. The Gospel at Colonus, The New York Times Guide to the Arts of the 20th Century: 1900-1929, Taylor & Francis, 2002, , pp. 2785-2786 While the traditions of Greek theater as religious ritual are unfamiliar to modern audiences, Gospel at Colonus reaffirms those possibilities by its use of call-and-response and ecstatic, sung re-enactment of a culturally important story. Television and film In 1985 PBS televised the original Brooklyn Academy of Music production, as presented by the American Music Theater Festival at the Annenberg Center in Philadelphia, as part of the Great Performances series. The performers included Morgan Freeman as The Messenger, Carl Lumbly as Theseus, Jevetta Steele as Ismene, and Robert Earl Jones as Creon. In the 1985 incarnation, The Soul Stirrers (credited collectively) and the Institutional Radio Choir assume roles as citizens of Colonus. In 1995 WHYY/Philadelphia aired a one hour special, The Peoples Gospel at Colonus, highlighting Director Danny Fruchter's thought that Greek Theatre and the African American Church reflect ideas about community essential to both cultures. This community involvement, in fact the chorus making the story, was central to his 1995 production at the People's Light and Theatre Co. during the 3rd Annual FreeFest, in which all tickets were free and most performers were part of the same town of nearby Coatesville, PA.

History Henley Beach was named for the English town of Henley-on-Thames, the home town of Sir Charles Cooper, South Australia's first judge. Cooper had a residence in the area adjacent Charles Sturt's property \\"The Grange\\", for which Grange Beach was named. It has been asserted that Sturt's suggestion of \\"Cooper's Beach\\" was rejected by Cooper, who gave it the current name. The Town of Henley Beach was promoted in the South Australian Register in 1860 as being \\"free from all the noxious smells which have been cause of complaint elsewhere\\". The Register again advertised the township in 1874: Geography Henley Beach lies between the suburbs of West Beach and Grange. Demographics The 2006 Census by the Australian Bureau of Statistics counted 5,405 persons in Henley Beach on census night. Of these, 49.9% were male and 50.1% were female. The majority of residents (73.6%) are of Australian birth, with a further 6.8% identifying England as their country of origin.

They were created for various media series. Among them are: * Anthony \\"Henry\\" Harper (appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man, voiced by David Lodge): Nothing much is known about District Attorney Henry Harper's past. In one side-mission in the game, he is kidnapped by the supervillain Iguana and is dragged into the sewers through the train docking station. After saving a civilian, Spider-Man learns that Harper was a pawn for Oscorp. After Spider-Man defeats Iguana, Harper is rescued and he escapes out of the sewers. Sometime before the events of the game, Harper had focused on exposing Quest Aerospace's evil schemes after he successfully prosecuted some of the city's most notorious criminals. The corrupt corporation lost millions of dollars to Harper, but they fired back when they had evidence of funds contributed to the D.A.'s reelection campaign were sourced by Oscorp Industries. These allegations were never revealed, but Harper's reputation was severely damaged in the eyes of many citizens. He is not seen in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, but he is mentioned when Spider-Man tells the Shocker that he could get into protective custody in exchange for telling Harper about the gang war. * Dr. Watts (appeared in Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro voiced by Jennifer Hale): Dr. Watts (first name unknown) is a prominent scientist. She is the creator of the Bio-Nexus Device and a world- renowned scholar of biology. In the game, she is kidnapped by Hammerhead while attending the Science Industry Ball. During Spider-Man's fight with Hammerhead, Dr. Watts disappears, which led Spider-Man to believe that the Sandman took her. Due to an anonymous tip, Spider-Man tracks Dr. Watts to a museum, where she is taken hostage by Electro. After Electro leaves the museum, Dr. Watts tells Spider-Man that Electro went to the Twin Towers. * Detective Terri Lee (appeared in Spider-Man voiced by Dawnn Lewis): She is a detective for the New York Police Department. Naturally, she investigates cases that involve Spider-Man and to an extent to Peter Parker, though she never found out Peter and Spider-Man are the same person. She didn't trust Spider-Man at first, but overtime she began accepting Spider-Man as an ally. She has ties to Carnage and she had a relationship with the vampire hunter Blade. * Indira \\"Indy\\" Daimonji (appeared in Spider-Man: The New Animated Series voiced by Angella Brooks): She is Peter Parker's potential love interest and a rival of Mary Jane Watson. She works at a news network down in Manhattan. She is seriously injured by Spider-Man in the series finale when Spider-Man is tricked by the Gaines Twins into injuring Indy. This led to Peter giving up being Spider-Man * Whitney Chang (appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man and The Amazing Spider-Man 2, voiced by Claudia Black in the first video game and by Sumalee Montano in the second video game): She is a top investigative reporter for the Channel 3 News Network and is well known for putting herself at risk for finding out the truth. She met Spider-Man in person while she was investigating a secret Oscorp facility involving cross- species genetics and its connection with Alistair Smythe, with Spider-Man tracking down a crate with Dr. Connor's research to create the cure. Whitney gave Spider-Man her camera and asks him to take photos exposing Oscorp's research. As explained in her bio, Chang grew up in the Sunset Park region of Brooklyn, New York, where she witnessed a neighbor being murdered by an angry mob after being framed for murder and being slandered by the news for days. After graduating from Yale, she quits her job as the host of a music video channel and snuck aboard a flight to Iraq, arriving just as American troops invade Baghdad. In The Amazing Spider-Man 2, through unspecified circumstances, Whitney leaves her job at the Channel 9 News Network and now works at the Daily Bugle. She works with Daily Bugle newcomer Peter Parker to expose Wilson Fisk as the Kingpin. Her role in Amazing Spider-Man 2 is lessened compared to its predecessor. * Michelle Jones (appeared in the Marvel Cinematic Universe): More commonly known as MJ, is an original character portrayed by Zendaya in the films Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider- Man: Far From Home (2019).

It is similar to the (standard) Euler method, but differs in that it is an implicit method. The backward Euler method has error of order one in time.  Description  Consider the ordinary differential equation : \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} y}{\\\\mathrm{d} t} = f(t,y) with initial value y(t_0) = y_0. Here the function f and the initial data t_0 and y_0 are known; the function y depends on the real variable t and is unknown. A numerical method produces a sequence y_0, y_1, y_2, \\\\ldots such that y_k approximates y(t_0+kh) , where h is called the step size. The backward Euler method computes the approximations using : y_{k+1} = y_k + h f(t_{k+1}, y_{k+1}). This differs from the (forward) Euler method in that the latter uses f(t_k, y_k) in place of f(t_{k+1}, y_{k+1}). The backward Euler method is an implicit method: the new approximation y_{k+1} appears on both sides of the equation, and thus the method needs to solve an algebraic equation for the unknown y_{k+1} . For non-stiff problems, this can be done with fixed- point iteration: : y_{k+1}^{[0]} = y_k, \\\\quad y_{k+1}^{[i+1]} = y_k + h f(t_{k+1}, y_{k+1}^{[i]}). If this sequence converges (within a given tolerance), then the method takes its limit as the new approximation y_{k+1} . Alternatively, one can use (some modification of) the Newton‚ÄìRaphson method to solve the algebraic equation.  Derivation  Integrating the differential equation \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} y}{\\\\mathrm{d} t} = f(t,y) from t_n to t_{n+1} = t_n + h yields : y(t_{n+1}) - y(t_n) = \\\\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} f(t, y(t)) \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}t. Now approximate the integral on the right by the right-hand rectangle method (with one rectangle): : y(t_{n+1}) - y(t_n) \\\\approx h f(t_{n+1}, y(t_{n+1})). Finally, use that y_n is supposed to approximate y(t_n) and the formula for the backward Euler method follows. The same reasoning leads to the (standard) Euler method if the left-hand rectangle rule is used instead of the right-hand one.  Analysis  The pink region outside the disk shows the stability region of the backward Euler method. The backward Euler method has order one. This means that the local truncation error (defined as the error made in one step) is O(h^2) , using the big O notation. The error at a specific time t is O(h) . The region of absolute stability for the backward Euler method is the complement in the complex plane of the disk with radius 1 centered at 1, depicted in the figure. This includes the whole left half of the complex plane, making it suitable for the solution of stiff equations. In fact, the backward Euler method is even L-stable. The region for a discrete stable system by Backward Euler Method is a circle with radius 0.5 which is located at (0.5, 0) in the z-plane.Wai-Kai Chen, Ed., Analog and VLSI Circuits The Circuits and Filters Handbook, 3rd ed. Chicago, USA: CRC Press, 2009.  Extensions and modifications  The backward Euler method is a variant of the (forward) Euler method. Other variants are the semi-implicit Euler method and the exponential Euler method. The backward Euler method can be seen as a Runge‚ÄìKutta method with one stage, described by the Butcher tableau: : \\\\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} The backward Euler method can also be seen as a linear multistep method with one step. It is the first method of the family of Adams‚ÄìMoulton methods, and also of the family of backward differentiation formulas. See also *Crank‚ÄìNicolson method  Notes   References  * .

Facts The Commonwealth passed an amendment modifying the Migration Act 1958. The amendment imposed a fee on all persons entering Australia for immigration clearance. The implementation of such a scheme meant that airline operators would have to make payments to the Commonwealth government. Decision The High Court unanimously held that the fee for migration clearance was a tax. If section 55 of the Australian Constitution (which requires that legislation imposing tax deals only with imposing tax) is read literally, the effect of this decision would have invalidated the rest of the Migration Act. The Court was thus careful to invalidate only the Amending Act. The migration clearance fee was a tax because it has all the positive attributes of a tax. It was: * compulsory; * exacted by a public authority for public purposes enforceable by law; * not a fee for services. The court also provided some guidance as to the characteristics of a tax: * a fee could be considered a tax even if it was collected by a private entity not properly described as public * the liability must be imposed in relation to some ascertainable criteria The court also made a distinction between citizens and non-citizens. An Australian citizen cannot be stopped from entering Australia, so although they paid the clearance fee, no service was being rendered to them. Hence the fee paid could not have been a fee for a service.  See also  * Constitutional basis of taxation in Australia * Australian constitutional law  References  * Winterton, G. et al.

It was built as part of a complex during the Zand dynasty. It is named after Karim Khan, and served as his living quarters. It is rectangular in shape and resembles a medieval fortress. In the past, the citadel was sometimes used as a prison. Today, it is a museum operated by Iran's Cultural Heritage Organization. A public park surrounds it. History Karim Khan citadel is located at the beginning of Karim Khan Zand (Shiraz) street on the corner of the Municipality Square (Shahrdari). Karim Khan was influenced by the Safavid architecture when his government was established in Shiraz. So that after visiting Isfahan Naghshe Jahan Square, he decided to build a large square in the northern Shiraz. This field was known as Artillery Square. To the north of the Square, located Divan Karim Khan Square and to its east, Vakil Bazaar and several inns. To the south of the Square, were located Hammam Vakil and Vakil Mosque. On the southwest, there was a garden, and to the west, the Arg citadel. After the conquest of Shiraz by Mohammad Khan, he decided to demolish the buildings of Karim Khan in a hostility to Karim Khan. Following this decision, a number of Zandiyah era buildings were demolished, including the border fence built around Shiraz by Karim Khan. Fortunately, the Arg citadel was protected from demolition and was used as an emirate court appointed by the central government to Amiri and the Fars governorate. fa.tripyar.com The Arg of Karim Khan was built in 1180 AH (1766-7). Karim Khan invited the best architects and artists of the time and bought the best materials from other cities and abroad for the construction of the castle of Karim Khan, which was quickly constructed. During the Zand dynasty it was used by the king as living quarters. During the Qajar period it was used as the governor's seat. Prince Abdolhosein Mirza Farmanfarma, governor of Fars Province, ordered the miniatures in the castle to be renovated. After the fall of the Qajar Dynasty it was converted into a prison and the paintings were plastered over. In 1971 it was given to Iran's Cultural Heritage Organization. The renovation of the castle started in 1977. Description Karim Khan Castle is located at Shahrdari Square. It has a land area of 4,000 m2 and is in the center of a 12,800 m2 compound.retrieved 11 Feb 2008 The Citadel of Karim Khan consists of four high walls connected by four 14 m round brick towers at a 90-degree angle. Each 12 m wall is carnalized and is 3 meters thick at the base and 2.8 meters at the top. The design of the citadel combines military and residential architecture, for it was the home of Karim Khan and the military center of the dynasty. James Edward Alexander in 1827 described the citadel as being surrounded by a \\"deep wet ditch\\".James Edward Alexander, Travels from India to England: Comprehending a Visit to the Burman Empire, Parbury, Allen (1827) p.125 Tile works depicting legendary tales were added at the entrance gate of the citadel during the Qajar Era.

Facts Entores was a London-based trading company that sent an offer by telex for the purchase of copper cathodes from a company based in Amsterdam. The Dutch company sent an acceptance by telex. The contract was not fulfilled and so Entores attempted to sue the owner of the Dutch company for damages. The controlling company, Entores, was based in the UK and under English law Entores could only bring the action in the UK (serve notice of writ outside the jurisdiction) if it could prove that the contract was formed within the jurisdiction, i.e. in London rather than Amsterdam. Judgment Denning LJ, delivered the leading judgment. He said that the postal rule could not apply to instantaneous communications, such as telephone or telex: if a phoneline \\"went dead\\" just before the offeree said \\"yes\\", it would be absurd to assume that the contract was formed and the parties would not have to call each other back. The same applied to telex. Since the contract was therefore only formed when and where the telex was received, the place of formation was London.

Synopsis  Blair plays Shawn, a loan officer at a bank who is having an affair with the bank‚Äôs married vice-president. After discovering that his wife is pregnant, Shawn has a meltdown and goes to the roof to kill herself. At the same time, bank robbers hijack an armored car. When the police arrive to stop Shawn from jumping, one of the bank robbers (Thompson) accidentally gets caught. The cops thwart the robbery, but one of the robbers, Charlie Anders (Beesley), takes Shawn hostage at gunpoint. They make a deal: she will help him escape if he promises to kill her afterwards. Production A large number of filter effects, shutter effects, and jump cuts are used to make long dialogue scenes (particularly between the two cops and between the two lovers) more visually interesting. The audio itself on both is done as a single long take. Dana Lustig, the director, makes an on screen appearance as Shawn's stepmother. It was filmed in Canada. =Soundtrack= Kill Me Laters opening theme was the dream pop song \\"The Old Fashioned Way\\" by the New York-based band Luna. In 2005 the German Industrial metal band Rammstein released Spring. Although the song did not have a promotional music video, an unofficial version which features scenes from the film Kill Me Later, became one of the most watched videos of the band on the Internet.

Latin deus and dƒ´vus (\\"divine\\") are in turn descended from Proto-Indo-European *deiwos, \\"celestial\\" or \\"shining\\", from the same root as *Dyƒìus, the reconstructed chief god of the Proto-Indo-European pantheon. In Classical Latin, deus (feminine dea) was a general nounGenerale nomen: Servius, note to Aeneid 12.139. referring to a deity, while in technical usage a divus or diva was a figure who had become divine, such as a divinized emperor. In Late Latin, Deus came to be used mostly for the Christian God. It was inherited by the Romance languages in Galician and Portuguese Deus, Catalan and Sardinian D√©u, French and Occitan Dieu, Friulian and Sicilian Diu, Italian Dio, Spanish Dios and (for the Jewish God) Ladino ◊ì◊ô◊ô◊ï/◊ì◊ô◊ï Dio/Dyo, etc., and by the Celtic languages in Welsh Duw and Irish Dia. Cognates While Latin deus can be translated as and bears superficial similarity to Greek Œ∏ŒµœåœÇ the√≥s, meaning \\"god\\", it should be warned these are false cognates. A true cognate is Ancient Greek Zeus, king of the Olympian gods in Greek mythology (, or ; , ). In the archaic period, the initial Zeta would have been pronounced such that Attic ŒñŒµœçœÇ would phonetically transliterate as Zde√∫s or Dze√∫s, from Proto-Hellenic *dz√©us. By combining a form of deus with the Ancient Roman word for \\"father\\" (, ), one derives the name of the mythical Roman equivalent of Zeus: the sky god Diespiter (), later called Iuppiter or J≈´piter, from Proto-Italic *djous patƒìr, descended from Proto-Indo-European root *Dy·∏óws*Paht·∏ór literally meaning 'Sky Father'. From the same root is derived the Greek vocative \\"O father Zeus\\" (), and whence is also derived the name of the Hindu sky god Dy√°u·π£ Pit·πõÃÅ (Vedic Sanskrit: , ), and Proto-Germanic *Tƒ´waz or Tius hence Old Norse T√Ωr. Latin Bible Latin Deus consistently translates Greek ŒòŒµœåœÇ The√≥s in both the Vetus Latina and Jerome's Vulgate. In the Septuagint, Greek The√≥s in turn renders Hebrew Elohim (◊ê÷±◊ú◊ï÷π◊î÷¥◊ô◊ù, ◊ê◊ú◊î◊ô◊ù), as in Genesis 1:1: * Masoretic Text * Septuagint * Vulgate * In theological terminology The word de-us is the root of deity, and thereby of deism, pandeism, and polydeism, all of which are theories in which any divine figure is absent from intervening in human affairs. This curious circumstance originates from the use of the word \\"deism\\" in the 17th and 18th centuries as a contrast to the prevailing \\"theism\\", belief in an actively intervening God: Followers of these theories, and occasionally followers of pantheism, may sometimes refer to God as \\"Deus\\" or \\"the Deus\\" to make clear that the entity being discussed is not a theistic \\"God\\". Arthur C. Clarke picks up this usage in his novel 3001: The Final Odyssey. William Blake said of the Deists that they worship \\"the Deus of the Heathen, The God of This World, & the Goddess Nature, Mystery, Babylon the Great, The Druid Dragon & hidden Harlot\\".Samuel Foster Damon, Morris Eaves, A Blake dictionary: the ideas and symbols of William Blake, 1988, page 103. In Cartesian philosophy, the phrase deus deceptor is sometimes used to discuss the possibility of an evil God that seeks to deceive us. This character is related to a skeptical argument as to how much we can really know if an evil demon were attempting to thwart our knowledge. Another is the deus otiosus (\\"idle god\\"), which is a creator god who largely retires from the world and is no longer involved in its daily operation. A similar concept is that of the deus absconditus (\\"hidden god\\") of Thomas Aquinas. Both refer to a deity whose existence is not readily knowable by humans through either contemplation or examination of divine actions. The concept of deus otiosus often suggests a god who has grown weary from involvement in this world and who has been replaced by younger, more active gods, whereas deus absconditus suggests a god who has consciously left this world to hide elsewhere. Latin phrases with \\"deus\\" Statue of Archangel Michael slaying Satan represented as a dragon. Quis ut Deus? (\\"Who is like God?\\") is inscribed on his shield. Nobiscum deus (\\"God with us\\") was a battle cry of the late Roman Empire and of the Byzantine Empire. The name Amadeus translates to \\"for love of God\\". The genitive/dative dei occurs in such phrases as Roman Catholic organization Opus Dei (work of God), Agnus Dei (Lamb of God) and Dei Gratia (By the Grace of God). *Agnus Dei *Deus ex machina *Deus otiosus/Deus absconditus *Deus sive Natura *Deus vult *Divs *Munificentissimus Deus *Opus Dei *Providentissimus Deus *Rector Potens, Verax Deus *Regnator omnium deus *Rerum Deus Tenax Vigor *Rex Deus *Sublimus Dei *Te Deum *Unigenitus dei filius *Vox populi, vox Dei See also * God (word) (the Germanic word) References Category:Latin words and phrases Category:Names of God ","title":"Deus"},{"id":"5662358","text":"\\"Grendel\\" is an English language science fiction short story written in 1968 by Larry Niven. It is the fourth in the series of Known Space stories featuring crashlander Beowulf Shaeffer. The short story was originally published in Neutron Star (1968), and reprinted in Crashlander (1994). It has no connection to the creatures called Grendels in Niven's Heorot series. Synopsis Beowulf \\"Bey\\" Shaeffer is on a flight between Down and Gummidgy when the ship's captain, Margo Tellefsen, announces that she is dropping of out hyperdrive so passengers can witness a starseed setting sail. Just after this happens, all passengers are knocked out by a gas introduced in the ship's life system; while no cargo is missing, a Kdatlyno touch sculptor named Lloobee has vanished. Soon enough, the kidnappers make contact with the local government and demand ten million \\"stars\\" (the interstellar form of currency) for Lloobee's safe return. Because Kdatlyno cannot spend extended time in small space ships (Margo mentioned seeing a large yacht before passing out), Shaeffer reasons that Lloobee's kidnappers must have taken him onto the planet. After looking through spaceport records, Shaeffer and fellow passenger Emil Horne reason that the most likely ship to have carried Lloobee was Drunkard's Walk, a ship owned by Larchmont Bellamy, an acquaintance of Shaeffer's. At Emil's insistence, the two briefly visit Bellamy's hunting camp. After dinner, Emil and Shaeffer say their goodbyes and leave. However, after flying over the horizon, Shaeffer drops the ship almost to ground level and subsonic speed, turning back to the camp. He reasons that not only are Bellamy and crew the kidnappers, but that Margo must have helped them. On foot, they find the cave where Lloobee is being held but, before Shaeffer can explain that the Gummidgy MP's can take care of the matter from this point, Emil charges into the cave, revealing their position. Both are rendered unconscious and captured. When he awakens, Bellamy and his co-kidnappers openly discuss what to do about Shaeffer and his friend, thinking that he is still unconscious. They plan on faking their death by a carnivore. Lloobee suddenly leaps at one of the kidnappers, allowing Shaeffer a window to jump up and race out of the cave. He makes his way to the car, where he finds Bellamy waiting for him to appear. Because the goggles worn by everyone form a black protective dot over the sun, Shaeffer approaches the car with the sun at his back to cover his approach; he charges and the two fight hand-to-hand until Shaeffer runs into the car and takes off. Bellamy then comes after Shaeffer in Drunkard's Walk and attempts to force Shaeffer into landing by repeatedly slamming the car with sonic booms. Shaeffer flies his car into the flank of the larger ship. The resulting crash breaks the bones in his hands and damages his car enough to force it down, while Bellamy lands his still-functional yacht in order to finish off Shaeffer. However, Shaeffer notices that the impact has damaged the yacht's landing gear and it is being held upright only by its gyroscopes. Bellamy rushes back aboard to try to deal with this, but the gyros overload and seize up while he is still on the boarding ladder, causing the yacht to spin end-for-end and bounce off into the distance. Bellamy is thrown high into the air and to his death. Later, Shaeffer reveals to Margo that he knows of her involvement. She reveals in her turn that she is much older than she appears, and was Bellamy's mother; but she does not resent Shaeffer's part in his death, since she understood that he would certainly have run one deadly risk after another until he was inevitably killed. Instead, she asks him to stay with her until his lover on Earth, Sharrol, ends her two-year marriage contract with a local genius. Shaeffer agrees.

It belonged to the leaders of Qashqai tribe before being confiscated by the central government. The garden, and the building within it, are located at the northern shore of the Khoshk River in the Fars province. History Both the building and the garden were built during the middle of thirteenth century by the Ilkhanate or a paramount chief of the Qashqai tribes of Pars. The original layout of the garden however, with its quadripartite Persian paradise garden structure was most likely laid in eleventh century by the Seljuqs, and was then referred to as BƒÅgh-e ShƒÅh (\\"The emperor's garden\\" in Persian) and was much less complicated or ornamental. Cornelius de Bruyn, a traveller from the Netherlands, wrote a description of the gardens in the eighteenth century. Over its 150 years the structure has been modified, restored or stylistically changed by various participants. It was one of the properties of noble Shiraz Qavami Family. The building faces south along the long axis. It was designed by a local architect, Haji Mohammad Hasan. The structure housed 32 rooms on two stories, decorated by tiles with poems from the poet Hafez written on them. The structure underwent renovation during the Zand and Qajar dynasties. In 1965, Sir Denis Wright, a British ambassador in Iran, was invited by the Chancellor of Shiraz University, Asadollah Alam, to a party in Eram Garden for Princess Alexandra. The compound came under the protection of Pahlavi University during the Pahlavi era, and was used as the College of Law. The building also housed the Asia Institute. Today, Eram Garden and building are within Shiraz Botanical Garden (established 1983) of Shiraz University. They are open to the public as a historic landscape garden.

As a result, Hindu temples, Buddhist temples, Christian churches, synagogues, and Zoroastrian fire temples were converted into mosques.

Qur'anic holy sites alt= = Mecca = Muslims believe the mosque at Ka'ba was rebuilt and used for monotheistic worship since the time of Ibrahim and Ismail. Before Muhammad, the Ka øba and Mecca (referred to as Bakkah in the Quran), were revered as a sacred sanctuary and was a site of pilgrimage.Britannica 2002 Deluxe Edition CD-ROM, \\"Ka'bah.\\" Some identify it with the Biblical \\"valley of Baca\\" from Psalms 84 ()., King James Version At the time of Muhammad (AD 570‚Äì632), his tribe the Quraysh was in charge of the Ka øaba, which was at that time a shrine containing hundreds of idols representing Arabian tribal gods and other religious figures. Muhammad earned the enmity of his tribe by preaching the new religion of Islam. Early Muslims practiced, or attempted to practice, their rituals by the Ka'aba alongside polytheists, until they eventually left Mecca, driven out by escalating persecution. The aborted first pilgrimage, which was prevented by the Quraysh, who promised to allow it the following year in the Hudaybiyah treaty, did not also entail the prevention of continuing practices by polytheists. However, before the second pilgrimage season, allies of the Quraysh violated the treaty, allowing the Muslims to return as conquerors rather than guests. Henceforth, the Ka øaba was to be dedicated to the worship of the one God alone, and the idols were destroyed. The Black Stone (al-Hajar-ul-Aswad) at the Ka øaba was a special object of veneration at the site. According to some traditions the text of seven or ten especially honoured poems were suspended around the Ka øaba. = Jerusalem = alt= Upon the capture of Jerusalem, it is commonly reported that Umar, the Commander of the Faithful, refused to pray in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in spite of a treaty.Adrian Fortescue, \\"The Orthodox Eastern Church\\", Gorgias Press LLC, 1 December 2001, pg. 28 The architecturally similar Dome of the Rock was built on the Temple Mount, which was an abandoned and disused area since 70CE in the 7th century but which had previously been the site of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, the most sacred site in Judaism. Umar initially built there a small prayer house which laid the foundation for the later construction of the Al-Aqsa mosque by the Umayyads. = Elsewhere = The mosque of Job in Al-Shaykh Saad, Syria, was previously a church of Job. The Herodian shrine of the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, the second most holy site in Judaism, was converted into a church during the Crusades before being turned into a mosque in 1266 and henceforth banned to Jews and Christians. Part of it was restored as a synagogue by Israel after 1967. Other sites in Hebron have undergone Isalmification. The Tomb of Jesse and Ruth became the Church of the Forty Martyrs, which then became the Tomb of Isai and later Deir Al Arba'een. Hindu, Jain and Buddhist temples = Bindu Madhav (Nand Madho) Temple = The structure of Alamgir Mosque standing atop the original site of Bindu-Madhav temple in Varanasi The Alamgir Mosque in Varanasi was constructed by Mughal Emperor Aurnagzeb built atop the ancient 100 ft high Bindu Madhav (Nand Madho) Temple after its destruction in 1682. = Kashi Vishwanath Temple = The original Kashi Vishwanath Temple was demolished by Aurangzeb, the sixth Mughal emperor who constructed the Gyanvapi Mosque atop the original Hindu temple. Kashi Vishwanath was among the most renowned Hindu temples of India. Even today the pillars and the structure of the original temple can be clearly seen. Aurangzeb's demolition of the temple was motivated by the rebellion of local zamindars (landowners) associated with the temple, some of whom may have facilitated the escape of the Maratha king Shivaji. Jai Singh I, the grandson of the temple's builder Raja Man Singh, was widely believed to have facilitated Shivaji's escape from Agra. The temple's demolition was intended as a warning to the anti-Mughal factions and Hindu religious leaders in the city. As described by Jadunath Sarkar, on 9 April 1669, Aurangzeb issued a general order ‚Äúto demolish all the schools and temples of the infidels and to put down their religious teaching and practices.‚Äù His destroying hand now fell on the great shrines that commanded the veneration of the Hindus all over India‚Äîsuch as the second temple of Somnath, the Vishwanath temple of Benares and the Keshav Rai temple of Mathura. Sikh Gurdwaras =Gurdwara Lal Khoohi= Gurdwara Lal Khoohi in Lahore, Pakistan was a Sikh Gurdwara which was converted to muslim shrine. =Gurudwara Pehli Patshahi= Gurudwara Pehli Patshahi (Bhai Bala Di Baithak) dedicated to Bhai Bala was a Sikh Gurudwara at Balakot, Mansehra district of Pakistan which was converted into Bala Pir muslim shrine (Bala Pir Ziarat) after beheading of Syed Ahmad Barelvi by Sikh Empire forces in 1831 Battle of Balakot. Zoroastrian fire temples After the Islamic conquest of Persia, Zoroastrian fire temples, with their four axial arch openings, were usually turned into mosques simply by setting a mihrab (prayer niche) on the place of the arch nearest to qibla (the direction of Mecca). This practice is described by numerous Muslim sources; however, the archaeological evidence confirming it is still scarce. Zoroastrian temples converted into mosques in such a manner could be found in Bukhara, as well as in and near Istakhr and other Iranian cities, such as: Tarikhaneh Temple, Jameh Mosque of Qazvin, Heidarieh Mosque of Qazvin, Jameh Mosque of Isfahan, Jameh Mosque of Kashan, Jameh Mosque of Ardestan, Jameh Mosque of Yazd, Jameh Mosque of Borujerd, Great Mosque of Herat as well as Bibi Shahr Banu Shrine near Tehran.

After 1453 it became a mosque, and since 1931 it has been a museum in Istanbul, Turkey. From the date of its dedication in 360 until 1453, it served as the Orthodox cathedral of the imperial capital, except between 1204 and 1261, when it became the Roman Catholic cathedral under the Latin Patriarch of Constantinople of the Western Crusader- established Latin Empire. In 1453, Constantinople was conquered by the Ottoman Turks under Sultan Mehmed II, who subsequently ordered the building converted into a mosque. The bells, altar, iconostasis, ambo and sacrificial vessels were removed and many of the mosaics were plastered over. Islamic features ‚Äì such as the mihrab, minbar, and four minarets ‚Äì were added while in the possession of the Ottomans. The building was a mosque from 29 May 1453 until 1931, when it was secularised. It was opened as a museum on 1 February 1935. On July 10, 2020, the decision of the Council of Ministers to transform it into a museum was canceled by Council of State and the Turkish President Erdoƒüan signed a decree annulling the Hagia Sophia's museum status, reverting it to a mosque.https://www.aa.com.tr/tr/turkiye/ayasofyayi-camiden-muzeye- donusturen-bakanlar-kurulu-kararina-iptal-/1906077 * The Church of the Holy Apostles became the cathedral church and seat of the patriarchate for three years after the Fall of Constantinople, as Hagia Sophia became the city's Jama masjid.

It is part of the North Shore Railroad System. The line runs generally northeast between Tyrone (in Blair County) and Lock Haven (in Clinton County). Other communities served include Port Matilda, Milesburg (both in Centre County), and Mill Hall (in Clinton County). There is a spur at Milesburg that runs southeast to Bellefonte, then splits, with a track going northeast to Pleasant Gap and another going southwest to Lemont and State College (all in Centre County). There are of track in Blair County, in Centre County, and in Clinton County. The rail line follows Bald Eagle Creek northeast in Centre and Clinton counties, and runs roughly parallel to U.S. Route 220 between Tyrone and Milesburg, and parallel to Pennsylvania Route 150 between Milesburg and Lock Haven. The spur to Bellefonte follows Pennsylvania Route 144 and the line from Lemont to Pleasant Gap follows Pennsylvania Route 26. There are connections to the Norfolk Southern Railway at both Tyrone and Lock Haven as well as an indirect connection to Canadian Pacific Railway. The system has trackage rights via the Norfolk Southern line. These allow the Nittany and Bald Eagle Railroad to connect via Lock Haven to the east and south with the Lycoming Valley Railroad at Muncy and the village of Linden in Woodward Township, Lycoming County, the Union County Industrial Railroad at Milton, the North Shore Railroad at Northumberland, and the Shamokin Valley Railroad at Sunbury. History The line operated by the Nittany and Bald Eagle Railroad was formerly the Bald Eagle Valley Branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad Tyrone Division, later part of the Penn Central, and then Conrail. SEDA-COG JRA (Susquehanna Economic Development Association - Council of Governments Joint Rail Authority) was formed in July, 1983 to continue to provide rail service to communities whose rail lines Conrail had decided to abandon. In 1984 the JRA took over the line when Conrail abandoned it, and the Nittany and Bald Eagle Railroad was born (along with the North Shore Railroad). In 1989, more track was purchased, extending the Nittany and Bald Eagle line to Lock Haven. The name of the railroad comes from Mount Nittany in Centre County and Bald Eagle Creek. Bellefonte Historical Railroad Society (BHRS) The Bellefonte Historical Railroad is a tourist/excursion railroad that also uses the line operated by the Nittany and Bald Eagle Railroad. Because Norfolk Southern also uses the line increasingly for coal and other traffic, the Bellefonte Historical Railroad \\"is thought to be the only volunteer operation in the country that runs in conjunction with a Class I railroad\\". Unfortunately this also hampers their ability to operate on the main line at times, as Class I traffic has the right of way. The Bellefonte Historical Railroad has limited operations at this time and hosts special excursion runs. Their website is http://www.bellefontetrain.org.

The Bruin is the school's mascot. Broadneck is part of the Anne Arundel County Public Schools system and known for the breadth of its Advanced Placement program, among its higher level courses such as Linear Algebra. It has been the test school for courses such as Calculus III and offers options to take classes at the nearby Anne Arundel Community College and CAT-South schools. The Broadneck Bruins are rivals with the nearby Severna Park High School Falcons. The current BHS feeder middle schools are Severn River Middle School and Magothy River Middle School. Broadneck consistently ranks among the top high schools in Maryland and the nation. In 2018, Newsweek ranked Broadneck as one of the top 20 high schools in Maryland and top 1,000 in the country. In 2013, Broadneck received the highest rank by Newsweek out of all public High Schools in Anne Arundel County. Further, Broadneck High School also ranked among the top 300 high schools in the country by the Washington Post and among the top 10 high schools in Maryland History In the 1970s, nearby Severna Park High School was beginning to become overcrowded and was the only high school that served students on the Broadneck Peninsula at the time. In an attempt to solve overcrowding at Severna Park, Anne Arundel County Public Schools built Broadneck High School, which opened in January, 1982 for students in grades 10‚Äì12, and had a total of 310 students. The first principal was Lawrence E. Knight. The school chose its mascot as the Bruins and its colors as maroon, grey, and white, and the football stadium was named in honor of principal Lawrence E. Knight. In 1987, Broadneck began to experience overcrowding, and as a result, portable classrooms were added to the side of the school. An auditorium was also added to the school, a gravel pit was added near the softball fields to build more room for student parking, and Broadneck Athletics were added to the Anne Arundel County league. A fire also occurred in the English Department, resulting in the hospitalization of a teacher. Broadneck also became a smoke free school in 1987. In 1996, a large construction/expansion project began on the school building to allow room to add 9th graders to the school and in 1998 the project was finished and Broadneck opened its doors to its first freshman class. 2010 saw the addition of a two-story wing extension to the building. In 2017 the school unveiled a newly renovated athletics field house. It was named in honor of the school's first athletic director Tim McMullen.

Life Scott edited several liberal newspapers: The Statesman, which Leigh Hunt founded; the Stamford News, published by John Drakard; Drakard's Paper (a London edition of this), which he renamed The Champion; and the most notable, the London Magazine, which he revived, as a monthly, in January 1820. Under his direction, the magazine included works by such luminaries as Wordsworth, Charles Lamb, de Quincey, John Clare, Thomas Hood, Carlyle, Keats, Leigh Hunt, and Hazlitt. He also agreed to write a third of the magazine himself, which he did mostly under pseudonyms. He attended Aberdeen Grammar School, as did Lord Byron, who was some years younger; he spent 1795-8 at Marischal College, but left without graduating. When Byron published an account of his marriage in 1816, Scott called this publication indelicacy; Leigh Hunt quarreled with him over this. He died as the result of a duel, one of the side effects of the Cockney School controversy. John Gibson Lockhart had been abusing many of Scott's contributors in Blackwood's Magazine (under a pseudonym (Z), as was then common). In May 1820, Scott began a series of counter-articles, which provoked Lockhart into calling him \\"a liar and a scoundrel\\". In February 1820, Lockhart's London agent, Jonathan Henry Christie, made a provocative statement, and Scott challenged him. They met on 16 February 1821, at a farm between Camden Town and Hampstead. Christie did not fire in the first round, but there was a misunderstanding between the seconds, resulting in a second round. Scott was hit in the abdomen, and died 11 days later. Christie and his second were tried for wilful murder and acquitted; the collection for Scott's family was a notable radical cause.

Founded using Phillips alum and then-NBC president Robert Sarnoff's gift of $15,000, the station was launched in 1965 by a host of famous personalities, including Bob Hope, Jack Lemmon, David Brinkley, Sammy Davis Jr., and Hugh Downs. The station's signal was powered by a 33 watt transmitter and reached over 104 square kilometers, which, at launch, had the potential to reach over 150,000 people. History WPAA was licensed on April 26, 1965. It was a 10-watt station on 91.7 FM broadcasting from Evans Hall. The station later increased its power to 25 watts in 1984. In 2004, the Federal Communications Commission visited and inspected the Class D station, determining it was off the air for more than a year‚Äîcause for the deletion of its license. The Andover public school system had attempted to take over operations several years prior. With the deletion of the FM license, the station went Internet-only at WPAA.com. Additionally, Evans Hall was demolished in 2004, and the station was relocated to the basement of Morse Hall. The deletion of WPAA's license prompted two further changes. Commercial station WXRV relocated its city of license from Haverhill to Andover, becoming the first/only radio service for the town, and Newburyport's WNEF 91.7 altered its signal pattern to put more power toward Andover. Lowell's WUML was built with a directional signal to protect WPAA, which still is used.

It was written by lyricist E.Y. Harburg and composer Harold Arlen. The verse of the song suggests that the people of the city do no actual work, since they \\"get up at twelve, and start to work at one, take an hour for lunch, and then at two they're done\\". Their actions contradict that funny sentiment, however, as they are clearly doing plenty of work to \\"freshen up\\" the group of four to go see their desired person of the hour.

Biography Philip was born at the Cooper Grange Estate, South Naparima, in Trinidad. He was the illicit son of a white planter and an African-American woman from the Philip family.. After graduating from the small school at San Fernando, he went on at the age of 14 to St Mary's Catholic College in Scotland, where he received a classical education. After returning to Trinidad in 1849, he studied law for two years, then returned to England. In 1854, he was called to the bar. In the same year, he published his novel Emmanuel Appadocca, or, Blighted Life: A Tale of the Boucaneers, which is the first Trinidadian novel. Emmanuel Appadocca is about the illegitimate son of a rich father who owns his enslaved African mother. The protagonist avenges himself and his mother by showing that he is more ethical and more intelligent than his affluent father. C. L. R. James wrote in a 1931 article in The Beacon magazine that Philip was \\"the most brilliant native of his time and within memory\\" and that his book \\"shows the powerful effect with which the misfortune of his birth weighed upon his mind\\".. During the administration of A. H. Gordon from 1866 to 1870, Gordon appointed Philip as an \\"acting unofficial member\\" of Council. Gordon later appointed Philip as the acting Solicitor-General. In 1871, Philip became the Solicitor-General and stayed at the post until his death in 1888. In 1867, following an election, Philip became the Mayor of Port of Spain, a position that had previously been held by only whites. Bridget Brereton wrote in her 2002 book Race Relations in Colonial Trinidad 1870‚Äì1900 that \\"perhaps this marks the emergence of the coloured man as a political force in Trinidad\\". Philip's health began to weaken in 1887. He died at Maraval. 29 November was designated Maxwell Philip Day by the Port of Spain City Corporation. The day was first celebrated in 1999 at the Auditorium, Port of Spain City Hall, with the introduction of an anthology of essays about Philip that was edited by Selwyn Cudjoe.

Sialolithiasis may also develop because of the presence of existing chronic infection of the glands, dehydration (e.g. use of phenothiazines), Sj√∂gren's syndrome and/or increased local levels of calcium, but in many instances the cause is idiopathic (unknown). The condition is usually managed by removing the stone, and several different techniques are available. Rarely, removal of the submandibular gland may become necessary in cases of recurrent stone formation. Sialolithiasis is common, accounting for about 50% of all disease occurring in the major salivary glands and causing symptoms in about 0.45% of the general population. Persons aged 30‚Äì60 and males are more likely to develop sialolithiasis. Classification The term is derived from the Greek words sialon (saliva) and lithos (stone), and the Greek -iasis meaning \\"process\\" or \\"morbid condition\\". A calculus (plural calculi) is a hard, stone-like concretion that forms within an organ or duct inside the body. They are usually made from mineral salts, and other types of calculi include tonsiloliths (tonsil stones) and renal calculi (kidney stones). Sialolithiasis refers to the formation of calculi within a salivary gland. If a calculus forms in the duct that drains the saliva from a salivary gland into the mouth, then saliva will be trapped in the gland. This may cause painful swelling and inflammation of the gland. Inflammation of a salivary gland is termed sialadenitis. Inflammation associated with blockage of the duct is sometimes termed \\"obstructive sialadenitis\\". Because saliva is stimulated to flow more with the thought, sight or smell of food, or with chewing, pain and swelling will often get suddenly worse just before and during a meal (\\"peri-prandial\\"), and then slowly decrease after eating, this is termed meal time syndrome. However, calculi are not the only reasons that a salivary gland may become blocked and give rise to the meal time syndrome. Obstructive salivary gland disease, or obstructive sialadenitis, may also occur due to fibromucinous plugs, duct stenosis, foreign bodies, anatomic variations, or malformations of the duct system leading to a mechanical obstruction associated with stasis of saliva in the duct. Salivary stones may be divided according to which gland they form in. About 85% of stones occur in the submandibular gland, and 5‚Äì10% occur in the parotid gland. In about 0‚Äì5% of cases, the sublingual gland or a minor salivary gland is affected. When minor glands are rarely involved, caliculi are more likely in the minor glands of the buccal mucosa and the maxillary labial mucosa. Submandibular stones are further classified as anterior or posterior in relation to an imaginary transverse line drawn between the mandibular first molar teeth. Stones may be radiopaque, i.e. they will show up on conventional radiographs, or radiolucent, where they not be visible on radiographs (although some of their effects on the gland may still be visible). They may also symptomatic or asymptomatic, according to whether they cause any problems or not. Signs and symptoms Swelling of the submandibular gland as seen from the outside The stone seen in the submandibular duct on the persons right side Signs and symptoms are variable and depend largely upon whether the obstruction of the duct is complete or partial, and how much resultant pressure is created within the gland. The development of infection in the gland also influences the signs and symptoms. * Pain, which is intermittent, and may suddenly get worse before mealtimes, and then slowly get better (partial obstruction). * Swelling of the gland, also usually intermittent, often suddenly appearing or increasing before mealtimes, and then slowly going down (partial obstruction). * Tenderness of the involved gland. * Palpable hard lump, if the stone is located near the end of the duct. If the stone is near the submandibular duct orifice, the lump may be felt under the tongue. * Lack of saliva coming from the duct (total obstruction). * Erythema (redness) of the floor of the mouth (infection). * Pus discharging from the duct (infection). * Cervical lymphadenitis (infection). * Bad breath. Rarely, when stones form in the minor salivary glands, there is usually only slight local swelling in the form of a small nodule and tenderness. Causes The major salivary glands (paired on each side). 1. Parotid gland, 2. Submandibular gland, 3. Sublingual gland. There are thought to be a series of stages that lead to the formation of a calculus (lithogenesis). Initially, factors such as abnormalities in calcium metabolism, dehydration, reduced salivary flow rate, altered acidity (pH) of saliva caused by oropharyngeal infections, and altered solubility of crystalloids, leading to precipitation of mineral salts, are involved. Other sources state that no systemic abnormality of calcium or phosphate metabolism is responsible. The next stage involves the formation of a nidus which is successively layered with organic and inorganic material, eventually forming a calcified mass. In about 15-20% of cases the sialolith will not be sufficiently calcified to appear radiopaque on a radiograph, and will therefore be difficult to detect. Other sources suggest a retrograde theory of lithogenesis, where food debris, bacteria or foreign bodies from the mouth enter the ducts of a salivary gland and are trapped by abnormalities in the sphincter mechanism of the duct opening (the papilla), which are reported in 90% of cases. Fragments of bacteria from salivary calculi were reported to be Streptococci species which are part of the normal oral microbiota and are present in dental plaque. Stone formation occurs most commonly in the submandibular gland for several reasons. The concentration of calcium in saliva produced by the submandibular gland is twice that of the saliva produced by the parotid gland. The submandibular gland saliva is also relatively alkaline and mucous. The submandibular duct (Wharton's duct) is long, meaning that saliva secretions must travel further before being discharged into the mouth. The duct possesses two bends, the first at the posterior border of the mylohyoid muscle and the second near the duct orifice. The flow of saliva from the submandibular gland is often against gravity due to variations in the location of the duct orifice. The orifice itself is smaller than that of the parotid. These factors all promote slowing and stasis of saliva in the submandibular duct, making the formation of an obstruction with subsequent calcification more likely. Salivary calculi sometimes are associated with other salivary diseases, e.g. sialoliths occur in two thirds of cases of chronic sialadenitis, although obstructive sialadenitis is often a consequence of sialolithiasis. Gout may also cause salivary stones, although in this case they are composed of uric acid crystals rather than the normal composition of salivary stones.  Diagnosis  Ultrasound image of sialolithiasis Stone resulting in inflammation and dilation of the duct Diagnosis is usually made by characteristic history and physical examination. Diagnosis can be confirmed by x-ray (80% of salivary gland calculi are visible on x-ray), by sialogram, or by ultrasound.  Treatment  Salivary gland stone and the hole left behind from the operation Some current treatment options are: * Non-invasive: ** For small stones, hydration, moist heat therapy, NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) occasionally, and having the patient take any food or beverage that is bitter and/or sour. Sucking on citrus fruits, such as a lemon or orange, may increase salivation and promote spontaneous expulsion of the stone.(Examples of size: 2‚Äì10 mm) ‚Äì Oral surgery: Self-milking the sialolith (UK) ** Some stones may be massaged out by a specialist. ** Shock wave therapy (Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy). ‚Äì Overview of stones by the National Institutes of Health (US) * Minimally invasive: ** Sialendoscopy * Surgical: ** An ENT or oral/maxillofacial surgeon may cannulate the duct to remove the stone (sialectomy). ** A surgeon may make a small incision near the stone to remove it. ** In some cases when stones continually reoccur the offending salivary duct is removed. * Supporting treatment: ** To prevent infection while the stone is lodged in the duct, antibiotics are sometimes used. Epidemiology The prevalence of salivary stones in the general population is about 1.2% according to post mortem studies, but the prevalence of salivary stones which cause symptoms is about 0.45% in the general population. Sialolithiasis accounts for about 50% of all disease occurring in major salivary glands, and for about 66% of all obstructive salivary gland diseases. Salivary gland stones are twice as common in males as in females. The most common age range in which they occur is between 30 and 60, and they are uncommon in children.

Nolan has covered American politics with a distinctive style that deployed allusions from Shakespeare to baseball. His reporting was innovative. In 1971, he began a year-end tradition of recalling the year's notable obituaries, an ‚ÄúAuld Lang Syne‚Äù feature widely copied by other newspapers and magazines.[1] In 1970, he was the first reporter to use ‚ÄúJoe SixPack‚Äù to describe a working-class American voter.[2] Nolan wrote for the Globe from 1961 to 2001. While working as a White House correspondent, his name appeared on President Richard Nixon's ‚Äúenemies list‚Äù in 1973. [3] He was a general assignment reporter, manning the Globe desk at Boston police headquarters overnight on the ‚Äúlobster shift.‚Äù After covering Boston City Hall and the Massachusetts State House, Nolan was assigned to Washington. In 1969, he was named Washington bureau chief and in 1981 became the Globe's editorial page editor. Born in Boston on March 28, 1940, he was the fifth of five children born to Neil and Martina Nolan. After attending St. Patrick's Grammar School in Roxbury, and Boston College High School, he received a B.A. in history from Boston College. He later received fellowships at Duke, Harvard and Stanford Universities. From 1963 to 1965, Nolan was a private in the U.S. Army. He taught what the military called ‚Äúapplied journalism‚Äù at the Army and Defense Information Schools. While off-duty, he reported for the Globe on a free-lance basis, interviewing Richard Nixon, Robert Kennedy, Barry Goldwater and Nelson Rockefeller. The Globe assigned him to Washington in 1965, where he worked until 1981, covering Congress, the White House, the Supreme Court and other government agencies. He was a member of the Globe investigative team awarded the 1966 Pulitzer Prize for ‚Äúmeritorious and disinterested public service.‚Äù The paper reported conflicting testimony from a Federal judgeship nominee supported by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy. The nominee had served as an aide to the family patriarch, former Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy. Nolan covered presidential campaigns from 1968 to 2004. He interviewed 12 U.S. Presidents, from Harry Truman to Barack Obama, before, during or after their presidencies. Overseas, he interviewed Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin, Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat and politicians in Ireland and the United Kingdom. After he became the Globe's Washington bureau chief in 1969, he won approval from his peers, including John Chancellor and Walter Mears, co-authors of The News Business. On NBC, Chancellor called Nolan ‚Äúone of the very best political reporters in Washington, as savvy and careful as they come.‚Äù [4] Mears, of the Associated Press, wrote that ‚ÄúNolan was a talented, insightful reporter.‚Äù [5] In Boys on the Bus, a 1973 book on campaign journalism, the author, Timothy Crouse, described him this way: Nolan, a witty man in his middle 30s, had the unshaven, slack-jawed, nuts-to-you-too look of a bartender in a sailors‚Äô cafe. He grew up in Dorchester, then a poor section of Boston, and asked his first tough political question at the age of 12. ‚ÄúSister, how do you know Dean Acheson‚Äôs a Communist?,‚Äù he had challenged a reactionary nun in his parochial school, and the reprimand hadn't daunted him from asking wiseacre questions ever since.[6] Nolan seldom described political leaders and their predicaments as solemnly as their staffs and campaign handlers did. In 1972, he told Globe readers about a ‚Äúmore precise‚Äù Massachusetts senator: Interviewing Edward Kennedy used to be like watching an haute-cinemateque French movie. The dialogue was often reduced to soulful stares and meaningful grunts. [7] He compared George Meany the AFL-CIO boss to Shakespeare's King Lear, a cigar stub as his orb and a plumber's wrench as his sceptre....presiding over the final hours of labor's dominance in Democratic Party politics. [8] Reporting from Portland, OR after a volcano eruption, he wrote: Church services were canceled Sunday in reluctant homage to Mount St, Helens. As citizens of these ecology-minded states swept volcanic ash off homes and cars, many of their shrines of scenery were shrouded in Biblical gray. If clergymen needed an Old Testament text, they could have chosen Genesis 18:27 in which Abraham argues with the Lord to spare cities, noting that he is still ‚Äòbut dust and ashes.‚Äô‚Äù [9] In 1973, Nolan was elected to Washington‚Äôs Gridiron Club, devoted to an elite annual white-tie dinner ‚Äúroasting‚Äù politicians. In February 1974, the club voted to continue its policy of refusing membership to women reporters. Nolan resigned, the first Gridiron member to quit since the 19th century. [10] He called the vote ‚Äúan active policy of discrimination,‚Äù as well as ‚Äúunprofessional, unfair and ungentlemanly.‚Äù Protests from female reporters and their political supporters helped change the policy. In November 1974, the Gridiron Club, founded in 1885, voted to admit women for the first time. In Washington, Nolan continued to follow Massachusetts politics. In 1975, Globe editor Thomas Winship assigned him to help cover Boston's mayoral election. Nolan also reported on the 1978 Bay State elections. In 1981, Globe publisher William O. Taylor named him editorial page editor. He continued to report on politics and won several awards. In 1985, he was one of three finalists for the Pulitzer Prize in commentary. In 1991, he was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in editorial writing. The fate of the Boston Red Sox has been one of Nolan's passions and preoccupations for decades. He has been a season ticket holder at Fenway Park since 1982. In 1986, he helped the Globe recruit writers for a special edition for the World Series: Doris Kearns Goodwin, David Halberstam, Stephen King, John Updike and George Will. The articles were collected in the 1991 book, The Red Sox Reader. Its first sentences come is from Nolan's essay on Fenway Park, often cited in exhibitions of baseball art: The ballpark is the star. In the age of Tris Speaker and Babe Ruth, the era of Jimmie Foxx and Ted Williams, through the empty-seats epoch of Don Buddin and Willie Tasby and unto the decades of Carl Yastrzemski and Jim Rice, the ballpark is the star. A crazy-quilt violation of city planning principles, an irregular pile of architecture, a menace to marketing consultants, Fenway Park works. It works as a symbol of New England's pride, as a repository of evergreen hopes, as a tabernacle of lost innocence. It works as a place to watch baseball. [11] The words adorned a book and art display shown in U. S. museums. [12] After new ownership came to Fenway in 2000, Red Sox president Larry Lucchino ordered the first sentences printed on the wall of the team's conference room. In 2003, in his book on the Red Sox, The Teammates, David Halberstam quoted Nolan on life as a Red Sox fan: \\"The Red Sox killed my father, and now they're coming after me.\\" [13] In 2012, the team commissioned Nolan to write a centenary essay marking Fenway Park's 100th birthday. ‚ÄúThe Fenway Century,‚Äù printed in the ballpark's official tour book, concludes that For ten dynamic decades, a prosaic pile of bricks assembled in a reclaimed swamp has housed the passionate poetry of hope. The park defines the intensity of history and tradition in Boston, an old city on the edge of the continent. [14] In 1991, after 10 years of editing the Globe's editorial page Nolan returned to reporting on city, state and national politics. Boston Magazine profiled a reporter whose curiosity, skill and spirit combine to catch the essence of the town....It is hard to be iconoclastic in an age without idols, but Marty Nolan comes close.[15] After a fellowship at Stanford's Hoover Institution, Nolan returned to California in 1995 to become the Globe's West Coast correspondent, writing news stories and columns until 2001, when he retired. He wrote for the San Francisco Chronicle, the San Francisco Examiner, the Los Angeles Times and the California Journal. He became a board member of the Gold Rush Trail Foundation in San Francisco, which aims to replicate Boston's Freedom Trail. The foundation sponsors tours of historic downtown sites in San Francisco for Bay Area schoolchildren.[16] He has contributed chapters to five books and written in The Atlantic, National Review, New Republic, New York, The New York Observer, The Reporter, Village Voice, Washingtonian and Washington Monthly. His writings have also appeared in the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, the Washington Post and the Washington Star. Nolan has three children: David, Ellen and Peter; and two stepchildren, Sarah and Rose Weld. His marriage to Margaret Carroll ended in divorce in 1974. In 1984, he married Elizabeth New Weld. They have six grandchildren and live in San Francisco. ### [1] Nolan, Martin F., (December 31, 1971) ‚ÄúTo the real majority‚Äù . Boston Globe. [2] Nolan, Martin F.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a shortstop for the New York Mets, Montreal Expos, San Francisco Giants, Pittsburgh Pirates, California Angels and New York Yankees from to . At age 17, Foli was the first pick in the Major League Baseball Draft in and went on to be a member of the 1979 World Series champion Pirates. Foli was known as a fiery player who was a reliable fielder but only an average hitter. Foli was a free swinger, especially in when he walked only 14 times, the lowest total ever for 150 or more games played (Ozzie Guill√©n broke Foli's notorious record three years later). His free swinging did not aim for the fences, however, as he averaged less than two home runs per season. His lack of power, combined with a lack of running speed (averaging approximately a stolen base every 20 games) resulted in Foli typically batting either second in the lineup or near the bottom. Although he accumulated few walks, Foli was also one of the most difficult to strike out, posting the league's best strikeout percentage three times and finishing in the top ten five times. Foli compiled a .333 batting average in the 1979 postseason, contributing to Pittsburgh's last World Championship. He was an accomplished bunter, finishing in the league top ten in sacrifice hits eight times including an American League-leading 26 in 1982. Defensively, Foli led league shortstops in fielding percentage in and 1982. He led the National League in double plays twice, in total chances twice, and in putouts once. Foli's defensive low occurred on September 9, 1972, when he committed three errors in one inning, leading to three runs in Montreal's 8‚Äì3 loss. Early years Foli was born in Culver City, California, and attended Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, California. He was a high school star in both baseball and football and was offered a football scholarship by the University of Southern California. When the New York Mets made Foli the first overall draft pick in the 1968 Major League Baseball Draft, he decided to forgo football for the major leagues. Playing career At age seventeen, Foli started out poorly with the Marion Mets of the Appalachian League. The following year, while the Mets were on their way to winning the 1969 World Series, Foli hit over .300 for their high Class A minor league team, the Visalia Mets of the California League. In , Foli posted decent numbers for the Triple-A Tidewater Tides and the Mets called the 19-year-old up to the majors on September 11. At the time, he was the fourth youngest player in the majors, behind C√©sar Cede√±o, Balor Moore and Don Gullett. In his second game, Foli started at third base, picked up two hits and drove in a late run as the Mets defeated the St. Louis Cardinals. The defending champions faded the rest of the way and missed the playoffs. Foli spent all of with the Mets, fighting for playing time at second base and third base. On May 9, he had an RBI triple and a three-run double in the first two innings for his first four-RBI game. It would prove to be his last four-RBI game until . In 97 games, his batting average was .226, with both his on-base percentage and slugging average below .300. =Montreal= Before the season, the Mets packaged Foli with fellow young prospects Ken Singleton and Mike Jorgensen and sent them to the Montreal Expos for star outfielder Rusty Staub. Foli became a mainstay at shortstop in Montreal for the next five seasons. Although Foli, Singleton and Jorgensen played well in Montreal, the Expos never posted a winning record until after Foli was gone and even lost 107 games in . Foli's offensive numbers in five seasons with Montreal were representative of his whole career. He batted between .238 and .264 each season, only once slugging over .300, and only once reaching .300 in on-base percentage. was the only offensive season that stood out for Foli, as he posted career highs with 36 doubles (fifth-highest in the N.L.), six home runs and a .366 slugging average. On April 21, 1976, Foli hit a single, double and triple against the Chicago Cubs before the game was suspended. When the game was resumed the next day, Foli hit a home run to complete the first cycle in Montreal Expos history. In addition, Foli's cycle was the first \\"natural cycle\\" (where the single, double, triple and home run are hit in that sequence) in almost a decade. Foli was popular in Montreal, as evidenced on July 8, 1973, when Houston Astros left fielder Bob Watson slid hard into Foli at second base trying to break up a double play, breaking Foli's jaw. When Watson returned to left field in the next half-inning, the Montreal fans at Jarry Park hurled debris at him. Foli missed the next month of the season. =Journeyman= was the beginning of Foli's time as a major league journeyman. In his final nine seasons, Foli spent seven different stints with six different franchises. His travels began on April 22, 1977 when he was traded to the San Francisco Giants for shortstop Chris Speier. Foli, who was batting .175 at the time of the trade, hit only .228 for the Giants, who finished well out of playoff contention. Foli's Giants highlight was on July 22, when he had the only two-homer game of his career. After the 1977 season, Foli's original team, the Mets, purchased his contract from San Francisco. was a typical season for Foli, who played 113 games and batted .257, while the Mets finished with the worst record in the National League. =Championship in Pittsburgh= After playing just three games for the Mets in , Foli and a minor league player were traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for shortstop Frank Taveras. The trade sent Foli from the worst team in the league to one of the best. Pittsburgh was locked in a season-long battle with Montreal for first place, but took the lead for good in the final days of the season. Foli set career highs in batting average, RBI, runs, hits and on-base percentage. He also struck out once every 38 at bats, a strikeout ratio which has not been bested since. Pittsburgh went on to sweep the 1979 National League Championship Series, with Foli driving in a run in all three games. In the World Series, Foli had a hit in six of the seven games, but the Pirates were trailing three games to one. Facing 23-game winner and 1979 Cy Young Award winner Mike Flanagan, Foli scored the tying run and drove in three insurance runs to keep the Pirates alive in Game 5. Foli then scored a run in Game 6 against Jim Palmer and the Pirates forced a Game 7, which they won the next day to capture the fifth World Championship in team history. Foli posted typical numbers for him in and the strike-shortened season, but the Pirates, suffering from the decline of future Baseball Hall of Fame member Willie Stargell, as well as other intangibles, dropped from World Champions to mediocrity. =Late career= After the 1981 season and shortly after his 31st birthday, Foli was traded again, moving from Pittsburgh to the California Angels in exchange for 22-year-old catcher Brian Harper. Foli was reunited with Gene Mauch, his manager from Montreal. He was slated to be a utility infielder for the Angels, but when Rick Burleson suffered a torn rotator cuff in mid-April, Foli spent the season as the starting shortstop. A mid-September winning streak propelled the Angels into first place and into the 1982 American League playoffs, but they lost to the Milwaukee Brewers three games to two, as Foli managed only two hits and one RBI. Foli played very little in the last third of the next season, finishing with only 88 games. Towards the end of the season, Foli was suspended by the team for not being in uniform after a September 11 rain delay. The Angels traded Foli to the New York Yankees for pitcher Curt Kaufman after the season. In 61 games, Foli played all four infield positions for the Yankees, who traded him to his old stomping grounds in Pittsburgh after the season in a trade which brought 20-year-old Jay Buhner to the Yankees. Foli batted just .189 in 19 games with the Pirates in , before Pittsburgh released him on June 17. Foli, then aged 34, was signed by the Single-A Miami Marlins, but retired after playing just one game with the team. Post-playing career After retirement as a player, Tim Foli turned to coaching. He was the third base coach and infield coach for the Texas Rangers in and . During the off-season in early 1987, Foli was the manager of the Caguas, Puerto Rico, team in the Caribbean World Series when his fiery personality made news. After losing the first two games to the Dominican Republic, Caguas general manager F√©lix Mill√°n fired Foli, claiming he had been disrespectful. Caguas recovered to win the championship. On November 19, 1991, Foli was named the first base coach and infield coach for the Milwaukee Brewers, rejoining fellow coach Duffy Dyer, who had been a teammate of his while with the Mets. On September 29, 1995, Foli and Dyer were both let go by the Brewers. Foli spent as a coach with the Kansas City Royals under manager Bob Boone, who was Foli's teammate with the California Angels. He then managed the Rookie-level Kingsport Mets of the Appalachian League in and spent to with the New York Mets organization as an infield and base running coordinator. On September 16, 2000, Foli began three tumultuous seasons as a coach with the Cincinnati Reds, reunited with former Angels catcher Bob Boone, who was the Reds' manager. Just a few months into his coaching job, Foli became embroiled in a physical confrontation with fellow coach, Ron Oester, after a game. Foli required stitches. The turmoil in Cincinnati did not soon end, as Oester was let go after the season, the team's superstar, Ken Griffey, Jr. was injured in four consecutive seasons, coach Ken Griffey, Sr. resigned on bad terms, and the Reds posted three consecutive losing seasons. As a result, Foli, Boone, the general manager and another coach were all fired on July 28, 2003. After taking 2004 off, Foli spent two seasons as manager of the Washington Nationals' Triple-A team, the New Orleans Zephyrs of the Pacific Coast League; the team had a record of 64‚Äì76 (14th place) in 2005, and 72‚Äì71 (9th place) in 2006. In 2007, he served as minor league field coordinator for the Nationals. He then managed Washington's Triple-A teams in the International League for two seasons; in 2008 the Columbus Clippers (69‚Äì73, tied for 7th place) and in 2009 the Syracuse Chiefs (76‚Äì68, 5th place). Personal life Foli's son, Daniel Foli, was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 31st round of the 2001 MLB draft. He pitched in the minor leagues from 2001 through 2009, for teams affiliated with the Cubs (2001‚Äì2003), Mets (2004‚Äì2005), Nationals (2006‚Äì2007), and Astros (2007). He spent his final two seasons in the independent Atlantic League with the York Revolution (2008‚Äì2009). In nine seasons, he compiled a record of 35‚Äì50 with a 5.07 ERA and 1.587 WHIP.

RGPs also produce certain lineages of glia, including astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Their cell bodies (somata) reside in the embryonic ventricular zone, which lies next to the developing ventricular system. During development, newborn neurons use radial glia as scaffolds, traveling along the radial glial fibers in order to reach their final destinations. Despite the various possible fates of the radial glial population, it has been demonstrated through clonal analysis that most radial glia have restricted, unipotent or multipotent, fates. Radial glia can be found during the neurogenic phase in all vertebrates (studied to date). The term \\"radial glia\\" refers to the morphological characteristics of these cells that were first observed: namely, their radial processes and their similarity to astrocytes, another member of the glial cell family.  Structure  =M√ºller glia= M√ºller glia are radial glial cells that are present in the developing, as well as the adult, retina. As in the cortex, M√ºller glia have long processes that span the entire width of the retina, from the basal cell layer to the apical layer. However, unlike cortical radial glia, M√ºller glia do not appear in the retina until after the first rounds of neurogenesis have occurred. Studies suggest that M√ºller glia can dedifferentiate into readily dividing neural progenitors in response to injury. Slcla3 in Bergmann Glia The characteristics that truly set M√ºller glia apart from radial glia in other areas of the brain, is their possession of optical properties. The majority of the retina is actually largely light scattering, suggesting that M√ºller glia serve as the main fiber responsible for the relay of light to the photoreceptors in the rear of the retina. Properties that help M√ºller glia achieve this function include a limited number mitochondria (which are very light scattering), as well as a specialized arrangement of internal protein filaments. M√ºller glia are the predominant type of macroglia in the retina, so they take on many of the supportive functions that astrocytes and oligodendrocytes usually handle in the rest of the central nervous system. =Bergmann glia= Bergmann glia (also known as radial epithelial cells, Golgi epithelial cells, or radial astrocytes) are unipolar astrocytes derived from radial glia that are intimately associated with Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Since bergmann glia appear to persist in the cerebellum, and perform many of the roles characteristic of astrocytes, they have also been called \\"specialized astrocytes.\\" Bergmann glia have multiple radial processes that extend across the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex and terminate at the pial surface as a bulbous endfoot. Bergmann glial cells assist with the migration of granule cells, guiding the small neurons from the external granular layer down to the internal granular layer along their extensive radial processes. Besides their role in early development of the cerebellum, Bergmann glia are also required for synaptic pruning. Following Purkinje cell death induced by CNS injury, Bergmann glia undergo extensive proliferative changes so as to replace lost or damaged tissue in a process known as gliosis. Development Radial glial cells originate from the transformation of neuroepithelial cells that form the neural plate during neurogenesis in early embryonic development. This process is mediated through the down-regulation of epithelium-related protein expression (such as tight junctions) and an up- regulation of glial-specific features such as glycogen granules, the astrocyte glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST), the intermediate filament vimentin, and, in some instances, including humans, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). After this transition, radial glia retain many of the original characteristics of neuroepithelial cells including: their apical-basal polarity, their position along the lateral ventricles of the developing cortex, and the phasic migration of their nuclei depending on their location with the cell cycle (termed ‚Äúinterkinetic nuclear migration‚Äù).  Function  =Progenitors= Interneuron-radial glial interactions in the developing cerebral cortex Radial glia are now recognized as key progenitor cells in the developing nervous system. During the late stages of neurogenesis, radial glial cells divide asymmetrically in the ventricular zone, generating a new radial glial cell, as well as a postmitotic neuron or an intermediate progenitor (IPC) daughter cell. Intermediate progenitor cells then divide symmetrically in the subventricular zone to generate neurons. Local environmental cues such as Notch and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling, developmental period, and differing abilities of radial glia to respond to environmental cues have all been shown to influence the type of radial glia and radial glia-derived daughter cells that will be produced. FGF and Notch signaling regulate the proliferation of radial glia and the rate of neurogenesis, which affects the surface area expansion of the cerebral cortex and its ability to form surface convolutions known as gyri (see gyrification). Radial glial cells show high levels of calcium transient activity, which is transmitted between RGCs in the ventricular zone and along the radial fibers bidirectionally to/from the cortical plate. The calcium activity is thought to promote RGC proliferation and could be involved in radial communication before synapses are present in the brain. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that cues from the external sensory environment can also influence the proliferation and neural differentiation of radial glia. At the conclusion of cortical development, most radial glia lose their attachment to the ventricles, and migrate towards the surface of the cortex, where, in mammals, most will become astrocytes during the process of gliogenesis. While it has been suggested that radial glia most likely give rise to oligodendrocytes, through the generation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), and OPCs can be generated from radial glial cells in vitro, more evidence is yet needed to conclude whether this process also occurs in the developing brain. Recently, radial glia that exclusively generate upper-layer cortical neurons have also been discovered. Since upper cortical layers have expanded greatly in recent evolution, and are associated with higher-level information processing and thinking, radial glia have been implicated as important mediators of brain evolution. =Migration Pattern= The best characterized and first widely accepted function of radial glia is their role as scaffolds for neuronal migration in the cerebral and cerebellar cortexes. This role can be easily visualized using the electron microscope or high-resolution time- lapse microscopy, through which neurons can be seen tightly wrapped around radial glia as they travel upwards through the cortex. Additional evidence suggests that many neurons may move between neighboring radial glial fibers during migration. While excitatory neuronal migration is largely radial, inhibitory, GABAergic neurons have been shown to undergo tangential migration. Tangentially migrating neurons also appear to initiate contact with radial glial fibers in the developing cortex of ferrets, implicating radial glial cells in both of these forms of migration. As radial glia seem to differentiate late in spinal cord development, near the onset of gliogenesis, it is unclear whether they are involved in spinal cord neurogenesis or migration. =Compartmentalization= Radial glia have also been implicated in forming boundaries between different axonal tracts and white matter areas of the brain. Clinical significance As radial glia serve as the primary neural and glial progenitors in the brain, as well as being crucial for proper neuronal migration, defects in radial glial function can have profound effects in the development of the nervous system. Mutations in either Lis1 or Nde1, essential proteins for radial glial differentiation and stabilization, cause the associated neurodevelopmental diseases Lissencephaly and microlissencephaly (which literally translate to ‚Äúsmooth brain‚Äù). Patients with these diseases are characterized by a lack of cortical folds (sulci and gyri) and reduced brain volume. Extreme cases of Lissencephaly cause death a few months after birth, while patients with milder forms may experience mental retardation, difficulty balancing, motor and speech deficits, and epilepsy. Death of neural progenitor cells has recently been linked the mosquito-borne virus, Zika. Epidemiological evidence indicates infection of the embryo within the first two trimesters of pregnancy has potential to cause fetal birth defects and microcephaly, possibly due to the death of progenitor cells. Further, mutations in microcephaly associated genes which encode proteins such as WDR62 can lead to radial glial depletion during brain development which ultimately leads to a smaller brain size and mental disabilities. History Camillo Golgi, using his silver staining technique (later deemed the Golgi method), first described radially oriented cells spanning from the central canal to the outer surface of the embryonic chick spinal cord, in 1885. Using the Golgi method, Giuseppe Magini then studied the mammalian fetal cerebral cortex in 1888, confirming the similar presence of elongated radial cells in the cortex (also described by K√∂lliker just before him), and observing ‚Äúvarious varicosities or swellings‚Äù on the radial fibers. Intrigued, Magini also observed that the size and number of these varicosities increased later in development, and were absent in the adult nervous system. Based on these findings, Magini then hypothesized that these varicosities could be developing neurons. Using a combination Golgi and hematoxylin staining method, Magini was able to identify these varicosities as cells, some of which were very closely associated with the radial fibers. Additional early works that were important in elucidating the identity and function of radial glia, were completed by Ram√≥n y Cajal, who first suggested that the radial cells were a type of glia through their similarities to astrocytes; and Wilhelm His, who also proposed the idea that growing axons may use radial cells for orientation and guidance during development. Despite the initial period of interest in radial glia, little additional information was learned about these cells until the electron microscope and immunohistochemistry became available some 60 years later.

An ukiyo-e print by Hokusai depicting Okiku is a Japanese ghost story (kaidan) of broken trust and broken promises, leading to a dismal fate. Alternatively referred to as the tradition, all versions of the tale revolve around a servant, who dies unjustly and returns to haunt the living. Some versions take place in or , others in the area in Edo. History The story of the death of Okiku () first appeared as a bunraku play called Banch≈ç Sarayashiki in July 1741 at the Toyotakeza theater. The familiar ghost legend had been adapted into a ningy≈ç j≈çruri production by Asada Iccho and Tamenaga Tarobei I. Like many successful bunraku shows, a kabuki version followed and in September 1824, Banch≈ç Sarayashiki was staged at the Naka no Shibai theater starring Otani Tomoemon II and Arashi Koroku IV in the roles of Aoyama Daihachi and Okiku. A one-act kabuki version was created in 1850 by Segawa Joko III, under the title Minoriyoshi Kogane no Kikuzuki, which debuted at the Nakamura-za theater and starred Ichikawa Danj≈´r≈ç VIII and Ichikawa Kodanji IV in the roles of Tetsuzan and Okiku. This one-act adaptation was not popular, and quickly folded, until it was revived in June 1971 at the Shinbashi Enbuj≈ç theater, starring the popular combination of Kataoka Takao and Bando Tamasabur≈ç V in the roles of Tetsuzan and Okiku. The most familiar and popular adaptation of Banch≈ç Sarayashiki, written by Okamoto Kido, debuted in February 1916 at the Hong≈ç-za theater, starring Ichikawa Sadanji II and Ichikawa Sh≈çch≈ç II in the roles of Lord Harima and Okiku. It was a modern version of the classic ghost story in which the horror tale was replaced by a deep psychological study of the two characters' motivations. Plot summary =Folk version= Once there was a beautiful servant named Okiku. She worked for the samurai Aoyama Tessan. Okiku often refused his amorous advances, so he tricked her into believing that she had carelessly lost one of the family's ten precious Delft plates. Such a crime would normally result in her death. In a frenzy, she counted and recounted the nine plates many times. However, she could not find the tenth and went to Aoyama in guilty tears. The samurai offered to overlook the matter if she finally became his lover, but again she refused. Enraged, Aoyama threw her down a well to her death. It is said that Okiku became a vengeful spirit (Onry≈ç) who tormented her murderer by counting to nine and then making a terrible shriek to represent the missing tenth plate ‚Äì or perhaps she had tormented herself and was still trying to find the tenth plate but cried out in agony when she never could. In some versions of the story, this torment continued until an exorcist or neighbor shouted \\"ten\\" in a loud voice at the end of her count. Her ghost, finally relieved that someone had found the plate for her, haunted the samurai no more. =Ningy≈ç J≈çruri version= Hosokawa Katsumoto, the lord of Himeji Castle, has fallen seriously ill. Katsumoto's heir, Tomonosuke, plans to give a set of 10 precious plates to the sh≈çgun to ensure his succession. However, chief retainer Asayama Tetsuzan plots to take over. Tomonosuke's retainer, Funase Sampei Taketsune is engaged to marry a lady in waiting, Okiku. Tetsuzan plans to force Okiku to help him murder Tomonosuke. Tetsuzan, through the help of a spy, steals one of the 10 plates and summons Okiku to bring the box containing the plates to his chamber. There, he attempts to seduce Okiku. She refuses due to her love for Taketsune. Rejected, Tetsuzan then has Okiku count the plates to find only nine. He blames her for the theft and offers to lie for her if she will be his mistress. Okiku again refuses and Tetsuzan has her beaten with a wooden sword. Tetsuzan then has her suspended over a well and, erotically enjoying her torture, has her lowered into the well several times, beating her himself when she is raised. He demands that she become his lover and assist in the murder of Tomonosuke. She refuses again, whereupon Tetsuzan strikes her with his sword, sending her body into the well. While wiping clean his sword, the sound of a voice counting plate comes from the well. Tetsuzan realizes that it is the ghost of Okiku but is entirely unmoved. The play ends with the ghost of Okiku rising from the well, Tetsuzan staring at her contemptuously. =Okamoto Kido version= In 1655, in Edo, a vassal of the Shogun Aoyama Harima has fallen in love with a young servant girl Okiku. Aoyama has promised to marry her but has recently received an auspicious marriage proposal from an Aunt. Aoyama promises Okiku that he will honor their love, and refuse the proposal. Okiku doubts and tests him by breaking one of the 10 heirloom plates that are the treasure of the Aoyama household. The traditional punishment for breaking one of the plates is death, which is demanded by Aoyama's family. At first, Aoyama is convinced that Okiku broke the plate by accident and pardons her, but when Okiku reveals that she broke the plate as a love-test, Aoyama is enraged and kills her. He then throws her body down a well. From then after, Okiku's y≈´rei (ghost) is seen to enter the house and count the plates, one through nine. Encountering her in the garden, Aoyama sees that her ghostly face is not one of vengeance, but beauty and calm. Taking strength from this, he commits seppuku and joins her in death. Okamoto's version is notable for being a much more romantic adaptation of the story, similar to the kabuki version of Botan D≈çr≈ç. This was an influence of the Meiji Restoration, which brought Western plays to Japan for the first time. Western plays were much more noticeable for romantic elements, and this was adapted into a style of theater known as Shin Kabuki. Shin Kabuki was ultimately an unsuccessful merger of East and West, although Okamoto's Banch≈ç Sarayashiki remains as one of the few classics. =Variations= In some versions of the tale, Okiku is a maid who incurs her mistress' jealousy. Her mistress breaks one of the dishes that Okiku is responsible for and Okiku commits suicide. Similar to the other versions, her ghost is heard counting the plates, but her mistress goes insane and dies. Okiku and ukiyo-e Like many kabuki plays, Okiku was a popular subject matter for ukiyo-e artists. In 1830, Katsushika Hokusai included her as one of the kaidan in his One Hundred Tales (Hyaku monogatari) series. Ekin, a somewhat notorious artist who had troubles with the law, painted a by≈çbu- ePictures on paper folding screens. of Okiku being accused by Tetsuzan Aoyama and his brother Chuta. Most notably, she appeared as one of the New Forms of Thirty-Six Ghosts by Tsukioka Yoshitoshi. His portrayal of Okiku is unusually sympathetic, particularly as ghosts were viewed as fearsome apparitions by nineteenth-century Japanese, reflecting a general trend in his later work. Influences on Japanese culture Illustration of the \\"Okiku insect\\" from Ehon Hyaku Monogatari. In 1795, old wells in Japan suffered from an infestation of byasa larvae that became known as the . This larva, covered with thin threads making it look as though it had been bound, was widely believed to be a reincarnation of Okiku. The Ningyo Joruri version is set in Himeji Castle, a popular tourist attraction at the castle is Okiku-Ido, or Okiku's Well. Traditionally, this is where the hapless maid's body was thrown after being killed by Tetsuzan. Although the castle is closed at night, it is said that her ghost still rises nightly from the well, and counts to nine before shrieking and returning. Adaptations Manga artist Rumiko Takahashi included a parody of the legend of Okiku in her romantic comedy Maison Ikkoku. As part of an Obon event, the residents of Ikkoku-kan take part in a summer festival; Kyoko dresses up as Okiku and is supposed to hide in a shallow well.\\"Ido no naka\\" in Takahashi Rumiko, 1984, Mezon Ikkoku, vol. 6, Tokyo: Shogakukan, pp. 165‚Äì184. The noted fiction writer Y≈´ko Tsushima refers to the legend in her novel , where the main character, engaged in a romantic relationship coloured by jealousy, helps her friend clean insects from her flat. Her friend's daughter takes one to show to her father, but the insect disappears and her father tells her that it was probably a Chrysanthemum beetle that turned into a white butterfly. He then tells her of Okiku, a maid who put a needle on her master's (her lover) plate and was murdered as punishment, and whose vengeance lives on in the form of the beetle. Another adaptation was made in 2002, in Story 4 of the Japanese television drama Kaidan Hyaku Shosetsu. Kaidan Hyaku Shosetsu [ÊÄ™Ë´áÁôæÁâ©Ë™û] :: jdorama.com Okiku and her legend also appear in Rin Chupeco's 2014 horror novel The Girl From the Well and its sequel, The Suffering.

Reification involves the representation of factual assertions that are referred to by other assertions, which might then be manipulated in some way; e.g., comparing logical assertions from different witnesses in order to determine their credibility. The message \\"John is six feet tall\\" is an assertion involving truth that commits the speaker to its factuality, whereas the reified statement \\"Mary reports that John is six feet tall\\" defers such commitment to Mary. In this way, the statements can be incompatible without creating contradictions in reasoning. For example, the statements \\"John is six feet tall\\" and \\"John is five feet tall\\" are mutually exclusive (and thus incompatible), but the statements \\"Mary reports that John is six feet tall\\" and \\"Paul reports that John is five feet tall\\" are not incompatible, as they are both governed by a conclusive rationale that either Mary or Paul is (or both are), in fact, incorrect. In linguistics, reporting, telling, and saying are recognized as verbal processes that project a wording (or locution). If a person says that \\"Paul told x\\" and \\"Mary told y\\", this person stated only that the telling took place. In this case, the person who made these two statements did not represent a person inconsistently. In addition, if two people are talking to each other, let's say Paul and Mary, and Paul tells Mary \\"John is five feet tall\\" and Mary rejects Paul's statement by saying \\"No, he is actually six feet tall\\", the socially constructed model of John does not become inconsistent. The reason for that is that statements are to be understood as an attempt to convince the addressee of something (Austin's How to do things with words), alternatively as a request to add some attribute to the model of Paul. The response to a statement can be an acknowledgement, in which case the model is changed, or it can be a statement rejection, in which case the model does not get changed. Finally, the example above for which John is said to be \\"five feet tall\\" or \\"six feet tall\\" is only incompatible because John can only be a single number of feet tall. If the attribute were a possession as in \\"he has a dog\\" or \\"he also has a cat\\", a model inconsistency would not happen. In other words, the issue of model inconsistency has to do with our model of the domain element (John) and not with the ascription of different range elements (measurements such as \\"five feet tall\\" or \\"six feet tall\\") nor with statements.

The High Court extended the defence of qualified privilege to be compatible with the freedom of political communication. The High Court found that the ABC had defamed Lange. Background The plaintiff, David Lange, who was the New Zealand Prime Minister, was the subject of a report on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation current affairs program Four Corners. He brought defamation proceedings in respect of that broadcast. In April 1990 the defendant broadcast on its Four Corners program a report which had been broadcast the previous night in New Zealand on Television New Zealand's Frontline program. The program alleged that the New Zealand Labour Party, then in government, had come to be improperly under the influence of large business interests, as a result of those interests making large donations to New Zealand Labour's 1987 election campaign funds. The plaintiff was the Prime Minister of New Zealand at the relevant time referred to in the report. He contends, among other things, that the report conveyed the false and defamatory imputations that, as Prime Minister, he: a. had permitted big business donors to dictate government policy, and had allowed public assets to be sold to some of those donors in repayment for their donations; b. had abused, and was unfit to hold, public office in that he had permitted a debt incurred by his party in the election campaign to be written off by awarding a government contract to the creditor; c. was corrupt and deceitful in that he had accepted gifts of shares and profits on share trading from a leading business figure, and had permitted that figure to set up a share trading account on his behalf, all in return for permitting the business figure to influence government policy in favour of business interests. [1997] High Court Review 13. Decision =Implied freedom of political communication= In a unanimous judgment, the Court sought to clarify the interaction between the implied freedom of political communication and defamation laws, and the applicability of the implied freedom to state as well as commonwealth matters. The implied freedom was held to be an ongoing freedom, and not limited to election periods. The freedom's purpose is grounded on the functioning of democratic and responsible government, requiring freedom of communication between the voters and their representatives. The continuous nature of the freedom is justified by the concept of representative government, requiring the freedom to operate continuously, and not merely during election periods. The implied freedom was held to be a negative right, not a grant of a free- standing positive right, and operated chiefly as a restraint on executive and legislative power to the extent that such power would burden the implied freedom. The Court thus overturned its earlier decisions in Theophanous v Herald & Weekly Times Ltd. and Stephens v West Australian Newspapers.. The Court modified the requirements of the common law defence of qualified privilege because the existing defence did not adequately accommodate the requirements of the implied freedom of political communication. The Court suggested that qualified privilege ordinarily deals with situations where there is reciprocity between the duty of the publisher to inform and the interest of readers in receiving that information. In the context of a publication about governmental or political affairs, the Court held that all voters have an interest in receiving information about such matters. There is hence a duty on publishers to publish that information. In such situations, the Court held that the reasonableness of the publisher in all the circumstances becomes a pertinent issue. Where it was reasonable for the publisher to publish potentially defamatory information, that is a defence to defamation proceedings. The Court developed a two-part test: # Does the law effectively burden freedom of communication about government or political matters? The scope of political communication was narrowed from Theophanous, to mean matters that could affect their choice at elections, or the affairs of federal ministers and the executive. # If the law does burden that freedom, is the law reasonably appropriate and adapted to serve a legitimate end which is compatible with the maintenance of representative and responsible government? The objectives of the government in making the law are considered; in this case, the Court accepted that protecting the reputation of individuals was appropriate and adapted. Factors which may inform the requirement of reasonableness include: *whether the publisher had reasonable grounds to believe the defamatory matter to be true *did the publisher take reasonable steps to verify the accuracy of the material? *did the publisher not believe the imputation to be untrue? *did the publisher seek a response from the person affected by the publication, or was it unnecessary or impracticable to do so? The defendants also claimed qualified privilege under the Defamation Act 1974 (NSW), which the court held to be appropriate and adapted. In 2015 the High Court in McCloy v NSW revised the test of whether the law in question impinges on the implied freedom of political communication through a three- step test:. See also . #Does the law effectively burden the freedom of communication about government or political matters either in its terms, operation of effect? #Is the purpose of the law and the means adopted to achieve that purpose compatible with the maintenance of constitutionally prescribed system of representative government? #Is the law reasonably appropriate and adapted to advance that legitimate object? This is analysed through three stages. First, the suitability requirement requires that the law have a rational connection to the purpose of the provision. Secondly, the necessity requirement considers whether there are any obvious and compelling alternative, reasonably practicable means of achieving the relevant purpose in a way which has a less restrictive effect on the freedom. Finally, the adequacy on balance requirement considers whether there is a balance between the 'positive effect of realising the law's proper purpose with the negative effect of the limits on constitutional rights or freedom'. =Reconsideration of Theophanous and Stephens= The Court was prepared to reconsider the reasoning of the decisions in Theophanous and Stephens, because neither of the cases contained strong constitutional law principles; In both earlier cases, Deane J agreed with Mason CJ, Toohey and Gaudron JJ on the outcome, but he differed in the view of the scope of the implied freedom. =Common law and the Constitution= The Court held that the \\"common law must conform with the Constitution\\", and the common law cannot run \\"counter to constitutional imperatives\\". The common law and constitutional law questions differ: the common law question defines the scope of the right of the defamed, while the constitutional law question specifies the area that cannot be infringed by a Commonwealth or State/Territory law. =External matters= Although this case does not entirely clarify the issue, discussion of matters at other levels of government (such as at State or Territory level) may impact federal matters, so the fact that Lange was from New Zealand does not preclude the matter.

Neon first appeared in a story penciled and inked by Lou Fine in Hit Comics #1 and was featured on the cover. His stories ran in issues 1‚Äì17. Like many characters owned by that company, he was later bought by DC Comics after Quality ceased operations. Fictional character biography Tom Corbet is a member of the Foreign Legion. While pursuing an enemy across the desert, his entire unit dies of dehydration. Surely he would have suffered the same fate if he hadn't found a magical oasis at the last second. Corbet drinks the glowing water and is transformed into Neon the Unknown, with the ability to fly and shoot energy from his hands. According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, \\"he uses his power to kill an attacking tiger, stop a would-be world conqueror, and go on to fight crime and evil and the Germans, as well as Darmus the Wizard, the Tibetan Four Lamas, a \\"Batzi\\" scientist who drops \\"insanity spores\\" on the United States, and the scientist Fritz Cardiff and his invisibility ray\\". On December 7, 1941, Neon is recruited by Uncle Sam to be a member of the Freedom Fighters, along with several other Quality Comics heroes, and defend Pearl Harbor from the Japanese attack. He, Uncle Sam, Miss America, Hourman, Invisible Hood, Magno, and Red Torpedo fight valiantly. However, all but Uncle Sam is seemingly killed. As of 2008 Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters mini- series, Neon is revealed to be alive and has been living at his magical oasis (Magno is the only superhero who appears to have actually died in the defense of Pearl Harbor). = The new Neon = Called upon during a major crisis hitting the reformed Freedom Fighters, Tom Corbet is confronted by Langford Terrill, the former Ray.http://goldenageheroes.blogspot.com/2008/08/secret- origin-of-neon-unknown.html Now warped into a more powerful glowing form but more detached from humanity, Corbet refuses his help but lets Terrill drink from his magical oasis. Adding his light-based powers to Neon's energies, Langford Terrill is now empowered as the new Neon the Unknown. =DC Rebirth= In DC Rebirth's The Unexpected, Neon the Unknown (real name Colin Nomi) is now a famous painter and a bisexual man, appearing first in Supergirl #20. Desiring more inspiration for his work, Colin performed a ritual to evoke the Fires of Creation, which resulted in him acquiring great powers to create or manipulate matter but in exchange for his vision and the lives of his friends. Colin set out on a journey of redemption as Neon the Unknown, and eventually he met up with two others on paths of redemption calling themselves Viking Judge and the Ascendant. The three of them formed The Unexpected, defenders of the Multiverse.The Unexpected #2 (2018) His ability to change things - although not destroy them - is seemingly limitless, as, in the end, he even transforms the terrifying hypervampire Mandrakk the Dark Monitor into a predator who no longer feeds on life, but death, forcing him into exile in the Dark Multiverse.The Unexpected #8 (2018) Reception In The Steranko History of Comics, historian Jim Steranko has harsh words for the strip: \\"The art for Neon... was extremely competent but the concepts and scripts were uninspired and threadbare\\".

It is in the genus Glyptemys, a genus which contains only one other species of turtle: the bog turtle (Glyptemys muhlenbergii ). The wood turtle reaches a straight carapace length of , its defining characteristic being the pyramidal shape of the scutes on its upper shell. Morphologically, it is similar to the bog turtle, spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata), and Blanding's turtle (Emydoidea blandingii). The wood turtle exists in a broad geographic range extending from Nova Scotia in the north (and east) to Minnesota in the west and Virginia in the south. In the past, it was forced south by encroaching glaciers: skeletal remains have been found as far south as Georgia. It spends a great deal of time in or near the water of wide rivers, preferring shallow, clear streams with compacted and sandy bottoms. The wood turtle can also be found in forests and grasslands, but will rarely be seen more than several hundred meters from flowing water. It is diurnal and is not overtly territorial. It spends the winter in hibernation and the hottest parts of the summer in estivation. The wood turtle is omnivorous and is capable of eating on land or in water. On an average day, a wood turtle will move , a decidedly long distance for a turtle. Many other animals that live in its habitat pose a threat to it. Raccoons are over-abundant in many places and are a direct threat to all life stages of this species. Inadvertently, humans cause many deaths through habitat destruction, road traffic, farming accidents, and illegal collection. When unharmed, it can live for up to 40 years in the wild and 58 years in captivity. The wood turtle belongs to the family Emydidae. The specific name, insculpta, refers to the rough, sculptured surface of the carapace. This turtle species inhabits aquatic and terrestrial areas of North America, primarily the northeast of the United States and parts of Canada. Wood turtle populations are under high conservation concerns due to human interference of natural habitats. Habitat destruction and fragmentation can negatively impact the ability for wood turtles to search for suitable mates and build high quality nests. Taxonomy Formerly in the genus Clemmys, the wood turtle is now a member of the genus Glyptemys, a classification that the wood turtle shares with only the bog turtle. It and the bog turtle have a similar genetic makeup, which is marginally different from that of the spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata), the only current member of the genus Clemmys. The wood turtle has undergone extensive scientific name changes by various scientists over the course of its history. Today, there are several prominent common names for the wood turtle, including sculptured tortoise, red-legged tortoise, and redleg. Although no subspecies are recognized, there are morphological differences in wood turtles between areas. Individuals found in the west of its geographic range (areas like the Great Lakes and the Midwest United States) have a paler complexion on the inside of the legs and underside of the neck than ones found in the east (places including the Appalachian Mountains, New York, and Pennsylvania). Genetic analysis has also revealed that southern populations have less genetic diversity than the northern; however, both exhibit a fair amount of diversity considering the decline in numbers that have occurred during previous ice ages. Description alt=Plastron of an adult male. Wood turtles grow to between in straight carapace length, and reach a maximum of . They have a rough carapace that is a tan, grayish brown or brown color, with a central ridge (called a keel) made up of a pyramidal pattern of ridges and grooves. Older turtles typically display an abraded or worn carapace. Fully grown, they weigh . The wood turtle's karyotype consists of 50 chromosomes. The larger scutes display a pattern of black or yellow lines. The wood turtle's plastron (ventral shell) is yellowish in color and has dark patches. The posterior margin of the plastron terminates in a V-shaped notch. Although sometimes speckled with yellowish spots, the upper surface of the head is often a dark gray to solid black. The ventral surfaces of the neck, chin, and legs are orange to red with faint yellow stripes along the lower jaw of some individuals. Seasonal variation in color vibrancy have been known to occur. At maturity, males, who reach a maximum straight carapace length of , are larger than females, who have been recorded to reach . Males also have larger claws, a larger head, a concave plastron, a more dome-like carapace, and longer tails than females. The plastron of females and juveniles is flat while in males it gains concavity with age. The posterior marginal scutes of females and juveniles (of either sex) radiate outward more than in mature males. The coloration on the neck, chin, and inner legs is more vibrant in males than in females who display a pale yellowish color in those areas. Hatchlings range in size from in length (straight carapace measurement). The plastrons of hatchlings are dull gray to brown. Their tail usually equals the length of the carapace and their neck and legs lack the bright coloration found in adults. Hatchling's carapaces also are as wide as they are long and lack the pyramidal pattern found in older turtles. The eastern box turtle (Terrapene c. carolina) and Blanding's turtle are similar in appearance to the wood turtle and all three live in overlapping habitats. However, unlike the wood turtle, both Blanding's turtle and the eastern box turtle have hinged plastrons that allow them to completely close their shells. The diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) has a shell closely resembling the wood turtle's; however its skin is gray in color, and it inhabits coastal brackish and saltwater marshes. The bog turtle and spotted turtle are also similar, but neither of these has the specific sculptured surface found on the carapaces of the wood turtle. Distribution and habitat alt=Map of the eastern United States and eastern Canada, read coloring marks the wood turtles inhabitance. The wood turtle is found in most New England states, Nova Scotia, west to Michigan, northern Indiana and Minnesota, and south to Virginia. Overall, the distribution is disjunct with populations often being small and isolated. Roughly 30% of its total population is in Canada. It prefers slow-moving streams containing a sandy bottom and heavily vegetated banks. The soft bottoms and muddy shores of these streams are ideal for overwintering. Also, the areas bordering the streams (usually with open canopies ) are used for nesting. Spring to summer is spent in open areas including forests, fields, bogs, wet meadows, and beaver ponds. The rest of the year is spent in the aforementioned waterways. The densities of wood turtle populations have also been studied. In the northern portion of its range (Quebec and other areas of Canada), populations are fairly dilute, containing an average of 0.44 individuals per , while in the south, over the same area, the densities varied largely from 6 to 90 turtles. In addition to this, it has been found that colonies often have more females than males. In the western portion of its range, wood turtles are more aquatic. In the east, wood turtles are decidedly more terrestrial, especially during the summer. During this time, they can be found in wooded areas with wide open canopies. However, even here, they are never far from water and will enter it every few days. =Evolutionary history= In the past, wood turtle populations were forced south by extending glaciers. Remains from the Rancholabrean period (300,000 to 11,000 years ago) have been found in states such as Georgia and Tennessee, both of which are well south of their current range. After the receding of the ice, wood turtle colonies were able to re- inhabit their customary northern range (areas like New Brunswick and Nova Scotia). Nesting behavior This species is oviparous, meaning these turtles produce offspring by laying eggs only and do not provide parental care outside of nest-building. Thus, the location and quality of nesting sites determine the offspring survival and fitness, so females invest significant time and energy into nest site selection and construction. Females select nest sites based on soil temperature (preferring warmer temperature nest sites), but not soil composition. Average nest size is four inches wide and three inches deep. Also, females build nests in elevated areas in order to avoid flooding and predation. After laying eggs, female wood turtles will cover the nest with leaves or dirt in order to hide the unhatched eggs from predators, and then the female leaves the nest location until the next mating season. Nesting sites can be used by the same female for multiple years. Because nest building occurs along rivers, females tend to spend more time along river areas, compared to male turtles. Ecology and behavior alt=This turtle is sitting on an elevated log that is lying horizontal. It is facing the right of the screen. During the spring, the wood turtle is active during the daytime (usually from about 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.) and will almost always be found within several hundred metres of a stream. The early morning and late afternoon are preferred foraging periods. Throughout this season, the wood turtle uses logs, sandy shores, or banks to bask in sunlight. In order to maintain its body temperatures through thermoregulation, it spends a considerable amount of time basking, most of which takes place in the late morning and late afternoon. The wood turtle reaches a peak body temperature of after basking. During times of extreme heat, it has been known to estivate. Several reports mention individuals resting under vegetation, fallen debris and in shallow puddles. During the summer, the wood turtle is considered a largely terrestrial animal. At night, its average body temperature drops to between and it will rest in small creeks or nearby land (usually in areas containing some sort of underbrush or grass). During warmer weather, the wood turtle stays in the water for a larger percentage of the time. For this reason, during the winter months (and the late fall and early spring) it is considered an aquatic turtle. November through February or March is spent in hibernation at the bottom of a small, flowing river. The wood turtle may hibernate alone or in large groups. During this period, individuals bury themselves in the thick mud at the bottom of the river and rarely move. During hibernation, it is vulnerable to flash floods. Emergence does not occur until March or sometimes April, months that mark the beginning of its activation period (males are typically more active than females at this time). Males are known to be aggressive, with larger and older turtles being more dominant. Larger males rank higher on the social hierarchy often created by wood turtle colonies. In the wild, the submissive turtle is either forced to flee, or is bombarded with physical abuses, which include biting, shoving, and ramming. Larger and more dominant males will sometimes try to remove a subordinate male while he is mating with a female. The defender will, if he does not successfully fight for his position, lose the female to the larger male. Therefore, among males, there is a direct relationship between copulation opportunities and social rank. However, the outcome of encounters between two turtles is more aggression-dependent than size-dependent. The wood turtle that is more protective of his or her area is the victor. Physical bouts between wood turtles (regardless of sex) increases marginally during the fall and spring (times of mating). The wood turtle is omnivorous, feeding mainly on plant matter and animals both on land and in water. It eats prey such as beetles, millipedes, and slugs. Also, wood turtles consume specific fungi (Amanita muscaria and Leccinum arcolatum), mosses, grasses, various insects, and also carrion. On occasion, it can be seen stomping the ground with alternating hits of the left and right front feet. This behavior is thought to imitate the sound of falling rain, sometimes causing earthworms to rise to the surface where they quickly become easy prey. When hunting, the wood turtle pokes its head into such areas as dead and decaying logs, the bottoms of bushes, and in other vegetation. In the water, it exhibits similar behavior, searching algae beds and cavities along the sides of the stream or river. Many different animals are predators of or otherwise pose a threat to the wood turtle. They include snapping turtles, raccoons, otters, foxes, and cats. All of these species destroy unhatched eggs and prey upon hatchlings and juveniles. Several animals that often target wood turtle eggs are the common raven and coyote, which may completely destroy the nests they encounter. Evidence of predatory attacks (wounds to the skin and such) are common on individuals, but the northern populations tend to display more scarring than the southern ones. In addition to these threats, wood turtles also suffer from leech infestations. =Movement= The wood turtle can travel at a relatively fast speed (upwards of ); it also travels long distances during the months that it is active. In one instance, of nine turtles studied, the average distance covered in a 24-hour period was , with a net displacement of . The wood turtle, an intelligent animal, has homing capabilities. Its mental capacity for directional movement was discovered after the completion of an experiment that involved an individual finding food in a maze. The results proved that these turtles have locating abilities similar to that of a rat. This was also proved by another, separate experiment. One male wood turtle was displaced after being captured, and within five weeks, it returned to the original location. The homing ability of the wood turtle does not vary among sexes, age groups, or directions of travel. =Life cycle= alt=On a small rock ledge, this turtle is leaning over, readying to go for a swim. The wood turtle takes a long time to reach sexual maturity, has a low fecundity (ability to reproduce), but has a high adult survival rate. However, the high survival rates are not true of juveniles or hatchlings. Although males establish hierarchies, they are not territorial. The wood turtle becomes sexually mature between 14 and 18 years of age. Mating activity among wood turtles peaks in the spring and again in the fall, although it is known to mate throughout the portion of the year they are active. However, it has been observed mating in December. In one rare instance, a female wood turtle hybridized with a male Blanding's turtle. The courtship ritual consists of several hours of 'dancing,' which usually occurs on the edge of a small stream. Males often initiate this behavior: starting by nudging the females shell, head, tail, and legs. Because of this behavior, the female may flee from the area, in which case the male will follow. After the chase (if it occurs), the male and female approach and back away from each other as they continually raise and extend their heads. After some time, they lower their heads and swing them from left to right. Once it is certain that the two individuals will mate, the male will gently bite the female's head and mount her. Intercourse lasts between 22 and 33 minutes. Actual copulation takes place in the water, between depths between . Although unusual, copulation does occur on land. During the two prominent times of mating (spring and fall), females are mounted anywhere from one to eight times, with several of these causing impregnation. For this reason, a number of wood turtle clutches have been found to have hatchlings from more than one male. Nesting occurs from May until July. Nesting areas receive ample sunlight, contain soft soil, are free from flooding, and are devoid of rocks and disruptively large vegetation. These sites however, can be limited among wood turtle colonies, forcing females to travel long distances in search of a suitable site, sometimes a trip. Before laying her eggs, the female may prepare several false nests. After a proper area is found, she will dig out a small cavity, lay about seven eggs (but anywhere from three to 20 is common), and fill in the area with earth. Oval and white, the eggs average in length and in width, and weigh about . The nests themselves are deep, and digging and filling it may take a total of four hours. Hatchlings emerge from the nest between August and October with overwintering being rare although entirely possible. An average length of , the hatchlings lack the vibrant coloration of the adults. Female wood turtles in general lay one clutch per year and tend to congregate around optimal nesting areas. The wood turtle, throughout the first years of its life, is a rapid grower. Five years after hatching, it already measures , at age 16, it is a full , depending on sex. The wood turtle can be expected to live for 40 years in the wild, with captives living up to 58 years. The wood turtle is the only known turtle species in existence that has been observed committing same-sex intercourse.Biol. Exuberance: Wood Turtle - Bagemihl (1999 AD), page 657 Same-sex behavior in tortoises is known in more than one species. Mating system Specific mating courtship occurs more often in the Fall months and usually during the afternoon hours from 11:00 to 13:00 when many of the turtles are out in the population feeding. Mating is based on a male competitive hierarchy where a few higher ranked males gain the majority of mates in the population. Male wood turtles fight to gain access to female mates. These fights involve aggressive behaviors such as biting or chasing one another, and the males defend themselves by retreating their heads into their hard shells. The higher ranked winning males in the hierarchy system have a greater number of offspring than the lower ranked male individuals, increasing the dominant male's fitness. Female wood turtles mate with multiple males and are able to store sperm from multiple mates. Although the mechanism of sperm storage is unknown for the Wood Turtle species, other turtle species have internal compartments that can store viable sperm for years. Multiple mating ensures fertilization of all the female's eggs and often results in multiple paternity of a clutch, which is a common phenomenon exhibited by many marine and freshwater turtles. Multiple paternity patterns have been made evident in wood turtle populations by DNA fingerprinting. DNA fingerprinting of turtles involves using an oligonucleotide probe to produce sex specific markers, ultimately providing multi-locus DNA markers. Conservation Female wood turtle with radio transmitter Despite many sightings and a seemingly large and diverse distribution, wood turtle numbers are in decline. Many deaths caused by humans result from: habitat destruction, farming accidents, and road traffic. Also, it is commonly collected illegally for the international pet trade. These combined threats have caused many areas where they live to enact laws protecting it. Despite legislation, enforcement of the laws and education of the public regarding the species are minimal. For proper protection of the wood turtle, in-depth land surveys of its habitat to establish population numbers are needed. One emerging solution to the highway mortality problem, which primarily affects nesting females, is the construction of under-road channels. These tunnels allow the wood turtle to pass under the road, a solution that helps prevent accidental deaths. Brochures and other media that warn people to avoid keeping the wood turtle as a pet are currently being distributed. Next, leaving nests undisturbed, especially common nesting sites and populations, is the best solution to enable the wood turtle's survival. While considered nationally as threatened by COSEWIC, the wood turtle is listed as vulnerable within the province of Nova Scotia under the Species at Risk Act. The species is highly susceptible to human land use activities, and special management practices for woodlands, rivers and farmland areas as well as motor vehicle use restrictions and general disruption protection during critical times such as nesting and movement to overwintering habitat is closely monitored. Since 2012, the Clean Annapolis River Project (CARP) has provided research and stewardship for this species including the identification of crucial habitats, distribution and movement estimation, and outreach.

Soon The Knack's drummer Bruce Gary suggested that they add Crespo to their line up. After Koslen left the group, they tried a series of notable drummers until Taylor ultimately fit best. In spite of the critic's raves and great national press and television exposure, the group split apart due to drug problems and the eventual marital breakup of founders Sheridan and Bramlett. Several CDs worth of material still await a number of legal battles before they can be released.

Activism Casta√±eda was born in Guatemala City, into a middle class family. He started attending the Department of Economics at the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala (USAC) in 1975, and became a dynamic member of the Students' Association (Asociaci√≥n de Estudiantes Universitarios, AEU) of the USAC, to which he was elected secretary general on May 22, 1978. He was highly involved in political activities, and organized many protest marches against the government in response to state-sponsored human rights violations. In September 1978 he helped organize a general strike to protest sharp increases in public transportation fares. The government responded harshly, arresting dozens of protesters and injuring many more. As a result of the campaign, the government agreed to the protesters' demands, including the establishment of a public transportation subsidy. Fearful that this concession would encourage more protests, the military government, along with state-sponsored paramilitary death squads, generated an unsafe situation for Casta√±eda and other public leaders. On October 6, a former directive of the Mail and Telegraph Workers' Syndicate was assassinated by a death squad. Assassination On October 19, the eve of a traditional march to commemorate the 1944 Revolution, a death threat against 39 citizens was made by the self- proclaimed Anti-Communist Army (Ej√©rcito Secreto Anticomunista, ESA), a list including Oliverio Casta√±eda's name. Due to the recent events, measures had been adopted to protect Casta√±eda even before these threats. However, he and other leaders decided to participate in the October 20 March. The march concluded without incidents in the Parque Centenario near the government palace (Palacio Nacional), where Casta√±eda gave a speech in which he pointed out violations to human rights involving state security forces. The famous final words of his speech, \\"They can kill our leaders, but as long as there are people, there will be revolution\\", were tragically visionary. Around 1 p.m., he and a group of students walked away from the park and when they crossed the Sexta Avenida, a major street of Guatemala City, one block away from the Palacio Nacional, several gunshots started, and a man got off a car opening fire with a machine gun against Casta√±eda. The latter was reached by a bullet and fell, and after that another man coming out of another vehicle stopped and gave him the coup de gr√¢ce. The perpetrators left the crime scene without the intervention of any policemen in the surroundings, and Casta√±eda died shortly after that due to the several lethal wounds. Other people were injured during the shooting. The finishing shot was an evidence that Casta√±eda had been the victim of a deliberate attack, in the same context as other similar cases affecting student leaders, and was linked to a government speech accusing the USAC of subversive activity. Consequences The impunity of this crime, and the lack of investigation from state authorities led the Guatemalan Historical Clarification Commission (Comisi√≥n para el Esclarecimiento Hist√≥rico, CEH) to consider Casta√±eda's death a violation of human rights, and to presume the Intelligence Division of the Estado Mayor Presidencial to be responsible for it. The Universidad de San Carlos's students' association was soon after renamed Asociaci√≥n de Estudiantes Universitarios\\" Oliverio Casta√±eda de Le√≥n\\". The segment of the street in which he was killed was renamed \\"Oliverio Casta√±eda de Le√≥n\\" in his honor in 2003. 30 years after Oliverio Casta√±eda's murder, the president of Guatemala Alvaro Colom awarded him the country's highest award, the \\"Orden del Quetzal\\". The president asked his family for forgiveness on behalf of the Guatemalan government and expressed: \\"A medal can't bring even a second of his life back, but will serve to give testimony of his life\\". The award was received by his mother and other members of his family.

A graduate of Madison (WI) East High School and Stanford University, he is best known for winning the 2000 USA Olympic Trials in the 1500 m with a time of 3:35.90. In 2003, after a poor 2002 season in which he failed to live up to the expectations generated by his previous success, Jennings biked from California to Brazil.Track and Field News: Features: Gabe Jennings: Walkabout Gabe also plays several instruments, including the didgeridoo and the berimbau. High school =Sophomore year= After growing up in a northern California, Gabe Jennings and his family then moved to Madison, Wisconsin, where Gabe enrolled in Madison East High School. In the fall of 1994, Gabe qualified for the WIAA Division 1 State Cross Country Championships and placed eighth overall. In the spring of 1995, he won State titles in both the 1600 m (4:15.6) and 3200 m (9:15.7). =Junior year= Jennings won the 1995 WIAA State Cross Country title. He then qualified for the Foot Locker Cross Country Championships, where he placed seventh overall with a time of 15:29. In track, he won the Penn Relays high school 1500 m title in 3:50.84. At the 1996 WIAA State Track & Field Championships, he won three individual distance events: 800 m (1:54.4), 1600 m (4:12.1) and 3200 m. =Senior year= As a senior, Jennings again won the individual state title in cross country. He also qualified for the Foot Locker Cross Country Championships again, and as the second highest returning athlete was one of the favorites for the title. However, a sideache limited Gabe to a 27th place finish among the 32 runners. During the track & field season, Gabe once again won the Penn Relays high school 1500 m title with a time of 3:45.98. Rather than once again attempt the distance triple at the WIAA State Track & Field Championships, Gabe sacrificed the open 3200 m to run with his teammates in the 4x800 m Relay. He split a 1:50.7 to move Madison East into fifth place with an overall time of 7:59.35. Jenning then won the 1600 m with a time of 4:04.97, claiming the State record, and the 800 m with a time of 1:52.18 to finish his high school career with nine State titles. A few weeks later at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Oregon, Gabe ran a Mile time of 4:02.81, the fastest prep Mile in 23 years. He still has the fastest 1500 m, 1600 m and Mile times in Wisconsin prep history, along with the seventh best time in the 800 m. College =Freshman year= Gabe was part of an unbelievable freshman class of milers at Stanford that also included future Olympian Jonathon Riley. With a powerhouse cross country team returning (Stanford was the defending NCAA champ), the Cardinal redshirted Gabe. He did, however, carry on one Stanford tradition: winning the US Junior National Cross Country Championships (marking the fourth year in a row it was won by an athlete from Stanford). A team made up of Stanford athletes called the Cardinal Harriers easily took the team title with just 19 points. Stanford did not redshirt Gabe for the Track & Field season. By any standard, Gabe had a very successful freshman campaign, finishing as the top freshman in the nation in the 800 m, 1500 m and 3000 m. The only freshman ranked ahead of him in the 5000 m was his own teammate, Jonathon Riley. He ran the second fastest 3000 m time (7:58.40) ever by an American Junior, and he was the first American Junior to break 4:00 in the mile in over 12 years. On the NCAA level, he was just as successful, earning Indoor All-American honors by finishing fourth in the 3000 m at the NCAA Indoor Track & Field Championships. A few months later at the NCAA Outdoor Track & Field Championships, Gabe was leaned out at the tape for the win in the 1500 m final. In the summer, he won both the 1500 m and 5000 m races at the US Junior Track & Field Championships, then placed fifth overall in the 1500 m at the World Junior Championships. In a display of his incredible range, Gabe took fifth at the US Track & Field Championships in the 800 m with a personal best of 1:46.99. =Sophomore year= While the cross country season did not go quite as well as predicted, Gabe still won the Cardinal Invitational. His poor showing at the Pac-10 Championships kept him off the NCAA team. Stanford, as a team, would end up second behind the University of Arkansas. Gabe redshirted the indoor season, then, in a surprising move, the Cardinal redshirted both Gabe and powerhouse teammate Michael Stember for the outdoor season. Stanford fell just seven points short of the NCAA Outdoor team title, which made the move to redshirt Stember and Jennings so puzzling, especially when the two placed 4-5, respectively, at the US Outdoor Track & Field Championships in the 1500 m. Gabe was able to get some international experience by competing in races over in Europe. =Junior year= Gabe started his cross country season on top by winning the BYU Invitational, which Stanford won easily. He finished 18th at the Stanford Invitational and 48th at Pre-Nationals while Stanford again won both team titles. The Cardinal suffered their first defeat of the season at the hands of Arizona at the Pac-10 Championships, where Gabe finished 20th overall. Running perhaps his best race of the year, Gabe finished fourth at the NCAA West Regional to lead Stanford to the team title. His luck (and his team's luck) did not continue at the NCAA Championships, where Gabe placed 123rd overall and Stanford managed a fourth place finish. The 2000 track & field season was a breakout one for Gabe Jennings. He ran the lead-off 1200 m leg of Stanford's Distance Medley Relay that won the NCAA Indoor championship and set a new indoor World Record with a time of 9:28.83. The next day, he also won the mile (3:59.46) while his teammate Michael Stember finished second. Jennings came back a few hours later to place seventh in the 3000 m (8:04.96) to earn his third All-American plaque of the meet. Stanford finished second overall as a team (for the third consecutive year). Outdoors, Gabe and Stember again finished 1-2 at the NCAA Championships, this time in the 1500 m. It was Gabe's third NCAA title of the year, but more importantly, Stanford won the overall team title (its first in 66 years). Despite his success during the year, Gabe was only considered a mild threat to make the United States Olympic team in the 1500 m. The prohibitive favorites at the Trials were previous Olympians like Paul McMullen and Steve Holman. Gabe and his teammate, Michael Stember, made some noise by finishing 1-2 in their qualifying heat to make the finals. After jostling around with the pack for the first two laps of the final, Gabe made a big move and shot out to almost a 30 m lead. He kept chugging and crossed the line first in a new personal best of 3:35.90 to qualify for the Olympic team. Stember was no better than sixth with 100 m to go, but held his form and finished third in a personal best of 3:37.04. While Gabe's time qualified him for the Olympics, Stember's did not, so he had to chase the time all summer, finally achieving it in his final attempt. At the Olympics, Gabe finished sixth in his preliminary heat to advance to the semifinals. But his Olympic dream would end in the semis when he got outkicked for a spot in the finals.

Voorhoeve (1970). \\"Kerintji documents\\", In: Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 126, no: 4, Leiden, 369-399. The text reads (Voorhoeve's spelling): \\"haku manangis ma / njaru ka'u ka'u di / saru tijada da / tang [hitu hadik sa]\\", which is translated by Voorhoeve as: \\"I am weeping, calling you; though called, you do not come\\" (hitu adik sa- is the rest of 4th line.) Malay is a major language of the Austronesian language family. Over a period of two millennia, from a form that probably consisted of only 157 original words, Malay has undergone various stages of development that derived from different layers of foreign influences through international trade, religious expansion, colonisation and developments of new socio- political trends. The oldest form of Malay is descended from the Proto-Malayo- Polynesian language spoken by the earliest Austronesian settlers in Southeast Asia. This form would later evolve into Old Malay when Indian cultures and religions began penetrating the region. Old Malay contained some terms that exist today, but are unintelligible to modern speakers, while the modern language is already largely recognisable in written Classical Malay of 1303 CE. Malay evolved extensively into Classical Malay through the gradual influx of numerous elements of Arabic and Persian vocabulary when Islam made its way to the region. Initially, Classical Malay was a diverse group of dialects, reflecting the varied origins of the Malay kingdoms of Southeast Asia. One of these dialects that was developed in the literary tradition of Melaka in the 15th century, eventually became predominant. The strong influence of Melaka in international trade in the region resulted in Malay as a lingua franca in commerce and diplomacy, a status that it maintained throughout the age of the succeeding Malay sultanates, the European colonial era and the modern times. From 19th to 20th century, Malay evolved progressively through a significant grammatical improvements and lexical enrichment into a modern language with more than 800,000 phrases in various disciplines. Ancient Malay Ancient Malay, or Proto-Malay, is the language believed to have existed in prehistoric times, spoken by the early Austronesian settlers in the region. Its ancestor, the Proto-Malayo-Polynesian language that derived from Proto-Austronesian, began to break up by at least 2000 BCE as a result possibly by the southward expansion of Austronesian peoples into the Philippines, Borneo, Maluku and Sulawesi from the island of Taiwan. Proto-Malay language was spoken in Borneo at least by 1000 BCE and was, it has been argued, the ancestral language of all subsequent Malay dialects. Linguists generally agree that the homeland of the Malayic-Dayak languages is in Borneo, based on its geographic spread in the interior, its variations that are not due to contact-induced change, and its sometimes conservative character. Around the beginning of the first millennium, Malayic speakers had established settlements in the coastal regions of modern-day South Central Vietnam, Tambelan, Riau Islands, Sumatra, Malay peninsula, Borneo, Luzon, Maluku Islands, Bangka-Belitung Islands and Java. Old Malay (7th to 14th century) The beginning of the common era saw the growing influence of Indian civilisation in the archipelago. With the penetration and proliferation of Dravidian vocabulary and the influence of major Indian religions, Ancient Malay evolved into the Old Malay language. The Dong Yen Chau inscription, believed to be from the 4th century CE, was discovered in the northwest of Tra Kieu, near the old Champa capital of Indrapura, modern day Vietnam; however, it is considered to be in the related Old Cham language rather than Old Malay by experts such as Graham Thurgood. The oldest uncontroversial specimen of Old Malay is the 7th century CE Sojomerto inscription from Central Java, Kedukan Bukit Inscription from South Sumatra and several other inscriptions dating from the 7th to 10th centuries discovered in Sumatra, Malay peninsula, western Java, other islands of the Sunda archipelago, and Luzon. All these Old Malay inscriptions used either scripts of Indian origin such as Pallava, Nagari or the Indian-influenced Old Sumatran characters. The Old Malay system is greatly influenced by Sanskrit scriptures in terms of phonemes, morphemes, vocabulary and the characteristics of scholarship, particularly when the words are closely related to Indian culture such as puja, kesatria, maharaja and raja, as well as on the Hindu- Buddhist religion such as dosa, pahala, neraka, syurga or surga (used in Indonesia-which was based on Malay), puasa, sami and biara, which lasts until today. It is popularly claimed that the Old Malay of the Srivijayan inscriptions from South Sumatra is the ancestor of the Classical Malay. However, as noted by some linguists, the precise relationship between these two, whether ancestral or not, is problematical and remained uncertain. This is due to the existence of a number of morphological and syntactic peculiarities, and affixes which are familiar from the related Batak and Javanese languages but are not found even in the oldest manuscripts of Classical Malay. It may be the case that the language of the Srivijayan inscriptions is a close cousin rather than an ancestor of Classical Malay. Moreover, although the earliest evidence of Classical Malay had been found in the Malay peninsula from 1303, Old Malay remained in use as a written language in Sumatra right up to the end of the 14th century, evidenced from Bukit Gombak inscription dated 1357 and Tanjung Tanah manuscript of Adityavarman era (1347‚Äì1375). Classical Malay (14th to 18th century) The Terengganu Inscription Stone, written in year 1303. The period of Classical Malay started when Islam gained its foothold in the region and the elevation of its status to a state religion. As a result of Islamisation and growth in trade with the Muslim world, this era witnessed the penetration of Arabic and Persian vocabulary as well as the integration of major Islamic cultures with local Malay culture. Earliest instances of Arabic lexicons incorporated in the pre- classical Malay written in Kawi was found in the Minyetujoh inscription dated 1380 from Aceh. Pre-Classical Malay took on a more radical form as attested in the 1303 CE Terengganu Inscription Stone and the 1468 CE Pengkalan Kempas Inscription from Malay peninsula. Both inscriptions not only serve as the evidence of Islam as a state religion, but also as the oldest surviving specimen of the dominant classical orthographic form, the Jawi script. Similar inscriptions containing various adopted Arabic terms with some of them still written the indianised scripts were also discovered in Sumatra and Borneo. The Pre-Classical Malay evolved and reached its refined form during the golden age of the Malay empire of Melaka and its successor Johor starting from the 15th century. As a bustling port city with a diverse population of 200,000 from different nations, the largest in Southeast Asia at that time, Melaka became a melting pot of different cultures and languages. More loan words from Arab, Persian, Tamil and Chinese were absorbed and the period witnessed the flowering of Malay literature as well as professional development in royal leadership and public administration. In contrast with Old Malay, the literary themes of Melaka had expanded beyond the decorative belles-lettres and theological works, evidenced with the inclusion of accountancy, maritime laws, credit notes and trade licenses in its literary tradition. Some prominent manuscripts of this category are Undang-Undang Melaka ('Laws of Melaka'), Undang-Undang Laut Melaka (Melakan Maritime Laws) and Hukum Kanun Pahang ('Laws of Pahang'). The literary tradition was further enriched with the translations of various foreign literary works such as Hikayat Muhammad Hanafiah and Hikayat Amir Hamzah, and the emergence of new intellectual writings in philosophy, tasawuf, tafsir, history and many others in Malay, represented by manuscripts like Sulalatus al-Salatin and Furu' Al-Masa'il. Melaka's success as a centre of commerce, religion, and literary output has made it an important point of cultural reference to the many influential Malay sultanates in the later centuries. This has resulted the growing importance of Classical Malay as the sole lingua franca of the region. Through inter-ethnic contact and trade, the Classical Malay spread beyond the traditional Malay speaking world and resulted in a trade language that was called Bahasa Melayu pasar (\\"Bazaar Malay\\") or Bahasa Melayu rendah (\\"Low Malay\\") as opposed to Bahasa Melayu tinggi (High Malay) of Melaka-Johor. It is generally believed that Bazaar Malay was a pidgin, perhaps influenced by contact between Malay, Chinese and non-Malay natives traders. The most important development, however, has been that pidgin Malay creolised, creating several new languages such as the Ambonese Malay, Manado Malay, Makassar Malay and Betawi language. Apart from being the primary instrument in spreading Islam and commercial activities, Malay also became a court and literary language for kingdoms beyond its traditional realm like Aceh, Banjar and Ternate and also used in diplomatic communications with the European colonial powers. This is evidenced from diplomatic letters from Sultan Abu Hayat II of Ternate to King John III of Portugal dated from 1521 to 1522, a letter from Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah of Aceh to Captain Sir Henry Middleton of the East India Company dated 1602, and a golden letter from Sultan Iskandar Muda of Aceh to King James I of England dated 1615. Frontispiece of a copy of Sulalatus al-Salatin The early phase of European colonisation in Southeast Asia began with the arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century and the Dutch in the 17th century. This period also marked the dawn of Christianization in the region with its stronghold in Ambon, Banda and Batavia. In facilitating early missionary works, religious books and manuscripts began to be translated into Malay of which the earliest was initiated by a pious Dutch trader, Albert Ruyll in 1611. The book titled Sovrat A B C and written in Latin alphabet not only means in introducing Latin alphabet but also the basic tenets of Calvinism that includes the Ten Commandments, the faith and some prayers. This work later followed by several Bibles translated into Malay; Injil Mateus dan Markus (1638), Lukas dan Johanes (1646), Injil dan Perbuatan (1651), Kitab Kejadian (1662), Perjanjian Baru (1668) and Mazmur (1689). The era of Classical Malay also witnessed the growing interest among foreigners in learning the Malay language for the purpose of commerce, diplomatic missions and missionary activities. Therefore, many books in the form of word-list or dictionary were written. The oldest of these was a Chinese-Malay word list compiled by the Ming officials of the Bureau of Translators during the heyday of Melaka Sultanate. The dictionary was known as Ma La Jia Guo Yi Yu (Words-list of Melaka Kingdom) and contains 482 entries categorised into 17 fields namely astronomy, geography, seasons and times, plants, birds and animals, houses and palaces, human behaviours and bodies, gold and jewelleries, social and history, colours, measurements and general words. In the 16th century, the word-list is believed still in use in China when a royal archive official Yang Lin reviewed the record in 1560 CE. In 1522, the first European-Malay word-list was compiled by an Italian explorer Antonio Pigafetta, who joined the Magellan's circumnavigation expedition. The Italian-Malay word-list by Pigafetta contains approximately 426 entries and became the main reference for the later Latin-Malay and French-Malay dictionaries. Pre-Modern Malay (19th century) A page of Hikayat Abdullah written in Jawi script, from the collection of the National Library of Singapore. A rare first edition, it was written between 1840 and 1843, printed by lithography, and published in 1849. 19th century was the period of strong Western political and commercial domination in Southeast Asia. The Dutch East India Company had effectively colonised the East Indies, the British Empire held several colonies and protectorates in Malay peninsula, Sarawak and North Borneo, the French possessed part of Indo-China, the Portuguese established their outposts in Timor, while the Spaniards and later the Americans gained control over the Philippines, where the Malay language did not thrive. The Dutch and British colonists, realising the importance in understanding the local languages and cultures particularly Malay, began establishing various centres of linguistic, literature and cultural studies in universities like Leiden and London. Thousands of Malay manuscripts as well as other historical artefacts of Malay culture were collected and studied. The use of Latin script began to expand in the fields of administration and education whereby the influence of English and Dutch literatures and languages started to penetrate and spread gradually into the Malay language. At the same time, the technological development in printing method that enabled mass production at low prices increased the activities of authorship for general reading in the Malay language, a development that would later shifted away Malay literature from its traditional position in Malay courts. In addition, the report writing style of journalism began to bloom in the arena of Malay writing. A notable writer of this time was Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir with his famous works Hikayat Abdullah, Kisah Pelayaran Abdullah ke Kelantan and Kisah Pelayaran Abdullah ke Mekah. Abdullah's authorship marks an early stage in the transition from the classical to modern literature, taking Malay literature out of its preoccupation with folk-stories and legends into accurate historical descriptions. Many other well known books were published such as two notable classical literary work, Sulalatus Salatin and Taj Al-Salatin. There were other famous religious books of the era which were not only published locally but also in countries like Egypt and Turkey. Among the earliest examples of Malay newspapers are Soerat Kabar Bahasa Malaijoe of Surabaya published in 1856, Bintang Timor of Padang published in 1965 and Jawi Peranakan of Singapore published in 1876. There was even a Malay newspaper published in Sri Lanka in 1869, known as Alamat Langkapuri. Earlier in 1821, the first Malay magazine was published in Melaka known as Bustan Arifin and in 1856, a Malay magazine titled Bintang Oetara was published in Amsterdam. In education, the Malay language of Melaka-Johor was regarded as the standard language and became the medium of instruction in schools during colonial era. Starting from 1821, Malay-medium Schools were established by the British colonial government in Penang, Melaka and Singapore. These were followed by many others in Malay states of the peninsular. This development generated the writings of text books for schools, in addition to the publication of reference materials such as Malay dictionaries and grammar books. Apart from that, an important position was given towards the use of Malay in British administration, which requires every public servant in service to pass the special examination in Malay language as a condition for a confirmed post, as gazetted in Straits Government Gazette 1859. In Indonesia, the Dutch colonial government recognised the Melaka-Johor Malay used in Riau as High Malay and promoted it as a medium of communication between the Dutch and local population. The language was also taught in schools not only in Riau, but also East Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan and East Indonesia. Modern Malay (20th century) The flourishing of pre-modern Malay literature in 19th century led to the rise of intellectual movement among the locals and the emergence of new community of Malay linguists. The appreciation of language grew and various efforts were undertaken by the community to further enhance the usage of Malay as well as to improve its abilities in facing the challenging modern era. Among the efforts done was the planning of a corpus for Malay language, first initiated by Pakatan Belajar-Mengajar Pengetahuan Bahasa (Society for the Learning and Teaching of Linguistic Knowledge), established in 1888. The society that was renamed in 1935 as Pakatan Bahasa Melayu dan Persuratan Buku Diraja Johor (The Johor Royal Society of Malay language and Literary works), involved actively in arranging and compiling the guidelines for spelling, dictionaries, grammars, punctuations, letters, essays, terminologies and many others. The establishment of Sultan Idris Training College (SITC) in Tanjung Malim, Perak in 1922 intensified these efforts. In 1936, Za'ba, an outstanding Malay scholar and lecturer of SITC, produced a Malay grammar book series entitled Pelita Bahasa that modernised the structure of the Classical Malay language and became the basis for the Malay language that is in use today. The most important change was in syntax, from the classical passive form to the modern active form. In the 20th century, other improvements were also carried out by other associations, organisations, governmental institutions and congresses in various part of the region. Writing has its unique place in the history of self-awareness and the nationalist struggle in Indonesia and Malaysia. Apart from being the main tools to spread knowledge and information, newspapers and journals like Al-Imam (1906), Panji Poestaka (1912), Lembaga Melayu (1914), Warta Malaya (1931), Poedjangga Baroe (1933) and Utusan Melayu (1939) became the main thrust in championing and shaping the fight for nationalism. Writing, whether in the form of novels, short stories, or poems, all played distinct roles in galvanising the spirit of Indonesian National Awakening and Malay nationalism. During the first Kongres Pemuda of Indonesia held in 1926, in the Sumpah Pemuda, Malay language was proclaimed as the unifying language for the nation of Indonesia. In 1945, the language which later renamed \\"Bahasa Indonesia\\", or Indonesian in 1928 became the national language as enshrined in the constitution of an independent Indonesia. Later in 1957, Malay language was elevated to the status of national language for the independent Federation of Malaya (later reconstituted as Malaysia in 1963). Then in 1959, Malay language also received the status of national language in Brunei, although it only ceased to become a British protectorate in 1984. When Singapore separated from Malaysia in 1965, Malay became the national language of the new republic and one of the four official languages. The emergence of these newly independent states paved the way for a broader and widespread use of Malay (or Indonesian) in government administration and education. Colleges and universities with Malay as their primary medium of instructions were introduced and bloomed as the prominent centres for researches and production of new intellectual writings in Malay. After East Timor independence, Indonesian language become one of the working languages. The Indonesian language as the unifying language for Indonesia is relatively open to accommodate influences from other Indonesian ethnics' languages, most notably Javanese as the majority ethnic group in Indonesia, Dutch as the previous coloniser, and English as the international language. As a result, Indonesian has wider sources of loanwords, as compared to Malay used in Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei. It was suggested that the Indonesian language is an artificial language made official in 1928. By artificial it means that Indonesian was designed by academics rather than evolving naturally as most common languages have, to accommodate the political purpose of establishing an official unifying language of Indonesia. By borrowing heavily from numerous other languages it expresses a natural linguistic evolution; in fact, it is as natural as the next language, as demonstrated in its exceptional capacity for absorbing foreign vocabulary. This disparate evolution of Indonesian language led to a need for an institution that can facilitate co-ordination and co- operation in linguistic development among countries with Malay language as their national language. The first instance of linguistic co-operation was in 1959 between Malaya and Indonesia, and this was further strengthened in 1972 when MBIM (a short form for Majlis Bahasa Indonesia-Malaysia ‚Äì Language Council of Indonesia-Malaysia) was formed. MBIM later grew into MABBIM (Majlis Bahasa Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia ‚Äì Language Council of Brunei-Indonesia- Malaysia) in 1985 with the inclusion of Brunei as a member and Singapore as a permanent observer. Other important institution is Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka established in 1956. It is a government body responsible for co-ordinating the use of the Malay language in Malaysia and Brunei. The dominant orthographic form of Modern Malay language that based on Roman or Latin script, the Malay alphabet, was first developed in the early 20th century. As the Malay-speaking countries were divided between two colonial administrations (the Dutch and the British), two major different spelling orthographies were developed in the Dutch East Indies and British Malaya respectively, influenced by the orthographies of their respective colonial tongues. In 1901, Van Ophuijsen Spelling System (1901‚Äì1947) became the standard orthography for Malay Language in Dutch East Indies. In the following year, the government of the Federated Malay States established an orthographic commission headed by Sir Richard James Wilkinson which later developed the \\"Wilkinson Spelling System\\" (1904‚Äì1933). These spelling systems would later succeeded by the Republican Spelling System (1947‚Äì1972) and the Za'ba Spelling System (1933‚Äì1942) respectively. During the Japanese Occupation of Malaya and Indonesia, there emerged a system which was supposed to uniformise the systems in the two countries. The system known as Fajar Asia (or 'the Dawn of Asia') appeared to use the Republican system of writing the vowels and the Malayan system of writing the consonants. This system only existed during the Occupation. In 1972, a declaration was made for a joint spelling system in both nations, known as Ejaan Rumi Baharu (New Rumi Spelling) in Malaysia and Sistem Ejaan Yang Disempurnakan (Perfected Spelling System) in Indonesia. With the introduction of this new common spelling system, all administrative documents, teaching and learning materials and all forms of written communication is based on a relatively uniform spelling system and this helps in effective and efficient communication, particularly in national administration and education. Despite the widespread and institutionalised use of Malay alphabet, Jawi script remains as one of the two official scripts in Brunei, and is used as an alternate script in Malaysia. Day-to-day usage of Jawi is maintained in more conservative Malay-populated areas such as Pattani in Thailand and Kelantan in Malaysia. The script is used for religious and Malay cultural administration in Terengganu, Kelantan, Kedah, Perlis and Johor. The influence of the script is still present in Sulu and Marawi in the Philippines while in Indonesia, Jawi script is still widely used in Riau and Riau Island province, where road signs and government buildings signs are written in this script.

Facts The Commonwealth made an amendment to the Copyright Act 1968 which was designed to compensate copyright owners for the domestic and private taping of audio material not deemed to be illegal. The money was not paid to the Commonwealth, but to a private entity that distributed the funds to copyright owners as a private copying levy. Decision The Court majority (Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Gaudron JJ) relied on dicta from Air Caledonie International v Commonwealth,. and ruled that the collecting body of a fee does not have to be a public body for the fee to be regarded as a tax. Therefore, a levy collected by a private body dictated by a statute for public purposes gives the private body a public character. The decision also raised the notion of raising taxes for the public interest. The decision also contained a strong dissent from the minority (Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ). They were critical of the dicta from Air Caledonie as it contained no principles, and no examples. They did not view the fee paid as tax because it was not paid into general government consolidated revenue (Section 81 of the Constitution requires taxes to be paid into consolidated revenue). The royalty imposed by the government was a special type of debt that did not satisfy the elements of taxation. McHugh J added that the term \\"public purpose\\" meant government purpose, and the fee imposed had no government purpose. The Commonwealth played a merely supervisory role.

In English it is generally known as \\"By the rivers of Babylon\\", which is how its first words are translated in the King James Version. It is Psalm 136 in the slightly different numbering system of the Greek Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate versions of the Bible. Its Latin title is \\"Super flumina Babylonis\\".Parallel Latin/English Psalter / Psalmus 136 (137) medievalist.net The psalm is a communal lament about being in exile after the Babylonian captivity, and yearning for Jerusalem. The psalm is a regular part of Jewish, Eastern Orthodox, Catholic, Anglican and Protestant liturgies. It has been set to music often, and was paraphrased in hymns. Context and content The journey of the Judean exiles to Babylon in the first decades of the 6th century BC. Psalm \\"By the rivers of Babylon\\" from Chludov Psalter (9th century). After Nebuchadnezzar II's successful siege of Jerusalem in 597 BC, and subsequent campaigns, inhabitants of the Kingdom of Judah were deported to Babylonia, where they were held captive until some time after the Fall of Babylon (539 BC). The rivers of Babylon are the Euphrates river, its tributaries, and the Tigris river. Psalm 137 is a hymn expressing the yearnings of the Jewish people during their Babylonian exile. In its whole form of nine verses, the psalm reflects the yearning for Jerusalem as well as hatred for the Holy City's enemies with sometimes violent imagery. Rabbinical sources attributed the poem to the prophet Jeremiah,James L. Kugel, \\"Psalm 137,\\" in In Potiphar's House: The Interpretive Life of Biblical Texts. (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1994) and the Septuagint version of the psalm bears the superscription: \\"For David. By Jeremias, in the Captivity.\\" =Verses 1‚Äì4= The early lines of the psalm describe the sadness of the Israelites in exile, weeping and hanging their harps on trees.

Psalm 137 is traditionally recited before the Birkat Hamazon (Grace After Meals) on a weekday. However, on Shabbat and Jewish holidays, and at the celebratory meal accompanying a Jewish wedding, brit milah, or pidyon haben, Psalm 126 is recited before the Birkat Hamazon instead. Verses 5 and 6 are customarily said by the groom at Jewish wedding ceremony shortly before breaking a glass as a symbolic act of mourning over the destruction of the Temple.} Verse 7 is found in the repetition of the Amidah on Rosh Hashanah.The Complete Artscroll Machzor for Rosh Hashanah page 324 Psalm 137 is one of the ten Psalms of the Tikkun HaKlali of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov. =Eastern Christianity= In the Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches that use the Byzantine Rite, Psalm 137 (known by its Septuagint numbering as Psalm 136) is a part of the Nineteenth Kathisma (division of the Psalter) and is read at Matins on Friday mornings throughout the year, except during Bright Week (the week following Easter Sunday) when no psalms at all are read. During most of Great Lent it is read at Matins on Thursday and at the Third Hour on Friday, but during the fifth week of Great Lent it is read at Vespers on Tuesday evening and at the Third Hour on Friday. This psalm is also solemnly chanted at Matins (Orthros) after the Polyeleos on the three Sundays preceding the beginning of Great Lent. =Western Christianity= Following the rule of St. Benedict (530 AD), the Roman Breviary adopted the \\"Super flumina Babylonis\\" psalm for Vespers on Wednesdays.R√®gle de saint Beno√Æt, traduction de Prosper Gu√©ranger, (Abbaye Saint-Pierre de Solesmes, r√©impression 2007) p47.Psautier latin-fran√ßais du br√©viaire monastique, p. 514, 1938/2003. In the Roman Missal, before the Vatican II reforms, the first verse of the psalm was the Offertory in the Mass on the 20th Sunday after Pentecost. In Lutheranism, a well-known hymn based on the psalm has been associated with a Gospel reading in which Jesus foretells and mourns the destruction of Jerusalem (). After the Second Vatican Council, the last three verses of the psalm were removed from Catholic liturgical books because of their cruelty perceived to be incompatible with the gospel message.Marc Girard (May 2006). Faut-il prier au complet le psaume 136 (137)? at (website of the Dominican Order of Canada) In the post-Vatican II three-year cycle of the Catholic mass liturgy, the psalm is part of the service on Laetare Sunday, that is the fourth Sunday in Lent, of the \\"B\\" cycle. Similarly, the Prayer Book of the Anglican Church of Canada has also removed these verses.http://prayerbook.ca/resources/bcponline/psalter/ Translations, versifications and settings Dachstein's \\"An Wasserfl√ºssen Babylon\\" in a 1541 edition of the Stra√üburger Gesangbuch (Strasbourg Hymnal) Early version of Bach's An Wasserfl√ºssen Babylon chorale prelude, BWV 653 Psalm 137 set to music in a French Protestant psalm book of 1817 By the rivers of Babylon, painting by Eduard Bendemann, By the Waters of Babylon, painting by Arthur Hacker, By the rivers of Babylon, painting by Gebhard Fugel, The psalm has been set to music by many composers.

He ran 181 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series races during his career, notably racing for Bud Moore Engineering and Junior Johnson & Associates. Dieringer won seven races and recorded 79 top ten finishes. Racing career = Early years = Dieringer began to race in 1949 in and around his native Indianapolis, and had offers to race IndyCars. = NASCAR = Dieringer began to race in the NASCAR Grand National Series in 1957, running nine races for three owners and finishing in the top ten twice, the first being in only his third race. He did not finish a race in 1958, and did not run a Grand National race again until 1961, where sporadic runs throughout the season culminated in one race for Petty Enterprises late in the year. The following year, Dieringer ran at Daytona with Ray Fox, but from that point ran part-time in other lower-tier equipment. For 1963, Dieringer teamed up with Bill Stroppe and Mario Rossi to run Mercury Marauders, as they would over the next several years. Dieringer found the checkered flag at Riverside International Raceway in the season's final race, finished outside the top ten only five times, and finished seventh in points despite running less than half of the season's 55 races. He seemed set to go for the next season, but early season difficulties forced Stroppe to withdraw his team, leaving Dieringer to search for a new team. Taking his Marauder with him, Dieringer quickly found a home at Bud Moore Engineering, taking the pole for the summer Daytona race and winning a late-season road course race in Georgia. 1965 was the closest Dieringer ever came to running a full season in NASCAR, participating in 35 of 55 events. He ran with Moore for the premier events, winning the pole for the 1965 Daytona 500 and finishing second. Piecing together a partial schedule with several different owners for smaller races, Dieringer found moderate success with owners like Elmo Langley and finished third in overall points behind champion Ned Jarrett and Dick Hutcherson. Continuing his method of running with many teams in a season, Dieringer found success with Moore, Petty, Buck Baker, Junior Johnson and a surprising race win in Reid Shaw's No. 0 car in 1966. Dieringer's biggest triumph was that year, as he claimed the Southern 500 with the only other car on the lead lap being Richard Petty. Dieringer continued a dominating part-time schedule with Johnson in 1967, leading every lap form the pole at North Wilkesboro Speedway. He also ran three races for former driver Cotton Owens. Past the peak of his career by 1968, Dieringer ran part-time with former crew chief Mario Rossi and his Plymouth team, scoring no wins and only one pole. He ran one race with Rossi in 1969, then retired for a while. He came back to run superspeedway races in 1975 and attempted one race in 1976 until he entered into a phase of permanent retirement.

The character was played by Clayton Norcross from the show's premiere in 1987 until 1989, by Jeff Trachta from 1989 until 1996 and Winsor Harmon from 1996 to 2016. In September 2017, Harmon announced that the role of Thorne was to be recast, and several days after, it was announced that daytime veteran Ingo Rademacher had been cast in the role; he made his first appearance on November 27, 2017. Rademacher departed the role in February 2019. Character creation and casting Actor Clayton Nocross debuted in the role of Thorne in the serial's premiere episode on March 23, 1987. He remained in the role until 1989, when he was recast with Jeff Trachta. In 1996, Trachta was let go from the role and was recast with former All My Children actor Winsor Harmon. In May 2010, it was announced that Harmon had been downgraded to a recurring capacity, following a \\"mutual decision\\" between Harmon and the higher ups at The Bold and the Beautiful. On September 23, 2017, Harmon announced that executive producer Bradley Bell intended to recast the role of Thorne. Two days later, TV Insider's Michael Logan announced that former General Hospital actor Ingo Rademacher had been cast in the role of Thorne; he made his first appearance on November 27, 2017. On his exit, Harmon stated: \\"It shocked me, especially since [Executive Producer Brad Bell] had called said, 'I want you to come to the fan club event [in August].' I was told there was a storyline coming and then [a month later], I got the call from him that he was going to recast the role. So yeah, it was a bit of a shocker, I have to say.\\" On December 22, 2018, Rademacher announced he had opted to not extend his deal and announced his imminent exit from the role. Storylines Thorne Forrester is the younger ‚Äì and only biological ‚Äì son of Eric and Stephanie Forrester. Thorne was raised in Beverly Hills with his siblings, Ridge, Kristen, and Felicia Forrester. Thorne grew up in the shadow of big brother Ridge. Thorne had a crush on Caroline Spencer, even though she was engaged to Ridge. When Caroline dumped Ridge for having a one-night stand before their wedding, Thorne befriended Caroline, and the friendship turned to romance. But Thorne knew Caroline still loved Ridge, so he convinced Ridge's new girlfriend, Brooke Logan, to hide a letter in which Ridge professed his devotion to Caroline. Thorne and Caroline married soon after, although Caroline was furious when she learned of Thorne's part in hiding the letter. Caroline had too much to drink at a party, and Ridge thought it would be funny to slip into Caroline's bed. But Caroline, thinking Ridge was Thorne, made love to Ridge. Afterwards, Thorne was frustrated by Caroline's hesitancy to be intimate with him. While recovering from an appendectomy, Thorne overheard Eric and Stephanie discussing Ridge's prank. Drinking heavily while on painkillers, Thorne grabbed Stephanie's gun and shot Ridge in the head. Thorne passed out, so Stephanie wiped Thorne's fingerprints from the gun and told the police she had shot Ridge, thinking he was a prowler. Neither Thorne nor Ridge had any memory of what had happened that night. Thorne's family worked overtime to keep Thorne from remembering what he had done, fearing a repeat episode. Caroline, who wanted Ridge back, took Thorne to a therapist under the guise of getting marriage counseling, and soon Thorne was strong enough to grant Caroline a divorce. When Thorne finally learned of Ridge's prank, Thorne cut both Ridge and Caroline out of his life and turned an eye toward Brooke's sister, Donna Logan. Thorne had grown up thinking his youngest sister, Angela, was dead, but Stephanie was caring for a comatose Angela on the sly. No one knew that Angela's doctor had replaced Angela, who had died, with an imposter to bilk money out of the Forresters. \\"Angela\\" was severely burned escaping with the doctor, and later introduced herself to Thorne as Deveney Dickson. Thorne's empathy and offer of plastic surgery softened \\"Deveney\\", who fell in love with Thorne, but \\"Deveney\\" still went through with drugging Thorne and giving him a gun to shoot Ridge. Thorne responded when Ridge talked him down, and Angela got away with the money Thorne had given her for the surgery. Thorne met Macy Alexander when her mother, Sally Spectra, meant to lock Macy and Ridge in a room on the Queen Mary during a fashion show. Thorne briefly dated Macy and Donna Logan at the same time, but ultimately Thorne chose Macy. The Forresters and the Spectras were fashion rivals, and neither family approved of Thorne and Macy's relationship. Thorne and Macy married anyway, but separated when the strain of the families' battle became too much. During the separation, Macy dated Jake Maclaine, while Thorne got close to Karen Spencer, Caroline's long-lost identical twin sister. Just as Thorne asked Karen to move in with him, Macy asked for a reconciliation, and the three ended up living under the same roof. Macy and Karen got into a food fight over Thorne, who couldn't choose between them. Thorne finally decided on Macy, but misinterpreted Macy's goodbye hug with Jake, prompting Thorne to settle for Karen. Thorne and Macy's attempts at communication were thwarted by Karen and her father, Bill Spencer, Sr., as well as Sly Donovan, who capitalized on Macy's growing drinking problem by getting her drunk to keep her from meeting with Thorne. Karen left Thorne after she realized that Thorne still loved Macy. Thorne found Macy passed out in an alley, after which they cleared up their misunderstandings and reconciled. Thorne refused to support Eric's marriage to Sheila Carter, so Sheila spiked Macy's orange juice. When Anthony Armando, who was designing for Spectra, took Macy home and put her to bed, Thorne walked in and punched Anthony. Macy explained that Spectra needed Anthony and refused to fire him, so Thorne left Macy again. Brooke interfered with Ridge's marriage to Taylor Hayes by arranging an overseas business trip with Ridge, so Thorne punched Ridge at the airport and travelled to Paris with Brooke instead. Thorne returned for Taylor's funeral, and re-established a friendship with Macy, though he briefly dated Forrester model Ivana Vanderveld. Thorne and Macy began singing together and were signed by Decadent Records. Ivana was jealous when Thorne and Macy performed together in Rotterdam, Holland. But Macy collapsed after the show and was diagnosed with throat cancer. Thorne gave up singing and proposed to Macy after she recovered from her surgery. Ivana retaliated by sending Macy one nasty fan letter, but the letters kept coming and became increasingly threatening. Thorne fought with Ivana when the police found stationery in her apartment, and soon after, Ivana was murdered with Thorne's letter opener. Thorne was arrested during his wedding to Macy. Anthony had framed Thorne because he wanted Macy for himself. He had proposed to Ivana, then played the devastated fianc√© to gain Macy's sympathy. Thorne found out Anthony had stationery like Ivana's and broke out of prison to protect Macy, who had gone to Mexico to comfort Anthony. Thorne extracted a confession from Anthony, which Macy overheard. Thorne was recaptured, while Macy pretended to believe in Anthony's innocence. Macy tried to goad Anthony into confessing on tape but was discovered, and Sally was shot in the ensuing mel√©e. Thorne and Macy finally remarried after Anthony was apprehended. Thorne performed Grease on Broadway for four months. Upon his return, Thorne befriended Claudia Cortez. Claudia had come to the U.S. for political asylum but was in the country illegally. Thorne gave Claudia a job at Forrester anyway, and Claudia fell for Thorne. When Macy caught Claudia giving Thorne a massage, Macy reported Claudia to immigration, which drove a wedge between Macy and Thorne. Meanwhile, Thorne began to see the back-from- the-dead Taylor in a new light. After Macy divorced Thorne, Claudia and Thorne almost made love, but Claudia shied away when she realized the depth of Thorne's feelings for Taylor. Despondent over Ridge, Taylor got drunk and set her nightgown on fire with a lantern. Thorne saved Taylor and stood by her as she recovered from her burns. While Ridge was in jail for shooting Grant Chambers, Thorne convinced Taylor to lie that Ridge's baby was Thorne's and even proposed to Taylor in Hawaii. But soon Taylor wanted to tell Ridge the truth, so Thorne again worked with Brooke to prevent it. Thorne even sedated Taylor with a drugged protein shake when Ridge came to visit. Finally, Thorne relented and agreed to help Taylor stop Ridge and Brooke's wedding, but Taylor went into labor in Thorne's car, forcing Thorne to deliver baby Thomas himself. Ridge finally found out he was Thomas' father and reunited with Taylor, leaving Thorne in the cold, especially since Macy had just married Grant. Thorne moved in next door to the newlyweds, and Macy was jealous when she saw her best friend, Darla Einstein, making a move on Thorne. Grant was diagnosed with untreatable testicular cancer and wanted Thorne to fulfill Macy's desire to have a family. Thorne shocked Macy by kissing her as Grant lay dying in his hospital bed. After Grant died, Macy would only accept Thorne's friendship. Thorne, who had quit Forrester Creations over Stephanie's preferential treatment of Ridge, stepped in and saved Spectra Fashions from bankruptcy. When Macy hedged about accepting Thorne's proposal because of the Forrester/Spectra feud, Thorne connected with Brooke. Macy saw Brooke hiding under Thorne's bed and told Stephanie. Thorne arrived at the Big Bear cabin to find Stephanie terrorizing Brooke and saved Brooke from being stabbed by Stephanie . Later, Stephanie had a stroke and didn't remember finding Thorne with Brooke together, so Thorne and Brooke kept their continuing relationship a secret to prevent Stephanie from having another episode. Thorne was conflicted and even dreamt that his relationship with Brooke had killed Stephanie. Thorne reconciled with an unsuspecting Macy to throw Stephanie off the scent, narrowly avoiding a surprise wedding to Macy that Stephanie had arranged. Eric, Ridge, and Taylor plotted to convince Thorne that Brooke still loved Ridge. While in Venice, Italy, Ridge staged a fight with Taylor and then made a move on Brooke. Thorne was devastated to see Brooke kissing Ridge. Thorne followed Macy to the airport, and married her in Amsterdam. Macy was blissfully unaware that Thorne still thought of Brooke, who was trying to lure Thorne back. Macy overheard Eric and Ridge discussing Thorne's feelings for Brooke and started drinking again. A sober Macy asked Thorne, who wanted a divorce, to come to Big Bear for a last dance before ending their marriage. After Thorne left, Brooke confronted Macy with divorce papers. Macy tried to drive off, but Brooke jumped in the car with her. Macy drove recklessly to frighten Brooke and collided with a tanker. Thorne arrived and saved Brooke, but before he could get to Macy, the car exploded. At Macy's funeral, Sally exposed Thorne's continuing relationship with Brooke, causing Stephanie to have another stroke. When Stephanie forced Thorne to choose between Brooke and his family, Thorne chose Brooke, and Stephanie disowned him. Macy's half- sister, Kimberly Fairchild, decided she wanted Thorne, and set about seducing him away from Brooke. Meanwhile, Brooke's children, Rick and Bridget, were against Brooke's relationship with Thorne. Kimberly kissed Thorne backstage at a fashion show, and Bridget raised the curtain so the public would see. Brooke broke things off, and Kimberly took advantage of an inebriated Thorne by lying that they'd had sex. Kimberly also tried to kill Brooke by rigging a heavy photography light to fall on her; Thorne was almost hit when a second light dropped. Thorne and Brooke reconciled and married at the Forrester mansion, even managing to get last-minute support from the family. Thorne's happiness was short-lived when he overheard Brooke telling Deacon Sharpe that Ridge would always be her soul mate. Thorne had a vision of Macy, and, feeling he had made a terrible mistake with Brooke, Thorne asked Brooke for an annulment. Later, after Taylor was again presumed dead, Thorne shared a few quick kisses with grief counselor Tricia Quick. Ridge had defected to Spectra and challenged Forrester to a fashion showdown in Portofino, Italy. Thorne chased Lena, a woman that reminded him of Macy. But \\"Lena\\" really was Macy: Adam Alexander, Macy's father, had saved Macy before her car exploded. Adam's connections to the mob had made it necessary to take Macy on the run, and Thorne was dismayed when Macy insisted on staying in Italy and marrying her fianc√©, Lorenzo Barelli. When Sally had a heart attack, Macy returned to Los Angeles, where Thorne informed Macy they were still married because she had never signed their divorce papers. Macy's marriage to Lorenzo was invalid, leading Thorne and Macy to again reconcile. Like with Jake years earlier, Thorne mistook Macy's goodbye to Lorenzo. Thorne got drunk and made love to Darla, thinking she was Macy. Thorne and Macy squared things, but now Darla was carrying Thorne's child and wanted an abortion. After Macy had a recurrence of cancer that required her to have a hysterectomy, Thorne asked Darla to let him and Macy raise Darla's child. Darla agreed if Thorne would tell Macy he was its father, after which Macy shunned Darla and asked Thorne for an annulment. Thorne drew closer to Darla during her pregnancy. On the night Macy headlined a new club, she made peace with Thorne and Darla. Thorne and the horrified clubgoers watched helplessly as a chandelier crashed down on Macy, who went into a coma. Sally was forced to pull the plug on Macy, and Darla named her child Alexandria in tribute to Macy's memory. Darla supported Thorne as he asked to be made president of Forrester Creations, and soon Thorne and Darla were married. Ridge initially supported Thorne's presidency, but soon challenged Thorne's authority and insulted Darla. Thorne punched Ridge, then attempted a truce. But Darla mistakenly handed Sally photos of the Forrester Ingenue line, which Sally rushed into production. Thorne forgave Darla, but when Ridge banned Darla from the building, the brothers fought and demanded that Eric decide who should leave. Eric chose Ridge, and Thorne raged that he was the only true Forrester son, as it had been revealed that Massimo Marone was really Ridge's father. Thorne threw a chair through a window and told his family they would regret their choice. Sally made Thorne acting president of Spectra, where Thorne used Forrester's client list to gain support. Thorne also stole Forrester designs to use in a Spectra fashion show. But eventually, Thorne had original Spectra couture created by Spectra mainstay Clarke Garrison, former designer Amber Moore, and Thorne's sister, Felicia. Thorne challenged Forrester to a fashion showdown with Spectra. Thorne lost the competition, but gained Eric's respect. Ridge overheard Eric call Thorne his \\"only son\\" and tried to stop Spectra's line from being stocked alongside Forrester in boutiques. Thorne sold his Forrester shares and invested the money in Spectra. But when Spectra lost another fashion showdown featuring Thomas' designs, Thorne lost his investment. Stephanie discovered she was the sole owner of Forrester and offered Thorne his presidency back. Sally fell ill and lied she was going on a cruise when she was really moving to a retirement home, so Thorne and Darla moved Sally in with them. Thorne also gave Sally a job at Forrester, since Spectra was now owned by Marone Industries. The night of Alexandria's birthday party, Taylor's daughter, Phoebe Forrester, had a flat tire on a foggy highway, so Darla raced off to help. But Darla fell into the path of an oncoming car and died. Thorne was devastated, and asked for Taylor's psychiatric expertise to help explain things to Alexandria. Thorne and Taylor became close and fell in love. But Taylor had a secret: Taylor had driven drunk while also coming to help Phoebe, and was the one who had hit Darla. Phoebe and Stephanie were afraid Taylor would go to jail, and begged Taylor to keep quiet. However, when Thorne proposed to Taylor, Thorne was horrified to hear that Taylor was responsible for Darla's death. Thorne felt betrayed by Taylor, Stephanie, and Phoebe for keeping the circumstances of Darla's death from him. Taylor was arrested and pleaded guilty, but, when a witness surfaced who had seen Darla fall into the path of Taylor's car, Thorne encouraged Taylor to change her plea to not guilty, and Taylor was released. Later, Nick Marone took control of Forrester Creations, and Thorne and Ridge pulled together to help Eric create a new company, Forrester Originals. Meanwhile, Thorne and Taylor moved ahead with their plans to marry, but when Alexandria found out Taylor had killed Darla, Alexandria blacked out Taylor's pictures with crayon and slashed Taylor's wedding dress. Thorne and Taylor called off their engagement, realizing Alexandria wasn't ready to see them married. Thorne became despondent and again turned to alcohol in his grief over Darla. Thorne reconnected with Donna, seeing Darla's face as they made love. Thorne soon asked Donna to marry him, unaware that Donna was only using Thorne to get back at Stephanie for constantly hurting Brooke. On Thorne's wedding day, Donna's other sister, Katie, overheard Donna admitting she didn't love Thorne. When Katie told Thorne what she'd heard, Thorne cancelled the ceremony. Thorne was unhappy when Donna moved on to Eric, and briefly found himself bonding with Katie, although a romance never developed. When Eric planned to announce his relationship with Donna at a fashion show, Thorne and Felicia locked Donna in the Forrester steam room to keep her from taking the stage. Thorne and his family fought Eric on his decision to give Donna a position in the company. Later, when Eric fell into a coma, Donna temporarily fired Thorne and his siblings. Thorne knew that Donna was spending time with Owen Knight, so when Eric recovered, Thorne hired Donna and Owen lookalikes to kiss for a hidden camera so Eric would divorce Donna. Thorne's scheme failed. Thorne was suspected of giving Forrester designs to Jackie M after he made noise about Rick and Ridge getting too much attention at Forrester, but the real culprit was Rick. Thorne expected to take the president position when Rick stepped down, but felt even more underappreciated when Brooke made Rick president instead. Thorne and Felicia, feeling Forrester was overrun with Logans, resigned from Forrester when Brooke, Donna, and Katie became models for the Royalty line. Thorne eventually returned, but soon Bill Spencer, Jr. took control of Forrester and installed his new wife, Katie, as CEO. Katie offered Thorne the vice presidency, but Thorne refused, and Donna was given the position. Thorne joined his family in creating the ugly Dare line in an unsuccessful attempt to sabotage Bill. Thorne was upset when Steffy Forrester got the company back from Bill, but divided the stock between Ridge, Eric, Stephanie, and Taylor, while Thorne got none. Liam Cooper came to town looking for his long-lost father. It turned out both Thorne and Bill had dated Kelly Cooper, Liam's late mother. Thorne submitted to a DNA test, which showed that Bill was Liam's father. Later, when Thomas developed a crush on Brooke, Thorne pointed out that Thomas didn't have much experience with women and wondered if Thomas was gay. Ridge returned to Taylor when he thought Brooke had slept with Thomas, but, at the wedding, Stephanie admitted she'd gotten Thomas to lie in exchange for her 25% stock. Thorne growled to Eric, saying he was all right being banished in the basement with no stock because he \\"didn't want to have to spend that much time around you people\\". Thorne came to Taylor, who had also been hurt by Thomas' lie, and pointed out that Taylor and her children now controlled 55% of Forrester since Stephanie had made Taylor the trustee of Thomas' stock. When Thorne and Taylor realized they could take over the company, they kissed, reigniting their romance. Thorne made a power play at Forrester, but lost Taylor's support when she realized a takeover would put her children against their father. Thorne and Taylor later made up, with their continuing romance happening primarily off-screen, which has ended due to Taylor's relationship with Eric Forrester. Most recently, Thorne and Thomas strongly disagreed with Eric's decision to make Rick president of Forrester Creations. Thorne's daughter Alexandria Forrester has returned and is working at Forrester Creations with Hope Logan. On January 6, 2014, Ridge and Aly revealed to Rick that Thorne has taken over Ridge's former position as head of Forrester International. Thorne has returned several times a year as follows; after the helicopter crash of his brother Ridge, and late with Taylor, revealing to his relatives that he had started a new relationship with her. This caused Aly much anger and anxiety, but was resolved with conversations with Oliver and Thorne. Aly eventually found it okay because it makes Thorne happy until May 2015 when she announced to Oliver Jones that she was still quite angry at her. Thorne appeared for a few episodes in and around the death of his daughter Aly in July 2015 and then in September 2016 in an attempt to stop Eric and Quinn's wedding. In 2018, Katie Logan begins dating Thorne, her sister Brooke's ex-husband and brother of her own former fianc√©, Ridge. Thorne convinces Katie to go after full custody of her son with Bill, given that Bill had neglected to spend time with little Will as of late. To secure Katie's chances, Thorne and Katie get married. Full custody is awarded to Katie, but acrimony between the Forrester brothers and Bill ensues. A fight breaks out between Bill, Ridge, and Thorne; Bill ended up falling over his house's balcony and was then in a coma.

The hamlet of Chichester, New York, is not to be confused with the city in West Sussex, England. One difference is that unlike the city of Chichester, England, the \\"i\\" in Chichester, New York, is pronounced like \\"eye\\" instead of a vowel sound such as in the word \\"chip\\". History The hamlet was founded in 1863, by brothers Frank and Lemuel Chichester, whom the town is named after. The Chichester brothers were the sons of Samuel Chichester, the contractor who built the Catskill Mountain House. They were looking for a good location to construct a furniture factory. When they found the right place, the workers at the factory began moving in the area surrounding the factory, therefore founding the company-owned hamlet of Chichester. The narrow gauge Stony Clove and Catskill Mountain Railroad (which would later become a branch of the Ulster and Delaware Railroad) was built through the town in 1881. As was customary in that time, workers were often paid with company scrip which could be redeemed in the factory-owned general store. The factory was later purchased by William O. Schwartzwaelder, who was of German ancestry, and renamed the factory after him. The rest of the hamlet was starting to expand, all of the houses and buildings being built by the factory, as were the other buildings. There was one general store in the town, and sold such merchandise as saddles, animal feed, and hardware. There was also a post office and a schoolhouse in the town, the schoolhouse being a house at present. The furniture factory went out of business decades later in 1939, a few years after the great depression, which devastated the business. The village, at the time comprising 44 houses and buildings, was put up for auction on October 28, 1939. Joseph Day was the auctioneer. The houses and building of hamlet were purchased at the auction, and it has been in the hands of private owners ever since the auction. Geography Chichester is within the Catskill Park, and is situated in a mountainous valley. The northern portion of the hamlet borders Greene County, New York, directly south of the hamlet of Lanesville, New York. There are two major creeks that run through the hamlet. These are the Stony Clove Creek, which starts at Notch Lake in Edgewood, New York, and Warner's Creek, which also starts in Edgewood. The two creeks there, however, are called by the locals Stony Clove and Ox Clove.

The court consists of the president and the attorney-general, ten vice-presidents, sixty five areopagites and seventeen deputy attorneys-general. The members of the Supreme Court are tenured until they reach the mandatory retirement age of 67, as mandated by the Greek constitution. History The Areios Pagos is named after the first court of androfonies (crimes of murder), founded between 1500-1300 BC by Theseus and King Cecrops, which was situated on the rocky hill named after the god Ares in Athens. This highest court of antiquity was named the Areios Pagos Parliament and consisted of members for life, the Areopagites. In 462 BC a great part of the administrative and judicial powers was conveyed to the Heliaia, the 'Parliament' and the Ekklesia (public assembly). The institution was copied in many Greek city-states, and survived until well into the late Roman period, when the cities' internal autonomy was curtailed. On 16 October 1834, the Areios Pagos was founded as the supreme court of independent Greece by royal decree. Instead of receiving the name Court of Cassation, it was named after its ancient equivalent. The first supreme court justices were nominated on 13 January 1835 by royal decree. The first president of the supreme court was Christodoulos Klonaris (1788-1849), attorney at law in the city of Nafplion and the minister of justice in the government of Ioannis Kapodistrias. The first attorney-general was Andronikos Paekos, who until then was the presiding judge of the temporary court of Missolonghi. Among the areopagites there was also Anastasios Polyzoidis, until then presiding judge of the temporary court of Nafplion, famous for his refusal, along with fellow judge Georgios Tertsetis, to sign the conviction of the hero of the Greek Revolution, Theodoros Kolokotronis. The first case of the Supreme Court (1/1835) was heard on 30 April 1835 and the decision was published on 1 May 1835. The Supreme Civil and Criminal Court of Greece is currently housed in the courthouse of Leoforos Aleksandras built by renowned architect Iason Rizos (ŒôŒ¨œÉœâŒΩ Œ°ŒØŒ∂ŒøœÇ) on February 23, 1981.

High school career Jerry Sichting, the , point guard from Martinsville, Indiana, attended Martinsville High School. In his junior year, he led the Artesians to an IHSAA Sectional title. He had an excellent senior season, leading his school to a 21‚Äì2 record and another IHSAA Sectional title; he averaged 21 points, while shooting 53 percent from the field and 83 percent at the line in three seasons. Chosen as a 1975 Indiana All-Star, the team toured Europe and Russia. He also played football at the quarterback position, where he led his team to an undefeated 10‚Äì0 season in 1974 and earned 10 letters in basketball, football and baseball. On February 14, 2012, Sichting volunteered to be the interim coach for the Martinsville High School varsity boys' basketball team. He volunteered after head coach Timothy Wolf retired.Ex-Purdue, NBA player Sichting will coach Martinsville basketball team for rest of season College career After playing basketball at Martinsville High School under head coach Sam Alford, Jerry attended Purdue University, located in West Lafayette, Indiana, to play for head coach Fred Schaus. In his freshman season, Jerry boasted a 54.5 field goal and 81.6 free throw percentage. Playing under Lee Rose during his senior season and alongside All-American Joe Barry Carroll, he helped lead the Boilermakers to a Big Ten Conference title tie with the Earvin Johnson-led Michigan State team. After losing the spot to be invited to the NCAA Tournament, Sichting led the Boilers to an NIT Finals appearance, losing to in-state conference rival, Indiana. Named a First Team All-Big Ten selection his senior year, he currently holds the school career free-throw percentage record with a .867 accuracy. He also left Purdue with the school record for consecutive free throws made with 34, which was broken three decades later by Robbie Hummel's 36. Professional career =Indiana Pacers= Sichting was selected in the fourth round of the 1979 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors, although he did not play a game for the Warriors; after being waived, he spent time as a member of the CBA's Maine Lumberjacks. He was signed for the 1980‚Äì81 NBA season by the Indiana Pacers, after completing their free-agent training camp; he spent five seasons with the Pacers. His best season in his career came in 1983‚Äì84, where he averaged 11.5 points, 2.1 rebounds, and 5.7 assists a game, while holding a .532 field goal percentage. =Boston Celtics= After five seasons with the Pacers, Sichting was traded to the Boston Celtics to start the 1985‚Äì86 season. Sichting and fellow Indiana native Larry Bird were the only two Celtics players that season to play in all 82 games. Jerry became a role player off the bench for the Celtics' 1986 NBA championship team. He is known for being involved in a fight with Houston Rockets center Ralph Sampson during Game 5 of the 1986 NBA Finals, resulting in Sampson's ejection. =Portland Trail Blazers, Charlotte Hornets, Milwaukee Bucks= Sichting played on the Portland Trail Blazers during the 1988‚Äì89 season and then was traded to the Charlotte Hornets for his last full season. He retired in 1990 after playing one game with the Milwaukee Bucks. Broadcasting career After Sichting retired, he returned to Boston, Massachusetts, where he ran his Jerry Sichting Basketball Camp for five years and served as a Boston Celtics analyst on radio broadcasts. He also did broadcasts for pregame shows for his alma mater, Purdue University, and various Indiana high school games as well as a fill-in for Bobby Leonard on the Pacers' television broadcasts alongside Jerry Baker. Coaching career =Minnesota Timberwolves= In 1995, Sichting became the Minnesota Timberwolves' director of scouting and development. During that year he also became an assistant on the Wolves' bench, a position he held until the 2004‚Äì05 season. He returned to Minnesota as an assistant once again under head coach and former Celtics teammate Kevin McHale for the 2008‚Äì09 and 2009‚Äì10 seasons. =Marquette= Jerry Sichting served as an assistant coach at Marquette University, located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

It is a nucleoside analogue which exhibits low toxicity and good selectivity. Because penciclovir is absorbed poorly when given orally (by mouth) it is more often used as a topical treatment. It is the active ingredient in the cold sore medications Denavir (NDC 0135-0315-52), Vectavir and Fenivir. Famciclovir is a prodrug of penciclovir with improved oral bioavailability. Penciclovir was approved for medical use in 1996.

Mechanism of action Penciclovir is inactive in its initial form. Within a virally infected cell a viral thymidine kinase adds a phosphate group to the penciclovir molecule; this is the rate-limiting step in the activation of penciclovir. Cellular (human) kinases then add two more phosphate groups, producing the active penciclovir triphosphate. This activated form inhibits viral DNA polymerase, thus impairing the ability of the virus to replicate within the cell. The selectivity of penciclovir may be attributed to two factors. First, cellular thymidine kinases phosphorylate the parent form significantly less rapidly than does the viral thymidine kinase, so the active triphosphate is present at much higher concentrations in virally infected cells than in uninfected cells. Second, the activated drug binds to viral DNA polymerase with a much higher affinity than to human DNA polymerases. As a result, penciclovir exhibits negligible cytotoxicity to healthy cells. The structure and mode of action of penciclovir are very similar to that of other nucleoside analogues, such as the more widely used aciclovir. A difference between aciclovir and penciclovir is that the active triphosphate form of penciclovir persists within the cell for a much longer time than the activated form of aciclovir, so the concentration within the cell of penciclovir will be higher given equivalent cellular doses.

The term was in use in the United Kingdom from at least the 18th century to the mid-20th century but it is now archaic. The role was related to the position of lady-in-waiting, which by the 19th century was only applied to the female retainers of female members of the royal family. Ladies- in-waiting were usually women from the most privileged backgrounds who took the position for the prestige of associating with royalty, or for the enhanced marriage prospects available to those who spent time at court, but lady's companions usually took up their occupation because they needed to earn a living and have somewhere to live. A companion is not to be confused with lady's maid, a female personal attendant roughly equivalent to a \\"gentleman's gentleman\\" or valet. Status and duties Like a governess, a lady's companion was not regarded as a servant, but neither was she really treated as an equal; however her position in the household of her employer was notably less awkward and solitary than that of a governess. Only women from a class background similar to or only a little below that of their employer would be considered for the position. Women took positions as companions if they had no other means of support, as until the late 19th century there were very few other ways in which an upper- or upper-middle-class woman could earn a living which did not result in a complete loss of her class status. (Employment as a governess, running a private girls' school and writing were virtually the only other such options; hence the formation of the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women in 1859.) The companion's role was to spend her time with her employer, providing company and conversation, to help her to entertain guests and often to accompany her to social events. In return she would be given a room in the family's part of the house, rather than the servants' quarters; all of her meals would be provided, and she would eat with her employer; and she would be paid a small salary, which would be called an \\"allowance\\" ‚Äì never \\"wages\\". She would not be expected to perform any domestic duties which her employer might not carry out herself, in other words little other than giving directions to servants, fancy sewing and pouring tea. Thus the role was not very different from that of an adult relation in respect of the lady of a household, except for the essential subservience resulting from financial dependency. Lady's companions were employed because upper- and middle-class women spent most of their time at home. A lady's companion might be taken on by an unmarried woman living on her own, by a widow, a married woman who lived with her husband and sons but had no daughters and desired female company, or by an unmarried woman who was living with her father or another male relation but had lost her mother, and was too old to have a governess. In the latter case the companion would also act as a chaperone; at the time, it would not have been socially acceptable for a young lady to receive male visitors without either a male relation or an older lady present (a female servant would not have sufficed). End of the lady's companion The occupation of lady's companion has been made obsolete in the United Kingdom and most other developed countries. This is primarily because upper- class women no longer primarily stay in the home, and also because of the many other employment opportunities afforded to modern women. Historical examples *Mary Wollstonecraft served as companion to a wealthy widow, Sarah Dawson, in the spa town of Bath. It was her first job, aged 19 in 1778. In fiction =In the works of Agatha Christie= There are numerous lady's companions in the mysteries of Agatha Christie, e.g. After the Funeral. In her novels dating before the Second World War, the companion is presented as a conventional feature of the life of the moneyed classes. However, it is after the Second World War that desperation begins to creep in. The companions after the Second World War are generally elderly women who grew up in Victorian times without the expectation of having to provide for themselves, but who find themselves impoverished due to the decline of the fortunes of many once well-to-do families as a result of the Great Depression and the investment losses incurred during the War. At the same time, the women who employ them are often not so well off as they once were themselves, especially in net terms due to high rates of property taxation. This situation is complicated by the collapse in the supply of working-class servants due to changing labour market conditions and social attitudes, so that companions are increasingly asked to perform domestic duties which they find humiliating, especially since they at one point had servants waiting on them. Along with the growing keenness of young middle-class women to take advantage of the broadening range of options available to them to have a career, this degradation of the status of the companion represents the closure of the era of the lady's companion in the United Kingdom. A notable companion, Miss Gilchrist appears in the aforementioned After the Funeral. After drugging and murdering her employer to steal a valuable artwork, she disguises herself as the dead woman to attend a funeral, in order to turn the family against each other. =Other examples= *In Vanity Fair (novel), the protagonist Becky Sharp hires Miss Briggs as a companion she describes as a sheepdog, thus allowing her husband to leave her with propriety in the company of other men with whom she is flirting. *Heidi, in the eponymous children's fiction book, is taken from her Swiss mountain home at the age of eight to become the companion of an invalid girl in Frankfurt, Germany. *The unnamed narrator of Rebecca is a lady's companion as the novel begins. *Miss Taylor, one of the first characters met in Jane Austen's novel Emma, lives with the Woodhouses \\"less as a governess than a friend\\" to her grown-up charge. *Josephine March (and later, her youngest sister Amy) is a companion to her wealthy great-aunt in Louisa May Alcott's novel Little Women. *Sarah Woodruff works as a companion in John Fowles's The French Lieutenant's Woman. *Dorothy \\"Dot\\" Williams is Phryne Fisher's companion in Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries.

She also assumed a leading role in psychology both nationally as well as internationally. In addition to performing seminal social psychology research, Wood Sherif devoted herself to teaching her students and was recognized for her efforts with an American Psychological Association award named in her honor that is presented annually.  Early and personal life  She was born Carolyn Wood on 26 June 1922, the youngest of three children of Bonny Williams and Lawrence Anselm Wood, in Loogootee, Indiana. In 1945, she married a fellow psychologist, Muzafer Sherif, with whom she had three children: Sue, Joan, and Ann Sherif.  Death  In July 1982, Carolyn Wood Sherif died of cancer at age 60 in State College, Pennsylvania.  Education  Wood Sherif graduated from West Lafayette High School in 1940. = Undergraduate = Wood Sherif earned a Bachelor of Science from Purdue University in 1943 with the highest distinction in an experimental program developed for women science majors that focused on studying the sciences within humanist and historical perspectives. While Wood Sherif took classes in the sciences and mathematics, she had little exposure to psychology during her undergraduate studies.Vegega, M. E., & Signorella, M. L. (1990). \\"Carolyn Wood Sherif (1922-1982).\\" In A. N. O‚ÄôConnell & N. F. Russo (Eds.), Women in psychology: A bio-bibliographic sourcebook (pp. 297‚Äì306). New York: Greenwood Press. Instead, Wood Sherif later wrote that several experiences together inspired her to pursue a career in social psychology. First, the United States Department of the Treasury distributed a play she wrote in Junior year to community programs encouraging the sale of war bonds, prompting Wood Sherif to wonder about the ways her play would affect its audiences. She received encouragement from a professor to pursue these questions through research in the field of social psychology. Secondly, inspiration to study social psychology came in part from her amazement at the sudden shift in the American public's attitude from isolationism to support for World War II (Indeed, this amazement led her to investigate attitudes throughout her career as a central topic in her research.) Lastly, she also had a strong desire to better the world, and because of these experiences, she decided to pursue a career in social psychology in order to accomplish this goal. = Graduate = With this goal in mind, Wood Sherif went on to obtain a master's degree from the University of Iowa in 1944 in social psychology under Wendell Johnson where she performed her first research on attitudinal constructs and also worked with Leon Yarrow to investigate how people respond to perspectives that are counter to their own. While working on her master's thesis examining how racially biased attitudes affect serial recall in a laboratory task, Wood Sherif read The Psychology of Social Norms (1936), written by Muzafer Sherif. This book had a profound effect on her as she saw many of her own scientific interests reflected in its chapters. She announced to her peers and professors that Sherif was \\"the kind of social psychologist that I [Carolyn] want to be.\\" In 1944, following the completion of her master's, Wood Sherif went to work as a psychology researcher for Audience Research Inc., at Princeton. After a short employment, Wood Sherif left the survey research field (she quickly became dissatisfied with the research she was asked to perform analyzing data on potential Hollywood movies). She decided instead to return to graduate studies, and applied for a research assistant position with Muzafer Sherif at Princeton University, which initiated their career-long professional collaboration. In addition to a productive work relationship, Carolyn and Muzafer developed a personal relationship that culminated in their marriage in December 1945. Carolyn and Muzafer faced special difficulties in their marriage. In addition to the normal stressors of married life, they came from drastically different backgrounds (Muzafer was raised in Turkey) and were in different stages in their professional lives. However, Sherif had decided that she wanted to have a marriage of equals where her career ambitions would be supported. She characterizes this as a desire based on fictional portrayals and not reflected in the reality of any of the relationships she observed. When she met Sherif, Carolyn Wood felt that she had found a way to achieve her dream. Muzafer Sherif was an outspoken believer in equal rights for women and fully supported Wood Sherif's goal of realizing a successful research career. However, because Princeton (where Muzafer was then working) did not accept women as graduate students until 1961, Wood Sherif commuted to Columbia University for classes for graduate education. Wood Sherif also actively engaged in conducting research and writing books with Sherif during this period, but she was frequently denied appropriate credit for her work because she did not have a PhD or a position at any university. When their joint work was solely attributed to Muzafer, Sherif notes that Muzafer's indignant reaction to this injustice, equal to her own, helped temper the blow. In an attempt to remedy this situation, after the births of the three Sherif children, Wood Sherif returned to graduate school as a full-time student at the University of Texas in 1958. In 1961, Wood Sherif completed her PhD under Wayne Holtzman at this university. Her dissertation culminated in the published paper \\"Social Categorization as a function of Latitude of Acceptance and Series Range\\", which assessed the different ranges of positions on a topic that different individuals found acceptable, examined how an individual's range of acceptability changed depending on the range of the stimuli being labeled as acceptable or not, and how these two factors in turn affected the behavior of social categorization. = Post-graduate = Between 1961 and 1965, Wood Sherif and Sherif published four books together, including the culmination of their Robber's Cave Experiment data. Wood Sherif is first author on the final of these books published in 1965, Attitude and Attitude Change: The Social Judgement-Involvement Approach, which presented the social judgment theory of persuasion. Following this highly productive period, both Wood Sherif and Sherif were offered tenure-track positions at Pennsylvania State University. Wood Sherif subsequently had visiting professor positions at Cornell University (1969-1970) and Smith College (1979-1980), but she remained a professor at Pennsylvania State University until her death in 1982. Wood Sherif also devoted herself to teaching, creating both undergraduate and graduate courses at Pennsylvania State University to address issues in social psychology. Furthermore, she was influential in the development of social psychology courses pertaining to women, creating the first women's studies course during her visiting year at Cornell University and a women and psychology course for Pennsylvania State University.  Contributions to social psychology  Wood Sherif contributed to many areas of social psychology through her own broad research interests and her encouragement to her students to study whatever topics they found most compelling, instead of solely the topics on which she had already performed research. As both a dedicated researcher and mentor, Carolyn made significant contributions to areas including leadership studies, gender identity, attitude, sports psychology, and persuasion. = Robber's Cave Experiment and realistic conflict theory = In what is now considered a classic study in social psychology, Sherif and Wood Sherif examined intergroup hostility by observing 22 eleven-year-old boys over the course of an elaborate experimental summer camp setup where the boys were divided into two arbitrary groups, put into conflict and competition, and then integrated through cooperative tasks. The Sheriffs concluded from this experiment that groups come into conflict and negative attitudes towards the outgroup arise when groups compete for limited resources that only one group may ultimately claim (e.g. prizes during summer camp competitions in the experiment). Furthermore, contact with an outgroup is insufficient to reduce the negative attitude if no other measures are taken. Instead, negative attitudes can be reduced and positive intergroup relations can occur if both groups are required to unite and cooperate in order to achieve a goal. This study provided important empirical support for the realistic conflict theory, which outlines each of these experimental conclusions as its own theoretical arguments. This study also informed scientific understanding of the origin of prejudiced attitudes that arise from group conflict and how these negative attitudes may in turn be diminished to promote intergroup harmony. Competition and sports psychology Wood Sherif later translated her expertise in group formation and competition to the emerging field of sports psychology. Her definition of \\"competition\\" as a social process based on her work with the Robber's Cave Experiment became a standard for the new field that is still cited: She also emphasized the role of motivation in competitive performance, instead of simply the ability to compete, writing that \\"the quality and persistence in competition depends upon...the significance [of the activity] to the child\\" or other competitor. She noted that the social environment could significantly affect the level of motivation an individual would have to perform in a given competitive process. In particular, she contributed a seminal article on women in sports, \\"Females and the competitive process\\" detailing the effects of the social environment on women's motivation and performance in sports. In addition to talks at several sports psychology conferences, she was invited to speak to the Scientific Congress held before the 1972 Olympic Games on this topic (as the only female speaker to present). = Social judgment theory = Wood Sherif outlined a seminal theory of attitude change in Attitude and Attitude Change (1965). In this work, Wood Sherif outlined social judgment theory, relating the involvement of the individual (the self) to situations of persuasion. She argued that audiences judge persuasive messages by the degree to which the messages agree or disagree with their own attitudes. People compare their attitudes with those of others using \\"latitudes of , rejection, and noncommitment.\\" That is, individuals have their own position on a topic, but also maintain a range, or latitude, or other related attitudes on that topic that they accept, a latitude of attitudes that they reject as inappropriate, and a latitude of attitudes that they neither support nor find objectionable. These three latitudes together characterize an individual's attitude toward any topic. Furthermore, social judgment theory states that the greater the latitude of rejection for an individual (the more positions they object to outside of their own), the more involved that person is assumed to be with that topic (i.e. the stronger their attitude towards the topic), and the harder it will be to persuade them to change their attitude.  The self- system  Additionally, Wood Sherif presented the conceptual framework of a \\"self-system,\\" an organized collection of attitudes that has been molded by an individual's interactions with the social environment (e.g. family, religious institutions). The self-system provides the organizational schema by which an individual relates parts of themselves to significant individuals, groups, or institutions in their social environment. Wood Sherif emphasized that studies of specific attitudes must account for this overarching self-system organization of attitudes when interpreting results (i.e. any attitude exists within the framework of the self-system and must be interpreted in relation to this individual's organization of attitudes). Furthermore, Wood Sherif argued that as individuals develop these organized attitudes towards the social world, their self-system alters their perception of other people's attitudes, so that similarities and differences to others' attitudes are exaggerated for an individual. This approach was important for clarifying seemingly contradictory results in attitude change research that focused only on individual attitudes. The importance of this approach to studying attitudes was noted by Shaffer and Shields in their review: This book outlining social judgment theory and the self-system concept became one of Wood Sherif's most widely recognized contributions to social psychology. = Gender identity and psychology of women = Wood Sherif was an active member in the APA, in division 35 which was dedicated to the Psychology of Women. She was the program chair for the 1978 APA program and the division President from 1979-1980. She made numerous contributions in this time through her published research articles on a variety of women's topics including: gender bias in research, gender identity, gender role, reproduction and sociology. Wood Sherif applied her concept of the self-system in pioneering research on gender identity that culminated in the publication of her other best-known book, Orientation in Social Psychology, in 1976, and her presidential address to the American Psychological Association (Division 35-Psychology of Women) as the head of that division in 1980. In these works, she states that gender is a sociological construct (a set of organized social categories) with both biological and cultural determinants. She argues that research on gender identity needs to account for the fact that individuals are aware of the gender categories within their culture and maintain a psychological relationship with this categorization; that is, their self-systems are influenced by this aspect of the social environment. So, according to Wood Sherif, psychologists need to understand the gender categories and their organization in their own culture before they can perform meaningful studies of gender identity. She further argued for the use of the self-system concept in gender identity studies instead of simply relying on a single self-report question. To truly understand a person's gender identity, she insisted that scientists needed to understand how that individual related different parts of their identity to different aspects of their social environment. This method of assessing gender identity would allow scientists to examine novel questions about cohesion and fragmentation of an individual's gender identity depending on how an individual's different social stimuli generate different attitudes about their gender. For example, a woman might be treated equally to men in her group of friends, but she might also feel her gender is inferior if she adheres to a religious institution that holds that attitude. Therefore, Wood Sherif argued that understanding an individual's reference groups, the important elements of their social environment that are a part of that person's self-system, would be crucial to understanding that person's complex gender identity and explaining their attitudes. She argued that accounting for the complexities in gender identity using this self-system approach could help explain the seemingly contradictory results obtained from studies using simple self-report measures or those that focused only on single attitudes. Gender stereotyping In addition, Wood Sherif addressed the issue of whether these gender categories inherently lead to a gender hierarchy and gender stereotyping within a culture by referencing her work on the Robber's Cave experiment. She argued that individuals could prefer their own category without necessarily holding negative attitudes towards those in another category if both groups are considered equal and must work interdependently to achieve goals (in the same way that cooperation between the two groups of boys in the experiment removed their negative attitudes towards each other). She emphasized that it is not the degree of difference or similarity between two groups that leads to negative outgroup attitudes like gender stereotyping, but instead this nature of the relationship between the two groups. She suggested that negative stereotyping of the female gender therefore occurred because of the power differential in this relationship between males and females in American society. Social power and social status Lastly, she argued that the social psychological definition of \\"social power\\" at that time, which was interpreted in terms of social persuasion abilities, did not accurately describe social power because social power and social persuasion were instead two separate concepts. A group with little social power could still be very persuasive (e.g. acting helpless to get assistance), so Wood Sherif rejected the definition that combined the two concepts. Instead, she argued that the power of the groups relative to each other had to be taken into account first without assessing persuasive abilities by instead examining relative control of resources and other people. She then argued that attitude and persuasion researchers should instead consider differences in \\"social status,\\" which she defined as the combination of social power and social position. She stated that the social status of a poor, black woman was very different from the social status of a wealthy, white woman, which in turn was very different from a wealthy white man. Therefore, she advocated that attitude and persuasion studies examine social status in terms of gender, social class, ethnic group, and family for each individual. Only after understanding this social status differential with respect to these different levels (from gender to family) did Wood Sherif believe scientists could then understand differences in social persuasion strategies between groups. = Selected publications = * An Outline of Social Psychology.

Family history  Bhai Mahi Singh belonged to the Kamboj (Mahrok) landlord family of Sunam. He had taken Amrit from Guru Gobind Singh at the time of the Vaisakhi of 1699.  General Madan Khan's raid of Anandpur  Once Guru Gobind Singh was holding his religious court at Anandpur Sahib and the melodious kirtan service was being held. A Sikh scout brought the news that General Madan Khan from Gwalior, had entered Anandpur for a showdown with the Sikhs and the Guru. Learning the news, Guru Gobind Singh announced it in the dewan (assembly) and asked for a brave man who could face and crush the pride of the haughty Madan Khan. On hearing the announcement from the Guru, Bhai Mahi Singh immediately sought his permission and blessings to empower him to defeat Madan Khan.  General Madan Khan vs Bhai Mahi Singh  Having received the permission of Guru Gobind Singh Ji, Bhai Mahi Singh rode on his swift horse and reached Madan Khan's camp and challenged him for a one-to-one fight. General Madan Khan agreed and chose to strike first to which Bhai Mahi Singh consented. Madan Khan took a full and tremendous swing of his sword at Bhai Mahi Singh which the latter stopped with his shield. Madan Khan struck again and was again stopped by Bhai Mahi Singh; and for a third time with the same result. Having been outwitted, General Madan Khan tried to play foul and therefore struck the fourth time against the rules of fair game but Bhai Mahi Singh, being alert and on his guard, took a full forceful swing of his double-edged sword at Madan Khan due to which the head of Khan got chopped off and fell on the ground rolling like a ball. The blow was so powerful that it also shattered the shield of General Madan Khan. Seeing that their chieftain was dead, the five hundred soldiers of Madan Khan returned without taking further risk to fight with the Sikhs.  Appreciation from Guru Gobind Singh  The news of the victory of Bhai Mahi Singh was broken to the congregation which received great applause from the Guru ji and the entire sangat. Later, when Guru Gobind Singh had left Anandpur and landed in Malwa, he sent for Bhai Mahi Singh to meet him at Damdama Sahib. Bhai Mahi Singh complied with the Guru's instruction and reached Damdama Sahib forthwith. Once again acknowledging the role of Bhai Mahi Singh as a warrior, the tenth Guru offered him a Hukamnama (edict) in recognition of his meritorious services to the Guru Ghar(the House of the Guru) on 15 Srawan Samvat, 1763 (1706 AD). First six lines on the Hukumnama Sahib is written by Guru Gobind Singh Ji and were elaborated further by Bhai Mani Singh Ji. The original copy of the Hukamnama is said to be still in the possession of the descendant, Jasvir Singh.  Martyrdom of Bhai Mahi Singh  Bhai Mahi Singh later died a martyr to the Sikh cause while fighting valiantly at the Battle of Chappar Chiri under the standard of Banda Bahadur, twenty kilometres from Sirhind on May 12, 1710 AD.

It was made up of eight humans - Bedlam, Carnivore, Conquest, Decay, Inferno, Juggernaut, Stonecutter, and Tempest - who were empowered by the Octessence. Fictional team history The eight powerful magical beings known as the Octessense could not agree who amongst them was the most powerful. They decided on a wager wherein each of the eight beings created an artifact which would turn the first human being that touched it into an Exemplar, a being who personified the power of that specific magical being. When all eight Exemplars were formed, they would have a Ceremony of the Octessense, where the Exemplars could battle it out, determining who was the most powerful. The first Exemplar was the Juggernaut, who had formerly been Cain Marko, stepbrother to Charles Xavier. Marko found the Crimson Ruby of Cytorrak while serving in the Korean War. Unfortunately for the Juggernaut, the Temple of Cytorrak collapsed while he was inside, and it took the Juggernaut many years to dig out. Seven other humans were transformed into Exemplars: Olisa Kabaki, Count Andreas Zorba, Brigdet Malone, Yoshiro Hachiman, Sam McGee, Utama Somchart and Nicolette Giroux. Despite all eight Exemplars coming from drastically different backgrounds, all share the key detail that they were primarily motivated by their frustration and rage at having failed to get what they wanted out of life. Although each Exemplar committed villainous acts on their own, the first action the Exemplars took as a team was to attack Spider-Man in the basement of the Daily Bugle. As a team, they also fought against Iron Man, Thor and Professor X when they attempted to recruit the Juggernaut in the construction of the 'God Machine' that they would use to take over the world. With the aid of the four gathered heroes- Iron Man and Thor holding off the rest of the Exemplars while Spider-Man tricked them into destroying a vital component of the machine and Xavier used his powers to draw out the true Juggernaut-, Juggernaut was able to destroy the machine, causing an explosion that sent the Exemplars flying all around the world while the heroes only just managed to escape. Although the Juggernaut resisted Cytorrak's evil influence (Iron Man speculated that the process that gave him his powers had been interrupted, otherwise he would have been just like the other Exemplars) and eventually switched to the side of good, the other Exemplars did not, each of them determined to continue their respective entity's vendetta against the others. Having come together after the explosion, they tracked Juggernaut to New York, declared him a traitor and captured him, planning on executing him for his crimes against the Octessense. At the last moment, Juggernaut was rescued by the combined force of the Avengers, the team currently consisting of Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Wonder Man, the Scarlet Witch, Firestar, Justice, the Wasp, and Giant-Man, while being aided by Quicksilver, Hercules, Spider-Man, and Nova. The Exemplars managed to defeat all of the heroes except for Captain America, who made Bedlam realize that she and the other Exemplars had had significant psychological alterations made by the entities that gave them their powers. Bedlam used her psychic powers to broadcast her realization to the other Exemplars, clearing their minds of the evil mystical influence, leaving their original personalities but retaining their powers (just like the Juggernaut's situation). After that, they departed until they could figure out what to do next, and haven't been seen since. The Artifacts As per the wager of the Octessence each created a relic possessing a fraction of their power causing the first mortal to touch the relics to become living embodiments of said power. The eight artifacts were: *The Blinding Brazier of Balthakk *The Crimson Gem of Cyttorak *The Fearsome Fist of Farallah *The Ivory Idol of Ikonn *The Kestrel Key of Krakkan *The Ringed Ruby of Raggadorr *The Verdant Vial of Valtorr *The Wondrous Waterfall of Watoomb Membership =Bedlam= *Bedlam (Olisa Kabaki).

She lost many of her family members in the Troubles and suffered a possible rape experience. She has suspected links to the IRA. She went on the run when she was suspected of involvement in a shootout with police. She was empowered by the Kestrel Key of Krakkan. She possessed enhanced fighting skills and a wide assortment of weaponry attached to her costume, also demonstrating an enhanced physique. Her reflexes were even fast enough to allow her to catch Quicksilver while he was in motion. She could also fire powerful bolts of energy from the kestrel key. =Decay= *Decay (Yoshiro Hachiman): He is a Japanese business efficiency expert, generally disliked for constantly firing people. He is known to have a fondness for artwork. Empowered by the Verdant Vial of Valtorr, he possessed a \\"touch of death\\" that caused both organic and inorganic objects to disintegrate (Although Thor and Hercules were immune to his powers due to their immortality). He also seemed to have some ability to levitate as well as some form of enhanced durability, likely due to his corpselike state. =Inferno= *Inferno (Samantha McGee): An American pilot from Tennessee. She used to be employed by the United States Air Force, but resented the lack of freedom she felt when under the control of her employers. She resigned, moved to Nunavut, Canada, and set up her own company McGee Charter Service. She was self-employed but the business was not lucrative. Empowered by the Blinding Brazier of Balthakk, she possessed the ability to fly and generate intense heat and flames, generally focused into powerful bolts of energy, strong enough to vaporise steel. =Juggernaut= *Juggernaut (Cain Marko): Stepbrother of Professor X and long-time foe of the X-Men; empowered by the Crimson Crystal of Cyttorak, he possessed superhuman strength and invulnerability, becoming unstoppable once in motion. =Stonecutter= *Stonecutter (Utama Somchart): An itinerant worker from Thailand.

He was empowered by the Ringed Ruby of Raggadorr, possessing enhanced strength and combat skills, as well as the ability to design and build the \\"God Machine\\" which would drain humanity of its free will. He could also develop a machine that would have drained the Juggernaut's powers (Although he noted that it would take too long to build it before the Juggernaut escaped his current captivity). He possessed the ability to design and create machines rapidly, such as energy cannons, energy restraints and the flying fortress. =Tempest= *Tempest (Nicolette Giroux): A French woman and an international game warden that was known to take her job too far. Empowered by the Wondrous Waterfall of Watoomb, she possessed the ability to manipulate nature, and demonstrated the ability to create and control plant life, manipulate the earth, and manipulate the weather, however, her most used ability was control over the winds, summoning powerful storms and becoming an insubstantial fog-like form.

It was originally formed as part of the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm for service during World War II and took part in combat operations in Norway, North Africa, Sicily and off the coast of France. Following the conclusion of hostilities, the squadron was disbanded in 1945. In 1950, it was re-raised as part of the Royal Australian Navy and subsequently took part in the Korean War. Recent deployments have included Operation Falconer, Operation Slipper and Operation Sumatra Assist. In December 2011, the squadron was disbanded. Recent roles Until its disbandment in December 2011, 817 was active as a helicopter squadron equipped with Westland Sea King Mk 50 helicopters. 817 Squadron was a land based squadron operating the Sea King helicopter in Fleet Utility Support roles, including Search and Rescue, Surveillance, and Air and ground crew training. 817 Squadron also had responsibility for maintaining and operating aircraft on the Kanimbla class, HMAS Tobruk and HMAS Success. The Squadron was based at HMAS Albatross (NAS Nowra).

Turning over Lake Burley Griffin, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory to track along Anzac Parade and over the Australian War Memorial before returning to Nowra for decommissioning. 817 Squadron was first formed as a Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm squadron in 1941, operating Fairey Albacore aircraft in the ASW role in Icelandic and Mediterranean waters. The Squadron reformed in 1943 with Fairey Barracuda aircraft and carried out operations in Sumatra and the Nicobar area before disbanding in 1945. On 25 April 1950, 817 Squadron was re- formed as a Royal Australian Navy FAA squadron operating Fairey Firefly AS6 aircraft. The Squadron embarked on HMAS Sydney and served with distinction during the Korean War, operating the Fairey Firefly Mk5. In October 1953 the squadron embarked on HMAS Vengeance. The Squadron disbanded and reformed with Fairey Gannets in 1955, operating from HMAS Melbourne and conducting Fleet ASW support and training until 1958. 817 Squadron reformed in 1963 to conduct ASW, Fleet Utility support and training, equipped with Westland Wessex HAS.31A helicopters. These were updated to Wessex HAS.31Bs in 1968, and the Squadron was re-equipped with Westland Sea King MK50 helicopters in 1976. 817 Squadron operated from HMAS Melbourne, until the aircraft carrier decommissioned in 1982 without replacement. Recent operational deployments have included UN operations in Somalia in 1993, peace keeping operations in Bougainville during 1994 (where one aircraft was hit by ground fire) and Operation Stabilise in East Timor during 1999 and 2000. 817 Squadron has also provided operational air support to the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games and support to the people of the Solomon Islands during 2000 and 2001 in Operation Trek, after the civil insurgence. The squadron was also called upon in 2003 to provide further air support in the Solomon Islands as part of Operation Anode. 817 Squadron has been heavily committed to the fight against terrorism with continuing deployments to the Persian Gulf aboard HMAS Kanimbla and HMAS Manoora. These deployments have formed an integral part of the Australian contingent of the International Coalition Against Terrorism (ICAT). During late 2001 and 2002, 817 Squadron aircraft deployed to the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Slipper to enforce UN sanctions against Iraq, and again in 2003 as part of Operation Falconer with the invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq. The Squadron also has maintained one aircraft and crew at Christmas Island for various periods to provide a surveillance capability in defence of Australia's northern borders. Most recently, 817 Squadron has provided aircraft for Operation Sumatra Assist and Operation Sumatra Assist II, which were Australia's contribution to the humanitarian effort in Indonesia as a result of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the subsequent 2005 Nias‚ÄìSimeulue earthquake. During the latter operation, one of the two Seakings (Shark 02) embarked on HMAS Kanimbla, crashed on the Island of Nias with the loss of nine personnel. The accident occurred as a result of a series of maintenance errors, specifically the incorrect re-fitting of a nut and split pin during maintenance performed on the aircraft some two months before the crash. Deficiencies in maintenance practices, training, support and logistics operations within the Navy were also identified as contributing factors. Following the accident, several major changes were made to maintenance and safety management practices at 817 Squadron. 817 Squadron was decommissioned on 16 December 2011.

Wadapally comes under the assembly constituency of Miryalaguda, this town is 24 km from Miryalaguda town. Wadapally is major producer of Cement in Nalgonda district due to the availability of limestone across the borders of Nalgonda district and neighboring Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh. Wadapally is famous for Shiva and is situated on the sangamam of River Krishna and Musi. It is accessible through bus and train from different places throughout Telangana such as Nalgonda, Suryapet, Miryalaguda, Hyderabad and from Andhra Pradesh such as Guntur, Nellore, Secunderabad, Tirupathi, Dachepalle. The two temples located in Wadapally are the Sri Meenakshi Agasteswara swami temple and Sri Lakshmi Narasimha swami temple. This town is located at the confluence of the Krishna and Musi rivers. The place is known for the temple of Sri Meenakshi Agasteswara Swamy which was constructed by the Kakatiya rulers in the 12th century. The significance of the temple is that there is a crevice on top of the Shivalinga which is always full of water. Even if some water is removed the original level of the water is maintained. There is no logical reason that can explain this phenomenon especially since the Shivalinga is situated about 120 metres above the water level in the river. Sri Narasimha Swamy is believed to bless the devotees with health and prosperity who pray to him soulfully. The sacred river Krishna has a very prominent place in the history of our country. Wadapally is the place where river Krishna and Musi River meet and jointly flow. Wadapally is near Vishnupuram of Nalgonda District in Dameracherla mandal and in between Bibinagar and Nadikudi Railway Stations. The coming together of these two rivers in the shape of \\"L\\" attract irresistibly the viewers. At the confluence of these rivers, there is a very old temple of Sri Narasimha Swamy. According to the Puranas, Vyasa Bhagavan knowing the piousness of the place, meditated for a long time for the manifestation of Sri Narasimha Swamy. Commiserating at the continued penance of Vyasa Bhagavan Lord Maha Vishnu again transfigured as Narasimha Swamy and appeared to the former, with ferocious looks of a lion. Vyasa Bhagavan experienced Lord Narasimha, who was taking breath with uncontrolled anger, coming to him just after killing Hiranyakasipu. He, therefore, entreated Sri Narasimha Swamy to manifest at Wadapally in that form only. Accordingly, Sri Narasimha Swamy manifested there to bless the devotees and to alleviate their difficulties. It is believed that even now the idol breathes in and out. The temple authorities have arranged two lamps. One of the lights of the lamp used for showing the face of the Lord will be quivering to testify the fact that the Lord is taking breath and letting it out. The light of the other lamp, which is kept below remain resolutely. There are a two mosques in vazeerabad which has historical importance. One is Masjid-E-Sara-E-Meer-Alam and second one is Qutub shahi mosque. There are many polish mills, cement and power plants are there in wadapally Surroundings.

The plastron is yellowish, sometimes with dark blotches in the centers of the scutes. The straight carapace length is . The carapace is low and broad, usually widest behind the middle, and in adults is smooth, lacking a keel or serrations. Adult western pond turtles are sexually dimorphic, with males having a light or pale yellow throat. Distribution The western pond turtle originally ranged from northern Baja California, Mexico, north to the Puget Sound region of Washington. It was once a large part of a major fishery on Tulare Lake, California, supplying San Francisco with a local favorite, turtle soup, as well as feed for hogs that learned to dive for it in the shallows of Hog Island, also on Tulare Lake. As of 2007, it has become rare or absent in the Puget Sound area. It has a disjunct distribution in most of the Northwest, and some isolated populations exist in southern Washington. The western pond turtle is now rare in the Willamette Valley north of Eugene, Oregon, but abundance increases south of that city where temperatures are higher. It may be locally common in some streams, rivers and ponds in southern Oregon. A few records are reported east of the Cascade Mountains, but these may have been based on introduced individuals. It ranges up to in Washington, and to about in Oregon. It also occurs in Uvas Canyon area, Santa Cruz Mountains, California, and in the North Bay, and lakes such as Fountaingrove Lake. Many taxonomic authorities now split what had been considered one species of turtle into two species. The southern species is named Actinemys pallida, or the southwestern pond turtle. Its range is southern California and Mexico. The northern species remains Actinemys marmorata, with a range of northern California northward. It is then usually referred to as the northwestern pond turtle. Ecology and behavior The western pond turtle occurs in both permanent and intermittent waters, including marshes, streams, rivers, ponds, and lakes. It favors habitats with large numbers of emergent logs or boulders, where individuals aggregate to bask. They also bask on top of aquatic vegetation. Consequently, this species is often overlooked in the wild. However, it is possible to observe resident turtles by moving slowly and hiding behind shrubs and trees. A. marmorata can be encouraged to use artificial basking substrate, or rafts, which allows for easy detection of the species in complex habitats. In addition to its aquatic habitat, terrestrial habitat is also extremely important for the western pond turtle. Since many intermittent ponds can dry up during summer and fall months along the west coast, especially during times of drought, the western pond turtle can spend upwards of 200 days out of water. Many turtles overwinter outside of the water, during which time they often create their nests for the year.  Diet  The western pond turtle is omnivorous and most of its animal diet includes insects, crayfish, and other aquatic invertebrates. Fish, tadpoles, and frogs are eaten occasionally, and carrion is eaten when available. Plant foods include filamentous algae, lily pads, tule and cattail roots. Juveniles are primarily carnivorous, and eat insects and carrion. At about age three they begin to eat plant matter. Predation and threat  Because of its hard shell, the western pond turtle is generally well protected. However, several predators do threaten this species, especially hatchlings, due to their small size and soft shell. Raccoons, otters, ospreys, and coyotes are the biggest natural threat to this turtle, and hatchlings have the additional threats of weasels, bullfrogs, non-native crayfish, and large fish. Finally, this species is threatened by humankind. Due to habitat destruction, this species is currently listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. With the removal of ponds, wetlands, and contamination of other water sources, this species is vulnerable and at risk of becoming extinct without the continuing efforts of reintroducing this turtle to its native range. Reproduction thumb Sexually mature females of the western pond turtle produce 5‚Äì13 eggs per clutch. They deposit eggs either once or twice a year. They may travel some distance from water for egg-laying, moving as much as 0.8 km (1/2 mile) away from and up to above the nearest source of water, but most nests are within of water. The female usually leaves the water in the evening and may wander far before selecting a nest site, often in an open area of sand or hardpan that is facing southwards. The nest is flask-shaped with an opening of about . Females spend considerable time covering up the nest with soil and adjacent low vegetation, making it difficult for a person to find unless it has been disturbed by a predator. Hatchlings The vast majority of western pond turtle hatchlings overwinter in the nest, and this phenomenon seems prevalent in most parts of the range, especially northern areas. This might explain the difficulty researchers have had in trying to locate hatchlings in the fall months. Winter rains may be necessary to loosen the hardpan soil where some nests are deposited. It may be that the nest is the safest place for hatchlings to shelter while they await the return of warm weather. Whether it is hatchlings or eggs that overwinter, young first appear in the spring following the year of egg deposition. Individuals grow slowly in the wild, and their age at their first reproduction may be 10 to 12 years in the northern part of the range. The western pond turtle may survive more than 50 years in the wild. References =Bibliography= *Holland, Dan C., PhD. The Western Pond Turtle: Habitat and History, Final Report.

Description The Stony Clove starts near the Stony Clove Notch in Edgewood in Greene County. It originates at Notch Lake, near the Devil's Tombstone Campsite, and flows through the small villages of Edgewood and Lanesville, entering Ulster County at Chichester. History Early maps and deeds indicate that the Stony Clove flowed into the Warner Bushkill, or alternatively named, the Barber Bushkill, before flowing into the Esopus. Later cartographers have changed the nomenclature of the streams so that the Barber Bushkill or Warner Bushkill flows into the Stony Clove. It was formed about 10,000 years ago, during the last Ice age. It was formed when the same meltwater that formed the Stony Clove Notch burst through, and flooded a valley. The water, in turn, started running down through an already gouged-out pass, forming a small river.

The statutes provide significant savings when the land is currently in use for farming (agriculture and horticulture), silviculture, or comprises wetlands, or even unproductive woods or barrens. Further discounts may accrue if the land owner is willing to file a recreational easement permitting the unimpeded public to come upon the land for non-motorized recreation (e.g., hiking, hunting, bicycling, bird- watching, etc.). Some jurisdictions require a qualifying submittal of a \\"stewardship plan\\" for woodlands, while others (including New Hampshire) provide further tax reductions for these optional inclusions. Soils data must often be included for requests related to agricultural areas. Based upon a modest tax assessment of land that remains undeveloped, the \\"current use\\" abatement and recreational easement can result in very affordable tax bills. The reduced burden may help postpone the decision to divide and sell off portions of the undeveloped land as local tax rates climb. The public benefits from the continued presence (or recreational enjoyment) of unfragmented and undeveloped areas until development plans overtake the current use incentives. In New Hampshire, USA, the owner of ten or more contiguous acres can file for the current use abatement for that portion of land not currently covered by structures or other improvements. The same application form is used to request the recreational easement, which is then recorded in the county registry of deeds. The abatement then persists until the land is subdivided or developed, at which time the local tax authority can reclaim some of the deferred taxes through a \\"change of use\\" tax. The recreation easement may also be revoked (or suspended for three years) if the land owner posts the property against trespassing. There is often an influx of new \\"current use\\" requests each time a town increases its assessments of open space, and the impact of this factor must be anticipated in the municipal tax budget. For example, a town with non- participating parcels may have only a net tax increase in the first-year after a higher assessment as many remaining qualified open parcels will join the current use program. Once they obtain the statutory abatement, they may actually pay less tax than before the higher assessments were imposed.

Flue gases are produced when coal, oil, natural gas, wood or any other fuel is combusted in an industrial furnace, a power plant's steam-generating boiler, or other large combustion device. Flue gas is usually composed of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor as well as nitrogen and excess oxygen remaining from the intake combustion air. It also contains a small percentage of pollutants such as particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides. The flue gas stacks are often quite tall, up to 400 metres (1300 feet) or more, so as to disperse the exhaust pollutants over a greater area and thereby reduce the concentration of the pollutants to the levels required by governmental environmental policy and environmental regulation. When the flue gases are exhausted from stoves, ovens, fireplaces, or other small sources within residential abodes, restaurants, hotels, or other public buildings and small commercial enterprises, their flue gas stacks are referred to as chimneys. History The first industrial chimneys were built in the mid-17th century when it was first understood how they could improve the combustion of a furnace by increasing the draft of air into the combustion zone.Douet, James (1988). Going up in Smoke:The History of the Industrial Chimney, Victorian Society, London, England. Victorian Society Casework Reports As such, they played an important part in the development of reverberatory furnaces and a coal-based metallurgical industry, one of the key sectors of the early Industrial Revolution. Most 18th-century industrial chimneys (now commonly referred to as flue gas stacks) were built into the walls of the furnace much like a domestic chimney. The first free-standing industrial chimneys were probably those erected at the end of the long condensing flues associated with smelting lead. The powerful association between industrial chimneys and the characteristic smoke-filled landscapes of the industrial revolution was due to the universal application of the steam engine for most manufacturing processes. The chimney is part of a steam- generating boiler, and its evolution is closely linked to increases in the power of the steam engine. The chimneys of Thomas Newcomen‚Äôs steam engine were incorporated into the walls of the engine house. The taller, free-standing industrial chimneys that appeared in the early 19th century were related to the changes in boiler design associated with James Watt‚Äôs \\"double-powered\\" engines, and they continued to grow in stature throughout the Victorian period. Decorative embellishments are a feature of many industrial chimneys from the 1860s, with over-sailing caps and patterned brickwork. The invention of fan-assisted forced draft in the early 20th century removed the industrial chimney's original function, that of drawing air into the steam-generating boilers or other furnaces. With the replacement of the steam engine as a prime mover, first by diesel engines and then by electric motors, the early industrial chimneys began to disappear from the industrial landscape. Building materials changed from stone and brick to steel and later reinforced concrete, and the height of the industrial chimney was determined by the need to disperse combustion flue gases to comply with governmental air pollution control regulations. Flue-gas stack draft The stack effect in chimneys: the gauges represent absolute air pressure and the airflow is indicated with light grey arrows. The gauge dials move clockwise with increasing pressure. The combustion flue gases inside the flue gas stacks are much hotter than the ambient outside air and therefore less dense than the ambient air. That causes the bottom of the vertical column of hot flue gas to have a lower pressure than the pressure at the bottom of a corresponding column of outside air. That higher pressure outside the chimney is the driving force that moves the required combustion air into the combustion zone and also moves the flue gas up and out of the chimney. That movement or flow of combustion air and flue gas is called \\"natural draft\\", \\"natural ventilation\\", \\"chimney effect\\", or \\"stack effect\\". The taller the stack, the more draft is created. The equation below provides an approximation of the pressure difference, ŒîP, (between the bottom and the top of the flue gas stack) that is created by the draft:Natural Ventilation Lecture 2 :\\\\Delta P =Cah\\\\bigg(\\\\frac {1}{T_o} - \\\\frac {1}{T_i}\\\\bigg) where: * ŒîP: available pressure difference, in Pa * C = 0.0342 * a: atmospheric pressure, in Pa * h: height of the flue gas stack, in m * To: absolute outside air temperature, in K * Ti: absolute average temperature of the flue gas inside the stack, in K. The above equation is an approximation because it assumes that the molar mass of the flue gas and the outside air are equal and that the pressure drop through the flue gas stack is quite small. Both assumptions are fairly good but not exactly accurate.  Flue-gas flow- rate induced by the draft As a \\"first guess\\" approximation, the following equation can be used to estimate the flue-gas flow-rate induced by the draft of a flue-gas stack. The equation assumes that the molar mass of the flue gas and the outside air are equal and that the frictional resistance and heat losses are negligible:.Natural Ventilation Lecture 3 :Q = CA\\\\sqrt {2gH\\\\frac{T_i - T_o}{T_i}} where: * Q: flue-gas flow-rate, m¬≥/s * A: cross- sectional area of chimney, m¬≤ (assuming it has a constant cross-section) * C : discharge coefficient (usually taken to be 0.65‚Äì0.70) * g: gravitational acceleration at sea level = 9.807 m/s¬≤ * H : height of chimney, m * Ti : absolute average temperature of the flue gas in the stack, K * To : absolute outside air temperature, K Also, this equation is only valid when the resistance to the draft flow is caused by a single orifice characterized by the discharge coefficient C. In many, if not most situations, the resistance is primarily imposed by the flue stack itself. In these cases, the resistance is proportional to the stack height H. This causes a cancellation of the H in the above equation predicting Q to be invariant with respect to the flue height. Designing chimneys and stacks to provide the correct amount of natural draft involves a great many factors such as: * The height and diameter of the stack. * The desired amount of excess combustion air needed to assure complete combustion. * The temperature of the flue gases leaving the combustion zone. * The composition of the combustion flue gas, which determines the flue-gas density. * The frictional resistance to the flow of the flue gases through the chimney or stack, which will vary with the materials used to construct the chimney or stack. * The heat loss from the flue gases as they flow through the chimney or stack. * The local atmospheric pressure of the ambient air, which is determined by the local elevation above sea level. The calculation of many of the above design factors requires trial-and-error reiterative methods. Government agencies in most countries have specific codes which govern how such design calculations must be performed. Many non-governmental organizations also have codes governing the design of chimneys and stacks (notably, the ASME codes). Stack design A helical strake on a chimney stack The design of large stacks poses considerable engineering challenges. Vortex shedding in high winds can cause dangerous oscillations in the stack, and may lead to its collapse. The use of helical strake is common to prevent this process occurring at or close to the resonant frequency of the stack. Other items of interest Some fuel-burning industrial equipment does not rely upon natural draft. Many such equipment items use large fans or blowers to accomplish the same objectives, namely: the flow of combustion air into the combustion chamber and the flow of the hot flue gas out of the chimney or stack. A great many power plants are equipped with facilities for the removal of sulfur dioxide (i.e., flue-gas desulfurization), nitrogen oxides (i.e., selective catalytic reduction, exhaust gas recirculation, thermal deNOx, or low NOx burners) and particulate matter (i.e., electrostatic precipitators). At such power plants, it is possible to use a cooling tower as a flue gas stack. Examples can be seen in Germany at the Power Station Staudinger Grosskrotzenburg and at the Rostock Power Station. Power plants without flue gas purification would experience serious corrosion in such stacks. In the United States and a number of other countries, atmospheric dispersion modeling www.air-dispersion.com studies are required to determine the flue gas stack height needed to comply with the local air pollution regulations. The United States also limits the maximum height of a flue gas stack to what is known as the \\"Good Engineering Practice (GEP)\\" stack height.Guideline for Determination of Good Engineering Practice Stack Height (Technical Support Document for the Stack Height Regulations), Revised (1985), EPA Publication No. EPA‚Äì450/4‚Äì80‚Äì023R, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (NTIS No. PB 85‚Äì225241)Lawson, Jr., R.E. and W.H.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (NTIS No. PB 83‚Äì207407) In the case of existing flue gas stacks that exceed the GEP stack height, any air pollution dispersion modelling studies for such stacks must use the GEP stack height rather than the actual stack height.

Brownell, 356 U.S. 44 (1958), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court affirmed Congress's right to revoke United States citizenship as a result of a citizen's voluntary performance of specified actions, even in the absence of any intent or desire on the person's part to lose citizenship. Specifically, the Supreme Court upheld an act of Congress which provided for revocation of citizenship as a consequence of voting in a foreign election.. The precedent was repudiated nine years later in Afroyim v. Rusk,. in which the Supreme Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment's Citizenship Clause guaranteed citizens' right to keep their citizenship and overturned the same law that it had upheld in Perez.  Background  Clemente Martinez Perez was born in El Paso, Texas, on March 17, 1909. He resided in the United States until 1919 or 1920, when his parents took him to Mexico. In 1928, he was informed that he had been born in the state of Texas. During World War II, he applied for admission and was admitted into the United States as a Mexican alien railroad worker. His application for such entry contained his recitation that he was a native-born citizen of Mexico. By 1947, however, Perez had returned to Mexico, and in that year, he applied for admission to the United States as a citizen of the United States. Upon his arrival, he was charged with failing to register under the Selective Service Laws of the United States during the war. Under oath, Perez admitted that between 1944 and 1947, he had remained outside the United States to avoid military service and had voted in an election in Mexico in 1946. On May 15, 1953, he surrendered to immigration authorities in San Francisco as an alien unlawfully in the United States but claimed that he was a citizen of the United States by birth and thereby entitled to remain. The US District Court, however, found that Perez had lost his American citizenship, a decision that was affirmed by the court of appeals. The courts held that Congress can attach loss of citizenship only as a consequence of conduct engaged in voluntarily even if there was no intent or desire to lose citizenship. The law was enacted as the Nationality Act of 1940 (54 Stat 1137, as amended).  Decision  In 1958, a divided Supreme Court upheld the decisions because Perez \\"became involved in foreign political affairs and evidenced an allegiance to another country inconsistent with American citizenship, thereby abandoning his citizenship.\\" Two central holdings were these:  Subsequent developments  The court reversed itself in 1967 with its decision in Afroyim v. Rusk. It called section 401 of the Nationality Act of 1940 unconstitutional and stated that the Fourteenth Amendment prevents Congress from taking away citizenship without the citizen's assent.

Facts The Commonwealth established a Child Support scheme where a non-custodial parent was required to pay an amount of their income to the custodial parent to assist in the costs of raising their children. This scheme was established by the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 and the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989. Luton, a non-custodial parent challenged the scheme on the grounds that the payment was a form of tax because it was collected by the government, and section 55 of the constitution mandates that tax legislation must deal with matters of taxation only. Luton also claimed the Child Support Scheme conferred judicial powers on non-judicial officers. Thus, the legislation was contrary to Chapter III of the Constitution because it offended the doctrine of separation of powers. Decision The High Court unanimously held that the payment of child support was not a tax. Although the government collected the money, it was merely facilitating a necessary transfer of money between private citizens. It provided a mechanism for this exchange of an existing private obligation. See also * Constitutional basis of taxation in Australia * Australian constitutional law References * Winterton, G. et al.

Historian of the German Resistance Joachim Fest nominates Gr√∂ber, alongside Galen and Preysing as one of the individual senior clerics who came to lead Catholic resistance to Nazism in Germany.Fest, Joachim. Plotting Hitler's Death: The German Resistance to Hitler 1933-1945, Weidenfeld & Nicolson; London; p.32 Life =Youth and education= Gr√∂ber was born in Messkirch in 1872,Catholic Hierarchy - Archbishop Conrad Gr√∂ber to Alois and Martina Gr√∂ber. His father was a master carpenter. Gr√∂ber grew up during the period of the Kulturkampf. He first attended the gymnasium in Donaueschingen, then the Heinrich Suso-Gymnasium in Konstanz, and was an alumnus of the reopened Konradihaus (St. Conrad's Archdiocesan House of Studies). Already as a gymnasium student he had decided on a ministerial career. At the Albert- Ludwigs University in Freiburg im Breisgau he studied philosophy and theology starting in the winter semester of 1891-1892. In 1893 he became a student at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. He was ordained a priest in October 1897, and completed his time in Rome in 1898 with a doctorate in theology. After a short time of activity as a vicar in Ettenheim he was a curate for two years at the St. Stephanskirche in Karlsruhe, where he became familiar with the specific problems of a city pastorate. =Teacher and pastor in Konstanz= In 1901 he became rector of the Konradihaus in Konstanz. There he met the students Max Josef Metzger, later a priest murdered by the Nazis, and Martin Heidegger, whom he actually started on the path of philosophy, and toward whom he had a lifelong but tense relationship. In 1905 he assumed the pastorate of Holy Trinity Church in Konstanz, and in 1922 he became rector of the M√ºnster, the former cathedral church in Konstanz.Christoph Schmider et al.: Erzbischof Conrad Gr√∂ber. Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Freiburg (German). During the Konstanz years, Gr√∂ber was particularly active in publicity and scholarship. Under his direction the Holy Trinity Church and later the Konstanz M√ºnster were thoroughly restored. He was not only involved in the work of church-linked organizations, but was active as a member of the Centre Party and as a representative on the Konstanz city council. He organized the celebrations for the 800th anniversary of the canonization of bishop Conrad of Constance, celebrated in 1923, and through his collaboration at the diocesan synod of 1921, became known throughout the region. His ecclesiastical career took a step forward in 1923 when he was named a monsignor; in 1925 he was a canon of the cathedral chapter of Freiburg. In the diocesan curia he was assigned responsibility for liturgy and church music, in which capacity he introduced a new and warmly received diocesan hymnbook in 1929. At this time, Gr√∂ber also became active as a preacher in the new medium of radio. At the Freiburg Katholikentag (Catholic assembly) of 1929, he met Eugenio Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII), on whose behalf he was decisively involved in the negotiations toward a concordat with the Reich. =Archbishop of Freiburg= He was ordained Bishop of Meissen, Germany, in 1931, and was installed as Archbishop of Freiburg im Breisgau in 1932. Early support of the Nazi regime Gr√∂ber remains controversial to this day because of his stance during the Nazi era. In particular, in the first two years after the National Socialists' seizure of power, he hoped that the Church would be able to come to terms with them, and that it would be better to dialogue with them than to support resistance. For tactical reasons, Adolf Hitler repeatedly encouraged such hopes. Thus Gr√∂ber wrote in an exhortation dated 8 November 1933 on the subject of the vote and plebiscite regarding Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations, that it was a duty to the fatherland to show unanimity with one's fellow countrymen. Among the populace, his policy of cooperation gained Gr√∂ber the nickname of Der braune Bischof (the brown Bishop). Thus during the course of the subordination of provincial governments to the Nazi central government, he directed a congratulatory telegram to the National Socialist politician appointed as proconsul in Baden, Robert Heinrich Wagner, containing the following message: \\"At the mighty task which lies before you, I place myself as the chief shepherd of Catholics in Baden unreservedly at your side.\\" At the diocesan synod in Freiburg from 25‚Äì28 April 1933, he advised the diocesan clergy: \\"no provocation and no useless martyrdom.\\" In the negotiations to conclude the Reich concordat between Germany and the Holy See, even the German Bishops' Conference was kept at arm's length until shortly before the accord, but Gr√∂ber was provided preparatory information for the negotiations through his friend, Centre Party president Msgr. Ludwig Kaas; he eagerly promoted the process and thereby isolated himself from his fellow bishops. On 3 June 1933 a joint pastoral letter appeared from the German Bishops' Conference, the drafting of which the bishops had entrusted to Gr√∂ber. It contained a statement that if the State would only respect certain rights and requirements of the Church, the Church would gratefully and happily support the new situation. In August 1933 the Archdiocese of Freiburg published in its official newspaper, which was under Gr√∂ber's responsibility, a directive of the Baden Ministry for Culture and Education about offering the Hitler salute in religious instruction, and thereby officially sanctioned this behavior, which led to considerable outrage among the faithful of the diocese. On 10 October 1933 at a large Catholic event in Karlsruhe Gr√∂ber expressly thanked the \\"men of the government\\" for their appearance: \\"I will not betray any secret if I explain that in the course of the last few months the contacts of the Church government in Freiburg with the government in Karlsruhe have proceeded in the most friendly way. I also believe that I will not be betraying a secret, either to you or to the German people, if I say that I place myself unreservedly behind the new government and the new Reich.\\" The Baden Interior Minister Pflaumer honored the cooperation promised by Gr√∂ber and sent the following directive to police headquarters on 13 November 1933: \\"Forceful measures against Catholic clergymen outside the framework of the general laws are not permitted in the future.\\" At the end of the year 1933 Gr√∂ber complained in a letter to the Cardinal Secretary of State Eugenio Pacelli about priests critical of the regime, who had been taken into \\"protective custody\\" (Schutzhaft), that it had not always been possible to obtain from the clergy the intelligent reserve and opportune reflection that, under a full evaluation of the fundamental situation, protect individual clergymen from inconveniences. Also in this time came his decision, together with a few men of the cathedral, to become a \\"supporting member\\" of the SS. He argued for \\"the national right to maintain the nation‚Äôs racial origin unpolluted and to do whatever is necessary to guarantee this end.\\" After the war Gr√∂ber explained this by saying that at the time the SS in Freiburg was considered the most decent organization of the Party. In 1941 Gr√∂ber, whilst supporting attempts to help persecuted Jews, wrote in a pastoral letter that the sad state of the Jews resulted from the curse that they had brought upon themselves when they murdered Christ. Anton Rauscher has said that Catholic theology of the era reflected \\"a view of the Jews which provoked anti-Semitism on the one hand, while on the other undermining the ability to oppose it.\\" German original archived by WebCite at ; also available at On Good Friday of 1941 he gave a sermon whose vocabulary came very close to the anti-Semitic vocabulary of the Nazi rulers: > \\"As a driving force behind the Jewish legal power stood the aggressive > toadyism and malevolent perfidy of the Pharisees. They unmasked themselves > more than ever as Christ's arch-enemies, deadly enemies.... Their eyes were > blindfolded by their prejudice and blinded by their Jewish lust for worldly > dominion.\\" As for the \\"people\\" or, in his words, the \\"wavering crowd of > Jews\\", the archbishop said, \\"The Pharisees' secret service had awakened the > animal in it through lies and slander, and it was eager for grisly > excitement and blood.\\" About Judas: \\"This unspeakable wretch... sits > sycophantically at the Lord's Supper... at which Satan went into him... and > placed him at the lead of the present-day servants of Judas.... In true > Jewish fashion, he bargained with the high priests.... He [Christ] is > betrayed with the sign of love bubbling over, with a smacking kiss from > dirty Judas lips.\\" Finally at the scene of the Ecce Homo: \\"All the sympathy > of the Jews is hidden under barbaric rawness. The beast has smelled human > blood and wants to slake its wild-burning thirst with it.... At the same > time the insane but truthful self-curse of the Jews screams: His blood come > upon us and our children! The curse has been frightfully fulfilled. Unto > this present day...\\" Resistance to the Nazi regime Conrad Gr√∂ber was among those in the Catholic hierarchy in Germany who came to articulate and support resistance to the Nazis. From the early Nazi period, Gr√∂ber made statements critical of the regime. In contrast to the majority of the German bishops, he supported a public protest of the Catholic Church against the call on 1 April 1933 to boycott Jewish businesses (\\"with consideration for innocent persons and converts\\"). In his Lenten pastoral letter of 10 February 1933 Gr√∂ber exhorted the faithful of the diocese, each according to his abilities, to take care that lying and slander, demagogy and hate, acts of violence and murder not further besmirch the name of Germany. Like the Catholic Church in general, Gr√∂ber was targeted for attacks by the authorities. Besides the ban on other parties and the dissolution of many Catholic non-church associations, the authorities resorted to personal insults. In 1936 Julius Streicher went on a speaking campaign in Baden in which he attacked the Church and personally attacked Gr√∂ber over an alleged love relationship with a Jewish woman, and filed a morals complaint against him. The resulting rumors were also fostered by a Catholic priest, the Nazi party member Dr. Heinrich Mohr, who had hopes of gaining a bishop's seat after Gr√∂ber's removal. From 1935 on, Gr√∂ber fought against the Nazi regime, notably only within the framework provided by law and in particular the concordat. On 15 July 1938, Britain's Catholic Herald reported that Groeber had released \\"An amazing document... giving a picture of the religious situation in Germany after five years of Nazi rule\\". The document protested a religious persecution of Catholics in Germany, detailing attacks on clergy, interference in the practice of the faith and operation of welfare organisations, confiscation of church property, restrictions on preaching the Gospel, and suppression of the Catholic press and Catholic education.After Five Years of Nazi Rule; Catholic Herald; 15 July 1938; p. 9 After the beginning of the organized killing of the mentally and physically handicapped, termed euthanasia, he protested in a letter to the Baden Interior Minister Pflaumer, and was the first of the German bishops to do so in writing, according to Schwalbach. (hagiographical, but with many original quotes) On 1 August 1940, Gr√∂ber wrote to the head of the Reich Chancellery, and warned that the murders would damage Germany's reputation. He offered to pay all costs being incurred by the state for the \\"care of mentally ill people intended for death\\".Richard J. Evans; The Third Reich at War; Penguin Press; New York 2009, pp.96 His courageous New Year's Eve sermons in the Freiburg M√ºnster and his Lenten pastoral letters became especially effective with the public. In them he particularly lashed the Nazi regime's enmity toward the Church and, according to Schwalbach, assailed euthanasia, which he described as murder, in the New Year's Eve sermon of 1941. Gr√∂ber held a protective arm over the German resistance worker Gertrud Luckner. Luckner organized, with the support of Gr√∂ber, an \\"Office for Religious War Relief\\" (Kirchliche Kriegshilfsstelle) under the auspices of the Catholic aid agency, Caritas. The office became the instrument through which Freiburg Catholics helped racially persecuted \\"non-Aryans\\" (both Jews and Christians).The Righteous Among the Nations - Gertrud Luckner; published by Yad Vashem; retrieved 8 September 2013 Luckner drove this relief effort, using funds received from the archbishop to smuggle Jews to Switzerland and communicate the conditions for Jews to the outside world. She personally investigated the fate of the Jews being transported to the East and managed to obtain information on prisoners in concentration camps, and obtain clothing, food and money for forced labourers and prisoners of war.Gertrud Luckner; German Resistance Memorial Centre, Index of Persons; retrieved at 4 September 2013 Luckner was arrested by the Gestapo in November 1943, and imprisoned at Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp. The Kreisau Circle formed from around 1937 as one of the few clandestine German opposition groups operating inside Nazi Germany.Alan Bullock; Hitler: a Study in Tyranny; HarperPerennial Edition 1991Peter Hoffmann; The History of the German Resistance 1933-1945; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald & Jane's; London; 1977; p 33. Though multi-denominational, it had a strongly Christian orientation. Its outlook was rooted both in German romantic and idealist tradition and in the Catholic doctrine of natural law.Graml, Mommsen, Reichhardt & Wolf; The German Resistance to Hitler; B. T. Batsford Ltd; London; 1970; p. 100-101 Among its central membership were the Jesuit Fathers Augustin R√∂sch, Alfred Delp and Lothar K√∂nig. K√∂nig acted as an intermediary between the group and Conrad Grober.Lothar K√∂nig; German Resistance Memorial Centre, Index of Persons; retrieved at 4 September 2013 For the Nazi authorities, Gr√∂ber was the \\"most evil rabblerouser against the Third Reich\\". The Baden Culture Minister Dr. Paul Schmitthenner described him in a file notation of 8 August 1940 as the greatest enemy of the NSDAP and the National Socialist State. Only his office as Archbishop had kept him, wrote Schmitthenner, from already sitting in jail for high treason. Response to persecution of priests On the other hand, he is still reproached to this day on the ground that he had not sufficiently supported the suffragan bishop Johannes Baptista Sproll who was driven out of his diocese of Rottenburg as early as 1938. Gr√∂ber wrote a still controversial letter to the president of the Volksgerichtshof (People's Court) Roland Freisler, who had sentenced to death Max Josef Metzger, a priest of his diocese: While part of the literature considers this letter as a last-ditch approach used as a tactical measure, in order to obtain the conversion of the death sentence into a prison term, another part of the literature considers it a cowardly distancing from a man sentenced to death on invalid grounds. Yet source criticism is necessary here: other documents from those days show that Gr√∂ber in fact did take steps to gain a mitigation of the penalty. Thus it is clear Gr√∂ber believed that only by recognizing the grounds for the judgment could he have even a minimal chance of success vis-√†-vis Freisler. On 12 November, Gr√∂ber informed his diocesan clergy of the sentence against Metzger, with, among others, the following words: In the aftermath of the war In a pastoral letter of 8 May 1945 he declared that no one should succumb to any extreme anti-Semitism. In his eyes the Holocaust was wrong because it forced the Jews into a defensive position from which they could cause the State greater harm than many a powerful enemy army. Immediately after the war's end Gr√∂ber enjoyed great respect because of his courageous speeches against the regime, and was made an honored citizen of Me√ükirch and Freiburg. Consulted as an advisor and mediator, he took a position against the re-establishment of the Centre Party, but instead supported the collection of all the Christian forces in the later CDU. Yet the bitter confrontations from the Nazi era remained: Gr√∂ber tried to silence an event for the so-called \\"concentration camp priests\\", initiated by Pastor Wilhelm K√∂hler and Richard Schneider, who was the first diocesan clergyman taken to the Dachau concentration camp in 1940, although 5 of the 16 clergymen from Gr√∂ber's diocese imprisoned in the camp were murdered. The \\"concentration camp priests\\", like the priests of the M√ºnster diocese who were honored in a solemn way in a pontifical service by the bishop of M√ºnster, wanted to commemorate their dead confreres and impress upon the public consciousness that the latter must not be allowed to have died in vain. The priests expressed the reproaches made against them in a resolution: \\"We are saddened when even now we have to hear from the clergy that we had only our own foolishness to blame, that we were victims of the Gestapo. We find it hard to avoid the impression that a priest was better liked by the church administration, the less he came into contact with the Secret State Police.\\" Works *Geschichte des Jesuitenkollegs und -Gymnasiums in Konstanz, 1904 *Das Konstanzer M√ºnster.

These midrashim, although bearing the name of R. Tan·∏•uma, must not be regarded as having been written or edited by him. They were so named merely because they consist partly of homilies originating with him (this being indicated by the introductory formula \\"Thus began R. Tan·∏•uma\\" or \\"Thus preached R. Tan·∏•uma\\") and partly of homilies by aggadic teachers who followed the style of R. Tan·∏•uma. It is possible that R. Tan·∏•uma himself preserved his homilies, and that his collection was used by the editors of the midrash. The three collections were edited at different times; they will, therefore, be treated in chronological order. According to Samuel Berman's most recent research and translation on Midrash-Tanhuma, the \\"earliest manuscript of this text was compiled in late 8th or 9th century\\".  Tan·∏•uma A  Tan·∏•uma A, also called Tanchuma Buber, is the collection published by S. Buber,Wilna, 1885 who gathered the material from several manuscripts. Buber claimed that this collection, consisting of homilies on and aggadic interpretations of the weekly sections of the Pentateuch, was the oldest of the three, perhaps even the oldest compilation of its kind arranged as a running commentary on the Pentateuch, and he identified several passages which he saw as being quoted by Bereshit Rabbah. Buber postulated that this midrash (Tan·∏•uma) was edited in the 5th century, before the completion of the Babylonian Talmud. Buber cites a passage in the Babylonian Talmud that seems to indicate that the redactor of that work had referred to the Midrash Tan·∏•uma. Other scholars disagree, however, and do not see the Buber recension of Tanchuma as being older than the other versions. Townsend cites a section from Buber's recension which appears to be a quote from Sherira Gaon's Sheiltot (8th century).ed. Townsend, Midrash Tanchuma, 12 This passage·∏≤id. 33b says that two amoraim differed in their interpretations of the words \\"and they looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle\\"Exodus 33:8 One amora interpreted the words in a complimentary sense, while the other held that the people looked after Moses and made unfavorable remarks about him. The favorable interpretation only is given in the Talmud, while the adverse opinion is referred to with the words \\"ki de-ita\\" (as it is said). Inasmuch as the adverse view is given in the Tan·∏•uma Pe·∏≥ude,ed. Buber, p. 65a it is extremely probable that the words \\"ki de-ita\\" in the Talmud have reference to the former work, or that the reference originally read \\"ki de-ita be-Tan·∏•uma\\" (as it is said in the Tan·∏•uma), the words \\"be-Tan·∏•uma\\" having been eliminated later. The homilies contained in Midrash Tan·∏•uma A begin with the words \\"As the Scriptures say\\" or sometimes \\"As it is written.\\" Then follow a verse (in most cases taken from the Hagiographa), its explanation, and a homily on the particular passage of the Pentateuch referred to. Several of the homilies on the first, third, and fourth books of the Pentateuch begin with brief halakhic dissertations bearing on the passages to which the homilies refer. The halakhic treatises consist of a question introduced with the words \\"Yelammedenu rabbenu\\" (May our teacher instruct us), and of a reply beginning with the phrase \\"Kak shanu rabbotenu\\" (Thus have our teachers instructed us); the replies are always taken from either a mishnah or a baraita. Many of the homilies close with words of hope and encouragement regarding the future of the Jews; but several of them are abbreviated and not entirely completed, this curtailment being apologized for in the words \\"Much more might be said on this subject, but we shall not tire you\\",Noa·∏•. 26 27b or \\"This passage has been elucidated by several other interpretations and expositions, but in order not to tire you we quote only that which is necessary for today's theme\\".·∏§u·∏≥·∏≥at 16 57a = Contents = Although essentially an aggadic midrash, Tan·∏•uma A contains many halakhic sayings. In addition to its 61 introductions to homilies, which contain halakhic questions and answers, there are several halakhic rules and decisions quoted throughout the work. These halakhic passages were taken from the Mishnah or the Baraita, and not from the Babylonian Talmud; indeed, many of the decisions given are in opposition to those of the latter work.Compare S. Buber, Introduction, pp. 15 et seq. The aggadic contents of the midrash are also very extensive and varied; it contains, too, simple explanations of Scriptural passages; several refutations of heretics; explanations of the differences between \\"·∏≥ere\\" and \\"ketib\\" and between words written \\"plene\\" (\\"male\\") and defectively (\\"·∏•aser\\"); interpretations according to no·π≠ari·∏≥on and gematria; several narratives and parables; and numerous aphorisms, moral sayings, and popular proverbs. Some of the aphorisms and proverbs may be cited here: \\"One may not give an honest man an opportunity to steal, much less a thief\\".Vayishlach 12 85b \\"The office seeks those that would escape it\\".Vayikra 4 2b \\"If you yield not to wickedness, it will not follow you nor dwell by you\\".Tazria 11 20b \\"Do the wicked no good, in order that thou reap not that which is evil\\".·∏§u·∏≥·∏≥at 1 50a This Tan·∏•uma midrash has been referred to in many other midrashim, as, for example, all the Midrash Rabbot, Pesi·∏≥ta de-Rab Kahana, Pesikta Rabbati, and in the midrashim to Book of Samuel, Proverbs, and Psalms, which all quote passages from it. The Geonim also and the older rabbinical authorities made use of it, and cited halakhic as well as aggadic sentences from it.Compare S. Buber, l.c. pp. 37 et seq. The first to refer to this midrash by the name of \\"Tan·∏•uma\\", however, was Rashi, who mentions it in several passages of his commentary, and quotes from it. Most of Rashi's quotations are taken from Tan·∏•uma A.See Buber, l.c. pp. 44 et seq.  Tan·∏•uma B, or Yelammedenu  This second midrash with which the name of Tan·∏•uma, largely known through its being quoted in later works is associated is known as the \\"Yelammedenu\\" from the opening words of the halakhic introductions to the homilies‚Äî\\"Yelammedenu rabbenu\\" (May our teacher instruct us). It is referred to also under the name of Tan·∏•uma, though by only a few authorities, as Hai Gaon and Zedekiah ben Abraham.S. Buber, l.c. pp. 44a, 50a The reason for this confusion of names may be found in the fact that a later collection of midrashim (Tan·∏•uma C) included a great part of the material contained in the Yelammedenu, especially that referring to the second book of the Pentateuch. The Yelammedenu, which contains several passages from Tan·∏•uma A, is often cited in the \\"Aruk,\\" and has been extensively referred to by the redactor of the Yal·∏≥u·π≠. Other old rabbinical authorities refer to the Yelammedenu by that name, and quote passages from it; but otherwise the work has been completely lost. Tan·∏•uma C The third aggadic midrash to the Pentateuch bearing the name of Tan·∏•uma became the standard published edition, and it contains many passages taken from A and B. It is, in fact, an amended edition of the two earlier works, with various additions by later authors. Its homilies on Genesis are original, although they contain several revised passages from Tan·∏•uma A as well as from the Yelammedenu, the Babylonian Talmud being largely drawn upon for additional interpretations and expositions. The part referring to Exodus is borrowed almost entirely from the Yelammedenu, with the exception of the Vayakhel and Pekudei sections, which contain homilies not embodied in the lost work. For the portions to the books of Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy the redactor of this midrash has made extensive use of the material that he found in Tan·∏•uma A, which he has revised and supplied with numerous additions. The first authority to cite this midrash was Rashi, who in some passages of his commentary refers to Tan·∏•uma C and not to the A collection.Compare S. Buber, l.c. pp. 44 et seq. Because the third midrash contains much of the material of the lost Yelammedenu, the two works were often confounded. Some authorities believed that it was the Tan·∏•uma C and not the Yelammedenu which had been lost.Menahem Lonzano, in Ma'arik, s.v. \\"Tan·∏•uma\\"; comp. Azulai, Shem ha-Gedolim, ii. Others erroneously considered this midrash identical with the Yelammedenu, thinking the work had a double title; and the first editions of Tan·∏•uma C appeared, therefore, under the title \\"Midrash Tan·∏•uma, Called Also the Yelammedenu.\\" Tan·∏•uma C was first published at Constantinople in 1522, and was reprinted without emendation at Venice in 1545. The third edition, which served as a basis for all the later editions, was published at Mantua in 1563 by Me√Ør ben Abraham of Padua and Ezra of Fano. This edition contains several additions, consisting of single sentences as well as of entire paragraphs, which Ezra of Fano selected from two of the original manuscripts and also from the Yal·∏≥u·π≠. Ezra indicated the added matter by marking it with open hands, but in the following editions these marks were omitted, so that it is no longer possible to distinguish between original contents and material added by revisers. Ezra of Fano further added to his edition an index of all halakhic decisions, as well as of the legends and parables contained in this midrash; this index has been retained in all later editions.

Wright until 2009) was a chain of about 129 American retail/outlet stores established in 1998 and owned by TJX Companies. Like its sister company T.J. Maxx, AJWright sold clothing, domestics, giftware, footwear, accessories, and fragrances at prices between twenty and seventy percent below regular prices. AJWright differed from other TJX chains by refreshing its merchandise on a regular basis. For most stores, new shipments arrived every weekday. In early 2011, TJX closed the chain's remaining stores and converted some stores to other TJX brands. Although AJWright's primary target market was moderate-income families, its recent expansion drew additional consumer groups. The company's community service strategy centered on monetary donations to the Boys and Girls Club of America and other affiliates. History AJWright's former logo, used until 2009 AJWright opened its first six stores in the northeastern region of the United States in the fall of 1998. The first three stores - located in the towns of Brockton, Somerville, and Malden, Massachusetts - were opened simultaneously on September 20 of that year. During the initial openings, Johnson & Wales University's marketing director, Mark Neckes, approved of AJWright; he stated that AJWright strengthens TJX's coverage of urban markets, an area \\"where people need a place to shop [and] a place where retailers understand what people are looking for\\". AJWright continued to open new stores as its customer base increased. By 2000, AJWright operated 25 stores across the United States; by December 2001, the number had increased to 40. The chain opened an additional 112 stores by the end of 2005, bringing its total to 152; however, this number fluctuated due to store closures. In 2006, one business article stated that AJWright was \\"in the red\\" and that TJX needed to \\"figure out the future of its newer divisions, the less profitable AJWright and HomeGoods stores and the non-off-price Bob‚Äôs Stores\\". Therefore, the company chose to focus on lowering the rapid expansion of the chain. One of the 34 stores undergoing closing procedures On November 30, 2006, TJX announced the closure of 34 underproducing stores. According to a TJX 10-Q on December 1, 2006, the closures were determined by \\"several factors, including market demographics and proximity to other AJWright stores, cash return, sales volume and productivity, recent comparable store sales and profit trends, and overall market performance\\". Employees were provided with severance packages or offers to transfer to other AJWright or TJX stores. Ben Cammarata, CEO of TJX Companies, stated: The tentative closure date for the stores was January 27, 2007. Because of closing expenses, TJX expected to include a reduction of $37 million in their fourth quarter 2006 net income statement. On February 21, 2007, TJX reported that the net income had fallen from $288.7 million the previous year to $205.5 million; the reduction included the $37 million closing expenses. The company expected to open about ten new stores by 2008. During this period, the TJX database was hacked and customer information was compromised. Although TJX originally stated that the security breach occurred between May 2006 and January 2007, the company discovered that the database had also been compromised in 2005. In December, 2010 TJX corporation announced a consolidation that would eliminate the A.J. Wright chain. Many A.J. Wright stores were converted into T.J. Maxx, Marshalls or HomeGoods stores, while the remaining were permanently shuttered along with distribution centers.

It is a midrash comprising a collection of ancient rabbinical homiletic interpretations of the book of Numbers (Bamidbar in Hebrew). In the first printed edition of the work (Constantinople, 1512), it is called Bamidbar Sinai Rabbah. Nahmanides (1194‚Äìc. 1270) and others cite it frequently by the same name. It is the latest component of Midrash Rabbah on the Torah, and as such was unknown to Nathan ben Jehiel (c. 1035‚Äì1106), Rashi (1040‚Äì1105), and Yalkut Shimoni. Relation to Tanchuma Numbers Rabbah consists of two parts, which are of different origin and extent. The first portion, sections 1‚Äì14 (on Torah portions Bamidbar and Naso) ‚Äî almost three- quarters of the whole work ‚Äî contains a late homiletic commentary upon . The second part, sections 15‚Äì33, reproduces the Midrash Tanchuma from almost word for word. Midrash Tanchuma generally covered in each case only a few verses of the text and had regular formulas of conclusion. The second portion of Numbers Rabbah follows closely those readings of the Tanchuma that appear in the oldest edition. M. Beneviste drew attention as early as 1565 to the fact that Tanchuma and Numbers Rabbah are almost identical from the section Behaalotecha onward. Solomon Buber gave a list of the variations between the two. Passages drawn from the Pesikta Rabbati are found exclusively in the first or later part of this Midrash. This is true also, with the exception of the interpretation of the numerical value of the Hebrew word for fringes, of the other passages pointed out by Leopold Zunz as originating with later, and notably French, rabbis. This numerical interpretation of ‚Äúfringes‚Äù forms a part of a passage, also otherwise remarkable, at the end of the section on Korach (18:21), which, taken from Numbers Rabbah, was interpolated in the first printed edition of the Tanchuma as early as 1522, but is absent from all the manuscripts. Another long passage (18:22) which belongs to the beginning of Chukat, as in Tanchuma, is erroneously appended in the editions to the section on Korach. The legal discussion on at the beginning of the second part is cut down to its concluding passage. A Paris manuscript contains the exordium complete with its customary formula, as usual in Tanchuma, using a formula that reappears throughout this portion of Numbers Rabbah. Synagogue recitation The portions of Numbers to which there are Tanchuma homilies in this portion of Numbers Rabbah were intended for public worship according to the divisions of the cycle of the Torah portions and the Pesikta. The variations existing in the division into Torah portions probably explain why some of the old Torah portions appear in Numbers Rabbah without these homilies in some sections, while such homilies or at least fragments of them are appended to other passages. In this portion of Numbers Rabbah, as in its source, the Tanchuma, the collected homilies have been considerably metamorphosed and disjointed. Many are quite fragmentary, and others discursive. Although the marking of the Torah portions at their beginnings and in marginal superscriptions is a departure in the Venice edition, the sections of the second part are indicated according to the usual notation of the Torah portions. With the exception of sections 16 and 17, which belong to Shlach each section contains a Torah portion of the one-year cycle, which was already recognized when Numbers Rabbah was compiled. There are even Tanchuma Midrashim extant with divisions according to the Torah portions, while the Tanchuma, in its earliest editions, is alone in using the original arrangement based on the Torah portion cycle. In Numbers Rabbah, the divisions according to separate homilies are no longer recognizable. Authorship Since the second part of Numbers Rabbah, additions excepted, is derived from the Tanchuma Midrashim, the question arises whether it and part 1 (sections 1‚Äì14) should be ascribed to one author. It is improbable that the author of the comparatively late commentary on the Torah portions Bamidbar and parashah Naso ‚Äî supposing that the Midrash on these two is the work of a single author ‚Äî should have deliberately rounded out this incomplete work with the Midrash Tanchuma. According to Epstein, some unknown author wrote the Midrash upon the Torah portion Bamidbar to complete the Sifre, which commences with , another then continued it with the commentary on Naso, and in order to complete the work for the remainder of Numbers, the commentary for the remaining Torah portions was drawn from Tanchuma. It must also be mentioned that a manuscript in the Paris National Library, dating from the year 1291, contains only the Torah portion Bamidbar, while the Munich manuscript dated 1418 covers only this and Naso. Even the first part contains much that is taken from the Tanchuma, but, as Zunz wrote, \\"a copious stream of new Haggadah swallows the Midrash drawn from this source and entirely obscures the arrangement of the Yelamdenu.\\" In the Torah portion Bamidbar, the outer framework of the original composition is still recognizable. There are five sections, containing five homilies or fragments, taken from the Tanchuma on 2:1, 3:14, 3:40, and 4:17, which are expanded by some very discursive additions. As Tanchuma only addresses the first verses of each chapter, no doubt the author's intention was to supply homiletic commentary to the others. But in the section on Naso, which is more than three times the volume of that preceding, there are long passages that have no relation to the Tanchuma homilies, based as they are upon the Torah reading cycle, and commencing in Naso with . Sections 6, 7, 8, and 10, which, like the other lengthy sections in which the material derived from the Tanchuma are overwhelmed in a flood of new homiletic interpretations, show even more clearly the endeavor to supply homilies and continuous expositions for all sections of Naso. Zunz wrote: \\"Instead of the brief explanations or allegories of the ancients, instead of their uniform citation of authorities, we have here compilations from halakic and haggadic works, intermingled with artificial and often trivial applications of Scripture, and for many pages continuously we find no citation of any source whatever.\\" The industry and skill of the unknown author of this fragmentary work was nonetheless remarkable. The author, for example in sections 13 and 14 on , gave a different interpretation to each one of the twelve passages enumerating the offerings of princes of the tribes ‚Äî identical in all but the name of the prince in the Biblical text. Approximate date This portion of the Numbers Rabbah shows all the marks of the late haggadic age. There is much which can be referred to Rabbi Moses ha-Darshan (11th Century), and which reveals a connection with Midrash Tadshe. The work is, according to Zunz, hardly older than the 12th Century. The Encyclopaedia Judaica also dates it to the 12th Century.

Its closest relative may be the extinct Tasmanian emu (D. n. diemenensis), as they belonged to a single population until less than 14,000 years ago when Tasmania and King Island were still connected. The small size of the King Island emu may be an example of insular dwarfism. The King Island emu was the smallest of all known emus and had darker plumage than the mainland emu. It was black and brown and had naked blue skin on the neck, and its chicks were striped like those on the mainland. The subspecies was distinct from the likewise diminutive Kangaroo Island emu (D. n. baudinianus) in a number of osteological details, including size. The behaviour of the King Island emu probably did not differ much from that of the mainland emu. The birds gathered in flocks to forage and during breeding time. They fed on berries, grass and seaweed. They ran swiftly and could defend themselves by kicking. The nest was shallow and consisted of dead leaves and moss. Seven to nine eggs were laid, which were incubated by both parents. Europeans discovered the King Island emu in 1802 during early expeditions to the island, and most of what is known about the bird in life comes from an interview French naturalist Fran√ßois P√©ron conducted with a sealer there, as well as depictions by artist Charles Alexandre Lesueur. They had arrived on King Island in 1802 with Nicolas Baudin's expedition, and in 1804 several live and stuffed King and Kangaroo Island emus were sent to France. The two live King Island specimens were kept in the Jardin des Plantes, and the remains of these and the other birds are scattered throughout various museums in Europe today. The logbooks of the expedition did not specify from which island each captured bird originated, or even that they were taxonomically distinct, so their status remained unclear until more than a century later. Hunting pressure and fires started by early settlers on King Island likely drove the wild population to extinction by 1805. The captive specimens in Paris both died in 1822 and are believed to have been the last of their kind. Taxonomy Charles Alexandre Lesueur's 1807 plate of the head, wing and feathers of a possible King Island emu There was long confusion regarding the taxonomic status and geographic origin of the small island emu taxa from King Island and Kangaroo Island, since specimens of both populations were transported to France as part of the same French expedition to Australia in the early 1800s. The logbooks of the expedition failed to clearly state where and when the small emu individuals were collected, and this has resulted in a plethora of scientific names subsequently being coined for either bird, many on questionable grounds, and the idea that all specimens had originated from Kangaroo Island. Furthermore, in 1914, L. Brasil argued the expedition did not encounter emus on King Island, because the weather had been too bad for them to leave their camp. The French also referred to both emus and cassowaries as \\"casoars\\" at the time, which has led to further confusion. The French naturalist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot coined the binomial Dromaius ater in 1817. Various collectors found subfossil emu remains on King Island during the early 20th century, the first by the Australian amateur ornithologist Archibald James Campbell in 1903, near a lagoon on the east coast. In 1906, the Australian ornithologist Walter Baldwin Spencer coined the name Dromaius minor based on some Pleistocene subfossil bones and eggshells found on King Island. The Australian ornithologist William Vincent Legge also coined a name for these remains in 1906, Dromaius bassi, but at a later date. In his 1907 book Extinct Birds, the British zoologist Walter Rothschild stated that Vieillot's description actually referred to the mainland emu, and that the name D. ater was therefore invalid. Believing the skin in Mus√©um national d'Histoire naturelle of Paris was from Kangaroo Island, he made it the type specimen of his new species Dromaius peroni, named after the French naturalist Fran√ßois P√©ron, who is the main source of information about the bird in life. The Australian amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews coined further names in the early 1910s, including a new genus name, Peronista, as he believed the King and Kangaroo Island birds were generically distinct from the mainland emu. Later writers claimed that the subfossil remains found on King and Kangaroo Islands were not discernibly different, and that they therefore belonged to the same taxon. In 1959, the French ornithologist Christian Jouanin proposed that none of the skins were actually from Kangaroo Island, after inspecting expedition and museum documents. In 1990, Jouanin and the French palaeontologist Jean-Christophe Balouet used environmental forensics to demonstrate that the mounted skin in Paris came from King Island, and that at least one live bird had been brought from each island. All scientific names given to the Kangaroo Island emu were therefore based on specimens from King Island or were otherwise invalid, leaving it nameless. Based on later finds of subfossil material in 1984, the Australian ornithologist Shane A. Parker confirmed the separate geographic origin and distinct morphology of the King and Kangaroo Island emus. Parker named the Kangaroo Island bird Dromaius baudinianus, after Nicolas Baudin, the leader of the French expedition. The name Dromaius ater was kept for the King Island emu. 1807 cartouche of a small emu and other birds from a map of south east Australia and Kangaroo Island There are few morphological differences that distinguish the extinct insular emus from the mainland emu besides their size, but all three taxa were most often considered distinct species. A 2011 study by the Australian geneticist Tim H. Heupink and colleagues of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, which was extracted from five subfossil King Island emu bones, showed that its genetic variation fell within that of the extant mainland emus. It was therefore interpreted as conspecific with the emus of the Australian mainland, and was reclassified as a subspecies of Dromaius novaehollandiae, D. n. ater. Other animals present on King Island are also considered as subspecies of their mainland or Tasmanian counterparts rather than distinct species. The authors suggested that further studies using different methods might be able to find features that distinguish the taxa. In its 2013 edition, The Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World emended the trinomial name of the King Island emu to D. n. minor, based on Spencer's D. minor, on the ground that Vieillot's D. ater was originally meant for the mainland emu. This rationale was accepted by the IOC World Bird List, which used D. n. minor thereafter. In 2014‚Äì2015, the English palaeontologist Julian Hume and colleagues conducted a search for emu fossils on King Island; no major palaeontological surveys had been done since the early 20th century, apart from discoveries made by a local natural historian (including of a unique eggshell) during the preceding thirty years. In 2014, Hume and colleagues found emu subfossils in Cape Wickham, but upon returning to the site in 2015, the area had been turned into a golf course, and the researchers were denied access to the site. They cautioned in 2018 that other fossiliferous sites on King Island were also under such threat, and highlighted the need to protect them. The researchers also identified an area near Surprise Bay where subfossils had been collected in 1906, but found it almost impossible to find more, since the area had been covered in grass in the meantime (the grass had previously been kept down by livestock). =Evolution= 1834 illustration of the Paris skin by Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot During the Late Quaternary period (0.7 million years ago), small emus lived on a number of offshore islands of mainland Australia. In addition to the King Island emu, these included taxa found on Kangaroo Island (D. n. baudinianus) and Tasmania (D. n. diemenensis), all of which are now extinct. The smallest taxon, the King Island emu, was confined to a small island situated in the Bass Strait between Tasmania and Victoria, approximately 100 km (62 mi) from both coasts. King Island was once part of the land bridge which connected Tasmania and mainland Australia, but rising sea levels following the last glacial maximum eventually isolated the island. As a result of phenotypic plasticity the King Island emu population possibly underwent a process of insular dwarfism. Emu eggshells were also identified from Flinders Island (in the opposite, eastern end of the Bass Strait) in 2017, possibly representing a distinct taxon. According to the 2011 genetic study, the close relation between the King Island and mainland emus indicates that the former population was isolated from the latter relatively recently, due to sea level changes in the Bass Strait, as opposed to a founding emu lineage that diverged from the mainland emu far earlier and had subsequently gone extinct on the mainland. Models of sea level change indicate that Tasmania, including King Island, was isolated from the Australian mainland around 14,000 years ago. Up to several thousand years later King Island was then separated from Tasmania. This scenario would suggest that a population ancestral to both the King Island and Tasmanian emu was initially isolated from the mainland taxon, after which the King Island and Tasmanian populations were separated. This, in turn, indicates that the likewise extinct Tasmanian emu is probably as closely related to the mainland emu as is the King Island emu, with both the King Island and Tasmanian emu being more closely related to each other. Fossil emu taxa show an average size between that of the King Island emu and mainland emu. Hence, mainland emus can be regarded as a large or gigantic form. A 2018 study by Australian geneticist Vicki A. Thomson and colleagues (based on ancient bone, eggshell and feather samples) found that the emus of Kangaroo Island and Tasmania also represented sub-populations of the mainland emu, and therefore belonged in the same species, D. novaehollandiae. They also found that the size of the island emus scaled linearly to the size of the islands they inhabited (the King Island emu was the smallest, while the Tasmanian was the largest), while time in isolation did not affect their size. This suggest that island size was the important driver in dwarfism of these emus, probably due to limitation in resources, though the exact effect needs to be confirmed. The little genetic differentiation between island emus indicates their dwarfism evolved rapidly and independently since they became islated form each other. King Island is 1100 km2, and was isolated from Tasmania for 12.000 years, while 62 400 km2 Tasmania was itself isolated from mainland Australia for 14.000 years. Kangaroo island is 4400 km2 and was isolated from the mainland 10.000 years ago. A 2020 genetic study of the only known Kangaroo Island emu skin by the French ornithologist Alice Cibois and colleagues also supported retaining the three island emus as subspecies. Description Size comparison between a human, the mainland emu, and the King Island emu The King Island emu was the smallest type of emu and was about half the size of the mainland birds. It was about tall. According to Fran√ßois P√©ron's interview with a local sealer, the largest specimens were up to 137 cm (4.5 ft) in length, and the heaviest weighed 20 to 23 kg (45 to 50 lb). It had a darker plumage, with extensive black feathers on the neck and head, and blackish feathers on the body, where it was also mixed with brown. The bill and feet were blackish, and the naked skin on the side of the neck was blue. The 2011 genetic study did not find genes commonly associated with melanism in birds, but proposed the dark colouration could be due to alternative genetic or non-genetic factors. P√©ron stated there was little difference between the sexes, but that the male was perhaps brighter in colouration and slightly larger. The juveniles were grey, while the chicks were striped like other emus. There were no seasonal variations in plumage. Since the female mainland emus are on average larger than the males, and can turn brighter during the mating season, contrary to the norm in other bird species, some of these observations may have been based on erroneous conventional wisdom. Subfossil remains of the King Island emu show that the tibia was about 330 mm (13 in) long, and the femur was 180 mm (7 in) long. The pelvis was 280 mm (11 in) long, 64 mm (2.5 in) wide at the front, and 86 mm (3 in) wide at the back. The tarsometatarsus averaged 232 mm (9 in) in length. In males, the tibiotarsus averaged 261 mm (10 in), whereas it averaged 301 mm (12 in) in females. In contrast, the same bones measured 269 mm (10.5 in) and 305 mm (12 in) in the Kangaroo Island emu. Apart from being smaller, the King Island emu differed osteologically from the Kangaroo Island emu in the intertrochlear foramen of the tarsometatarsus usually being fully or partially abridged. The outer trochlea was more incurved towards the middle trochlea in the Kangaroo Island bird, whereas they were parallel in the King Island emu. Comparison of the cranium contour in mainland (A, B, C) and King Island emus (D, E) The King Island emu and the mainland emu show few morphological differences other than their significant difference in size. Mathews stated that the legs and bill were shorter than those of the mainland emu, yet the toes were nearly of equal length, and therefore proportionally longer. The tarsus of the King Island emu was also three times longer than the culmen, whereas it was four times longer in the mainland emu. Additional traits that supposedly distinguish this bird from the mainland emu have previously been suggested to be the distal foramen of the tarsometatarsus, and the contour of the cranium. However, the distal foramen is known to be variable in the mainland emu showing particular diversity between juvenile and adult forms and is therefore taxonomically insignificant. The same is true of the contour of the cranium, which is more dome-shaped in the King Island emu, a feature that is also seen in juvenile mainland emus. Behaviour and ecology 1893 Keulemans illustration based on the Paris skin P√©ron's interview described some aspects of the behaviour of the King Island emu. He wrote that the bird was generally solitary but gathered in flocks of ten to twenty at breeding time, then wandered off in pairs. They ate berries, grass and seaweed, and foraged mainly during morning and evening. They were swift runners, but were apparently slower than the mainland birds, due to being fat. They swam well, but only did so when necessary. They reportedly liked the shade of lagoons and the shoreline, rather than open areas. They used a claw on each wing for scratching themselves. If unable to flee from the hunting dogs of the sealers, they would defend themselves by kicking, which could inflict a great deal of harm. Leptecophylla juniperina berries, part of this emu's diet The English Captain Matthew Flinders did not encounter emus when he visited King Island in 1802, but his naturalist, Robert Brown, examined their dung and noted they had chiefly fed on the berries of Leptecophylla juniperina. An account by English ornithologist John Latham about the \\"Van Diemen's cassowary\\" may also refer to the King Island emu, based on the small size described. In addition to a physical description, he stated that they gathered in groups of 70 to 80 individuals in a given location while foraging, behaviour that was exploited by hunters. Hume and colleagues noted that most emu subfossils from King Island were found on the drier, leeward west coast of the island, and though probably due to preservation bias, they suggested that the emus were restricted to coastal and more open inland areas, and not found in the dense interior forests. An 1802 report by the English surveyor Charles Grimes also supported this, stating that \\"plenty on the coast‚Äìbut not inland\\". The tall, dense eucalypt forests of the island have since been destroyed. P√©ron stated that the nest was usually situated near water and on the ground under the shade of a bush. It was constructed of sticks and lined with dead leaves and moss; it was oval in shape and not very deep. He claimed that seven to nine eggs were laid always on 25 and 26 July, but the selective advantage of this breeding synchronisation is unknown. The female incubated the eggs, but the male apparently developed a brood patch, which indicates it contributed as well. The non-incubating parent also stayed by the nest, and the chicks left the nest two to three days after hatching. The eggs were preyed upon by snakes, rats, and quolls. P√©ron gave the incubation period as five or six weeks, but since the mainland emu incubates for 50 to 56 days, this may be too short. He stated a mother emu would defend its young from crows with its beak, but this is now known to be strictly male behaviour. Relationship with humans Two small emus and other animals outside Ch√¢teau de Malmaison The emus of King Island were first recorded by Europeans when a party from the ship Lady Nelson, led by the Scottish explorer John Murray, visited the island in January 1802. The bird was sporadically mentioned by travellers henceforward, but not in detail. Captain Nicolas Baudin visited King Island later in 1802, during an 1800‚Äì04 French expedition to map the coast of Australia. Two ships, Le Naturaliste and Le G√©ographe, were part of the expedition, which also brought along naturalists who described the local wildlife. Fran√ßois P√©ron, a naturalist who was part of Baudin's expedition, visited King Island and was the last person to record descriptions of the King Island emu from the wild. At one point, P√©ron and some of his companions became stranded due to storms and took refuge with some seal hunters. They were served emu meat, which P√©ron described in favourable terms as tasting halfway \\"between that of the turkey-cock and that of the young pig\\". P√©ron did not report seeing any emus on the island himself, which might explain why he described them as being the size of mainland birds. Instead, most of what is known about the King Island emu today stems from a 33-point questionnaire that he used to interview a local English sealer, Daniel Cooper, about the bird. In accordance with a request by the authorities for the expedition to bring back useful plants and animals, P√©ron asked if the emus could be bred and fattened in captivity, and received a variety of cooking recipes. P√©ron's questionnaire remained unpublished until 1899, and very little was therefore known about the bird in life until then. =Transported specimens= Skeleton in the Royal Zoological Museum, Florence, with reconstructed bones Several emu specimens belonging to the different subspecies were sent to France, both live and dead, as part of the expedition. Some of these exist in European museums today. Le Naturaliste brought one live specimen and one skin of the mainland emu to France in June 1803. Le G√©ographe collected emus from both King and Kangaroo Island, and at least two live King Island individuals, assumed to be a male and female by some sources, were taken to France in March 1804. This ship also brought skins of five juveniles collected from different islands. Two of these skins, of which the provenance is unknown, are presently kept in Paris and Turin; the rest are lost. In addition to rats, cockroaches, and other inconveniences aboard the ships, the emus were incommoded by the rough weather which caused the ships to shake violently; some died as a result, while others had to be force fed so they did not starve to death. In all, Le G√©ographe brought 73 live animals of various species back to France. The two individuals brought to France were first kept in captivity in the menagerie of Empress Josephine, and were moved to the Jardin des Plantes after a year. The \\"female\\" died in April 1822, and its skin is now mounted in the Mus√©um national d'Histoire naturelle of Paris. The \\"male\\" died in May 1822, and is preserved as a skeleton in the same museum. A feather of the Paris skin was given to the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, the only confirmed feather belonging to this subspecies currently in Australia. The Paris skin contains several bones, but not the pelvis, which is an indicator of sex, so the supposed female identity is unconfirmed. P√©ron noted that the small emus brought to France were distinct from those of the mainland, but not that they were distinct from each other, or which island each had come from, so their provenance was unknown for more than a century later. Self portrait of Lesueur lying on a cage containing a bird There is also a skeleton in the Royal Zoological Museum, Florence, which it obtained from France in 1833, but was mislabelled as a cassowary and used by students until correctly identified by Italian zoologist Enrico Hillyer Giglioli in 1900. The skeleton is worn, and several elements are missing, some having been replaced with wooden copies (probably based on those of the Paris skeleton), including the pectoral girdle, the wings, and parts of the legs and skull. Its right metatarsus was damaged during life and had healed incorrectly. It was thought to be a male, but is now known to be a composite of two individuals. A fourth specimen was thought to be kept in the Liverpool Museum, but it may simply be a juvenile mainland emu. Apart from the King Island emu specimens brought to France, a few are also known to have been brought to mainland Australia in 1803, but their fate is unknown. =Contemporary depictions= 1807 plate by Lesueur, perhaps showing this subspecies on the right P√©ron's 1807, three-volume account of the expedition, Voyage de d√©couverte aux terres Australes, contains an illustration (plate 36) of \\"casoars\\" by Charles-Alexandre Lesueur, who was the resident artist during Baudin's voyage. The caption states the birds shown are from \\"Ile Decr√®s\\", the French name for Kangaroo Island, but there is confusion over what is actually depicted. The two adult birds are labelled as a male and female of the same species, surrounded by juveniles. The family-group shown is improbable, since breeding pairs of the mainland emu split up once the male begins incubating the eggs. Lesueur's preparatory sketches also indicate these may have been drawn after the captive birds in Jardin des Plantes, and not wild ones, which would have been harder to observe for extended periods. Preparatory sketches for the 1807 plate The Australian museum curator, Stephanie Pfennigwerth, has instead proposed that the larger, light-ruffed \\"male\\" was actually drawn after a captive Kangaroo Island emu, that the smaller, dark \\"female\\" is a captive King Island emu, that the scenario is fictitious, and the sexes of the birds indeterminable. They may instead only have been assumed to be male and female of the same species due to their difference in size. A crooked claw on the \\"male\\" has also been interpreted as evidence that it had lived in captivity, and it may also indicate that the depicted specimen is identical to the Kangaroo Island emu skeleton in Paris, which has a deformed toe. The juvenile on the right may have been based on the Paris skin of an approximately five- month-old emu specimen (from either King or Kangaroo Island), which may in turn be the individual that died on board le Geographe during rough weather, and was presumably stuffed there by Lesueur himself. The chicks may instead simply have been based on those of mainland emus, as none are known to have been collected. =Extinction= 1807 plate by Lesueur showing elephant seals and sealers (middle left) on King Island The exact cause for the extinction of the King Island emu is unknown. Soon after the bird was discovered, sealers settled on the island because of the abundance of elephant seals. P√©ron's interview with Daniel Cooper suggested that they likely contributed to the demise of the bird by hunting it, and perhaps by starting fires. P√©ron described how dogs were purpose-trained to hunt down the emus; Cooper even claimed to have killed no fewer than 300 emus himself. Cooper had been on the island for six months, which suggests he killed 50 birds a month. His group of sealers consisted of eleven men as well as his wife, and they alone may have killed 3,600 emus by the time P√©ron visited them. P√©ron explained that the sealers consumed an enormous quantity of meat, and that their dogs killed several animals each day. He also observed such hunting dogs being released on Kangaroo Island, and mused that they might wipe out the entire population of kangaroos there in some years, but he did not express the same sentiment about the emus of King Island. Based on the possibly restricted distribution of the emu to coastal areas, Hume and colleagues suggested this might explain their rapid disappearance, as these areas were easily accessible to sealers. Natural fires may also have played a role. It is probable that the two captive birds in France, which died in 1822, outlived their wild fellows on King Island, and were therefore the last of their kind. Though P√©ron stated King Island \\"swarmed\\" with emus in 1802, they may have become extinct in the wild as early as 1805. They were certainly extinct by 1836, when some English settlers arrived on the island. Elephant seals disappeared from the island around 1819 due to over-hunting. In 1967, when the King Island emu was still thought to be only known from prehistoric remains, the American ornithologist James Greenway questioned whether they could have been exterminated by a few natives, and speculated that fires started by prehistoric men or lightning may have been responsible. At this time, the mainland emu was also threatened by overhunting, and Greenway cautioned that it could end up sharing the fate of its island relatives if no measures were taken in time.

Berg's clients have included Walt Disney World, Lexus, Procter & Gamble, Major League Baseball, the NHL, and the San Francisco Opera.Worlds Tallest Structure of Playing Cards He also participated in a music video by The Bravery, playing a lonely man who builds a fantasy world out of cards. = World's tallest house of cards = Berg first broke the world record for the world's tallest house of free-standing playing cards in 1992 at the age of seventeen, with a tower tall. Since then, Berg has been commissioned to break his own Guinness Record approximately ten times. He built another tower in the College of Design's atrium at Iowa State University in 1998. It stood at approximately tall and used over 1500 decks of standard cards weighing over . It took two and a half weeks to build working in shifts from four to twelve hours each day. During construction, the tower was surrounded by scaffolding. On November 6, 1999, Berg built a taller tower for the German edition of Guinness Prime Time in the lobby of the casino at Potsdamer Platz, Berlin. That tower was approximately tall and required over 1700 decks to stack up to 131 stories. Berg's most recent record was a 25-foot 9 7/16 inch tall tower built at the African-American Museum at Fair Park in Dallas, Texas. For this record, he tried a new technique involving stacking cards vertically instead of horizontally, which reduced the number of cards needed by nearly half. On September 18, 2009, on Live with Regis & Kelly, Berg attempted to break the Guinness World Record for tallest free-standing card structure in 60 minutes. As Berg stopped building the structure when time ran out, the cards fell down, costing him his bid for a new world record. = World's largest house of cards = In 2004, Guinness created a record category for the world's largest house of free-standing playing cards to recognize a project Berg built for Walt Disney World, a replica of Cinderella's Castle.Bryan Berg  In the Spotlight  Area of Design In 2010, Berg exceeded his own record by using over 218,000 cards to construct a replica of the Venetian Macao, which took 44 days.www.venetianmacaohouseofcards.com = Technique = In 2006, Berg used an adhesive for the first time on one of his projects. The structure, a re-creation of the \\"Fabulous Las Vegas\\" sign, was created for Loctite with the adhesive brand's Loctite Control Gel Super Glue. The sign was displayed during the 2006 World Series of Poker in Las Vegas.  Notability  Berg's work has had extensive media coverage. He has appeared on CNN, The Today Show, Good Morning America,Decked Out in Times Square to Support Tsunami Victims - ABC News and various other United States and international TV shows. His work has been featured in US newspapers and publications such as Wired, Reader's Digest \\"Best of America\\" Issue,http://www.rd.com/your-america-inspiring-people-and-stories/best-of- america-video/article37341.html Men's Health,House of Cards  Men's Health and Time Magazine for Kids. Berg also appeared in the video for \\"Time Won't Let Me Go\\" by The Bravery. Berg published a book with Simon & Schuster, Stacking The Deck, as a how-to about some of his techniques and structures.  Personal life  Born in Spirit Lake, Iowa, Berg now lives with his wife in Santa Fe, New Mexico.  Fetch! With Ruff Ruffman  Berg was featured on the PBS game show, Fetch! With Ruff Ruffman on season 3. He was given the task to teach the Fetchers how to build a house of cards.

Background  The Commonwealth Prisoners Act,Commonwealth Prisoners Act 1967 (Cth). provided for a non-parole period, which differed depending on which State the prisoner was convicted in. The claim was that the Act authorised the unequal treatment of Commonwealth offenders.  Decision  Mason CJ, Dawson and McHugh JJ denied that the Constitution contained an implied right to substantive legal equality, and only recognised procedural inequality. Deane and Toohey JJ found an implied right substantive equality, and while Gaudron and Brennan JJ did not agree with Deane and Toohey JJ, they did not disagree either. However, Brennan J did not agree that the right had been violated, and thus there was a majority for the outcome that the Act was not invalid. The basis for the implied right of substantive equality (as advocated by Deane and Toohey JJ) comes from the fact that the constitution is a free agreement between the people of the colonies, and these pre-existing rights continued after federation. In the absence of words that deny such equality, these pre- existing rights should continue to exist. This notion of equality is said to be vested in the courts as created in Chapter III of the Constitution, and these courts are to treat them \\"fairly\\" and \\"impartially\\".

Contents  Exodus Rabbah is almost purely aggadic in character. It contains 52 sections. It consists of two sections with different styles, dubbed \\"Exodus Rabbah I\\" (sections 1-14, covering Exodus chapters 1-10) and \\"Exodus Rabbah II\\" (sections 15-52), which were written separately and later joined.Encyclopaedia Judaica, Exodus Rabbah Leopold Zunz ascribes the composition of the entire work to the 11th or 12th century; although, immediately following Bereshit Rabbah in the collection of the rabbot, it \\"is separated from the latter by 500 years\\".G. V. p. 256 It was first quoted by Azriel of Gerona and then by Nachmanides, placing its composition no later than the early 13th century.Midrash Shemot Rabbah, Anat Raizel Various modern scholars place its composition in the 10th to 12th centuries. =Exodus Rabbah I= In sections 1-14 the proems are almost invariably followed by the running commentary on the entire seder or other Scriptural division (the beginnings of the sedarim are distinguished by an asterisk): * Section 1, on *Exodus 1:1-2:25; * Sections 2 and 3, on *Exodus 3:1-4:17; * Sections 4 and 5 (Nos. 2-8), on *Exodus 4:18-26; * Section 5 (Nos. 1, 9-23), on Exodus 4:27-6:1; * Section 6, on *Exodus 6:2-12; * Section 7, on Exodus 6:13 et seq.; * Section 8, on Exodus 7:1 et seq. (a Tanhuma homily); * Section 9, on *Exodus 7:8-25; * Section 10, on Exodus 7:26-8:15; * Section 11, on *Exodus 8:16-9:12; * Section 12, on Exodus 9:13-35; * Section 13, on *Exodus 10:1-20; * Section 14, on Exodus 10:21-29 There is no exposition, nor (in the Tanhuma midrashim) any homily, to *Exodus 11:1. The assumption is justified that Shemot Rabbah down to Exodus 12:1, with which section the Mekhilta begins, is based on an earlier exegetical midrash, perhaps constituting the continuation of Bereshit Rabbah. This would explain the fact that in Exodus Rabbah I there are several sections to the open and closed Scripture sections, and that several expressions recall the terminology of the tannaitic midrash. =Exodus Rabbah II= Beginning with section 15, Exodus Rabbah contains homilies and homiletical fragments to the first verses of the Scripture sections. Many of the homilies are taken from the Tan·∏•umas, though sections 15, 16-19, 20, 30, and others show that the author had access also to homilies in many other sources. In the printed editions the text is sometimes abbreviated and the reader referred to such collections, as well as to the Pesikta Rabbati; in section 39 the entire exposition of the Pesikta Rabbati lesson Ki Tissa (Exodus 30:11) has been eliminated in this fashion. Such references and abbreviations were doubtless made by later copyists. There is an interesting statement in section 44 regarding the manner of treating a proem-text from the Psalms for the homily to Exodus 32:13.

In 1992, four band members ‚Äì Matthew Schaeffer, Cliff Hammer, and Tony Krug ‚Äì started writing and performing songs while they were still in high school. They graduated and went their separate ways for a while until moving to Madison, Wisconsin, in 1995. In 1997 while performing at Chicago's Beatlefest, they were discovered by Chicago record producer Joey Donatello. He developed the band and got their first album, Burlap and Broadcast, released in 1997. Their career and time together were short lived.  Early history  Beginning in 1992, Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, high school classmates Matthew Schaeffer, Cliff Hammer, and Tony Krug (a.k.a. Anthony) began writing and performing songs together. Under the moniker J.J. War, the band wrote and performed original songs. In 1994 after graduating high school, Schaeffer moved to Madison to study piano performance and composition at the University of Wisconsin, under Professor Carrol Chilton. Hammer and Krug remained in Fond du Lac. The band members all moved to Madison the following year, living together and writing songs. In 1997, they traveled to Chicago to perform in the city's annual BeatleFest.. Retrieved 2012-11-13. The resulting publicity brought the band to the attention of Chicago record producer Joey \\"The Don\\" Donatello, who developed the band and was responsible for their first album, Burlap and Broadcast, released in 1997. The band then relocated to Chicago to gain wider exposure in the local club scene.  Big break and subsequent parting  In 2000, Monovox earned a $250,000 recording contract through the internet record label GarageBand.com. The highest user-rated song out of thousands of recordings submitted to the Garageband.com website, \\"First Time\\" (which was penned by Schaeffer and later lyricized by Shaw) was soon re-recorded in Sausalito, California, with Jerry Harrison as producer. This song, along with twelve additional tracks that the band would record, would become the group's first and only full-length album as Monovox. Garageband dissolved with the dot-com bust of 2001, and the self-titled album was not released until much later, under the band's own \\"Ask A Chimp\\" label. In the years that followed, Schaeffer continued writing, touring, and recording songs with the band until March 2004, when Schaeffer and fellow Monovox guitarist Paulie Heenan (who had joined the group in 2001) announced that they were leaving the band to move to Manhattan, so that they might pursue music careers there. Hammer now performs with several Madison-area bands, and Shaw has occasionally and acoustically performed solo in Madison. Shaw graduated from the University of Wisconsin- Madison with a BA during the spring of 2004.  Death  Paulie Heenan died on November 9, 2012, in Madison, at the age of 30. He was shot by police during an altercation after apparently being mistaken for a burglar after a night of drinking and entering the wrong house by mistake.

Around 1048 Henry married Mathilda of Verdun (born abt 1025, died 27 July 1060), daughter of Duke Gozelo of Lotharingia, and sister of pope Stephen IX. He received the Mosellan castle of Cochem from his niece, Queen Richeza of Poland.Niederrheins Urkundenbuch, vol. I, 186, p. 117.

It is based on the 1902 novel of the same title by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It stars Peter Cushing as Sherlock Holmes, Sir Christopher Lee as Sir Henry Baskerville and Andr√© Morell as Doctor Watson. It is the first film adaptation of the novel to be filmed in colour. Plot Dr. Richard Mortimer asks Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson to investigate the death of his friend Sir Charles Baskerville, in Dartmoor, found dead by heart failure, lying in the moor surrounding his estate, Baskerville Hall. Mortimer believes that his good friend had been scared to death by the vision of a ghost hound, the same that centuries before killed his ancestor, the devilish Sir Hugo. Mortimer also fears for the life of Sir Henry, who's just come from South Africa to take possession of his inheritance and of Baskerville Hall. Although skeptical, Holmes and Watson accept to meet Sir Henry, who is apparently young and bold. A series of peculiar incidents soon convince Holmes that Sir Henry's life is indeed in danger, and, busy with a prior commitment, he chooses to dispatch his trustworthy friend Watson to Dartmoor with Mortimer and Sir Henry. Before parting, Holmes reminds Watson not to let Sir Henry go out onto the nearby moor after dark. On their way to Baskerville Hall, the trio is warned by the coach driver Perkins that a convict named Selden (Michael Mulcaster) has escaped from nearby Dartmoor Prison and is hiding on the moor; Selden was convicted of murdering prostitutes and sentenced to life-imprisonment after being declared insane. At Baskerville Hall, Sir Henry gets acquainted with his new house, helped by the butler, Mr. Barrymore, and his wife. On the walls stand the portraits of the previous masters of the house, including infamous Sir Hugo. However, a second portrait of Sir Hugo is missing, and the Barrymores are unable to offer any explanation. The next day, Sir Henry and Watson meet the friendly local pastor, Bishop Frankland, who is also a keen entomologist. While crossing the moor after visiting the post office in the nearby village, Watson gets lost in a wetland called Grimpen Mire and gets trapped in a patch of quicksand. Two people come to help, a farmer named Stapleton and his daughter Cecile, a beautiful and wild girl who immediately bewitches Sir Henry. One night, Watson sees a light in the moor. He and Sir Henry go out to investigate, but a strange man rushes by in the shadows, then a distant hound howls, upsetting Sir Henry so much that he faints. Watson spots a figure silhouetted on a hill in the distance, while he helps Sir Henry back to Baskerville Hall. Soon, Watson discovers that the silhouetted figure was Holmes, who has concealed his own arrival to investigate more freely. Together, Holmes and Watson find the corpse of the convict Selden, slaughtered on the moor by an unknown beast, while wearing clothes belonging to Sir Henry. This clue exposes the Barrymores, who confess to have helped the escapee, who was their relative, by supplying food and other provisions each time he signaled with a light from his hideout. However, Holmes has evidence that neither the Barrymores nor Selden are connected to the death of Sir Charles, so he keeps on searching for clues to confirm the existence of the mysterious hound and the identity of its masters. Facing personal danger in an abandoned copper mine, and thanks to the stolen portrait of Sir Hugo, Holmes is able to guess who unleashed the hound in pursue of Sir Charles and why they did it. The detective and his assistant decide to set a trap for the murderers in the same place where, according to the legend, the ghost hound had killed Sir Hugo. Unfortunately, to make the trap work they will need to put Sir Henry's life at great risk...

Critical reception Peter Cushing's Holmes received good reviews at the time, with Films and Filming calling him an \\"impish, waspish, Wilde-ian Holmes\\", while the New York Herald Tribune stated \\"Peter Cushing is a forceful and eager Sherlock Holmes\\". Andr√© Morell's Watson has been praised for his far more accurate rendition of the character as envisioned by Arthur Conan Doyle, as opposed to the comical buffoon created by Nigel Bruce. A negative review in the Monthly Film Bulletin stated that \\"any freshly entertaining possibilities in this much-filmed story have here been lost in a welter of blood, love interest and mood music\\".

The first part of the 100-page-long book is devoted to the early history of the abbey, from its foundation by Henry the Bearded in 1227 until 1259. The second part includes the later history until 1310. In the record for 1270 a settler from the nearby village is reported to have said to his wife \\"Day, ut ia pobrusa, a ti poziwai\\", which could be roughly translated as \\"Let me, I shall grind, and you take a rest\\". The circumstances under which this sentence was written closely reflected the cultural and literary conditions in Poland in the first centuries of its national existence. It appeared in a Latin chronicle, written by a German abbot. The man who reportedly uttered the sentence almost one hundred years earlier was Bogwal, a Czech (Bogwalus Boemus), a local settler and subject of Boles≈Çaw the Tall, as he felt compassion for his local wife, who \\"very often stood grinding by the quern-stone\\".

She was an honor student and member of Law Enforcement Explorers Post 111 who hoped to be a police officer.. =Wounded= *Shelley Schaberg, 17, was described by the principal as the school's best female athlete. Voted Miss Heath High School by the senior class, Shelley was homecoming queen. Though her injuries from the shooting prevented her from playing basketball, her college honored her basketball scholarship and she went on to play college soccer. *Melissa \\"Missy\\" Jenkins, 15, was president of the Future Homemakers of America. She was paralyzed after being shot in the chest. Missy has appeared on numerous national and local television shows, talked to newspaper reporters and is appearing in two TV commercials for Channel One News, an educational channel that reaches schools throughout the country. A video interview of her was featured on the homepage of YouTube.com on April 22, 2007.. *Kelly Hard Alsip, 16, was a member of the softball team and the Future Homemakers of America. She transferred to the local Catholic school the year after the shooting. *Hollan Holm, 14, was a member of the Academic Team, the Spanish Club, and the Science Olympiad. In his valedictory speech at the class of 2001 graduation, he reminded his class that they had lost not one but two class members on December 1, 1997: Nicole Hadley and Michael Carneal. Holm has been involved with an organization that urges students to speak up if they know of threats against schools or students. *Craig Keene, 15, was a member of the Agape Club, the band, and the basketball team. Perpetrator Michael Adam Carneal (born July 1, 1983) was a 14-year old freshman at the time of the shooting. Carneal told reporters that he couldn't give a single explanation for his crimes, and that contributing factors included a mistaken belief that his parents didn't love him, taunting from classmates, and false claims he was gay. He also stated that he didn't know who he was aiming at until he read the names in the paper. Weeks before the incident, Carneal stole a .38 caliber handgun from his parents' room and attempted to sell it. A student took the gun, threatening to tell police if Carneal did not give it to him. Additionally, Carneal had told students that \\"something big is going to happen on Monday\\" but no one took him seriously. In the weeks before the shooting, Carneal stole several firearms from both his own home and a neighbor's home. On the afternoon of Thanksgiving Day, Carneal went to his neighbor's home and broke into the garage, taking\\" *Four .22 rifles *A 30-30 rifle *.22 and 12 gauge ammunition *Earplugs Later, he also stole: *A Ruger .22 pistol *Several .22 magazines Presumably sometime after Thanksgiving Day, Carneal stole two shotguns from his father's closet and hid them under his bed. = Mental illness = According to reports, Carneal had been bullied by other students and suffered from anxiety, depression, and severe paranoia. His paranoia was manifested in habits such as covering up vents and windows while in bathrooms, because he believed he was being watched.. Following the shooting, Carneal was diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder and dysthymia. Kathleen O'Connor, who treated Carneal while he was incarcerated at the Northern Kentucky Youth Development Center, initially agreed with this diagnosis but later determined that Carneal actually had paranoid schizophrenia. Dewey Cornell and Diane Schetky, who evaluated Carneal after the shooting, later changed their diagnosis to schizophrenia. He has been hospitalized several times since the start of his incarceration due to psychosis, and takes the anti-depressant Zoloft and Geodon, an anti-psychotic used to treat schizophrenia. = Stephen King = Carneal had in his locker at the time a copy of Stephen King's novel Rage (first published in 1977 under the pseudonym Richard Bachman). After this shooting, King requested his publisher to allow it to go out of print, fearing that it might inspire similar tragedies. Rage for a time continued to be available in the United Kingdom in The Bachman Books collection, although the collection now no longer contains Rage.  Trial  In October 1998, Judge Jeff Hines accepted a plea of guilty from Michael Carneal, due to his mental illness. Under a plea arrangement, the judge agreed to accept the pleas on condition that Carneal would receive a life sentence with the possibility of parole in 25 years (2023). According to prosecutor Tim Kaltenbach, the plea allows Carneal to receive mental health treatment during imprisonment as long as this is necessary for him or until he is released. Carneal was transported to the Kentucky State Reformatory in La Grange when he turned 18 where he remains. Prior to that he was held in at Northern Kentucky Youth Development Center, a Kentucky Department of Juvenile Justice facility in Crittenden. Carneal's Kentucky Department of Corrections (KDOC) ID is 151127. Carneal began serving time with KDOC on June 1, 2001.\\"Carneal, Michael A.\\" Kentucky Department of Corrections. Retrieved on December 2, 2015. In 2007, Carneal filed an appeal claiming that he was too mentally ill to plead guilty in 1998 to the shooting at Heath High School and asked the Kentucky Supreme Court for a re-trial. Prosecutors appealed and the Kentucky Supreme Court rejected his request and Carneal will continue to serve out his sentence. In 2012, he attempted to withdraw his plea claiming he was mentally ill at the time he made it, later in the year the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals denied the request stating he should have acted sooner. = Settlement for families = The families of the deceased have agreed to a $42 million settlement from Carneal, however at the time of settlement Carneal had no assets and his family's insurance company, Kentucky Farm Bureau, has insisted repeatedly through court motions that it is not liable for his actions. Lawsuit In early 1999, the parents of three victims represented by Jack Thompson filed a $33 million lawsuit against two Internet pornography sites, several computer game companies and makers and distributors of the 1994 film Natural Born Killers and the 1995 film The Basketball Diaries. They claimed that media violence inspired Carneal and therefore should be held responsible for the deaths that occurred. The case was dismissed in 2002. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that it was \\"simply too far a leap from shooting characters on a video screen to shooting people in a classroom.\\" The same year, an identical case was brought against the same companies by the family of the teacher killed in the Columbine High School massacre. It was dismissed in 2002. Both Thompson and United States Attorney General John Ashcroft claimed Carneal's proficient marksmanship was due to practice in violent video games. Memorials Family of victims organized a 20th anniversary service to commemorate the victims, and open a memorial for the victims placed across the street from the school. The memorial was built in a circle to symbolize the prayer circle that was targeted, with five benches representing the five surviving victims.

Plinthite is a redoximorphic feature in highly weathered soil. The product of pedogenesis, it commonly occurs as dark red redox concretions that usually form platy, polygonal, or reticulate patterns. Plinthite changes irreversibly to an ironstone hardpan or to irregular soil aggregates on exposure to repeated wetting and drying, especially if it is also exposed to heat from the sun. The lower boundary of a zone in which plinthite occurs generally is diffuse or gradual, but it may be abrupt at a lithologic discontinuity. Generally, plinthite forms in a soil horizon that is saturated with water for some time during the year. Initially, iron is normally segregated in the form of soft, more or less clayey, red or dark red redox concretions. These concretions are not considered plinthite unless there has been enough segregation of iron to permit their irreversible hardening on exposure to repeated wetting and drying. Plinthite is firm or very firm when the soil moisture content is near field capacity and hard when the moisture content is below the permanent wilting point. Plinthite concretions are coherent enough to be separated readily from the surrounding soil. Plinthite commonly occurs within and above reticulately mottled horizons. The part of the iron-rich body that is not plinthite normally stains the fingers when rubbed while wet, but the plinthite center does not. It has a harsh, dry feel when rubbed, even if wet. Plinthite does not harden irreversibly as a result of a single cycle of drying and rewetting. After a single drying, it will remoisten and then can be dispersed in large part if one shakes it in water with a dispersing agent. In a moist soil, plinthite is soft enough to be cut with a spade. After irreversible hardening, it is no longer considered plinthite but is called ironstone. Indurated ironstone materials can be broken or shattered with a spade but cannot be dispersed if one shakes them in water with a dispersing agent.

Description Pelvis It is known from subfossil bones and the 1708 description of Leguat as well as the 1726 report of Julien Tafforet. Leguat's description was as follows: A traveler named M. Dubois, staying at the island from 1669 to 1672, described them as grey birds with white spots on each feather and green legs. However this could also refer to the dimorphic egret (Egretta dimorpha). Behaviour and ecology Both authors agree that this bittern-like bird, the size of a fat chicken or small egret, was mainly terrestrial, unwary, and only flew when chased, although even in that case they initially tried to escape by running. They apparently laid greenish eggs; one of their favorite foods was geckos, probably the Rodrigues day gecko as the other local species, the Rodrigues giant day gecko was nearly as long as the bird itself (both gecko species are nowadays extinct too). Analysis of the fossil remains concluded that the bill of the species was very strong (hence the name megacephalus, i.e. \\"large-headed\\") and that it was evolving towards flightlessness. Many other species endemic to Rodrigues became extinct after humans arrived, and the island's ecosystem is heavily damaged. Before humans arrived, forests covered the island entirely, but very little remains today. The Rodrigues night heron lived alongside other recently extinct birds, such as the Rodrigues solitaire, Rodrigues parrot, Newton's parakeet, Rodrigues rail, Rodrigues owl, Rodrigues starling, and the Rodrigues pigeon. Extinct reptiles include the domed Rodrigues giant tortoise, the saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise, and the Rodrigues day gecko. Extinction alt=Map of Rodrigues, decorated with solitaires The bird appears to have been hunted to extinction in the mid-18th century. Pingr√© mentions in his report that no \\"bitterns\\" could be found on Rodrigues anymore in 1761.

The majority of the Bench found that the 1918 Ordinance was beneficial in intent and had neither the purpose of genocide nor that of restricting the practise of religion. The High Court unanimously held there was no separate action for a breach of any constitutional right.  Background  Indigenous Australians have lived in the Northern Territory for at least 40,000 years. In 1863 the Territory came under the control of South Australia which in 1910 passed the Northern Territory Aboriginals Act 1910.. The Act claimed to be for the \\"Protection and Control\\" of the Aboriginal people of the Territory. Under the Act, the \\"Chief Protector of Aboriginals\\" was appointed as the legal guardian of every child whose mother was Aboriginal, and had the power to confine such children to a reserve or Aboriginal institution. That is, indigenous children could be removed by Administrative order, whereas non-Indigenous children at the time could only be removed by order of a Court. This policy of removing indigenous children from their family continued when control of the Northern Territory was transferred from South Australia to the federal government.. The Aboriginals Ordinance 1918 extended these powers, putting Aboriginal females under the total control of the Chief Protector. Most of the Aboriginal institutions were operated by churches. From 1964 indigenous children could only be removed under the same circumstances as non-Indigenous children, however, the conditions of life for Indigenous people put them at greater risk of having their children removed on the ground of neglect or destitution. In 1971 97% of Territory children in foster care were Indigenous. In 1997 the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission published the Bringing Them Home report on its inquiry into the separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families. The report made a range of recommendations, including apologies from governments, churches and charities involved, the payment of monetary compensation and that the federal government legislate to implement the Genocide Convention with full domestic effect. =Argument in the High Court= The plaintiffs were seeking compensation from the Commonwealth for wrongful imprisonment and deprivation of liberty. For seven of the plaintiffs, Alec Kruger, Hilda Muir, Connie Cole, Peter Hansen, Kim Hill, George Ernest Bray, Janet Zita Wallace and Marjorie Foster, the claim was based on their removal from their families while they were children between 1925 and 1944. The claim of the eighth plaintiff, Rosie Napangardi McClary, was based on her being a mother whose daughter had been removed. One of the barriers for members of the Stolen Generations obtaining compensation was that their removal was authorised by the 1918 Ordinance, a barrier the plaintiffs sought to remove by challenging the legality of the ordinance. (1998) 24 Monash University Law Review 486. In the High Court the plaintiffs argued that the ordinance was invalid because it # infringed the doctrine of separation of powers; # offended the common law doctrine of legal equality; # restricted their freedom of movement and association; # the removal of children constituted genocide; and # Removal prevented children from the free exercise of their religion.  Decision  =Separation of power= The plaintiffs argument involved two propositions, that judicial power could only be exercised by a Chapter III Court, Judicial power and Courts. and that the removal and detention of people was exclusively a judicial power. That the federal judicial power could only be exercised by a court followed the 1915 decision of the High Court in New South Wales v Commonwealth (The Wheat Case), that the structure of the Constitution required the strict insulation of judicial power such that only a court established under Chapter III of the constitution can exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth.. The reasoning in the Wheat Case was taken further in Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia v J W Alexander Ltd where a majority of judges, Griffith CJ, Barton, Isaacs, Powers and Rich JJ, held that the power to enforce awards, being convictions for offences and the imposition of penalties and punishments, were matters appertaining exclusively to judicial power. at p. 444 per Griffiths CJ, pp. 454‚Äì5 per Barton J, p. 463 per Isaacs & Rich JJ and p. 481 per Powers J. The High Court reinforced the doctrine in the Boilermakers' Case, holding that only a Chapter III Court could exercise judicial powers and that a Chapter III Court was only permitted to exercise judicial power.. It had previously been held however that the territories were not a part of that federal judicial power.. Authority for the second proposition came from Chu Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigration,. where Brennan CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ said \\"The involuntary detention of a citizen in custody by the State is penal or punitive in character and, under our system of government, exists only as an incident of the exclusively judicial function of adjudging and punishing criminal guilt. All judges dismissed the separation of powers argument, their reasons differed. Brennan CJ, Dawson and McHugh JJ held that the separation of powers doctrine did not apply to the power to make laws for a territory under section 122 of the Constitution and thus did not decide whether detention was a judicial power. Brennan CJ held that the territories were not part of the federal system that involved the distribution of powers between the Commonwealth and the States. Dawson J, McHugh J agreeing, held that section 122 of the Constitution permitted the Parliament to create courts that were not federal courts and not exercising federal jurisdiction. Dawson J doubted that the actions were of a judicial rather than an executive character. Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ held that the removal of Indigenous children was not the exercise of judicial power and did not decide whether the separation of powers doctrine applied. Toohey J held that the proposition that the separation of powers doctrine extended to the territories was very persuasive, however his Honour did not determine the question on that basis because \\"judged by the values and standards prevailing at the time\\" the Ordinance had a welfare purpose and thus were neither puniative nor the exercise of judicial power. Gaudron J similarly based her decision on the finding that the power to authorise detention in custody was not exclusively judicial power. Gummow J held that at the time the detention was seen as necessary for a legitimate non-punitive purpose and was not the exercise of judicial power. = Implied right of legal equality = The plaintiffs sought remedies consistent with the dissenting judgements of Deane and Toohey JJ, and Gaudron J in a separate judgment in Leeth v Commonwealth,. However, in this case only Toohey J held there was a right of substantive equality; Gaudron J departed from her position in Leeth to support procedural equality only. Gaudron J was accompanied by Dawson, McHugh and Gummow JJ. Brennan CJ did not consider this issue, as he found that such a right could not apply to the territories, as they were creations of parliament. Per Dawson J, the due process afforded by the existence of Chapter III courts is of a \\"procedural rather than substantive nature\\". As for the existence of discrimination in the Constitution, he disagreed with the notion that because there were provisions protecting the States from discriminatory Commonwealth laws,. there should be applicable laws for individuals, on the basis that these protections were founded on different considerations. Furthermore, where the Constitution has prescribed equality, it has done so explicitly, such as the section 92 prohibition against discrimination of a protectionist kind. However, he recognised that Deane and Toohey JJ based their doctrine of equality on \\"considerations of a more fundamental kind\\". Dawson J also attacked the notion that legal equality might arise from the Constitution as a free agreement of the people; he noted that there was a degree of equality lacking, with regards to women and Aboriginals. In relation to the common law, even if there were a common law right of substantive equality, the Commonwealth parliament has the ability to usurp the common law otherwise its concurrent power will be less than that of the States. Finally, even with the existence of Chapter III courts, it is not possible to declare a law invalid because it is substantively unequal. =Freedom of movement and association= The claim for freedom of movement was not based on the express right such as the freedom of interstate commercial travel, Trade within the Commonwealth to be free. but rather an implied right flowing from the implied freedom of political communication, a freedom that may be subject to limitations that are reasonably appropriate and adapted to serve a legitimate end.. Toohey, Gaudron, and McHugh JJ held that association and movement were inherent in political communication such that there was an implied freedom of movement and association. Toohey J held that considering the standards and perceptions prevailing at the time of the 1918 Ordinance, it was not necessarily invalid. McHugh J held that the right was intimately connected with voting, and because the people of the Northern Territory, whether indigenous or not, could not vote at that time, freedom of movement did not apply to people in the Northern Territory. Gaudron J was the only judge to have held that any part of the 1918 Ordinance was invalid, holding that sections 6, 16 and 67(1)(c) were invalid as they were not necessary for the attainment of some overriding purpose. These were the sections that permitted the Chief Protector to take children into custody, and to confine them to a reserve or Aboriginal institution. Brennan CJ and Dawson J did not decide whether or not there was an implied freedom of movement and association. Brennan CJ held that the provisions were not directed to impeding political communication and so were not invalid. Dawson J held that because people in a Territory did not have the right to vote, there was no right for freedom of movement to attach to. Gummow J took the narrowest interpretation, holding that there was not a right to freedom of movement and familial association, and even if such rights existed, the 1918 Ordinance did not infringe them. =Freedom from genocide= The Bringing Them Home report had found that the removal of Indigenous children was genocide, as defined in the Genocide Convention which was ratified by Australia in 1949,. but has not been implemented with legislation in Australia. Article 2 of the Genocide Convention defines genocide as acts committed with intent to destroy a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, including: A majority of the High Court, Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ, found that the 1918 Ordinance required action to be taken in the best interests of the Aboriginal people and thus did not authorise genocide. Thus is, if genocidal acts occurred, they were beyond the power given by the 1918 Ordinance. Gaudron J went further and held that genocide was so fundamentally abhorrent that the Australian Parliament did not have the Constitutional power to make laws authorising acts of genocide. Her Honour was however the only judge to find a right to freedom from genocide. Dawson J, in addition to holding that the 1918 Ordinance did not authorise genocide, held that section 122 of the Constitution is 'unlimited in terms of subject matter' in contrast to the heads of power under section 51. Therefore the proper construction of the section contains no restriction on legislative power, as the plaintiff argued. Gummow J agreed with this expansive interpretation of section 122. =Freedom of Religion= Section 116 of the Constitution states: > The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or > for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise > of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification > for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth. Commonwealth not to > legislate in respect of religion. The plaintiffs did not argue that making Aboriginal children attend a church run institution was the imposition of religious observance, but that the system of spiritual beliefs and practices of the Aboriginal people was a religion and the laws prohibited Aboriginal children from the free exercise of that religion by separating them from indigenous culture. The Bringing Them Home report had found that Aboriginal children were removed because their Aboriginality was 'a problem' and to prevent the children from acquiring Aboriginal 'habits', culture and traditions. This argument was rejected by the High Court, with the majority, Brennan CJ, Dawson J, Toohey J, and Gummow J, holding section 116 was directed to the purpose of a law and not to the effect of the law, and that the challenged laws did not have the purpose of restricting the practise of religion. held that none of the laws had that prohibited purpose. Gaudron J agreed with the majority that section 116 was directed to the purpose of the legislation, but that the purpose of the 1918 Ordinance could not be determined on the material before the High Court. Gummow J similarly left open the possibility that section 116 prohibited the use of concealed means or circuitous devices, but that would have to be established by evidence before a law could be found to be invalid. Aftermath The High Court upheld the validity of the 1918 Ordinance but that removal could only occur if it was considered as being best interests of the Aboriginal child, \\"judged by the values and standards prevailing at the time\\". In this way the Court left open the possibility that the removal of some Aboriginal children may not have been authorised by the 1918 Ordinance. Only one member of the Stolen Generations, Bruce Trevorrow in South Australia,. has obtained compensation as a result of litigation. (2011) 30 University of Tasmania Law Review 32.

It is ranked second among all the senior high schools in Taiwan, usually with a requirement of PR98 and above on the National Senior High School Entrance Exams. The campus is located in Da-an District in Taipei, Taiwan. History HSNU was founded in Taiwan as \\"Taipei Third State High School\\" in 1937 under Japanese rule. Until the end of World War II, ninety percent of the student body was Japanese. On December 5, 1945, the government of the Republic of China changed the school's name to \\"Taiwan Third Provincial High School\\" and then again on January 1, 1946, to \\"Taiwan Provincial Taipei He-ping High School.\\" Under the name \\"He-ping High School,\\" the school's purpose was to educate Japanese children who did not return to Japan; at the time, most of the teachers were Japanese. In 1947, China's political situation changed again. Government administrators' families who had lived in mainland China came to Taiwan, and the government let their children to study at He-ping High School. At that time, Taiwan Provincial Teachers' College (now National Taiwan Normal University) was preparing to establish an experimental high school as a teachers' training ground, so the college applied for the establishment of a new school. On August 1, 1947, He-ping High School became \\"The Affiliated Senior High School of Taiwan Provincial Teachers' College.\\" There was also a junior high school section. In October 1949, the school took in 310 students from the National Revolutionary Army's Children's School, the largest number taken by a school in that area. In 1955, the name of the governing teachers' college was changed to \\"Normal University.\\" In 1961, the junior high school section closed, and in 1967, the teachers' college changed names once again, from \\"Provincial\\" to \\"National;\\" thus, the high school's name became \\"The Affiliated High School of National Taiwan Normal University.\\" However, it was not until an associate professor of the NTNU's Education Department, Huang Zhen-Qiu, became HSNU's principal, were the high school and the university closely tied. The film Blue Gate Crossing portrays school life in HSNU. School features =Graduation ceremony= The annual graduation ceremony is an event organized and decorated solely by students that have been admitted into university. The team of students adorn the settings of ceremony to a theme, arrange the entertainment programs and shoot their own music videos. This event is reported by the mass media every year. =Uniform= Under Japanese rule, boys' high school uniforms in Taiwan were similar to military uniforms, khaki from top to bottom. In 1983, HSNU changed the uniform to a light blue button-down shirt with dark blue trousers. The girls' uniform was designed when girls started to enroll in the school's music program. The girls' uniform consisted of a white button-down shirt and a light blue suit skirt (with double folds down the front). The girls' uniform comes with an optional blazer jacket that matches the skirt. Most choose to wear the more comfortable black tracksuit jacket. =Experimental classes= In addition to normal classes, there have been experimental classes in HSNU. For example, between 1950 and 1961, HSNU tried a system with a four-year junior high school with two years of senior high school. The experimental science class was established in 1978 (Class 420 and Class 430 were created in the first year). In the year 2004, the Honors English Class (also known as, \\"English Experimental Class\\") was established. The first class was Senior High Class 1111. HSNU also take students from diplomatic families and foreign expats. =School anthem= HSNU's school anthem was composed during principal Huang's era by Shi Wei-Liang (Âè≤ÊÉü‰∫Æ, Music Teacher). The text, in Chinese, was written by Guo Tang (ÈÉ≠Ê©ñ, History Teacher) and Xiao Hui-Kai (Ëï≠ËºùÊ•∑, Compilation Leader).

Facts Between December 1990 and December 1991 Compass Airlines Pty Ltd (\\"Compass\\") carried on business as an Australian domestic airline. The business subsequently failed, and in December 1991 Compass went into provisional liquidation. The aircraft operated by Compass were leased from Canadian Airlines International Ltd. At the relevant time, the Civil Aviation Act 1988 contained provisions relating to the imposition of charges for services and facilities provided to airline operators. The legislation also created a statutory lien over aircraft to secure payment of such charges. At the time Compass went into provisional liquidation, it owed the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA, later \\"Airservices Australia\\") substantial amounts in respect of charges and penalties payable in respect of the operations of each of the leased aircraft. The CAA invoked its statutory liens. Each respondent paid, under protest, the charges and penalties claimed to be owing in respect of each aircraft. Upon receipt of those payments, the CAA discharged the liens it asserted. The amounts were paid pursuant to agreements which entitled the respondents to recover the moneys, together with interest, if it were to be held that, as against the respondents, the liens did not validly secure payment of the charges, or for any reason the liens, or the charges, or both, were, in whole or in part, illegal, void or unenforceable. In the Federal Court Canadian Airlines successfully contended that the charges contravened section 67 of the Act, in that they amounted to taxation. Airservices Australia subsequently appealed the decision. Decision The High Court held there was no discernible relationship between Airservices Australia and the services received by Canadian Airlines. The method of calculation meant the amount paid by Canadian Airlines was not in proportion to their use of the services. Expert testimony said that the method of calculation to establish the payments owed was the best possible allocation. As a consequence the court decided it was a fee and not a tax. The court held that there has to be a discernible relationship between the fee paid and the service provided, though they relaxed the requirement somewhat because the fee paid by Canadian Airlines was not in proportion to their use of services. There was however, a bona fide attempt to recover the costs, and it was the only way to spread the cost among the spectrum of airlines and users. Ultimately there is no need for actual correlation between services used and the charge imposed.

Founded in 1845, Tilton's student body in the 2017‚Äì18 academic year consisted of 51 day students and 192 boarding students from 20 states and 16 countries. History Tilton School, a boarding school in New Hampshire, was founded in 1845 by a group of local leaders and members of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Their goal was to promote literary and scientific knowledge among the youth. The school was originally named the New Hampshire Conference Seminary of the Methodist Episcopal Church and was located in the town of Northfield. In the first year of the school, the seminary's enrollment consisted of 130 students, (74 males, 56 females). Most students were from neighboring towns, but some traveled from as far as Vermont and Boston to attend the new Methodist school.The Builders of Tilton School: A Centennial Record. Fred Andrew Smart, 1945. Evans Printing Company. After a number of setbacks, including a fire that destroyed the first school building, the school moved across the Winnipesaukee River to its current location in Tilton.264x264pxLike many town academies in New England, Tilton School was a coeducational college preparatory boarding school with students from all over the world. It also served as the public high school for the towns of Northfield, Tilton and Sanbornton until 1939. During this time, students were able to choose a college preparatory or a general course of study. In addition to granting high school degrees, Tilton School awarded a number of other degrees, including college diplomas when the seminary included a women's college from 1852 to 1903. Tilton School also functioned as a junior college which awarded men their Associate Degree from 1936 until 1958. Tilton School had a lower and a middle school at different times in its early history. The biggest change in the school's history occurred in 1939: a local school district formed, and Tilton School no longer served as the towns' high school. Tilton also stopped accepting female students at this time. Tilton School was then an all-boys preparatory boarding school until 1970. During this period, the school underwent major changes, including the addition of a new gymnasium, library, chapel, dormitory, and the purchase of of land adjacent to campus. Tilton School's return to its coeducational roots in 1970 led to more changes. In subsequent years, two girls' dorms (Moore Hall and Maloney Hall) were built, and more academic and athletic facilities were added to campus. In 2013, Chris Burch, Class of 1972, announced at an all-school meeting that he would be donating $1.3 million for the construction of an artificial turf field on the Hill. This gift is the largest single donation in the school's history. Before the construction of Burch Field, all outdoor sports competitions were held at the Charles E. Tilton fields in Northfield.https://www.tiltonschool.org/page/news-detail?pk=680721 The construction of Burch Field was completed in 2014 and dedicated on October 4 of that year. It is the first playing field contiguous to campus and the first in a series of campus developments known as \\"The Burch Initiative\\".https://www.tiltonschool.org/page/news-detail?pk=748225 Academics At Tilton classes are held Monday through Saturday, with half- days on Wednesday and Saturday; the afternoons are reserved for athletics and club activities. Tilton has a student-to-teacher ratio of 5:1 and an average class size of 11 students. 256x256pxTilton maintains an active chapter of the Cum Laude Society. The school also inducts a small group of highly ambitious students into the National Honor Society every year. Academic accolades, character prizes, and book awards are distributed annually at the end of the school year during Prize Night. = Understanding by Design = Tilton School has adopted the principles of the Understanding by Design philosophy which is a framework for designing curriculum, performance assessments, and classroom instruction. Athletics Tilton's athletic program requires students to participate in intramural or interscholastic athletic programs. The New England boarding school offers 16 interscholastic sports with teams at the varsity and junior varsity level as well as intramural sports squads and opportunities for independent study. =Interscholastic sports= Fall * Coed Cross Country * Football * Field Hockey * Coed Mountain Biking * Boys Soccer * Girls Soccer Winter * Boys Basketball * Girls Basketball * Boys Ice Hockey * Girls Ice Hockey * Coed Snowboarding * Wrestling Spring * Baseball * Softball * Boys Lacrosse * Girls Lacrosse * Coed Golf * Boys Tennis * Girls Tennis =Opponents= Tilton School competes in the Lakes Region League, which consists of seven boarding schools in New England that compete athletically and academically. Tilton is also a member of the New England Preparatory School Athletic Council (NEPSAC), as well as the Evergreen League for football. Annual Powder Keg rivalry between Tilton and New Hampton In 2008 Tilton and New Hampton School resumed a long-standing rivalry known as the Powder Keg. The competition between the two schools dates back to 1895 and is among the oldest rivalries in prep school athletics. Tilton has now lost the Powder Keg for eight straight years, with the Rams last win coming in 2011. Other traditional athletic opponents include Phillips Exeter Academy, St. Paul's School, St. Mark's School, Kents Hill School, Cushing Academy, and other prep and boarding schools from across the northeast. =Championships= Since 2010, the girls' varsity basketball team has won four Class B NEPSAC championships, most recently in 2016 and 2017. The girls' varsity basketball team has also won the Lakes Region League Championship every year since 2010. In 2009, the boys' varsity basketball team won the National Prep Championship, and more recently, NEPSAC championships in 2015 and 2018. In 2008 and 2014, the boys' varsity soccer team won NEPSAC championships, and in 2007, the varsity football team went undefeated (9-0) and won a NEPSAC championship. The boys' varsity baseball team won back-to-back Lakes Region championships in 2014 and 2015. Girls' varsity softball most recently won the Lakes Region Championship in 2014. School life Students may participate in intramural sports, including club hockey, basketball, squash, dodgeball, skiing, rock climbing, hiking, and dance. Clubs offered include ceramics, studio art, newspaper (The Tiltonian), photography, community service, outdoor program, yearbook (Tilton Tower), graphic design, Tilton Activity Board (TAB), student government, Parnassus (Tilton School's literary and art magazine), health and wellness, and peer counseling. The Tilton theater group performs three shows a year (fall, winter, and spring) in Hamilton Hall, and typically the winter performance is a musical. =Community service= Over 4,300 hours of community service are completed yearly at Tilton School through its community service program. Tilton students often work closely with the New Hampshire Veterans Home in Tilton, as it is near the campus. Every April, there is an All School Community Service Day in which advisory groups spend their day in the local community helping local residents and businesses complete their spring cleaning. Each year, a group of students travel to the Dominican Republic on their spring break in March to work with the Batey Foundation and help build community centers in impoverished areas. Campus Tilton School sits on on a hill overlooking the village of Tilton. The campus comprises more than 15 buildings, including five residential dormitories, a multi-purpose athletics center, an indoor ice hockey arena, several academic buildings, a school chapel, library, and visual arts center. Skinner Tower, constructed in 2007 and designed by Scott Simons Architects, is located just west of Plimpton Hall and connects to that building. Skinner Tower was named after Carlton Skinner, the first civilian governor of Guam and one of Tilton's most distinguished alumni. It is a , wireless building that is four stories high. The atrium of the tower is used as a common space for students during free periods, as an art gallery, and sometimes as a dance floor for school socials. Skinner Tower is home to the Davis Lecture Hall, a 100-seat, SAT-certified lecture hall which is used as a classroom and venue for speakers and presentations. The first floor comprises a biology laboratory (complete with two-story greenhouse), a chemistry laboratory, and the 9th grade FIRST Program seminar room with a connecting outdoor classroom space. The second floor houses the physics laboratory, math classrooms, and integrated math/science faculty work spaces, which enhance cross-discipline collaboration, as well as the Head of School and Assistant Head of School offices. The third floor has the world languages classrooms and language laboratory and resource rooms, as well as the Center for Academic Achievement, which encompasses 10 one-on-one tutorial rooms, computer lab and common space. Maloney Hall, also constructed in 2007, occupies and houses 20 senior girls, as well as three faculty apartments. There is a recreation room and two-story common room with a fireplace and a kitchenette, as well as laundry and storage facilities. Double rooms all share a bathroom, and proctors' rooms have a private bathroom, the top-floor private bathroom with a skylight as well. The new dormitory marks a shift in housing toward smaller, family-style living. Knowles Hall is the oldest building and the center of Tilton's campus for over 120 years. It houses over half of the student body. The East side of Knowles houses junior boys, the West side of Knowles houses freshman and sophomore girls, and the entire 1st floor of Knowles houses sophomore boys. Knowles Lobby is a popular hangout spot for students and is also occasionally the venue of student socials. Beaumont Hall has two functions. The upper floors of Beaumont Dormitory are the main residential rooms for 9th-grade boys. The ground floor houses the school's main dining room. Beaumont is attached to Knowles Hall. It was built in 1909, when the current dining room replaced a smaller, wooden structure. Tilton Hall was originally built by Charles E. Tilton in 1861. Tilton School purchased the building 101 years later. Tilton Hall, or \\"the Mansion\\", currently houses the Lucian Hunt Library. In 1980, the attached carriage house was renovated to house the Helene Grant Daly Art Center. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. George L. Plimpton Hall, built in 1926, houses the majority of Tilton's classrooms, the Admission Office, and the administrative offices, including Tilton's College Counseling Center. Plimpton Hall is also home to Tilton's Innovation Lab, which includes a 3D printer. 253x253px Pfeiffer Hall, constructed in 1938 and 1939, presently serves as a dormitory for 12th-grade boys. Moore Hall, constructed in 1988, serves as a dormitory for 11th grade and post-graduate girls. Hamilton Hall is home to Tilton's theater and music departments, and was originally the school's gymnasium and recreation center before the Memorial Athletic and Recreational Center was built. The Fred Andrew Smart Chapel was transported in 1965 to Tilton's campus from its original home in Canterbury, New Hampshire. The building serves as a school meeting place and is often a gallery for student art. Burch Field, completed in October 2014, serves as a multi-purpose sports facility. This artificial turf field is used by Field Hockey, Women's Soccer, Football, Women's and Men's Lacrosse, and occasionally Men's Soccer. The facility includes bleachers, a press box, and lighting for contests that take place at night. Construction began when alumnus J. Christopher Burch ('72) made the largest single donation in the school's history in the spring of 2013. The Memorial Gymnasium was built shortly after World War II to honor Tilton students who had served and died for their country. In 1998, the building was completely renovated and rededicated as the Memorial Athletic and Recreational Center (MARC). In the building is a memorial honoring Tilton students who have died in battle, dating back to the Civil War era. The memorial also displays Stephen Holden Doane's ('66) Medal of Honor, which was given to the school by his family. The building contains two basketball courts, a climbing wall, a weight room, six locker rooms, a training room, and a student center including a snack bar called Rusty's Den. A 2008 addition has extended the social area of the MARC, adding more couches, a larger television set, a pool table, and a foosball table. The previous wrestling room moved to the second story of the MARC. The John F. MacMorran Field House, originally built in 1978, provided Tilton with its first indoor hockey arena. In 1999, Tilton completed a $2 million renovation of the facility. Notable alumni *Alfred Aboya, Cameroonian basketball player, UCLA *Michael D.

It includes the hamlets of Le Fayet, La Gache, and the 15th century fort, Fort Barraux. Location Barraux has the village of Chapareillan to the north; La Buissiere, Le Boissieu and La Flachere to the south; Pontcharra to the east and Sainte-Marie-du-Mont, on the Plateau des Petites Roches to the west. It is situated in the valley of the Gresivaudan through which the Is√®re river flows. Population The inhabitants of Barraux are called Barrolins. History (the village) The village of Barraux was probably founded as part of the supply chain to feed the fort Barraux built by Charles Emmanuel II to act as a border fort. In 1985 the fort was given back to the village of Barraux, from the French army. History (the fort) =Fort Saint Barth√©l√©my= Fort Saint Barth√©l√©my (eventually Fort Barraux) is the oldest fort using bastions in France. It was built in 1597 and its aspect changed very little over the past 400 years as the general layout invented by the Piedmontese architect Ercole Negro will be left almost intact by its followers: A fortress with an extended star shape with a narrow end, including many bastions and advanced ditches. The fort was taken by surprise right after its completion by Lesdigui√®res, the Constable of Dauphin√©. A few enhancements have been undertaken by the engineers of King Henry IV but didn't affect the general layout. Vauban himself, Fortress Inspector in Chief of King Louis XIV in the late 17th century didn't change the arrangement of bastions and curtains. He would rather improve the various buildings inside the fort: two barracks, the well, the chapel, the large powder magazine and the gate house. In the early 19th century, a casemate was added southward as this section was considered to be the weakest point =17th century= Original held at Biblioth√®que Municipale of Grenoble. Talented engineers will improve the fort, but keep the general layout designed by Ercole Negro *Jean de Beins enlarges the fort eastward and builds the Governor Hotel. *Camus builds forward bastions southward *Delangrunne levels the West curtain and extracts the central bastion to form the entrance ravelin (or demi-lune). *Entrance of the fort is moved several times during that century. Initially located on the North front (with an access through the Savoie ravelin), it ends up facing West, where it is still today. =Vauban and the Fort= Drawing by Vauban (1692).Original at Historical Services of the French Army (Vincennes) When Vauban arrived at the fort in 1692 he is extremely negative about what was achieved by its predecessors. He asks for the improvement of the most obvious weaknesses: *Ditches are made 2-meter deeper (6 feet) *Design of bastions is modified with their edges sharpened *Width of covered ways is reduced, their layout is streamlined and profile remodeled. Traverses are cut into them to confine the effect of ricochet fire *Galleries are added inside the flanks of bastions *Watchtowers are remodeled *Communication between the central fort and the ravelin of Savoie is modified with the addition of an open caponniere including parapets and palisades *Curtains of the North and East fronts are enhanced with the addition of light tenailles and palisades *Vauban finally creates the South redoubt =18th to 20th centuries= *The gate house and the magazine were completed in the early 18th century. Two additional barracks were built. *The modern chapel was built in 1724 thanks to a gift from King Louis the Fifteenth on the ruins of the initial chapel from the Renaissance. *Large scale construction resumes circa 1820 with the addition of a casemate on the south front to reinforce its defense. *A cylindrical obstacle called \\"demoiselle\\" (Miss), was erected on the top of a traverse that crosses the ditch. Besiegers that would cross this traverse would have to kiss the Miss to bypass it, hence the name. *In the 1870s, unrest with Italy lead to the construction of 6 forts around Grenoble. During the 19th century, defenses of Fort Barraux were also enhanced. *The fort was used as a prison during both world wars; then in 1947, it was turned into an ammunition depot. The fort was left by the military in 1985 and was acquired by the municipality of Barraux.

With the aid of two Maya informants familiar with the script, de Landa made an attempt to provide a transcribed \\"A, B, C\\" for the Maya script with the intent of providing a key to its decipherment and translation. Despite its inaccuracies, the information provided by him would much later prove to be crucial to the mid-20th century breakthrough in the decipherment of the Maya script, starting with the work of the Soviet epigrapher and Mayanist Yuri Knorozov. The \\"alphabet\\", along with some passages of explanatory notes and examples of its use in Maya writing, was written as a small part of de Landa's Relaci√≥n de las cosas de Yucat√°n (\\"Account of the matters of Yucat√°n\\"), which also documented many aspects of the culture and practices of the indigenous Maya peoples that he had seen and been told of when he was living among them in the Yucat√°n Peninsula. His work was written after he had been recalled to Spain to face trial by Inquisition for allegations of improper behaviour while there, and he wrote it as a defense of his mission there. The work was soon thereafter almost forgotten. Lost to scholarship for several centuries, an abridged copy of it was later rediscovered by the French antiquarian scholar Brasseur de Bourbourg in the 19th century. Then a number of unsuccessful attempts were made to use its de Landa alphabet passages to decipher the unknown script because the De Landa script was an alphabet, but the extant Maya texts are logosyllabic. It has been theorized that De Landa might have unwittingly created a spurious writing system by a fundamental lack of understanding of how logosyllabic writing systems function as well as by tenuous access to reliable sources. The pre- existing establishments, such as the Mayan religious order, were all destroyed by invading Spanish belligerents, such as De Landa, to make way for Christian ‚Äúenlightenment‚Äù. In furtherance of this goal, nearly all the Mayan texts were destroyed, in deference to writings that conformed to Biblical doctrine. It was not until the early 1950s when Knorozov published his landmark paper, analyzing it and other inscriptions in a new light, that substantial progress began to be made.

She first appeared on April 1, 2003. In January 2012 it was confirmed that Down was not given a contract renewal, and would exit the show. Storylines Jackie came to town shortly after her son Nick moved to L.A. working for Lauren Fenmore and Fenmore's Department Stores and immediately set her sights on Eric Forrester. This put Jackie at odds with Eric's wife, Stephanie, from the start. When her son became involved with Brooke Logan, who was engaged to Ridge Forrester, Jackie didn't care and pushed Nick to pursue Brooke but this caused Jackie to meet her old lover and Ridge's father Massimo Marone. Jackie began to see Massimo and during a flight that crashed she admitted to Massimo that he was Nick's father and both realized that Frank Payne, her husband at the time, had deceived both of them into thinking that neither cared for the other and Massimo never knew about Nick. Only Jackie knew that Nick was Massimo's son. Jackie and Massimo soon got married and he planned a great future but Jackie continued to support Nick's pursuit of Brooke while Massimo was caught in the middle of the war over Brooke between Ridge and Nick. Brooke married Ridge and the two honeymooned in South America but Ridge and later Brooke and Nick were kidnapped by Sheila Carter. Massimo led a rescue mission but during a fight with Sheila's thugs Ridge was rescuing Brooke but he fell into a burning furnace and was thought to have died. Brooke was overcome with grief and Nick followed her and seduced her but Ridge survived and he returned to L.A. Brooke discovered she was pregnant. Unsure of who the father was, Brooke told Ridge about her night with Nick and took a paternity test that said Nick was the father. Jackie was overjoyed and even before Brooke left Ridge was planning his life with Brooke and the baby but the doctor soon told Jackie that there was a mistake with the test. Jackie kept this hidden from everyone but secretly ran a second test that revealed that Ridge was the father but Jackie still refused to tell anyone who the true father of the baby was for fear of Nick's relationship with Brooke ending. Eventually the truth came out as did Jackie's prior knowledge of the baby's paternity, which greatly strained her relationship with Nick and nearly destroyed her marriage to Massimo who had supported Nick's relationship with Brooke thinking Nick was the father. This caused Ridge to turn his back on Massimo and started a war between Ridge and Nick with Massimo caught in the middle and losing his eldest son Ridge. Around the same time Jackie began an affair with Deacon Sharpe and used him to conduct the second paternity test. The affair was soon discovered by Massimo who had a massive stroke as a result but with the help of his sons recovered. Massimo embarked on a revenge plan against Deacon eventually driving Deacon back into alcoholism and rehab. Massimo divorced Jackie giving her a huge settlement including Jackie M Designs but after Brooke married Nick and Jackie continued to support the marriage, Massimo used his connections with the FBI in Washington D.C. to have Jackie arrested on false charges of tax evasion, money laundering, and tax fraud. Nick later convinced Massimo to release her but also was able to convince the Marone board to replace Massimo as CEO with Nick. Massimo soon left town while Jackie became involved again with Eric but he left her to marry Stephanie as their daughter Felicia's dying wish with the understanding that after Felicia died Eric would marry Jackie. However, Felicia miraculously survived and Eric chose to stay with Stephanie. This didn't mean that she and Stephanie got along. The two women have squabbled numerous times, and recently, one of their arguments have landed Jackie in the hospital, in a coma. (Jackie had fallen off the balcony in the Forrester house). This enraged her son, Nick, and with the help of Donna Logan, he wanted to make Stephanie pay for what she did to his mother. However, events have come forward that Jackie lied about how her accident happened; and also some shameful secrets from her past have come to light. It was discovered that she slept with several sea captains that worked for Marone Industries who came into Seattle for money when Nick was very young; Nick found that untenable, and as such disowned Jackie due to her having been a prostitute. With the help of the psychiatrist Taylor Hayes, Nick has since forgiven Jackie and they once again had a strong relationship. In an attempt to \\"shame\\" Nick and Jackie into returning the Forrester's company to them, Stephanie announced to all that Jackie was a former prostitute during the debut fashion show of \\"The New Nick- owned Forrester Creations.\\" The plan backfired and Jackie garnered sympathy for having had to stoop so low to make a life for her and her son, particularly from Eric. Furious with Stephanie for sinking so low as to reveal such personal and damaging information about Jackie to the world, Eric continued to harbor resentment toward Stephanie and sympathy for Jackie. Jacqueline has taken advantage of Eric's vulnerability toward her and continuously (although unsuccessfully) attempts to seduce him away from Stephanie. It took Stephanie's sister, Pamela, to deflect one of Jackie's attempts to seduce Eric. Jackie made a mistake of underestimating Pamela, and was thrown out. Despite the growing animosity between Nick and the Forresters, Jackie and Eric are still friendly with one another. But as of 2009, Stephanie and Jackie have become best friends. Stephanie became a partner with Jackie at Jackie M Designs helping get the company out of debt, and even becoming the number one fashion house in town beating Forrester Creations. After Stephanie left Jackie M Designs, she and Jackie remained closed. After an unsuccessful attempt at restarting the Brooke's Bedroom, Nick decided to sell Forrester Creations back to Eric, with one ultimatum‚ÄîStephanie may not be a part of the company. The sale was successful, and excluded the sale of Jackie M Boutiques, by which Jackie still owned. Clarke Garrison and her have recently begun a new venture by hoping to revitalize the Spectra Fashions label after Sally Spectra decided that she wanted to sell the company. Jackie hopes that she will be able to compete with the Forrester's better than ever, although she and Eric are still friends, as was evidenced when Eric invited her and Nick to the first fashion show since Eric got Forrester Creations back. Although Stephanie had them removed by security, (Eric found out and was furious with Stephanie for doing that) they still came back. Recently, Jackie became a first time grandmother, when Nick and Taylor finally gave birth to their newborn son, Jack (named after her and Taylor's father). On a less happy note, she was one of the prime suspects in the shooting of Stephanie. When she returned to Jackie M Designs (the former Spectra Fashions), she packed a bag hurriedly, and left town without any explanation. Jackie was a suspect for a while for Stephanie Forrester's shooting but eventually the shooter was revealed to be Storm Logan. What she took from Forrester Creations while she was there has yet to be revealed. Jackie hasn't been around much lately, she was gleefully present at her son's wedding to Bridget Forrester and most recently was seen visiting Eric Forrester in the hospital after he lapsed into a coma. She was a possible suspect in his poisoning but she was once again cleared when Pamela Douglas was revealed to be guilty of the crime. While standing in Eric's hospital room though she did say that if he had married her when he had the chance he wouldn't be in the position he's in now. Most recently Jacqueline's public appearances have included Jack's first birthday party, Ridge and Brooke's rehearsal dinner, Phoebe Forrester's memorial service and Forrester Creations Swim Line Fashion Show. Jackie's company was in danger of going bankrupt so she merged Jackie M Boutiques and M Fashions into one company called Jackie M Designs. She and Nick received all the designs from Forrester Creations newest line via e-mail by a person shrouded in mystery. The mysterious contact asked in return to be made President of the company. That someone was Rick Forrester. The situation appalled Forrester Creations; but Eric, in a show of fair play, allowed Jackie M. Designs to keep the line, since it was already out on the streets, in exchange for Rick not becoming president. Later on, though, his sister, Bridget, taking a leave of absence from the hospital, e-mailed her designs to Jackie, and she was so impressed that she hired her, however incognito as Madame X. Later on, it was apparent that Bridget was working there, because Jackie clearly thinks that she and Nick should be together again, and thus has begun a rivalry with Nick's fiancee, Katie Logan, which is not unlike the rivalry her sisters had with Stephanie. In an ironic twist, Jackie and Nick hired their long-time nemesis, Stephanie Forrester at Jackie M. Designs, after she had been fired from Forrester Creations by her ex, Eric. Due to Stephanie's contacts within the fashion industry, Jackie M. Designs is poised to get itself back to fiscal health. This has also allowed Stephanie to bond closer with Jackie, and the two put aside their combative pasts and to become friends as well as develop a good professional relationship as well. Having recently hired Owen Knight, Jackie has started to date her Chief of Staff. Nick is appalled at the relationship, believing that Owen is simply after Jackie's money. In June 2009, after Jackie fired Owen, for Nick, Owen proposed and Jackie accepted. Nick is furious and vowed never to let his mother marry Owen. When Nick went on his honeymoon with Bridget in Hawaii, Owen bought two plane tickets to Hawaii himself, unaware that Nick and Bridget were also there. The two couples had many near misses but Owen and Bridget eventually saw each other on the beach. They teamed up to make sure Nick and Jackie didn't know the other was in Hawaii. Owen planned a wedding for Jackie unbeknownst to Bridget. When Bridget realized that Owen was planning on marrying Jackie, she told Nick, who rushed out in order to prevent the wedding from going through. However, Nick arrived too late, and was left to see the happy couple driving off. Is it true love or has Jackie made the biggest mistake of her life? On a television talk show, however, Nick, Bridget, Whip and Jackie heard that Owen had declared that she was nothing but his \\"cougar fantasy woman\\" and then snidely told her on TV, that she'd been Punk'd. This sent Jackie to the bottle and into Whip's apartment. It was quickly revealed that the \\"Owen\\" on television was actually Owen's immature twin brother Casper Knight, who was determined to play a prank on Owen. Jackie immediately forgave Owen, but the same couldn't be said for Owen after she confessed to kissing Whip. It took Owen a while to accept what happened, but he eventually forgave his wife. The two remain very much in love, despite the occasional rough spots. However their marriage is in real trouble now because of Owen cheating on Jackie by having a one-night stand with Bridget, which resulted in the birth of his & Bridget's son Logan on September 3, 2010. In October 2010, Rick Forrester, Bridget's older brother, makes his interest in Jackie known to her & begins pursuing her especially after Nick fired Jackie, Owen & Bridget from Jackie M Designs. Even though Jackie is interested, she makes it clear to Rick that she is married to Owen. Rick had no intention of giving up on her no matter what but realizes that it just wasn't worth it in the end. Jackie asked Owen to meet up with Bridget in Hawaii, where she enables Owen to realize his love for his son Logan and Bridget. Jackie sorrowfully asked Owen for a divorce, and Owen went to Bridget. In October 2011, Jackie moves closer again to Eric. They share more kisses but in the end Eric chooses Stephanie and this has angered Jackie. In November 2011, Nick receives an anonymous message from a woman which says to meet him in the sauna of Jackie M When he discovers that it is Stephanie's sister, Pamela Douglas, he is shocked. Pam informs him of her break-up with Stephen and confesses to finding him (Nick) increasingly attractive. Nick rejects her advances, but Jackie makes a deal with Pam: in exchange for her getting to spend time with Nick, Pam agrees to steal some of the sketches from Eric. Pam, who is very hopeful of getting the attention of Nick, goes to work at Forrester Creations, as a receptionist. Pam then took the opportunity to grab each design and handed them over to Nick and Jackie. Thanks to Pam, Jackie M was back in business. After the Jackie M collection is shown, the Forresters soon discover that Nick and Jackie stole their designs, and later discovered that Pam was behind it. In February 2012, Bridget and Owen announce their decision to split in order to allow Owen to return to his marriage with Jackie. Owen and Jackie reunite and declare their love for each other. Jackie moved to New York with Bridget and Logan to be with Owen's family. In 2016, Bridget visited Brooke, Eric, Rick and Maya in LA.

He was a renowned Talmudist and Torah scholar. Early life Shmuel Salant was born in Bia≈Çystok, then part of the Russian Empire, to Tzvi and Raisa (their surname is unknown). After marrying Toiva (Yonah), the eldest daughter of Rabbi Yosef Zundel of Salant, he adopted his father-in-law's surname.Rabbi Meir Baal Haneis At an early age his lungs became damaged, and he was advised to seek a warm climate. This induced him in 1840 to go with his wife and son Binyomin Beinish to Jerusalem. Jewish communal activism En route, in Constantinople, he met and gained the friendship of Sir Moses Montefiore, then on his way to defend the Jews falsely accused in the Damascus Blood Libel. Salant arrived in Jerusalem in 1841, rejoining his father-in-law and about 500 other Ashkenazim who had preceded him. From 1848 to 1851 he served as a meshulach (fund-raiser), visiting the principal cities of Lithuania and Poland to collect money for the impoverished Jews of the Old Yishuv. This age-old practice was termed the Chaluka. In 1860, Salant travelled to Germany, Amsterdam, and London to collect funds. Upon his return to Jerusalem, he succeeded in ensuring that his contributions were equally divided between the Sephardim and Ashkenazim. He also collected donations for the building of the Beis Yaakov Synagogue in Jerusalem. Also in 1860, a time of universal poverty and hardship, Rabbi Salant founded the Rabbi Meir Baal Haneis Salant charity together with his father-in-law, Rabbi Yosef Zundel Salant. Its purpose was to provide for all of Israel's poor and impoverished, Sefardi and Ashkenazi alike. Rabbinic career In 1871, Salant succeeded Rabbi Meir Auerbach as chief rabbi of the Ashkenazim. Rabbis Salant and Auerbach highly supported that the Balady citron cultivated in the Arab village of Umm el-Fahm, was the most kosher to be used as etrog in the four species during the festival of Sukkot.Kuntres Pri Etz Hadar (Jerusalem ◊™◊®◊ú\\"◊ó) Salant was regarded as a distinguished Talmudist and an excellent and learned leader. Many of the halachic (legal) positions are known through the prodigious writing of his student and grandson by marriage, Rabbi Yechiel Michel Tucazinsky. Salant was also known for his moderation and tolerance of all classes of Jews. As Ashkenazic chief rabbi, he was on friendly terms with his Sephardic counterpart, Chief Rabbi Yaakov Shaul Elyashar, and they generally acted in harmony concerning the welfare matters of the community. Salant was instrumental in the establishment of the Etz Chaim Yeshiva in Jerusalem. He also helped found Bikur Cholim Hospital and encouraged people to move into new neighborhoods outside the Old City walls. During his tenure as chief rabbi, the Jewish population of Jerusalem grew from 5,000 to 30,000. In 1888, Salant's eyesight began to fail, and a few years later he became blind. In 1900, he requested an assistant. Rabbi Eliyahu David Rabinowitz-Teomim, known as the Aderet, a renowned rabbi and author, had just arrived in Israel from Russia. He was immediately selected for the position, but predeceased Salant in 1905. Rabbi Salant, as photographed for Pearson's Magazine in July 1909 Salant died in Jerusalem on Monday, 16 August 1909 (29 Av 5669) aged 93Learn Torah, Love Torah, Live Torah: HaRav Mordechai Pinchas Teitz, the Quintessential Rabbi, Rivkah Teitz Blau and was buried on the Mount of Olives. Rabbi Tucazinsky writes that though funerals in Jerusalem are generally performed within the same day or night as the passing, Salant's was an exception. He died at night and the funeral was not held until daybreak because the Rabbis were concerned that the massive attendance to a nighttime funeral procession would lead to injuries or worse. His gravestone was made from a pillar that had stood in the Hurva courtyard where he lived in the Old City.100 Years Since Death of Modern Jerusalem's 1st Chief Rabbi Legacy  In 2006, Salant was memorialized on an Israeli postage stamp. Salant's memory was invoked during the 2011 political lobbying of his direct relative, New York State Senator Stephen Saland, by local chareidi Agudah leadership in opposition to legalization of same sex marriage and the Marriage Equality Act. A descendant is Knesset member Yoav Kish.

WLON also carries Charlotte Hornet Basketball, Carolina Panther Football, the ACC and NCAA basketball tournaments. History Frank Hall of Lake Wylie, Tommy Hunter of Belmont and Jeff and Vivian Nichols of Lincolnton owned the 34-year- old WLON, the only radio station in Lincoln County. Jeff Nichols was general manager. The format was adult contemporary/oldies. Larry Seagle had been news director for 18 years. Tim Biggerstaff had been a DJ for about 10 years. On April 1, 1993, Cherryville-based KTC Broadcasting Inc. took over WLON in a lease agreement. KTC was buying the station but would operate it under a lease agreement until the Federal Communications Commission approved the sale. WLON would join The Piedmont Superstations Radio Network of WCSL in Cherryville, WGNC in Gastonia and WOHS (730 AM) in Shelby, which simulcast most of their programming. The change would mean 24-hour broadcasts on WLON for the first time. .Tim Biggerstaff would remain as morning DJ, and his show would be heard on all four KTC stations. News for the entire area would be expanded. The four stations aired UNC football and basketball, Atlanta Braves baseball, Dallas Cowboys and Washington Redskins NFL football, and CBS coverage of such events as The World Series and The Super Bowl. The four stations added the NFL Carolina Panthers when the team began playing in 1995. They also aired games of the NBA Charlotte Hornets.David Poole, \\"Sports Finds Many Homes on Dial\\", The Charlotte Observer, October 4, 1995 Previous logoLate in 1999, the four stations changed from country music to \\"super oldies.\\" Biggerstaff, the program director, said country had moved away from its traditional sound.

The bishopric of Macon was established as a suffragan of Lyon. The existence of M√¢con as a separate diocese ended at the French Revolution. History The city of M√¢con, formerly the capital of the M√¢connais, now of the Department of Sa√¥ne-et-Loire, became a civitas (Celtic tribal 'city state') in the 5th century, when it was separated from the √Üduan territory. Christianity appears to have been introduced from Lugdunum (present Lyon) into this city at an early period, and Hugh, Archbishop of Lyon, in the eleventh century, would call M√¢con \\"the eldest daughter of the Church of Lyon\\".Goyau, Georges. \\"Ancient Diocese of M√¢con.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 5 November 2017 The bishopric, however, came into existence somewhat later than might have been expected: in the latter part of the 5th century it was still a Bishop of Lyon who brought relief to the famine-stricken people of M√¢con. At the end of that same century Merovingian king Clovis's occupation of the city both foreshadowed the gradual establishment of Frankish supremacy, accompanied by a decline in Arianism in the see. Duchesne thinks that the bishopric of M√¢con, suffragan of Lyon, may have originated in an understanding between the Merovingian princes after the suppression of the Burgundian kingdom. The first bishop historically known is Placidus (538‚Äì555). The authentic list of his successors, as reconstructed by Duchesne, comprises several bishops venerated as saints: St. Florentinus (c. 561); St. C√¶lodonius, who assisted at the Council of Lyon in 570; St. Eusebius, who assisted at two councils, in 581 and 585. Tradition adds to this list the names of St. Salvinius, St. Nicetius (St. Nizier), and St. Justus, as bishops of M√¢con in the course of the sixth century. Among other bishops of later date may be mentioned St. Gerard (886‚Äì926), who died in a hermitage at Brou near Bourg-en-Bresse, and Cardinal Philibert Hugonet (1473‚Äì1484). For many centuries the bishops seem to have been the only rulers of M√¢con; the city had no counts until after 850. From 926 the countship became hereditary. The M√¢connais was sold to king St. Louis in 1239 by Alice of Vienne, daughter of the last count, and her husband, Jean de Braine. In 1435 Charles VII of France, by the Treaty of Arras, ceded it to Philip, Duke of Burgundy, but in 1477 it reverted to France, upon the death of duke Charles the Bold. Emperor Charles V definitively recognized the M√¢connais as French at the Treaty of Cambrai in 1529. The wars of religion filled M√¢con with blood; it was captured on 5 May 1562, by the Protestant Charles Balzac d'Entragues, on 18 August 1562, by the Catholic Tavannes, on 29 September 1567, it again fell into the hands of the Protestants, and on 4 December 1567, was recovered by the Catholics. But the Protestants of M√¢con were saved from the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, probably by the passive resistance with which the bailiff, Philibert de Laguiche, met the orders of king Charles IX of France. Odet de Coligny, known as Cardinal de Ch√¢tillon, who eventually became a Protestant and went to London to marry under the name of Comte de Beauvais, was from 1554 to 1560 prior, and after 1560 provost, of St-Pierre de M√¢con. The Benedictine Abbey of Cluny, situated within the territory of this diocese, was exempted from its jurisdiction in the eleventh century, in spite of the opposition of Bishop Drogo. There is stilt preserved in the archives of the city a copy of the cartulary of the cathedral church of St-Vincent, rebuilt in the 13th century, but destroyed in 1793. The existence of M√¢con as a separate diocese ended at the French Revolution, and the title of M√¢con is since borne by the Bishop of Autun. Councils of M√¢con Of the six councils held at M√¢con (579, 581‚Äìor 582‚Äì585, 624, 906, 1286), the second and third, convoked by command of King Gontran, are worthy of special mention. The second council, in 581 or 582, which assembled six metropolitans and fifteen bishops, enacted penalties against luxury among the clergy, against clerics who summoned other clerics before lay tribunals, and against religious who married; it also regulated the relations of Christians with Jews. The third council, in 585, at which 43 bishops and the representatives of 20 other bishops assisted, tried the bishops accused of having taken part in the revolt of Gondebaud, fixed the penalties for violating the Sunday rest, insisted on the obligation of paying tithes, established the right of the bishop to interfere in the courts when widows and orphans were concerned, determined the relative precedence of clerics and laymen, and decreed that every three years a national synod should be convoked by the Bishop of Lyon and the king.

Before the advent of Bollywood (the Hindi film industry), Nautanki was the biggest entertainment medium in the villages and towns of northern India. Nautanki's rich musical compositions and humorous, entertaining storylines hold a strong influence over rural people's imagination. Even after the spread of mass media (such as television and DVDs), a crowd of 10,000 to 15,000 can be seen at the top Nautanki performances. Nautanki's origins lie in the Saangit, Bhagat, and Swang musical theatre traditions of Northern India. One Saangit called Saangit Rani Nautanki Ka became so popular that the whole genre's name became Nautanki. Performances Nautanki performances are operas based on a popular folk theme derived from romantic tales, mythologies, or biographies of local heroes. The performance is often punctuated with individual songs, dances, and skits, which serve as breaks and comic relief for audiences. Audiences sometimes use the breaks to go to the toilet or pick up food from their homes or nearby shops. Nautanki performances involve a lot of community participation from audiences. For instance, community members provide logistical support, financial support, and talented actors for Nautanki performances. Audience members choose what script will be performed and often intervene during the performance to demand a repeat of a song or skit. Legendary Nautanki artist and Sangeet Natak Akademi awardee Pandit Ram Dayal Sharma as Amar Singh Rathore and Dr. Devendra Sharma as Ram Singh in Amar Singh Rathore Nautanki performances can take place in any open space available in or around a village that can accommodate audiences in hundreds or thousands. Sometimes this space is made available by the village Chaupal (village community center). Other times, the playground of the local school becomes the performance site. A Nautanki stage is elevated above the ground and is made up of wooden cots (usually provided by local villagers). Until a few decades back, there was no electricity in Indian villages, so light was provided either by big lanterns or Petromax (a device run by kerosene oil). The pleasure of Nautanki lies in the intense mellifluous exchanges between two or three performers; a chorus is used sometimes. Traditional Nautanki performances usually start late at night, often around 10 p.m. or so, and go all night until sunrise the next morning (for a total of 8‚Äì10 hours). There is no intermission in Nautanki performances. Story lines Story lines of traditional Nautankis range from mythological and folk tales to stories of contemporary heroes. For instance, while Nautanki plays such as Satya- Harishchandra and Bhakt Moradhwaj are based on mythological themes, Indal Haran and Puranmal originated from folklore. In the first half of the 20th century, contemporary sentiment against British rule and feudal landlords found expression in Nautankis such as Sultana Daku, Jalianwala Bagh, and Amar Singh Rathore. In the last four decades, Pandit Ram Dayal Sharma (a renowned Nautanki maestro) and later Dr. Devendra Sharma have co-authored many new Nautankis. These new Nautankis are centered on contemporary social messages such as health, HIV/AIDS, women's empowerment, dowry, immigration, and family planning. They are of a much shorter duration ‚Äî around two hours. This is to give audiences an opportunity to watch performances during a break in their daily routine. These contemporary Nautankis have been performed extensively in India and America and met with resounding popularity. Some popular traditional Nautankis are Syah-Posh (Pak Mohabbat), Sultana Daku, Indal Haran, Amar Singh Rathore, Bhakt Puranmal, and Harischandra-Taramati. Some popular contemporary ones are Mission Suhani, Subah ka Bhoola, Behkaani and Muskaani, and Beti ka Byah (all of these contemporary Nautankis are written by Pandit Ram Dayal Sharma). Performers Some famous performers are Gokul Korea, Ghasso, Ram Swarup Sharma of Samai-Khera, Manohar Lal Sharma and Giriraj Prasad of Kaman District Bharatpur, Pandit Ram Dayal Sharma, Chunni Lal, Puran Lal Sharma, Amarnath, Gulab Bai, and Krishna Kumari.  Overseas  In 2002, Nautanki was introduced in America by Dr. Devendra Sharma, a Nautanki artist, singer, writer, director, and scholar of communication and performance. The participants in Sharma's productions are engineers, doctors, and other members of the Indian diaspora living in America, who are given a rare opportunity to connect with their cultural roots. At the same time, these performances have exposed other communities in America to Indian culture. One such Nautanki is Mission Suhani, an original Nautanki co-authored by Sharma and Pandit Ram Dayal Sharma that communicates a contemporary and controversial social issue concerning Indians and Indian immigrants in America. It critically examines the phenomenon of some Indian men who come to America to study or work, but go back to India and get married ‚Äî either because of parental pressure or to get a big dowry (cash given to the groom's family by the bride's side). Many of these men leave their wives in India and never bring them to America, where they often have another wife or a girlfriend. One of the unique aspects of this Nautanki is that it is bilingual (Hindi and English). This protects the traditional operatic and artistic elements of Nautanki while effectively communicating the story and contemporary social issue to a diverse audience. Nautankis such as Mission Suhani involving global social issues help to update Nautanki to emerging issues in India and around the world.  References  # # Ramnarayan Agrawal (1976).

It previously operated as the Electric Tokamak (ET) between 1999 and 2006 and was noted for being the world's largest tokamak before being decommissioned due to the lack of support and funding. The machine was renamed to ETPD in 2009. At present, the machine is undergoing upgrades to be re- purposed into a general laboratory for experimental plasma physics research. As the Electric Tokamak The Electric Tokamak (ET) was the last of a series of small tokamak machines built in 1998 under the direction of principal investigator and designer, Robert Taylor, a UCLA professor. The machine was designed to be a low field (0.25 T) magnetic confinement fusion device with a large aspect ratio. It is composed of 16 vacuum chambers made of 1-inch thick steel, with a major radius of 5 meters and a minor radius of 1 meter. The ET was the largest tokamak ever built at its time, with a vacuum vessel slightly bigger than that of the Joint European Torus. The first plasma was achieved in January 1999. The ET is capable of producing a plasma current of 45 kiloamperes and can produce a core electron plasma temperature of 300 eV.Initial Plasmas in the Electric Tokamak. Four sets of independent coils are necessary for OH (ohmic heating) current drive, vertical equilibrium field, plasma elongation and plasma shaping (D or reverse-D). The OH system provides 10 V¬∑s using a 10 kA power supply. Up to 0.1 T of vertical field can be applied for horizontal control and this is more than sufficient for all plasma configurations, including high beta. An additional set of coils provide a small horizontal field to correct for error field and to stabilize the plasma vertically. All the coils are located outside the vessel and are constructed out of aluminium. A Rogowski probe outside the vessel and sets of Hall probes inside the vessel are used to monitor plasma current, position and shaping and are used in the control feedback loop. The poloidal system was designed using an in-house equilibrium code as well as a variety of other codes in order to cross-check computations and to assess the stability of the resulting plasma. Like most tokamaks, the machine uses a combination of RF heating and neutral beam injection to drive and shape the plasma. =Decommission in 2006= In 2006, the ET had run out of funding and was decommissioned following the retirement of Taylor. Factors leading to loss of funding are attributed to the lack of extensive plasma diagnostics, its large size, and its place in the politics of fusion. When it was operating, the ET was funded mostly by the Department of Energy (DOE).  As the Enormous Toroidal Plasma Device  In 2009, the Electric Tokamak (ET) was renamed to the Enormous Toroidal Plasma Device (ETPD) and was re-purposed for basic plasma research. A lanthanium hexaboride (LaB6) plasma source was developed for the ETPD (similar to the one used in the Large Plasma Device), and is capable of producing a long column of magnetized plasma (~100 m) that winds itself multiple times along the toroidal axis of the machine. The plasma column was shown to be current-free and terminates on the neutral gas within the chamber without touching the machine walls. The typical operational parameters of the ETPD are: * Density: n ‚â§ 3 √ó 1013 cm‚àí3 * Electron Temperature: 5 eV < Te < 30 eV *Ion Temperature 1 eV < Ti < 16 eV * Background field: B = 250 gauss (25 mT) *Plasma beta: Œ≤ ~ 1 The ETPD is currently in the process of being upgraded (i.e. larger sources, better diagnostic capabilities) to support a wide range of plasma physics experiments.

Tramways are lightly laid railways, sometimes with the wagons or carriages moved without locomotives. Because individual tramway vehicles are not intended to carry the weight of typical standard-gauge railway equipment, the tramways over which they operate may be built from less substantial materials. Tramways can take many forms; sometimes just tracks temporarily placed on the ground to transport materials around a factory, mine or quarry. Many, if not most, use narrow-gauge railway technology. The trains can be manually pushed by hand, pulled by animals (especially horses and mules), cable hauled by a stationary engine, or use small, light locomotives. At the other extreme they could be complex and lengthy systems, such as the Lee Moor Tramway in the county of Devon, England, in the United Kingdom. The term is not in use in North America but in common use in the United Kingdom, and elsewhere, where British Railway terminology and practices had large influences on management practices, terminology, and railway cultures such as Australia, New Zealand, and those parts of Asia that consulted with British experts when undergoing modernization. In New Zealand, they are commonly known as bush tramways, while in parts of Australia where American experts were influential, the term is less common. They generally do not carry passengers, although staff may use them, either officially or unofficially--and are often not intended to be permanent. History A horse-drawn tram carrying slate at Dyffryn Nantlle in Wales, 1959. The term was originally applied to wagons running on primitive tracks in early England and Europe. The name seems to date from around 1517 and to be derived from an English dialect word for the shaft of a wheelbarrow‚Äîin turn from Low German traam, literally, beam.Merriam- Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (On line accessed 27 Oct 2007) The tracks themselves were sometimes known as gangways,As, for instance Little Eaton Gangway dating from before the 12th century, being usually simply planks laid upon the ground literally \\"going road\\". In south Wales and Somerset the term \\"dramway\\" is also used, with vehicles being called drams. The alternative term is \\"wagonway\\" (and wainway or waggonway) which originally consisted of horses, equipment and tracks which were used for hauling wagons. Usually the wheels would be guided along grooves. In time, to combat wear, the timber would be reinforced with an iron strip covering. This developed to use \\"L\\"-shaped steel plates, the track then being known as a plateway. The origin of the word railway is uncertain, but Benjamin Outram was referring to his lines as railways in the early 19th century. The fact that many of these lines were built for horse-drawn vehicles, and were dimensioned accordingly, is thought to be behind the modern . An alternative appeared, the so-called \\"edge-rail\\" where the wagons were guided by having the wheels flanged instead of running in grooves. Since these rails were raised above the ground they were less likely to be blocked by debris, but they obstructed other traffic. They were, however, the forerunners of the modern railway. These early lines were built to transport minerals from quarries and mines to canal wharves. From about 1830, more extensive trunk railways appeared, becoming faster, heavier and more sophisticated and, for safety reasons, the requirements placed on them by Parliament became more and more stringent. See rail tracks. These restrictions were excessive for the small mineral lines and it became possible in the United Kingdom for them to be categorised as Light railways subject to certain provisos laid down by the Light Railways Act 1896. Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom the term tramway became the term for passenger vehicles (a tram) that ran on tracks in the public highway, sharing with other road users.1901: Standing Orders, House of Lords, Priv. bills 7 \\"In these orders ... 'Tramway' means a tramway laid along a street or road; the term 'tramroad' means a tramway laid elsewhere than along a street or road.\\" From Oxford English Dictionary On-line (Second Ed 1989) Initially horse-drawn, they developed to use electric power from an overhead line. A development of the tramway in the United Kingdom dispensed with tracks, but retained electric power from overhead wires; it was the trolley bus. In 2000 the CarGoTram began operating as a cargo tram for the Volkswagen factory in Dresden.  Notional tramways  In Australia, most \\"tramways\\" (other than urban street trams) were in practice heavy railways, or equivalent to British light railways, but known as tramways for legal reasons.

Ng was known as one of the better three-point shooters in the National Basketball League (NBL). He decided to sit out the 2012‚Äì13 NBL season for family and career reasons, being a new father and a practising physician as a resident doctor at the Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH).NBL break what the doctor orders For the 2013‚Äì14 NBL season, Ng returned to the 36ers, not as a player but as the club doctor. Early life Ng is the oldest child of a practicing Adelaide GP. Both of his younger brothers have also finished medical school making a total of four fully qualified doctors in the Ng family. Born and bred in Adelaide, Ng went to St Peter's College and it was in Year 10 that he decided to pursue a career in medicine. However, he would end up juggling his studies with his career in basketball as he was signed by NBL team the Adelaide 36ers as a development player in 2002. Career In 2001, Ng played at the national under 18 tournament where he was ranked fourth overall in scoring at 21 points per game. Ng started his NBL career with the 36ers in 2002 and played with them through to the end of the 2006‚Äì07 NBL season, although he did sit out the entire 2005-06 NBL season to pursue his medical studies. Ng signed with the Singapore Slingers for the 2007‚Äì08 NBL season and averaged a career high 13.3 points, 4.5 rebounds and 1.8 assists per game. The Slingers folded before the start of the 2008‚Äì09 season, leaving him without a team although he later played for the Slingers in their International Challenge Series. While pursuing his medical studies, Ng played for Sturt and Woodville in the ABA and won the Woollacott Medal award as the leading player in the 2006 ABA Central Conference. On 18 June 2009, it was announced that Ng would make his return to the 36ers. The 2009‚Äì10 NBL season saw Ng average 8.6 points, 2.2 rebounds and 1.9 assists per game. His 2010‚Äì11 season was cut short when he rolled his ankle in a clash with Kirk Penney of the New Zealand Breakers on 8 January. X-rays cleared Ng of any broken bones but further MRI scans revealed significant ligament damage which has put him on the sidelines for an expected 8‚Äì12 weeks.Darren Ng's season on the brink Ng made his comeback at the start of the 2011‚Äì12 season and while seeing limited time on the court has played all 14 of the 36ers games for the season as of 2 January 2012 and is averaging 6 points, 1.6 assists and 0.8 rebounds in 13.9 minutes of game time.Player statistics for Darren Ng He hit a season high 20 points on 8/13 shooting including 4/8 from outside the Three- point line in a losing effort against the Gold Coast Blaze on 26 November as Adelaide went down 82-95 at the Adelaide Arena.Ng on fire as Sixers go down In a poll of NBL players (taken before the start of the 2011‚Äì12 season), Ng was rated the best shooter in the league with 21% of players polled voting for the Doctor ahead of import guards Andrew Warren (Cairns Taipans - 16%) and Kevin Lisch (Perth Wildcats - 14%).Player choice poll results released In August 2012, and shortly after the birth of his son, it was announced that Ng had decided to voluntarily sit out the 2012‚Äì13 NBL season after he told Adelaide 36ers officials he wanted at least 12 months off from NBL duties to spend time with family, concentrate on his medical career and freshen up mentally. \\"I talked to the club (36ers) about coming back ... but I felt it was the right time to give it a break,\\" Ng said. \\"I've just had a baby and am well entrenched in general practice training. I'll reassess it (NBL future) again next year...But it's probably going to be hard to stay away completely from basketball so at this stage I'm planning to continue playing state league (with Sturt in 2013).\\" In 2014, Ng won his second Central ABL championship in the Woodville Warriors' 80-78 win over the West Adelaide Bearcats.Woodville take out Title After spending four seasons with the Woodville Warriors, Ng announced his retirement from playing professional basketball in 2017. Medical career Ng attended the University of Adelaide's Medical school while also pursuing his career as a professional basketball player. After graduating with a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS), Ng has been working as a resident doctor at the Royal Adelaide Hospital's Emergency department. Ironically during the 2011‚Äì12 pre-season, Ng had to be admitted to the hospital with Pneumonia after games with Sturt and training with the 36ers left him feeling flat. On 26 September 2013, the Adelaide 36ers announced that Ng would return to the club in the 2013‚Äì14 NBL season in the role of club doctor.

Preparation The dish consists of cubes of chicken that are marinated, then skewered and grilled. Common marinades are based upon yogurt and lemon juice or tomato puree, though there are other variations. Methods of serving The dish is eaten either as a sandwich or on a platter with vegetables, sometimes with rice or French fries. The Turkish cuisine version is generally served with rice, yogurt, and skewer-grilled vegetables.

History The Serrall√©s family migrated from Catalonia to Puerto Rico in the mid-1830s, and established a sugar cane plantation in the outskirts of Ponce. They were successful in harvesting and refining cane sugar and exporting it to the United States, the United Kingdom and France. The plantation became very prosperous, and virtually became a company town, with its own rail line, workers' housing, transportation fleet, commissary, and private‚Äîlater public‚Äîairport (Ponce's Mercedita Airport). Most of these operations were eventually annexed to the municipality of Ponce, in whose lands the plantation is based.Destileria Serralles History In 1865, the family opened a rum manufacturer at the plantation, \\"Hacienda Mercedita\\". On that year, Juan Serrall√©s, who would go down as one of the most successful liquor salesmen in Puerto Rican history, imported a still from France, which enabled him to produce his first casks of rum. The Serrall√©s operation produced various local rum brands, most of which were short-lived. Inspired by the success of other rum producers in the island, the family decided to launch a refined brand with the intention of exporting it elsewhere. The Don Q brand was launched in 1932, and became popular with locals who considered rival Bacardi either harsher in taste or a foreign brand (when Bacard√≠ opened its distilling operations in Puerto Rico in the early 1930s it was considered a Cuban brand since its headquarters were in Cuba; since the 1960s Cuban revolution, Bacardi has had its headquarters in Bermuda). By the 1960s, Don Q was available on most of Puerto Rico's important supermarket chains, such as Pueblo and others. It also became available at Amigo. Distillation process Don Q is distilled from sugar cane. The combination of the type of yeasts employed for fermentation, distillation method, aging conditions, and blending determines the characteristic flavor of rum. Made with molasses, water, mash, and yeast, Don Q is distilled in a continuous still. Once distilled, the clear spirit is aged in oak barrels for up to a year per Puerto Rican law, adding a golden color and character to the rum. Flavors and spices, if any, are added as an option at this point. The brand‚Äôs taste is achieved through a proprietary recipe, which is blended into the rum mixture at the final stages of production. Advertising and sales Don Q served at Intercontinental Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico Currently, Don Q is sold in the United States, Mexico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Spain, and a number of other countries. Don Q is the best-selling rum in Puerto Rico.Rum - Don Q Gold: Destileria Serrall√©s. Chris Carlsson. Spirits Review. Retrieved 15 March 2015.

In the book K√§stner took up the predominantly British genre of the school story, taking place in a boarding school, and transferred it to an unmistakably German background. Plot summary The story covers the last few days of term before Christmas for the students of the Johann-Sigismund Gymnasium. The main characters are Martin, the first student of the class, Jonathan, an orphan who was adopted by a captain, Matz, Uli and Sebastian, students from the Tertia (Year 8). There is a bitter struggle between the students at the Gymnasium and another school, the Realschule (which is, with some probability, not the Realschule as known today, but an Oberrealschule, as the science -oriented, rather than humanist and focussing on classical philology, variety of the Gymnasium was then called). The so-called \\"Realists\\" steal their schoolbooks containing their dictations, which the teacher's son (another classmate) was to carry home to his father. The son was also captured by the 'Realsch√ºler'. This results in a brawl between two champions of each side - Matz and one Wawerka - and a hard- fought snow-ball fight, both of which the six friends win, although they end up being reported by a student from the Prima (Year 13) for being late back to school. As a \\"punishment\\" they are docked one afternoon's leave, which they are invited to spend with their amiable house teacher Mr Johann (\\"Justus\\") B√∂kh at his office (coffee and cake included) where he tells them a story about his own youth and his struggle with unreasonable prefects from the Prima. Other parts of the plot include: the friends playing a drama called the Flying Classroom written by Johnny, their friendship with the \\"Nonsmoker\\" (a former doctor who lives in an scrapped non-smoker railway compartment and works as a pub piano player) and the Nonsmoker's own friendship with Mr B√∂kh, with whom the boys help to re-unite him. Uli, the smallest boy, decides at this time to attempt something which will remove his reputation as a coward. His best friend, Matz, has in the past encouraged him to try to shed it, but he is horrified when he sees Uli about to jump off a tall climbing frame using an umbrella as a parachute. Uli crashes to the ground and falls unconscious. As the boys know that the Nonsmoker used to be a doctor, they fetch him, and he allays their fears that Uli is dead. However, he has a broken leg (in the Canadian version, Uli breaks an arm instead). Upon this, the Nonsmoker re- enters the medical profession as he becomes the new school doctor. Characters Jonathan Trotz, or Johnny - a half-American boy cast away by his parents. He loves poetry and writing, and dreams of being a great writer one day. He wants to marry a kind-hearted woman and have children - children that he won't cast away. Martin Thaler, or Das Dreimarkst√ºckIn 1873, the mark had replaced the Taler at an exchange rate of 1 Taler = 3 Mark; existing talers were used as three-mark coins, hence the nickname. \\\\- a poor (in terms of family means) but bright student. His parents cannot afford to have him travel home this Christmas and it troubles him very much. Martin has a very strong sense of justice and will come out fighting with his friends although it means risking his scholarship. Matthias Selbmann, or Matz - not very clever, but strong. He wants to be a professional boxer. The other children rely on him to smash their opponents. Matz is somewhat overprotective towards his best friend, Uli. Uli von Simmern - the blond, small, underrated rich boy, best friend of Matz. He always tries to do his best during fighting - but usually ends up hiding in fear. Uli decides to perform an act of bravado to make the others stop poking fun at him. Sebastian Frank - the cynical one of the five. He spends his time reading 'smart books', such as ones dealing with genetics or (Schopenhauerian) philosophy. Although he hangs out a lot with Jonathan and the other guys, he actually has no real friends and is a lonely figure, putting up a cold mask to cover his own weaknesses. Theodor Laban - called Der Sch√∂ne Theodor (Handsome Theo). He is Martin's prefect, busy trying to make himself look good in the eyes of the teachers. Dr Johann B√∂kh, nicknamed Justus - the children's favourite teacher. He was a student of the Johann-Sigismund School and knows well how hard life in the school can be. That's why he returned to the school - to ensure that children don't have to suffer, like he did. Dr. Robert Uthofft, nicknamed Nonsmoker - an old friend of Justus'. He was a medical doctor. When he lost his wife and child, he disappeared, and later took up residence in a trailer situated near his old school. His nickname does not relate to his not smoking (he does, very much so) but to his living in an old railway carriage, which still bears a sign that reads \\"Nonsmoker\\".

Background, the sequel and trivia This was the last K√§stner book published before the rise of the Nazis to power. Though Nazis are not explicitly mentioned anywhere in the book, the situation of economic crisis and mass unemployment which made many German voters turn to Hitler is very evident in the book's background. Shortly after publishing Das fliegende Klassenzimmer he had to witness how the NSDAP turned to power and how his books were burned as well as those from other dissidents. A short sequel, in which the characters visit the Winter Olympics of 1936 (held at Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Bavaria) was already written under the Nazi regime and was published only many years later, having less success than the original: Zwei Sch√ºler sind verschwunden in Das Schwein beim Friseur (The Pig at the Barbershop). In it, K√§stner let his characters have a friendly encounter with visiting English boys, culminating in winning their British Gold Medal, at a time when their soon meeting each other as enemy soldiers on the battlefield was already a very real possibility.

Its native name was simply ‚ÄôƒÅ‚ÄôƒÅ (\\"parrot\\") according to Latham (1790) though White (1887) gives \\"aa-maha\\". Etymology: After Tregear (1891), probably means \\"plentiful parrot\\". For the Samoan parrots used in the feather trade - probably blue-crowned lories (Vini australis) - Tregear (1891) records the Tahitian name \\"aa- taevao\\", \\"parrot imported from abroads\\". It was discovered on James Cook's first voyage in 1769, on which the two specimens now in Liverpool and the one in the Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum in Tring appear to have been collected. Two of them - one of those in Liverpool and the Tring specimen - may also have been taken on Cook's second voyage, in 1773, but the type was painted by Sydney Parkinson who had died in 1771. Another specimen, collected by Amadis in 1842, is in the museum at Perpignan. The last known specimen was collected in 1844 by Lieutenant des Marolles, and is now housed in the Mus√©um national d'Histoire naturelle, Paris. Extinction Painting by Georg Forster Like its relative, the Society parakeet, the species inhabited woodlands, but as testified by the 1773 report of Georg Forster, they were able to persist in numbers despite widespread deforestation for agriculture and the presence of the small kiore rats and pigs, which undoubtedly preyed on the bird's eggs on occasion. The natives of Tahiti, who valued red parrot feathers for use in handicraft above all others, had to trade for these with the Samoans, as the black-fronted parakeet did not possess the desired feathers in sufficient quality and quantity. However, they liked to keep the species as pets. After the introduction of cats and European rats, the species rapidly succumbed to these predators.

Its primary objective was to quell the ongoing Taliban insurgency in the south of the country. Results There was heavy fighting during June and July 2006, with Afghanistan seeing the bloodiest period since the fall of the Taliban regime. The Taliban showed great coordination in their attacks, even capturing two districts of Helmand province at the end of July, which were retaken a few days later. The Taliban suffered during the fighting more than 1,100 killed and close to 400 captured. Heavy aerial bombing was the main factor. But even so the coalition forces had close to 150 soldiers killed and 40 Afghan policemen captured by the Taliban. Tom Koenigs, the top U.N. official in Afghanistan, told the German news weekly Der Spiegel that the Taliban numbers of casualties do not reflect success. \\"The Taliban fighters reservoir is practically limitless,\\" Koenigs told the magazine in an interview. \\"The movement will not be overcome by high casualty figures.\\" In the end, the operation did not manage to quell the Taliban insurgency. Control of the region was transferred from the Americans to NATO forces. Attacks continued and even intensified. On the first day that NATO took control, August 1, a British patrol was hit by enemy fire in Helmand province; three soldiers were killed and one wounded. On the same day 18 Taliban and one policeman were killed in an anti-Taliban coalition operation in the same province and 15 Afghan policemen were captured when they surrendered in Zabul province while a Taliban force was preparing to attack their police post. Also two days later there were several incidents in and around Kandahar, including a suicide bombing which killed 21 civilians. In the other attacks in and around Kandahar, four Canadian soldiers were killed and ten were wounded. These clearly demonstrated that the Taliban forces are still a threat. American forces still remain in the eastern provinces.

French critic P.G. Castex has described The Devil In Love as \\"the very initiator of the modern fantasy story\\".Castex quoted in Franz Rottensteiner, The Fantasy Book:an illustrated history from Dracula to Tolkien. Collier Books, 1978, (p. 137). Canadian critic Carlo Testa has described The Devil In Love (in review of Stephen Sartarelli's 1993 translation) as a \\"terminus a quo\\" in the history of the demonic subgenre\\". The Le Diable amoureux started a literary style known as fantastique, where surreal events intrude on reality and the reader is left guessing whether the events actually occurred or were merely the product of the character's imagination. Plot Don Alvaro, a young but wise man, invokes Satan. Upon seeing the young Alvaro, Satan falls in love with him and assumes the appearance of a young woman, Biondetta. He follows Alvaro as his page. In the journey that unfolds, Satan, disguised as a woman, tries to seduce Alvaro who rejects his advances lest he lose his precious virginity. He is unwilling to compromise his honor by sleeping with a woman before they are married and he will first need his mother‚Äôs approval of the union.

First residence of the Counts of Altena, the title and family name were later changed, by Adolf I, to La Mark Coat of arms of the counts of the Mark Adolf I, Count de la Mark (German: Adolf I. Graf von der Mark und Krickenbeck) (c. 1182? ‚Äì 28 June 1249), until 1226 also known as Adolf I, Count of Altena-Mark. He was son of Frederick I, Count of Berg-Altena and Alveradis of Krickenbeck, daughter of Reiner of Krieckenbeck- Millendonk..Genealogie Mittelalter Adolf belonged to a collateral line of the counts of Berg and was founder of the new noble branch of the Counts de la Mark. Following the year 1226, he reunited the lands of the Counts of Berg- Altena, which had been in possession of the counts of Altena and Isenberg, the senior lines of the family ever since the division of their heritage in 1180, thereby forming the county of Mark with its capital city of Hamm. Moreover, Adolf I was reeve of the monasteries of Cappenberg and Werden. Date of birth Adolf's date of birth is unclear. Commonly accepted is the year 1194,cf. \\"Chronicles of the Counts of the Mark\\" by Levold of Northof, de Northof Levolous, Fritz Zschaeck, published by Weidmann, 1955.Zur Burg Schwarzenberg though sometimes an earlier date has been assumed.Ralf G. Jahn: Die Genealogie, der V√∂gte, Grafen und Herz√∂ge von Geldern. In: Johannes Stinner und Karl-Heinz Tekath (Hrsg.): Gelre ‚Äì Geldern ‚Äì Gelderland. Geschichte und Kultur des Herzogtums Geldern. Geldern 2001, S. 29‚Äì50 (Ver√∂ffentlichungen der Staatlichen Archive des Landes Nordrhein‚ÄìWestfalen, Reihe D, Band 30) In his book Die Landst√§nde der Grafschaft Mark bis zum Jahre 1510: Mit Urkundlichen Beilagen, Rudolf Schulze determined Adolf's date of birth to be in 1164. This assertion does not tie with his parents' life data. Referring to various sources, the year 1199 is proposed by Genealogie Mittelalter. At that time Adolf must have been born already, though; in 1198 his father Frederick had erected Burg Mark on the hill belonging to Oberhof Mark near Hamm on behalf of his son.Stellvertretend f√ºr viele weitere Quellen: Die Homburg und die Burg Mark, Kreisfreie Stadt Hamm. Herausgegeben vom Landschaftsverband Westfalen-Lippe als Schrift Fr√ºhe Burgen in Westfalen 19 im Jahre 1979. In fact Adolf signed as a witness a charter in 1194,Richard Knipping: Die Regesten der Erzbisch√∂fe von K√∂ln. Zweiter Band 1105-1205, Bonn 1901. Nr. 1481. and thus logic requires that he had reached majority by that time. In medieval Germany majority was bound to the ability to serve in battle or bearing arms. This was usually between 12 and 15, so that Adolf had to be born at least 12 years before signing the charter in 1194. Referring to this Adolf was born in the period between 1179 and 1182. Another legal fact supporting this theory is that Adolf's father died either in 1198 or 1199 and he became the new Count of Altena-Mark and Krickenbeck. If he was not old enough to rule by that time his mother or a close relative would have become regent for him. But there is no sign of this in any charters of the time. Instead Adolf is signing further charters; in 1202 he names himself in another charter Adolfus puer comes de Marke. The puer comes was often translated as \\"young Count\\" but in medieval times the Latin word puer is also used for the social status known as knave or squire, or by simpler means as Knight in apprenticeship. In 1205 he signs again a charter but this time only using his legal name and title as Adolphus com. de Marka without the puer prefixed to the title. His time as squire was seemingly over. So any assumed date of birth after 1182 becomes more unlikely. Noble boys started their career at age 12, but more normally at 14 years, the same age they gained their majority. The apprenticeship lasted usually until the age of 20 or 21, before the squire was finally knighted. This fits perfectly with Adolf being puer comes... in 1202 and com. de Marka in 1205, even by means of the age, if he was born in 1182 he would have been 20 by 1202 and about 23 by 1205.  Life  Like his father Adolf I became Count of Berg-Altena and Krickenbeck and reeve of the monasteries of Werden and Cappenberg. From 1202, Adolf took on the sobriquet of \\"von der Mark\\", after this new main residency which his father had built on land originally acquired from either the Archbishop of Cologne (Philipp of Heinsberg) or the noble family of R√ºdenberg. As with the whole family, Adolf was drawn into the German Crown Heritage Dispute. Sources differ for which side he fought. Stirnberg has it that Adolf was on the Staufers side right from the beginning. Possibly Adolf stayed undecided until he finally decided with the Staufer in 1212. However, in 1225 Adolf seemed to have established himself as loyal kinsman of the Emperor and the Archbishop of Cologne. After the conflict opposing his cousins Frederick of Isenberg and Engelbert II of Berg, Archbishop of Cologne, which ended with the murder of the Archbishop and the condemnation and execution of Frederick, Adolf was awarded large portions of his cousin's, Frederick of Isenberg, properties, thereby re-uniting most of the Berg inheritance. Death Adolf died on 28 June 1249; he is buried in Cappenberg Abbey.Dr. Julius Ficker, Engelbert der Heilige, Erzbischof von K√∂ln und Reichsverweser, K√∂ln 1853, S. 253.

This is in contrast to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common form of MND, which affects both the upper and lower motor neurones, or primary lateral sclerosis, another rare MND variant, which affects only the upper motor neurons. The distinction is important because PMA is associated with a better prognosis than classic ALS.

Instead, a number of other possibilities have to be ruled out, such as multifocal motor neuropathy or spinal muscular atrophy. Tests used in the diagnostic process include MRI, clinical examination, and EMG. EMG tests in patients who do have PMA usually show denervation (neurone death) in most affected body parts, and in some unaffected parts too. It typically takes longer to be diagnosed with PMA than ALS, an average of 20 months for PMA vs 15 months in ALS/MND. =Differential diagnosis= In contrast to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or primary lateral sclerosis, PMA is distinguished by the absence of: * brisk reflexes * spasticity * Babinski's sign * emotional lability Prognosis The importance of correctly recognizing progressive muscular atrophy as opposed to ALS is important for several reasons. * 1) the prognosis is a little better. A recent study found the 5-year survival rate in PMA to be 33% (vs 20% in ALS) and the 10-year survival rate to be 12% (vs 6% in ALS). * 2) Patients with PMA do not suffer from the cognitive change identified in certain groups of patients with MND. * 3) Because PMA patients do not have UMN signs, they usually do not meet the \\"World Federation of Neurology El Escorial Research Criteria\\" for ‚ÄúDefinite‚Äù or ‚ÄúProbable‚Äù ALS and so are ineligible to participate in the majority of clinical research trials such as drugs trials or brain scans. * 4) Because of its rarity (even compared to ALS) and confusion about the condition, some insurance policies or local healthcare policies may not recognize PMA as being the life-changing illness that it is. In cases where being classified as being PMA rather than ALS is likely to restrict access to services, it may be preferable to be diagnosed as \\"slowly progressive ALS\\" or \\"lower motor neuron predominant\\" ALS. An initial diagnosis of PMA could turn out to be slowly progressive ALS many years later, sometimes even decades after the initial diagnosis. The occurrence of upper motor neurone symptoms such as brisk reflexes, spasticity, or a Babinski sign would indicate a progression to ALS; the correct diagnosis is also occasionally made on autopsy. History Despite being rarer than ALS, PMA was described earlier, when in 1850 French neurologist Fran√ßois Aran described 11 cases which he termed atrophie musculaire progressive. Contemporary neurologist Guillaume- Benjamin-Amand Duchenne de Boulogne also claimed to have described the condition 1 year earlier, although the written report was never found. The condition has been called progressive muscular atrophy (PMA), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), Aran‚ÄìDuchenne disease, Duchenne‚ÄìAran disease, Aran‚ÄìDuchenne muscular atrophy, and Duchenne‚ÄìAran muscular atrophy. The name \\"spinal muscular atrophy\\" is ambiguous as it refers to any of various spinal muscular atrophies, including the autosomal recessive spinal muscular atrophy caused by a genetic defect in the SMN1 gene. =Disease or syndrome= Since its initial description in 1850, there has been debate in the scientific literature over whether PMA is a distinct disease with its own characteristics, or if lies somewhere on a spectrum with ALS, PLS, and PBP. Jean-Martin Charcot, who first described ALS in 1870, felt that PMA was a separate condition, with degeneration of the lower motor neurones the most important lesion, whereas in ALS it was the upper motor neurone degeneration that was primary, with lower motor neurone degeneration being secondary. Such views still exist in archaic terms for PMA such as \\"Primary progressive spinal muscular atrophy\\". Throughout the course of the late 19th century, other conditions were discovered which had previously been thought to be PMA, such as pseudo- hypertrophic paralysis, hereditary muscular atrophy, progressive myopathy, progressive muscular dystrophy, peripheral neuritis, and syringomyelia. The neurologists Joseph Jules Dejerine and William Richard Gowers were among those who felt that PMA was part of a spectrum of \\"motor neurone disease\\" which included ALS, PMA, and PBP, in part because it was almost impossible to distinguish the conditions at autopsy. Other researchers have suggested that PMA is just ALS in an earlier stage of progression, because although the upper motor neurons appear unaffected on clinical examination there are in fact detectable pathological signs of upper motor neuron damage on autopsy. Also, no gene has been linked specifically to PMA, and the disorder does not appear in the OMIM database. In favour of considering PMA a separate disease, some patients with PMA live for decades after diagnosis, which would be unusual in typical ALS. To this day, terminology around these diseases remains confusing because in the United Kingdom motor neurone disease refers to both ALS specifically and to the spectrum of ALS, PMA, PLS, and PBP. In the United States the most common terms are ALS (both specifically for ALS and as a blanket term) or Lou Gehrig's disease.

Intelligence service in OSS and CIA After graduating from Dartmouth College in 1940, Braden enlisted in the British Army while the U.S. was still neutral in World War II, and he saw combat in Africa in the King's Royal Rifle Corps. When the United States entered the war, he was recruited by the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and he was parachuted behind enemy lines into Nazi- occupied France. At the end of the war, with the encouragement of OSS Director William \\"Wild Bill\\" Donovan, who thought of Braden as a prot√©g√©, he and his OSS paratrooper compatriot Stewart Alsop wrote a journalistic book about the OSS, two years before it was replaced by Harry Truman with the CIA.Stewart Alsop and Thomas Braden. Sub Rosa; the OSS and American Espionage (NY, 1946); with the aid of historian Richard Harris Smith, Braden later wrote a retrospect,\\"The Birth of the CIA,\\" American Heritage (28, no. 2, 1977) After the war, Braden taught English for a time at Dartmouth, where he met Robert Frost, and he later moved to Washington, D.C., and became part of a group of well-connected former OSS men, some of whom were journalists such as the Alsop brothers, known as the Georgetown Set. In 1950, at the start of the Korean War, Braden joined the CIA and that year became head of the International Organizations Division (IOD) of the CIA's Office of Policy Coordination, the \\"covert action\\" arm of agency secret operations. He worked closely with Allen Dulles and Frank Wisner. Believing that the cultural milieu of postwar Europe was favorable toward left-wing views, he understood that the Western Allies' Establishment was rigidly conservative and nationalistic and determined to maintain their colonial dominions. The CIA estimated American supremacy to be best served by supporting the Democratic left. Thus, the program was begun to support more moderate and especially anti-Soviet leftists, thereby helping to purge the social democratic left of Soviet sympathizers. Consequently, Braden's efforts were guided toward promoting anti-Soviet left-wing elements in groups such as the AFL-CIO. Eventually, despite heavy resistance from British and French allies, the CIA made the leap toward recruiting disaffected anti-Soviet ex-communists, especially in international labor unions. Thus, from 1951 to 1954, the CIA provided $1 million a year through Braden to Irving Brown, a moderate labor leader, and it eventually recruited as an officer Jay Lovestone, a noted former communist follower of Nikolai Bukharin, who had been executed by Stalin in 1938. The CIA helped him financially to run his network with $1.6 million in 1954 (equivalent to approximately $ in dollars). After Ramparts, the flagship publication of the New Left, broke the story of the CIA's funding of anticommunist citizen groups like the National Student Association in a 1967 article, Braden defended the agency's covert work in the student and labor movements with an article, \\"I'm glad the CIA is 'immoral,'\\" in The Saturday Evening Post. Politics, government, and journalism Braden left the CIA in November 1954 and became owner of the Oceanside, California, newspaper The Blade-Tribune, which he bought with a loan from his friend Nelson Rockefeller. Active in California Democratic politics, he served as president of the California State Board of Education during the 1960s, and had a running battle with conservative Republican state superintendent of public instruction Max Rafferty. Braden himself ran for office only once, mounting an unsuccessful primary challenge in 1966 (with the campaign theme \\"Guts\\") to incumbent Democratic lieutenant governor Glenn Anderson. After the assassination in Los Angeles of his friend Robert F. Kennedy during the 1968 presidential campaign, Braden returned to Washington and became a popular newspaper columnist in partnership with Kennedy's press secretary, Frank Mankiewicz. He also became a prominent political commentator on radio and television. Although the Nixon White House initially included him on a list of friendly journalists, his work eventually landed him on the master list of Nixon political opponents. In 1975, Braden published the autobiographical book Eight is Enough, which inspired an ABC television series of the same name with Dick Van Patten in the role of Tom Bradford, the name of Braden's character in the series. The book focused on his life as the father of eight children and also touched on his political connections as a columnist and ex-CIA operative and as husband to a sometime State Department employee and companion of the Kennedy family, Joan Ridley Braden. After replacing Mankiewicz as the \\"voice from the left\\" on the syndicated radio show Confrontation, Tom Braden co- hosted the Buchanan‚ÄìBraden Program, a three-hour radio show with former Nixon aide Pat Buchanan from 1978 to 1984. He and Buchanan also hosted the CNN program Crossfire at the show's inception in 1982, with Braden interviewing guests and debating Buchanan and Robert Novak. Braden left Crossfire in 1989. Death Braden died of heart failure April 3, 2009 at his home in Denver, Colorado. He was predeceased by his wife Joan, who died in 1999, and son Tom, who died in 1994.

The Newlands Valley is in the Lake District National Park in Cumbria, England. It is regarded as one of the most picturesque and quiet valleys in the national park, even though it is situated very close to the popular tourist town of Keswick and the busy A66 road. The valley forms part of the civil parish of Above Derwent, within the Borough of Allerdale. Early history The earliest signs of human settlement in the valley have been found at Ullock, where evidence of a Bronze Age burial site has been found. The remains of a Celtic workshop were also found at Portinscale. Viking herdsmen arrived in Cumbria after 800 AD. Many of the present day place names in the Newlands valley have their origins from these early Norse settlers. The valley area was originally called Rogersat or Rogersyde which was derived from the Old Norse ‚ÄúRoger-Saetr‚Äù, which translates as Summer pasture belonging to Roger. The present day Newlands valley settlements of Keskadale, Skelgill, Birk Rigg, High Snab and Uzzicar all have their name origins from the early Viking settlers. The name ‚ÄúNewlands‚Äù did not come into being until after the 13th century when it was used to describe the usable new land which had been created at the foot of the valley between Portinscale and Braithwaite by the draining of a large swampy and marshy area. At the start of the 14th century the rents paid by the tenant farmers in the valley started to rise steadily as the cultivated areas were extended and the population increased. Some of the families in the valley have lived in the area for hundreds of years, with the Fischers, Tickells, Thwaites, Graves and Maysons all mentioned in the manorial records from the 15th century and still living in the valley in the 20th century.\\"The Story of the Newlands Valley\\", Susan Grant, Pages 6 &7 Gives early history of valley. The hamlet of Little Town seen from Catbells. It consists of a farm and few cottages Settlements The valley has a minor motor road that traverses its entire length; it starts at the village of Braithwaite on the A66 and continues over Newlands Hause to Buttermere. Another road starts at the hamlet of Portinscale (also on the A66) and joins the route from Braithwaite near the village of Stair. The valley is thinly populated, consisting mainly of farms and tourist accommodation. Stair is the main settlement in the valley and is the location of the Newlands Adventure Centre and the Swinside Inn, which is the only pub in the valley and is situated one kilometre to the north of Stair. Demolition began in 2006 of Rigg Beck, the well-known \\"purple house\\" on the main Braithwaite‚ÄìButtermere road; this large Victorian house was for many years a source of cheap accommodation for visitors (including Ted Hughes, Tenzing Norgay, Doug Scott, Tom Courtenay and Bob Hoskins). The building was destroyed by fire on 30 June 2008,.Fire destroys famous purple house at news.bbc.co.uk, accessed 3 August 2008 In its place now stands a new house built from grey stone.http://rambleswithacamera.blogspot.ae/2012/01/purple-houserigg-beck.html Further up the valley is the hamlet of Little Town, which has been made famous by the writings of Beatrix Potter, whose 1905 children's book The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle is based in the area and opens with the line \\"Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lucie, who lived at a farm called Little-town. She was a good little girl--only she was always losing her pocket- handkerchiefs!\\".Project Gutenberg. Gives text of the Tale of Mrs Tiggy-winkle. Little Town consists of a farm and a few cottages, and is the site of the small whitewashed Newlands Church, which was originally built in the 16th century but had fallen into disrepair by the 19th century. It was gradually rebuilt over a number of years and was re-opened in 1885. The stained glass window on the east wall dates from 1845, while the south facing window is a memorial to a World War I soldier. This chapel was visited by William Wordsworth in May 1826, inspiring him to write a stanza in his poem ‚ÄúTo May‚Äù, the full poem being on display in the chapel. In 2000 the chapel underwent restoration.www.thelakedistrictwalker.com. Gives details of Newlands chapel. Little Town used to have its own school ‚Äì before it was closed in 1967 ‚Äì as well as its own pub, which closed and was converted to farm buildings many years ago. Skelgill, on the slopes of Catbells, is a farm dating back to the 14th century, which includes a 12-bedded camping barn for visitors. The most southerly habitation in the valley is Keskadale farm, a traditional sheep and beef cattle farm, which has been in the Harryman family for generations and also offers tourist accommodation.www.keskadalefarm.co.uk. Gives details of farm. For car drivers, the Newlands valley ends at Newlands Hause at a height of 333 metres (1093 feet), where there is a car park at the foot of the slopes of Robinson; the Moss Force waterfall can be seen coming down from the fell. From the hause, the road descends steeply to Buttermere. The Newlands valley with Skiddaw beyond from Dale Head. Mining The Newlands Valley was extensively mined and quarried for many centuries; lead, copper, silver and even gold have been extracted over the years. The most famous mine in the Lake District is situated in Newlands. This is the Goldscope mine, on the lower slopes of Hindscarth near Low Snab farm, which has operated since the 16th century. It yielded such large amounts of lead and copper that it was called ‚ÄúGottesgab‚Äù (God's Gift) by the German miners brought over to develop the mine in its early days. The mine closed at the end of the 19th century, not because it was exhausted but because the mine's main shaft had gone so deep it had become uneconomic to pump the water from it. Other well-known mines in the valley are Barrow lead mine, on the slopes of Barrow, which closed in 1888; the Yewthwaite lead mine, which occupies a small valley between the fells of Catbells and Maiden Moor and ceased production in 1893; and the long-closed Dale Head copper mine, established by German miners in Elizabethan times. Landscape and scenery The scenery of the Newlands valley consists of farmland in the valley bottom and soaring fells above. Fells that have their foot in the valley include Barrow, Causey Pike, Catbells, Ard Crags, Knott Rigg, Maiden Moor, High Spy, Dale Head, Hindscarth and Robinson. The quality of the fell walking is very good; the Newlands horseshoe is a 14-kilometre walk, starting and finishing at Little Town, with over 1,000 metres of ascent, taking in most of the 2,000-foot peaks at the head of the valley.www.walkingenglishman.com. Gives details of Newlands Horseshoe. On the steep slopes of Ard Crags above Keskadale farm is Keskadale Oakwood, which is an ancient oak and alder woodland, a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Area of Conservation.

It was a major contributor to Australia's vertical fiscal imbalance in the spending requirements and taxing abilities of the various levels of government, and was thus a watershed moment in the development of federalism in Australia. Facts In 1942, during the Second World War, the Commonwealth government needed extra revenue for the war effort. At the time, income taxes were levied at both the State and federal level. The Commonwealth requested the States to transfer their taxing powers for the duration of the war to allow one uniform national income tax system, with grants given back to the states to compensate for the lost revenue. Doubting that the powers would be returned, the states rejected the request. In response, the Commonwealth moved to occupy the field unilaterally. As s51(ii) of the Constitution only allows the Commonwealth to impose federal taxation for federal purposes, it could not cover the field of taxation with any law. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth introduced a uniform income tax through an intricate scheme of four pieces of legislation. * The Income Tax Act 1942, raised income tax levels to the existing state levels, setting it at such a rate that made it politically impossible for states to impose their own income taxes. The amount raised was enough to cover the war effort and grants for the states * The States Grants Act 1942, provided a grant for each state equal to what it would have raised on its own income tax, on the condition that it did not raise its own income tax * Section 221 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1942, required taxpayers to meet their Commonwealth tax liabilities before state tax liabilities * the Income Tax (Wartime Arrangements) Act 1942, required that the states transfer to the Commonwealth all state staff, offices, furniture and records used to collect income tax The laws were challenged by the states of South Australia, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia. Decision The High Court held the laws were valid, despite the practical result being the inability of the states to impose income tax. The Income Tax Act 1942, was held to be valid despite the fact the rate was so high as to preclude the states from imposing income tax. As taxation is a non-purposive power, regardless of the object of the law, the subject matter was taxation, and hence valid under section 51(ii) of the Constitution. The States Grants Act 1942, was held to be valid, despite its coercive effect. The Commonwealth can use the section 96 grants power to induce a state to exercise its own powers as well as abstain from using its powers. Hence the Commonwealth can do such things to encourage or discourage a state from exercising its powers, which are technically not coercion. Indirect compulsion is constitutional. While the Act made it almost impossible for the States to continue taxing, Chief Justice John Latham noted that the states still had the choice not to accept Commonwealth grants. Justice Edward McTiernan also considered the Act valid under the defence power. Section 221 of the Income Assessment Act 1942, was held to be valid pursuant to section 51(ii) or was at the least valid under the implied incidental power. The subject matter of the law and the purpose of the law were both with respect to matters of taxation. McTiernan justified this section as valid under the defence power. The Income Tax (Wartime Arrangements) Act 1942, was upheld by a majority under the defence power. Aftermath The decision in relation to section 221 of the Income Assessment Act 1942 was subsequently overturned by the High Court in the Second Uniform Tax case..

Background  The act under question was the Financial Transactions Reports Act 1988 (Cth), which imposed an obligation on 'cash dealers' to report all transactions above $10,000 to a statutory authority. It was also an offence if it could be proved the transactions were designed to avoid tracking. The offence was a strict liability offence.  Decision  = Incidentality = Once there is a sufficient connection between the Act and the head of power, proportionality is irrelevant for non-purposive powers. Whether or not there is a sufficient connection does not rely on the desirability of the legislation. = Proportionality = It was noted that the law was disproportionate to the currency and coins power (section 51(xii)), and that it was an inappropriate means to achieving the end. (Proportionality may be examined by testing if the law is appropriate and adapted to some means.) Dawson J noted that the test of whether the measures in a law are appropriate and necessary to achieve certain objectives, while used in Europe, was irrelevant for the Australian Constitution; \\"[t]hey are essentially political rather than judicial considerations\\". Re Dingjan; Ex parte Wagner described the process by which it is determined whether a law is \\"with respect to\\" a section 51 head of power: # By reference to the rights, powers, liabilities, duties and privileges which it creates (Commonwealth v Tasmania) # A judgment as to the connection of this characterisation to the head of power Thus, the connection involves some kind of degree, but once it has been established, it does not matter whether the law is appropriate for its aims. However, proportionality may be relevant, and a law not invalid, if an immunity conferred by a limitation of a power is affected incidentally by the achievement of a legitimate end.

It runs from approximately the level of Clydach down to Swansea docks, where it opens into Swansea Bay and the Bristol Channel. This relatively small area was a focus of industrial innovation and invention during the Industrial Revolution, leading to a transformation of the landscape and a rapid rise in the population and economy of Swansea. Today the area is in the final stages of regeneration. Modern Industrial units and housing has replaced the pollution of the metallurgical industry and the area is now the home of Championship football club Swansea City A.F.C. and Welsh Rugby Union region Ospreys. Railway lines which criss-crossed the valley have now been replaced by pleasant walking and cycling paths and the River Tawe now hosts canoeists instead of copper barges. History Over a period of about 150 years up until the 1920s, the open valley of the River Tawe became one of the most heavily industrialised areas of the developed world. There were a number of reasons that favoured the great expansion of industry in this particular location. The general exploitation of coal in the South Wales coalfield of the South Wales valleys had revealed seams of steam coal and anthracite close to the surface in the Upper Swansea valley and these were easily exploited by shallow drift mining or open cast mining. Smelting metals required more than three parts of coal to every one part of metal ore, so it was of major economic benefit to have easily available, high quality coal. Swansea also had a good port and safe anchorage. The combination of these two factors meant that it was financially more viable to bring the ore to Swansea's coal than take the coal to the ore. In addition, the very high tidal ranges at Swansea allowed deep draught ships to access the river mouth. This allowed large quantities of raw materials to be brought in (allowing further profit through economies of scale) and, more importantly, the finished products, such as sheet copper, tinplate, alum, porcelain and coal to be exported. The technologies involved in iron making had already been developed and refined, and skilled craftsmen were readily available to extend the newly developing industry. Swansea was already a town of significant size which could provide the required workforce. The growth of the industry in the Lower Swansea valley itself caused a great expansion in the population of Swansea and nearby Neath. A number of wealthy entrepreneurs, scientists and engineers of considerable ability were drawn to Swansea during this period, which in turn, promoted great innovation in the industrial processes. Initially, the smelting works concentrated on copper. Coal was brought down to them by waggonways and tramways; copper ore was brought on ships which could sail right up to the works; and the resulting copper was exported out again the same way. Swansea became known as Copperopolis; and the lower Tawe valley became a mass of industry. In the wake of the copper and coal industry followed pottery-making (another industry which requires large amounts of coal, together with clay and flint, which could be shipped in from the West Country); the alum industry (based on pyrites found with coal); and the manufacture of fire-clay, which was used to line furnaces.Copperopolis: landscapes of the early industrial period in Swansea, Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales. pp 2-11. Copper The first copper smelter directly associated was established at Landore in 1717 by John Lane and John Pollard. Pollard later went on to build the Llangyfelach copper works. In 1720 the Cambrian Works was set up near the mouth of the river and continued in production until 1745. (It reopened as a pottery in 1764.) In 1737, the White Rock copper works at Pentrechwyth was established. By 1780 there were three copper works on the east bank of the river: White Rock, Middle and Upper Bank. On the west bank there was also one at Forest. By 1800 nine copper smelters were in production in the valley. By 1860 the lower Swansea valley was smelting two thirds of the copper ores imported to Britain, and changes in the output and economy of the Swansea valley had a significant effect on global copper prices. Environmental issues The extent and scale of the industrialisation that took place at a time when there almost no environmental controls in place created a legacy of chronic contamination of land and water by a great range of toxic and dangerous pollutants. The River Tawe was already being polluted by the coal mining industry and suffered badly. Even worse affected was the stream that meandered through the lower half of the valley, the Nant y Fendrod. Records about the history of this stream are sparse but it appears likely that for over 100 years most of the water was taken from this stream to be used in industry and its channel became the repository of much of the liquid waste from the various industries. In addition rainfall seeping through the growing waste tips added further burdens of by-products and waste materials. Lithographs made at the time of the boom in industrial production show a thick smog over the valleys and the nearby towns and it reasonable to suppose that air quality was very poor both in the valley floor and in the nearby residential areas. A local doctor, Thomas Williams, wrote a book called The Effects of the Copper-Smoke in 1854. He described the landscape, atmosphere, and the complaints of local farmers. Even in the 1980s when all the industry had long since disappeared the Nant y Fendrod was still very seriously contaminated by copper, iron, nickel, ammonia and many other contaminants. Recent times The only remaining working industry that can trace its roots back to the industrialisation of the Lower Swansea valley is the INCO nickel factory at Clydach known locally as The Mond. Here nickel continues (2007) to be refined using the nickel carbonyl process. The Lower Swansea Valley Project began in the early 1960s with the aim of seeking to reclaim the land. Over the next twenty years the entire community of the area became involved in restoring the land. Redevelopment of the area provided the South Dock and Maritime Quarter and the Liberty Stadium sports complex together with the Swansea Enterprise Park industrial park which included a large lake in the course of the Nant y Fendrod designed to help mitigate the concentrations of metals in the water. The lake itself is lined with limestone. Nearly all the old buildings were cleared, with only a very few of historic interest being preserved.

Its relationship with other macaws in its genus was long uncertain, but it was thought to have been closely related to the scarlet macaw, which has some similarities in appearance. It may also have been closely related, or identical, to the hypothetical Jamaican red macaw. A 2018 DNA study found that it was the sister species of two red and two green species of extant macaws. At about long, the Cuban macaw was one of the smallest macaws. It had a red, orange, yellow, and white head, and a red, orange, green, brown, and blue body. Little is known of its behaviour, but it is reported to have nested in hollow trees, lived in pairs or families, and fed on seeds and fruits. The species' original distribution on Cuba is unknown, but it may have been restricted to the central and western parts of the island. It was mainly reported from the vast Zapata Swamp, where it inhabited open terrain with scattered trees. The Cuban macaw was traded and hunted by Native Americans, and by Europeans after their arrival in the 15th century. Many individuals were brought to Europe as cagebirds, and 19 museum skins exist today. No modern skeletons are known, but a few subfossil remains have been found on Cuba. It had become rare by the mid-19th century due to pressure from hunting, trade, and habitat destruction. Hurricanes may also have contributed to its demise. The last reliable accounts of the species are from the 1850s on Cuba and 1864 on Isla de la Juventud, but it may have persisted until 1885.  Taxonomy  Study skin in Museum f√ºr Naturkunde, Berlin, one of 19 specimens in existence Early explorers of Cuba, such as Christopher Columbus and Diego √Ålvarez Chanca, mentioned macaws there in 15th- and 16th-century writings. Cuban macaws were described and illustrated in several early accounts about the island. In 1811, the German naturalist Johann Matth√§us Bechstein scientifically named the species Psittacus tricolor. PDF version Bechstein's description was based on the bird's entry in the French naturalist Fran√ßois Le Vaillant's 1801 book Histoire Naturelle des Perroquets. Le Vaillant's account was itself partially based on the late 18th century work Planches Enumin√©es by the French naturalists Comte de Buffon and Edme-Louis Daubenton, as well as a specimen in Paris; as it is unknown which specimen this was, the species has no holotype. The French illustrator Jacques Barraband's original watercolour painting, which was the basis of the plate in Le Vaillant's book, differs from the final illustration in showing bright red lesser wing covert feathers (\\"shoulder\\" area), but the significance of this is unclear. Today, 19 skins of the Cuban macaw exist in 15 collections worldwide (two each in Natural History Museum at Tring, Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle in Paris, the Swedish Museum of Natural History, and the Smithsonian Museum), but many are of unclear provenance. Several were provided by the Cuban naturalist Juan Gundlach, who collected some of the last individuals that regularly fed near the Zapata Swamp in 1849‚Äì50. Some of the preserved specimens are known to have lived in captivity in zoos (such as Jardin des Plantes de Paris, Berlin Zoo, and Amsterdam Zoo) or as cagebirds. The single specimen at World Museum, National Museums Liverpool died in Edward Smith- Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby's aviaries at Knowsley Hall in 1846. Several more skins are known to have existed, but have been lost. There are no records of its eggs. No modern skeletal remains of this macaw are known, but three subfossil specimens have been discovered: half a carpometacarpus from a possibly Pleistocene spring deposit in Ciego Montero, identified by extrapolating from the size of Cuban macaw skins and bones of extant macaws (reported in 1928), a rostrum from a Quaternary cave deposit in Caimito (reported in 1984), and a worn skull from Sagua La Grande, which was deposited in a waterfilled sinkhole possibly during the Quaternary and associated with various extinct birds and ground sloths (reported in 2008). =Related species= Painting of a specimen in Liverpool Museum (which one writer found to differ enough from other specimens to perhaps be a different species), by John Gerrard Keulemans, 1907 As many as 13 now-extinct species of macaw have variously been suggested to have lived on the Caribbean islands, but many of these were based on old descriptions or drawings and only represent hypothetical species. Only three endemic Caribbean macaw species are known from physical remains: the Cuban macaw, the Saint Croix macaw (Ara autochthones), which is known only from subfossils, and the Lesser Antillean macaw (Ara guadeloupensis), which is known from subfossils and reports. Macaws are known to have been transported between the Caribbean islands and from mainland South America to the Caribbean both in historic times by Europeans and natives, and in prehistoric times by Paleoamericans. Historical records of macaws on these islands, therefore, may not have represented distinct, endemic species; it is also possible that they were escaped or feral foreign macaws that had been transported to the islands. All the endemic Caribbean macaws were likely driven to extinction by humans in historic and prehistoric times. The identity of these macaws is likely to be further resolved only through fossil finds and examination of contemporary reports and artwork. The Jamaican red macaw (Ara gossei) was named by the British zoologist Walter Rothschild in 1905 on the basis of a description of a specimen shot in 1765. It was described as being similar to the Cuban macaw, mainly differing in having a yellow forehead. Some researchers believe the specimen described may have been a feral Cuban macaw. A stylised 1765 painting of a macaw by the British Lieutenant L. J. Robins, published in a volume called The Natural History of Jamaica, matches the Cuban macaw, and may show a specimen that had been imported there; however, it has also been claimed that the painting shows the Jamaican red macaw. Rothschild's 1907 book Extinct Birds included a depiction of a specimen in the Liverpool Museum which was presented as a Cuban macaw. In a 1908 review of the book published in The Auk, the American ornithologist Charles Wallace Richmond claimed that the picture looked sufficiently dissimilar from known Cuban macaws that the specimen may actually be of one of the largely unknown species of macaw, such as a species from Haiti. This suggestion has not been accepted. Painting of either a Cuban macaw imported to Jamaica, or the hypothetical extinct Jamaican red macaw, by L. J. Robins, 1765 The name Ara tricolor haitius was coined for a supposed subspecies from Hispaniola by the German ornithologist Dieter Hoppe in 1983, but is now considered to have been based on erroneous records. In 1985, the American ornithologist David Wetherbee suggested that extant specimens had been collected from both Cuba and Hispaniola, and that the two populations represented distinct species, differing in details of their colouration. Whetherbee stated the name Ara tricolor instead applied to the supposed Hispaniolan species, as he believed Cuba had no bird collectors prior to 1822, and that the illustration and description published by Le Vaillant were based on a specimen collected during a 1798 expedition to Hispaniola. As the Cuban species was thereby in need of a new specific name, Wetherbee coined Ara cubensis for it. He also suggested that the Jamaican red macaw was based on a \\"tapir√©\\"; a specimen whose colouration was altered through a Native American technique whereby developing feathers can be changed to red and yellow by painting them with body fluids of the dyeing dart frog (Dendrobates tinctorius). The idea that the name Ara tricolor applied to a Hispaniolan species had gained acceptance by 1989, but in 1995, the British ornithologist Michael Walters pointed out that birds had indeed been described from Cuba prior to 1822, that the supposed differences in colouration were of no importance, and that the basis of Wetherbee's argument was therefore invalid. There is no clear evidence for a species of macaw on Hispaniola. =Evolution= Since detailed descriptions of extinct macaws exist only for the species on Cuba, it is impossible to determine their interrelationships. It has been suggested that the closest mainland relative of the Cuban macaw is the scarlet macaw (Ara macao), due to the similar distribution of red and blue in their plumage, and the presence of a white patch around the eyes, naked except for lines of small red feathers. Furthermore, the range of the scarlet macaw extends to the margins of the Caribbean Sea. The two also share a species of feather mite, which supports their relationship. The American ornithologist James Greenway suggested in 1967 that the scarlet macaw and the Cuban macaw formed a superspecies with the other extinct species thought to have inhabited Jamaica, Hispaniola and Guadeloupe. A 2018 DNA study by the Swedish biologist Ulf S. Johansson and colleagues analysed the mitochondrial genome of two Cuban macaw specimens in the Swedish Museum of Natural History (sampled from their toe-pads). Though it was expected the Cuban species would form a clade with the likewise predominantly red scarlet macaw and the red- and-green macaw (Ara chloropterus), they instead found it to be basal to (and sister species of) those two large red macaws, as well as to the two large green macaws, the military macaw (Ara militaris) and the great green macaw (Ara ambiguus). The cladogram below follows the 2018 study: Painting by Philip Reinagle showing a Cuban macaw among other birds The Cuban macaw was smaller than the related extant species, and one of the smallest Ara species, which suggests smaller size may have been the ancestral state of the group, though it may also have become smaller after becoming established in the Antilles. Johansson and colleagues estimated that the Cuban macaw had diverged from its mainland relatives around 4 million years ago, during the early Pliocene. Since this is after the land bridge that is thought to have connected the Greater Antilles with South America ceased to exist, the ancestors of the Cuban macaw must have dispersed to the Antilles over open water. Therefore, the Cuban macaw was not a recent offshoot of the scarlet macaw, having a long independent history on Cuba. Johansson and colleagues therefore noted that though many of the extinct species of Caribbean macaws that had been described in the past are probably dubious, there would have been ample time for a radiation of macaws there, based on how long the Cuban species had been separated from the mainland species. A 2020 genetic study of the scarlet macaw by the American ecologist Kari L. Schmidt and colleagues resulted in a similar cladogram to that of Johansson and colleagues .  Description  Turnaround video of specimen RMNH.110095 at Naturalis Biodiversity Center, Leiden The Cuban macaw had a red forehead fading to orange and then to yellow at the nape of the neck. It had white unfeathered areas around the eyes, and yellow irises. The face, chin, chest, abdomen and thighs were orange. The upper back was brownish red with feathers scalloped with green. The rump, undertail feathers, and lower back were blue. The wing feathers were brown, red and purplish blue. The upper surface of the tail was dark red fading to blue at the tip, and the under surface of the tail was brownish red. The beak has variously been described as dark, all-black, and greyish black. The legs were brown. The sexes were identical in external appearance, as with other macaws. The Cuban macaw was physically distinct from the scarlet macaw in its lack of a yellow shoulder patch, its all-black beak, and its smaller size. About long, the Cuban macaw was a third smaller than its largest relatives. The wing was long, the tail was , the culmen , and the tarsus . The subfossil cranium shows that the length between the naso-frontal hinge and the occipital condyle was , the width across the naso-frontal hinge was about , and the width of the postorbital processes was about . Details of the skull were similar to other Ara species. The American zoologist Austin Hobart Clark reported that juvenile Cuban macaws were green, though he did not provide any source for this claim. It is unclear whether green birds spotted on the island were in fact juvenile Cuban macaws or if they were instead feral military macaws.  Behaviour and ecology  chinaberry tree Little is known about the behaviour of the Cuban macaw and its extinct Caribbean relatives. Gundlach reported that it vocalised loudly like its Central American relatives and that it lived in pairs or families. Its speech imitation abilities were reportedly inferior to those of other parrots. Nothing is known about its breeding habits or its eggs, but one reported nest was a hollow in a palm. The skull roof of the subfossil cranium was flattened, indicating the Cuban macaw fed on hard seeds, especially from palms. This is consistent with the habits of their large relatives on mainland South America and distinct from those of smaller, mainly frugivorous relatives. In 1876, Gundlach wrote that the Cuban macaw ate fruits, seeds of the royal palm (Roystonea regia) and the chinaberry tree (Melia azedarach), as well as other seeds and shoots. Cuba has many species of palms, and those found in swamps were probably most important to the Cuban macaw. The pulp surrounding the seeds of the chinaberry tree were probably the part consumed by the Cuban macaw. In 2005, a new species of chewing louse, Psittacobrosus bechsteini, was described based on a dead specimen discovered on a museum skin of the Cuban macaw. It is thought to have been unique to this species, and is therefore an example of coextinction. The feather mite species Genoprotolichus eurycnemis and Distigmesikya extincta have also been reported from Cuban macaw skins, the latter new to science.  Distribution and habitat  Zapata Swamp, 2009; the Cuban macaw lived in the area The range of the Cuban macaw's distribution at the time of European settlement on the main island of Cuba is unclear, but the species was reportedly becoming rare by the mid-19th century. It may have been restricted to the central and western part of Cuba. Most accounts from the 19th century are based on Gundlach's reports from the immense Zapata Swamp, where the species was somewhat common near the northern edge. By the 1870s, it was becoming rarer and had retreated to the interior. The subfossil skull from Sagua La Grande is the northernmost and easternmost record of the Cuban macaw. One subfossil rostrum was found in a cave. Caves are usually not visited by macaws, but the surrounding region is possibly a former swamp. The Cuban macaw had also inhabited Isla de la Juventud (previously called Isla de Pinos/the Isle of Pines) off Cuba, but the American ornithologists Outram Bangs and Walter R. Zappey reported that the last pair was shot near La Vega in 1864. Early writers also claimed it lived on Haiti and Jamaica, but this is no longer accepted. The habitat of the Cuban macaw was open savanna terrain with scattered trees, typical of the Zapata Swamp area. Cuba was originally widely covered in forest, much of which has since been converted to cropland and pastures. Lomas de Rompe, where the macaw was also reported, had rainforest-like gallery forest.  Extinction  1765 illustration by Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet Hunting has been proposed as a factor in the extinction of the Cuban macaw. Parrots were hunted, kept as pets, and traded by Native Americans in the Caribbean before the arrival of Europeans. The Cuban macaw was reportedly \\"stupid\\" and slow to escape, and therefore was easily caught. It was killed for food; the Italian traveler Gemelli Careri found the meat tasty, but Gundlach considered it tough. Archaeological evidence suggests the Cuban macaw was hunted in Havana in the 16th‚Äì18th centuries. It may also have been persecuted as a crop pest, though it did not live near dwellings. In addition to being kept as pets locally, many Cuban macaws (perhaps thousands of specimens) were traded and sent to Europe. This trade has also been suggested as a contributing cause for extinction. Judging by the number of preserved specimens that originated as captives, the species was probably not uncommon in European zoos and other collections. It was popular as a cagebird, despite its reputation for damaging items with its beak. Furthermore, collectors caught young birds by observing adults and felling the trees in which they nested, although sometimes nestlings were accidentally killed. This practice reduced population numbers and selectively destroyed the species' breeding habitat. This means of collection continues today with the Cuban parakeet (Psittacara euops) and the Cuban amazon (Amazona leucocephala). A hurricane in 1844 is said to have wiped out the population of Cuban macaws from Pinar del R√≠o. Subsequent hurricanes in 1846 and 1856 further destroyed their habitat in western Cuba and scattered the remaining population. In addition, a tropical storm hit the Zapata Swamp in 1851. With a healthy macaw population, such events could have been beneficial by creating suitable habitat. However, given the species' precarious position, it may have resulted in fragmented habitat and caused them to seek food in areas where they were more vulnerable to hunting. The extinction date of the Cuban macaw is uncertain. Gundlach's sightings in the Zapata Swamp in the 1850s and Zappey's second-hand report of a pair on Isla de la Juventud in 1864 are the last reliable accounts. In 1886, Gundlach reported that he believed birds persisted in southern Cuba, which led Greenway to suggest that the species survived until 1885. Parrots are often among the first species to be exterminated from a given locality, especially islands. According to the British writer Errol Fuller, aviculturalists are rumoured to have bred birds similar in appearance to the Cuban macaw. These birds, however, are reportedly larger in size than the Cuban macaw, having been bred from larger macaw species.

Kennedy, the invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs, the Watergate scandal, the Iran-Contra scandal, and wars and revolutions in Latin America, the Middle East, and the Far East. He was chief of the Washington bureau during the 1970s which landed him on the master list of Nixon political opponents. Biography Dudman was born in Centerville, Iowa. He majored in journalism and economics at Stanford University, where he wrote for the school paper, graduating in 1940. During World War II, he served in the merchant marines, dodging German submarines in the North Atlantic. He joined the U.S. Naval Reserve in 1942 and served four years, becoming executive officer of his ship. He started his journalism career at The Denver Post, where he wrote for four years before joining the Post-Dispatch in 1949. Dudman reported on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963. He reported seeing an entrance bullet hole in the windshield of the presidential limousine. In May 1970, he was captured by the Viet Cong and held captive in Cambodia, an experience he wrote about in his book Forty Days With the Enemy. A few days after his release, he and his wife hosted a young Bill Clinton who was working in Washington for the summer as part of Project Pursestrings. In December 1978 he was a member, along with Elizabeth Becker and Malcolm Caldwell, of the only group of Western journalists and writers invited to visit Cambodia since the Khmer Rouge had taken power in April 1975.

Biography Laurentius Surius was born in L√ºbeck in 1523.Soldatjenkova, Tatjana and Waegemans, Emmanuel. East is East, Peeters Publishers, 2003 It is not certain whether his parents were Catholics or Lutherans. According to a remark made by Peter Canisius (\\"Epistol√¶\\", ed. Braunsberger, I, 36), he was born a Protestant and was brought into the Catholic Church by Canisius. Surius studied at the universities of Frankfort- on-the-Oder and Cologne. In the latter university Peter Canisius was a fellow- student. Surius also met there Johannes Justus Lansperger, who induced him to enter the Carthusian monastery at Cologne, in 1542. The greater part of his life after this was spent in his monastery, where he was a model of piety, of rigid observance of the rules of the order, and of earnest work as a scholar; for these reasons he was held in high esteem by St. Pius V. Surius died at Cologne May 25, 1578. Works He devoted himself chiefly to the domains of church history and hagiography, and wrote a large number of works on these subjects. He also translated many works into Latin, mainly ascetic and theological texts. Among these translations should be mentioned writings by Johannes Tauler, Henry Suso, John of Ruysbroeck, Johannes Gropper's work on the reality of Christ's Flesh and Blood, the sermons of Michael Sidonius, the apologies of Friedrich Staphylus, and an oration by Martin Eisengrein. He completed the Institutiones of Florentius of Haarlem, prior of the Carthusians of Louvain, and edited a new edition of the Homiliarium of Charlemagne. He wrote against Sleidanus his \\"Commentarius brevis rerum in orbe gestarum ab a. 1500 ad a. 1564\\" (Cologne, 1566), which was continued by others. He was also the author of a collection of the Acts of the councils: \\"Concilia omnia tum generalia tum provincialia\\" (4 volumes, Cologne, 1567).Chalmers, Alexander. \\"Surius, Laurentius\\", General Biographical Dictionary, 1812 =Hagiography= His most important and still valuable work is his collection of the lives of the saints, De probatis Sanctorum historiis ab Al. Lipomano olim conscriptis nunc primum a Laur. Surio emendatis et auctis, the first edition of which appeared in six volumes at Cologne in 1570-75. He began a second edition which was finished after his death by his colleague in the monastery, Mosander, who added a seventh volume (Cologne, 1582). A third edition with an improved text appeared at Cologne in 1618; a new and revised edition was published (1875‚Äì80) at Turin in thirteen volumes. Surius did not want learning, but was willing to give credit to fabulous accounts. Notwithstanding the liberties taken by Surius with the text of the manuscripts he used, his work has rendered great service and has furnished many narratives concerning the lives of the saints that have been published in various languages.

He also appeared on the first version of Nico's 1981 album Drama of Exile. According to Pete Frame's Rock Family Trees, Payne grew up in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex and started playing the clarinet because of his enjoyment of Dixieland jazz. On hearing swing, bebop and Dexter Gordon in the 1960s he moved to London, and began taking lessons and going to jazz clubs. He also took up the soprano saxophone, and began playing in mixed media events. He was drawn into The People Band, and moved with them to the Netherlands. He met Ian Dury when he visited London in late 1970 - \\"He thought I was a junkie, I thought he was an idiot\\" - and returned to the Netherlands. After the People Band played a gig in London with Kilburn and the High Roads in 1971, he was coerced into joining them for a jam at their home, and ended up staying with the band until it broke up in June 1975. He thereafter returned to Clacton; he played two gigs with Ronnie Lane, and a few with The Fabulous Poodles. In the meantime Ian Dury launched a solo career, and Payne contributed to a few songs on Dury's first album, New Boots and Panties!!, in 1977. Payne, however, joined Wreckless Eric's band. After the completion of his album and its success, Dury badgered Payne into rejoining his band, now called The Blockheads, full-time; Payne did, and became co-composer of numerous songs in their catalogue.

Hall in 1944. Hall served as the company's president and general manager. Over the course of its operations, the company was known as, sequentially, the Hall Syndicate (1944‚Äì1946), the New York Post Syndicate (1946‚Äì1949), the Post-Hall Syndicate (1949‚Äì1955), the Hall Syndicate (1955‚Äì1967), and Publishers-Hall Syndicate (1967‚Äì1975). The syndicate was acquired by Field Enterprises in 1967, and merged into Field Newspaper Syndicate in 1975. Some of the more notable strips syndicated by the company include Pogo, Dennis the Menace, Funky Winkerbean, Mark Trail, The Strange World of Mr. Mum, and Momma, as well as the cartoons of Jules Feiffer.  History  = Background = Hall had worked for The Providence Journal during high school, followed by three years at Northeastern University School of Law and four years at Brown University. After attending the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, he was a sales manager at United Feature Syndicate, which he joined in 1935. = Foundation = During the final months of World War II, Hall began his own syndicate by distributing to newspapers several New York Post features, including Earl Wilson's \\"It Happened Last Night,\\" Sylvia Porter's finance column, \\"Your Money's Worth\\" and Samuel Grafton's \\"I'd Rather Be Right.\\" Soon, Hall developed his own features, including a variety of comic strips, Debbie Dean, Mark Trail and Bruce Gentry, along with Herblock's editorial cartoons. Added to the mix were serialized books and columns, including Elise Morrow's \\"Capital Capers,\\" Pierre de Rohan's \\"Man in the Kitchen,\\" Sterling North's book reviews, Jimmy Cannon's sports column and Major George Fielding Eliot writing on defense and tactics. The company was incorporated as the New York Post Syndicate in August 1946. New features added in 1948‚Äì49 included Walt Kelly's Pogo, the adventure strip Tex Austin, Victor Riesel's \\"Inside Labor\\" column and a facts panel, Wizard of Odds.\\"Post Syndicate Name Changed; It's Post-Hall,\\" Editor & Publisher, March 19, 1949. On March 1, 1949, the company was renamed as the Post-Hall Syndicate, Inc., and during the 1950s, it distributed the writings of Norman Vincent Peale. The name was shortened to the Hall Syndicate after Robert Hall bought out the Post in 1955. Jules Feiffer's strips ran for 42 years in The Village Voice, first under the title Sick Sick Sick, briefly as Feiffer's Fables and finally as simply Feiffer. Influenced by UPA and William Steig, the strip debuted October 24, 1956. Three years later, beginning April 1959, Feiffer was distributed nationally by the Hall Syndicate, initially in The Boston Globe, Minneapolis Star Tribune, Newark Star-Ledger and Long Island Press.Feiffer, Jules.

Robinson, 2009. (, , ) is a chain of artificial lakes under construction in Germany across the north-eastern part of Saxony and the southern part of Brandenburg. Through flooding as a part of an extensive regeneration programme, several decommissioned lignite opencast mines are in the process of being transformed into Europe's largest artificial lake district by 2018. However, the requirements of the project, especially the necessary water resources, are controversial.  Geography  The Lusatian Lake District lies in Lusatia between Calau in Brandenburg and G√∂rlitz in Saxony. The extent of what will become Europe's largest artificial lake district is an area 80 kilometres from east to west and, depending on the boundary chosen, 32 to 40 kilometres from north to south. A distinction is made between the German terms Seenland (\\"lake district\\") and Seenkette (\\"chain of lakes\\"). The \\"Lusatian Lake Chain\\" (Lausitzer Seenkette) refers to those lakes that are linked by navigable canals. They are located in the centre of Lusatia between Senftenberg and Hoyerswerda, and include Lake Senftenberg which has developed since 1973 into an important recreational and tourist centre.  Formation  The resulting gravel pit lakes: here the Ilsesee near Gro√ür√§schen Since the end of the 19th century, the area had been an industrial region, producing lignite and electricity. With the reunification of Germany in 1990, it was decided to end this long tradition because of the dwindling quantity of lignite and the heavy pollution of the surrounding environment. Although mining continues and some big power stations continue to produce electricity with lignite, all industrial activity should cease by 2020. The coal-free shore zones of the lakes Since the 1970s, some of the old pits left by the mining process have been transformed into a new landscape formerly unknown in this region. What was once a plain overgrown with heather and a few trees is now a lake district comparable to the Mecklenburg Lake Plateau in Mecklenburg or the Masurian Lakeland in Poland. It all began with the creation of the Knappensee and Lake Senftenberg, still one of the biggest lakes in the region.  Lakes  The Geierswalder See east of Senftenberg Further lakes have already been established, and plans for over twenty more large lakes have been drawn up. Lakes that have already been created include: * in the north: the Gr√§bend√∂rfer See, Altd√∂berner See and Bergheiner See * in the centre: Lake Senftenberg, Ilsesee, Sedlitzer See, Partwitzer See, Geierswalder See, Neuwieser See, Blunoer S√ºdsee, Sabrodter See, Bergener See and Spreetaler See * in the south: the Bernsteinsee, Scheibesee, Dreiweiberner See, Speicherbecken Lohse II, Silbersee/Mortkasee, Knappensee and Graureihersee. These are not the only artificial lakes that have been and will be created in eastern Germany. Around the city of Leipzig, a new lake district is starting to develop, and there are other examples, such as the B√§rwalder See and Berzdorfer See near the city of G√∂rlitz in Upper Lusatia.

It is a story about three children and their great-uncle Lancelot travelling around the world in a hot air balloon. It was published by Conran Octopus, in 1987. It is illustrated by Graham Percy. In 1989, Durrell wrote a sequel for this book called The Fantastic Dinosaur Adventure. In 2001, a children's television show was produced by Two Sides TV / TV-Loonland also called \\"The Fantastic Flying Journey.\\" The series is a 2D animation with 13 30minute episodes, based on Gerald Durrell's book. In addition to the original plot, a villain called Lucretia Moore follows Lancelot and the children in their air balloon, and tries to sabotage their attempts to find Perceval, so she can steal the magic dust. She wants it for her own benefits as the head of the world's largest pet food company. Lucretia follows the balloon with her spineless subordinate assistant in a modern helicopter. In each episode, Lucretia manages to hinder the groups travels but they always get away in the knick of time. The television series was broadcast in the UK and Australia. it is available for purchase at Amazon.com  Plot summary  One day, a hot air balloon attached to a huge straw house, lands in the garden of the Dollybutts. The fat old man who owns it is Great-Uncle Lancelot. He tells Mrs Dollybutt and her three children that he is going to find his brother, Perceval, who is lost in the jungles of Africa, looking for gorillas. Perceval, a scientist, invented a magic dust which enables people to communicate with animals. Lancelot takes the three children, Emma, Ivan and Conrad with him in the hot air balloon, which he has called Belladonna, to track Uncle Perceval. On their way, they meet several animals which they can talk to (because of the dust), such as a swallow, a camel and a fennec fox, who tell them many interesting facts about their lives. In the jungle, the gorillas tell them that Perceval left for South Africa, to meet some elephants. Lancelot and the three children follow Perceval to South Africa, and then to Australia, the North Pole, Canada, North America, Brazil and Patagonia. On their way, they meet a crocodile, a rhinoceros, some koalas, a platypus, a blue whale, some killer whales, polar bears, musk oxen, beavers, buffalos, monarch butterflies, a boa constrictor, some howler monkeys, penguins and elephant seals. Everywhere, they learn something about the animals, their habitat, behaviour and dangers threatening them. In the end, the elephant seal tells them that Uncle Perceval has returned to Britain. So they follow him there, and find Perceval in the Dollybutts' house. The chase lasted a whole year, but the children all agree it was not a waste of time after all.  Background  * Durrell based the character of Great-Uncle Lancelot on himself. His brother Perceval was loosely based on Lawrence Durrell. * The personality of the animals in the book usually reflects Durrell's opinion about those species. For examples, the gorillas have a lovable personality, because Durrell was on good terms with his gorillas at the Jersey Zoo. On the contrary, the camel is rude and nasty, because when Durrell worked at Whipsnade Zoo, he was bitten by a camel.= Category:1987 British novels Category:British children's novels Category:Books by Gerald Durrell Category:1987 children's books Category:1987 science fiction novels ","title":"The Fantastic Flying Journey"},{"id":"5664328","text":"''' \\"Ik heb zorgen\\" (\\"I have worries\\") was the Belgian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1967, performed in Dutch by Louis Neefs. The song was performed tenth on the night (following Germany's Inge Br√ºck with \\"Anouschka\\" and preceding the United Kingdom's Sandie Shaw with \\"Puppet on a String\\"). At the close of voting, it had received 8 points, placing 7th in a field of 17. The song deals with Neefs' worries, which are caused by a love interest. The lyrics are often the subject of humour, as the chorus features the Dutch lines \\"Oh oh, ik heb zorgen, oh oh, ik heb zorgen/Oh oh, ik heb zorgen en dat verveelt me zo\\", with the phrase \\"en dat verveelt me zo\\" being variously translated as \\"And that worries me a lot\\" and \\"And that bothers me a lot\\", both of which sound odd in English. Des Mangan in fact translates the lyric as \\"And that bores me a lot\\", which further adds to the surreal effect. Neefs also recorded the song in English (as \\"I Got Troubles\\") and German (\\"Ich habe Sorgen\\"). It was succeeded as Belgian representative at the 1968 Contest by Claude Lombard performing \\"Quand tu reviendras\\".

Owned by the Times Mirror Company, it also operated the Los Angeles Times Syndicate International; together the two divisions sold more than 140 features in more than 100 countries around the world. Syndicated features included Pulitzer Prize-winning commentators and columnists, full news and feature services, editorial cartoons and comic strips, online products and photo and graphics packages.  History  The syndicate was founded in c. 1949 by the Times Mirror Company as the Mirror Enterprises Syndicate. In the early 1960s the name was changed to the Los Angeles Times Syndicate, and was operated as a department of the Los Angeles Times newspaper. Rex Barley was manager of the syndicate from 1950 until at least 1968. The syndicate acquired the New York City-based independent syndicate General Features Corp. in 1967 for approximately $1 million, retaining it as a separate entity.\\"Times Mirror Company And General Features,\\" New York Times (January 4, 1967), p. 84. In 1974, the L.A. Times Syndicate absorbed General Features into its own operations. In mid-1987, the Los Angeles Times Syndicate was the fifth-ranked syndication service, with 85 features. In 2000, upon completion of the merger with the Tribune Company, it became a division of Tribune Media Services. The New York office closed June 1, 2000, while the Salt Lake City office closed on August 31, 2000. International work continues to be done in Los Angeles through the Tribune Content Agency. Several of the employees were offered follow on jobs with Tribune Media Services after the closing.  Comic strips and panels  Neither iteration of the syndicate ever produced a breakout comic strip; the most successful strips ‚Äî Luther, Napoleon and Uncle Elby, Mr. Tweedy ‚Äî tended to be inherited from other syndicates. Most Mirror Enterprise strips didn't last more than two or three years, and the company appeared to give up on syndicating comic strips after circa 1961. After a five-year hiatus, the newly named Los Angeles Times Syndicate picked up the distribution of comic strips again in 1965. It had a similar lack of long-term success, with most strips not lasting more than three of four year in syndication. The most popular strips that originated with the L.A. Times Syndicate were Ed Nofziger's Animalogic (11 years in syndication) and Lee Nordling's Sherman on the Mount (9 years). The syndicate also distributed Lou Grant's editorial cartoons from the 1950s through the 1980s. = Mirror Enterprises Syndicate (c. 1949‚Äìc. 1961) = * Annie Oakley by Bill Ziegler (1950‚Äì1952)\\"Bill Ziegler,\\" Who's Who of American Comic Books: 1928‚Äì1999.

Rabbis sitting on the various Moetzos are usually either one of the more prestigious Roshei Yeshiva (heads of yeshivas) or Hasidic rebbes who are also usually regarded by many Haredi Jews to be the Gedolim (\\"great/est\\") sages of Torah Judaism. Before the Holocaust, it was the supreme authority for the World Agudath Israel in Europe.  Name  The component words of the name are transliterated in a variety of ways. This is frequently done as Moetzet, and less frequently as Gedolai and ha-Torah or ha Torah. The phrase is regularly shortened to Moetzes or The Moetzah.  History  = In Europe = Prior to World War II, only one such body existed, the World Agudath Israel . The Council of Torah Sages was established following the establishment of Agudath Israel in Katowice in 1912.\\"The General Assembly of the Agudath Israel Committee\\", Hatzfira, October 29, 1912 It was decided at the time that two councils would be set up for the movement: a council of homeowners, and a council of rabbis,\\"Agudat Yisrael assembly in Katowice\\", Moria, June 14, 1912 composed of leading rabbis from around the world.Asher Reichel, \\"Igrot Rabbi Yitzchak Isaac HaLevi\\", Mossad Harav Kook, p. 66, on the HebrewBooks site = In the United States = The Moetzes of Agudath Israel of America serve as religious decisors, leadership, and political and policy liaisons with state and federal government agencies on behalf of many American Haredi Jews. The council, consisting primarily of rosh yeshivas and Hasidic rebbes, directs Agudath's policies and leadership. Formerly known as the Moetzet Chachmei HaTorah, the body was founded in 1948. It sets all major policies, and guides the organization according to its precepts of Da'as Torah. = In Israel = The Moetzet (usually transliterated with an ending \\"t\\") of Agudat Yisrael likewise constituted the Israeli Ashkenazic Haredi community's religious policy leadership, and exercises strong control over political matters for strongly observant Israelis, such as joining government coalitions. Prior to Degel HaTorah's late 1980s break from Agudat Israel (because of the dominance of the Polish Hasidic groups), there was only one Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah in Israel. With the breakaway (led by Rabbi Elazar Shach), two separate, at times complementary, councils were created. The Haredi Sephardi Jews of Israel had also at one time followed the leadership of the Moetzet of Agudat Yisrael when it was still a body that generally spoke for most of Israel's Haredim. Eventually, however, the Haredi Sephardim broke with their Ashkenazi counterparts (again because of the dominance of the Polish Hasidic groups), and established the Moetzet Chachmei HaTorah (\\"Council of [wise] Torah Sages\\"), which in turn became the source for the formulation and expression of the policies and agenda of the Shas political party in the Israeli Knesset. Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef became the main leadership figure of this council.  Members of the Council  = Pre-World War II = In Katowice were appointed to the council Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Alter (1866‚Äì1948) Rebbe of Ger (Chairman), Rabbi Sholom Dovber Schneerson Rebbe of Chabad, Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik, Rabbi Yitzchak Isaac Halevy, Rabbi Meir Simcha of Dvinsk, Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grodzinski, Rabbi Itzela of Ponevezh, Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Breuer, Rabbi Ze'ev Feilchenfeld of Posen, Rabbi David Zvi Hoffmann, Rabbi Kopel Reich of Budapest.\\"Agudath Israel assembly in Katowice\\", Moria, June 18, 1912 At the great congress in Vienna in 1923, the Council included: the Chofetz Chaim, the Gerrer Rebbe, Rabbi Yisroel Friedman the Chortkov Rebbe, Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grodzinski, Rabbi Meir Arik, Rabbi Yitzchak Zelig Morgenstern the Admor of Sokolov ,Rabbi Mordechai Yosef Elazar Leiner the Admor of Radzin, Rabbi Meir Dan Plotzky, Rabbi Moshe Mordechai Epstein, Rabbi Meir Shapira of Lublin, Rabbi Avraham Mendel Steinberg of Brod, Rabbi Kalman Weber of Piestany, and Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Breuer.See \\"In Agudath Israel\\", Doar Hayom, May 5, 1929 In 1937, the members of the Council were: Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Alter, Rabbi Yitzchak Menachem Mendel Danziger of Aleksander, Rabbi Dovid Bornsztain of Sochatchov, Rabbi Avraham Yaakov Friedman of Sadigura, Rabbi Mordechai Shalom Yosef Friedman of Przemysl, Rabbi Elchonon Wasserman, Rabbi Aharon Levin, Rabbi Aharon Kotler, Rabbi Ben Zion Yoezer (Rabbi of Turda and President of the Federation of the Association of Ultra-Orthodox Communities in Romania), Rabbi Dov Ber Av Beit Din of Ozarkov, Rabbi Moshe Blum Av Beit Din of Zamosc, Rabbi Zalman Sorotzkin, Rabbi Yehuda Leib Tsirelson, Rabbi Yosef Tzvi Dushinsky, Rabbi Menachem Ziemba, Rabbi Mordechai Rotenberg, Rabbi of Antwerp, Rabbi Akiva Sofer, and Rabbi Shmuel Dovid Ungar.

In 1997 it was fully integrated into Brunel University. Lancaster House, Osterley campus  Establishment  West London Institute was created in 1976 from the merger of Borough Road and Maria Grey teacher training colleges and Chiswick Polytechnic. Borough Road College, on the Osterley campus, dated back to 1889 in that location, and to 1798 in its previous home on Borough Road in Southwark. As a College of Higher Education from 1976, West London received funding from local government, and it had to perform adequately in the higher education sector. It was placed under the direction, as Principal, of a sport psychologist and former physical education lecturer, Professor John Kane OBE, and a geographer Murie Robertson, who served as Vice-Principal. It awarded undergraduate degrees (CNAA) and HNDs, and continued to train teachers, being, for example, a specialist 'Wing College' for Physical Education. Operating over two campuses, one on St. Margarets Road in East Twickenham, alongside the River Thames, and the other immediately south of the Great West Road in Osterley. The Borough Road name persisted on the rugby field and on the Institute's sports strip. References: www.brunel.ac.uk ‚Ä∫ about ‚Ä∫ PDF ‚Ä∫ INFO- SHEET-BRC  The 1980s  By the 1980s the degree and diploma programmes at WLIHE were being delivered through a variety of disciplines. The Borough Road College campus in Osterley was home to American Studies, English Literature, History, Religious Studies, Geography, Geology, Business Studies, Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy, Social Work, and Sports Studies, while the Arts, Music, and Education were clustered two miles away at the old Maria Grey College site in East Twickenham. For a number of years, the Colleges were affiliated to The University of London's Institute of Education and therefore offered University of London degree courses. By the 1990s the courses offered were mostly joint honours awards in various combinations including: American Studies, Drama, Art, French, Business Studies, English Literature, Geography, Geology, History, Religious Studies, Music and Sports Studies, plus single- honours degrees in Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy, and Social Work. By the 1990s a few Masters programmes were also offered; for example, in Sport Sciences (the first in Greater London), Social Work, and Environmental Change. A small number of PhDs were also awarded across the disciplines. The British and Foreign School Society kept an archive and ran a National Religious Education Centre on the Osterley site. The Twickenham site also hosted a ballet school, the Rambert. For its size and status (Higher Education colleges in the UK were not really expected to be high research performers), the Institute performed relatively well in research, with several departments achieving national recognition in the Research Assessment Exercises of the 1980s and 1990s (1992 result here) ‚Äì WLIHE also did well in the 1996 assessment ‚Äì and a few staff held national research awards from the ESRC and other bodies.  The merger with Brunel University  A merger approach by the Vice-Chancellor of Brunel University, Professor Michael Sterling, went amicably ‚Äì WLIHE had expertise and subject areas that Brunel did not. In 1995 WLIHE ceased to exist. For the next two years, its campuses and departments were known as Brunel University College, under the stewardship of a Provost, Prof. Eric Billett, and then simply as Brunel University from 1997. This status prevailed for about 6 years, before Brunel decided to centralise all of its operations on its Uxbridge campus, 8 miles away. By this time, many departments had already moved from Osterley to Uxbridge. The East Twickenham campus, which contained several older buildings and had a riverfront location, was sold off in 2005 and was largely demolished and converted into luxury housing. Its central building, Gordon House, was on the market for 2 years at ¬£15,000,000 after being sold once. It has been renamed Richmond House, even though it is not in Richmond.http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for- sale/property-24364233.html  Alumni  * Denys Baptiste Jazz musician (tenor saxophone) and composer * Steve Bates England Rugby international scrum-half (1989) * Nigel Bevan GB Olympic Games (1982) Javelin * Kevin Bowring Wales National Rugby Union coach (1995‚Äì98); RFU Director of Professional Coach Development (2002‚Äì16) * Judith Burne GB Rowing, Coxless Four, World Championships (1985 & 1986) & Commonwealth Games Gold medal (1986) * Garry Cook GB Olympic Games Silver medalist, 4 √ó 400 m (1984), and World Championships 800m (1983) * Greg Davies stand-up comedian and actor * Abi Ekoku CEO and Rugby League player, Bradford Bulls; Discus thrower, UK Champion, GB/England ‚Äì European Championships/Commonwealth Games * Justin Fitzpatrick Ireland Rugby international prop forward (1998-03) * Brett Garrard GB & England Hockey international, Olympian (2000 & 2004); GB and England's most capped player * Julian Golley GB Olympic Games (1992) & England Commonwealth Games Gold medalist (1994) Triple Jump * Audley Harrison MBE GB Olympic Games (2000), Gold medal, Boxing (Super-heavyweight division) * Mark Hatton GB Winter Olympian (2002 & 2006) Luge * Dave Heaven Jazz guitarist * Toby Hessian GB Rowing LtWt Coxless Fours, World Championships Gold Medal (1991) * Richard Hill MBE British & Irish Lions (1997)/England Rugby international (1997-09); World Cup winner with England 2003; currently the England National Rugby Union Team Manager * Patricia Hodge OBE, actor; Olivier Award 2000 * Julie Hollman GB Olympic Games, Heptathlon (2008), World Championships (2003) and England Commonwealth Games (2002 & 2006) * Paul Honeyford a successful author and linguist * Eddie van Hoof GB Gymnastics, Olympic Games (1984) & UK Coach of the Year 2016 * Ben Johnston England Rugby international centre three-quarter (2002) * Alex King England Rugby international fly-half (1997-03) * John Mallet England Rugby international prop forward (1995) * Mark Naylor GB High Jump, Olympics (1980 & 1984) * John Olver England Rugby international hooker (1990‚Äì92) * David Ottley GB Javelin, Olympics Silver medal (1984), Commonwealth Games Gold medal (1986) & World Championships (1987) * Mark Pearn GB & England Hockey international; Olympian (2000 & 2004) * Courtney Rumbolt GB Four-man Bobsleigh, Bronze medalist, Winter Olympics (1994) * Kathy Smallwood-Cook MBE 13 medals at the Olympics, World Championships, European Championships, and Commonwealth Games in Athletics (sprints; 1978‚Äì84) * Kelly Sotherton MBE; Bronze medalist in Heptathlon at Olympic Games and Gold at the Commonwealth Games * Paul Stimpson GB & England Basketball, played over 120 times for GB and England and captained England * Linda Strachan GB Fencing (Foil), Olympic Games 1988 & 1992 * Ian Taylor GB Hockey goalkeeper and Olympic Gold medalist (1988) * Iwan Thomas MBE Silver medalist for 400 m at the Commonwealth Games (2002); European 400 m champion (1998), Gold medalist in the 4 √ó 400 m relay at the European Championships (1998); Silver medallist in the 4 √ó 400 m relay at the Olympics (1996) and a member of the winning 4 √ó 400 m relay team at the World Championships (1997); current TV presenter * Darren Treasure Sport Psychologist & High Performance Director for the Nike Oregon Project; Associate Professor Arizona State University & Honorary Professor Bath University. * Ian Tullett GB & England Pole Vault; Silver medalist, Commonwealth Games (1990) * Jeremy West GB Canoeing, Olympic Games & two Gold medals at the World Championships (1986) * Anthony Whiteman GB Olympian (1996 & 2000); winner of the 1500 m, World University Games 1997; Master's world record holder for 800 m * Alan Whitwell GB Rowing, three Olympic Games, Silver medal Men's Eight (1980), & World Championships, Lightweight Double Sculls Gold medallist (1986) * Jason Wing GB Four-man Bobsleigh, Winter Olympics (1994), & European Championships Silver medalist (1994) * Greg Whyte (sportsman) OBE GB Modern Pentathlon Olympian (1992 & 1996), won World Championship silver & European bronze (1991); Professor of Applied Sport & Exercise Science, Liverpool John Moores University Former notable staff include: * Prof. Gavin D'Costa theologian, University of Bristol * Danny Kerry MBE GB Women's Hockey Head Coach, led the team to Olympic Gold medal (2016) * Em.

She also learned Kathak dancing in her childhood. Sahasrabuddhe's musical mentors included Balwantrai Bhatt, Vasant Thakar, and Gajananrao Joshi. Later she also trained briefly under Gaansaraswati Kishori Amonkar. She had a bachelor's degree in vocal performance, Sanskrit literature, and English literature from Kanpur University (1968), a master's degree (Sangeet Alankar) in vocal performance from A.B.G.M.V. Mandal (1969), and also master's degree in Sanskrit from Kanpur University (1979). A.B.G.M.V. Mandal conferred on her a doctorate in vocal music (Sangeet Praveen) in 1988. For some years she was the head of the department of music at SNDT Pune campus. A renowned vocalist, she performed all over India and in several countries around the world.  Childhood / early days  Her father Shankar Shripad Bodas was a contemporary of Omkarnath Thakur and Vinayakrao Patwardhan, and one of the earliest students of Vishnu Digambar Paluskar who founded the famous Gandharva Mahavidyalaya. Bodas was specially deputed by Paluskar to move to Kanpur from Mumbai and spread music. Bodas and Shanta migrated to Kanpur in 1926, founded a Sangit Samaj and began teaching students, inviting other performers and propagating music. The Paluskar tradition was essentially in the Gwalior Gharana style and temperament of singing. Kanpur was an industrial town without any notable cultural life, particularly classical music. Until then, Uttar Pradesh had other places such as Banaras and Allahabad where music thrived. Veena's mother Shanta was also a singer and taught music in local schools in Kanpur. Veena grew up in this musical atmosphere at home. In addition to training from her father, she also trained with her brother Kashinath.  Death  Veena tai gave her last concert on December 2, 2012. She was diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy, a rare degenerative neurological condition that affects one in a thousand people. This disease has no known cure. She died on June 29, 2016.

He has also written on globalization. Life Barr McClellan lived in Maracaibo, Venezuela, in 1944‚Äì1951. He spent time in the oilfield swamps and learned soccer. He also survived an airline crash in Mexico City in 1946. He graduated from Jefferson High School in San Antonio in 1957 (class president, graduation speaker), then enrolled at the University of Texas in Austin where he won the O. Henry and William Jennings Bryan literary awards. He graduated with honors, BA, with special honors in international studies, 1961, JD, 1964. In 1966, McClellan joined a legal firm in Austin, Texas. At that time, the firm was run by a number of partners, including Edward A. Clark. In 1972, McClellan became a full partner in the firm. After one year as University Attorney, McClellan established his own law firm in 1977. Some of McClellan's cases included litigation for exploding Ford Pintos, tobacco-caused expenses on the health care system and the licensing and regulation of cell phones.\\" McClellan was reported to be a \\"staunch conservative\\". He was a lobbyist for the Southern Union Gas Company. McClellan's first wife was former Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts Carole Keeton Strayhorn.

McClellan and his wife live in Gulfport, Mississippi. Blood, Money & Power: How LBJ Killed JFK In 2003, McClellan's book Blood, Money & Power: How LBJ Killed JFK was published by Hanover House. The book presents the theory that McClellan's former employer, Edward A. Clark, and President Johnson conspired to have President Kennedy assassinated. According to L. D. Meagher's review for CNN: \\"[McClellan] fabricates scenarios he never witnessed and invents conversations he was not party to in order to weave his yarn. Anything resembling evidence is relegated to sometimes-incomprehensible footnotes, and a jumble of photos and documents included as an appendix. And what evidence there is would be laughed out of any court in the world.\\" Meagher added: \\"Blood, Money & Power is just the kind of book Warren Commission defenders point to when they issue blanket denunciations of all conspiracy theories.\\" Publishers Weekly wrote that McClellan's \\"evidence is meager and murky, even by the standards of Kennedy conspiracy scholarship\\", and that \\"[t]he book offers many detailed accounts of conspiratorial meetings that turn out to be not fact but... conjecture designed to distract readers from the lack of evidence.\\" Their review concluded: \\"His confusingly structured, evasively argued, often nonsensical theories attest to the crime's continuing potency as a symbol of America's mythic heart of darkness.\\" Vincent Bugliosi has called McClellan's account \\"blasphemous and completely false\\".

It was an uninspired design, but it did boost the anti-aircraft capacity in Norway significantly when adopted. Background and design The patent drawing of the 7.5 cm L/45 M/16 anti-aircraft gun Early in World War I, the Norwegian Army realised that aircraft were a threat that needed to be countered. At first, attempts were made to mount existing field guns on new mounts to allow high angle fire, but it was soon obvious that a more specialised weapon was needed. Attempts were made to buy British and French guns, but both nations needed the weapons themselves because of the ongoing war. The history of the M/16 can be traced to a letter from the Norwegian Ministry of Defence dated 17 December 1915. After initial design work had been carried out, it was decided to manufacture one prototype and 12 production weapons. The detailed design work took longer than anticipated, and with the end of the war, any urgency seemed to leave the project. As a result, the prototype was not ready for test firing until 20 May 1920. The M/16 was a relatively simple design. It was intended for static emplacement, and was mounted on a pedestal, allowing for 360¬∞ sideways movement. The mount allowed for an angle of elevation of between -1¬∞ and 75¬∞. The gun barrel was 45 calibres long, and had 28 grooves (rifling) twisting to the right. The breech block was a semi-automatic horizontal-wedge - the gunner had to manually open it to remove the case from the previous shot, but it closed automatically on the insertion of a new round. There was a Hydro-pneumatic recoil cylinder under the barrel, with a heavy spring to aid the forward motion of the gun at high elevation. It was originally designed to fire under local command, but was later equipped to receive gun-laying information from a central sight. The gun was also equipped with a device for automatically adjusting the time fuses on the shells. The M/16 was served by a crew of nine: The gun commander, one soldier for sideways adjustment, one for adjusting the elevation, one to operate the breech block and fire, one loader, one 'fuse adjusting device operator', one 'fuse adjuster' and two to fetch ammunition and take away the empty cases. Service history and fate A total of 12 production guns were built. Further production was curtailed because of the perceived low risk of war in the 1920s; by the time the need for more anti-aircraft artillery was obvious in the 1930s, the design was outdated. The M/16 was employed in the static defence of the various military installations in Norway. The weapons were moved around as priorities shifted, but at the time the Germans invaded Norway on 9 April 1940, six guns were mounted near Bergen, four were mounted at the Naval base in Horten; the remaining two were near Oslo along with more modern weapons, such as the 7.5 cm L/45 M/32, to defend the capital. The guns at Horten could have taken part in the battle that occurred in the harbour between Norwegian and German ships (see the article on HNoMS Olav Tryggvason for details), but due to unclear lines of command and the unprepared state of the crew, the guns were captured before any shots could be fired in anger. In Bergen, the M/16 was used to try to shoot down German bombers attacking military targets, but the aircraft flew too low for the guns to be of much use. After the main fortification in Bergen surrendered to the Germans, the anti-aircraft batteries were ordered to stand down. In Oslo, the two M/16s were mounted in a battery at Gressholmen - a small island in the harbour - and were ideally placed to take part in the battle for Fornebu. Norwegian sources claim this battery shot down one or two German bombers, despite the fact that the crew was untrained (17 out of the 44 men had been in uniform for only six days) and several became shell-shocked or deserted their posts. In addition to this and other problems, one of the guns jammed early-on in the engagement. The fate of the M/16s after the Germans captured them is unknown, but it is likely they were used to further the German cause in Norway during their occupation of Norway.

The company began with ¬•37.5 billion of capital. It had around 80 employees at the time. It added 340 online accounts during its first hour of operation. At the time, the company offered yen-deposit accounts, investment trusts, card loans, and bank payments. It hoped to expand into foreign currency deposit accounts, credit cards, and housing loans by 2002. It also hoped to allow its customers to use automated teller machines from the Japan Post. In 2001, Sony Bank hoped to accumulate 400,000 customers by 2004. In February 2001, the company had hoped to accumulate $5.2 billion in deposits; it adjusted that figure downward to $4.1 billion in deposits three months later. In February 2001, the company aimed to gain $8.6 billion in deposits by 2006. Analysts at the time were generally upbeat about the prospects for the bank. Raymond H. Graber of TowerGroup suggested the bank could synergize with the other operations of Sony Financial.

Ownership Upon the bank's founding in 2001, Sony owned 80% of the bank. By 2005, its stake had risen to 84.2% and Sony Financial Holdings became the intermediate holding company of the bank. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group owned a 16% initial stake in the company and allowed Sony Bank customers to access its 7,600 automated teller machines. Sony Group is considered to be a Mitsui keiretsu. Sumitomo Mitsui had reduced its share to 12.6% by 2005. Upon the bank's founding in 2001, JPMorgan Chase owned a 4% stake in the bank. JPMorgan had hoped to expand its asset and wealth management services in Japan. The company reduced its ownership to 3.2% by 2005. It sold off its entire stake in 2005, claiming to have discussed the move with Sony in advance. By the divestiture made by JP Morgan, Sony increased its ownership to 87.4%.

This dry run allowed the planners of the Jamboree to test a number of aspects of the event, including the control of the massive influx of the contingents into the area. The food and supplies for the EuroJam event also set a world record for the largest single internet order to a supermarket, with deliveries being made in large articulated trucks. Scouts Shops Ltd, responsible for sourcing much of the equipment for the 21st World Jamboree, reported that the cost of steel on the world market increased as a result of the Jamboree placing its order. =International Service Team= A Ferris wheel built by the Swedish contingent The International Service Team (IST) were Scouts aged 18 and above who help to build large-scale Scouting events, the most notable being World Scout Jamborees. They arrived one week before the beginning of the actual event for preparation. There were over 8,600 members of the IST at the 21st World Scout Jamboree, and they helped to build, run, take down and maintain the events, activities and services on the Jamboree site. The IST were split into two main sections, with four sub-sections, depending on their interests and qualifications: * On-Site IST looked after on-site services, events and activities. * Off-Site IST looked after Splash!, the water activities day, Gilwell Adventure, activities at the home of Scouting, and Starburst, the community projects day. Including water, gas and electricity, the IST built and maintained the fifth largest city in Essex from a park in under a month. UK Contingent Pre-Event Party The entire UK contingent arrived one day before the rest of the world, and had a party on the Tropical Hub stage with performances from Liberty X and Lemar, along with Radio 1 DJ Jason King and CBBC TV presenter Anne Foy. Peter Duncan, UK Chief Scout, was also on the stage. Controversy 21st World Scout Jamboree neckerchief After the Jamboree closed, it was revealed that thirteen Scouts had been reported missing to the British Police. All the organisations involved maintain there has been no crime committed, as all the Scouts had visas, and were only concerned for the Scouts' safety. Concerns were raised by local people in Chelmsford after Hylands Park hosted the Jamboree and V Festival 2007 just a week apart, causing disruption to local roads and exacerbating the negative effects on the park found after hosting the annual music festival.

In Central Georgia Metropolis, Lt. Harvey Greer investigates the destruction of two surrogates. Greer soon discovers a mysterious figure (whom he nicknames ‚ÄúSteeplejack‚Äù) plots to permanently disable all surrogates in an effort to eliminate people's dependence on them.Surrogates #1 (2005) Greer considers the anti-surrogate religious leader named ‚ÄúThe Prophet‚Äù a suspect, but The Prophet is later killed by Steeplejack.Surrogates #3 Similar to Steeplejack and The Prophet, Greer feels people have become too reliant on surrogates for superficial reasons. Greer chooses to work the investigation in-person after Steeplejack destroys Greer's surrogate.

It was the first film to be given an X rating for its sex scenes,All About the VIXEN and was a breakthrough success for Meyer. The film was developed from a script by Meyer and Anthony James Ryan. The film concerns the adventures of the oversexed Vixen (Gavin), as she sexually manipulates everyone she meets. The story's taboo-violations mount quickly, including themes of incest and racism. Plot In the heart of the Canadian wilderness, sultry and sexually assertive Vixen Palmer, quickly becomes bored when her husband Tom, wilderness guide/pilot leaves for the mountains. The hypersexual Vixen vents her frustration by attempting to seduce anyone within reach including a couple her husband brings home as clients (separately), a Mountie, and eventually her own brother, Jedd. The film finally veers into political satire as Vixen's racism and the creeping threat of Communism are discussed at length among the characters as the film draws to its end. At the end of the film, her husband brings another couple home and Vixen smiles, apparently planning to seduce them. Production Erica Gavin was a dancer in clubs who knew women who had acted in other Meyer films. She answered an advertisement seeking actors for Vixen and was cast.http://www.retrocrush.com/archive2006/ericagavin/ Meyer recalled, \\"Bravely I went up to the location for Vixen without a leading lady and left a couple of my henchmen to try to find somebody. It's always difficult. But Erica had a curious quality about her. She didn't have the greatest body, you know. She didn't have the up-thrust breasts like the others. \\" The film was shot in Miranda, California. During the film, George Costello had a relationship with Gavin, which led to the end of Costello's professional relationship with Meyer. Meyer said the sex scene between Gavin and her brother \\"was the best of them all. She [Erica Gavin] really displayed an animal quality that I've never been able to achieve before - the way she grunted and hung in there and did her lines. It was a really remarkable job... I've done a lot of jokey screwing but there's something about Erica and her brother that was just remarkable... [it] really represents the way I like to screw.\\" Reception The film was a huge box office success. Meyer later attributed this to the fact \\"it was so frank for its time. And a lot of it had to be attributed to Erica Gavin. She had a quality that also appealed to women. And women came in great numbers.\\"Russ Meyer: Ten Years After the 'Beyond' Ebert, Roger. Film Comment; New York Vol. 16, Iss. 4, (Jul/Aug 1980): 43-48,80. Meyer later elaborated: > I think an awful lot of women would have liked to have been able to act like > Vixen a few times in their lives. To have an afternoon in which they could > have laid three guys, have an affair with their best girl friend, that would > straighten a lot of people out... Everything she [Vixen] touched was > improved. She didn't destroy, she helped. If there was a marriage that was > kind of dying on the vine, she injected something into it which made it > better...

Meyer's ability to keep his movies light and farcical took the edge off the sex for people seeing their first skin-flick. By the time he made vixen, Meyer had developed a directing style so open, direct and good-humored that it dominated his material. He was willing to use dialogue so ridiculous... situations so obviously tongue-in-cheek, characters so incredibly stereotyped and larger than life, that even his most torrid scenes usually managed to get outside themselves.

Career  Leopold was Captain in the 2nd Regiment Orange-Nassau. During the French occupation, he was also the governor of The Hague. After the French troops, under the command of Charles-Fran√ßois Lebrun, 1st Duke of Plaisance, had fled the country, he took over the rule of the Netherlands, together with Gijsbert Karel van Hogendorp and Frans Adam van der Duyn van Maasdam. They were called the Driemanschap. In this temporary government, count Leopold was Minister of War and thus responsible for preventing anarchy and also making sure the Netherlands wouldn't be annexed to Prussia or England. The three statesmen invited the almost forgotten prince William VI of Orange, the later King William I, to The Hague to establish the monarchy. On November 30, 1813 Limburg Stirum welcomed the prince on the beach of Scheveningen and on December 6 the provisional government offered him the title of King. William refused, instead proclaiming himself \\"sovereign prince\\". He also wanted the rights of the people to be guaranteed by \\"a wise constitution\\". He became king William I of the Netherlands in 1815. He confirmed count Leopold as governor of The Hague and named him lieutenant general. On the 8th of July 1815, Leopold van Limburg Stirum was named Knight Grand Cross in the Order of the Netherlands Lion, a title reserved for members of the Royal Family, foreign Heads of State and a select group of former prime ministers, Princes and Cardinals. In 1828 he became general of the infantry. From 1833 until his death, he was member of the Senate.  Family  He first married in 1782 Theodora van der Does, Lady of Noordwijk (born 1758, died 1793). They had four children: * Wilhelmina Frederica Sophia, countess van Limburg Stirum (born 1784, died 1870); * Wigbold Albert Willem, count van Limburg Stirum Noordwijk, baron de l'Empire, (born in 's-Hertogenbosch 16 April 1786, died in 's-Gravenhage 15 January 1855), member of the notabelenvergadering (1814), member of the Senate, Knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion. He married in 1811 Maria Margareta Elisabeth, Baroness van Slingeland (born 1790, died 1834); *Otto Jan Herbert, count van Limburg Stirum (born 1789, died 1851). He married (1st) in 1814 Josephine Arnoldine baroness Rengers (born 1789, died 1839); (2nd) in 1843 Sophia Augusta von Buchwald (born 1814, died 1890); * Frederik Govert, count van Limburg Stirum (born 1790, k.a. Leipzig 1813). In 1801 he married Maria van Styrum (born 1763, died 1848).

The film, which was directed by Guy Green, is about a patrol of the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) during the North African Campaign in the Second World War. It was shot on location in the Kingdom of Libya. Plot On the eve of the Battle of El Alamein, Captain Tim Cotton leads a patrol on a raid to destroy a German fuel dump located deep behind enemy lines. Captain Williams of the Royal Engineers is posted to Cotton's patrol to deal with a minefield surrounding a German petrol dump. As a regular soldier, Williams takes time to adjust to the non- regulation way the LRDG operates. He finds a girl's torn up picture in Cotton's billet, who dismisses her as \\"old news\\". Later on Williams shows Cotton a picture of his son; Cotton says he has everything to live for. The mission, which begins with five Chevrolet 30 cwt trucks, starts with a perilous journey through Axis-occupied Libya where the LRDG encounter Luftwaffe spotter planes and Africa Korps patrols. Six of their men are killed and two of their Chevrolets are destroyed by a German armoured car. On reaching the German supply depot, Williams does his job and creates a path through the minefield with the help of Corporal Mathieson. The rest of the group destroys the stocks of petrol but Sergeant Hardy is killed in the escape. However hidden within the dump is a large number of German panzers. Unfortunately Cotton cannot report this to base because the radio is smashed in a German ambush, during which 'Blanco' White is wounded in the leg. Knowing the importance of the information, the group knows they must return and report it to base while there is time for it to be acted upon. During their return journey they are relentlessly pursued by a German officer determined to stop them. When two half-tracks attack them Cotton is wounded in the arm and Sergeant Nesbitt is killed. Eventually - with just 40 miles to go to the Allied base - the last truck runs out of fuel. Blanco volunteers to stay behind and man a Vickers machine gun, Brody offers to stay with his friend but Cotton says \\"Everyone who can goes on\\". While the others head towards base, Blanco sacrifices himself slowing up the last pursuing German halftrack. The group, with their water exhausted, sight another LRDG patrol on a truck. But before they can signal them, the chasing Germans are spotted. Williams grabs a Sten gun and leads the Germans away from his group. His actions allow the LRDG patrol to outflank and destroy the half-track; however, he is killed. Cotton laments that he had everything to live for. The film concludes with Cotton reporting the tanks to his CO back at base. They also speak of Williams and the sacrifice he made for the group. The opening barrage of El Alamein starts. Cast * Michael Craig as Captain Tim Cotton * John Gregson as Captain Bill Williams R.E. * Richard Attenborough as Trooper Brody * Percy Herbert as Corporal \\"Blanco\\" White * Barry Foster as Corporal Mathieson * Vincent Ball as Sergeant Nesbitt * Andrew Faulds as Sergeant Parker * George Murcell as Corporal Simms * Ray McAnally as Sergeant Hardy * Harold Goodwin as Road Watch * Tony Thawnton as Captain Tom * Wolf Frees as German Sergeant * George Mikell as German Officer * Martin Benson as German Half-track Officer (uncredited) * Dermot Walsh as Commanding Officer (uncredited) Production  =Writing= The screenplay of Sea of Sand was written by noted author and screenwriter Robert Westerby. The film's technical advisor was Bill Kennedy Shaw, who served as the LRDG's intelligence officer during desert campaign in North Africa. =Soundtrack= The score was by Clifton Parker and was performed by the Sinfonia of London under the musical direction of Muir Mathieson. =Filming= The film was shot in Tripolitania near to many sites that saw real action during the war in North Africa. Most of the European extras in the film were British Army personnel who were stationed in Libya because of the military alliance between King Idris of Libya and the West (this relationship ended following the 1969 coup d'etat by army officers led by Muammar Gaddafi). As such, most of the military props used in the film are derived from British or American equipment. For instance the Allied troops use contemporary Chevrolet 30 cwt WB trucks mounted with Vickers machine guns. But the use of Sten submachine guns was incorrect (the real LRDG used either the .303 SMLE or the Thompson submachine gun as small arms). Likewise American half-tracks, fitted with British Bren guns, were employed to portray Africa Korps Sd.Kfz. 251s. Reception The film was nominated for BAFTA awards for Best Film and British Film and Best British Actor for Michael Craig. Variety praised the \\"excellent all-round acting and taut direction by Guy Green,\\" and concluded, \\"Green and cameraman Wilkie Cooper splendidly capture the remote loneliness of the vast desert, the heat, the boredom and the sense of pending danger. The screenplay is predictable, but the dialog is reasonably natural and the various characters are well drawn.\\" =Box Office= Kinematograph Weekly listed it as being \\"in the money\\" at the British box office in 1958.

The route number had previously been used for a service to Putney in the 1920s prior to the formation of the London Passenger Transport Board. In 1957, the route was used as the basis for a New Scientist magazine study into congestion on London streets. Vehicles on the central section of the route between Euston and Hyde Park Corner were found to spend 68% of their time in motion, and only 11% on loading and unloading passengers.The New Scientist - 6 June 1957 - Google Books result The late 1980s saw revisions to the Northern end of the route. On 7 February 1987, the main route was cut back to run between Putney Heath Green Man and Euston (or Tottenham Court Road station Monday to Saturday evenings). The Sunday services consisted of a morning extension to Hornsey Rise, and a further extension to Turnpike Lane station, via Crouch End, on Sunday afternoons, with meal relief journeys running to Wood Green Garage. The withdrawn Euston to Hornsey Rise section was replaced by a new route 14A (now route 91). On 26 September the off peak Monday to Friday service was withdrawn between Tottenham Court Road and Euston. The Sunday afternoon service was withdrawn between Crouch End and Turnpike Lane on 26 March 1988. Upon being re-tendered, London General commenced a new five-year contract from 23 November 2002. Midway through, on 23 July 2005, the AEC Routemasters were replaced by Volvo B7TL Wright Eclipse Gemini buses and on 13 January 2007, it was extended from Tottenham Court Road to Warren Street.

On 23 January 1966, the route was once again given a Sunday extension, this time to Streatham Bus Garage and by 15 February 1969 the Sunday route was renumbered 19A, which was reverted to 19 by March 1971. The Sunday extension was finally withdrawn on 8 January 1972. Later that year, on 15 July, the Sunday service was cut back to Clapham Junction. During August 1972, the AEC Regent III RTs were replaced by AEC Routemasters. It was not until 5 October 1974 that the Sunday service reverted to Tooting Bec, following the withdrawal of route 19A. During 1975 garage journeys were extended to Tufnell Park, with the whole route being extended further to Archway by 1984. On 3 August 1985, the route was withdrawn between Finsbury Park and Archway. On 24 April 1993, route 19 became the first Routemaster operated service to be awarded to a company that was not a subsidiary of London Buses Limited following the route being awarded to Kentish Bus after a competitive tender. Kentish Bus painted their Routemasters in a cream and maroon livery with route branding. Following nearly five years with Kentish Bus, operation transferred to Arriva London South in January 1998, with the Sunday service operated by sister Arriva company Grey-Green. A departure from the cream and maroon livery saw a return to the traditional London Bus red to comply with a contractual requirement for London buses to be 80% red. A little over a year later, and after a period of 14 years, the Sunday allocation reverted to crew operation using Routemasters from Battersea. The Brixton allocation was retained for some early and late journeys run off the N19. In August 2002, in preparation for the introduction London congestion charge, the service was increased from 18 Routemasters to 26. The extra buses were released from route 13. On 2 April 2005 the route was converted to one man operation with 28 new Wright Pulsar Gemini bodied DAF DB250LFs.Team 19 Relegated London Bus Routes 1 April 2005 Although Battersea was able to house all of the Routemasters needed to run the route, the newer and longer buses presented capacity problems, with six buses being outstationed at Norwood garage.Battersea's Roite 19 celebrates 100 years of service Arriva London Upon being re-tendered, route 19 passed to London General‚Äôs Stockwell Garage on 31 March 2012 with new Wright Eclipse Gemini 2 bodied Volvo B5LHs and B9TLs.New routes gained following tender successes Bus Talk (Go-Ahead London) issue 10 August 2011 On 28 March 2015, part of the route's allocation was transferred to Northumberland Park.

Upon being re-tendered, the route was won by Arriva London who resumed operating it on 1 April 2017. \\"Arriva sees success in latest London tender results\\" Coach & Bus Week issue 1255 30 August 2016 page 9Bus Service Changes 11 March to 16 April 2017 Transport for London 24 March 2017 New Volvo B5LH/Wright Eclipse Gemini 3s are in use on the route. New Routemasters cascaded from Route 48 were introduced on 12 March 2019. In popular culture Route 19 has been mentioned at various points in popular culture. In Graham Greene's novel The Ministry of Fear (1943), which he classified as an \\"entertainment\\", the protagonist, Arthur Rowe, catches \\"a number 19 bus from Piccadilly\\" to Battersea in the London of the Blitz and observes how the bombs have struck some areas and spared others: \\"After the ruins of St James's Church, one passed at that early date into peaceful country. Knightsbridge and Sloane Street were not at war, but Chelsea was, and Battersea was in the front line\\" Greene, Graham (1943; 1973). The Ministry of Fear. Harmondsworth: Penguin, p. 81. Kate Millett writes in the first chapter 'Fugue state' in Flying (1974) of her journey through Chelsea and Soho riding in the top of the No. 19 bus, with two other mentions of it in the book; The 1978 Dire Straits song Wild West End (about the London area of the same name) contains the line \\"And my conductress on the number 19...\\". The route is also referenced in the first line of Rudie Can't Fail by The Clash.

The gallery hosts a wide variety of British paintings, watercolours and contemporary artworks. The largest collection is known as the John & Elizabeth Wait Collection. Past exhibitions at the gallery have attracted controversy. In 2008 a painting of a naked woman smoking was removed from display after a complaint from a bishop.

Nearby towns include Swifts Creek, Ensay, and the major town of Bairnsdale. At the 2016 census, Benambra and the surrounding area had a population of 149. The Town Frontage of the Benambra Hotel, including advertising sign for the long defunct Courage beer brand Benambra town centre is at the intersection of Gibbo Street and Limestone Road, at an altitude of approximately 700m. The town has a population of around 150, although most residents live on farms and properties out of the actual town. From its early days Benambra has been regarded as a premier agricultural area, specialising in both sheep and cattle farming. The annual weaner calf sales, held in March, attract buyers from across Australia who are seeking high quality predominantly Hereford and Hereford Shorthorn Cross calves on offer. Merino sheep are raised for wool, and there is a small amount of cropping in the area. The timber industry employs a small number of people in harvesting, handling and transportation of the logs to mills in other areas. Mining was once also a significant employer in the area, but only occasional forays are currently conducted. For the tourist, the area offers beautiful mountain scenery, crystal clear trout fishing streams, and an assortment of picturesque bush walking trails, including those of the Alpine National Park. The town of Benambra is on the shores of Lake Omeo which can also serve as a tourist attraction, however this lake only irregularly holds water at present. During wetter times a pier and public toilets were built at the top end of the lake furthest from the town where the lake is at its maximum depth. The depth varies when full from about 3m at the top end to about 1m at the town end, where the lake will flood across the sealed road. When holding sufficient water, the lake has hosted sailing, and, later, speed boat races; the last speed boat races were held on Australia Day in January, 1975. History The Omeo Plains near Benambra from Mount Blowhard Boating on Lake Omeo, Benambra, 1892 A rusting 1961 EK Holden at a former garage in Gibbo St. is an echo of more affluent times Benambra was one of the first regions of Victoria to be settled by Europeans; this was during the period of 1834-1836, the same time that the first settlements were being made in Melbourne and also at Portland in the state's south-west. The Aboriginal history from this area is not especially well recorded. There was a mountain clan, the Ja-itma-thang, centred on the Omeo area, but this clan would have interacted regularly with nearby tribes, including the Gunai or Kurnai of Gippsland proper. Population levels are uncertain, but were likely highly underestimated by European settlers, especially with consideration given to the fact that observation in the mountains and forests of Gippsland is far more difficult than in the more open parts of Australia. What is clear is that like elsewhere, population levels quickly declined following European occupation due to both disease and conflict, and people from this clan are no longer found in the area. Unlike most of Australia, where exploration typically went inland from the sea, the Gippsland region was first explored and settled by Europeans who came overland from the Monaro region of New South Wales and headed down to the coastal regions. This could perhaps be seen as a natural expansion of the first settlements of Australia radiating out from Sydney, but to do so the settlers had to cross the not insignificant barrier of the Australian Alps. In fact the first to arrive via this route were not explorers in the traditional sense, but ordinary stockmen pushing out to expand their range. The route they initially found put them in the Omeo region, with access largely through present day Benambra. First to arrive was James MacFarlane in late 1834, and in 1835 he returned with two other Highland Scots, George MacKillop and Livingstone, all settling on the Omeo Plains (which stretch from east of Benambra westwards to Omeo). MacFarlane then returned to the Monaro and brought cattle back to the Benambra area in 1836 (which at the time they called Strathdownie). This formed Gippsland‚Äôs first squatting run. The Scots were soon followed by four Irish cattlemen from the Monaro. John Pendergast was at Lake Omeo (in Benambra) by 1836, John Hyland took up a run at Hinnomunjie (a locality between Benambra and Omeo), Edmund Buckley moved to Tongio Munjie and Ensay, south of Omeo, in 1836, and his stepson, Patrick Buckley, was at Benambra by 1839. Many of these surnames are still common in the area. By the time of 1839 and 1840 wealthy landholders in New South Wales had become interested in the Gippsland region and funded further exploration of the region. The key explorations around this time were those of another Scot, Angus McMillan, and a Polish scientist-explorer, Count Paul Strzelecki. Both of these expedition parties passed through the then established lands around Benambra and Omeo heading south towards the coast, and both were assisted by the McFarlane family. McMillan completed several expeditions, and while he was not necessarily the first to visit many locations, his explorations were the most important in terms of European settlement of Gippsland proper. On his final expedition he located a suitable port for the region, at present day Port Albert. The route established then by McMillan remains essentially the same major north-south route through Gippsland to this day. This route follows the Great Alpine Road south through the Tambo Valley to Bruthen, then west to Bairnsdale and Sale along the Princes Highway, then south from Sale to Port Albert. For several decades Gippsland operated essentially on this north-south axis, following this route from Benambra and Omeo to Port Albert, but in the 1860s a road was opened from Melbourne to the east, and this was followed a couple of decades later by a rail line and a Post Office opened on 16 June 1886. These developments, along with development of significant east-west shipping on the Gippsland Lakes at the time, reoriented travel and transport to the simpler east-west axis, and demoted the Benambra and Omeo regions to a side branch of this main route. Facilities (past and present) The main street of Benambra In line with most small country towns the population of Benambra has been in gradual decline over recent years. The town itself has always been relatively small in terms of facilities, in line with its population and the relatively short distance and easy access to nearby Omeo. Into relatively recent times Benambra supported a primary school, a number of sporting teams and other facilities, including a traditional country pub, the charming Presbyterian (now Uniting) Church erected in 1905, a community hall, a ‚Äòneighbourhood house‚Äô, a police station, and a number of small commercial outlets, such as a general store, bank and garage. Many of these facilities continue to this day in some form. Education Benambra Primary School opened on 3 October 1876, initially under the name ‚ÄòOmeo Plains East‚Äô. The school came about as a result of an application put before the Victorian Board of Education by a group of pioneers in the district. In its first year the school had 19 students ranging from Grades 1 to 4. The teacher was provided with a house in Benambra‚Äôs main street, Gibbo St. A number of other schools were opened in the area over time to serve what was in the past a larger and less mobile population involved in farming and mining. Benambra Primary School was the last surviving of the schools on the Omeo Plains, with children transported to the school by a small bus from outlying areas such as The Brothers and Uplands until as recently as 1998. Benambra Primary School continued until 2002 when the enrolment was nine students, and closed at the end of that year when projected enrolments for the following year dropped to as low as one student. Benambra Primary School is officially still a going concern under the caretakership of the Benambra Neighbourhood House, however it seems unlikely at this stage that it will ever again open for students. From 2003, local children have been bussed to Omeo Primary School, with secondary students making the daily 100 km round trip to Swifts Creek School. Occasional short courses are run for the community at the Benambra Neighbourhood House, however older students wishing to undertake more formal tertiary study can do via the Swifts Creek Outreach Centre for TAFE or must travel considerable distances to nearby towns such as Bairnsdale, or relocate to larger towns or cities. Sports Town sign at southern (Omeo road) entrance to town The town formerly had an Australian rules football team nicknamed ‚ÄòThe Bloods‚Äô competing in the Omeo & District Football League (ODFL), as well as an affiliated netball team competing in the associated netball competition. They fielded senior and junior football teams, and senior, junior and midget netball teams. The Benambra colours were red and white. Benambra football jumpers consisted of a red vee on a white background, essentially the design of what was once the South Melbourne VFL football club, and now the Sydney Swans AFL club. The netball club wore a white top with red skirt. With its increasingly smaller population Benambra began struggling to fill its sporting teams, particularly with large teams such as football, but for a time was able to extend its playing lists with a good supply of imported players from other towns and districts. With further declines in populations in the district, in 2007 the football and netball clubs merged with neighbouring town Omeo to form the Omeo-Benambra (Alpine Ranges) Club.

They are called Pfeffern√ºsse (plural, singular is ) in German, pepernoten (sing. pepernoot) in Dutch, p√§pan√§t in Plautdietsch, pfeffernuesse or peppernuts in English, and pebern√∏dder in Danish. History While the exact origin of the cookie is uncertain, the traditional Dutch belief links the pepernoten to the feast of Sinterklaas, celebrated on 5 December in The Netherlands and 6 December in Germany and Belgium. This is when children receive gifts from St. Nicholas, who is partially the inspiration for the Santa Claus tradition. In Germany, the pfeffernuss is more closely associated with Christmas. The cookie has been part of European yuletide celebrations since the 1850s. The name peppernut (Pfeffern√ºsse, pebern√∏d etc.) does not mean it contains nuts, though some varieties do. The cookies are roughly the size of nuts and can be eaten by the handful, which may account for the name. Ingredients Throughout the years, the popularity of the pfeffern√ºsse has caused many bakers to create their own recipes. Though recipes differ, all contain aromatic spices - most commonly cinnamon, cloves, mace, nutmeg, cardamom, and anise. Some variations are dusted with powdered sugar, though that is not a traditional ingredient. Molasses and honey are also used to sweeten the cookies.Caruso, Aimee. ‚ÄúPfeffernusse: Spicy Holiday Cookies.‚Äù Retrieved 21 July 2013 For the dough, most versions still use 19th century ingredients such as potassium carbonate and ammonium carbonate as leavening agents to get the sticky and dense consistency of the original mixture. It is then either kneaded by hand or through the use of an electric mixer.  Regional variation  *In northern Germany, pfeffern√ºsse are a hemispherical pastry up to two centimetres in diameter and of firm consistency. *The northern Moppen variant are larger and softer, based on a gingerbread-like dough, and have an icing glaze. *In southern Germany, the dough is made with lemon and orange peel, often also almonds. *In Saxony, they are about three centimetres, uncoated and angular. *The Netherlands has two styles. Kruidnoten are round and hard; pepernoten are angular and chewy. Klein describes old Dutch _pepernoten_ as tougher than German _pfeffern√ºsse_ , but contrasts them with crisp _kruidnoten_. *There are some recipes passed down by families of German Mennonite origin that call for peppermint extract rather than the traditional spices, making for a light minty flavor. These cookies are cooked to be soft and coated in powered sugar. Specific origin of this variation is unknown. Kruidnoten and Russian Tea Cakes Pfeffern√ºsse are commonly mistaken for kruidnoten or spicy nuts in English. While they are both famous holiday cookies, the kruidnoten are harder, have a darker brown color, and have a different shape. Their ingredients are more similar to the ones used in making speculaas. Russian tea cakes are also confused with pfeffern√ºsse, especially when dusted in powdered sugar.

It was directed by Sidney Lanfield and released by 20th Century-Fox. It is among the best-known cinematic adaptations of the book, and is often regarded as one of the best.The Hound of the Baskervilles (1939) at Turner Classic Movies The film stars Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes, Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson and Richard Greene as Henry Baskerville, Wendy Barrie as Beryl Stapleton. Fox was unsure of the potential of a film about Sherlock Holmes, so top billing went to Richard Greene and not to Rathbone. The Hound of the Baskervilles marks the first of the fourteen Sherlock Holmes films starring Rathbone and Bruce as Holmes and Watson, respectively. It is also notable as the earliest known Sherlock Holmes film to be set in the Victorian period of the original stories. All known previous Holmes films, up to and including the 1930s British film series starring Arthur Wontner as Holmes, had been updated to a setting contemporaneous with the films' release. Lionel Atwill returned as Moriarty in Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon (1942) and Morton Lowry in Pursuit to Algiers (1945) as Sanford. Mary Gordon was in ten films of the series.https://www.imdb.com/search/title?roles=nm0001651,nm0330435&title;_type=feature,tv_episode,video,tv_movie,tv_special,mini_series,documentary,game,short Plot Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) and Dr John H. Watson (Nigel Bruce) receive a visit from Dr. James Mortimer (Lionel Atwill), who wishes to consult them before the arrival of Sir Henry Baskerville (Richard Greene), the last of the Baskervilles, heir to the Baskerville estate in Devonshire. Dr Mortimer is anxious about letting Sir Henry go to Baskerville Hall, owing to a supposed family curse. He tells Holmes and Watson the legend of the Hound of the Baskervilles, a demonic dog that first killed Sir Hugo Baskerville (Ralph Forbes) several hundred years ago (seen in flashback) and is believed to kill all Baskervilles in the region of Devonshire. Holmes dismisses it as a fairy tale, but Mortimer narrates the events of the recent death of his best friend, Sir Charles Baskerville, Sir Henry's uncle. Although he was found dead in his garden without any trace of physical damage, Sir Charles's face was distorted as if he died in utter terror, from heart failure. He alone had noticed footprints at some distance from the body when it was found; they were the paw marks of a gigantic hound. Holmes decides to send Watson to Baskerville Hall along with Sir Henry, claiming that he is too busy to accompany them himself. Sir Henry quickly develops a romantic interest in Beryl Stapleton (Wendy Barrie), the step-sister of his neighbour Jack Stapleton (Morton Lowry), a local naturalist. Meanwhile, a homicidal maniac (Nigel De Brulier), escaped from Dartmoor Prison, lurks on the moor. Holmes eventually makes an appearance, having been hiding in the vicinity for some time making his own investigation. An effective scene, not in the original book, occurs when Watson and Sir Henry attend a seance held by Mrs. Mortimer (Beryl Mercer). In a trance, she asks, \\"What happened that night on the moor, Sir Charles?\\" The only reply is a lone howl, possibly from a hound. After some clever deception by Holmes, he surmises that the true criminal is Stapleton, a long-lost cousin of the Baskervilles, who hopes to claim their vast fortune himself after removing all other members of the bloodline. Stapleton kept a huge, half- starved, vicious dog (played by a Great Dane) trained to attack individual members of the Baskervilles after prolonged exposure to their scent. However, when the hound is finally sent to kill Sir Henry Baskerville, Holmes and Watson arrive to save him just in time. They kill the hound. Stapleton then traps Holmes down in the hound's underground kennel, and sends Watson into the moor to meet Holmes. Holmes cuts his way out of the kennel and returns to the house and destroys the poison that Stapleton had just given to the wounded Baskerville. Stapleton pulls a gun and flees. Holmes says ominously, \\"He won't get very far. I've posted constables along the roads and the only other way is across the Grimpen Mire.\\" Holmes is praised for his work on the case, and he turns in.

He was the last member of the House of Commons to hold a Military Cross for action during the Second World War. Background and education Robert Boscawen was the fourth son of Evelyn Hugh John Boscawen, eighth Viscount Falmouth, of Tregothnan, by his wife Mary (n√©e Meynell, descended from the Earls of Halifax) A member of a very old Cornish family, his ancestors included Prime Minister Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, and Admiral Edward Boscawen, victor over the French at the Battle of Lagos. Boscawen was educated at West Downs School and Eton College. Military career Too young for military service at the outbreak of the Second World War, Boscawen went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he read mechanical science and took the special army engineering course. In 1941, he joined the Royal Engineers. However, on 4 September 1942, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the 1st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards (with which members of his family had served since 1769, including his brothers George and Evelyn, who had been killed during the evacuation from Dunkirk), and his service number was 243507. The battalion formed part of the 5th Guards Armoured Brigade, part of Major General Allan Adair's Guards Armoured Division, and Boscawen was sent to the cavalry wing of Sandhurst to train as a tank commander. In September 1944, after having fought in the Battle of Normandy, his battalion were among the first tanks to enter Brussels and he was awarded the Military Cross (MC) in the battle to relieve Arnhem. In April 1945, during the last month of the war, he was very seriously wounded and sustained disfiguring burns when a shell pierced his tank. He was evacuated to Archibald McIndoe's pioneering \\"Guinea Pig Club\\" plastic surgery unit at Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead, Sussex, spending much of the next three years in hospital. He is the author of Armoured Guardsmen, a book which follows the Coldstreamers through France, Belgium and Holland, in 1944/45. Political career Boscawen served during 1947 and 1948 in Hamburg, West Germany, with the British Red Cross civilian relief teams organised by his mother, Lady Falmouth, a vice-chairman of the Conservative Party. From 1948, he spent two years with Shell Petroleum as a management trainee before joining the family-owned Cornish china clay business, Goonveen, at Rostowrack. He became a Lloyd's underwriter in 1952. Boscawen's party political career began in 1948 when he joined the Young Conservatives. Boscawen contested Falmouth and Camborne in elections in both 1964 and 1966, achieving a swing to the Conservatives but not enough to win, and was subsequently deselected because of his support for the right-wing Monday Club: local party activists thought his membership of the Club would harm his ability to appeal to a traditionally radical-leaning seat. For thirteen years, from 1970 until 1983, he was the member for Wells and then, as the result of boundary changes, his constituency became Somerton and Frome, which he held for a further nine years, from 1983 to 1992. In Parliament, Boscawen was noted for his right-wing views. He supported the restoration of capital punishment and drastic cuts in the welfare state and student grants but opposed abortion. He also became a leading supporter of Ian Smith after Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence. He voted against the imposition of sanctions in defiance of the Party Whip. He was also initially opposed to Britain's entry into the European Common Market but later tentatively supported it, warning opponents against using war memories to make decisions affecting future generations. Boscawen was interested in the National Health Service and sat on its London Executive Council from 1954 to 1965. Also, he was on the backbenchers' Health Services Committee and vice- chairman from 1974 to 1979. He was scathing about attempts to raise MPs' pay in 1976 at a time of financial hardship for many, saying it \\"brought ignominy\\" on the whole House. Boscawen served as an assistant whip from 1979, as a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury from 1981, and then Vice Chamberlain of Her Majesty's Household 1983-86 and finally Comptroller of the Royal Household until 1988. He became a member of the Privy Council in 1992, in the same year that he retired from the House of Commons. Personal life Boscawen married Mary Codrington in 1949 and they had two daughters and one son, who followed him into the Coldstream Guards. They lived at Ivythorm Manor in Street, Somerset. Boscawen was a rower and yachtsman. He stroked the Trinity boat and rowed in the University trial eights. He was a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron and regularly sailed in international races, including the Fastnet. Boscawen died on the Isle of Wight on 28 December 2013.\\"Hon Robert Boscawen Obituary\\", The Times, 8 January 2014 References Bibliography *Boscawen, Robert.

War Marshal), Swedish: f√§ltmarskalk) is officially not an active military rank but an honorary rank that can be bestowed upon 'especially distinguished generals'. So far the only holder of this title has been Baron Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, then Chairman of the Defence Council, who received it on 19 May 1933 by the decision of the State Council. Baron Gustaf Mannerheim (1867-1951) served as Regent 1918-1919 and President of the Republic 1944-1946\\\\. Lieutenant General Mannerheim had commanded the White Army in the Finnish Civil War in 1918, and his promotion to field marshal had already been suggested in 1928, the 10th anniversary of the end of the War. Back then the proposal was rejected as 'too warlike'--and there was also fears that such promotion would prove politically controversial‚Äîbut Mannerheim was nevertheless given an unofficial marshal's baton by the Civil War's White veterans. Five years later the political climate was more favourable, and the State Council decided to bestow Mannerheim the rank of field marshal. The decision was kept in secret, and came as a pleasant surprise to Mannerheim. He observed \\"In a little ultrademocratic country it could seem quite pretentious to indulge in the luxury of a field marshal\\", but also admitted that it was \\"not so frightful when the marshal costs the state nothing\\". It is not known why field marshal never became a substantive rank rather than honorary one, but this distinction caused Mannerheim some consternation at the time. He had to pay a substantial stamp duty of 4000 Finnish marks. Mannerheim's secretary at the Defence Council, the then Lieutenant Colonel Aksel Airo, tried to make the Defence Forces or Ministry of Defence foot the bill. It is customary that the organization that has originally put a person forward for the title, pays the stamp duty that comes with it. But in this case no such payer could be found and finally Airo had to present the bill to Mannerheim, who commented wryly: \\"It's good they didn't make a bigger chief out of me.\\" Mannerheim was also initially concerned that as field marshal was not an official rank, he was no longer in the Defence Forces service, but Mannerheim was then assured that he remained in the Finnish Army officer lists as a general of cavalry (ratsuv√§enkenraali, his substantive rank since 1918). Mannerheim received the field marshal's title three days after the 15th anniversary of the end of the Civil War, choosing not to receive the title on the anniversary on 16 May, because he did not want to aggravate the wounds of the War. On this occasion Mannerheim was also given a new, official marshal's baton, but he still preferred to use the old, unofficial one, because it was lighter. In practice field marshal was treated like a military rank. Mannerheim, in co-operation with artist and author Aarno Karimo, designed a new rank insignia consisting of the three heraldic lions of a full general and crossed marshal's batons.Since the introduction of the rank of prikaatikenraali (brigadier general) in 1995, the Finnish Defence Forces' full general's rank insignia has consisted of four heraldic lions. On Mannerheim's 75th birthday 4 June 1942 he was bestowed the title of Marshal of Finland (Finnish: Suomen marsalkka, Swedish: Marskalk av Finland) that has been specially created for him, although it was fully symbolic title and his rank insignia remained the same. At the time when Finland was under Swedish rule (before the War of Finland in 1808-1809), a number of Finnish-born men reached the corresponding rank of F√§ltmarskalk.

In 1971, Nicole & Hugo had entered into the national final for the Eurovision Song Contest and won the final with \\"Goeiemorgen, morgen\\". Prior to their departure to Dublin for the contest, Nicole fell ill and the duo were unable to attend. They were replaced in their absence by Jacques Raymond and Lily Castel, but returned to the Contest with \\"Baby, Baby\\" in 1973. The song was performed second on the night, following Finland's Marion Rung with \\"Tom Tom Tom\\" and preceding Portugal's Fernando Tordo with \\"Tourada\\". At the close of voting, it had received 58 points, placing 17th (last) in a field of 17. The backing singers include Belgium's 1968 Eurovision representative, Claude Lombard. The song itself is a rather straightforward love duet, with the duo pledging their love to each other in a variety of languages (and making the somewhat unusual comment that \\"the divorce doesn't hurt at all\\"), however it has achieved something of a cult status among Contest fans. Much of this is due to the purple jumpsuits worn by both performers and the unusual dance moves they performed during the song. There is also a level of appreciation for what in recent times often has been described as \\"a relatively tacky song\\", \\"a Eurovision turkey\\" and the duo itself as if \\"suffering from sort of curse\\".O'Connor, John Kennedy: The Eurovision Song Contest - The Official History, page 53.

Scotsman James Anderson joined James Thompson & Co. in 1828, his nephew James George Anderson joined the firm in 1854, and by 1863 it had been restyled Anderson, Thompson & Co. With the death of the last member of the Thompson family it was in 1969 restyled Anderson, Anderson & Co. The inauguration of a liner service to Australia with the packet Orient in 1866 saw the company trade as The Orient Line of Packets, regularly shortened to Orient Line. In 1877, Anderson, Anderson & Co. approached the Pacific Steam Navigation Company with a proposal to put some of its excess tonnage, laid up after being built for an overly ambitious weekly service to the west coast of South America, onto the Australian run. The first sailings of the Pacific S.N. Co. steamers Lusitania, Chimborazo and Cuzco under the Orient Line banner proved so successful that Anderson, Anderson & Co. approached the Green family, shipowners and shipbuilders of Blackwall Yard London, with a proposal to purchase them. Anderson, Anderson & Co. and Greens then jointly founded the Orient Steam Navigation Company, with a capital of ¬£44,642, early in 1878. They built a series of large seagoing steamers for the trade, commencing with the four-masted, two-funnelled Orient in 1879. =Early 20th Century= SS Otranto in 1909 A close association with the Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Company began at the turn of the 20th century with the two companies sharing an Australian Government mail contract. Each company had a vessel sailing from England to Australia every two weeks, resulting in a weekly service of fast mail ships. This was at a time of rapid expansion for the Orient Line, with a succession of larger ships being built. All had names starting with 'O', such as , Osterley, , , Ortona and Orvieto ‚Äì a quintet of 12,000-ton ships ‚Äì entering service in 1909. The First World War saw all of the company's ships commandeered for war service, with several losses. Those that survived returned to the England ‚Äì Australia service in 1919. For many years, Sir Kenneth Anderson and Sir Frederick Green (1845‚Äì1927) alternated annually as Orient Line chairman, until Greens sold out their interests to Lord Inchcape when P&O; acquired a 51% controlling interest in the Orient S.N. Co. in 1919. A new firm, Anderson, Green & Co. Ltd., acquired the other 49% and then managed the Orient Line on its new owner‚Äôs behalf until the subsidiary was formally absorbed into its senior partner in 1966 following P & O's acquisition of the balance of the shares. Anderson, Green & Co. Ltd. then became a shipbroking firm until renamed Anderson Hughes following further rationalisation in 1975. =Between the Wars= Norddeutscher Lloyd's D/S Zeppelin, later Orient Line's SS Ormuz The Orient Line fleet was upgraded following the war with the purchase of second-hand former German vessels from the British Government, made available through war reparations. They included the which Orient bought in 1920, had refitted and renamed Ormuz, and ran between Great Britain and Australia from 1921 until 1927. More new ships were acquired in the second half of the 1920s, most built at the Vickers Armstrong shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness. The company managed to trade through the Great Depression and returned to profitability and new ship building in the mid-1930s. The company engaged a New Zealand-born marine architect, Brian O'Rorke, to design (1934) and , which became the focus of great interest from the British design fraternity. =Second World War and after= in Pyrmont, New South Wales The Second World War again saw the requisitioning of Orient Line ships, with all eight seeing service. Unfortunately four were lost, with the other four returning to the England-Australia mail service in 1947. It took a number of years for the company's fleet to be returned to full strength due to the slow industrial recovery after the war. Three new ships of 28,000‚Äì29,000 tons entered service: , and , matching in speed and size the three new postwar ships for P&O; ( (1949), and ). All had higher speeds that allowed them to reduce the sailing time from England to Australia by eight days to 28 days and operated a coordinated service from Tilbury. However, the 1950s also saw air travel beginning to reduce shipping companies' passenger trade. Ships were increasingly switched to cruising for part of the year, and the Oronsay began a trans-Pacific service in 1954. Despite this downturn in ocean liner traffic, both P&O; and Orient Line ordered new, larger vessels ‚Äì for the former, for the latter. These were the largest and fastest ever ships for the England ‚Äì Australia route, reducing the voyage time from 28 days to 21 days with their service speed of . Although slightly smaller than Canberra, Oriana was the faster of the two and after the final takeover of Orient Line in 1966, Oriana took the P&O; Golden Cockerel for fastest ship in the fleet from Canberra. However, the two ships' career as passenger liners was short- lived, being switched to full-time cruising from 1974 onwards. =Merger= The Oriana was the last ship ordered for the Orient Line, and the last to fly the Orient Line flag. P&O; and Orient Line were formally merged in 1960 to form P&O-Orient; Lines. In 1964 the Orient Line colour scheme of corn-cream coloured hulls was discontinued in favour of P&O;'s white livery, and Orcades and Oronsay transferred to the P&O; fleet. The name Orient Line was dropped altogether in 1966 when Orsova and Oriana were also transferred to the P&O; fleet. Symbolically, the last, largest and fastest ship of the Orient Line, the Oriana, wore the Orient Line flag for her final voyage prior to retirement in March 1986. Oriana survived another 19 years after retiring and being sold, a career as a floating tourist attraction ending in 2005 with her being scrapped. P&O; has perpetuated Orianas memory with a cruise ship named launched in 1995. The Orient Line brand was sold to Gerry Herrod so he could start Orient Lines.

Peter Denny (1917-2009) Peter Denny (1821-1895) (Daniel Macnee, 1868) Peter Denny FRSE LLD (25 October 1821 ‚Äì 22 August 1895) was a shipbuilder and shipowner based in Dumbarton, Scotland. Parents and Education Denny was the son of William Denny (1779-1833) and his wife Christeanne Macintyre. He was first apprenticed to a local lawyer and then to the Dumbarton glassworks. Aged 21 he returned to shipbuilding, which was the established family occupation, and worked as a bookkeeper for Robert Napier and Sons. Career In 1844 Peter became a junior partner alongside his brothers in Denny Brothers. He was responsible for managing the offices in that business. In 1849 the company was dissolved and reformed as William Denny and Brothers Limited. In partnership with John McAusland and John Tulloch, he formed a marine engineering company in 1850 (Tulloch and Denny). This complimented Denny's shipbuilding operations. William Denny died in June 1854 leaving Peter as the main partner in Dennys, while his other brother James retired in 1862. Tulloch also retired in 1862 and the engineering company was renamed Denny & Company. The Peter Denny built 1865 by Duthie of Aberdeen belonged to the Albion company. She operated on the route to New Zealand including carrying emigrants. Denny appreciated that to succeed as a shipbuilder it was necessary to obtain orders and therefore involved himself in the shipping world. As a member of the Free Church of Scotland he contributed towards the Free Church settlement in New Zealand and came in contact with Paddy Henderson & Co. He became a partner in their shipping interests, resulting in orders for Denny's for new ships. In 1859 Denny's expanded into the North Yard and the engine works was enlarged. In 1864 some ground was obtained on the eastern side of the river opposite the original shipyard which remained the property of William Denny's estate. The western yard was surrendered and all operations transferred to the new Leven shipyard by 1867. In 1871 Peter served on the parliamentary committee on the design of warships and in 1876 on the Royal Commission into loss of life and property at sea. Denny's engaged in a profitable business constructing blockade runner ships during the American civil war and purchased large shareholdings in the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company and Albion shipping company. This led to further orders for ships specially designed to operate in the shallow Irrawady River in Burma. William Denny (1847-1887) (Norman MacBeth, 1888) Peter's eldest son William Denny FRSE (1847-1887) became a partner in the company in 1868 and eventually took over management. He was particularly interested in hull design and was responsible for the construction of the companies testing tanks in 1881 for trialling models of hull designs before construction. Peter now took more interest in diversifying his interests, including becoming a director of Paddy Henderson, British & Burmese Steam Navigation Company, Albion shipping and Rio Tinto Mines. He sought out orders from foreign governments including Spain, Portugal and Belgium and took a financial interest in encouraging local industry. He donated large amounts of money to local hospital charities and to establish educational scholarships. In 1890 he was awarded an honorary doctorate (LLD) by Glasgow university to recognise his charitable works for education. In 1876 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), Anderson Kirkwood, Allan Thomson and David Stevenson.https://www.rse.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf On 17 March 1886 William Denny committed suicide in Buenos Aires following disastrous investments in La Platense Flotilla company in 1882. Following his son's death, Peter retired further from his business interests, dying at the family home Helenslee in Dumbarton on 22 August 1895. He left an estate of ¬£200,000 though his lifetime earnings were in the region of ¬£1.5 million (approximately multiply by 100 for 2012 values). Family Peter married Helen Leslie on 26 January 1846. They had eight sons including Sir Archibald Denny. Helen died on 5 March 1905.  Tributes  Peter Denny is the eponymist of the annual Denny Medal by IMarEST.

(\\"the Second Uniform Tax case\\") is a High Court of Australia case that affirmed the Commonwealth government's ability to impose a scheme of uniform income tax, adding to Australia's vertical fiscal imbalance in the spending requirements and taxing abilities of the various levels of government. Overview The Uniform Tax system was implemented in 1942 and relied upon 4 pieces of legislation, all held to be constitutionally valid in the First Uniform Tax case.. Some of the laws were justified under the defence power, but the scheme was not dismantled after the end of wartime conflict. It was held that the Income Tax Act 1942,. could not be challenged because it was within the Commonwealth's taxation power. The Income Tax (Wartime Arrangements) Act 1942,. was not an issue because it had already been repealed. In the first Uniform Tax case the High Court decided that the Commonwealth Parliament had the power to tax incomes. The Commonwealth had passed legislation that allowed them to nationally tax incomes. Prior to this each state had their own income tax laws. The new Commonwealth taxation was so high that people could not effectively pay both taxes. The states challenged this in the High Court and argued that; Taxation was a concurrent power; the Commonwealth tax was so high that people would not be able to pay both taxes and therefore the states would no longer be able to tax incomes. The High Court disagreed and held that section 109 ensured that Commonwealth law overrode inconsistent state laws on concurrent powers, the Commonwealth could impose income Taxation. Decision The High Court affirmed the position of the First Uniform Tax case, with some exceptions. The States Grants Act 1942,. was held to be valid, despite a section 96 issue. The Commonwealth can use the section 96 grants power to induce a state to exercise its own powers as well as abstain from using its powers. Hence the Commonwealth can do such things to encourage or discourage a state from exercising its powers. However, while it can induce such things, it cannot coerce a state into accepting a grant. Nonetheless, indirect compulsion is constitutional. While the Income Tax Act 1942 raised Commonwealth income tax rates to a level that made it politically impossible for the states to impose their own, this was not at the level of coercion that was prohibited. The decision in the First Uniform Tax case was overruled in relation to section 221 of the Income Assessment Act 1942. Section 221 required taxpayers to meet their Commonwealth tax liabilities before state tax liabilities and this section was held to be invalid. The majority (Dixon CJ, McTiernan, Kitto and Taylor JJ) thought that it was not pursuant to the taxation power. Dixon CJ held that it could only possibly be a valid exercise of the implied incidental taxation power. However, the scope of section 51(ii) is federal taxation for federal purposes. Hence any taxation law made pursuant to the incidental power must also be federal taxation for federal purposes. Dixon CJ saw the purpose of the legislation as the exclusion of the state's ability to impose income tax, which is not a federal purpose. Although this section was challenged and overturned, it was not important because in a practical sense the states could no longer impose income taxes. The Commonwealth cannot restrain states in terms of their governmental functions. Dixon CJ inferred from this principles that there should be some restraints on interpretation of section 96 of the constitution. Section 96 grants must be confined to grants of money, and is not a power to make laws with respect to general subject matter. It must be concerned with state finance and must not be coercive. The power to attach conditions to section 96 grants is broad but they must be within the state's constitutional competence to fulfil.

At the 2016 census, Bruthen had a population of 814. Bruthen is east of Bairnsdale and east of the state capital Melbourne. History All that remains of the RAAF jet that crashed at Bruthen in 1958 Bruthen is an Aboriginal word from the Brabiralong people of the Gunai/Kurnai tribe meaning ‚Äòlong wooden point‚Äô. Alfred Howitt claimed the proper name for the area around Bruthen was Murloo, meaning ‚Äòpipeclay‚Äô. Notorious mass murderer of Gunnaikurnai people, Angus McMillan, first passed through the area of what is now Bruthen on 14 April 1840 on his early murderous forays from the Omeo region. The Post Office opened on 15 January 1862 and the first school opened in 1872. On 27 November 1958 an RAAF Avon-Sabre Fighter Jet crashed on the outskirts of Bruthen, narrowly missing the populated area of town. Flight Lieutenant Ralph Oborn was flying from New South Wales to the RAAF base in Sale when his engine ‚Äòflamed out‚Äô. Oborn ejected at 500 ft, suffering only minor injuries, and became the first person to safely eject from an aeroplane in Australia. The Bruthen Court of Petty Sessions closed in 1969. Facilities Bruthen has a small shopping centre, including a general store (established in 1860 and it continues to be run out of a period building), bakery, Post Office, hotel, service station, as well as speciality stores and cafes. One of the new local features is the Bullant Brewery which offers meals and a variety of locally brewed Victorian beers. Bruthen also has a Police station, State Emergency Service and Country Fire Authority (CFA) branches, an Anglican church, a cemetery and a primary school. A railway line used to pass through town, with the railway station just to the east of the township; the station site remains as does a former railway tunnel under the main road and a railway bridge, the Storer Bridge, over the Tambo River, these facilities remaining in use as part of the shared use East Gippsland rail trail. Activities The Bruthen community holds a number of activities throughout the year. These include the \\"Mixed Bag\\" art exhibition, the Bruthen Village Markets (every 4th Saturday of the month), annual Parish dance, and the Bruthen Blues & Arts Festival on the 3rd weekend of February each year. The East Gippsland rail trail, which runs from Bairnsdale to Orbost, passes through Bruthen, providing an excellent facility for cycling, walking and horse-riding. In November 2012, 3,500 cyclists spent their first night in Bruthen as part of the nine-day Great Victorian Bike Ride from Lakes Entrance to Phillip Island.

The film follows the downward spiral of society during a widespread and lengthy power outage in Southern California. As Koepp's directorial debut, the film was inspired by the 1978 documentary television series Connections and the 1960 The Twilight Zone episode \\"The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street\\", where Koepp's uncle, actor Claude Akins, starred. The Trigger Effect explores the idea that a simple power outage can potentially trigger a chain of largely unfavorable events, implying that modern society cannot live peacefully together without technology. Most of the film was shot in Los Angeles, where Koepp was based at the time. The film performed poorly at the box office and drew mixed reviews from critics, some of whom highlighted its surreal and enveloping style as well as the performances of the lead actors. Criticism was targeted at its safe and predictable ending. A novel based on the film and written by Dewey Gram was released in September 1996 by Berkley Books. Plot Annie and Matthew, a young married couple, find their infant daughter screaming with a high temperature and an earache. Matthew calls the doctor, who promises to phone in a prescription to the pharmacist the following day. During the night, the neighborhood wakes up due to a massive power outage. When Matthew visits the pharmacist the next day, he is unable to get the required medicine due to the blackout. Matthew steals the medicine when the pharmacist is not looking. Social unrest ensues due to the persistent blackout, leading Matthew and his wife's best friend, Joe, to buy a shotgun. When an intruder breaks into the couple's house the following night, Matthew and Joe chase him outside, where a neighbor shoots the intruder. The neighbors conspire to cover up the fact that the deceased intruder was not armed. As the blackout continues for days over a large area, more chaos occurs. As a result, the group decides to flee to Annie's parents' house, 530 miles away. They do not have enough fuel to travel the whole way, so they stop by an abandoned car hoping to siphon some. A man, Gary, is lying in the backseat. After Joe notices that Gary has a handgun, he heads back to their vehicle to get his own shotgun. Joe aims the shotgun at Gary to scare him off, but he shoots Joe and steals their vehicle. Matthew walks an hour to a farmhouse to try to get help for his family. The occupant, Raymond, refuses to help him initially, as he does not trust him. Matthew collects the shotgun and returns to the house, hoping to steal the car. He breaks in to get the car keys, and a standoff ensues between Raymond and him. When Raymond's young daughter enters the room, Matthew returns to civility, lowering his weapon. Raymond agrees to help Matthew, and soon afterwards Joe is loaded into an ambulance. Society returns to normal once the power returns, though Annie, Matthew and their neighbors are somewhat different from their experience.

Koepp noted the similarities between them, stating that \\"When technological advances go out, the veneer of civilization is removed also, and they're capable of inappropriate behavior.\\" It took him 12 drafts to fine-tune the script. The film was produced by Amblin Entertainment for US$8 million, a cost that was considered high for an independent film and low for a studio film. According to Koepp, getting the necessary amount of money to make the film was challenging and involved a lot of talking and pleading. Principal photography took place from July 31 to September 22, 1995. Most of the film was shot in Los Angeles, California, where Koepp was based at the time. The nuclear power plant that can be seen in the distant landscape when the protagonists are on a highway near the end of the film is the Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station. As his directorial debut, The Trigger Effect was a new experience for Koepp, who remarked: \\"There's less , coming from one brain. Making all those decisions by yourself can be a drag, you end up having long shouting matches with yourself.\\" Actor Kyle MacLachlan, who played Matthew, originally wanted to play Joe because he wanted to avoid a \\"juvenile lead\\", a role with which he strongly identified. Nevertheless, he liked the script from the beginning and felt that playing a \\"real guy\\" with real emotions was \\"fun\\" for him, especially after playing unconventional roles in Twin Peaks and Showgirls. Themes The Trigger Effect invokes the idea that one simple event can potentially lead to social, racial and sexual issues, implying that humans cannot live peacefully together. The film opens with a scene where two coyotes follow their animal instincts and eat fresh meat, as if humans were not animals themselves. MacLachlan said that the film shows \\"how quickly humanity would fall back into almost a tribal existence\\" after a simple power outage, while actor Dermot Mulroney noted that the film addresses inexplicable yet realistic behaviors between characters, such as mistrust between black and white people, and issues regarding levels of education or personal achievement. Similarly, SplicedWire editor Rob Blackwelder interpreted it as \\"a commentary on the underlying sense of danger and lack of trust that permeates American society.\\" Resentment is another theme that is explored, as reflected in the scene where Matthew tells Joe it is more natural for him to buy a shotgun. The character played by actress Elisabeth Shue, Annie, switches feelings for Matthew on and off. This, according to Shue, shows that a married woman with a comfortable life has as many desires, needs and pain, as a homeless person. Release The Trigger Effect premiered at the Seattle International Film Festival on May 16, 1996. It then had a wide release on August 30, 1996 in 524 theaters, finishing 12th and grossing $1.9 million at the U.S. box office weekend. The film's poor performance was compared to that of the comedy The Stupids, which opened in the same weekend. Overall, the film went on to make $3.6 million in North America. A novelization, authored by Dewey Gram, was released in September 1996 by Berkley Books. The Trigger Effect was released on VHS in January 1997 and on DVD in July 1999. =Critical reception= Upon release, The Trigger Effect received mixed reviews from critics. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, film critic Lisa Schwarzbaum described The Trigger Effect as \\"a sturdy and efficient thriller\\", while Marc Savlov, writing for The Austin Chronicle, highlighted Koepp's ability to gradually increase the tension as the film progresses. The cast was generally praised, particularly Shue, who Schwarzbaum singled out for retaining some of her \\"effective Leaving Las Vegas disoriented languidness.\\" Even so, film critic Richard von Busack felt that the film's characters \\"never really engage the viewer\\" despite their proficient performances. The ending was criticized for being safe and predictable, especially when compared to the riskier narrative prior to it. In his review for New York magazine, David Denby praised the first half of the film, stating that Koepp shows both a Hitchcockian style, where tension is built through silences of routine domestic scenes, and elements of his collaboration with Spielberg. According to Denby, \\"the slightly bluish light scheme (the glam-fluorescent) and the images of suburban peace are reminiscent of Spielberg's mood of surreal wonder. This suburb, however, is just barely holding on to civilization.\\" Nevertheless, he felt that the second half of the film \\"shifts into a predictable suburban-love-triangle potboiler\\" and that the ending was \\"as abrupt and thin as a TV show.\\" Some journalists criticized the film for the vagueness of its writing. In his review for Metro, von Busack explained that, although the film offers some hints about Annie's past, the character is not fully developed, and felt that Matthew's relationship with Joe is not very clear. Richard Harrington, writing for The Washington Post, criticized the fact that the film does not explain what caused the power outage and that the characters seem unimpressed about it. This vagueness was highlighted by Variety editor Ken Eisner, who acknowledged that Koepp's \\"cool lensing, tight cutting and minimal use of music support this conceptual, if head-scratching approach\\", describing The Trigger Effect as \\"a bleak, highly stylized view of modern civilization.\\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times agreed, stating that the film's enveloping style \\"is haunting in its own powerful way.\\" References External links * Category:1996 films Category:1990s thriller films Category:Amblin Entertainment films Category:American films Category:American thriller films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by David Koepp Category:Films scored by James Newton Howard Category:Films set in California Category:Films shot in California Category:Gramercy Pictures films Category:Films with screenplays by David Koepp Category:1996 directorial debut films ","title":"The Trigger Effect"},{"id":"5664891","text":"Mart√≠n Sastre (born February 13, 1976 in Montevideo, Uruguay) is a film director and contemporary media artist working with film, video, sculpture, photography and drawing.

This same year his work Bolivia 3: Confederation Next, where a cartoon version of Sastre fights U.S. Artist Matthew Barney, was selected for the National representation of Uruguay in the S√£o Paulo Biennial. In 2005 his short film Diana: The Rose Conspiracy was released during the Venice Biennial where the artist claims to have found Diana, Princess of Wales alive in Montevideo.

The IFC was Scottish-owned, and was managed by P Henderson & Company from Glasgow. The IFC operated from 1865 until the late 1940s. At its peak in the late 1920s, the IFC fleet was the largest fleet of river boats in the world, consisting of over 600 vessels carrying some 8-9 million passengers and 1¬º million tons of cargo a year.Irrawaddy Flotilla Company Beginnings Seal of Myanma Inland Water Transport The IFC was formed in 1865 as the Irrawaddy Flotilla and Burmese Steam Navigation Co Ltd, primarily to ferry troops up and down the Irrawaddy River and delta. Soon, the company was carrying passengers, rice, government stores, and mail from Rangoon to Prome, Thayetmyo and Mandalay, and then extended in 1868 to Bhamo. In 1875, the company's name was shortened to the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company. Although registered in Glasgow, the operational headquarters were in Rangoon, with a major shipyard across the river at Dalla. The company's services became indispensable to the oil fields up river at Yenangyaung and Chauk for carrying supplies and heavy equipment. Partly because the railway to Mandalay followed the path of the Sittaung River rather than the Irrawaddy River, the company stayed relevant and useful well into the twentieth century, even after independence from Britain. Former Irrawaddy Flotilla Company building in Yangon, which now houses the Inland Water Transport The ships, most of which were paddle steamers, were generally built in Scotland before being dismantled and transported to Burma for reassembly. When the Japanese invaded Burma in World War II, the Manager of the IFC's Burma fleet, John Morton, ordered the scuttling of all 600 ships in his fleet. This prevented the Japanese from having a usable, local fleet for transport up the Irrawaddy River. In 1948 the company was reconstituted as the Government Inland Water Transport Board. Quote The paddle steamers of the IFC inspired the famous lines penned by Rudyard Kipling: ::By the old Moulmein Pagoda, lookin' lazy at the sea, ::There's a Burma girl a-settin', and I know she thinks o' me; ::For the wind is in the palm-trees, and the temple-bells they say: ::\\"Come you back, you British soldier; come you back to Mandalay!\\" ::::Come you back to Mandalay, ::::Where the old Flotilla lay: ::::Can't you 'ear their paddles chunkin' from Rangoon to Mandalay? ::::On the road to Mandalay, ::::Where the flyin'-fishes play, ::::An' the dawn comes up like thunder outer China 'crost the Bay!http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Mandalay References External links *Photograph of the Beeloo, a mail steamer of the IFC.

He made paintings for Liberty magazine covers, calendars, prints, pin-ups and advertisements for major companies such as Shell Oil, Tums, Dr. Pepper, U.S. Rubber... Looking at St. Louis city directories from the 30's, we find that McCoy is associated with several studios:http://www.mandrakewiki.org/index.php?title=Wilson_McCoy 1930: McCoy & Quest (2313 Washington Avenue), with Charles Francis Quest. 1933: Windsor Studio (2670 Washington Blvd), with William E Heede, Martin C Kaiser, Robert McRoy, Everett Hayden Parks, Elise B Parks, Lester Harry \\"Tex\\" Willman and Co Windsor. 1936: Associated Artists of St Louis (2670 Washington Blvd), with William H Cramer, Ralph Wesley Guze, William E Heede, Martin C Kaiser, Marjorie M Lippman, Everett Hayden Parks, Elise B Parks, Lester Harry \\"Tex\\" Willman, John Hamilton Stevens and Fred Adolph Toerper. 1937: Advertiser‚Äôs Artists Co.

The Phantom Wilson McCoy developed a unique, \\"Naive art\\" graphical style of drawing. He always drew with attention to details, and he used photographic references for every drawing, having his family and friends pose for him and act out the different situations happening in the stories he worked on. When his friend Ray Moore served in the military during WWII, McCoy took over the responsibilities of illustrating The Phantom. His wife Dorothy, also an artist, served as a penciller of the lettering and panels in Wilson's comic strips.A short autobio on fan site In an interview with Ed Rhoades, Bob McCoy confided : \\"Initially, Wilson McCoy was paid $75 a week to sub for Moore, an arrangement that ticked him off\\" when he discovered how much more Moore was getting paid. But conditions improved, and the family moved to a prosperous Chicago suburb. Wilson McCoy built a studio. Robert regained a bedroom.\\" Speaking of cartooning Wilson McCoy said to the newspaper San Antonio Light (Sunday March 27, 1960) \\"King Features Syndicate which distributes The Phantom prefers the artists keep 6 weeks ahead of their weekly strips and three months ahead for Sunday material. He added : But few artists ever reach this goal especially if they are not also the author, Lee Falk writes the story of The Phantom as well as the story for Mandrake the Magician, girls at King features Syndicate do the coloring for the Sunday comics.\\" Wilson McCoy started signing the strips and was fully credited as the artist from the daily story \\"Queen Astra Of Trondelay\\" (1946). Certain art critics have termed Wilson McCoy's artistic style as Naive Art. Lee Falk was already known for the use of surrealism in Mandrake stories. McCoy incorporated certain metaphysical and surrealistic artistic elements to illustrate Phantom stories. He masterfully set the atmosphere, using \\"film noir\\" lighting, whenever required by the storyline. Aspects of American Realism may also be perceived due to the use of photographic references in his panels. In a Phantom exhibition held in Sweden, a parallel was drawn between Wilson McCoy and Edward Hopper (1882-1967). Hopper had also worked as a commercial advertising illustrator (ref. artwork for \\"American Locomotive Co\\".https://linusfontrodona.com/2017/08/23/an-illustration-for-american- locomotive-by-e-hopper-1944/ 1944). Both worked in the realm of narrative art and were masters of dramatic lighting (& diagonal shadows). McCoy ceased drawing the strip after he became ill in 1961. His last daily strip was dated 19th August 1961 and his last Sunday strip was dated 17th September 1961 and the following Sunday strip, dated 24th September 1961, was drawn by Carmine Infantinohttps://www.chroniclechamber.com/post/2018/09/24/the-limper- identifying-carmine-infantinos-input-to-the-phantom The strip was continued by Bill Lignante for a short while, and then by Sy Barry.Lambiek Comiclopedia In 2016 a Wilson McCoy 1958 Phantom sunday art page was auctioned by Sotheby's Auction House - one of the world's biggest art auctioneers in its European \\"Bande Dessin√©e\\" Auction. According to the late comics historian and collector Ethan Roberts, \\"McCoy was an adherent of a different school, the school of the poster artist...line work is typically thicker, more definitive, bolder than found in the illustrator's school. The overall composition is simplified to have an immediate eye-catching impact on the viewer... Depth of field is significantly reduced or lost all together, but understanding exactly whats going on is enhanced. Its easier and faster to comprehend the action from a greater distance. Less attention and concentration is required allowing the reader to move through the story more quickly, an advantage for the busy newspaper reader.\\"Hermes Press The Phantom complete newspaper dailies Vol 8 The Sunday page artworks are characterized by the ligne claire style of drawing similar to that of Herg√©'s Tintin. The original inked line art has well defined contours and carry very little or no hatchings and shading (Zip- a-tones were not used on Sunday art either) thus allowing the colorist full flexibility to use bright, bold colors.  Wilson McCoy The World Traveller  Like Phantom creator Lee Falk, McCoy was a world traveler with an adventurous spirit, traveling to jungles, where he visited native tribes. McCoy travelled to the French Congo in 1961 on a sketching safari researching the Mbuti pygmies of the Ituri rainforest tribe for episodes of The Phantom. The Mbuti became inspiration for the Bandar tribe featured in the phantom stories. He stopped drawing became ill and was hospitalised in 1961. According to Sy Barry, \\"First of all when Wilson McCoy became ill and went into the hospital, he was too ill. He had some kind of infection that reoccurs, that he developed when he was in Africa and it seemed to return. Somehow it formed a blood clot and went to his heart and he died in the hospital.\\"https://www.chroniclechamber.com/single-post/2017/01/27/An- Interview-with-Sy-Barry In another interview published by Hermes Press in 2019, Sy Barry recalls \\"... he seemed to have an infection, a lingering dormant infection that he picked up in Africa and they had gone and treated him with antibiotics but every once in a while it would crop up a bit and affect his heart a bit little too. This time he had a heart seizure in the hospital after having been battling the disease and meanwhile they had called me in...\\" McCoy died after a heart attack in Barrington in 1961.  Letters to fans  McCoy actively interacted with his fans through letters. He set up a Phantom club in the 50's and sent out a sealed Certificate of membership to fans with the following mention : \\"Know All Men By These Presents : That in consideration of your valued friendship this certificate of membership in the Ancient and Mysterious Order of The Phantom is hereby awarded to ....., this day of.... with all rights and privileges, to Health, Wealth and Wisdom.\\" signed by himself (Exalted Imperial Phantom Delieanator) & Dorothy (Witnessing and Recording Fatima)\\" In a letter to a fan written in 1949 McCoy explained that \\" I have never had the syndicate return any of my originals to me, however, will make a sketch for your collection and mail with this letter...\\" '' In another letter to Joyce and Ken Browne signed ‚ÄúDot, Carol, Bob, Wilson, and Brownie,‚Äù one page, 8.5 x 11, February 21, 1950. McCoy wrote : \\"About a year and a half ago, my wife, daughter, and I had dinner in Bangor on our way thru to Harborside where we spent about a week, and where I did some landscape painting. Main[e] is certainly a beautiful state. By the way, I should appreciate it if you would tear out the full sheet of the paper in which the Phantom appears and mail it to me, so that I may see the size and position. Best wishes also from the 'McCoy' family.\\" In the upper portion of the page McCoy has added a brilliant ink sketch of the Phantom in front of his secret abode, the Skull cave, with McCoy adding his artist signature below, \\"Wilson McCoy, 2/21/50,\\" and writing an inscription in a speech bubble above: \\"Best wishes to Joyce and Ken Browne, from the Phantom family‚ÄîDiana‚ÄìMama‚ÄìUncle Dave‚ÄìDevil‚ÄìHero‚ÄìGuran‚Äìand the Phantom.\\" In a letter to Clarence Allenhttps://www.okhistory.org/historycenter/cartoonists/allen.html in April 3 1953, McCoy wrote : \\"Congratulations on doing a bang up job with your new book. It is good that you have both the pro and con, contained in the same volume, since each is so convincing that if either were seen alone a reader would be inclined to believe it without dreaming that there could be another side of the story. Thanks for my copy. Sincerely, Wilson McCoy.\\" In 1954, sophomore students from the history section of Federal Way High School took issue with a panel in a Phantom comic strip which contained a depiction of Alexander the Great with white beard. McCoy wrote a letter of reply and said \\"You have got me backed into a corner and by superior numbers have brought me to my knees. Whenever i get into an untenable situation i call upon one of my very good friends to extricate me. Have turned your letter over to this friend for the answer.\\" - this friend was none other than the Phantom who sent the following message via tom tom drums in a drawing : \\"Phantom to Federal Way, McCoy is correct Alex received a scare while still a baby turning his hair (and beard) white. Best regards to all, The Phantom.\\" Today, his letters are considered collector items and sold at auctions.  Wilson McCoy's Phantom in the world of Contemporary Art  Wilson McCoy inspired several artists to create works of art based on panels from his Phantom comic strips. Renowned artists such as Jan H√•fstr√∂m, Dick Frizzell, and Peter Kingston have repeatedly reinterpreted panels from McCoy's art for their own creations. Works of art inspired by Wilson McCoy's Phantom & Mr Walker : Dick Frizzell (New Zealand) : The Big Kiss, Another Big Kiss, Sleeping Woman, Who Will Save Her? (Phantom Triptych) oil on three canvas panels 2001, A Flying Oaf(gouach on paper 2002)... Peter Kingston (Australia) : Running Mr. Walker... Jan H√•fstr√∂m (Sweden) : Who is Mr Walker?

On 24th Sept 2012 a Wilson McCoy inspired - Jan H√•fstr√∂m \\"Mr Walker\\" contemporary art postal stamp was released in Faroe Islands. The idea came from Niels Halm, director of the Nordic House in T√≥rshavn. Dare Jennings, founder of the brands: Deus Ex Machina and Mambo Graphics cited Wilson McCoy as his favorite artist in his opening speechhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a15OI8vgJZM at the Bunker Cartoon Gallery Phantom Art show in New South Wales, Australia. Mr. Jennings also produced Wilson McCoy Phantom design t-shirts via the Phantom textile printers (Chippendale, Australia) in the early 1980s.  Reprints  McCoy's Phantom stories are occasionally published in the Australian Frew Publications Phantom comic, and the Swedish, Norwegian and Finnish Phantom comic books, and also in hardcover editions. In 1955, Phantom Artist Wilson R. McCoy was one of 95 comic artist's invited to attend US President's breakfast hosted by the 'National Cartoonists Society' in Washington. President Eisenhower, USA President from 1953-1961, attended the breakfast organised as a fundraiser for the 'US Savings Bond program'. Wilson McCoy's art was featured in \\"President Eisenhower's Cartoon Book\\" published in 1956 which was a tribute to the President. In 1975 the publishing company Biblioteca Unviversale Rizzoli of Milan released a Wilson McCoy special in the series I Giganti del Fumetto with a 5 page foreword entitled \\"Un fantasma che cammina da quarant anni\\" (\\"A Ghost who walks since 40 years\\") written by Ferruccio Alessandrihttp://www.phantomwiki.org/I_Giganti_del_Fumetto_6 In the year 2000, Egmont publications from Sweden published a special edition called \\"Wilson McCoy - de opublicerade √§ventyren\\". It includes articles about McCoy, written by Ulf Granberg, Ed Rhoades and Pete Klaus, and also features an interview of McCoy's children Carol Dharamsey and Robert McCoy by Ed Rhoades.http://www.phantomwiki.org/Wilson_McCoy_- _de_opublicerade_%C3%A4ventyren In 2005 the Italian publisher La Repubblica published a Wilson McCoy anthology called \\"L'Uomo mascherato ‚Äì Il mito dell'Ombra che cammina\\"(Serie Oro 18) with an introductory essay by Luca Raffaellihttp://www.phantomwiki.org/L%27uomo_mascherato_%E2%80%93_Il_mito_dell%27Ombra_che_cammina American publisher Hermes Press published the Wilson McCoy daily continuities in their The Phantom Complete Dailies volumes 5-17 (2013 - 2019).

Born in Brooklyn, New York, Lignante was in the Navy and studied art at Pratt Institute. He first drew The Phantom when he completed a strip left unfinished after the death of Wilson McCoy in 1961. He then drew the Sunday strip from August, 1961 to May 1962. He did The Phantom comic book (interior art) for Gold Key Comics, from issue 1-18; continuing the book for King Comics, through issue 28 and he also contributed to Charlton Comics, when they published Phantom issues 30-74 (although Jim Aparo did most art, as Lignante was in courtrooms by then). He had a 16-year career as an animator (layout artist) for Hanna-Barbera.

No roughs, research, conferences, assistants, editors and no time.

She was launched on 29 April 1933 and served in the Mediterranean after her completion. From 1 September 1934 until February 1935 she made a cruise to Australia and New Zealand. During the Spanish Civil War she served in the western Mediterranean and was based at Palina and Melilla. In July 1940, she was present at the Battle of Calabria, also called the battle of Punta Stilo. In October she took part in a mission to Albania, and in December she came under direct orders of Supermarina (Naval Headquarters) for special duties in connection with the protection of traffic to Albania from January 1941. However, the following month an important supply convoy to Tripoli required her use for cover, in company with the light cruiser and some destroyers. In the course of this operation the ship was torpedoed and sunk by the British submarine off the island of Kerkennah in the early hours of 25 February. It took the Italian cruiser only six minutes to sink after her magazine detonated, with the loss of 484 men.

He was Member of Parliament for Clapham from 1970 to February 1974, then for Streatham from February 1974 until he lost the seat to Labour Party candidate Keith Hill in 1992. Business and personal life Shelton was born in Plymouth, the son of Lt Col Richard Shelton of Guernsey, and attended Radley College in Radley, Berkshire. He was evacuated in 1940, studying at Tabor Academy in Marion, Massachusetts, on an English-Speaking Union scholarship, and then Worcester College, Oxford, where he read Philosophy, Politics and Economics. Then he lectured on economics for a year at the University of Texas at Austin, before moving into business and advertising, which included work in South America. Shelton married Anne Warder in 1960, and was knighted in 1989. Shelton developed Alzheimer's disease in the 1990s, and it eventually caused his death. He also lost heavily in the financial crisis at Lloyd's of London and the 1990s property slump. Furthermore, accusations of financial irregularity led to the closure in 1995 of Access to Justice, a company that he had set up to provide free legal advice to people on low incomes. Consequently, he was given a five-year ban from serving as a company director. Political career Shelton entered politics upon his return to London in 1964, becoming that year the president of the Wandsworth Young Conservatives. He was elected to the Greater London Council to represent Wandsworth in 1967, and in 1968 he became the Chief Whip of the Conservative majority on the Inner London Education Authority. Shelton's association with Margaret Thatcher began when she became Shadow Secretary of State for Education and Science in 1967. He soon showed his independence of mind, refusing to participate in the racism directed towards his Labour opponent in the 1970 election, and becoming an early monetarist, a supporter of the European Economic Community as a trade bloc, and an advocate of parental choice in schooling. He was also a traditionalist on moral issues, a Zionist, and concerned with Greek and Polish interests. He served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Sir John Eden, Minister of State for Posts and Telecommunications from 1972 to 1974. Shelton was one of the first people to advocate for Thatcher to succeed Edward Heath as Conservative leader, becoming second-in-command to campaign manager Airey Neave. Shelton is reputed to have organised the successful \\"stealth\\" campaign to convince backbench Conservatives on the party's right wing that by backing Thatcher in the leadership ballot they could oust Heath.Choosing the Lady, Another Look at the 1975 Leadership Contest Conservative History Journal, issue 1 Summer 2003, Matthew Bailey and Philip Cowley After Thatcher's victory in the leadership election, Shelton became her Parliamentary Private Secretary, but resigned the following year, preferring the freedom of the backbenches. He continued his interest in education, repeatedly being elected Vice-Chairman of the backbench Conservative Education Committee, and serving as a junior minister in the Department of Education and Science from 1981 to 1983, in which role he increased computer provision in primary schools and proposed a new vocational qualification of secondary education. Shelton became an increasingly vocal critic of local government. He clashed with the left-wing leadership of his local Lambeth Council and promoted a bill in 1981 to restrain local-government spending. However, he opposed Thatcher's flagship Community Charge ('poll tax'), because it was designed to give local authorities more independence. Shelton was known as a Thatcherite, serving on Thatcher's campaign team in the leadership election of 1989 and opposing her resignation in 1990. He was confident of retaining his seat in 1992, but, having been defeated, he received 5000 letters of thanks, mostly from people who had voted Labour.

It is on a small peninsula south-east of Bairnsdale, separating Lake King and Bancroft Bay on the Gippsland Lakes. Metung Post Office opened on 2 June 1879. Metung is a popular holiday spot, near to larger towns but off any main routes itself. Many of the permanent inhabitants commute to work at Bairnsdale or Lakes Entrance. Golfers play at the course of the Kings Cove Metung Golf Club on Kings Cove Boulevard. Legend Rock The original inhabitants of the area--the Aboriginal Gunai or Kurnai people--tell a story about an unusual group of rocks now found alongside the boardwalk in the Metung Marina on Bancroft Bay. This legend or fable indicates how greed will be punished. The legend goes that some fishermen made a good catch and ate the fish around their campfire. The fishermen, however, did not share their catch with their dogs, despite having more than enough to eat. As a punishment, the women, who were guardians of social law, turned the greedy men to stone. Originally there were three rocks found at this location that related to the legend, but two of them were destroyed during road works. The remaining Legend Rock is now protected.

P Henderson & Company, also known as Paddy Henderson, was a ship owning and management company based in Glasgow, Scotland and operating to Burma. Patrick Henderson started business in Glasgow as a merchant at the age of 25 in 1834. He had three brothers. Two were merchants working for an agent in the Italian port of Leghorn; the third, George, was a sea captain with his own ship. The brothers together invested in their first ship, the Peter Senn, and the business grew from there. Patrick died in 1841, and the business was taken over by his brother, Captain George Henderson. In 1848, George took into partnership a young man of outstanding ability, James Galbraith, who expanded the business from merchants, to ship owners and ship managers. The Company started trading to New Zealand in 1854 with sailing ships carrying Scottish emigrants, and the Royal Mail. Albion Shipping Company In 1860, there being little cargo from New Zealand to Scotland, P Henderson & Co started to call at Burma with a regular service. This trade grew so quickly that in order to raise further capital, several new partners came in to form the Albion Shipping Company Ltd as ship owners. The vessels were managed by P. Henderson & Co. The Albion Shipping Company became the dominant British company in the New Zealand trade, and holders of the mail contract. In 1869 the Suez Canal was opened, making steamships more economic on the Glasgow ‚Äì Burma route, so in 1870 P. Henderson & Co. started a steamship service between Glasgow, Liverpool and Burma. No mail contract was available on this route as all mail went via India. In 1874 the British and Burmese Steam Navigation Company Ltd (BBSN) was formed to increase the capital and spread the risk of the Burmese side of the business as it grew from the era of sailing ships into more expensive and much larger steamships. BBSN took over the fleet of steamships on the Burma route, and appointed P Henderson and Co as managing agents. Most of the shares in the new company were taken up by P Henderson partners and their associates. Ships' Masters were encouraged to take shares. Peter Denny took about a fifth of the capital. 1882 saw P. Henderson and Co. pioneer the first frozen meat shipment from New Zealand to London. It used refrigerated sailing ships, because as yet there were no coaling stations en route, and without them a steamship would have to have such large coal bunkers that they would take up too much valuable cargo space. Shaw, Savill & Albion Line Nevertheless, steam propulsion increased trading possibilities and capital requirements that were beyond the capabilities of P. Henderson or the Albion Shipping Company to fulfil on their own, and so in 1882, the Albion Shipping Company amalgamated with Shaw, Savill and Company to form the Shaw, Savill and Albion Company Ltd. After the amalgamation, P. Henderson & Co remained as managers and loading brokers for the new company in Glasgow. British and Burmese Steam Navigation Company Ltd remained as a shipowning company along with another member of the group, the Burmah Steam Ship Company Ltd. James Galbraith, the driving force of P. Henderson & Co, died in 1884. His death marked the end of an era of private capital, of pioneering and of expansion into unknown countries and technologies. P Henderson ships lost The liner was built in 1920 for P Henderson's Glasgow ‚Äì Liverpool ‚Äì Rangoon service. In the Second World War she was requisitioned as a hospital ship, and this photo shows her as such at Scapa Flow. She was bought by the Ministry of Transport in 1946, became an emigrant ship in 1948, was renamed Captain Hobson in 1951 and scrapped in 1959 In 1905 a P Henderson steamship, the cargo ship , ran aground and was wrecked off Maulmain in Burma. Henderson's quickly replaced the ship with a new built the following year, but the new ship's career was cut short in the First World War, when she disappeared in January 1917 with the loss of all 92 persons aboard. There is no Imperial German Navy record of her sinking, but she is presumed to have been sunk off the south coast of Ireland. That year P Henderson lost one more ship to enemy action. On 8 July 1917 the U-boat torpedoed the passenger and cargo ship off the south coast of Ireland. Fortunately all but one of those aboard survived. Just after the Armistice with Germany P Henderson lost another ship: on 19 December 1918 the passenger and cargo ship was destroyed by fire in Rangoon. In the 1920s and '30s P Henderson had a number of new ships built, including a new in 1921. P Henderson suffered greater losses in the Second World War. On 24 November 1939 the Pegu ran around in the area of the Crosby Channel off Liverpool. She broke her back and was wrecked in separate bow and stern sections. On 13 July 1940 the German auxiliary cruiser Atlantis sank the passenger and cargo liner Kemmendine in the middle of the Indian Ocean by shellfire. On 9 April 1942 the passenger ship was in Trincomalee in Ceylon when aircraft from a Japanese aircraft carrier attacked her and set her afire. Her crew abandoned ship and then she was sunk by shellfire. The Sagaing was raised by the Sri Lankan Eastern Naval Command unit in March 2018.{cite news date=31 March 2018 title=SS Sagaing: WW2 shipwreck refloated by Sri Lanka navy publisher=BBC News url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-43607838 On 1 August 1942 the cargo ship collided with the Dutch liner off the coast of South Africa. Kalewa sank but Boringia survived the collision and rescued everyone aboard. P Henderson's heaviest losses were in 1943. On 2 April the sank the cargo ship by torpedo off the coast of Portugal, killing six of her crew. On 9 May sank the cargo and passenger ship by torpedo off the coast of West Africa, killing all 66 people aboard. On 17 June sank the passenger ship in the Mediterranean. Yoma had been converted into a troopship, and the sinking killed 484 people. On 24 July sank the cargo ship by torpedo off the coast of Brazil, killing two members of the crew. Elder, Dempster Lines Elder, Dempster Lines chartered P Henderson's fleet from 1947 and took over the company in 1952. Under Elder, Dempster modernisation of the P Henderson fleet continued, with new motor ships being delivered until at least 1961. In 1965 Ocean Steamship Co acquired control of the Elder, Dempster group. In 1967 after the Six-Day War Egypt closed the Suez Canal, so Ocean SS Co discontinued the Burma route and transferred Henderson's last three ships to Elder, Dempster. By 1970 all stock had been transferred to Elder, Dempster and the Henderson name vanished from the shipping trade.

It was patterned after an event for British Volunteers called The Queen's Match, a competition started by Queen Victoria and initiated by the National Rifle Association of Great Britain in 1860, in order to increase the ability of Britain's marksmen following the Crimean War.U.S. Army Regulation 600-8-22, Military Awards, Official Department of the Army Publications and Forms, dated 11 December 06, revised 15 September 11, last accessed 4 October 11 In 1884, the name was changed to the President's Match for the Military Rifle Championship of the United States. It was fired at Creedmoor, New York until 1891. In 1895, it was reintroduced at Sea Girt, New Jersey. The tradition of making a letter from the President of the United States the first prize began in 1904 when President Theodore Roosevelt, at the conclusion of the President's Match, personally wrote a letter of congratulations to the winner, Private Howard Gensch of the 1st Regiment of Infantry of the New Jersey National Guard. It cannot be ascertained as to when the President's Match was discontinued; however, it is known that it was not fired during World Wars I and II. It appears to have disappeared during the 1930s and during the Depression when lack of funds severely curtailed the holding of matches of importance. The President's Match was reinstated in 1957 at the National Matches as \\"The President's Hundred.\\" The 100 top-scoring competitors in the President's Match were singled out for special recognition in a retreat ceremony in which they passed in review before the winner and former winners of this historic match. On 27 May 1958, the NRA requested the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel's approval of a tab for presentation to each member of the \\"President's Hundred.\\" NRA's plan was to award the cloth tab together with a metal brassard during the 1958 National Matches. The cloth tab was of high level interest and approved for wear on the uniform on 3 March 1958. The first awards were made at Camp Perry, Ohio, in early September 1958. Only the U.S. Navy has authorized the wear of the metal brassard on the uniforms of enlisted sailors. However, the NRA issued the metal brassard to all military and civilian personnel for wear on the shooting jacket. In 1977, the National Board for the Promotion of Rifle Practice (NBPRP) assumed responsibility for the President's Match from the NRA. Today the CMP manages and awards the President's Hundred Tab/Brassard to the top 100 shooters in those matches. In September 2008, the Department of the Army authorized a miniature metal tab to be worn on the new Army Service Uniform. This is a scaled-down replica of the President's Hundred full-color embroidered tab. In January 2014, the Department of the Air Force, via an update to Air Force Instruction 36‚Äì2903, authorized the wear of the President's Hundred Tab on the Airman Battle Uniform (olive drab version) and the Air Force service uniform (miniature full color replica) through the authorization for Airmen to wear any military badge they have earned given it is worn within uniform regulations.AF uniform policy update: welcome back morale t-shirts, badges and limitless athletic shoes, by Staff Sgt.

His murder led to the resumption of war against Veii, and the eventual capture of Fidenae. Biography By the second half of the 5th century BC, the former Roman colony of Fidenae had revolted against Rome, and placed themselves under the protection of the wealthy Etruscan city-state of Veii. In 437, the Senate responded by sending four ambassadors, including Gaius Fulcinius, to the leaders of Fidenae. When Fulcinius and the rest arrived, they demanded that Fidenae abandon its pact with Veii, and return the colony to operating under Rome‚Äôs sphere of influence.Livy, 4:16 According to Livy, the leaders of Fidenae sent an urgent message to Lars Tolumnius, the king of Veii, asking what they should do. Lars Tolumnius, with an eye to binding Fidenae closer to Veii, ordered them to execute Gaius Fulcinius and his fellow ambassadors, which they proceeded to do. This act saw Rome declare war on Veii, and they sent an army to besiege Fidenae. To honour their sacrifice for the Republic, the Romans later erected half-sized statues of Gaius Fulcinius and his colleagues Tullus Cloelius, Spurius Antius, and Lucius Roscius on the Rostra, in the Roman Forum.Broughton, pg. 58 Cicero mentioned Gaius Fulcinius in his ninth Philippic, declaring that the reason Fulcinius was honoured was not that he died in bloodshed, but that he died for the Republic.Marcus Tullius Cicero, James E. G. Zetzel, Cicero: Ten Speeches (2009), pg. 304 According to Cicero, his statue was no longer on the Rostra by the time he wrote his speech attacking Marc Antony (43 BC).

Fresh from serving time for second-degree murder at Strangeways Prison, he is claustrophobic and agoraphobic, running his business empire from his desk at the house. He takes the boys in during the first episode. In one episode, he is briefly cured of his agoraphobia after falling over, but he still lives in fear of being \\"sucked off by the sky\\". = Elsie \\"Mam\\" Hepplewhite = *Played by: Margaret John Elsie is Fagin's mother whose husband was captured by Japan in World War II as a prisoner of war. He died as a POW in Japan during World War 2 when Fagin was a young boy. So, she shares a dislike for the Japanese with Richard, she because of her husband's death, he because of their technological advances. Her grandfather died after swallowing a silver threepence that was in his Christmas pudding, not before running down the road for one and a half miles (bearing in mind he was ninety-four!) = Dwayne Hoffman = *Played by: Steven Meo Hoffman (his first name Dwayne is rarely used) is a teenage petty criminal whose best friend is Charlie. He and Charlie are apprentices to Fagin's business.

S.S. Pointer. Slip Dock for Vessels up to 2,000 Tons. A & J Inglis, Ltd, was a shipbuilding firm founded by Anthony Inglis and his brother John, engineers and shipbuilders in Glasgow, Scotland in 1862. The firm built over 500 ships in a period of just over 100 years. Their Pointhouse Shipyard was at the confluence of the rivers Clyde and Kelvin. They constructed a wide range of ships, including Clyde steamers, paddle steamers and small ocean liners. In wartime, they built small warships, and in the period after World War II, they built a number of whalers. History HMS Aristocrat being converted to Talisman.

A & J Inglis of Glasgow, was formed in 1848 as an engineering works. Thomas B. Seath founded the shipyard at Pointhouse in 1845 and it was acquired by A & J Inglis in 1862. In 1884 Anthony Inglis died and his son John Inglis took over. John Inglis himself, was well known for many maritime activities. In 1885 they launched 11 ships with a total tonnage of 7,470 tons. In 1867, a Patent Slip Dock for ship repairs was built at Pointhouse. This was an innovative alternative to a dry dock, invented by Robert Napier. The vessel sat on a big trolley, which was on rails, and was hauled up onto dry land by a powerful winch. The yard had up to 2,000 employees on just 18 acres of ground plus approximately 300 workers at the former premises of the company in Whitehall Foundry. In 1897, the Transatlantic Company of Paris ordered two of a total of ten fast mail steamers for their African service at A & J Inglis. Inglis delivered two weeks ahead of their competitors. The French owners were impressed and checked carefully that the fast-track build programme had not resulted in an inferior quality, but found no evidence of this, on the contrary they were delighted with the high standard of construction achieved. Harland and Wolff bought controlling shares in the company in 1919 but the yard remained independent. After Harland and Wolff, who also owned a larger yard on the opposite bank of the river at Govan, opted to consolidate its operations in Belfast, the yard closed in 1962 and is now the site of the new Riverside Museum. Ships =Clippers and yachts= was launched in 1865 Norman Court was launched in 1869 Some of the first ships built by the shipyard were propelled by a combination of sails and steam engines. Because of their elegant design and high speed they were recognised as leading-edge representatives of their class. The shipyard became famous by building the British Royal Yacht and the Egyptian Royal Yacht . The turbine yacht was built of steel, rigged as a triple screw schooner and, unusually, was powered by steam turbines.Luca Papaluca: The Royal Thames Yacht Club's steam yacht Ianara =Paddle steamers= PS Hankow was built for the China Navigation Company in 1874 was launched in 1905. She was of a light design with small paddle wheels, which did not protrude above the promenade deck. The paddle steamer Famous ships built by the firm include the paddle steamer , now the world's last seagoing paddle steamer. Other Inglis-built paddle steamers include the , which still serves as a visitor attraction on Loch Lomond, and the forerunner to the Humber Bridge, which was controversially broken up in situ at Grimsby's Alexandra Dock, despite her uniqueness of design as what was likely to have been Inglis's only cargo carrying estuary paddle steamer; designed chiefly as a practical workhorse as opposed to a more elegant 'pleasure steamer' image more commonly associated with paddle steamers. In ocean-going service, paddle steamers became much less useful after the invention of the screw propeller, but they remained in use in coastal service and as river tugboats, thanks to their shallow draught and good manoeuvrability. =Conversions and extensions= The shipyard was also specialised in conversions: On 16 May 1901 the TS King Edward was launched, which had been built by William Denny and Brothers in Dumbarton. The builders hoped to attain a speed of with the turbine machinery. However, on 24 June 1901 in seven return runs over the mile, the best mean speed attained was . On the next day at the Pointhouse yard of A. & J. Inglis the central propeller of diameter was exchanged for one of diameter, and the outer propellers of diameter were exchanged for propellers diameter. Trials on 26 June 1901 achieved a mean of . In 1905, an extension and rebuild of the SS Mahroussa was undertaken. The ship had been originally built for Isma'il Pasha, the Khedive of Egypt and was later renamed to SS El Horria. The two paddle wheels were replaced by triple screws powered by steam turbines built by Inglis at their Warroch Street Engine Works in Glasgow. Inglis were one of the first companies licensed by the Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company Wallsend for the manufacture of steam turbines in their own works. The ship was still in use in 2001 as a luxury yacht.Joe Rossano: Royal Dahabiyas and Yachts =Railway ferries= Inglis built eight ferries between 1907 and 1929 for the Entre Rios Railways Co. in Argentina.

Lightships The North Carr Lightship was launched in 1932 and created quite a stir in Edinburgh on account of her fog horn being tested while lying ¬æ mile off Granton, Edinburgh in the Firth of Forth. As the fog horn had a range of approximately 10 miles, north Edinburgh could hear it loud and clear and the complaints were numerous - particularly as it was being sounded in clear weather. \\"Hundreds of city dwellers have had no sleep over three consecutive nights\\" and \\"The most flagrant individual breach of the peace is as nothing compared with the ceaseless boom and consequent suffering of the past three nights\\" were typical statements at the time.

It was historically West Lothian's county town, reflected in the county's alternative name of Linlithgowshire. An ancient town, it lies south of its two most prominent landmarks: Linlithgow Palace and Linlithgow Loch, and north of the Union Canal. Linlithgow's patron saint is Saint Michael and its motto is . A statue of the saint holding the burgh coat of arms stands on the High Street. Location Linlithgow is located in the north-east of West Lothian, close to the border with the Falkirk Council area (historically part of Stirlingshire). It lies west of Edinburgh along the main railway route to Glasgow. Before the construction of the M8 and M9 motorways and the opening of the Forth Road Bridge, the town lay on the main road from Edinburgh to Stirling, Perth and Inverness, while the canal system linked the burgh to Edinburgh and Glasgow. The nearby village of Blackness once served as the burgh's port. Linlithgow is overlooked by its local hill, Cockleroi. Etymology The name Linlithgow comes from the Old British lynn llaith cau meaning \\"lake in the damp hollow\\". Originally \\"Linlithgow\\" referred to the loch itself, the town being known as just \\"Lithgow\\" (hence the common surname). Folk etymology associated this name with the Gaelic liath-ch√π meaning \\"grey dog\\", likely the origin of the black bitch on the burgh arms. History The chief historic attraction of Linlithgow is the remains of Linlithgow Palace, the birthplace of James V and Mary, Queen of Scots, and probably Scotland's finest surviving late medieval secular building. The present palace was started (on an older site) in 1424 by James I of Scotland. It was burnt in 1746,https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/9178/linlithgow- railway-station-town-hall-st-michaels-church-and-palace-centre-background and, whilst unroofed, it is still largely complete in terms of its apartments, though very few of the original furnishings survived. Linlithgow Palace from the public park surrounding it, known as The Peel Linlithgow was also the site of the Battle of Linlithgow Bridge at the western edge of the town. The bridge no longer stands. The roadway to Linlithgow over the River Avon is described by scholars as a lifted road. Besides the palace, a second attraction, standing adjacent, is the 15th century St. Michael's Church. Its western tower originally had a distinctive stone crown spire, of the type seen also on St Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh, and Newcastle Cathedral, but it was damaged in a storm in 1768 then removed in 1821.https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-st-michaels-church-and- linlithgow-palace-from-the-southeast-d13656 In 1964 a controversial replacement spire in aluminium in a modern style by Scots architect Sir Basil Spence, representing Christ's crown of thorns, was added. Cross Well, Linlithgow Many historic buildings line the High Street. On the south side ground levels rise and several historic wynds and closes, as found in Edinburgh still exist. The most prominent space is on axis with the road to the palace. This contains the Cross Well of 1807 (redesigned by James Haldane) which proclaims itself to be a replica of its 1628 predecessor. North of the well stands the Town House of 1668 by the master mason John Smith. This replaced a previous hall or Tolbooth demolished by Oliver Cromwell's army in 1650. Much of its original interior was removed in a modernisation project of 1962.Buildings of Scotland: Lothian, by Colin McWilliam In June 1622 Katherine Rannald (alias Broun) from Kilpunt and her daughter Barbara Home (alias Winzet) were imprisoned in the Tolbooth on suspicion of witchcraft.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1895), p. 750. Linlithgow has been cited as the location of the first petrol pump in Scotland. \\"A plaque on the High Street records that Scotland's first petrol pump was installed at a garage here in 1919.\\" Coat of arms Linlithgow's Black Bitch The burgh's coat of arms features a black bitch chained to an oak tree on an island, and those born within the town are known as \\"black bitches\\". In his account of a tour of Scotland, published in 1679, an English gentleman, Thomas Kirk, described the arms of the town as \\"a black bitch tied to a tree, in a floating island. We enquired for a story about it, but could meet with none: their schoolmaster told us it proceeded from the name of the place. Linlithgow, in Erst [Gaelic], is thus explained: Lin signifies Lough; Lith, black; and Gow, a hound.\\" A more recently recorded legend relates that the bitch was a black greyhound whose master was sentenced to starve to death on an island in the loch. She used to swim from the town every day with food for him. When this was discovered she was chained to a tree on a different island to suffer the same fate as her master. The townspeople took the animal's loyalty and bravery as symbolic of their own. The local pub named \\"The Black Bitch\\" is reputed to be one of Scotland's oldest pubs. Development The south side of the High Street was spared the demolition inflicted upon the north side in the 1960s. Two large tracts of the northern side of the High Street were demolished in the 1960s and replaced by flats and public buildings in the brutalist style typical of that time period. Although these buildings were no doubt welcomed at the time as a vast improvement on what must have been cramped and dilapidated traditional accommodation, they were poorly conceived and constructed and have required extensive maintenance and renovation over the years. Many locals lament the brutal effect these buildings have had on the character and appearance of the town's main thoroughfare, and indeed such a dramatic remodelling of buildings forming such an integral part of the town would be unthinkable nowadays. Today the town is especially popular with middle classes and commuters, not only because of its transport links with Edinburgh, Glasgow and Stirling, but also because of the perceived quality of its schooling. The town grew considerably during the 1990s with the completion of several housing developments on the east side of the town. Though there is little scope for the town to grow further (as it is now bounded by green belt to the south and east, the M9 to the north, the river Avon and county boundary to the West and with the east side of the town having limited access to the M9) a planning application by Wallace Land for its proposals for a residential and retail development at Burghmuir was submitted in early February 2012. The town also now suffers from parking problems and the local schools are running to full capacity due to the massive increase in population over the last ten years. Linlithgow is also home to a major computing centre owned by Oracle. Former industries include the St. Magdalene's distillery, the Nobel explosives works, paper mills and many tanneries. Geography Linlithgow Canal Basin The town has a generally east‚Äìwest orientation and is centred on what used to be the main Edinburgh-Stirling road; this now forms the main thoroughfare called the High Street. Plots of farmed land, known as rigs, ran perpendicular to the High Street and comprised much of the town's development until the 19th century. Growth was restricted to the north by Linlithgow Loch, and by the steep hill to the south, but, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, development began much further south of the High Street. In the late 20th century, demand for housing led to many residential developments much further south, as well as spreading into new areas. This southward development was bisected by the Union Canal and latterly by the main Edinburgh-Glasgow railway line, and today there are traffic problems because there are only three places in the town where each of these can be crossed. To the west, Linlithgow Bridge used to be a somewhat distinct village with its own identity, but in the latter half of the 20th century it was enveloped in the expansion of the main town. Today the distinction between them is hard to make out.  Politics  Long a Labour stronghold, Linlithgow's political scene has changed dramatically in line with the rise of the Scottish National Party across the country in the early 21st Century. = UK Parliament = At Westminster, Linlithgow has been included in the Linlithgow and East Falkirk constituency since 2005. Linlithgow was a safe Labour seat until the SNP landslide of 2015 when sitting MP Michael Connarty was defeated by Martyn Day of the SNP. Day successfully defended the seat in the 2017 snap election despite his lead diminishing by 7 percentage points. = Scottish Parliament = At Holyrood, Linlithgow is represented by the SNP's Fiona Hyslop, the Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs. Prior to the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, the town was represented by Mary Mulligan of Labour. It is also part of the Lothian electoral region, which elected 3 Conservative, 2 Labour and 2 Green MSPs under the additional member system in 2016. = West Lothian Council = At both the 2012 and 2017 local elections, Linlithgow ward elected one Conservative, one Labour and one SNP councillor, namely Tom Kerr, Tom Conn and David Tait respectively. = British Army = Following the formation of the Territorial Force the town was allocated, for recruiting, to the Lothians and Border Horse and 10th Battalion, Royal Scots. Today 1 SCOTS recruit from the area keeping the traditions of the area from the Royal Scots. Facilities and leisure Linlithgow's rich history and central location make it a popular tourist destination, while many local people commute to Glasgow, Edinburgh or Stirling; this is made relatively easy by the town's railway station and its proximity to both the M8 and M9 motorways. The town is served by three supermarkets and a retail park situated in Linlithgow Bridge. There are also a diverse range of local retailers in the High Street. There are controversial proposals for a new retail development to the east of the town. These are being opposed by a local lobby group. Linlithgow is big enough to have facilities for most common participation sports. Linlithgow Rose Community Football Club (formed from a partnership of Linlithgow Rose Football Club and BFC Linlithgow) has about 500 player members, involved in soccer 4s, soccer 7s, girls, youth and adult amateur football. The club has a dedicated goalkeeping school and referee training programme and has been awarded Community Level status in both the SFA Quality Mark and West Lothian Council Club Accreditation schemes. Linlithgow is also host to Linlithgow Rose Football Club, Linlithgow Thistle AFC and Linlithgow Rugby Football Club as well as West Lothian County Cricket Association Linlithgow also hosts two main registered Scotland Supporters Clubs for the Scottish National football team: Linlithgow & District Tartan Army (LADTA) and the Young Linlithgow Tartan Army (YLTA). The eastern end of Linlithgow Loch from the Peel. A number of local parks, including play areas for children, are spread throughout the burgh, with the tract of land surrounding the palace known as the Peel being particularly popular in summer. Low Port Outdoor Education Centre is situated next to the loch and provides facilities for many outdoor activities, many based on the adjacent loch. Nearby country parks include Beecraigs and Muiravonside. Linlithgow golf club, founded in 1913, sits to the south of the canal on the western edge of town. Educational establishments in the town include Linlithgow Academy, which regularly appears close to the top of the school league tables in Scotland and is one of the main reasons for the demand for housing in Linlithgow, and five primary schools: Linlithgow Primary School, St Joseph's Primary School, Linlithgow Bridge Primary School, Low Port Primary School and Springfield Primary School. Donaldson's College, Scotland's national school for the deaf, relocated from Edinburgh to a new building in Linlithgow in 2008. The Riding of the Marches, held in one form or another since the mid-16th century and nowadays celebrated on the first Tuesday after the second Thursday in June, involves young and old in the tradition of checking the burgh's perimeter, including the town's historic port of Blackness. Although today's activities are centred more on the colourful parades through the town that involve bands and floats decorated by local groups, the more ceremonial duties of the Marches are still performed, and a variety of local groups ensure that the traditions, old and new, are maintained. There are many other events during the year such as the Children's Gala Day, the Linlithgow Folk Festival and a pre-Christmas Victorian Street Fayre, and since 2014, Party at the Palace which is a music festival held annually in August by the loch and has brought acts including Nile Rodgers, Kaiser Chiefs, Travis, Simple Minds, The Proclaimers, Texas and many others to play in the town. The Charlatans and Deacon Blue headline Party at the Palace 2019. The sense of community is enhanced by many active local groups such as Linlithgow Amateur Musical Productions (LAMP), Lithca Lore, the Linlithgow Players and the 41 Club. The town also has its own weekly local newspaper, the Linlithgow Gazette. The Linlithgow Union Canal Society runs a canal museum and operates narrowboat tours from Manse Road basin. The town has two Church of Scotland parish churches: St Michael's and the smaller St. Ninian's Craigmailen. There are also churches of other denominations, including a Methodist chapel (now an evangelical church, St. John's, which meets in Linlithgow Academy on a Sunday morning); St Peter's, an architecturally distinctive Scottish Episcopal church; and a Roman Catholic church, also called St Michael's, which was used as an ambulance depot by Polish servicemen during the Second World War.

Nurse-led clinics have assumed distinct roles over the years, and examples exist within hospital outpatient departments,Rudra, N. (2009, May). Heat on nurse-led clinic to succeed, in Canberra Times public health clinics Sussex County, New Jersey (2002). Public Health Nursing Page and independent practice environments.Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (2009, June). Introduction to nurse practitioner-led clinics. Definition A broad definition of a nurse-led clinic defines these clinics based on what nursing activities are performed at the site.Hatchett, R. (2003). Nurse-Led Clinics: Practice Issues. New York, NY: Routledge. Nurses within a nurse-led clinic assume their own patient case-loads, provide an educative role to patients to promote health, provide psychological support, monitor the patient's condition and perform nursing interventions. Advanced practice registered nurses, usually nurse practitioners, may have expanded roles within these clinics, depending on the scope of practice defined by their state, provincial or territorial government. Overview The recent growth of nurse-led clinics is considered an emerging area of nursing practice; they were originally discussed in nursing journals in the 1980s, and developed over the 1990s into practice areas that have generated financial, legal and professional challenges over the years. There has been recent growth of nurse-led clinics both within hospitals and in the community. However, that growth has been unequal across different legislative regions. As an example, Canada's only known nurse-led clinics exist in Ontario.Hodges, D. (2009, July). Ontario docs concerned by nurse-led clinics. Retrieved from \\\\--~~~~www.everbetter.ca, originally published in The Medical Post. Unlike many clinics which exist in the United States, Ontario's clinics have been met with some criticism from the Ontario Medical Association and some family physicians who view nurse-led clinics to be unproven innovations in primary care. In the UK, advanced nursing practice developed in the 1980s in response to increased health needs and cost, and in keeping with health policy. A later impetus came from the ‚ÄúNew deal for junior doctors‚Äù which was a government response to the European Community directive to reduce junior doctors' hours of work. Nurse-led clinics typically focus on chronic disease management: conditions where regular follow-up and expertise is required, but also where a patient may not necessarily need to see a physician at every visit. Most nurse-led clinics use nursing theory and knowledge to educate patients and form care plans to manage their conditions. Nursing consultations In their consultations, nurses undertake a range of activities. This may include a specific task such as giving patient education, assessment and management of cardiovascular risks, managing blood pressure, exacerbations of COPD and overall disease management. Review of evidence Nurse-led clinics have a brief history of evaluation in scientific literature. Not only is there a large amount of heterogeneity between nurse-led clinics, but there are also different educational backgrounds for nurses who wish to enter these roles. In a partially blind randomized controlled trial, adult patients with Type II Diabetes were found to have better control of hypertension and hyperlipidemia in a nurse-led clinic when compared to conventional follow-up care. A related study also found that nurse-led clinics were more effective than conventional care in controlling hypertension for adult patients with Type II Diabetes and uncontrolled hypertension. Generally, it was found that most patients experienced improved outcomes following nurse-led clinic consultation, with the best improvement rates found for wound care and continence clinics. Randomised controlled trials in rheumatology have demonstrated that nurse-led clinics are effective in controlling disease activity in people with rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, three studies have demonstrated cost effectiveness on this model of care in Denmark, the Netherlands and the UK. Many nurse-led clinics have also been associated with enhanced patient satisfaction with care. A nurse-led clinic for intractable constipation in paediatric populations was compared to a paediatric gastroenterology clinic, illustrating that parent satisfaction was significantly higher for those who attended the nurse-led clinic. This has also been shown in rheumatology nurse- led clinics. In areas where nursing practice may require additional support to maintain patient safety, some nurse-led clinics have implemented decision support tools, computerized systems and evidence-based algorithms to support their practice. Nurse-led clinics which utilize computerized decision support tools to manage oral anticoagulation dosages were found be to as effective as hospital-based clinics for INR control and stability. In the UK, nurse-led care has been established in many chronic conditions such as diabetes, COPD and musculoskeletal disorders. Treatment guidelines in rheumatoid arthritis for example, specify the role of the nurse in managing the disease and coordinating care.NICE. Rheumatoid arthritis: The management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults. Secondary Rheumatoid arthritis: The management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults [Online] August 2013 2009. http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG79NICEGuideline.pdf The evidence for the effectiveness of nurse-led intervention is growing and increasingly supported by randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews.

He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Westbury from 1964 to 1992. Early life The son of Douglas Walters and Clara Pomello, Walters was of English and Italian descent and was brought up as a Roman Catholic. At the outbreak of the Second World War he was in Italy and was interned, but after the Armistice of 1943 he was released and served for eleven months with the Italian Resistance. He then returned to England and was educated at Downside School and St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he read Modern Languages.Dennis Walters, Not Always With the Pack (London: Constable, 1989), p. 26 et seq. Career In the late 1950s, Walters was employed as personal assistant to the Conservative peer Lord Hailsham throughout his chairmanship of the Conservative Party.Walters, op. cit., p. 86. In 1960, he was appointed MBE for political services. At the 1959 general election, Walters contested Blyth for the Conservatives, fighting the seat again the next year at a by-election after Alf Robens was promoted to the House of Lords.Walters, op. cit., pp. 106‚Äì108 In October 1962 he was selected as his party's candidate for the safe seat of Westbury,Walters, op. cit., p. 108 which he represented as Member of Parliament (MP) for 28 years from 1964. During his early years in the Commons he worked closely with Shadow Foreign Secretary Sir Alec Douglas-Home, of whom he later wrote \\"I could not imagine a more considerate, fair, or civilised person to serve.\\"Walters, op. cit., p. 145 Following the Six-Day War of 1967, Walters visited Palestine with his parliamentary colleague Ian Gilmour, and in a joint statement they said \\"The Israeli attitude to the refugees becomes clearer when their return rather than their expulsion is considered. Most people in Britain probably believe that Israel has agreed to their return and that repatriation is now satisfactorily proceeding. Nothing could be further from the truth.\\"Sami Hadawi, Bitter Harvest: a modern history of Palestine (1991), p. 147 This was an early signal of the willingness of Walters and Gilmour to work closely together to explain the Arab point of view to the Western world, and they became close allies.Alan Watkins, Brief lives: with some memoirs (1982), p. 51 Outside parliament, Walters served as Chairman of Middle East International, founded in 1971 with \\"a mission to provide authoritative and independent news and analysis on the Middle East.\\" A sympathiser with Arab interests, from 1970 to 1982 he was Chairman of the Council for the Advancement of Arab-British Understanding and from 1978 to 1981 joint Chairman of the Euro-Arab Parliamentary Association. He was also a company director with interests in investment, advertising, public relations and travel. When the Conservatives returned to government in 1979, Walters's well-known pro-Arabism cost him the chance of advancement as a Foreign Office minister, the area in which his hopes lay, as in the shape of Gilmour Margaret Thatcher was willing to appoint one pro-Arab colleague, but not two.Walters, op. cit., p. 192 Walters was knighted in 1988 and retired from parliament in 1992, to be succeeded as member for Westbury by David Faber.

The comics series The Adventures of Tintin first appeared in its pages. History Le Vingti√®me Si√®cle was a Catholic and conservative newspaper published in Brussels, led by abbot Norbert Wallez. In 1925, 18-year-old Herg√© (Georges Prosper Remi), the creator of Tintin, worked there, first as a clerk and, after he fulfilled his military service, as an illustrator for the main pages and for some supplements like the weekly arts pages and the women's section. In 1928, the abbot decided to start a weekly 8-page youth supplement, appearing every Thursday. He called it Le Petit Vingti√®me (The Little Twentieth). Herg√© was named Editor-in-Chief. In the first issue, appearing on 1 November 1928, he illustrated a short comic made by Desmedt, the sports editor of the newspaper called Les Aventures de Flup, N√©nesse, Poussette et Cochonnet. Sensing that this comic lacked spirit and was rather old-fashioned compared to the current American comics and to the works of Alain Saint-Ogan, Herg√© started working on his own comic. In 1927 he met Germaine Kieckens, the secretary of the abbot at the newspaper. They were engaged in 1932 and married on 20 July the same year. On 10 January 1929, in issue 11, Tintin in the Land of the Soviets began. Every issue featured two pages of the story, and Herg√© often made covers for the supplement depicting Tintin as well. A year later, on 23 January 1930, the supplement increased from eight to 16 pages, and the first page of Quick & Flupke, a new gag strip, appeared in the magazine. 310 gags would appear before the paper folded. The supplement, especially the comics, was an overwhelming success, with circulation of the publication quadrupling on Thursdays. At the end of each of the first three stories of The Adventures of Tintin, an actual reception of the comic hero (played by an actor) at the station in Brussels was organized, with thousands of people attending. The first of these was attended by Zita of Bourbon-Parma, the former empress of Austria, and her children. In the meantime the first assistants to Herg√© were hired to help him fill the supplement and to do minor work on Tintin and Quick & Flupke: Eug√®ne Van Nijverseel, better known as Evany, and Paul Jamin (also signing as Jam). To capitalize on the success, a new publishing house was started, Les √©ditions du Petit Vingti√®me. It published the first three books of Tintin and the first two of Quick & Flupke before folding and passing the rights in 1934 to Casterman, which was better suited to cope with the international success of Tintin (which by then also appeared in France and Switzerland). Both the newspaper comics and the album publications were in black and white, although the covers to the supplement, which were also often made by Herg√©, used a supporting colour. Between 8 February and 16 August 1934, Herg√© also published the more juvenile story Les aventures de Popol et Virginie chez les Lapinos (translated as Popol out west). This story was only first published as an album (in French) in 1952 though.Other works by Herg√© In February 1940, an attempt was made to launch De Bengel, a Dutch translation of Le Petit Vingti√®me. This magazine marked the first appearance of Tintin in Dutch. The magazine seems to have never been distributed though, and only one copy is known to exist.GvA Kuifje-dossier (in Dutch).

History =Church of England in Virginia= Anglicanism came to Virginia in 1607 with the settlers who founded Jamestown. The charter of the London Company instructed them to adhere to the practices of the Church of England, and between 1607 and its dissolution in 1624, the company sent 22 ministers to the colony. These ministers were not only concerned for the spiritual lives of the colonists but also attempted (largely unsuccessfully) to convert the Native Americans. When Virginia's General Assembly first met in 1619, it passed a series of laws concerning the church, including formally designating the Church of England as the established church of the colony. To keep pace with the colony's growth, the Burgesses ordered each settlement to set aside a house or room as a place to hold regular worship services.Edward L. Bond and Joan R. Gundersen (2007), \\"The Episcopal Church in Virginia, 1607-2007\\", Virginia Magazine of History & Biography 115, no. 2: Chapter 1. After Virginia was made a royal colony in 1624, it would face an acute and serious clergy shortage until the end of the 17th century. The shortage was fueled by an expanding population and insufficient clergy recruitment despite efforts to attract ministers by offering incentives, such as tax breaks. This forced parishes to rely on lay readers to lead prayers and read published sermons. The absence of North American bishops necessitated that colonists desiring ordination make the dangerous trip to and from England. It also meant children could not be confirmed, which meant (prior to 1662) that they could not receive communion, although many clergymen overlooked this requirement. In this vacuum, the legislature assumed some episcopal functions, such as outlining the responsibilities of clergymen and providing for their financial maintenance. It created a vestry system in 1642-1643 that was lay dominated, a radical departure from the English system where rectors were nominated by parish patrons and usually held office for life. In Virginia, vestries, usually consisting of 12 wealthy men, could appoint and remove ministers. Colonial parishes were units of local government and social welfare agencies. In addition to paying the minister's salary and building churches, the parish levy provided the vestry with funding for poor relief. Vestries were in charge of road maintenance, presented moral offenders to the county courts, and determined the legal bounds of an individual's land. It was not until Henry Compton was appointed Bishop of London that the hierarchy of the English Church would address the problems in America. Compton not only worked to improve the quality of the colony's ministers but appointed commissaries to act on his behalf. Commissaries could \\"summon the clergy, conduct visitations, administer oaths customary in ecclesiastical courts, and administer discipline or judicial proceedings to wayward clergy either by admonition, suspension, or excommunication\\" but could not ordain to the priesthood. The first commissary, Henry Clayton, arrived in 1684 but left two years later. His successor, James Blair, held the office for 54 years, from 1689 to his death in 1743. Blair was successful in establishing parishes in every county. He was also committed to educating colonial men for the ministry, establishing the College of William and Mary in 1693. Compton's attention brought stability to Virginia's church and by 1703 nearly 80 percent of Virginia's 50 parishes had ministers. Until the Great Awakening of the 1740s, the Church of England faced few challenges apart from small groups of Quakers. During the Awakening, however, Presbyterians and Baptists emerged as a threat to the religious establishment. Baptists especially resented the privileged status of the Anglican Church and laws requiring that the government license dissenting ministers. The Great Awakening also inspired an evangelical movement within the established church, much of which would eventually be absorbed by Methodism. By the 1750s and 1760s, however, the Church of England in Virginia was stable and prosperous. =Piety= In the 1740s the Anglican church had about 70 parish priests around the colony. There was no bishop, and indeed, there was fierce political opposition to having a bishop in the colony. George William Pilcher, \\"The Pamphlet War On The Proposed Virginia Anglican Episcopate, 1767-1775,\\" Historical Magazine of the Protestant Episcopal Church, 1961, Vol. 30 Issue 4, pp 266-279 The Anglican priests were supervised directly by the distant Bishop of London, who paid little attention. Each county court gave tax money to the local vestry, composed of prominent layman. The vestry provided the priest a glebe of 200 or , a house, and perhaps some livestock. The vestry paid him an annual salary of . of tobacco, plus 20 shillings for every wedding and funeral. While not poor, the priests lived modestly and their opportunities for improvement were slim. Ministers reported that the colonists were typically inattentive, uninterested, and bored during church services. According to the ministers' complaints, the people were sleeping, whispering, ogling the fashionably-dressed women, walking about and coming and going, or at best looking out the windows or staring blankly into space. Jacob M. Blosser, \\"Irreverent Empire: Anglican Inattention in an Atlantic World,\\" Church History, Sept 2008, Vol. 77 Issue 3, pp 596-628 By 1740, the acute shortage of clergy was easing, and by 1776, there were more Anglican clergy living in Virginia than there were parishes. Devout parishioners used the Book of Common Prayer for private prayer and devotion. This allowed devout Anglicans to lead an active and sincere religious life in addition to the formal church services. However the stress on private devotion weakened the need for a bishop or a large institutional church of the sort Blair wanted. The stress on personal piety opened the way for the First Great Awakening, which pulled people away from the established church. Edward L. Bond, \\"Anglican theology and devotion in James Blair's Virginia, 1685-1743,\\" Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, 1996, Vol. 104 Issue 3, pp 313-40 =Revolution= The American Revolution was a difficult time for the Anglican Church in America. Clergymen were divided between allegiance to their king and their state. As public officials, ministers were required to swear loyalty to the state, breaking the Oath of Supremacy in the process. Some were able to do this, but those who could not either resigned or withdrew from parish duties while continuing to provide pastoral care. There were calls for dis- establishment, but powerful church members resisted drastic change. In 1777, the legislature passed bills recognizing the church's right to its property and the right of the clergy to occupy the glebes. Clerical salaries were suspended and ended entirely in 1780. Thus for much of the war the Anglican Church faced an identity crisis. It was a state church controlled by a government refusing to fund it. The war also led to the breakdown of the vestry system as refugees strained parish resources and desperate vestrymen resigned or petitioned the state to dissolve their vestries.Bond and Gundersen (2007), Chapter 2. =Postwar Episcopalians= After the American Revolution, when freedom of religion and the separation of church and state became dominant ideas, the Church of England was dis-established in Virginia. A few ministers were Loyalists and had returned to England. When it began organizing as a diocese after the Revolution about 50 Episcopal clergy were still active in the state. The lack of a steady means of pay and natural aging continued to reduce the number of clergy. Reforms at the College of William and Mary resulted in no place for Episcopal clergy to study for ordination. The clergy shortage deepened over time. When possible, worship continued in the usual fashion, but the local vestry was no longer the unit of local government and no longer handled tax money. The Right Reverend James Madison (1749‚Äì1812) (a cousin of politician James Madison), was elected in 1790 as the first Episcopal Bishop of Virginia and slowly rebuilt the denominationThomas E. Buckley, Church and state in Revolutionary Virginia, 1776-1787 (1977) After the war ended, Episcopalians (as Anglicans were now calling themselves) recognized the need to be in control of their own church. In April 1784, a meeting of Virginia ministers asked the legislature to relinquish control over the church and to issue an act of incorporation. In October, it passed an incorporation bill which placed the government of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the hands of an annual convention with both lay and clerical representatives. However, the state continued to create new parishes and set parish boundaries, oversee vestry elections, and require county courts to review parish finances for several more years. For its part, the Episcopal Church continued to hold a monopoly on performing marriages. The first convention was held May 1785. It elected a standing committee, elected deputies to the first General Convention of the Episcopal Church in September, and created canons. The canons ensured that laity would participate in the trial of clergymen accused of misconduct and that bishops would have no authority except to oversee clerical conduct, perform confirmations and ordinations, and preside at the convention. At the second Virginia convention, in 1786, the Rev. Dr. David Griffith, who was both a surgeon and a priest, was elected to become the first Bishop of Virginia. He lacked the funds, however, to travel to England for his consecration, and in 1789, resigned his election, fell ill and died. The following year, James Madison, the president of the College of William and Mary, rector of James City parish, and cousin of the future president of the same name, was elected to become the first Bishop of Virginia, traveled to England and was consecrated.http://www.thediocese.net/diocese/history.shtml In 1786, the Virginia Assembly passed the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, written by Thomas Jefferson and supported by James Madison. It also repealed the act of incorporation for the Virginia church and took from the vestries the oversight of poor relief. Baptists and Presbyterians were proposing that all property of the colonial parishes‚Äîglebes, church buildings, church yards, communion silver, and Bibles‚Äîbe sold for the benefit of all Virginians. Even with a 1788 law confirming the Episcopal Church's rights to the colonial church's property and the repeal of all laws creating an established church in 1799, efforts to dis-endow the Episcopal Church continued. In 1801, the General Assembly passed a law authorizing county overseers of the poor to sell property of the former established church, using the money for education and the poor. As late as 1814, the General Assembly was still authorizing the sale of specific parishes' silver and bells, and in 1841, the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals ruled in a case involving the seizure of a parish glebe. After the Episcopal Church lost a challenge to the 1801 law, Bishop Madison focused on keeping the College of William and Mary going. Congestive heart failure made it difficult for Madison to travel, and the diocese suffered decline that lasted past Madison's death as once again the elected candidate declined the position. The next Bishop, Richard Channing Moore led the rebuilding of the diocese. The opening of the Virginia Theological Seminary in Alexandria in 1823, under the guidance of William Holland Wilmer (who ultimately but briefly succeeded Madison as president of the College of William and Mary) and William Meade (who later succeeded Moore) provided the diocese with the source of clergy it needed to rebuild. =Civil War and Aftermath= During the Civil War, West Virginia separated from Virginia and in 1877 that part of the Diocese of Virginia lying within the bounds of West Virginia became the Diocese of West Virginia. In 1892, The southern part of the diocese became the Diocese of Southern Virginia, and from that diocese, another emerged (the Diocese of Southwestern Virginia) in 1919. The boundaries of the Diocese of Virginia have remained unchanged since 1892. Edward L. Bond and Joan R. Gundersen (2007), \\"The Episcopal Church in Virginia, 1607-2007\\", Virginia Magazine of History & Biography 115, no. 2: Chapter 5. =Recent history= In recent decades, the diocese has experienced the effects of Anglican realignment as some conservative congregations withdrew from the diocese and the national Episcopal Church. Many of these congregations formed the Anglican Diocese of the Mid-Atlantic. In 2012, the diocese reclaimed legal access to Episcopal church properties that had been claimed by seven of the departing congregations, which included an unsuccessful appeal to the Supreme Court by Anglican members at The Falls Church.http://www.thediocese.net/who- we-are/history/property-recovery-litigation/ Bishops These are the bishops who have served the Diocese of Virginia:The Episcopal Church Annual.

In 1997, the archipelago, together with Portovenere and the Cinque Terre, was designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.

Some place it in the ninth century. His feast is celebrated here annually on 13 September. It is thought that a sanctuary was constructed at the place of Venerio's death to contain his remains and that this was extended to form a monastery in eleventh century. The remains of the monastery can be seen on the northern coast of the island. Today the island, which is part of a military zone, is surmounted by the San Venerio Lighthouse.

A Thai curry dish is made from curry paste, coconut milk or water, meat, seafood, vegetables or fruit, and herbs. Curries in Thailand mainly differ from the curries in Indian cuisine in their use of ingredients such as herbs and aromatic leaves over a mix of spices. Overview Some of the fresh ingredients for red curry paste Thai people refer to dishes that are known as \\"Thai curries\\" in the Western world as \\"kaeng\\" (also written as \\"gaeng\\"; , ). The first Thai dictionary from 1873 CE (2416 in the Thai Buddhist calendar) defines kaeng as a watery dish to be eaten with rice and utilizing shrimp paste, onions or shallots, chillies, and garlic as essential ingredients. Coconut milk is not included in this definition and many Thai curries, such as kaeng som and kaeng pa, do not feature it. Curries in Lanna (northern Thai) cuisine, with only a few exceptions, do not use coconut milk due to coconut palms not growing well, if at all, in the climate of the Thai highlands. The spiciness of Thai curries depends on the amount and kind of chilli used in the making of the paste. Even within one type of curry the spiciness can differ widely. The word \\"curry\\" figures in the Thai language as \\"kari\\" (), and refers to dishes using either an Indian-style curry powder, known as phong kari in Thailand, or to the dish called kaeng kari, an Indian-influenced curry that is made with spices that are common to Indian dishes but less often used in these proportions in Thai cuisine. Kung phat phong kari (prawns fried with egg and curry powder) is an example of a dish using the Indian style curry powder. Although \\"kaeng\\" is also defined as being of \\"watery\\" substance, the thickness of the sauce can vary considerably from broth-like to that of a thick stew, and it can even be a completely dry dish. Representatives of dry curries, dishes which are (stir-)fried with a curry paste, are phat phrik khing and khua khling. Kaeng som and keang pa are representatives of the more broth-like curries. Matsaman and kaeng khua resemble stews. Ho mok (a fish curry \\"souffl√©\\"), kaeng kradang (curry aspic from northern Thailand) and noodle dishes such as khanom chin nam ngiao are also seen as Thai curry dishes as they all use curry pastes in their preparation. The dish called kaeng shuet is an exception to the rule that a kaeng should contain chillies, garlic, onions and shrimp paste. It is a clear Chinese style meat and/or vegetable broth with mixed vegetables and often also minced pork, tofu and glass noodles. The name translates as \\"bland curry\\" but it is seen as being a tom, a soup, and it is therefore also often called tom chuet. Curries are eaten in combination with rice, the long-grained jasmine rice in central and southern Thailand and sticky rice in northern and northeastern Thailand, and with noodles such as khanom chin (fermented rice noodles). Certain curries can also be eaten with roti, the Thai version of the Indian-style fried flat bread from Malaysia called roti canai. Khao kaeng or khao rat kaeng, meaning \\"curry-on-rice\\", is a traditional type of fast food restaurant in Thailand which specialises in ready-made curries, and often several other dishes as well, served with rice. Their popularity in Bangkok as a place for a quick lunchtime meal is in decline. Typical ingredients Ingredients for green curry Different types of Thai curry pastes for sale at a market in Hat Yai, in southern Thailand =Curry paste= Thai curries are always made with a curry paste. Common ingredients used in many Thai curry pastes are: *Shrimp paste *Chillies; depending on the curry these can be dried or fresh, red or green *Onions or shallots *Garlic *Lemongrass *Galangal *Coriander (cilantro) root Depending on the type of curry, additional ingredients for the paste can include spices such as turmeric, pepper, coriander seeds, cardamom pods, and cumin, or other ingredients such as boiled fermented fish, and fingerroot. Ingredients are traditionally ground together with a mortar and pestle, though increasingly with an electric food processor. With many curries, the paste is first stir-fried in cooking oil before other components are added in to the dish. This allows certain flavours in the spices and other ingredients in the paste to develop that cannot be released at the lower temperature of boiling water. Both khrueang kaeng (lit. \\"kaeng ingredients\\") and nam phrik kaeng (lit. \\"kaeng chilli paste\\") are used to describe \\"curry paste\\" in Thailand. The latter is sometimes even shortened to only phrik kaeng (lit. \\"kaeng chilli\\"). Thai curry pastes can be made at home from the bare ingredients, bought freshly made at markets in Thailand, or they can be had packaged at shops and supermarkets. =Main ingredients= Most Thai curries are made with meat, fish or shellfish as their main ingredient. Vegetables and fruit, but also certain tree leaves such as from the Acacia pennata (cha-om) and the Ficus virens (phak lueat), and flowers such as those of the Sesbania grandiflora (dok khae) and banana (hua pli), can be added. Curries that contain mainly vegetables are, for example, kaeng liang (mixed vegetables) and kaeng nomai (bamboo shoots). Ingredients were dictated by regional and seasonal availability: both pork and chicken (possibly first domesticated from wild jungle fowl in what is now Thailand) are easily available, and so are many varieties of fish, and shellfish, both fresh water species from the many rivers, lakes and rice paddies, as well as salt water species from the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand. Other traditional ingredients in Thai curries include frogs, snakes, snails, wild birds and game such as Sambar deer and wild boar. Commonly used vegetables in curries are Thai eggplant (makhuea pro), yardlong beans (thua fak yao), and different types of squash and pumpkins (fak). =Additional ingredients= Fresh kaffir lime leaves (bai makrut), fingerroot (krachai), or fresh herbs such as Thai basil (horapa) are often added to Thai curries. Kaffir lime leaves and krachai are often cooked along with the other ingredients but fresh herbs such as Thai basil are nearly always added at the last moment to preserve the full taste and serve as a contrasting note to the flavours of a curry. Fish sauce is not only used when cooking the curry as a flavouring and for its salty taste, but it is usually also available at the table as a condiment, mixed together with sliced green bird's-eye chillies for those that prefer their curries more salty and spicy. Sugar (traditionally palm sugar) is used with curries that need to be sweetened. Besides lime juice, tamarind juice can also see use in sour curries as the souring agent such as in kaeng som. To achieve the most fragrance from the ingredients in a curry paste, the curry paste is often first fried together with vegetable oil or coconut oil that has separated from the coconut cream, before adding in the other ingredients.

She resides in Kamakura, Kanagawa Prefecture. She is included in the Year 24 Group, a term coined by academics and critics to refer to a group of female authors in the early 1970s who helped transform sh≈çjo manga (girls' comics) from being created primarily by male authors to being created by female authors.Ogi, F 2008, 'Sh√¥jo Manga (Japanese Comics for Girls) in the 1970s' Japan as a Message to Women's Bodies: Interviewing Keiko Takemiya ‚Äî A Leading Artist of the Year 24 Flower Group', International Journal of Comic Art, 10, 2, pp. 148-169, Art Full Text (H.W. Wilson), EBSCOhost, viewed 27 August 2015. As part of this group, Takemiya pioneered a genre of girls' comics about love between young men. In December 1970, she published a short story titled Sanr≈´mu Nite (\\"In the Sunroom\\") in Bessatsu Sh≈çjo Comic, which is possibly the first sh≈çnen-ai manga ever published and contains the earliest known male-male kiss in sh≈çjo manga. Takemiya cites her influences as being sh≈çnen manga, the work of Shotaro Ishinomori, films, and documentaries. In 1972, after publishing Sora ga Suki!, Takemiya traveled to Europe so that she could find out more about life there as research for Kaze to Ki no Uta. After that, she traveled to different parts of Europe on an almost annual basis. Among her most noted works are the manga Toward the Terra and Kaze to Ki no Uta, which are noted for being pioneering series of the 1970s and 1980s. She received the 1979 Shogakukan Manga Award for sh≈çjo manga and sh≈çnen manga respectively for Kaze to Ki no Uta and Terra e..., and the prestigious Seiun Award for science fiction manga in 1978 for Terra e.... She is regarded as \\"one of the first successful crossover women artists\\" to create both sh≈çjo and sh≈çnen manga. Many of her series have been adapted into anime, including Terra e... in 1980 and 2007, Natsu e no Tobira in 1981, and Kaze to Ki no Uta in 1987. In 1983, she served as special designer to the Sunrise theatrical film Crusher Joe: The Movie, alongside other noted manga artists Yumiko Igarashi, Fujihiko Hosono, Rumiko Takahashi, Hideo Azuma, Hisaichi Ishii, Katsuhiro Otomo, Miki Tori, Shinji Wada and Akira Toriyama.

It was fitted with a 4,561 cc V8 engine and was offered as a much more powerful supplement to their then current Daimler Majestic. A substantially lengthened limousine version of the same chassis and bodyshell, the Daimler DR450, was available from 1961 until the V8 engine ended production.

It was offered as a supplement alongside the slightly shorter 3.8-litre Majestic released in 1958. Both cars used the same chassis and bodyshell, the Major having an extended boot as well as the new engine which was lighter and much more powerful.Brian E. Smith The Daimler Tradition, Transport Bookman, Isleworth 1980. The engine transformed the staid Majestic into a high performance car capable of . Motor Sport magazine described the Major as having \\"sports car performance\\", while The Autocar stated that it appeared \\"almost as a sports saloon\\" and that it was stable directionally at high speeds and could be cornered safely very fast for such a large car. It was faster than a Mark X Jaguar up to despite its bulk, it has been said. Jaguar tested the engine in a Mark X which attained . External differences from the Majestic included a D motif on top of the bonnet, cast-in V symbols on the ventilation air intakes, six inches added to the length of the car which gave it a longer boot and longer bumper returns, and twin exhaust pipes. Front seats could be supplied as individual adjustable seats or as a bench. Engine Turner's engine produced a conservatively rated at 5500 rpm and of torque at 3,200 rpm. By comparison a Jaguar Mark X also claimed 220hp but used a different scale of measurement. Chassis and body The chassis of Majestic Major was an evolution of the design introduced in 1937 with the Daimler New Fifteen. As with the New Fifteen and several derivatives in between,Other models with these features include the Eighteen, the Consort, the Regency, the One-O-Four, and the Sportsman. the Majestic Major had a cruciform-braced box- section frame with conventional coil-sprung independent front suspension and a live rear axle on semi-elliptic leaf springs. As with the Majestic, there were four-wheel Dunlop disc brakes with a vacuum servo. The combination of an imported Borg-Warner DG (Detroit Gear) 250M automatic transmission, power steering and Dunlop's power disc brakes on all wheels made the Major in those respects a mechanically advanced car for its time. Its body, however, was originally designed for the Majestic by Daimler subsidiary, the old coachbuilding firm Carbodies and they provided the bodies in conjunction with Park Sheet Metal. They were finished in cellulose paints allowing a selection of colours not available in the new synthetic finishes used by Jaguar. They were built at Browns Lane on separate hand-moved lines. The Majestic Major's turning circle was . The car was not one for manoeuvering in tight spaces; 4.5 turns lock to lock were required. Power steering, initially optional, became standard after October 1964. Late versions were supplied with a limited slip differential and an alternator. The bodies were of all steel construction. Despite being coated with zinc phosphate, they rusted more rapidly than expected of coachwork on a Daimler chassis. Performance The British The Motor magazine tested a Majestic Major with power steering in 1961 and recorded a top speed of and acceleration from 0- in 9.7 seconds. A \\"touring\\" fuel consumption of 16.9 miles per gallon (imperial) was recorded. On the home market, as tested, the car cost ¬£3166 including taxes of ¬£955.

This was followed by a self released mini album Quirk Out produced by Hugh Jones which included their cult hit \\"Buffalo\\". \\"Buffalo\\" appeared on NME's influential C86 compilation and a video was made by Channel 4 which was shown on The Tube. Continuous UK touring, regular coverage in the UK music press - including cover features in both the NME and Melody Maker, and a return to The Tube for a live performance of \\"Tupperware Stripper\\", ensured that Quirk Out stayed in the UK Indie Charts for 26 weeks, peaking at number 2.Lazell, Barry (1997) Indie Hits 1980-89, , Cherry Red Books A session for the John Peel radio show recorded in February 1986 was released as a Peel Session EP on Strange Fruit Records the following year.

Inspired by H. G. Wells's novels The War of the Worlds and The First Men in the Moon, it follows the adventures of the eponymous scientist Doctor Omega and his companions in the spacecraft Cosmos. The first incarnation of the Doctor, as portrayed by William Hartnell in the long-running BBC science-fiction series Doctor Who bears a great resemblance to the illustrations of Doctor Omega, in the original publication. Overview The novel takes place in or around 1906, in an unidentified village in Normandy, then later takes the reader to Mars. The main protagonist, Doctor Omega, is the mysterious inventor of a projectile-shaped spacecraft dubbed Cosmos which can also function on land and under water. Cosmos is 13 meters long and 3 meters in diameter. It is made from a substance called or (depending on the edition) which repels space and time and enables it to travel in the aether. Its interior is divided into four sections, each lit by electric lights powered by a generator run by an eight-cylinder motor. The floors are all suspended upon universal joints in order to maintain a normal level. The portholes are made of transparent stellite. In addition to the bridge, the other sections of the ship include a storeroom, an armory, and the crew's sleeping quarters. Doctor Omega's companions in his travels are two Frenchmen: his neighbour Denis Borel (the narrator), and his worker, the hulkish Fred (no last name given). Doctor Omega and his two companions travel to Mars, where they first land in one of the Martian seas, where they perform some underwater exploration during which they encounter phosphorescent fish and aggressive reptilian mermen. Back on the surface they are attacked by savage dwarf-like beings with long, tentacled arms. Later, they explore the Red Valley in which bat-men have developed artificial wings to cohabit with deadly snakes. They meet another race of civilized macrocephalic gnomes, and are taken before their King, in the city of Fire. They learn to communicate with these Macrocephales, and help them in their war against their Southern enemies, the Cacocytes. The Macrocephales wish to keep Doctor Omega and his companions prisoners on Mars. Doctor Omega and his companions manage to broadcast an SOS however, and are then rescued by the equally mysterious Professor Helvetius. They eventually return to Earth, with the Martian Tiziraou. Editions The first edition was published by Librairie Mondiale in Paris, 1906, with illustrations by E. Bouard. The book was later reprinted under the title Les Chercheurs d'Inconnu: Aventures Fantastiques d'un Jeune Parisien (Seekers of the Unknown: The Fantastic Adventures of a Young Parisian) as a 12-issue pulp magazine by Tallandier, Paris, Nos. 1-9, 1908; Nos. 10-12, 1909. For that edition, Galopin changed the name of the ship to \\"Excelsior\\" and the substance to \\"stellite\\". He also rewrote and expanded several chapters and tried to appeal to a more juvenile audience. A reprint of the first edition was published by Albin Michel in 1949, with illustrations by Rapeno. In 2003, Los Angeles's Black Coat Press published an edition \\"adapted and retold\\" by Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier, with a cover by Gil Formosa. does not contain any illustrations; (Collector's Edition) contains a selection of illustrations by Bouard from the first edition. This edition is a free translation, or adaptation, of the first French edition. The credit adapted and retold was first coined by Philip Jos√© Farmer for his 1976 adaptation of the J.-H. Rosny novel Ironcastle. In this instance, some plot inconsistencies were removed or fixed; some scientific notions were updated or corrected; some racist or inappropriate language was deleted. Further, homages and references to the fictional characters Ars√®ne Lupin, Dr. Caresco, and Madeline were inserted. Additionally, references were added to imply that Doctor Omega was the Doctor from Doctor Who, mainly because of the coincidental - but real - similarities between the two characters (especially the First Doctor, played by William Hartnell from 1963-1966). Frequent Doctor Who writer Terrance Dicks provided a foreword, and the cover illustration was changed to one similar to the 1973 Target Books novelization of The Daleks. In 2009, French publisher Riviere Blanche reprinted the first edition, with selected illustrations from Bouard and Rapeno, a new foreword by Jean-Marc Lofficier, French translations of Terrance Dicks's foreword, and stories by Chris Roberson, Matthew Baugh, Travis Hiltz and Serge Lehman featuring Dr. Omega; cover by Gil Formosa. In 2011, the American publisher Black Cat Press printed an unabridged English translation with the original illustrations by E. Bouard. In 2014, Explore Multimedia released an unabridged four-disc English audiobook billed as \\"the possible origins of Doctor Who\\". Narrated by John Guilor, who supplied the voice of Hartnell's Doctor in episode \\"The Day of the Doctor\\"). In 2018, The student's publishers M√©li-M√©lo republished the book too. Other appearances Doctor Omega is mentioned and Tiziraou appears in a panel of The New Traveler's Almanac of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume II. Doctor Omega appears in several stories in the ongoing anthology Tales of the Shadowmen. A sequel volume, Doctor Omega and the Shadowmen collect the stories from the above collections, along with new ones. An additional sequel, a novel entitled Doctor Omega and the Electromen by David A.

Church and chapel There is a record of Foxham being a chapelry of the parish of Bremhill and Highway by 1219.Pugh & Crittall, 1953, pages 197-198 The present Church of England parish church of Saint John the Baptist was designed by the Gothic Revival architect William Butterfield and built in 1878-81. The church is Grade II* listed and has a stained glass window made in about 1855 that was part of the east window of St Martin's parish church, Bremhill. A Wesleyan chapel was built at Foxham in 1855, but it has been closed and converted into a house. Canal Construction of the Wilts & Berks Canal began at Semington in 1796 and had reached Foxham by December 1798, when Foxham locks were under construction.Small, 1999, page 20 By June 1800 the next section, from Foxham to Dauntsey, was complete,Small, 1999, page 21 and the canal was completed to Abingdon in September 1810.Small, 1999, page 24 The canal passed Foxham just east of Cadenham Manor, with two locks just north of the Foxham-Hilmarton road. It brought coal from the Somerset coalfield to Swindon and Abingdon. Traffic declined after the Great Western railway was completed in 1841 and was minimal by the end of the century, then ceased altogether in 1901 after the partial collapse of the aqueduct over the River Marden at Stanley, some south of Foxham.Small, 1999, page 94 The canal was formally abandoned by an Act of Parliament in 1914.Small, 1999, pages 95-96 The main line of the canal is now being restored.Small, 1999, pages 107-109 As of 2010, restoration of the section east of Foxham Top Lock was complete. Amenities Foxham has one public house, the Foxham Inn. The Reading Room was built in 1884 by the Lansdowne family and extended in 1979.

He formerly represented the South Australian House of Assembly seat of Finniss from the 2006 election to 2018, representing the Liberal Party.  Career  Pengilly is a resident of Victor Harbor, and first served as the mayor of Kangaroo Island as well as chairman of the SA Country Fire Service Board from 1995 to 2000. He was also the chairman of the Hills Mallee and Southern Regional Health Service Board for 8 years. The 2006 election saw Pengilly elected with a two-party margin of 6.5 percent, 9.1 percent less than under Dean Brown. Pengilly recovered 5.8 percent of the two- party vote at the 2010 election. He was elected mayor of Kangaroo Island for a second term in 2018.  Controversies  Pengilly controversially labelled Prime Minister Julia Gillard a \\"dog\\" on social media site Twitter on 24 November 2011, following her successful move to boost her government's numbers in House of Representatives by replacing Harry Jenkins as Speaker with Liberal National Party member Peter Slipper. That put Pengilly at risk of losing Liberal preselection for his seat of Finniss. In March the following year he remarked in Parliament that Transport Minister Chloe Fox \\"ought to be put down, fair dinkum\\" further jeopardising his preselection chances. The Fox comment was the latest in a series of at least four gaffes. Pengilly has also supported the prospect of seal culling in South Australia in defense of the interests of the fishing industry. In 2015 he said of the animals: > \\"Common sense dictates that where seals are way out of control and impacting > on fishing, the Government needs to take a common sense approach rather than > a foolish, do-nothing situation before (if it‚Äôs not happening already) > people take the law into their own hands and do it anyway... Seals are in > plague proportions, (and they) are not warm and cuddly, but highly invasive, > aggressive animals.‚Äù In 2015, Pengilly expressed his support for Oceanic Victor to establish an enterprise similar to Swim with Tuna (which was previously located near Port Lincoln) on and in waters adjacent Granite Island. Pengilly also praised the company's \\"transparency.\\" Oceanic Victor is directed by Tony Santic of Tony's Tuna International. Pengilly did not re-contest his seat at the 2018 election. Pengilly was elected mayor of the Kangaroo Island Council in November 2018, defeating incumbent Peter Clements.

The first part is relatively flat and the route passes through several villages which are Leigh Woods, Abbots Leigh, Easton in Gordano to Portishead. The road crosses the M5 motorway at Junction 19 which is where the single complex Gordano services are located. During the rush hour period the road gets extremely busy since it is the main commuter route from Portishead to Bristol. There is much congestion on the A369 which is why one of the primary reasons for reopening the Portishead Branch Line. History In 1922, the A369 was originally connected from Ashcott to Marksbury. By 1935 however, the road and became part of the A39, eventually the roads number became unused for many decades. By the 1950s, it was thought that Portishead was a connection to the A-road but it was connected to the B3124 and eventually it became part of the A369. The road crossed over the Clifton Suspension Bridge where soon after however, it was re-routed over the B3126 and connected to the A370. In the early 1970s, the M5 was completed from the Avonmouth Bridge and went southwards, the western half of the route became part of the Gordano Interchange. Eventually a new route was completed from the village of Portbury into Portishead, and the old road through Sheepway was separated by the M5 motorway so a new road called Wyndham Way was constructed to allow faster access to the Town Centre, Bristol Docks and Power Station.

While there were small groups hiding there occasionally since the embassy was opened in 1974, the number rose to several thousands in September, causing serious problems of supply and hygiene. Behind the scenes the West German government negotiated with East German authorities and the Soviet Union how to solve these worsening conditions. When Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher in the evening of 30 September stepped on the balcony to announce an agreement on the refugees' voyage to West Germany, the crowd cheered on the keyword Ausreise (departure). This event marked an emotional and significant moment in German history. Until 3 November when the East German authorities closed the border with Czechoslovakia, many more GDR citizens fled to the embassy in the following weeks, wearing down the patience of the Czechoslovak authorities which gave in eventually, letting all East Germans travel directly to West Germany. Thus, they broke their part of the Iron Curtain, the Czechoslovak border fortifications during the Cold War.

The film is based on the 2003 David Shrigley book of the same title. Kevin Eldon voices the role of the film's main character, Pete. The DVD was released in 2006 with a 12 page booklet with art from the film. Story Pete lives in the woods. He survives by hunting and killing. He is an outcast from society who finds happiness in being alone. He recalls the key moments that led him to turn his back on his hometown. Pete is in a state of denial about the past, drinking, mental illness and what happens when he does not take his medication is all one big laugh to him. History This quirky funny black and white animation was commissioned in 2004 by the animate! project. On completion it was given an 18 certificate by the British Board of Film Classification, a result which David Shrigley said he was proud of. David Shrigley and Chris Shepherd talked for several years about making a film. David Shrigley's 2003 book of the same title had a story which featured a narrative, a fictional autobiography which they realised was a perfect basis for a film. Who I am And What I Want was programmed alongside Farber's Nerve by Morgan Miller in the 2006 Manhattan Short Film Festival's world tour, which included 137 screenings across the US, Canada, the UK, and Europe. Both animations were in black and white. Quotes Pete: \\"My name is mushroom. My name is toadstool. My name is spore. My name is fungus. My name is mildew. My name is bog, fen, marsh and swamp. My name is truffle. My name is bacteria. My name is muck...but you can call me Pete.\\" Pete: \\"Everyone around here knows me...\\" Pete walks along the highstreet, he walks up to the bouncer of the Golden Nugget Bar. Pete: \\"Morning\\" Bouncer: \\"Fuck Off!\\" Pete: \\"I'm not allowed in the Golden Nugget...Not anymore. I don't know why I'm not allowed in there. I can't remember having done anything\\". Pete: \\"I want to feel you breathing upon me, and I want to be water-soluble so that when I go water skiing and fall off I will dissolve before the sharks can eat me\\". Pete: \\"I don't want to live with a herd of twats who are going to make me wear clothes and eat with a knife and fork.\\".

She is a graduate of the Company Directors Course and is a registered lobbyist with the State Government. Prior to election into politics, her education included a Certificate in Real Estate Sales, Political Studies undertaken by correspondence from Papua New Guinea through the University of Queensland, and was a Classified Teacher from the Wattle Park Teachers College, Adelaide. Penfold is a fellow of the Flinders University of South Australia Foundation Inc. and Member of the Eyre Peninsula Agricultural Research Foundation as well as Patron of the Lower Eyre Peninsula She has also been a member of many economic, marine and arts organisations, and has participated in hospital and health fundraising. Penfold won Liberal preselection for Flinders at the 1993 election. The seat had been held by National Peter Blacker since 1973. Blacker sat on a seemingly insurmountable margin of 10.9 percent. However, Penfold defeated him on a swing of 14.6 percent amid that year's massive Liberal landslide, taking 57.8 percent of the two-party vote. She actually won 54 percent of the primary vote, enough to win the seat outright. She defeated Blacker just as easily in a 1997 rematch. The 2006 election saw Penfold face a National candidate on the two party preferred vote. It was due to this that the Liberal vote collapsed from 18.3% to a margin of 10.1%. However the Liberal Labor margin was 78.6% making it the most conservative seat in the State. Penfold held Opposition portfolios of regional development, small business and consumer affairs. She did not contest the 2010 election. Former Australian Farmers' Federation Grains Council chairman Peter Treloar won the seat for the Liberals with a collapse in the National Party vote causing the two party preferred vote being between Liberal and Labor candidates.

At age 87, she was made a DBE (Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2014 New Year Honours List. The New London Theatre, where the original West End production of Cats played, was officially renamed the Gillian Lynne Theatre in 2018. This made Lynne the first non-royal woman to have a West End theatre named after her. Early life and education Gillian Barbara Pyrke was born in Bromley, Kent, and was a precocious dance talent from an early age, teaming with her childhood friend Beryl Grey while still at school, and dancing to blot out the tragedy of the violent death of her mother on 8 July 1939 in Coventry (as a result of a car crash along with Edward Turner's first wife), when Lynne was just 13 years old.Recounted by Dame Beryl Grey in The Independent, 10 March 2002; accessed 22 March 2014.Moorhead, Joanna. \\"'Mummy's still looking after me'\\" The Guardian, 25 November 2011; accessed 17 March 2014. Lynne's gift for dancing was discovered by a doctor. She had been underperforming at school, so her mother took her to the doctor and explained about her fidgeting and lack of focus. After hearing everything her mother said, the doctor told Lynne that he needed to talk to her mother privately for a moment. He turned on the radio and walked out. He then encouraged her mother to look at Lynne, who was dancing to the radio. The doctor noted that she was a dancer, and encouraged Lynne's mother to take her to dance school.Recounted by Sir Ken Robinson in his TED talk, Do schools kill creativity? (starting at 14:50 minutes) Dancing career =Sadler's Wells Ballet= While dancing for Molly Lake's Company at the People's Palace, Lynne was spotted by Ninette de Valois and asked to join Sadler's Wells Ballet during World War II.

The pale-footed bush warbler is found in the Himalayan region west from Deharadum through the foothills of Nepal to the Northeast India. This species is further found in Myanmar, Laos, northern Vietnam and southern China. A single sight was recorded from Kandy, Sri Lanka in March 1993. Taxonomy and systematics =Subspecies= There are three subspecies of pale-footed bush warbler *U. p. pallidipes *U. p. osmastoni *U. p. laurentei Call of Pale-footed Bush Warbler Sonogram of Pale-footed bush warbler  Distribution and Habitat The pale- footed bush warbler usually associates with Themeda grasslands. The habitat and altitudinal limit for pale-footed bush warbler slightly vary from place to place. For example, in Thailand, its habitat is known as grassland and scrub from foothills up to 1800 m. In China, its habitat is known as woodland up to 1525 m. =Nepal= The pale-footed bush warbler is a resident bird for Nepal. It is mostly found in Chitwan. This species as well as other species of the birds in Nepal are threatened due to habitat loss and population decline in Nepal. =India= Urosphena pallidipes was first described in The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma Vol.2, by William Thomas Blanford and Eugene W. Oates in the year 1874. In peninsular India the pale-footed bush warbler U. p. pallidipes has been reported as breeding in the Eastern Ghats by Salim Ali and Sidney Dillon Ripley. They collected a specimen from Sunkarametta, Araku Valley, Vishakapatnam district (altitude of 1000m) in the month of April A male adult of the subspecies U. p. osmastoni was first described from Andaman Islands (altitude 730m) by Ernst Hartert. Nest-building in U. p. osmastoni was described by Bertram Beresford Osmaston in the year 1907 Subspecies U. p. pallidipes has also been reported from Simlipal Tiger Reserve, Simlipal National Park Odisha (altitude 600-1500m) in December 2012 from a grassland near a Sal forest Ecology and behavior The pale-footed bush warbler is extremely shy and is a great skulker, meaning it is very difficult to see even during the breeding season. This species breeds from May to July. The bird is usually found either by itself or in pairs in low bushes and grass clumps. It is also known as lowland species. It likes to stay close to ground; thus, it flies less than a meter high above ground. It moves through grass reeds keeping it low, staying mostly out of sight. It feeds on the lower half of grass reeds. =Vocalization= The pale-footed bush warbler has a loud song. Because the pale-footed bush warbler stays in the lower part of its habitat, it is more easily heard than seen. This species remains mostly silent during winter but its call and song can be easily heard during spring. Its explosive song is the best way to signal its species.

Pederick currently holds title of the Government Whip in the South Australian House of Assembly. Pederick won Hammond from Liberal-turned-independent Peter Lewis who left to contest a seat in the Upper House. Previous to his election in to politics, Pederick managed a family dryland and grazing enterprise property at Coomandook for the past 14 years and is a supporter of local and regional community causes and events. The 2006 election saw Pederick elected with a 12.0-point margin. He was reelected for a third consecutive term in the 2014 election.  Parliamentary career  = Fracking = In September 2013, Pederick told the South Australian Parliament that he had been involved with fracking 'thirty years ago' in the Cooper Basin in South Australia. He said \\"When I was involved and worked for Gearheart Australia and we were shooting wells in 1983 and 1984, we worked alongside Halliburton to complete those jobs.\\" He went on to describe the process of fracking as he had witnessed it at the time, before discussing water issues: > \\"There is a lot of concern, obviously, about possible contamination‚Äîwhether > it is groundwater contamination or freshwater contamination‚Äîand the last > thing oil companies want (the last thing anyone wants) is shooting off site > because when you are shooting oil and gas, you do not want to shoot water... > There has been a lot of emotion, and I concur with the member for Waite's > comments that, yes, we do need to get on with the job, we do need to be > careful, and we do need to make sure we have the appropriate environmental > management and the appropriate water management. But I can assure you‚Äîand I > know very much from experience‚Äîthe last thing people want to do is make a > mistake in these jobs.\\" He concluded his presentation by supporting the expansion of the practise in South Australia by saying: > \\"We do have to make sure that the process is operated effectively and we > certainly cannot have a process where hydraulic fracturing is taken out of > the equation, because it is certainly a big part of making sure that the > economy of this state gets going.\\" In June 2015, Pederick went on a fracking fact-finding trip to the US with fellow South Australian politicians Troy Bell, Mark Parnell and John Darley, and farmer David Smith. = Seal culling = Arctocephalus forsteri - New Zealand fur seal Pederick has advocated for the seal culling in South Australia. Arctocephalus forsteri, which is native to South Australia is protected as a marine mammal listed under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1973. In 2012 he called for the animals to be sterilised on Kangaroo Island, where he believed that they were impacting little penguin populations. In 2015 he claimed that the animals were in Lake Albert, Lake Alexandrina and the Coorong, where they were causing \\"distress in the environment but also major distress to the fishing industry.\\" He has suggested a \\"sustainable harvest\\" of the species, with potential opportunities for the complementary use of scare tactics. He has also suggested that local abattoirs could potentially process seal meat. He has referred the species as \\"rats of the sea\\" and claimed that the animals have attacked fishermen's nets and damaged them. He told The Victor Harbor Times that \\"they kill fish, and cost thousands of dollars in lost production of fish and in lost sales due to damage.\\" He told ABC: > \\"They're eating in just three days the equivalent of the whole lakes and > Coorong fishery allocation for one year and people down there, as far as the > fishing side of it, are having trouble paying their licence fees, there's > people looking at exiting the industry because they can't see any future so > it's having a massive impact.\\" Pederick also commented on an incident in which a seal was hit and killed during a watersport event. He told PowerFM: > \\"As we saw with the speed ski titles in Murray Bridge in early June, the > titles had to be pulled up because sadly a fur seal was hit by a boat. If > those seals keep invading the river like that what is the government going > to do? Are they going to decide to stop all recreational boating on the > river? That would be a half a billion dollar impact to the South Australian > River Murray system right throughout.\\" Pederick has said that he has the backing of his Liberal colleagues with respect to the 'humane' culling of fur seals in South Australia. = Finn's Law = In August 2014 Pederick introduced a law that would allow the opportunity for foster carers to be recognised on death certificates of children who die while in their care, and be involved in their funeral arrangements. Pederick designed the law after meeting one of his constituents, Monica Perrett, who was denied any information about her foster son Finn's death as she was not the biological mother. Attorney-General John Rau said the Government would consider the Bill, but noted that it was a complex area of law.

He is mainly remembered as the designer of the Bugatti Model 100 racing aircraft. Career He was interested in aircraft from his childhood and by 1907 had begun to explore ways of automatically stabilizing aircraft. These studies culminated in 1914 with the construction of such a machine, which flew successfully in turbulent conditions on 15 June 1914. In 1915 he produced another autostabilized aircraft, a biplane with a propeller in the centre of its fuselage. During World War I he was granted patents for methods of in-flight disposal of burning fuel, of metal propellers and for bomb releases. Towards the end of the war he flew with the Belgian Air Force and completed a series of calculations over propeller efficiency. The rights to use these designs was bought by La Maison Lumi√®re and at the end of the war de Monge helped to set up S.A. Establissements Lumi√®re and became its Administrator-Delegate. The company employed S√©bastienne Guyot, an early woman aeronautical engineer. It was in their workshops that his first post-war aircraft, the Lumi√®re-de Monge racer, sometimes referred to as the Lumi√®re-de Monge 5/1. de Monge was then hired by Buscaylet P√®re et Fils-Bobin, building a fighter version of the racer, the Buscaylet-de Monge 5/2. Later, he designed twin-engined, twin boomed, lifting body aircraft with the experimental Buscaylet-de Monge 7-4 and its development the 7-5 as small scale aerodynamic models of the proposed, three times larger, de Monge 72. The rights to these were acquired by Bordeaux shipbuilders Dyle et Bacalan who wanted to develop transatlantic airliners from them. They built a series of military prototypes, starting with the Dyle et Bacalan DB-10 heavy bomber of 1926. In 1925, de Monge joined car and motorcycle makers Imp√©ria at Li√®ge as chief research engineer. Some of his work there included torsion bar suspension and automatic transmissions. de Monge left Imp√©ria in 1937 to join Ettore Bugatti, where he designed the Bugatti Model 100 racing aircraft. This had been almost completed in Paris in 1940 but when France was occupied by Germany it was moved to the French countryside, where it was hidden for the next thirty years. It eventually went to the US and is now in the EAA AirVenture Museum.

Her father, Gunnar Hoffsten, was also a musician and played the trumpet in a jazz band. From her first recordings, Hoffsten's music and stage act have weaved together rock, folk and blues influences, while sometimes moving into R'n'B and jazz territory, unified by her earthy, slightly operatic singing style and driving, lean grooves. Like many blues singers she plays the harmonica as well, a recurrent element in her songs; she is arguably the most well-known and recognized female blues singer of contemporary Sweden. She has built a wide following in her native land, has won several awards and currently resides in Stockholm. She participated in Melodifestivalen 2013 with the song \\"Only the Dead Fish Follow the Stream\\". Four songs from her sixth studio album 6 (1995), \\"Dance On Your Grave\\", \\"Box Full Of Faces\\", \\"Miracle\\", and \\"Nice Doin' Business\\", were featured on the American primetime soap opera Melrose Place. In 1999, American country artist Faith Hill recorded a cover of Hoffsten's \\"Bringing Out The Elvis\\", which Hill included on her album Breathe, one of the best-selling country albums of all time. In 1996, Louise was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, but despite the complications and occasional depressions (mirrored in the book/record Blues), she continues to write, tour and perform music. On January 21, 2015, she released her second book En n√§ve grus (a fist of gravel), which was co-written by Lena Katarina Swanberg.

Biography Godunov's most influential work is in the area of applied and numerical mathematics, particularly in the development of methodologies used in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and other computational fields. Godunov's theorem (Godunov, 1959) (also known as Godunov's order barrier theorem) : Linear numerical schemes for solving partial differential equations, having the property of not generating new extrema (a monotone scheme), can be at most first-order accurate. Godunov's scheme is a conservative numerical scheme for solving partial differential equations. In this method, the conservative variables are considered as piecewise constant over the mesh cells at each time step and the time evolution is determined by the exact solution of the Riemann (shock tube) problem at the inter-cell boundaries (Hirsch, 1990). On 1‚Äì2 May 1997 a symposium entitled: Godunov-type numerical methods, was held at the University of Michigan to honour Godunov. These methods are widely used to compute continuum processes dominated by wave propagation. On the following day, 3 May, Godunov received an honorary degree from the University of Michigan.

Its origins at the intersection of two culinary worlds is reflected in its synthesis of salt-curing and smoking. The first historical mention of Tyrolean Speck was in the early 13th century when some of the current production techniques were already in use. S√ºdtiroler Speck () is now a protected geographic designation with PGI status. Curing Like prosciutto and other hams and most German Speck, Tyrolean speck is made from the hind leg of the pig. It is deboned before curing. A leg of pork is deboned and divided into large sections called \\"baffe\\", and then cured in salt and one of various spice combinations, which may include garlic, bay leaves, juniper berries, nutmeg, and other spices, and then rested for a period of several weeks. After this, the smoking process begins. Tyrolean Speck is cold-smoked slowly and intermittently for two or three hours a day for a period of roughly a week using woods such as beech at temperatures that never exceed 20¬∞C (68¬∞F). It is then matured for five months. Uses Tissue-thin slices of speck can also be served with horseradish, pickles and dark rye bread. Typically appearing in alongside hearty whole-grain breads, Tyrolean speck can also be seen in the company of shellfish, sometimes wrapped around scallops or rolled about breadsticks and served with lobster salad. Speck can be cut into thick strips and added to pasta sauces or any dish beginning with a soffritto of olive oil and chopped vegetables. In dishes like risotto, the extremely strong flavour of Tyrolean speck can usually be cut with light flavours such as parsley, lemon, mint, etc. In salads, Tyrolean speck pairs well with apples, sprouts, mushrooms, and hearts of celery. In Italy, speck is most often paired with radicchio as a topping for pizzas, or a condiment for pastas or risotto. This reflects the germano-venetic culture common in the extreme north east. Tyrolean speck can easily replace bacon or as a smoky alternative to Pancetta. The differences between Tyrolean speck and bacon include different time lengths of smoking, the technique of curing it, and the fact that Tyrolean speck cures for a longer period of time than bacon does.

According to Humanists International, the day is a way of spreading awareness of Humanism as a philosophical life stance and means to effect change in the world. IHEU official site It is also seen as a time for Humanists to gather socially and promote the positive values of Humanism.  History  The holiday developed during the 1980s as several chapters of the American Humanist Association (AHA) began to celebrate it. At the time, the date on which it was celebrated varied from chapter to chapter, with selections such as the founding date of the IHEU, or other significant dates. From the late 1980s to the early 1990s, the AHA and IHEU passed resolutions declaring World Humanist Day to be on the northern summer solstice.  Format and Activities  The manner in which World Humanist Day is celebrated varies considerably among local Humanist groups, reflecting the individuality and non-dogmatism of Humanism as a whole. Whilst the event might be a simple gathering, such as a dinner or picnic, with ample time for both socialising and reflection, the method of celebration is down to the individual Humanists. Some groups actually develop intricate social rituals, music, and proceedings which highlight the metaphoric symbolism of the solstice and the light (knowledge) which brings us out of darkness (ignorance).  Today  World Humanist Day is a holiday in many Humanist organizations; many of them recognize it and plan events and activities around the holiday. Humanists International lists several different ways that national and local Humanist groups celebrate World Humanist Day. For example, the Dutch Humanist Association broadcast short films about World Humanist Day on Dutch TV in 2012. In 2013, the first National Humanist Day will be organized in The Netherlands. The Humanist Association of Ireland held poetry readings in the park to celebrate the day.

His performances in both 1960 and 1961 were instrumental in making his sire Aureole the Leading sire in Great Britain & Ireland both years. St. Paddy was the winner of the 1960 Epsom Derby and St. Leger Stakes. Background Owned and bred by Sir Victor Sassoon, he was out of the mare Edie Kelly and sired by Aureole, a winner of the Coronation Cup and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. Edie Kelly, who ran 14 times winning one small apprentice handicap, later produced Parmeila, a filly who won the Ribblesdale Stakes and the Park Hill Stakes in 1970. St. Paddy's grandsire, Hyperion, and his damsire, Bois Roussel, both won The Derby. St. Paddy was bred and raised at his owner's Thornton Stud, Thornton-le-Street, North Yorkshire. Racing career =1959:two-year-old season= St. Paddy finished unplaced on his debut in the Acomb Stakes at York in August. In September he won the Royal Lodge Stakes at Ascot. =1960:three-year-old season= On 27 April St. Paddy finished unplaced behind Martial in the 2000 Guineas on his seasonal debut. He then won the Dante Stakes at York in May. In the Derby on 1 June at Epsom he was ridden by Lester Piggott and started at odds of 7/1. The race was run in warm, sunny weather and attracted the customary huge crowd which included the Queen. He was prominent from the start, took the lead three furlongs from the finish and was never in danger, winning easily by three lengths from Alcaeus with Kythnos third. The race was marred by a fatal injury sustained by the favourite Angers. He was narrowly beaten in the Gordon Stakes by Kipling, to whom he was conceding five pounds. he then won the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York in August. In the St Leger at Doncaster in September he stated odds-on favourite against eight rivals and won easily by three lengths from Die Hard. =1961: four-year-old season= St. Paddy won the Coombe Stakes at Sandown, the Hardwicke Stakes at Royal Ascot and the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown in July. In the Eclipse he led from the start and won impressively from Proud Chieftain, leading the Glasgow Herald to describe him as \\"the complete racehorse\\". He started favourite for the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot one week later but was beaten three lengths into second place by the Prix du Jockey Club winner Right Royal. In Autumn, St. Paddy won the Jockey Club Stakes, but was beaten in the Champion Stakes. His defeat meant that he failed to break the record for prize money by a British-trained horse, his final total of $272,141 placing him second behind Ballymoss. He was then retired to stud. Stud Record St. Paddy was retired after the 1961 racing season to stand at stud at Beech House Stud in Newmarket. As a sire, he met with reasonable success, notably siring Connaught, winner of the Eclipse Stakes and Jupiter Island, a multiple graded stakes race winner whose biggest success came in the 1986 Japan Cup. St. Paddy was pensioned in 1981 and died in 1984 at the age of twenty-seven. He is buried at Beech House Stud.

Since yukhoe uses raw beef, freshness is the most important criterion, and for this typical dish's beef it is recommended to use no more than one day after defrosting, and traditionally should not be aged more than one day after slaughtering. Regular Korean yukhoe customers are often patrons of trusted restaurants or butcher's shops which have well-known, high-quality beef distributors.KAPE.HACCP Since 2004, the Korean Government has run the Beef Traceability System.https://web.archive.org/web/20090220203853/http://www.mtrace.go.kr/ This system requires ID numbers with the age of the beef animal of origin, supplier, distributor, the beef's grade, and butchering date and originating butchery. Most of the good beef restaurants in Korea list their beef's information on the wall. Also, butcher shops post signs saying, \\"new beef coming day\\" ( so deureoyoneun nal): these words have become a well-known idiom in Korea.\\"New Korean beef coming day\\" Launched by GS shop. and it means newly butchered beef supplied at the day.
