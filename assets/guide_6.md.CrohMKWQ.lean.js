He was a Clann na Poblachta member of Seanad Éireann from 1951 to 1954. Until the 1940s, Hartnett was Junior Counsel to former IRA Chief of Staff Seán MacBride in a number of defences of IRA prisoners. In 1946, the pair represented the deceased hunger-striker Seán McCaughey at an inquest into his death, which embarrassed the government of Éamon de Valera by exposing the poor conditions at Portlaoise Prison. Hartnett - whose family were all supporters of de Valera and the Fianna Fáil party he founded - was then dismissed from his position at Radio Éireann, the Irish broadcasting company, under the influence of de Valera. Hartnett left Fianna Faíl soon after and joined Clann na Poblachta, the new political party founded by MacBride. In 1947, MacBride became a Teachta Dála (TD) for Dublin County in the 1947 by- election. De Valera then sought to outwit his opponents with a snap election in 1948. Because of his political experience, MacBride chose Hartnett as his director of elections. He narrated and appeared in Ireland's first political campaigning film, for Clann na Poblachta, called \\"Our Country\\". After the new party won ten seats, it formed part of the first Inter-Party Government, ousting Fianna Fáil from their long tenure as the party of government. Hartnett had failed to win the seat for the Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown constituency, though there remained the possibility of appointment to the Seanad Éireann. However, he was bitterly hurt to be overlooked by Seán MacBride to be party spokesman in the Seanad. After a bill to fund a new Irish News Agency (with an anti-partition slant) was passed in 1949, MacBride's initial choice for head of the Agency was Hartnett but after a row with him he asked Conor Cruise O'Brien instead, a man who referred to Hartnett as \\"a dedicated republican propagandist.\\" Hartnett ended up on the board of the Agency. MacBride also took Hartnett with him as a speech-writer on a trip to the USA, to pen the rousing, sentimental, republican message for the local audience; Hartnett was sent home half-way through, initially explaining that MacBride considered the words of his speech too aggressive. Eventually, because of MacBride's failure to act regarding a case of political cronyism concerning James Everett, Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in the Baltinglass affair, he provided a resignation letter for MacBride in February 1951. In the subsequent election of 1951 he was Noël Browne's director of elections - with Browne running as an independent - and he threatened legal action against some clerics of the Catholic Church who had cast Browne, in his support of free healthcare, either as communist or Nazi. It was arranged that same year for Hartnett to see a consultant cardiologist because of his ill health, and he was given a poor prognosis. Notwithstanding this, he continued in politics and was elected by the Labour Panel to the 7th Seanad, representing Clann na Poblachta. He lost his seat at the 1954 Seanad election. In June 1958, he failed in his second attempt to become a TD, this time representing the National Progressive Democrats in the Dublin South-Central constituency by- election.

Earl Guinn (August 21, 1912 - June 7, 2004), was from 1951 to 1975 the fifth president of Southern Baptist-affiliated Louisiana College in Pineville, Louisiana. Background Guinn was the youngest of six children of Mr. and Mrs. John Guinn; his father (1872-1920) was born and died in Polk County, Tennessee. Guinn graduated from LC in 1937 and was the first LC president to have been an alumnus of the institution. He obtained his doctorate from New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary. Prior to his appointment as the LC president in the summer of 1951, Guinn had been a pastor in several Southern Baptist churches, including First Baptist in Bossier City, Louisiana, and had been an associate professor of theology at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas.\\"Dr. Guinn Will Preach Sunday\\", Minden Herald, July 23, 1948, p. 1\\"Guinn to speak at Arcadia\\", Minden Press-Herald, November 18, 1977, p. 5A LC president Guinn launched the first construction program since the founding of Louisiana College in 1906. In 1953, Simon W. Tudor of Pineville donated twenty-seven acres of additional land to the college. Projects completed under Guinn were the Warner Cottage and the Morgan Walker Student Center (since the Hixson Center), named for Morgan W. Walker Sr., the founder of what became Continental Trailways. A two-story presidents house was constructed in 1956; it is now the Robert L. and Bonnie Lynn Alumni and Development Center named for Guinn's successor as president, Robert L. Lynn and Lynn's wife, Dr. Bonnie Moore Lynn. Other buildings added during Guinn's period as president were the Richard W. Norton Memorial Library, Tudor Hall, Weathersby Fine Arts Building, H.O. West Physical Education Building, and twenty student apartments. To raise money for a science center, religious education building, and auditorium, Guinn launched a $2 million fundraising operation through the Louisiana Baptist Convention, the first statewide campaign in the history of Southern Baptists to raise funds for Christian higher education. LC football, first played in 1907, was discontinued in 1969. The Guinn Religious Education Center, completed in 1973, is named in his honor. It contains classroom space for the religion department, the 300-seat Frances S. Bolton Chapel, and the 1,800-seat Guinn Auditorium, where student assemblies are held. The facility houses the Gladys Tatum West Pipe Organ, a 185-rank, five-manual Moeller organ, among the largest such instruments in the South.Frances Sample Bolton and Gladys Tatum West were the wives of LC benefactors James C. Bolton, a banker from Alexandria, and H. O. West, a department store owner from Minden and the donor of the athletic building. The Dr. G. Earl Guinn Endowed Forensic Scholarship is awarded to a student in the debate squad. Thus far, Guinn is the second longest-serving LC president, topped by Claybrook Cottingham, the president from 1910 to 1941, who thereafter headed Louisiana Tech University until his accidental death in 1949. Guinn's successor, Robert L. Lynn, served twenty-two years from 1975 to 1997. In retirement, Guin spoke against the conservative resurgence, which began in 1979 in the Southern Baptist Convention. In a 2001 address to a group called \\"Mainstream Southern Baptists\\", he claimed that church donations had declined under conservative control and proclaimed: > ...The human hunger for freedom cannot be suppressed forever. This > insistence on liberty has been at the heart of the Baptist movement from its > inception. ...

The film was written, produced, and directed by Robert Bilheimer, who had been asked to make the film by Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Bilheimer planned Not My Life as the second installment in a trilogy, the first being A Closer Walk and the third being the unproduced Take Me Home. The title Not My Life came from a June 2009 interview with Molly Melching, founder of Tostan, who said that many people deny the reality of contemporary slavery because it is an uncomfortable truth, saying, \\"No, this is not my life.\\" Filming of Not My Life took four years to complete, and documented human trafficking in 13 countries: Albania, Brazil, Cambodia, Egypt, Ghana, Guatemala, India, Italy, Nepal, Romania, Senegal, Uganda, and the United States. The first and last scenes of the film take place in Ghana, and show children who are forced to fish in Lake Volta for 14 hours a day. The film also depicts sex trafficking victims, some of whom are only five or six years old. Fifty people are interviewed in the film, including investigative journalist Paul Radu of Bucharest, Katherine Chon of the Polaris Project, and Iana Matei of Reaching Out Romania. Don Brewster of Agape International Missions says that all of the girls they have rescued from child sex tourism in Cambodia identify Americans as the clients who were the most abusive to them. The film was dedicated to Richard Young, its cinematographer and co- director, after he died in December 2010. It had its premiere the following month at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City. The narration was completely rerecorded in 2011, replacing Ashley Judd's voice with that of Glenn Close. The version of the film that was aired by CNN International as part of the CNN Freedom Project was shorter than the version shown at the premiere. In 2014, a re-edited version of the film was released. Not My Life addresses many forms of slavery, including the military use of children in Uganda, involuntary servitude in the United States, forced begging and garbage picking in India, sex trafficking in Europe and Southeast Asia, and other kinds of child abuse. The film also focuses on the people and organizations engaged in working against human trafficking. The film asserts that most victims of human trafficking are children. Actress Lucy Liu said that people who watch Not My Life \\"will be shocked to find [human trafficking] is happening in America.\\" Lucy Popescu of CineVue criticized the film for focusing on the victims, arguing that the perpetrators of trafficking should have been dealt with more prominently. Not My Life was named Best World Documentary at the Harlem International Film Festival in September 2012. Themes Not My Life is a documentary film about human trafficking and contemporary slavery. It addresses many forms of slavery, including the military use of children in Uganda, involuntary servitude in the United States, unfree labor in Ghana, forced begging and garbage picking in India, sex trafficking in Europe and Southeast Asia, and other kinds of child abuse. The focus of the film is on trafficking victims, especially women and children, the latter of whom are often betrayed by adults that they trust. The film also focuses on the people and organizations engaged in working against human trafficking, including members of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Free the Slaves, Girls Educational and Mentoring Services (GEMS), International Justice Mission (IJM), the Somaly Mam Foundation, Terre des hommes, Tostan, UNICEF, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), and the United States Department of State (US DoS). Not My Life has been called \\"a cautionary tale\\". It depicts the commodification of millions of people and identifies the practices of traffickers as undermining international economics, security, sustainability and health. A boy begging in India. Not My Life depicts many different kinds of contemporary slavery, including forced child begging. Not My Life calls attention to the fact that, in the United States, the sentencing for human trafficking is less severe than for drug trafficking. The film indicates a relationship between contemporary slavery and globalization. It asserts that most human trafficking victims are children, although the filmmakers have recognized the fact that millions of adults are also trafficked. The film depicts human trafficking as a matter of good and evil, provides interviews with survivors of human trafficking, and presents analysis from anti-trafficking advocates. Throughout the film, Robert Bilheimer encourages viewers to personally combat human trafficking. Bilheimer was sparing in his use of statistics in the film, feeling that overloading viewers with figures might numb them to the issues. According to Nancy Keefe Rhodes of Stone Canoe, a U.S. literary journal, the film's audiences are likely to have the preconception that human trafficking is not slavery in the same sense that the Atlantic slave trade was, and many people believe that slavery was abolished a long time ago with such instruments as the U.S. Emancipation Proclamation and Thirteenth Amendment. Rhodes writes that society now uses the word \\"slavery\\" in modern contexts only as a metaphor, so that references to actual contemporary slavery can be dismissed as hyperbole,Rhodes, p. 13. and she describes the film's goal as to \\"reclaim the original term [slavery] and convince us that what is happening now is what happened then: highly organized and pervasive, intentional, highly profitable and ... fully as coercive and wantonly cruel.\\" Rhodes says that the word \\"slavery\\" has started to be used in its original sense again in recent years, but that audiences' views on contemporary slavery are nonetheless influenced by the slave-like imagery in such films as Hustle & Flow (2005) and Black Snake Moan (2007). The Academy Award-winning Hustle & Flow portrays a pimp as the hero, while Black Snake Moan features Christina Ricci as a young nymphomaniac; the marketing for Black Snake Moan centered on evocative, sexualized slave imagery, including a scantily-clad Ricci in chains.Rhodes, p. 12. According to Rhodes, Bilheimer \\"rescue[s] modern slaves from representation as exotic creatures, to restore their humanity\\" and allow audiences to relate to them. For this purpose, Bilheimer tells stories of individuals in the context of their communities and families.Rhodes, p. 14. While Bilheimer had previously done extensive social justice work with religious organizations, he did not proselytize in the film, despite the many opportunities the film afforded him to do so.Rhodes, p. 16.

Not My Life begins with a black screen on which the words \\"Human trafficking is slavery\\" appear in white.Rhodes, p. 1. A sequence filmed in Ghana follows, showing children who are forced to fish in Lake Volta for 14 hours a day. Many of the children die as a result of the working conditions. A 10-year-old boy swims through the murky water towards the camera, looking into it, and holds his breath underwater while trying to unsnarl a fishing net. Next, Senegalese talibes, Muslim boys who attend Quranic schools, appear. There are approximately 50,000 talibes in Senegal who are forced to beg on the streets to make money for their teachers; children who do not meet their quotas are beaten. Many of these children suffer from skin and stomach diseases because of their diet of spoiled food—one demonstrates his diseased hands to the camera, only for an adult to pull him away by the ear. The film then moves to India and depicts children, mostly wearing flip-flops, illegally sorting through hazardous waste in GhazipurRhodes, p. 4. and New Delhi landfills. Romani families are shown in Central and Eastern Europe, and the narration indicates that Romani boys are often trafficked for the purpose of forced child begging, and that Romani girls are regularly trafficked as child prostitutes. The narrator says that the profits of human trafficking \\"are built on the backs and in the beds of our planet's youth.\\" In Zoha Prison in Romania, there are interviews with traffickers serving prison sentences that the film suggested were too short in light of the severity of the crime of human trafficking. The typical sentence for this crime is six or seven years, while the sentence for trafficking in drugs is normally twenty years. Two Romanian traffickers, Traian and Ovidiu, attest to having starved, punched, and kicked the girls they trafficked. Ovidiu recounts a story, in an interview filmed in February 2007, about kidnapping a prostitute and selling her for sex when he was 14. He expresses no remorse for these actions. The sentences served by Traian and Ovidiu were short enough that, by the time the film was released, they were no longer in prison. Ana, a girl they trafficked, is also interviewed in the film, saying that she lost a tooth in one of her beatings. She describes being pregnant at the time, but not telling this to her captors because of fears for the unborn child's safety. Romanian investigative journalist Paul Radu (left) being interviewed by Richard Young (center) and Robert Bilheimer (right). Radu is one of fifty people interviewed in Not My Life. Radu is interviewed in this portion of the film, as is Tournecuillert, who speaks about his experiences in Albania, where he heard about the sex trafficking of girls and how some of the girls would be shot or burned to death as a warning to the other girls. He describes how Albanian girls are often rounded up to be sexually trafficked in Italy. He further explains that, normally, before they leave Albania, the traffickers kill one of the girls in front of the others—usually by burning or shooting—to demonstrate what will happen to others who try to escape. Matei adds that, for the sake of amusement, some of the girls would be buried alive with only their heads remaining above ground. Eugenia Bonetti, a nun, speaks about her work helping girls escape from slavery in Italy.Rhodes, p. 15. Another interview is with a Wichita, Kansas woman named Angie who was prostituted with another girl, Melissa, in the American MidwestRhodes, p. 8. when they were teenagers. Angie recounts how they were expected to have sex with truck drivers and steal their money. She describes an incident when, after Melissa found pictures of a man's grandchildren in his wallet, they realized he was old enough to be their own grandfather. \\"I wanted to die,\\" she says, close to tears. Outside the film, Bilheimer said that Angie's trafficker expected her to engage in forty sex acts a night, and threatened to kill her if she refused. \\"It's not just truck drivers,\\" FBI agent Mike Beaver says. \\"We're seeing them purchased and abused by both white collar and blue collar individuals.\\" This statement segues into a Washington, D.C., scene wherein two girls in their early teens are shown by a curb on K Street, changing into prostitutes' attire. Angie was rescued during Operation Stormy Nights, an anti-human-trafficking operation carried out by the FBI, in 2004. Bilheimer said that, while there is no way of being certain how many girls like Angie are being sexually trafficked in the U.S., \\"diligent people out there have arrived at a bare minimum figure of ... one hundred thousand girls, eight to fifteen [performing] ten sex acts a day\\" adding up to \\"a billion unpunished crimes of sexual violence on an annual basis.\\"Rhodes, p. 46. U.S. President Barack Obama, telling the story of American sex trafficking victim Sheila White during a speech to the Clinton Global Initiative. White is interviewed in Not My Life. Another American victim of sexual trafficking, Sheila White, describes an incident in 2003 when she was beaten up next to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. She says that nobody even asked her if she needed help. White eventually escaped from being trafficked and went on to work with GEMS to raise awareness on the issue in New York. In 2012, after the film was released, Barack Obama, President of the United States, recognized White's work and told her story during a speech to the Clinton Global Initiative. The next scenes in the film depict child labour in Nepal, and indicate that child workers in the textile industry are commonly targeted by sex traffickers. A brothel raid in India, led by Balkrishna Acharya of the Rescue Foundation in Mumbai, is then shown. Ten young girls are rescued from a four-by-three-foot closet and a crawl space. The madam reacts furiously, perceiving the raid as taking away her livelihood. Then, the trafficking of children into the sex industry is depicted in Cambodia. Some scenes take place in Svay Pak, Phnom Penh, one of the cheapest sex tourism destinations in the Mekong Delta. Women of the Somaly Mam Foundation are depicted working with girls who have been sexually trafficked. A large number of these girls are pictured one by one, each child fading into the next against the backdrop of a doorway. An interview with one of the Somaly Mam Foundation workers, Sophea Chhun, reveals that her daughter, Sokny, was kidnapped in 2008 at age 23.Rhodes, p. 9. \\"Most likely Sokny too was sold,\\" Chhun says, claiming that \\"the police treated it like she wasn't important\\"—perhaps, she suggests, because Sokny was an adopted child.Rhodes, p. 10. Don Brewster of Agape International Missions is interviewed, and says that all of the girls they have rescued from child sex tourism in Cambodia identify Americans as the clients who were the most abusive to them.Rhodes, p. 5. Bilheimer agreed with this assertion in an interview outside the film. Gary Haugen (left), president of International Justice Mission, receiving an award from Hillary Clinton recognizing him as a Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Hero. Haugen appears in Not My Life. In Guatemala City, Guatemalan trafficker Efrain Ortiz is shown being arrested, and the film indicates that he was later given a prison sentence of 95 years. Ortiz had two sons he had been using for waste collection and five daughters he had been committing incest with. Bilheimer accompanies IJM representatives Pablo Villeda, Amy Roth, and Gary Haugen as they and the local police arrest Ortiz; he is charged with exploitation of children and violence against women. Ortiz looks surprised as he is handcuffed. Haugen, President of IJM, went on to be named a Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Hero in the 2012 US DoS TIP Report. Grace Akallo, a Ugandan woman who was once abducted by Joseph Kony to be used as a child soldier in the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), is interviewed, saying that \\"this kind of evil must be stopped.\\" She was forced to kill another girl as part of her initiation into the LRA, a very common practice among armies that employ child soldiers. The film states that she was ultimately rehabilitated and became a mother. Bishop Desmond Tutu, who Bilheimer had previously interviewed for The Cry of Reason, appears towards the end of the film, saying, \\"Each of us has the capacity to be a saint.\\"Rhodes, p. 3. Bilheimer included Tutu in Not My Life because he felt that audiences might be in need of pastoral counseling after watching the film. The final scene of Not My Life returns to the boy holding his breath underwater in Ghana. His name is revealed to be Etse, and it is stated that he and six other trafficking victims shown in the film have been rescued. Some of the last words in the film are spoken by Brazilian human rights advocate Leo Sakomoto: \\"I can't see a good life while there are people living like animals. Not because I'm a good person, not because it's my duty, but because they are human—like me.\\" Production =Background= Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, asked Robert Bilheimer to make Not My Life. The project that became Not My Life was initiated by the executive director of the UNODC, Antonio Maria Costa, who wanted to commission a film that would \\"bring the issue of modern slavery to the attention of public opinion, globally—especially the well-meaning, law- abiding and God-fearing people who do not believe something so horrible is happening in their own neighborhood.\\" With this goal in mind, Costa approached Worldwide Documentaries, an East Bloomfield, New York-based organization that had produced two films with which he was familiar: The Cry of Reason, which documents internal resistance to South African apartheid by way of Beyers Naudé's story; and A Closer Walk, which is about the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS. Costa e-mailed Bilheimer, Director of Worldwide Documentaries, asking him to create the film he envisioned. Costa said that he choose Bilheimer because the director had developed a \\"solid reputation [for] addressing difficult topics... combining artistic talent, a philosophical view about development and a humanitarian sentiment about what to do about the issues.\\" Bilheimer accepted Costa's proposition, and subsequently wrote, produced, and directed Not My Life as an independent film. Bilheimer, who had received an Academy Award nomination for The Cry of Reason, said that \\"the unrelenting, unpunished, and craven exploitation of millions of human beings for labor, sex, and hundreds of sub-categories thereof is simply the most appalling and damaging expression of so-called human civilization we have ever seen.\\" Bilheimer's wife, Heidi Ostertag, is Worldwide Documentaries' Senior Producer, and she co-produced Not My Life with him. She said that she found making a film about human trafficking difficult because \\"people do not want to talk about this issue.\\" Bilheimer found that the connections he had made during the production of A Closer Walk were also useful when producing Not My Life because the poor and the outcast are at the greatest risk of both HIV/AIDS and human trafficking; there is, for this reason, much overlap between the groups victimized by these two afflictions. Bilheimer attempted to fashion the film in such a way that every part of it would illustrate a statement made by Abraham Lincoln: \\"If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong.\\" When making this film, Bilheimer held that a contemporary abolitionist movement did not yet exist. He described his purpose in creating the film as to raise awareness and initiate such a movement. He also wished to communicate to his audiences that not all human trafficking is sexual. Traffickers \\"commit unspeakable, wanton acts of violence against their fellow human beings,\\" he said, \\"and are rarely punished for their crimes.\\" Production of Not My Life was supported by the United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking (UN.GIFT), UNICEF, and UNODC, providing Worldwide Documentaries with $1 million in funding secured by Costa. =Filming= Bilheimer (left) and Young during filming in Italy, one of thirteen countries in which Not My Life was shot. Bilheimer said that the level of cruelty he saw in shooting Not My Life was greater than anything he had seen when documenting apartheid in South Africa for The Cry of Reason. Bilheimer attested to becoming more aware of the global extent of human trafficking as he went about making Not My Life. The film's title came from a June 2009 interview with Molly Melching, founder of Tostan, an organization dedicated to human rights education operating in ten African countries. As Bilheimer and Melching spoke in Thiès, Senegal, discussing how people often deny the reality of contemporary slavery because it is an uncomfortable truth, Melching said, \\"People can say, 'No, this is not my life.' But my life can change. Let's change together.\\" Filming of Not My Life took place over four years in Africa, Asia, Europe, and North and South America documenting human trafficking in thirteen countries: Albania, Brazil, Cambodia, Egypt, Ghana, Guatemala, India, Italy, Nepal, Romania, Senegal, Uganda, and the United States. Shooting in Ghana took place over four 18-hour days, during which the film crew had to travel over washboard roads in Land Rovers and did not sleep. Filming in Svay Pak took place in March 2010, and shooting in Abusir, Egypt took place the following month.Rhodes, p. 2. In Guatemala, Bilheimer facilitated the arrest of trafficker Ortiz by renting a car for the police to use, in order to film the arrest as part of Not My Life.Rhodes, p. 7. Bilheimer said that, during the making of the film, he and his crew were surprised to discover that traffickers employ similar methods of intimidation across the globe, \\"almost as if there were ... unwritten bylaws and tactics ... The lies are the same.\\" =Editing= mixed-sex school in Egypt. Bilheimer removed much of the related content from the film after the Arab Spring made the information outdated. Susan Tedeschi, Derek Trucks, and Dave Brubeck performed the theme song for Not My Life, Bob Dylan's \\"Lord Protect My Child\\", which was produced by Chris Brubeck. After the initial screenings in early 2011, the film went through a series of revisions, taking into account information gathered from more than thirty screenings for focus groups. Later that year, the narration was completely rerecorded; Bilheimer replaced Ashley Judd's voice with that of Glenn Close,Rhodes, p. 55. who had previously worked with him on A Closer Walk. The version of the film that was aired by CNN International was shorter than the version shown at the premiere. An even shorter version, only 30 minutes long, was created with school audiences in mind. Content relating to the Egyptian mixed-sex schools instituted by Suzanne Mubarak was gathered, but Bilheimer eventually removed much of this content from the film because the Arab Spring made the information in this portion of the film outdated, despite the continued existence of most of these schools. Much of the interview with Molly Melching was removed as well. During the editing of Not My Life, Bilheimer cut the interview with Tutu,Rhodes, p. 35. but later re-added a single quotation. In this interview, Bilheimer told Tutu about meeting normally reasonable, compassionate women who, when speaking about human traffickers, say things like \\"Hang him up by his balls and then cut 'em off!\\" Tutu, head of the truth and reconciliation commission, surprised Bilheimer with his response, saying that \\"these people have committed monstrous acts,\\" but that, according to Christianity, traffickers can still be redeemed and become saints. Bilheimer (right) and Young (left), the film's cinematographer, during shooting in Ghana. Young died before the premiere, and the film was dedicated to him. As had occurred with Bilheimer's previous film, A Closer Walk, Not My Life had several preview screenings before its official release.Rhodes, p. 25. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) hosted a preview screening at the Willard InterContinental Washington in September 2009 as part of a day-long symposium on human trafficking. A preview screening in Egypt, including the material shot in that country that was later removed, took place in December 2010 at the International Forum against Human Trafficking in Luxor. Later that month, on December 15, the film's cinematographer and co- director Richard Young died. Not My Life was subsequently dedicated to him.Rhodes, p. 43. Bilheimer said that Young had believed in the film far more than he himself had.Rhodes, p. 52. Release The film had its official premiere in Alice Tully Hall at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City on January 19, 2011. Melanne Verveer, United States Ambassador- at-Large for Global Women's Issues, gave a speech, saying, \\"Each and every one of us is called to act. I hope that tonight each of us will make their own commitment.\\" Additional screenings were held in Los Angeles and Chicago later that month. That October, Not My Life had its international premiere in London. CNN International aired the film in two parts a few days later as part of the CNN Freedom Project. The Swedish premiere was attended by Crown Princess Victoria. Bilheimer recognized that people combatting human trafficking are in need of resources, so he considered various options with respect to the intellectual property of Not My Life, ultimately deciding to release the film at chargeRhodes, p. 38. in addition to selling licenses for unlimited private screenings.Rhodes, p. 39. On November 1, an 83-minute version of the film was released on DVD by Worldwide Documentaries, which also began digitally distributing the film and selling the unlimited licenses. LexisNexis, the governments of Arizona and Minnesota, and the U.S. Fund for UNICEF all purchased licenses. The latter organization planned to use the film as part of an anti-human-trafficking campaign. Bilheimer in Senegal, during filming. After finishing Not My Life, Bilheimer sought to use it to initiate a movement against human trafficking and contemporary slavery. Not My Life was screened at the 2012 UNIS-UN Conference in New York City, the theme of which was human exploitation. Segments from the film were included in \\"Can You Walk Away?\\", a 2012 exhibition on contemporary slavery at President Lincoln's Cottage at the Soldiers' Home in Washington, DC.Rhodes, p. 58. A hotel chain presented the film to its staff in London in preparation for the 2012 Summer Olympics to raise awareness about the types of human trafficking that might take place in conjunction with the events. Bilheimer initiated an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign in 2012 to allow local organizations opposing human trafficking to screen the film. That same year, he expressed a willingness to release fifteen-minute excerpts from the film to help its message reach more people.Rhodes, p. 40. In a 2012 interview, Bilheimer said that he considered A Closer Walk and Not My Life to be the first two installments in a trilogy; he intended to make an environmental film called Take Me Home as the third installment. As of 2013, however, the Worldwide Documentaries website stated that Bilheimer was considering different subjects for his next film, including poverty in the United States, the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, and posttraumatic stress disorder among U.S. Army veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Bilheimer said in 2013 that Not My Life \\"is not a perfect film by any means, but it is having an impact.\\" He said that he would like to be moving on to a new film project, but that he would continue promoting Not My Life because he thought it could help combat human trafficking. Throughout 2013, the World Affairs Councils of America hosted Not My Life screenings in a variety of cities across the United States, funded by the Carlson Family Foundation. That same year, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency gave Worldwide Documentaries a grant to do anti-human trafficking work over a three-year period. Not My Life was screened at the Mexican film festival Oaxaca FilmFest in November 2012; BORDEReview in Warsaw, Poland, in May 2013; and the Pasadena International Film & New Media Festival in February 2014. After Somaly Mam resigned from the Somaly Mam Foundation, Bilheimer re- edited Not My Life to remove her from the film. In May 2014, the Somaly Mam Foundation released a statement that Somaly had resigned from her leadership of the organization as a result of investigations regarding allegations about her personal history. The following month, Bilheimer released a statement in response, saying that he had re-edited the film in order to remove the scenes depicting Somaly and that the new version would be available shortly. Bilheimer wrote that \\"the storytelling in the Cambodia segment of Not My Life remains intact and is still very moving, with an even sharper focus, now, on the girls themselves.\\" In this statement, Bilheimer requested that people screening previous versions of the film tell their audiences that the presence of Somaly in the film is understandably a distraction, that the film is not primarily about Somaly but rather about the millions of children in slavery in the world, and that this focus is what is most important about the film. For the 2014 re-release of the film, Bilheimer added new content relating to India, including an interview with Kailash Satyarthi, founder of the non- governmental organization Bachpan Bachao Andolan which opposes child labor. This content emphasizes that there are more human trafficking victims in India than in any other country in the world. The new version of the film, which was co-produced with the Delhi-based Riverbank Studios, was 56 minutes long and premiered at the India International Centre in New Delhi on June 26. Satyarthi was one of the panelists in a panel discussion accompanying the screening, as was Indian filmmaker Mike Pandey, who had managed Riverbank Studios' side of the co-production. The film was scheduled to air on Doordarshan (DD) in Hindi three days later. In July, Bilheimer called his continued work on the film \\"a labor of love\\" and said that \\"far too much silence still surrounds the issue\\" of human trafficking. Reception Actress Lucy Liu spoke at the United States Agency for International Development preview screening of Not My Life, saying that 80,000 women are victims of sexual assault every day. At the USAID preview screening, actress Lucy Liu, who has worked with MTV EXIT and produced the documentary film Redlight, said that people who watch Not My Life \\"will be shocked to find [human trafficking] is happening in America\\"; she said that there were 80,000 women being sexually assaulted daily and she called human trafficking the \\"cannibalization of the planet's youth.\\" According to UN.GIFT, before Not My Life, there was \\"no single communication tool that effectively depict[ed] the problem as a whole for a mass audience.\\" Susan Bissell, UNICEF's Child Protection Section chief, agreed with this assertion, and said that the film \\"takes a close look at the underlying causality that so many other filmmakers have missed [and] it will change the way we see our lives, in some very fundamental ways.\\" She also said that Not My Life is an important documentary because it brings attention to underreported forms of abuse. A reviewer from Medical News Today praised the film for \\"raising awareness and speaking about taboo subjects,\\" arguing that these activities \\"are critical to empower families, communities, and governments to speak out honestly and take action against abuses.\\" Lucy Popescu of CineVue called the film \\"a powerful indictment of the global trade in human beings and the abuse of vulnerable people,\\" but criticized the film for focusing on human trafficking victims, arguing that the perpetrators should have been dealt with more prominently. She commended Bilheimer on the few interviews with traffickers that he did include, but she condemned as inadequate the \\"only passing reference to the thousands of men who engage in sexual tourism, like those who travel to Cambodia to 'buy' traumatized children who they can then abuse for weeks at a time.\\" Popescu also called the film \\"simplistic\\", arguing that it should have more clearly expressed that sex trafficking victims are not able to provide legitimate consent for sexual activity because they are afraid that their lives might be in danger if they do not comply. John Rash of the Star Tribune called the film \\"a cacophony of concerned voices speaking about a modern-day scourge.\\" Rash praised the film for its global scope, but suggested that this geographical breadth allows American audiences to ignore the fact that the trafficking of children is prevalent in the United States and not just in other countries. Not My Life was named Best World Documentary at the Harlem International Film Festival in September 2012. Nancy Keefe Rhodes of Stone Canoe called it a \\"highly-distilled ... remarkable film,\\" describing Bilheimer as \\"committed to strong story-telling and film-as-craft.\\" She commends Bilheimer on alternating between American sequences and scenes in other countries, allowing \\"the experiences of young women with whom an American audience may more readily identify [to] become one among many woven into the fabric of global trafficking.\\" Tripurari Sharan, Director General of DD, said that his organization was pleased to air the film and hoped that doing so would bring about greater awareness across India about human trafficking in the country. He called the film \\"both an eye-opener and a profoundly moving call to action\\".

The Eight Proposals are: # A Sustainable Development Goal for the Ocean # Governing the High Seas - Promoting care and recovery # No More Overfishing - Ending harmful high seas subsidies # Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing - Closing seas, ports and markets. # Plastics - Keeping them out of the ocean # Offshore Oil and Gas - Establishing binding safety standards and liability # Global Ocean Accountability Board - Monitoring progress towards a healthy ocean # Creating a High Seas Regeneration Zone.  Threats facing the high seas  According to research examined by the Global Ocean Commission: * Approximately half of the world’s fish stocks are fished to their maximum sustainable level, while a further third are fished beyond that level, some to commercial extinction.\\"World Review of Fisheries and Aquaculture 2010\\".

It is a Grade II listed building, with gardens originally planted by garden designer Gertrude Jekyll. Country house opera is performed by Woodhouse Opera at the annual Woodhouse Summer Opera Festival. House Built in 1926, the house was designed by architect Oliver Hill for the stage and film actor Amy Brandon Thomas and her husband William Deane Barnes-Brand. In 1939 Hill built another house for the couple, Burrows Wood in Gomshall, Surrey, which is also Grade II listed. Woodhouse Copse is a large cottage orné, originally with a thatched roof, built in brick with weatherboarding and a large, central stone chimney. Hill was influenced by Edwin Lutyens and Gertrude Jekyll in his use of local materials and vernacular architecture. However, his almost sculptural shaping of the thatch was distinctive. He built similar houses elsewhere in the 1920s, including at Croyde, Devon and Knowle in the Midlands. Woodhouse Copse also featured timbers retrieved from an old mill at Coulsdon, as commemorated in a verse engraved in 1925 on a window. The central shaft from the mill was incorporated into a spiral staircase. The house's thatch was later removed. Garden Hill laid out the garden with its terraces, drystone walls and circular steps. Over 1926–28, Jekyll drew up planting plans for the flowerbeds, and supplied the plants from her nursery at Munstead Wood, Surrey, where Amy Brandon Thomas was a frequent visitor. Music Musical performances are organised by Music at Woodhouse, which is led by Monika Saunders, the house's owner. She converted an indoor swimming pool into a concert room and created a lakeside amphitheatre for opera. Besides the annual opera festival, concerts are held throughout the year. There is a focus on using young performers, including some drawn from the Royal College of Music and the Royal Academy of Music.

This is achieved through a process of unification, where users, applications and devices gain access to a repository of captured metadata that empowers organizations to access, query and manipulate the critical components of the data to transform it into information, while providing a flexible and scalable platform for storage of the underlying data. The technology abstracts the data entirely from the storage, allowing full transparent access to users. Core technology Data defined storage focuses on metadata with an emphasis on the content, meaning and value of information over the media, type and location of data. Data centric management enables organizations to take a single, unified approach to managing data across large, distributed locations which includes the use of content and metadata indexing. The technology pillars include: # Media Independent Data Storage: Data defined storage removes media centric data storage boundaries within and across solid-state drive, hard disk drive, cloud storage and tape storage platforms, enables linear scale out functionality through a grid based Map Reduce architecture that leverages enterprise object storage technology and provides transparent data access across globally distributed repositories for high volume storage performance. #Data Security & Identity Management: Data defined storage allows organizations to gain end-to- end identity management down to the individual user and device level to address growing enterprise mobility requirements and enhanced data security and information governance. # Distributed Metadata Repository: Data defined storage enables organizations to virtualize aggregate file systems into a single global namespace. At ingestion; file, full text index and custom metadata is collected and stored in a distributed metadata repository. This repository is leveraged to enable speed and accuracy of search and discovery, and to extract value leading to informed business decisions and analytics. Data defined storage builds on the benefits of both object storage and software-defined storage technologies, however, object and software-defined storage can only be mapped to the first of data defined storage's three main pillars: media independent data storage, which enables a media agnostic infrastructure - utilizing any type of storage, including low cost commodity storage to scale out to petabyte-level capacities. Data defined storage unifies all data repositories and exposes globally distributed stores through the global namespace, eliminating data silos and improving storage utilization. The first marketing using this term was by Tarmin, in its GridBank product. The data defined storage term might have been mentioned in 2013. Tamrin issued press releases about customers. The data defined storage term was used for object storage with open protocol access for file system virtualization, such as CIFS, NFS, FTP as well as REST APIs and other cloud protocols such as Amazon S3, CDMI and OpenStack.

Family background Hugo Schwyzer was born in Santa Barbara, California, to Hubert (1935–2006) and Alison Schwyzer, both of whom were professors of philosophy: Hubert taught at the University of California, Santa Barbara; Alison at Monterey Peninsula College. His younger brother, Philip, also pursued an academic career and is now Professor of Renaissance Literature at the University of Exeter, England. Hugo himself was an instructor of history and gender studies at Pasadena City College for nearly twenty years. Schwyzer's parents divorced when he was young. He and his brother were then raised by his mother in Carmel, California. However, Schwyzer maintained a profound connection to his father, who was taken to England as a child when his parents fled Austria after the Anschluss, and later emigrated to California. His paternal grandfather, Georg, was a Vienna-based Jewish physician while his paternal grandmother, Elsa, was half-Jewish.Hugo Schwyzer, Why I Won't Tell Anyone To Calm Down, Nov 10, 2016 Academic career Schwyzer studied history at University of California, Berkeley, specializing in medieval history. He developed a passion for this subject after seeing Derek Jacobi perform Shakespeare's Richard II. He attended graduate school at UCLA and was awarded his PhD in 1999. His doctoral dissertation was entitled \\"Arms and the Bishop: The Anglo-Scottish War and the Northern Episcopate, 1296–1357\\", and dealt with the military role of the Bishops of Durham and the Archbishops of York during the Wars of Scottish Independence. He published a related book chapter, \\"Northern bishops and the Anglo-Scottish War in the reign of Edward II\\", in Thirteenth Century England 7 (1999). His three areas of study at graduate level were: *Medieval English philosophy – William of Ockham & Duns Scotus *Early Irish monasticism, and the Collectio canonum Hibernensis * Early modern economic development, especially proto-industrialization Schwyzer joined the Pasadena City College faculty as an adjunct instructor in 1993, and was then soon hired to a tenure-track position in 1994. Over the course of the following two decades, he taught various history and gender studies courses at PCC, as well as co-taught an interdisciplinary humanities course alongside English and psychology faculty members. After a 20-year career, he was forced to resign in October 2013 due to personal issues and public controversies. In February 2013, Schwyzer invited adult film actor James Deen to return to his alma mater, Pasadena City College, to speak to students about his career. The appearance, initially open to the public, was restricted by college administrators due to \\"public safety concerns\\" over \\"protesters\\". Deen was restricted to speaking to the students of Pasadena City College's \\"Navigating Pornography\\" class. Other activities Schwyzer was a prolific writer and wrote on topics both public and deeply personal, stemming from his own curiosities as well as the inquisitiveness of others. He has written for such publications as Jezebel and The Atlantic, was a contributor to The Good Men Project, and co-authored Beauty, Disrupted: A Memoir, a biography of supermodel Carré Otis published in October 2011 by HarperCollins. Controversies Schwyzer became the subject of controversy when he disclosed to school administration and the general public his many affairs with his young female college students. In several blog posts and interviews, Schwyzer further admitted to an ongoing problem with alcohol and drug abuse, a decades-long struggle with borderline personality disorder and bipolar depression, and a violent murder-suicide attempt with his ex-girlfriend while both were under the influence of narcotics in the summer of 1998. On August 9, 2013, Schwyzer tweeted a rapid- fire series of confessions described as a \\"meltdown\\"; his tweet storm included confessions of sex with porn stars who had spoken in his classes, as well as his own absence of credentials to teach women's studies. When white feminists expressed concern for Schwyzer's mental health, black activist Mikki Kendall created the hashtag #solidarityisforwhitewomen, which rapidly trended worldwide. In an op-ed for the Guardian, Kendall noted that \\"Hugo Schwyzer's Twitter confession was the catalyst\\" for the hashtag's creation and subsequent popularity. In September 2013, the college announced that it was launching an investigation of Schwyzer that could lead to his termination. In the media, Schwyzer indicated that he would resign and leave quietly if the college allowed him to remain on salary until the end of the year, at which time health benefits and disability retirement would have commenced. The college denied this request. On October 8, 2013, Schwyzer resigned and the college investigation closed. A week earlier, writing under the heading \\"Picking up a felony DUI\\", Schwyzer announced that he had been involved in a car crash, causing injury to a 25-year-old woman. The incident occurred on Friday, 27 September 2013, near San Juan Bautista, California. Schwyzer apologized to the injured woman before she was airlifted to hospital, made a full confession to law enforcement, and also stated \\"I am a danger to myself and others and mitigating that danger is vital.\\" He was then charged with felony DUI and released from San Benito County Jail on bail of $100,000. A court date of 5 November 2013 was given. Schwyzer was reported to be in \\"an extended treatment program in Malibu, California, focusing on mental illness and chemical dependency.\\" In an April 2015 blog comment, Schwyzer claimed that the DUI matter had been resolved, but that he had been asked not to comment on the matter further. Current status In January 2014, Schwyzer began working as a tax accounting assistant in Los Angeles. In March 2015, in the final entry on his blog, Schwyzer noted that he was not \\"coming back\\" nor planning any \\"grand return\\" to public life. As of October 2018, Schwyzer was reported to be working at a Trader Joe's. Personal life Schwyzer has been divorced four times. He has two children, Heloise Cerys Raquel (born 2009) and David Aneurin Nikola (born 2012), with fourth ex-wife Eira Victoria Chumrau.

Starring by Marianela González accompanied by Juan Manuel Mendoza and the first actor Victor Mallarino with the stellar performance of Vicky Hernandes and Kristina Lilley. Plot The story begins when Maria Herra, a very hard-working humble young woman and mother of a girl, meets a rich successful man. Both fall in love hopelessly, but he is married to Annie, with whom he has a son, Esteban. He has to decide between Maria and his family, and as always, the love he had felt for Maria wasn't enough for him to leave his family, so he broke her out. But what Eduardo didn't know is that Maria was expecting his son. Maria decides to find Eduardo to tell him the truth, but when she went to his house, Olga the maid, tells her that he is on trip with his wife. She asks the maid to give him a letter, because he needs to know the truth. The maid insists she leave with the promise that she would hand the letter to Eduardo but this letter was never given to Eduardo. This was because Olga thinks that it would ruin her boss's marriage, so she destroys the letter. As time passes and Maria had given birth, Gracia, Maria's mother, decides to tell Eduardo he is a father to Maria's child. But she doesn't get the chance to speak to him, because Eduardo's father doesn't allow her to. He tells her to leave Eduardo alone, as he doesn't want to know about Maria and gives her a check to never come back again. She took the money to help her daughter and she left. However, during the talk between María and Eduardo Eduardo widgets maria's love making sure depressing hence making the Child with an autism birth trauma. Then she committed suicide.

JEDI coordinates with the several other space physics instruments on the Juno spacecraft to characterize and understand the space environment of Jupiter's polar regions, and specifically to understand the generation of Jupiter's powerful aurora. It is part of a suite of instruments to study the magnetosphere of Jupiter. JEDI consists of three identical detectors that use microchannel plates and foil layers to detect the energy, angle, and types of ion within a certain range. It can detect electrons between 40 and 500 keV (Kilo electron-volts), and hydrogen and oxygen from a few tens of keV to less than 1000 keV (1 MeV). JEDI uses radiation hardened Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC)s. JEDI was turned on in January 2016 while still en route to Jupiter to also study interplanetary space. JEDI uses solid state detectors (SSD's) to measure the total energy (E) of both the ions and the electrons. The MCP anodes and the SSD arrays are configured to determine the directions of arrivals of the incoming charged particles. The instruments also use fast triple coincidence and optimum shielding to suppress penetrating background radiation and incoming UV foreground. JEDI is designed to collect data on \\"energy, spectra, mass species (H, He, O, S), and angular distributions\\"; the plan is to study the energies and distribution of charged particles. It can detect them at between 30 keV and 1 GeV, whereas JADE, another instrument on the spacecraft, is designed to observe below 30 keV.NASA - Video on JEDI One of the concepts being studied is that energy from Jupiter's rotation is being converted into its atmosphere and magnetosphere. It is radiation hardened to collect in situ data on the planet's auroral magnetic field lines, the equatorial magnetosphere, and the polar ionosphere It was built by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL). One of the goals is to understand the aurora, and how particles are accelerated to such high speeds. One of the mysteries of Jupiter is that X-rays are emitted from the poles, but do not seem to come from the auroral ring. Each detector has a field of view of 120 degree by 12 degrees, and they are positioned to provide a 360 degree (a full circle) view of the sky along that axis. The Juno spacecraft travels very rapidly in the close vicinity of Jupiter (up to 50 km/s) and also spins very slowly (2 RPM). JEDI can detected particles from 30 to 1000 keV including: *Electrons *Proton (hydrogen) ions *Helium ions *Sulfur ions *Oxygen ions *Energetic neutral atoms (ENA's) In relation to other space missions, an instrument on the Earth-orbiting Van Allen Probes (launched 2012), called RBSPICE, is nearly identical to JEDI. This type of instrument is also similar to the PEPSSI instrument on New Horizons (Pluto/Kupiter probe). JEDI in combination with data from UVIS detected electrical potentials of 400,000 electron volts (400 keV), 20–30 times higher than Earth, driving charged particles into the polar regions of Jupiter. A scientific paper Juno observations of energetic charged particles over Jupiter's polar regions: Analysis of monodirectional and bidirectional electron beams included results from a close pass over Jupiter's poles in August 2016 for electrons (25–800 keV) and protons (10–1500 keV). The paper analyzed electron angular beams in the auroral regions.

She and her daughter had a reputation for violence, especially towards their servants. In February 1740, the pair decided that their maid had been loitering on an errand and beat the servant to death. They buried the girl, claiming she died of natural causes, but the body was exhumed. The pair were tried for murder at the Somerset assizes, with the jury delivering a guilty verdict without even retiring. Elizabeth and her daughter were hanged at Ilchester on 3 May 1740. Early life Elizabeth Parry was born in 1672 in Bristol, the youngest daughter of the family. Her father was a ship's surgeon, earning his fortune as shipmaster. She married Benjamin Branch, a landholding farmer and her father gave the couple a dowry of £2000 (), which supplemented Branch's income of £300 per year () Cruelty to servants Elizabeth quickly gained a reputation for violence. She and her daughter, Betty Branch (listed as Mary Branch in the Newgate Calendar), would torture small animals, apparently taking inspiration from stories of Nero. They would often beat and humiliate their servants, especially after the death of Benjamin in 1730, so that soon no local persons were willing to serve them. Murder and trial On 13 February 1740, as witnessed by Anne James (listed as Ann Somers in the Newgate Calendar), the dairymaid, Elizabeth sent her 13-year-old serving maid Jane Buttersworth on an errand to a nearby farm. On her return, Elizabeth and Betty, irate at how long she had taken, beat her for almost seven hours until she died. They buried her secretly, claiming that she had died of natural causes, but enough suspicion was aroused that locals exhumed her body. They brought it to the local surgeon who examined the body and found wounds which would have \\"kill'd the stoutest man\\". Elizabeth and Betty were tried for murder on 31 March at the Somerset assizes. The jury returned a guilty verdict without retiring to deliberate, and the two women were hanged at Ilchester on 3 May before six in the morning to reduce the possibility of an angry mob.

He was a member of the Croatian Parliament in 2011–2013, a member of the European Parliament in 2013–2016, as well as the 13th Minister of Foreign and European Affairs of Croatia in 2016–2017.  Family and studies  Stier was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina and lived in the middle-class Flores district (the same of Pope Francis) in a Croatian expatriate family originating from Samobor. His paternal grandfather Ivan Stier was an Ustaše colonel and assistant to Vjekoslav Luburić who escaped to South America after World War II. His maternal grandfather, Milorad Lukač, was one of the leading emigrant politicians of the Croatian Peasant Party. Stier's father was a doctor and his mother Marija Lukač was a university professor. Stier came to Croatia for the first time in 1990 at 18 as part of the Croatian Heritage Foundation program, and for the second time three weeks before the fall of Vukovar as a journalist for the Argentine newspaper El Cronista and Radio America. He returned to Argentina in February 1992, where he graduated in Political Science and International Relations at the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina, and later on in journalism.  Political career  Stier returned to Croatia in 1996 at the invitation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, after which he worked in the Croatian embassies in Washington and Brussels, and by 2009 was foreign policy adviser to Prime Minister Ivo Sanader. At the 2011 parliamentary elections, Stier was elected a member of the Croatian Parliament. He became a member of the Interparliamentary Cooperation Committee and the Committee for European Integration, and was appointed Vice-Chairman of the Foreign Policy Committee. He was also nominated a member of the Croatian Parliament delegation at the NATO Parliamentary Assembly and the Croatian Parliament delegation at the Joint Parliamentary Committee of the Republic of Croatia. Stier was one of the closest associates of Jadranka Kosor and her adviser and delegate for Euro-Atlantic cooperation. During the Slovenian-Croatian diplomatic freeze, Stier was the main participant in the behind-the scenes diplomacy effort and mediator between Kosor and the Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor. In the May 2012 HDZ leadership contest, Stier supported Tomislav Karamarko but was later opposed to the disciplinary proceedings against Jadranka Kosor in February 2013, after the party decided to sanction her because of her appearances in the media. In September 2012, Stier asked the Croatian government to desist from ratification of the state border dispute between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, claiming that in so doing Croatia would have agreed to participate in blackmail politics and linked European Union membership to border issues. He accused Bosnia and Herzegovina's Transport Minister Damir Hadzic of blackmailing the Croatian government by stating that Bosnia and Herzegovina would not allow the construction of the Peljesac bridge unless Croatia ratified the border agreement. In April 2013, Stier said that the prerequisite for Bosnia and Herzegovina to enter the European Union would be the institutional equality of Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Two months later, in June, Stier stated that \\"Croatia must strongly take up the issue of the constituency of the Croatian people in Bosnia and Herzegovina not only on paper but also in practice.\\" He estimated that the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was \\"a de facto Bosniak entity\\" and announced the possibility of Bosnia and Herzegovina being reformed according to the Belgian model. He also said that Croatia would use Croatia's accession to the European Union to resolve the Croat issue in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Following Croatia's EU accession, in the first elections to the European Parliament in Croatia in April 2013, Stier won 14 005 votes on the list of the HDZ coalition that was composed of HSP AS and BUZ. With 5.75% of votes cast, he became one of the first Members of the European Parliament from Croatia.Izbori članova u Europski parlament iz Republike Hrvatske.

For example, James Joyce's Ulysses could be regarded as one of the many hypertexts deriving from Homer's Odyssey; Angela Carter's \\"The Tiger's Bride\\" can be considered a hypertext which relates to an earlier work, or hypotext, the original fairy- story Beauty and the Beast. Hypertexts may take a variety of forms including imitation, parody, and pastiche. The word was defined by the French theorist Gérard Genette as follows: \\"Hypertextuality refers to any relationship uniting a text B (which I shall call the hypertext) to an earlier text A (I shall, of course, call it the hypotext), upon which it is grafted in a manner that is not that of commentary.\\" So, a hypertext derives from hypotext(s) through a process which Genette calls transformation, in which text B \\"evokes\\" text A without necessarily mentioning it directly \\". Note that this technical use of the word in semiotics differs from its use to mean a link in the field of , although the two are related. Liestøl's study of Genette's narratological model and hyperfiction considers how they are related and suggests that hyperfiction narratives have four levels: * 1. Discourse as discoursed; * 2.

It is known from two fossil specimens, one preserving the front part of the skull and the other preserving part of the lower jaw. Hoburogekko is one of four known Mesozoic geckos or gecko-like lizards, the others being Cretaceogekko from the Early Cretaceous of Burma, AMNH FR21444, an undescribed specimen from a slightly older deposit in Mongolia, and Gobekko from the Late Cretaceous of Mongolia. Hoburogekko is the third oldest known gecko behind AMNH FR21444 and Cretaceogekko. Description The living gecko species Agamura persica has a tall, blunt snout like Hoburogekko and lives in an arid environment like that which is inferred for Hoburogekko. The skull of Hoburogekko is short, blunt, and tall. The proportions of its skull bones are similar to those of the living genus Bunopus, although the two are not closely related. The general appearance of Hoburogekko resembles that of the living species Agamura persica, Bunopus tuberculatus, Pristurus carteri, Ptenopus carpi, and Teratoscincus przewalskii, all of which have blunt and tall snouts. Most of these species live on the ground and inhabit desert regions. Hoburogekko probably had a similar lifestyle, fitting with sedimentological evidence that the region of Mongolia in which it was found was semi-arid during the Early Cretaceous. By comparison with living blunt-snouted, desert-dwelling geckos, Hoburogekko may have had a cylindrical body adapted for a burrowing lifestyle. The total length of the skull of Hoburogekko is estimated to be . The total body length of Hoburogekko difficult to extrapolate from its skull alone because the relative size of the head to the rest of the body varies greatly among living geckos. Based on this range of proportions, Hoburogekko may have been anywhere between long. Hoburogekko appears primitive in having an open Meckelian groove in the lower jaw that is open at the back and a it is inferred that had a large jugal bone beneath the eye socket, but it is similar to living geckos in having a frontal bone that forms a tube along the midline of the skull. Other derived features of geckos possessed by Hoburogekko include smooth skull bones. Another derived gekkotan characteristic, eye sockets that are not bounded in the back by postorbital bars, may have been present in Hoburogekko, although only the front portion of the eye socket is preserved in the known specimens of Hoburogekko. The large size of the jugal bone suggests that it may have extended backward to form a postorbital bar, in which case Hoburogekko would appear more primitive. Relationships The broad-tailed gecko, Phyllurus platurus, as well as other members of Carphodactylidae, may be closely related to Hoburogekko. Hoburogekko was recognized as a close relative of geckos since it was first named in 1989. However, a paucity of distinguishing characteristics in the two known specimens of Hoburogekko meant that its evolutionary relationships were not evaluated in a phylogenetic analysis until many years after its first description. The phylogenetic analysis of Daza et al. (2012) found Hoburogekko to be closely related to the living species Phyllurus platurus, commonly called the broad-tailed gecko. In the analysis, Hoburogekko and Phyllurus are more closely related to the legless pygopodids than they are to most other geckos, burt this position need to be re-evaluated, including more members of the crown group Gekkota. The analysis also included Norellius nyctisaurops and Gobekko and placed them outside Gekkota, the group that includes true geckos, as more basal members of the larger group Gekkonomorpha. Therefore, Hoburogekko may be the most derived of the four known Mesozoic gekkonomorphs. However, the analysis of Daza et al. (2013) placed Hoburogekko in a polytomy or unresolved evolutionary relationship with Gobekko, P. platurus (representing the family Carphodactylidae), pygopodids, and a clade (evolutionary grouping) including all other geckos, meaning that its position within Gekkonomorpha is still uncertain.

The company also issued credit cards through its LendUp Card Services division, which ultimately became Mission Lane LLC. The company is licensed as a payday lender in 24 states. Founders LendUp's co-founders are step brothers Sasha Orloff and Jake Rosenberg. Through school and early jobs they went separate ways. Orloff worked in consumer credit and then venture capital at Grameen Bank, World Bank and Citi. Following an internship at 16, Rosenberg became Yahoo! employee #80 and stayed for more than a decade, before joining Zynga as a platform CTO at 29. In the summer of 2011 Orloff asked Rosenberg to join him to found LendUp. They sought to solve problems with the financial services industry, which Rosenberg claimed could be solved through technology. Funding and board advisors LendUp graduated out of the Y Combinator batch of 2012. It has received $325 million in equity and debt financing from PayPal, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Google Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Alexis Ohanian and QED among others. In August, 2016 LendUp announced its Series C round of equity, led by Y Combinator. In March 2017, LendUp announced it received a $100 million credit facility from Victory Park Capital and surpassed $1 billion in loan originations. Nigel Morris, co-founder of Capital One and QED Investors, serves as LendUp's Board Chair. Other Board members include QED co- founder Frank Rotman, an early Capital One Financial Corp. executive and its long-time chief credit officer, and Blake Byers of GV.Board advisors include Carrie Dolan, Ali Rowghani, and others. History Like other payday loan companies, LendUp loans to customers that banks usually decline, giving borrowers with poor credit scores access to credit cards and short term loans. Many of the loans offered by the company are advertised as an alternative to payday loans for customers, but carry interest rates comparable to other payday lenders. LendUp's two Visa cards are issued by TAB Bank and Beneficial State Bank. They feature longer-than-usual grace periods before late fees kick in, and interest rates range from about 20 to 30 percent on credit lines up to $2,000. The card business is growing more quickly than the firm's lending product. LendUp has called its customers “the emerging middle class.” Its customers generally have credit scores below 680. In September 2016, LendUp was fined by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for charging illegal fees, miscalculating interest rates and failing to report information to credit bureaus.' The company agreed to pay $6.3 million in penalties and customer repayments. In May 2017, LendUp announced plans to quadruple the number of credit cards available to consumers through its partnership with Beneficial State Bank. As of May 2018, the company had surpassed this goal. In June 2017, LendUp and the Aspen Institute Financial Security Program launched Finance Forward, alongside Mayor Stephen K Benjamin of Columbia, SC. Finance Forward is a multi-city event series that brings together elected officials, businesses, community advocates and nonprofit leaders to identify and advance actionable solutions to the growing problem of income volatility in the U.S. In November, 2017, the company announced that former Tesla executive William Donnelly joined as CFO. In January 2019, Anu Shultes was named CEO, replacing Orloff.

Flamson was born and died at Heather, Leicestershire. Flamson was a right-arm medium-fast bowler and a right-handed tail-end batsman. He appeared in a couple of first-class matches in the 1934 season but made little impression, and did not return until 1937 when he was taken on to the Leicestershire full-time staff, and won praise from Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. In what it termed one of Leicestershire's worst ever seasons, it wrote, \\"probably the only satisfactory feature of the bowling was the advance of Flamson, who in his first full season of county cricket, accomplished some splendid performances\\". It went on: \\"He developed as the season progressed and towards the close often carried the attack on his shoulders. Powerfully built and with a run-up similar to that of George Geary, he put plenty of 'shoulder' into his medium-fast deliveries and had the knack of making the ball keep unexpectedly low.\\" Flamson took 60 wickets in 19 matches in 1937 at the high average of 33.78 runs per wicket. Against Nottinghamshire in his second match of the season he took seven first innings wickets for 46 runs and these remained the best figures of his career. He achieved his best match figures in Leicestershire's only victory of the season, the game against Hampshire, when he took six for 61 and three for 51 to finish with nine for 112 in the game. Flamson was still a regular member of the side though he took fewer wickets in 1938 – 53 wickets in the season at the lower average of 27.41 – and he missed a month of the season through injury. His one innings of note as a batsman was in this season: he made an unbeaten 50 in half an hour in the game against Northamptonshire. In 1939, in an unsuccessful team that finished at the bottom of the County Championship, Flamson was himself not successful, taking 36 wickets at the very high average of 38.16. He lost his place in the team at the start of July, though he returned for a single match towards the end of August which proved to be the last match of his first-class cricket career. He died at the age of 40 in January 1945, before first-class cricket had resumed.

It was originated and published by African- American New York City mailman Victor Hugo Green from 1936 to 1966, during the era of Jim Crow laws, when open and often legally prescribed discrimination against African Americans especially and other non-whites was widespread. Although pervasive racial discrimination and poverty limited black car ownership, the emerging African-American middle class bought automobiles as soon as they could, but faced a variety of dangers and inconveniences along the road, from refusal of food and lodging to arbitrary arrest. In response, Green wrote his guide to services and places relatively friendly to African- Americans, eventually expanding its coverage from the New York area to much of North America, as well as founding a travel agency. Many black Americans took to driving, in part to avoid segregation on public transportation. As the writer George Schuyler put it in 1930, \\"all Negroes who can do so purchase an automobile as soon as possible in order to be free of discomfort, discrimination, segregation and insult\\".Franz, p. 242. Black Americans employed as athletes, entertainers, and salesmen also traveled frequently for work purposes. African-American travelers faced hardships such as white-owned businesses refusing to serve them or repair their vehicles, being refused accommodation or food by white-owned hotels, and threats of physical violence and forcible expulsion from whites-only \\"sundown towns\\". Green founded and published the Green Book to avoid such problems, compiling resources \\"to give the Negro traveler information that will keep him from running into difficulties, embarrassments and to make his trip more enjoyable\\". The maker of a 2019 documentary film about the book offered this summary: \\"Everyone I was interviewing talked about the community that the Green Book created: a kind of parallel universe that was created by the book and this kind of secret road map that the Green Book outlined\\". From a New York-focused first edition published in 1936, Green expanded the work to cover much of North America, including most of the United States and parts of Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Bermuda. The Green Book became \\"the bible of black travel during Jim Crow\\", enabling black travelers to find lodgings, businesses, and gas stations that would serve them along the road. It was little known outside the African-American community. Shortly after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed the types of racial discrimination that had made the Green Book necessary, publication ceased and it fell into obscurity. There has been a revived interest in it in the early 21st century in connection with studies of black travel during the Jim Crow era. Four issues (1940, 1947, 1954, and 1963) have been republished in facsimile (as of December 2017), and have sold well. Twenty-three additional issues have now been digitized by the New York Public Library Digital Collections.https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/the-green- book#/?tab=about African-American travel experiences Victor Hugo Green in 1956 Before the legislative accomplishments of the Civil Rights Movement, black travelers in the United States faced major problems unknown to most whites. White supremacists had long sought to restrict black mobility, and were uniformly hostile to black strangers. As a result, simple auto journeys for black people were fraught with difficulty and potential danger. They were subjected to racial profiling by police departments (\\"driving while black\\"), sometimes seen as \\"uppity\\" or \\"too prosperous\\" just for the act of driving, which many whites regarded as a white prerogative. They risked harassment or worse on and off the highway.Seiler, p. 88. A bitter commentary published in a 1947 issue of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's magazine, The Crisis, highlighted the uphill struggle blacks faced in recreational travel: Thousands of communities in the US had enacted Jim Crow laws that existed after 1890; in such sundown towns, African-Americans were in danger if they stayed past sunset. Such restrictions dated back to colonial times, and were found throughout the United States. After the end of legal slavery in the North and later in the South after the Civil War, most freedmen continued to live at little more than a subsistence level, but a minority of African-Americans gained a measure of prosperity. They could plan leisure travel for the first time. Well-to-do blacks arranged large group excursions for as many as 2,000 people at a time, for instance traveling by rail from New Orleans to resorts along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. In the pre-Jim Crow era this necessarily meant mingling with whites in hotels, transportation and leisure facilities. They were aided in this by the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which had made it illegal to discriminate against African-Americans in public accommodations and public transportation. They encountered a white backlash, particularly in the South, where by 1877 white Democrats controlled every state government. The Act was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1883, resulting in states and cities passing numerous segregation laws. White governments in the South required even interstate railroads to enforce their segregation laws, despite national legislation requiring equal treatment of passengers. The Supreme Court of the United States ruled in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) that \\"separate but equal\\" accommodations were constitutional, but in practice, facilities for blacks were far from equal, generally being of lesser quality and underfunded. Blacks faced restrictions and exclusion throughout the United States: if not barred entirely from facilities, they could use them only at different times from whites or in (usually inferior) \\"colored sections\\". \\"Separate but equal\\" in practice; a separate \\"Negro Area\\" at Lewis Mountain in Shenandoah National Park In 1917, black writer W. E. B. Du Bois observed that the impact of \\"ever- recurring race discrimination\\" had made it so difficult to travel to any number of destinations, from popular resorts to major cities, that it was now \\"a puzzling query as to what to do with vacations\\". It was a problem that came to affect an increasing number of black people in the first decades of the 20th century. Tens of thousands of southern African-Americans migrated from farms in the south to factories and domestic service in the north. No longer confined to living at a subsistence level, many gained disposable income and time to engage in leisure travel. The development of affordable mass-produced automobiles liberated black Americans from having to rely on the \\"Jim Crow cars\\" – smoky, battered and uncomfortable railroad carriages which were the separate but decidedly unequal alternatives to more salubrious whites-only carriages. One black magazine writer commented in 1933, in an automobile, \\"it's mighty good to be the skipper for a change, and pilot our craft whither and where we will. We feel like Vikings. What if our craft is blunt of nose and limited of power and our sea is macademized; it's good for the spirit to just give the old railroad Jim Crow the laugh.\\" Middle-class blacks throughout the United States \\"were not at all sure how to behave or how whites would behave toward them\\", as Bart Landry puts it.Landry, p. 58. In Cincinnati, the African-American newspaper editor Wendell Dabney wrote of the situation in the 1920s that \\"hotels, restaurants, eating and drinking places, almost universally are closed to all people in whom the least tincture of colored blood can be detected\\". Areas without significant black populations outside the South often refused to accommodate them: black travelers to Salt Lake City in the 1920s were stranded without a hotel if they had to stop there overnight. Only six percent of the more than 100 motels that lined U.S. Route 66 in Albuquerque, admitted black customers. Across the whole state of New Hampshire, only three motels in 1956 served African-Americans.Rugh, p. 77. George Schuyler reported in 1943, \\"Many colored families have motored all across the United States without being able to secure overnight accommodations at a single tourist camp or hotel.\\" He suggested that black Americans would find it easier to travel abroad than in their own country. In Chicago in 1945, St. Clair Drake and Horace A. Cayton reported that \\"the city's hotel managers, by general agreement, do not sanction the use of hotel facilities by Negroes, particularly sleeping accommodations\\".Drake & Cayton, p. 107. One incident reported by Drake and Cayton illustrated the discriminatory treatment meted out even to blacks within racially mixed groups: =Coping with discrimination on the road= An African-American family with their new Oldsmobile in Washington, D.C., 1955 While automobiles made it much easier for black Americans to be independently mobile, the difficulties they faced in traveling were such that, as Lester B. Granger of the National Urban League puts it, \\"so far as travel is concerned, Negroes are America's last pioneers\\".Seiler, p. 87. Black travelers often had to carry buckets or portable toilets in the trunks of their cars because they were usually barred from bathrooms and rest areas in service stations and roadside stops. Travel essentials such as gasoline were difficult to purchase because of discrimination at gas stations. To avoid such problems on long trips, African-Americans often packed meals and carried containers of gasoline in their cars. Writing of the road trips that he made as a boy in the 1950s, Courtland Milloy of the Washington Post recalled that his mother spent the evening before the trip frying chicken and boiling eggs so that his family would have something to eat along the way the next day. One black motorist observed in the early 1940s that while black travelers felt free in the mornings, by the early afternoon a \\"small cloud\\" had appeared. By the late afternoon, \\"it casts a shadow of apprehension on our hearts and sours us a little. 'Where', it asks us, 'will you stay tonight?'\\" They often had to spend hours in the evening trying to find somewhere to stay, sometimes resorting to sleeping in haylofts or in their own cars if they could not find anywhere. One alternative, if it was available, was to arrange in advance to sleep at the homes of black friends in towns or cities along their route. However, this meant detours and an abandonment of the spontaneity that for many was a key attraction of motoring. The civil rights leader John Lewis recalled how his family prepared for a trip in 1951: Finding accommodation was one of the greatest challenges faced by black travelers. Not only did many hotels, motels, and boarding houses refuse to serve black customers, but thousands of towns across the United States declared themselves \\"sundown towns\\", which all non-whites had to leave by sunset. Huge numbers of towns across the country were effectively off-limits to African-Americans. By the end of the 1960s, there were an estimated 10,000 sundown towns across the United States – including large suburbs such as Glendale, California (population 60,000 at the time); Levittown, New York (80,000); and Warren, Michigan (180,000). Over half the incorporated communities in Illinois were sundown towns. The unofficial slogan of Anna, Illinois, which had violently expelled its African-American population in 1909, was \\"Ain't No Niggers Allowed\\".Loewen, pp. 15–16. Even in towns which did not exclude overnight stays by blacks, accommodations were often very limited. African-Americans migrating to California to find work in the early 1940s often found themselves camping by the roadside overnight for lack of any hotel accommodation along the way.Flamming, p. 166. They were acutely aware of the discriminatory treatment that they received. Courtland Milloy's mother, who took him and his brother on road trips when they were children, recalled: \\"We cater to white trade only\\"; many hotels and restaurants excluded African-Americans, such as this one in Ohio, seen in 1938. African-American travelers faced real physical risks because of the widely differing rules of segregation that existed from place to place, and the possibility of extrajudicial violence against them. Activities that were accepted in one place could provoke violence a few miles down the road. Transgressing formal or unwritten racial codes, even inadvertently, could put travelers in considerable danger.Trembanis, p. 49. Even driving etiquette was affected by racism; in the Mississippi Delta region, local custom prohibited blacks from overtaking whites, to prevent their raising dust from the unpaved roads to cover white-owned cars. A pattern emerged of whites purposely damaging black-owned cars to put their owners \\"in their place\\". Stopping anywhere that was not known to be safe, even to allow children in a car to relieve themselves, presented a risk; Milloy noted that his parents would urge him and his brother to control their need to use a bathroom until they could find a safe place to stop, as \\"those backroads were simply too dangerous for parents to stop to let their little black children pee\\". Racist local laws, discriminatory social codes, segregated commercial facilities, racial profiling by police, and sundown towns made road journeys a minefield of constant uncertainty and risk. Road trip narratives by blacks reflected their unease and the dangers they faced, presenting a more complex outlook from those written by whites extolling the joys of the road. Milloy recalls the menacing environment that he encountered during his childhood, in which he learned of \\"so many black travelers ... just not making it to their destinations\\". Even foreign black dignitaries were not immune to the discrimination that African-American travelers routinely encountered. In one high-profile incident, Komla Agbeli Gbedemah, the finance minister of newly independent Ghana, was refused service at a Howard Johnson's restaurant at Dover, Delaware, while traveling to Washington, D.C., even after identifying himself by his state position to the restaurant staff.Seiler, p. 84. The snub caused an international incident, to which an embarrassed President Dwight D. Eisenhower responded by inviting Gbedemah to breakfast at the White House.DeCaro, p. 124. Repeated and sometimes violent incidents of discrimination directed against black African diplomats, particularly on U.S. Route 40 between New York and Washington, D.C., led to the administration of President John F. Kennedy setting up a Special Protocol Service Section within the State Department to assist black diplomats traveling and living within the United States.Lentz & Gower, p. 149. The State Department considered issuing copies of The Negro Motorist Green Book to black diplomats, but eventually decided against steering them to black-friendly public accommodations as it wanted them to be treated equally to white diplomats.Wallach, p. 191. John A. Williams wrote in his 1965 book, This Is My Country Too, that he did not believe \\"white travelers have any idea of how much nerve and courage it requires for a Negro to drive coast to coast in America\\". He achieved it with \\"nerve, courage, and a great deal of luck\\", supplemented by \\"a rifle and shotgun, a road atlas, and Travelguide, a listing of places in America where Negroes can stay without being embarrassed, insulted, or worse\\". He noted that black drivers needed to be particularly cautious in the South, where they were advised to wear a chauffeur's cap or have one visible on the front seat and pretend they were delivering a car for a white person. Along the way, he had to endure a stream of \\"insults of clerks, bellboys, attendants, cops, and strangers in passing cars\\". There was a constant need to keep his mind on the danger he faced; as he was well aware, \\"[black] people have a way of disappearing on the road\\".Primeau, p. 117.  Role of the Green Book  The Green Book listed places—like this motel in South Carolina—that provided accommodation for black travelers. Segregation meant that facilities for African-American motorists were limited, but entrepreneurs of both races realized the lucrative opportunities in marketing goods and services to black patrons. The challenge for travelers was to find such oases in the middle of a desert of discrimination. To address this problem, African-American writers produced a number of guides to provide travel advice. These included directories of hotels, camps, road houses, and restaurants which would serve African-Americans. Jewish travelers, who had long experienced discrimination at many vacation spots, created guides for their own community, though they were at least able to visibly blend in more easily with the general population.Jefferson, p. 26. African-Americans followed suit with publications such as Hackley and Harrison's Hotel and Apartment Guide for Colored Travelers, published in 1930 to cover \\"Board, Rooms, Garage Accommodations, etc. in 300 Cities in the United States and Canada\\".Brevard, p. 62. The Negro Motorist Green Book was one of the best known of the African-American travel guides. It was conceived in 1932 and first published in 1936 by Victor H. Green, a World War I veteran from New York City who worked as a mail carrier and later as a travel agent. He said his aim was \\"to give the Negro traveler information that will keep him from running into difficulties, embarrassments and to make his trip more enjoyable\\".Franz, p. 246. According to an editorial written by Novera C. Dashiell in the 1956 edition of the Green Book, \\"the idea crystallized when not only [Green] but several friends and acquaintances complained of the difficulties encountered; oftentimes painful embarrassments suffered which ruined a vacation or business trip\\". Green asked his readers to provide information \\"on the Negro motoring conditions, scenic wonders in your travels, places visited of interest and short stories on one's motoring experience\\". He offered a reward of one dollar for each accepted account, which he increased to five dollars by 1941. He also obtained information from colleagues in the U.S. Postal Service, who would \\"ask around on their routes\\" to find suitable public accommodations. The Postal Service was and remains one of the largest employers of African-Americans, and its employees were ideally situated to inform Green of which places were safe and hospitable to African- American travelers. The Green Book's motto, displayed on the front cover, urged black travelers to \\"Carry your Green Book with you – You may need it\\". The 1949 edition included a quote from Mark Twain: \\"Travel is fatal to prejudice\\", inverting Twain's original meaning; as Cotten Seiler puts it, \\"here it was the visited, rather than the visitors, who would find themselves enriched by the encounter\\".Seiler, p. 92. Green commented in 1940 that the Green Book had given black Americans \\"something authentic to travel by and to make traveling better for the Negro\\".Seiler, p. 90. Its principal goal was to provide accurate information on black-friendly accommodations to answer the constant question that faced black drivers: \\"Where will you spend the night?\\" As well as essential information on lodgings, service stations and garages, it provided details of leisure facilities open to African Americans, including beauty salons, restaurants, nightclubs and country clubs.Seiler, p. 91. The listings focused on four main categories – hotels, motels, tourist homes (private residences, usually owned by African-Americans, which provided accommodation to travelers), and restaurants. They were arranged by state and subdivided by city, giving the name and address of each business. For an extra payment, businesses could have their listing displayed in bold type or have a star next to it to denote that they were \\"recommended\\". Many such establishments were run by and for African-Americans and in some cases were named after prominent figures in African-American history. In North Carolina, such black-owned businesses included the Carver, Lincoln, and Booker T. Washington hotels, the Friendly City beauty parlor, the Black Beauty Tea Room, the New Progressive tailor shop, the Big Buster tavern, and the Blue Duck Inn. Each edition also included feature articles on travel and destinations,Rugh, p. 78. and included a listing of black resorts such as Idlewild, Michigan; Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts; and Belmar, New Jersey.Rugh, p. 168. The state of New Mexico was particularly recommended as a place where most motels would welcome \\"guests on the basis of 'cash rather than color'\\". =Influence= The College View Court-Hotel in Waco, Texas, advertised as \\"Waco's Finest for Negroes\\" in the 1950s The Green Book attracted sponsorship from a number of businesses, including the African-American newspapers Call and Post of Cleveland, and the Louisville Leader of Louisville.Seiler, p. 89. Standard Oil (later Esso) was also a sponsor, owing to the efforts of James \\"Billboard\\" Jackson, a pioneering African-American Esso sales representative. Esso's \\"race group\\", part of its marketing division, promoted the Green Book as enabling Esso's black customers to \\"go further with less anxiety\\". By contrast, Shell gas stations were known to refuse black customers.Lewis, p. 269. The 1949 edition included an Esso endorsement message that told readers: \\"As representatives of the Esso Standard Oil Co., we are pleased to recommend the Green Book for your travel convenience. Keep one on hand each year and when you are planning your trips, let Esso Touring Service supply you with maps and complete routings, and for real 'Happy Motoring' – use Esso Products and Esso Service wherever you find the Esso sign.\\" Photographs of some African-American entrepreneurs who owned Esso gas stations appeared in the pages of the Green Book. Although Green usually refrained from editorializing in the Green Book, he let his readers' letters speak for the influence of his guide. William Smith of Hackensack, New Jersey, described it as a \\"credit to the Negro Race\\" in a letter published in the 1938 edition. He commented: The \\"Colored only\\" Hotel Clark in Memphis, Tennessee, Earl Hutchinson Sr., the father of journalist Earl Ofari Hutchinson, wrote of a 1955 move from Chicago to California that \\"you literally didn't leave home without [the Green Book]\\".Seiler, p. 94. Ernest Green, one of the Little Rock Nine, used the Green Book to navigate the from Arkansas to Virginia in the 1950s and comments that \\"it was one of the survival tools of segregated life\\". According to the civil rights leader Julian Bond, recalling his parents' use of the Green Book, \\"it was a guidebook that told you not where the best places were to eat, but where there was any place\\". Bond comments: While the Green Book was intended to make life easier for those living under Jim Crow, its publisher looked forward to a time when such guidebooks would no longer be necessary. As Green wrote, \\"there will be a day sometime in the near future when this guide will not have to be published. That is when we as a race will have equal opportunities and privileges in the United States. It will be a great day for us to suspend this publication for then we can go as we please, and without embarrassment.\\" Los Angeles is now considering offering special protection to the sites that kept black travelers safe. Ken Bernstein, principal planner for the city's Office of Historic Resources notes, \\"At the very least, these sites can be incorporated into our city's online inventory system. They are part of the story of African Americans in Los Angeles, and the story of Los Angeles itself writ large.\\"'Green Book' sites along Route 66 kept traveling African Americans safe. L.A. is now considering giving those spots special protection. The Los Angeles Times, May 17, 2016.  Publishing history  Sign in Statesboro, Georgia: \\"Colored Motel, 2 blocks\\" The Green Book was published locally in New York, but its popularity was such that from 1937 it was distributed nationally with input from Charles McDowell, a collaborator on Negro affairs for the U.S. Travel Bureau, a government agency. With new editions published annually from 1936 to 1940, the Green Book's publication was suspended during World War II and resumed in 1946.Landry, p. 57. Its scope expanded greatly during its years of publication; from covering only the New York City area in the first edition, it eventually covered facilities in most of the United States and parts of Canada (primarily Montreal), Mexico, and Bermuda. Coverage was good in the eastern United States and weak in Great Plains states such as North Dakota, where there were few black residents. It eventually sold around 15,000 copies per year, distributed by mail order, by black-owned businesses and Esso service stations, some of which—unusual for the oil industry at the time—were franchised to African Americans. It originally sold for 25 cents, increasing to $1.25 by 1957. With the book's growing success, Green retired from the post office and hired a small publishing staff that operated from 200 West 135th Street in Harlem. He also established a vacation reservation service in 1947 to take advantage of the post-war boom in automobile travel. From 10 pages in its first edition, by 1949 he had expanded the Green Book to more than 80 pages, including advertisements. The Green Book was printed by Gibraltar Printing and Publishing Co. The 1951 Green Book recommended that black-owned businesses raise their standards, as travelers were \\"no longer content to pay top prices for inferior accommodations and services\\". The quality of black- owned lodgings was coming under scrutiny, as many prosperous blacks found them to be second-rate compared to the white-owned lodgings from which they were excluded.Rugh, p. 84. In 1952, Green renamed the publication The Negro Travelers' Green Book, in recognition of its coverage of international destinations requiring travel by plane and ship. Although segregation was still in force, by state laws in the South and often by practice elsewhere, the wide circulation of the Green Book had attracted growing interest from white businesses that wanted to tap into the potential sales of the black market. The 1955 edition noted: > A few years after its publication ... white business has also recognized its > [The Green Book’s] value and it is now in use by the Esso Standard Oil Co., > The American Automobile Assn. and its affiliate automobile clubs throughout > the country, other automobile clubs, air lines, travel bureaus, travelers > aid, libraries and thousands of subscribers. By the start of the 1960s, the Green Books market was beginning to erode. Even before the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, African-American civil rights activism was having the effect of lessening racial segregation in public facilities. An increasing number of middle-class African Americans were beginning to question whether guides such as the Green Book were accommodating Jim Crow by steering black travelers to segregated businesses rather than encouraging them to push for equal access. Black-owned motels in remote locations off state highways lost customers to a new generation of integrated interstate motels located near freeway exits. The 1963 Green Book acknowledged that the activism of the civil rights movement had \\"widened the areas of public accommodations accessible to all\\", but it defended the continued listing of black-friendly businesses because \\"a family planning for a vacation hopes for one that is free of tensions and problems\\". The final edition was renamed, now called the Travelers' Green Book: 1966-67 International Edition: For Vacation Without Aggravation; it was the last to be published after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 made the guide effectively obsolete by outlawing racial discrimination in public accommodation.Hinckley, p. 127. That edition included significant changes that reflected the post-Civil Rights Act outlook. As the new title indicated, it was no longer just for the Negro, nor solely for the motorist, as its publishers sought to widen its appeal. Although the content continued to proclaim its mission of highlighting leisure options for black travelers, the cover featured a drawing of a blonde Caucasian woman waterskiing, – a sign of how, as Michael Ra-Shon Hall puts it, \\"the Green Book 'whitened' its surface and internationalized its scope, while still remaining true to its founding mission to ensure the security of African-American travelers both in the U.S. and abroad\\". Representation in other media In the 2000s, academics, artists, curators, and writers exploring the history of African-American travel in the United States during the Jim Crow era revived interest in the Green Book. The result has been a number of projects, books and other works referring to the Green Book. The book itself has acquired a high value as a collectors' item; a \\"partly perished\\" copy of the 1941 edition sold at auction in March 2015 for $22,500.

Death Wish Coffee was introduced in 2012. The company was founded by Mike Brown in Saratoga Springs, New York, and is now headquartered in Ballston Spa, New York. Its production facility is in Round Lake, New York. Death Wish claims that its coffee has double the caffeine of an average cup of coffee, but that it also does not taste bitter or acidic. Death Wish Coffee and Valhalla Java are USDA- certified organic and can be found in more than 10,000 stores across the nation, including Hannaford, Kroger, Price Chopper, Healthy Living Market, ShopRite, Safeway, and Walmart.  List of products  = Death Wish Coffee = Death Wish is a dark roast coffee made with a blend of Arabica and Robusta coffee beans sourced from India and Peru. It claims to contain double the caffeine than an average cup of coffee. Death Wish Coffee is available in whole bean, ground, and single-serve pods. = Valhalla Java Odinforce Blend = Valhalla Java was created with guitarist Zakk Wylde. It's a medium-dark roast blend available in 12-ounce bags in whole bean or ground, in addition to single serve pods. It has nutty and chocolate coffee notes. Beans for Valhalla Java are mainly sourced from Honduras, Guatemala, Sumatra, Peru, and India. = Cauldron Aged Pumpkin = Death Wish Coffee's seasonal Cauldron Aged Pumpkin blend is released in the fall and is available in whole bean and ground. It's made by simmering cardamom, cinnamon, and ginger for about 12 hours. After, unroasted coffee beans are aged in the blend for 10-12 days before it's roasted to a dark roast blend. = Barrel Brand = In collaboration with Albany Distilling Company, Death Wish Coffee periodically releases Barrel Brand blends throughout the year. These blends are made by soaking green coffee in freshly poured oak barrels provided by Albany Distilling Company. The beans are then slow roasted to preserve the liquor flavors. Barrel Brand is made with whiskey, rum, or bourbon and is made in limited batches. = Cold brew coffee = The Death Wish coffee offers three types of cold brew coffee: Unsweetened Black Coffee, Slightly Sweet Black Coffee, and Cream and Sugar Latte. ;Unsweetened Black Coffee The Unsweetened black coffee is roasted in small batches with natural ingredients to make a cold brew coffee that is two times stronger than the average coffee. Since the coffee is unsweetened and devoid of artificial flavoring, each cold brew can has only 15 calories and is packed with 300 mg of caffeine. ;Slightly Sweet Black Coffee The slightly sweet black is another variation of Death Wish cold brew coffee. However, this cold brew coffee is dairy and gluten-free with 35 calories and 300 mg of caffeine per can. It is similar to the unsweetened version, but as the name implies, this one is slightly sweetened. ;Cream and Sugar Latte The cream and sugar latte is made with all natural ingredients and packed with highly caffeinated punch. It is slightly lighter and more sweet than other cold brew coffee flavors offered by Death Wish coffee. The cream and sugar latte comes in 300 mg cans.  Awards and recognition  Death Wish Coffee gained publicity when it was chosen as the winner of Intuit QuickBooks \\"Small Business, Big Game\\" competition in 2015, allowing it to have a Super Bowl commercial carried nationwide free of charge during Super Bowl 50. In 2017, owner and founder Mike Brown was named the EY Entrepreneur of the Year for Emerging Business in New York. Mike Brown was also named a 2018 40 Under 40 by the Albany Business Review. ;Coffee To The International Space Station On June 29th, 2018, Death Wish Coffee sent an instant, freeze-dried, version of its coffee to the international space station aboard the Falcon 9 SpaceX rocket with the Dragon Capsule. The coffee arrived the station on July 2nd, 2018. The Coffee company once again sent black coffee into three tubes with airtight clamps called MixStix into the space in June 2019 as a part of partnership with iLEAD and DreamUp – a provider of space-based educational opportunities. The purpose was to test whether black coffee kills a particular bacteria found in teeth plaque in micro-gravity in the same way as it does on Earth.  Social Responsibility  Death Wish Coffee partners with different non-profit and social organizations to sponsor events, social causes and more. ;Special Olympics New York Special Olympics New York is a non-profit sports organization for children and adults with intellectual and physical disabilities.

Williams was the first black woman to run for the California State Assembly in 1948 on the Progressive Ticket and served on the boards of the Screen Actors Guild, Actors' Lab, and Actors Equity. She represented the World Peace Council at the first Angola Independence Celebration in 1975, and co-founded the Art Against Apartheid Movement in Los Angeles in the 1980s.  Early life  Williams was born Frances Elizabeth Jones on September 17, 1908, in East Orange, New Jersey, to William Henry Jones and Elizabeth Nelson Jones, the youngest of three children. Her father drove a delivery wagon, and her mother was a laundress. Shortly after moving to Pittsburgh, William Jones died. Her mother, Elizabeth, met and married Ben Williams, a policeman; the family moved to Cleveland, Ohio. While still in high school, Williams got a job as director of activities at the Central Avenue Bath House. Down the street from the Bath House was the Playhouse Settlement founded by Russell and Rowena Jelliffe, who graduated with their masters in social work from Oberlin College. Williams began working at the Playhouse Settlement. She became the Settlement’s first resident worker and lived there fourteen years until she left to study theater in the Soviet Union. Part of the Settlement House was for recreational activity for the young including a children’s theater started by Rowena Jelliffe and later an adult theater. Williams began writing and directing some of the plays performed in the children’s theater and later in the adult theater she performed with Hazel Mountain Walker, John Marriott and others. In 1922, after a visit from Charles Gilpin, the Dumas Dramatic Club changed its name to the Gilpin Players in his honor. In 1927 the name of the theater was changed to Karamu House, a Swahili word for central meeting place. In 1932, Williams married George Ferguson, a man she’d known a number of years. The marriage lasted one year. She remained for fourteen years at Karamu House, taking part in eighty-five productions, writing and directing plays, making costumes, and designing sets, On the suggestion of her friend Langston Hughes, and the encouragement from playwright Friedrich Wolf who wrote \\"Sailors of Cattaro,\\" she went to the Soviet Union to study theater. In 1934, Soviet theater was known for its outstanding productions by actor and director Vsevolod Meyerhold, directors Constantin Stanislavski, Elanskaya, Natalya Sats, Moskvin, and Kachaov. Williams studied at the Moscow Children’s Theatre run by Natalya Sats and attended many of the theater productions in Moscow. After two years in Moscow, her passport having expired, she went to Helsinki, Finland to renew it. In 1936, political tensions in Europe were at its height. She found a job working at a travel agency and stayed in Finland for several months. Because of her friendship with the daughter of playwright Hella Wuolijoki, she was introduced to Ingmar Bergman and other writers and was invited to Marleback, a favorite meeting place of politicians and literary people including Bertolt Brecht. Williams felt the time she spent in Helsinki taught her more about politics than at any time before. In 1939 Williams married William Anthony Hill, social worker, who, according to an article in Ebony magazine, \\"Ceramics by Tony Hill,\\" (Vol. 2, Nov. 1946, pp. 3–35) became known as one of the best ceramists on the West coast. In 1941, they moved to Los Angeles, California. Together they did many cultural things together such as organize an exhibit for the art of Jacob Lawrence, the first formal exhibition of its kind in Los Angeles; and one for Charles White. When Katherine Dunham brought her troupe to L.A. from Chicago, Williams put together a road tour for her. When Waters went on a road tour for Mamba’s Daughter, Waters hired her as her assistant. Waters convinced the producers to offer Williams the part as her understudy.  Acting career  Actress, director, theatre producer, theatre owner, union organizer and arts advocate, Williams was a pivotal force in the arts community for more than seventy years. Author Bill Reed, in his book Hot From Harlem: Profiles in Classic African-American Entertainment, dedicates an entire chapter to her career. He shares that Paul Robeson noted her \\"complete artistic contributions and integrity\\" in his inscription when autographing his autobiography, Here I Stand. Shortly after her return from Europe, Williams moved to New York City and soon joined the cast of You Can't Take It with You. The company went on tour across the U.S. for two years. After the tour, Williams returned to New York and became active in the newly formed Negro Actors Guild organized by Noble Sissle and Leigh Whipper. Among its members were Fredi Washington, executive director; Edna Thomas, executive secretary; Ethel Waters, Bill Robinson, Louis Armstrong, J. Rosamond Johnson, and Rev. Adam Clayton Powell. Williams had met many of them when they visited Karamu House. Williams appeared in two of Oscar Micheaux’s films, Lying Lips, 1939, and The Notorious Elinor Lee, 1940. She continued her training at Actor’s Lab and was on their executive board. What frustrated her most was she was never given the opportunity to play a lead role; instead she worked as stage manager, on lights, sets, and costumes. In addition, she worked with Charlie Chaplin at Circle Theater in the Round and at the Cosmos Theater in Hollywood. In 1946, her first Hollywood film role was as Amy in Magnificent Doll with David Niven and Ginger Rogers. In 1949, she worked with James Mason and Joan Bennett in The Reckless Moment. This was followed in 1951 by Show Boat with Katherine Grayson, Howard Keel, Ava Gardner, and William Warfield. While she appeared on stage, in over forty films, on television shows in minor roles, and in commercials, it wasn't until 1987, she was hired to play the role of Miss Marie in a new comedy-drama series, Frank's Place starring Tim Reid. Produced by Reed and Hugh Wilson, and set in New Orleans, it featured an integrated cast of veteran actors. Williams played \\"Miss Marie, waitress emeritus.\\" Each episode contained plausible plots capturing the folk experiences of African Americans in New Orleans. Despite being well received by many fans and critics, it was cancelled after one season (1987–1988). A few weeks into the season, Nielsen ratings reflected a drop in viewership. The fact that CBS moved the show around a lot, changing its time slot and shuffling the night it came on was a contributing factor.  Personal life and activism  After nine years of marriage, in 1948, Williams and Hill were divorced. Being a member of Actors' Equity, she became actively involved with progressive people. She was part of the Homeowners Protective Association organized by Charlotta Bass, publisher and editor of The California Eagle, a major newspaper in the community. That same year, Williams became the first black woman to run for the California State Assembly for the 63rd District on the Progressive ticket. As a trade unionist, Williams served on the board of the National Negro Labor Council (NNLC) and with her friend Paul Robeson, on October 27, 1951 she attended their first convention in Cincinnati. Among the unions represented were delegates from the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers, the United Packinghouse Workers, and the Food, Tobacco, Agricultural, and Allied Workers Union. Eventually the NNLC was labeled \\"subversive\\" and \\"Communist- dominated\\" and a \\"tool of the Soviet Union.\\" and was investigated by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). In the early 1950s, with the growing popularity of television, several unions in the entertainment industry including Chorus Equity, the American Guild of Variety Artists, the American Guild of Musical Artists, and Actors' Equity formed the Television Authority (TVA). The TVA was a forerunner to the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA). Two representatives from each union were included on the board. Williams was on the board of the TVA representing Actors' Equity. With the onslaught of the McCarthy era, Actors Equity and TVA were under attack. Because she was a progressive and had refused to sign the loyalty oath, she was asked to resign from the board. On June 20, 1952, Williams delivered her resignation speech to the committee. As a result of her work on the board, ethnic actors were able to get more work albeit as extras. After her resignation, a year would pass before she worked in film again. During the 1950s, at a time when Senator Joseph McCarthy and HUAC sought to rid the film industry of anyone considered progressive or left-leaning, many in the industry were blacklisted. Several of Hollywood blacklisted members formed a film production company. Among them were Herbert Biberman, Paul Jarrico, Albert Maltz, Michael Wilson, and Adrian Scott. Williams was asked to participate on one of their projects. She was hired as Assistant Director on the film Salt of the Earth (uncredited). She helped to cast the film and worked with the actors and non actors, representing them in their grievances, but because she was working on a film in Hollywood, she had to leave. Despite the problems encountered not only from the government, but also from the production heads, it was a landmark picture. She was enormously proud. In the 1960s, with a bleeding ulcer, Williams along with her brother Bill, moved to Mazatlan, Mexico where they lived for nine years until Bill died. It was close enough to Hollywood so she could fly back and forth with little trouble. In 1975, Williams was a delegate to the World Women's Conference in East Berlin, East Germany, and in November of that year she attended the first independence day celebration in Angola, Africa as the only American representative. A year later (1976) she attended the World Peace Council in Athens, Greece. In 1978 Williams served as chairperson of the National Anti-Imperialist Movement in Solidarity with African Liberation (NAIMSAL), Los Angeles office. From 1975–1989, Williams co-founded Art Against Apartheid and along with other artists and entertainers performed in schools around Los Angeles educating students about Apartheid in South Africa.  Death  Williams died on January 2, 1995. She had been hospitalized following complications from a stroke she suffered in September, shortly after her 89 birthday. The Frances E. Williams Artist Grants [FEWAG] was established, as directed by Williams in her will, providing funds for Blacks in the arts \\"to take classes to perfect their craft.\\" Between 2005 - 2014, $229,000 was dispensed in small grants to individual artists and arts organizations. Williams' papers are housed at the Southern California Library for Social Studies and Research in Los Angeles.  Awards and honors  Frances E.

The character is also a journalist. Games =Main series= The game displays the health bar, the level, the number of zombies killed, depleting bars telling how much time until each mission becomes unavailable, and the current item (which turns red when the weapon is about to break). The games work within a 72-hour schedule which happens in an in-game time, every event happens within a specific hour. The story happens within a city infected by hordes of zombies and various hostile survivors, and each subsequent game has allowed for more zombies to be displayed on screen, at the same time. The melee combat system consists of using everything as a weapon, most of the items in the game can be used, as some weapons are very effective, but others are comedically inefficient, in addition weapons constantly break forcing the player to constantly use different weapons. Dead Rising 2 introduced a \\"Combo Weapons\\" system, where the player can combine certain items into more powerful weapons, some of which are over-the-top, such as a lightsaber, made by combining a flashlight with jewelry. Dead Rising 3 enhanced the mechanic by introducing \\"Combo Vehicles\\" allowing players to combine items with vehicles and even vehicles with other vehicles to make more powerful vehicles, for instance a motorcycle with a chainsaw creates the \\"slicecycle\\", a motorcycle with two chainsaws at the sides. Players can level up by performing mission objectives, which consist of progressing on the main story, rescuing and leading survivors to safety by guiding them to the safe house, and also fighting psychopaths whom are civilians who either have become criminally insane after the zombie outbreak or are taking advantage of it for their own purposes. Leveling up increases the health bar, walking speed, unlocks melee combos, and reveals weapon combinations. Customization allows the player to use different clothes, spread all around the mall, which vary from a sports fan attire, to pajamas, to dresses, to a male stripper outfit, to a Megaman cosplay. All games feature multiple endings, completing all the missions in the main story is the only way to get the true ending. Since the second game, all games except for Dead Rising 4 feature two player co-op online multiplayer in the story mode, with the fourth main game only including a competitive multiplayer mode. Dead Rising (2006) The first game in the Dead Rising series. The game centers on Frank West, a photojournalist who ends up trapped in a shopping mall in the fictional town of Willamette, Colorado, that is infested with zombies. Players can use everything as a weapon. The game story works in a 72-hour clock, with another in-universe 24 hour post game chapter. In total, there are six endings, titled F through A, with Ending A being the only one to unlock the aforementioned post-game; rendering it the game's canon finale. Dead Rising 2 (2010) The second game in the Dead Rising series. Set in the fictional casino town of Fortune City, Nevada, five years after the events of Dead Rising, the game follows former motocross champion Chuck Greene trying to clear his name after being framed for starting the outbreak in Fortune City, while simultaneously trying to keep his infected daughter alive with \\"Zombrex\\", a drug that lags the zombification process. The \\"72-hour\\" system returns. The major gameplay improvement over its predecessor is the Combo Weapons system, allowing Chuck to combine certain items by using crafting tables, in addition survivors AI was also improved. The Main story can be played in 2 player online co-op, with the second player controlling a second Chuck. Players can earn money by playing the online multiplayer mode \\"Terror is Reality\\". *Standalone downloadable games: Two downloadable standalone expansions were released for the game, for Xbox 360. Since March 2017, both are retro compatible with Xbox One, although unlike the main game, none of the expansions were remastered.:http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2017/03/02/dead-rising- cars-2-meet-the-robinsons-backward-compatible-xbox-one.aspx The first Case Zero (2010): Released a month before the main game, Dead Rising 2: Case Zero serves as a prologue to the main game. Set a few years before Dead Rising 2, Chuck Greene is stranded in a small town named Still Creek and has to fight his way out with his daughter Katey. While the second, Case West (2010): The downloadable content serves as an epilogue for Dead Rising 2, Chuck with the help of Frank West, go to a Phenotrans facility to get evidence to clear Chuck's name. Dead Rising 3 (2013) The third game in the Dead Rising series. Set ten years after Dead Rising 2, the story follows a young mechanic named Nick Ramos and his attempt to survive a massive zombie outbreak in the fictional city of Los Perdidos, California. The time system returns. Combo Weapons can be fused anywhere, as crafting tables were removed, and the crafting system was also expanded by introducing \\"Combo-Vehicles\\". While there is no sandbox mode, like in \\"Off the Record\\", similar challenges can be found during the Story Mode. Survivors were upgraded to be able to use \\"Combo Weapons\\". Like in the previous game, the main story can be played in 2 player Co-op Online Mode where the second player controls a character named Dick. *Downloadable content: There are 5 downloadable content packs, the first 4 are known as Untold Stories of Los Perdidos.

It focuses on beat 'em up action with four-player co-op, in it players can control Frank West, Chuck Greene, Katey \\"Annie\\" Greene and Nick Ramos, it also features exclusive costumes which serve as an homage to other Capcom franchises. Dead Rising 4 (2016) The fourth game in the Dead Rising series. Set one year after Dead Rising 3, the game features an older Frank West, returning to Willamette, Colorado during the Christmas season, where the newly constructed \\"Willamette Memorial Megaplex\\" has fallen under another zombie outbreak. \\"Combo Weapons\\" and \\"Combo Vehicles\\" return, and camera mechanics from \\"Dead Rising 2: Off the Record\\" also return improved. The game introduces an exo-suit. Unlike previous games, the 72-hour timer system has been dropped, to encourage exploration. The main story does not support online cooperative multiplayer, making it a single player experience like in the original game. To address player complaints of the game being too easy, a month after its release Capcom released an update which added the much requested Hard and Ultra-Hard difficulties, in which the items break more easily and the food restores less health, bringing the difficulty closer to that of the previous games, five new Street Fighter themed costumes were also included within the update. A further update was released on December 5, upgrading the game with a new game mode called Capcom Heroes, the new mode allows Frank to don 17 new outfits based on Capcom's video game franchises, each with their own moveset. There is four player cooperative play, but it does not feature Frank West, as it features four characters from the main story and the cooperative mode is separate from the story. The cooperative mode has the player completing various tasks in the Willamette Memorial Megaplex, while working as a team, and earning scores by doing various tasks (e.g. kill zombies, plant bombs, etc.). The player must survive until 9 pm that night and make it back to the safe room. *Downloadable content: Three add-ons were confirmed within the game's season pass: the Stocking Stuffer Holiday Pack only added holiday themed weapons, while the multiplayer Super Ultra Dead Rising 4 Mini Golf added a mini golf multiplayer mode. Released in April 2017, the third and sole story DLC titled Frank Rising, continued the story after the end of the main game, picking up right after its ending, with an infected Frank West, trying to prevent his own zombification and helping survivors. The gameplay is rumored to involve the return of the timer mechanic and have a higher difficulty than that of the main game.http://www.gameinformer.com/themes/blogs/generic/post.aspx?WeblogApp=news&y;=2016&m;=10&d;=19&WeblogPostName;=dead- rising-4-season-pass-detailed&GroupKeys;= =Remakes= Dead Rising: Chop Till You Drop (2009) A reimagining of the original Dead Rising for the Wii. This version was built with the same engine used for the Resident Evil 4 Wii Edition. While still set in a mall and able to save survivors, there is a greater emphasis on firearms and the game is structured around individual timed missions instead of free roam. Various elements were tailored to the Wii's weaker hardware or limitations of the different engine. These included smaller maps, reduced enemy counts and the removal of the photo system, but new enemy types were added. Dead Rising 2: Off the Record (2011) A non-canonical remake of Dead Rising 2, which replaces protagonist Chuck Greene, with Frank West (the protagonist of the original game), and also features some slight plot alterations. Fortune City remains mostly the same, but now adds a new place, a small alien thematic park called \\"Uranus Zone\\". The \\"72-hour\\" system returns, but the game also adds a \\"Sandbox Mode\\", where Frank can explore Fortune City without a time limit, and also complete challenges which require the players to use their creativity and crafting the necessary weapons to succeed. More Combo Weapons were added. Camera mechanics from Dead Rising also returned improved. Both the main story and the sandbox mode can be played in two player co-operative online mode, with the second player controlling Chuck. =Re-release compilations= Dead Rising Collection (2014) Dead Rising Collection is a compilation for Xbox 360 containing the games from the Dead Rising franchise released on Xbox 360: Dead Rising, Dead Rising 2 and its downloadable content Case Zero and Case West, and Dead Rising 2: Off the Record.

Built in 1911, the building was designed by prominent California architect Julia Morgan and originally located on the central campus of the University of California, Berkeley, near the present location of the Haas School of Business. It served as a gathering place for Berkeley's female students, who wanted a female counterpart to Senior Hall, the senior men's meeting hall.  History  Berkeley's female students began planning the hall in 1909 and raised money for the building between 1909 and 1911. The building was first called Girton Hall during this period; the name came from Girton College at the University of Cambridge, which was the first women's residential college in England. When the building opened in 1911, its name changed to Senior Women's Hall. The hall gave women's groups at Berkeley a place to meet and represented a significant step toward gender equality at the university. In 1940, the building was moved 160 feet west to make room for a street extension. In 1969, it became a campus child care center, and its name was changed back to Girton Hall to acknowledge its history, even though the name had never been applied to the building after its construction. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. In 2014, to make way for an expansion of the Haas School of Business, the child care center moved to another location near the university campus, and Girton Hall was cut into four pieces, moved to the UC Botanical Garden, and reassembled. The name of the building was changed to Julia Morgan Hall, and it re-opened to the public in 2015.

After receiving no Division I college scholarship offers, he opted to attend a year of prep school at Worcester Academy. He was recruited by coach Bob McKillop after his prep school year. At Davidson, Winters became a four-year starter and one of the top players in the Southern Conference (SoCon). He averaged 12.4 points per game as a freshman in 2002–03, then raised his average to 17.8 as a sophomore. In that sophomore season, Winters was named to the All-Southern Conference team. Winters' junior season was a special one for both him and the Davidson Wildcats. The team went a perfect 16–0 in the SoCon and Winters was named conference player of the year by both the conference media and coaches. As a senior, Winters and Davidson were not able to replicate their perfect season of the year before, but they earned a bid to the 2006 NCAA Tournament by winning the SoCon Tournament, with Winters winning MVP honors. Following the end of his college career, Winters went undrafted in the 2006 NBA draft. He went to France to play for Nantes of the LNB Pro B, averaging 15.4 points per game for the season. He then spent the next three seasons in Germany with Bayer Giants Leverkusen, and was named a Bundesliga All-Star in 2010.

Flow plasticity is a solid mechanics theory that is used to describe the plastic behavior of materials. Flow plasticity theories are characterized by the assumption that a flow rule exists that can be used to determine the amount of plastic deformation in the material. In flow plasticity theories it is assumed that the total strain in a body can be decomposed additively (or multiplicatively) into an elastic part and a plastic part. The elastic part of the strain can be computed from a linear elastic or hyperelastic constitutive model. However, determination of the plastic part of the strain requires a flow rule and a hardening model.  Small deformation theory  Stress-strain curve showing typical plastic behavior of materials in uniaxial compression. The strain can be decomposed into a recoverable elastic strain (\\\\varepsilon_e) and an inelastic strain (\\\\varepsilon_p). The stress at initial yield is \\\\sigma_0. For strain hardening materials (as shown in the figure) the yield stress increases with increasing plastic deformation to a value of \\\\sigma_y. Typical flow plasticity theories for unidirectional loading (for small deformation perfect plasticity or hardening plasticity) are developed on the basis of the following requirements: # The material has a linear elastic range. # The material has an elastic limit defined as the stress at which plastic deformation first takes place, i.e., \\\\sigma = \\\\sigma_0. # Beyond the elastic limit the stress state always remains on the yield surface, i.e., \\\\sigma = \\\\sigma_y. # Loading is defined as the situation under which increments of stress are greater than zero, i.e., d\\\\sigma > 0. If loading takes the stress state to the plastic domain then the increment of plastic strain is always greater than zero, i.e., d\\\\varepsilon_p > 0. # Unloading is defined as the situation under which increments of stress are less than zero, i.e., d\\\\sigma < 0. The material is elastic during unloading and no additional plastic strain is accumulated. # The total strain is a linear combination of the elastic and plastic parts, i.e., d\\\\varepsilon = d\\\\varepsilon_e + d\\\\varepsilon_p. The plastic part cannot be recovered while the elastic part is fully recoverable. # The work done of a loading-unloading cycle is positive or zero, i.e., d\\\\sigma\\\\,d\\\\varepsilon = d\\\\sigma\\\\,(d\\\\varepsilon_e + d\\\\varepsilon_p) \\\\ge 0. This is also called the Drucker stability postulate and eliminates the possibility of strain softening behavior. The above requirements can be expressed in three dimensional states of stress and multidirectional loading as follows. * Elasticity (Hooke's law). In the linear elastic regime the stresses and strains in the material are related by ::: \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} = \\\\mathsf{D}:\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon} :::where the stiffness matrix \\\\mathsf{D} is constant. * Elastic limit (Yield surface). The elastic limit is defined by a yield surface that does not depend on the plastic strain and has the form ::: f(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}) = 0 \\\\,. * Beyond the elastic limit. For strain hardening materials, the yield surface evolves with increasing plastic strain and the elastic limit changes. The evolving yield surface has the form ::: f(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}_p) = 0 \\\\,. * Loading. For general states of stress, plastic loading is indicated if the state of stress is on the yield surface and the stress increment is directed toward the outside of the yield surface; this occurs if the inner product of the stress increment and the outward normal of the yield surface is positive, i.e., ::: d\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}:\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}} \\\\ge 0 \\\\,. :::The above equation, when it is equal to zero, indicates a state of neutral loading where the stress state moves along the yield surface. * Unloading: A similar argument is made for unloading for which situation f < 0 , the material is in the elastic domain, and ::: d\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}:\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}} < 0 \\\\,. * Strain decomposition: The additive decomposition of the strain into elastic and plastic parts can be written as ::: d\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon} = d\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}_e + d\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}_p \\\\,. * Stability postulate: The stability postulate is expressed as ::: d\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}:d\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon} \\\\ge 0 \\\\,. = Flow rule = In metal plasticity, the assumption that the plastic strain increment and deviatoric stress tensor have the same principal directions is encapsulated in a relation called the flow rule. Rock plasticity theories also use a similar concept except that the requirement of pressure- dependence of the yield surface requires a relaxation of the above assumption. Instead, it is typically assumed that the plastic strain increment and the normal to the pressure-dependent yield surface have the same direction, i.e., : d\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}_p = d\\\\lambda\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}} where d\\\\lambda > 0 is a hardening parameter. This form of the flow rule is called an associated flow rule and the assumption of co- directionality is called the normality condition. The function f is also called a plastic potential. The above flow rule is easily justified for perfectly plastic deformations for which d\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} = 0 when d\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}_p > 0, i.e., the yield surface remains constant under increasing plastic deformation. This implies that the increment of elastic strain is also zero, d\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}_e = 0, because of Hooke's law. Therefore, : d\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}:\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}} = 0 \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad d\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}:d\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}_p = 0 \\\\,. Hence, both the normal to the yield surface and the plastic strain tensor are perpendicular to the stress tensor and must have the same direction. For a work hardening material, the yield surface can expand with increasing stress. We assume Drucker's second stability postulate which states that for an infinitesimal stress cycle this plastic work is positive, i.e., : d\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}: d\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}_p \\\\ge 0 \\\\,. The above quantity is equal to zero for purely elastic cycles. Examination of the work done over a cycle of plastic loading-unloading can be used to justify the validity of the associated flow rule.Anandarajah (2010). = Consistency condition = The Prager consistency condition is needed to close the set of constitutive equations and to eliminate the unknown parameter d\\\\lambda from the system of equations. The consistency condition states that df = 0 at yield because f(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma},\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}_p) = 0 , and hence : df = \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}}:d\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}_p}:d\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}_p = 0 \\\\,.  Large deformation theory  Large deformation flow theories of plasticity typically start with one of the following assumptions: * the rate of deformation tensor can be additively decomposed into an elastic part and a plastic part, or * the deformation gradient tensor can be multiplicatively decomposed in an elastic part and a plastic part. The first assumption was widely used for numerical simulations of metals but has gradually been superseded by the multiplicative theory. = Kinematics of multiplicative plasticity = The concept of multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into elastic and plastic parts was first proposed independently by B. A. Bilby, E. Kröner, in the context of crystal plasticity and extended to continuum plasticity by Erasmus Lee. The decomposition assumes that the total deformation gradient (F) can be decomposed as: : \\\\boldsymbol{F} = \\\\boldsymbol{F}^e\\\\cdot\\\\boldsymbol{F}^p where Fe is the elastic (recoverable) part and Fp is the plastic (unrecoverable) part of the deformation. The spatial velocity gradient is given by : : \\\\begin{align} \\\\boldsymbol{l} & = \\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{F}}\\\\cdot\\\\boldsymbol{F}^{-1} = \\\\left(\\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{F}}^e\\\\cdot\\\\boldsymbol{F}^p + \\\\boldsymbol{F}^e\\\\cdot\\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{F}}^p\\\\right)\\\\cdot \\\\left[(\\\\boldsymbol{F}^p)^{-1}\\\\cdot(\\\\boldsymbol{F}^e)^{-1}\\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{F}}^e\\\\cdot(\\\\boldsymbol{F}^e)^{-1} + \\\\boldsymbol{F}^e\\\\cdot[\\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{F}}^p\\\\cdot (\\\\boldsymbol{F}^p)^{-1}]\\\\cdot(\\\\boldsymbol{F}^e)^{-1} \\\\,. \\\\end{align} where a superposed dot indicates a time derivative. We can write the above as : \\\\boldsymbol{l} = \\\\boldsymbol{l}^e + \\\\boldsymbol{F}^e\\\\cdot\\\\boldsymbol{L}^p\\\\cdot(\\\\boldsymbol{F}^e)^{-1} \\\\,. The quantity : \\\\boldsymbol{L}^p := \\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{F}}^p\\\\cdot (\\\\boldsymbol{F}^p)^{-1} is called a plastic velocity gradient and is defined in an intermediate (incompatible) stress-free configuration. The symmetric part (Dp) of Lp is called the plastic rate of deformation while the skew- symmetric part (Wp) is called the plastic spin: : \\\\boldsymbol{D}^p = \\\\tfrac{1}{2}[\\\\boldsymbol{L}^p +(\\\\boldsymbol{L}^p)^T] ~,~~ \\\\boldsymbol{W}^p = \\\\tfrac{1}{2}[\\\\boldsymbol{L}^p -(\\\\boldsymbol{L}^p)^T] \\\\,. Typically, the plastic spin is ignored in most descriptions of finite plasticity. = Elastic regime = The elastic behavior in the finite strain regime is typically described by a hyperelastic material model. The elastic strain can be measured using an elastic right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor defined as: : \\\\boldsymbol{C}^e := (\\\\boldsymbol{F}^e)^T\\\\cdot\\\\boldsymbol{F}^e \\\\,. The logarithmic or Hencky strain tensor may then be defined as : \\\\boldsymbol{E}^e := \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\ln\\\\boldsymbol{C}^e \\\\,. The symmetrized Mandel stress tensor is a convenient stress measure for finite plasticity and is defined as : \\\\boldsymbol{M} := \\\\tfrac{1}{2}(\\\\boldsymbol{C}^e\\\\cdot\\\\boldsymbol{S} + \\\\boldsymbol{S}\\\\cdot\\\\boldsymbol{C}^e) where S is the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress. A possible hyperelastic model in terms of the logarithmic strain is : \\\\boldsymbol{M} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{E}^e} = J\\\\,\\\\frac{dU}{dJ} + 2\\\\mu\\\\,\\\\text{dev}(\\\\boldsymbol{E}^e) where W is a strain energy density function, J = det(F), μ is a modulus, and \\"dev\\" indicates the deviatoric part of a tensor. = Flow rule = Application of the Clausius- Duhem inequality leads, in the absence of a plastic spin, to the finite strain flow rule : \\\\boldsymbol{D}^p = \\\\dot{\\\\lambda}\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{M}} \\\\,. = Loading-unloading conditions = The loading- unloading conditions can be shown to be equivalent to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions : \\\\dot{\\\\lambda} \\\\ge 0 ~,~~ f \\\\le 0~,~~ \\\\dot{\\\\lambda}\\\\,f = 0 \\\\,. = Consistency condition = The consistency condition is identical to that for the small strain case, : \\\\dot{\\\\lambda}\\\\,\\\\dot{f} = 0 \\\\,.

He is a New Democratic member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario who was elected in a 2013 by-election. He represents the riding of Windsor—Tecumseh. Background Hatfield was born in St. Martins, New Brunswick. As an army brat, he frequently moved, living in Fort Churchill, Manitoba, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Oromocto, New Brunswick, St. John's, Newfoundland, Port Alberni, British Columbia, and Pembroke, Ontario. It was in Pembroke, Ontario where he started a broadcast career at CHOV radio and television in 1974. Hatfield then worked in radio and television in St. John's, Newfoundland and Leamington, Ontario. He worked as a weekend reporter with the Windsor Star before joining CBC radio in Windsor as a local reporter. In 1978, he transferred to CBC television in Windsor. For the most part of his career he has been a reporter, although he also spent time as an announcer, writer, and producer. Hatfield was part of the Windsor Experiment which introduced multi-skilling and cross-skilling to CBC operations. Reporters started shooting their own television stories, and camera operators were trained as reporters - becoming video journalists. Although he covered the education and automotive beats, most of his time with CBC Television was spent as Windsor's Municipal Affairs Reporter. For many years he hosted a popular segment called “Percy’s Political Panel” where many up and coming would-be politicians got their first notice in the public eye. Some went on to get elected at the municipal, provincial and federal levels. Hatfield was heavily involved with his union while working at the CBC. Initially, it was the old Canadian Wire Service Guild, the CWSG, where besides serving as a local Shop Steward he served ten years on his National Executive. The CWSG was a Local of The Newspaper Guild, (TNG) based in Washington DC. Hatfield was elected as the national Secretary of the CWSG and the Chair of the Canadian District Council of the Newspaper Guild. The CWSG evolved into the Canadian Media Guild and he was elected Vice-President for Central Canada then elected At-Large as a member of the International Executive Board (the I.E.B.) of the Newspaper Guild, the first Canadian ever elected to an “at large” position with the Guild. Soon after, TNG merged with and became a Sector within the Communications Workers of America, (the CWA) based in Washington DC. After three terms as an “At Large” member, the I.E.B. was downsized, dropping the “At Large” positions and Hatfield went on to serve two terms as the Easter Canadian Vice-President of the TNG/CWA. In 2000, he was given the rare honour of being recognized by his Union with the CMG's Meritorious Service Award. It is something he is most proud of, and the award hangs in his office at the Provincial Parliament in Toronto. “In recognition of his extraordinary commitment and outstanding contribution to the Canadian Wire Service Guild and the growth of the Canadian Media Guild. For twenty years he has given his time, effort and considerable expertise. As a consensus - builder he has helped build a solid foundation for the Canadian Media Guild upon which we can forge future successes.” Hatfield holds a bachelor's degree in Political Science from the University of Windsor. He and Gale were married in 1975, raised two children and now are the proud “Grammy and Poppy” to six beautiful grandchildren, four girls and two boys. Politics When he retired from the CBC in August 2006 he wasted no time in getting involved in municipal politics. That fall he was elected to the first of two terms as a City Councillor in Windsor. As a Councillor Hatfield served two terms on the National Board of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) and was elected three times to the board of the Association of Municipalities of Ontario (AMO). In 2011, Hatfield served as an AMO Chair of the Large Urban Caucus. He has served on numerous City of Windsor and Agency committees including the AMO Host Committee, Arena Board, Armouries Reuse Committee, CAO Performance Review Committee, Clean City Committee, Council Support Services Review Committee, Development Charges Task Force, Environmental Master Plan Implementation Committee, Essex Region Conservation Authority, Heritage Committee, International Relations Committee, Museum Facility Steering Committee, Olde Riverside BIA, Planning & Economic Development Standing Committee, Planning Advisory Committee, Public Health Unit, Roseland Golf Club Board of Directors, Social Development Standing Committee, Solid Waste Authority, Tourism Windsor - Transitional Board, Transit Windsor Board of Directors, War Memorial Committee, WFCU Steering Committee, Windsor BIA Advisory Committee, Windsor Essex Community Housing Corporation Board, Windsor Essex County Health Unit, Windsor Essex Environment Committee, Windsor Licensing Commission, and the Windsor Public Library Board. Hatfield was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in a by-election on August 1, 2013, as the New Democratic candidate in the riding of Windsor—Tecumseh. He defeated Progressive Conservative candidate Robert De Verteuil by 10,544 votes. He was re-elected in the 2014 provincial election defeating Liberal Jason Dupuis by 17,221 votes. Hatfield was re-elected in the 2018 provincial election, defeating Progressive Conservative candidate Mohammad Latif by 13,546 votes. His previous critic roles include Infrastructure, Environment and Climate Change, and Municipal Affairs and Housing. Currently, Hatfield holds the critic role of OLG and Horse Racing, as well as the position of Second Deputy Speaker of the Committee of the Whole House. In this position, Hatfield was asked by Speaker Ted Arnott to be Ontario's representative on the Executive Committee of the Council of State Governments (CSG). The CSG is a region-based forum that fosters the exchange of insights and ideas to help state and provincial officials shape public policy. Hatfield's appointment was the first time that the Legislative Assembly of Ontario was offered a seat on the CSG Executive Committee. He was also appointed by Speaker Arnott to serve as a member of the Midwest-Canada Relations Committee for the Midwestern Legislative Conference. This committee provides a forum for the exchange of ideas and consideration of mutual concerns, and has explored subjects ranging from border security, energy, and most recently trade-related issues and the future of Canada – US relations. In December 2017, he introduced the bill Poet Laureate of Ontario Act In Memory of Gord Downie to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario; it passed in December 2019, establishing the Poet Laureate of Ontario. =Electoral record= References External links * Category:1948 births Category:CBC Television people Category:Canadian radio reporters and correspondents Category:Canadian television reporters and correspondents Category:Living people Category:Ontario New Democratic Party MPPs Category:People from Saint John County, New Brunswick Category:University of Windsor alumni Category:Windsor, Ontario city councillors Category:21st- century Canadian politicians ","title":"Percy Hatfield"},{"id":"40132773","text":"Bánh giầy Bánh giầy (it can also be written as\\"Bánh giầy\\" hay \\"bánh dầy\\"?

Instead, he and his wife and their children chose the countryside where they farmed the land. One day, toward the end of the year, the emperor met with all his sons. He told them whoever brought him the most special and unusual food would be made the new emperor. Almost immediately, the princes left for their homes and started looking for the most delicious food to offer the emperor. Some went hunting in the forests and brought home birds and animals which they prepared into the most palatable dishes.

Neither the rough sea nor the violent weather could stop them from looking for the best gifts to please the emperor.

Although it was first named in 1900, Gekkonomorpha was not widely used as a formal taxon until it was given a phylogenetic definition in the 1990s. Under this definition, Gekkonomorpha is a stem-based taxon containing the node-based taxon Gekkota, the group that includes the last common ancestor of all living geckos and its descendants. The extent of Gekkonomorpha beyond gekkotans differs between studies. For example, Lee (1998) defined Gekkonomorpha in such a way that it included not only Gekkota but the legless amphisbaenian and dibamid lizards as well. The phylogenetic analysis of Conrad (2008), which did not support a close relationship between geckos and legless lizards, used Gekkonomorpha in a much more restrictive sense so that it included only Gekkota and a few extinct lizards more closely related to Gekkota than to any other living group of lizards (making them \\"stem\\" gekkotans). Some of the most recent phylogenetic analyses suggest that the extinct lizards Gobekko and Parviraptor may be stem gekkotans, although other analyses find that Gobekko may instead be within Gekkota and Parviraptor outside Gekkonomorpha.

The band consisted of Dave Hearn (keyboards, vocals), Larry Adams (drums), Frank Wiewel (bass, lead vocals), Kirk Kaufman (guitar, vocals) and Dave Steen (guitar, vocals). They released two albums on Columbia Records - Hawks (rel. 3/81, NJC 36922) and 30 Seconds Over Otho (rel. 7/82, ARC 38058) − while they were together. A third album, Perfect World Radio (Not Lame Recordings), was released posthumously and was made up of tracks the group had been working on after the second album's release. A cassette-only release entitled \\"Hawks III (JR-2)\\" was also made available on the Junior's Motel imprint. Hawks was, at the time of their signing with Columbia, the first group to be signed on the strength of an unsolicited demo. The group disbanded after being dropped from Columbia; each going their separate ways. In 2007, Hawks was inducted into the Iowa Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  History  Frank Wiewel and Kirk Kaufman met during junior high school in Fort Dodge, Iowa, during the 1960s. This eventually led to the formation of the group West Minist’r, a popular group during the late 1960s to early 1970s. West Minist’r consisted of Wiewel (bass/vocals), Kaufman (guitar/vocals), Rusty Bell (guitar/vocals), Terry Dillon (keyboards/vocals 1968−69), Chuck Henderson (keyboards/bass 1969−72) and Dean Davis (drums 1968-71). Rick Schaeffer, Arnie Bode and Keith Brown replaced the members who left the group, remaining with the band until its demise in 1974. The group released three singles during their time together: \\"Bright Lights, Windy City\\" b/w \\"Carnival\\" - Razzberry Records SR 2957, \\"My Life\\" b/w \\"Mr. Fingers\\" - Magic Records KX 7432 and \\"Sister Jane\\" b/w \\"I Want You\\" (info unavailable). Kaufman, Wiewel, Keith Brown and Arnie Bode opened West Minist’r Sound in 1972. Housed in a brick chicken coop that the band had used for practice, this Tom Hidley-designed space was located on Kaufman's parent's farm outside of Otho, Iowa. The studio gained some notoriety with the visit of Brian Wilson and Spring, a group in which Wilson's wife, Marilyn, was a member. Phil Spector and Todd Rundgren had also expressed interest in the studio. Both Wiewel and Kaufman continued writing and recording during the 1970s. By 1979 Wiewel had recorded several tracks that his wife encouraged him to send out to various record labels. The songs he sent out were a mixture of originals and some covers. One of the covers, “Tell Her No”, originally by The Zombies, caught the attention of Paul Atkinson, guitarist for the Zombies who at that time worked in Columbia Record's A&R; department. He forwarded the cover to the A&R; head, Gregg Geller. Close to the same time, former drummer for Blood Sweat & Tears, Bobby Colomby, who was working at Capitol Records, expressed an interest in the material Weiwel had sent. With both companies expressing interest, a showcase was the next step. The only problem was there was no band to play for either label. All five of the yet-to-be band members and Keith \\"Howdy\\" Brown (Also an owner of the studio) had played on the demos that Wiewel had sent out, and were regrouped so the showcase could be played. The showcase took place at West Minist’r Sound. After several more demos, they sealed the deal with Columbia. The only immediate stipulation made by Columbia was that the group's name be changed. Wiewel had sent the demos out using the name Nighthawks. Using the first letters of their last names, it was decided to just shorten the name to Hawks. According to Geller, to his knowledge Hawks is the first band to be signed by Columbia Records on the basis of an unsolicited demo.  First Album  The group's first album was issued in March 1981 as simply Hawks, featuring a predominately yellow cover with 5 colored feathers on the cover − matching the number of members in the band. Tom Werman (Cheap Trick, Blue Öyster Cult, Ted Nugent) was the producer assigned to the band and Gary Ladinsky engineered. \\"Right Away” b/w “Need Your Love\\" (Columbia 11-60500) was released from the album. It rose to #63 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart. Another song from the album - \\"It’s All Right, It’s O.K.\\" − went to #32 on Billboard's AOR chart. It was released as a single b/w \\"Spend This Evening\\" (Columbia 11-02086) in May 1981. A promo single of \\"Lonely Nights\\" (Columbia 18-2401) was released in July 1981, but never saw regular release. All members except Adams contributed songs to the album. \\"I Want You, I Need You\\", written by Dave Cottrell, was the only outside composition. The strength of the songwriting was mentioned in many reviews at the time. Steve Schnee, writing for AllMusic, said, \\"Four of the five members wrote and sang great pop tunes that could have had wider appeal if this album had just received some airplay.\\" Schnee felt they were just a bit too in between rock and pop/new wave to grab more listeners. He opined the lack of promotion contributed to holding the group back from the heights they may have otherwise attained. The Philadelphia Inquirer considered the album \\"an impressive debut\\". Surprisingly, the album and single did not get as much airplay in their home state as one might imagine, though it did well on the East Coast as well as in the Southwest. Werman, writing for PopDose about what he considers his greatest misses, briefly mentions recording this album in Otho and that to him, at times, this group sounded very much like the Beatles. Two standouts for Werman were \\"Let Me In\\" and \\"The Admiral's Mutiny\\".  30 Seconds Over Otho  Hawks released their second album in June 1982, 15 months after their initial release. The release was noted in Billboard's New LP/Tape Releases column on 19 June 1982. This effort was produced by John Ryan, with the band being given co-production credits for all but three of the cuts. Again, all members aside from Adams contributed songs to the effort. Another similarity to the first album was the inclusion of one outside composition - \\"Call on Me\\" by Hanno Harders and Holger Kopp. In the credits on the inner sleeve it is noted that, aside from recording being done at Sound City Studios, tracks were recorded at West Minist’r Sound in Otho. Clarence Clemons guests on the Steen song \\"(If We Just) Stick Together\\", released as a single b/w \\"Black and White\\" (Columbia, 11-02955). Writing for AllMusic (which gave the album 4 and a half stars out of five), Steve Schnee posted that this album \\"is a close as you're going to get to a perfect commercial pop album.\\" He offers the opinion that nearly every song could have been a hit and points specifically to \\"(If We Just) Stick Together\\" as one that should have been a huge one. He also noted the split among power pop enthusiasts as to which album was the best release by the group at that point. In his opinion this album was more consistent and confident. The album made an appearance in Billboard's Top Single Picks column on 3 July 1982, noting that \\". . . Hawks is capable of producing some haunting melodies as on the Beatlesque \\"Listen to Her Sing\\" and can also rock with the best of them.\\" The album appeared the next week in Billboard's Recommended LPs column, making mention of their teaming with John Ryan. For whatever reason, this sophomore effort did not receive the same push from Columbia as the debut release.  Beyond 1982  Hawks had a chance to tour in support of the second album, but chose instead to concentrate on a third album for Columbia, which was never released due to the group being dropped from the label. During that period the group were involved in some limited live performance, too. They had opened for Joan Jett and had also appeared with Head East in concert. The purposed third album was to be more of a concept album, according to Kaufman. The band had planned to continue recording at West Minist’r as opposed to a studio in LA or New York as there were fewer distractions in Otho. A cassette-only release − Hawks III − was put out on the Junior’s Motel label (JR-2). Perfect World Radio, perhaps a more official third album, was released on 27 August 2003 by Not Lame Recordings. While this CD is currently out of print, the music can be accessed at iTunes. This contained almost all the songs from Hawks III missing only \\"Streets Are Dancing\\", \\"When It All Comes Down\\" and \\"Somebody’s Gonna Cry\\", adding additional songs not on the cassette release (see discography). On the whole, Gary Glauber, writing for PopMatters, declared PWR to be \\"a delightful showcase of their talents as pop songwriters\\". Matt Collar, writing on this album at AllMusic, gave the album 4 and a half stars out of 5, and echoed his colleague's sentiments in the earlier review of \\"Hawks\\", opining that the band was \\"too quirky and intelligent for mainstream radio and conversely too slick for the underground of college rock.\\" He also notes that the band participated in the compilation of this album. In 2007 Hawks was inducted into the Iowa Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Dave Steen found some success as a songwriter. Ringo Starr, Maria Muldaur and Son Seals are among the artists that have recorded songs he has written. Kaufman is still running Junior's Motel (as the former West Minist’r Sound is now known) as well as performing with several musical entities – Junior's Army, H and K, and HipKnosis (which includes Dave Hearn). He was inducted for a 4th time into the Iowa Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013. He also received this honor as a member of West Minist’r in 2002, 2006 for West Minist’r Sound and in 2007 for Hawks. Wiewel is involved with People Against Cancer. He was also inducted into the Iowa Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002 for being a member of West Minist’r. In 2016, Wiewel and Keith \\"Howdy\\" Brown released \\"The Road Not Traveled\\" which consisted of 8 original songs by Wiewel & Brown. Dave Hearn owns Silhouette Multimedia in Fort Dodge, Iowa. , he is a member of HipKnosis with Kaufman. Adams is still drumming and works as a contractor in Texas. On Saturday July 8, 2017 all of the members of the group got back together for the first time since 1982 to take part in Shellabration which is held yearly at the Rogers Sports Complex in Ft. Dodge. They were one of two opening acts scheduled to open for the headliner, Huey Lewis and the News. This was also the second time Hawks had appeared on the same bill with Lewis and his group - the first being when both bands performed on American Bandstand in 1980.

The reported purpose of the dam is water storage and it can also support a 3.5 MW hydroelectric power station in the future. Another purpose of the dam which has been widely reported in the Turkish press is to reduce the freedom of movement of Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) militants. Blocking and flooding valleys in close proximity to the Iraq–Turkey border is expected to help curb cross-border PKK smuggling and deny caves in which ammunition can be stored. A total of 11 dams along the border; seven in Şırnak Province and four in Hakkâri Province were implemented for this purpose. In Şırnak they are the Silopi and Şırnak Dams downstream of the Uludere Dam and the Balli, Kavşaktepe, Musatepe and Çetintepe Dams upstream on the Ortasu River. In Hakkari are the Gölgeliyamaç (since cancelled) and Çocuktepe Dams on the Güzeldere River and the Aslandağ and Beyyurdu Dams on the Bembo River.

The concept of collective impact was first articulated in the 2011 Stanford Social Innovation Review article Collective Impact, written by John Kania, Managing Director at FSG, and Mark Kramer, Kennedy School at Harvard and Co-founder FSG. Collective impact was chosen as the #2 philanthropy buzzword for 2011, and has been recognized by the White House Council for Community Solutions as an important framework for progress on social issues. The concept of collective impact hinges on the idea that in order for organizations to create lasting solutions to social problems on a large-scale, they need to coordinate their efforts and work together around a clearly defined goal. The approach of collective impact is placed in contrast to “isolated impact,” where organizations primarily work alone to solve social problems and draws on earlier works on collaborative leadership, focused on collective goals, strategic partnerships, collective and independent action aligned with those goals, shared accountability, and a backbone \\"institutional worrier\\". Collective impact is based on organizations forming cross-sector coalitions to make meaningful and sustainable progress on social issues.  Explanation  Hank Rubin (author of Collaborative Leadership: Developing Effective Partnerships for Communities and Schools, Corwin press, 2009) and Leonard Brock (director of the Rochester NY Anti-Poverty Initiative) offer a practical description of collective impact by contrasting it with collaboration: “Collective impact really is much more than collaboration! Collaboration happens when we meet together; collective impact is what we do when we’re alone … Collaboration happens when we choose to sit in the same room and work together on the same project because we share an interest in accomplishing a shared goal … On the other hand, collective impact focuses on change inside each partner organization. It begins when we, as a community, agree to a set of shared outcomes … and then, individually, go back into our home organizations, work with our staffs, boards, and volunteers to figure out what we – individually and organizationally – can best do to achieve those shared goals and then choose to make changes to accomplish this. When each of our organizations chooses to shift and align our own work and priorities in this way, we set changes in motion in all portions of our community. And these changes will last a long time.” Five conditions Initiatives must meet five criteria in order to be considered collective impact: *Common agenda: All participating organizations (government agencies, non-profits, community members, etc.) have a shared vision for social change that includes a common understanding of the problem and a joint approach to solving the problem through agreed upon actions. *Shared measurement system: Agreement on the ways success will be measured and reported with key indicators by all participating organizations. *Mutually reinforcing activities: Engagement of a diverse set of stakeholders, typically in multiple sectors, coordinating a set of differentiated activities through a mutually reinforcing plan of action. *Continuous communication: Frequent communications over a long period of time among key players within and between organizations, to build trust and encourage ongoing learning and adaptation. *Backbone organization: Ongoing support provided by an independent staff. The backbone staff tends to play six roles to move the initiative forward: Guide vision and strategy; Support aligned activity; Establish shared measurement practices; Build public will; Advance policy; and Mobilize funding. Collective impact in practice Collective impact initiatives have been employed for an issues including education, health and healthcare, animal welfare, homelessness, poverty reduction, and youth and community development. Examples include: The Strive Partnership educational initiative in Cincinnati, the environmental cleanup of the Elizabeth River in Virginia, the Shape Up Somerville campaign against childhood obesity in Somerville, Mass, and the work of the Calgary Homeless Foundation in Calgary, Canada. Partners in Progress (PIP), an initiative of the Citi Foundation and the Low Income Investment Fund, supports a broad range of projects that use a collective impact approach to address the issues of poverty and urban transformation. It emphasizes collaborative approaches to these issues, particularly at neighborhood and regional levels, guided by a local community leader (known as a “community quarterback” or “backbone organization”). Its projects are also focused on data collection to show what is or isn't working. The projects range from engaging hospital, city and community organizations to improve health in an Oakland neighborhood, to uniting city officials, employers, and the community around jobs in Brooklyn, to using transit as a hub for health, housing, and economic development in Dallas. The White House Council for Community Solutions has recognized the potential of collective impact to play a major role in transforming the ways in which communities approach their social problems. A 2012 report for the Council found that, among 12 “needle-moving community collaboratives” that had achieved at least 10 percent progress in a community wide metric, all 12 met the conditions of collective impact. The White House Council's work in collective impact is being continued today by the Aspen Forum for Community Solutions. In 2014 iit launched the Collective Impact Forum (n partnership with FSG,), an online community to support those practicing collective impact. The Promise Neighborhoods Institute is a PolicyLink initiative to unite diverse American communities on improving educational and developmental outcomes of children in underserved areas.McAfee, M., Blackwell, A. & Bell, J. (2015). Equity: The soul of collective impact. PolicyLink. More than 50 communities have contributed neighborhood data, mobilized local leaders, launched advocacy campaigns and started multi-sector partnerships to demand federal-level policy changes to fund “cradle to college” programs nationwide. The United States Breastfeeding Committee (USBC) is the “backbone organization” for a nationwide coalition of 50 healthcare organizations that support healthy breastfeeding initiatives. Goal #3 of the 2014 USBC Strategic Framework is “engage stakeholders in a collective impact model”. In 2017, the USBC updated its strategy to emphasize its organizational commitment to breastfeeding health equity. This reflects current demands from critics who want a general frame of equity added to the collective impact model framework.  Critiques of Collective impact  Corporate CEOs, small business leaders, non-profit and social-sector executives, government officials and community service practitioners have made contributions to the evolving concept in the form of insights, feedback and critique. Community psychologist Tom Wolff argues that John Kania and Mark Kramer's concept of collective impact “fails to adequately acknowledge, understand, and address” the framework in the context of community organizing. He lists the following Ten Places Where Collective Impact Gets It Wrong # Collective Impact does not address the essential requirement for meaningfully engaging those in the community most affected by the issues. # A corollary of the above is that Collective Impact emerges from top-down business consulting experience and is thus not a true community development model. # Collective Impact does not include policy change and systems change as essential and intentional outcomes of the partnership's work. # Collective Impact as described in Kania and Kramer's initial article is not based on professional and practitioner literature or the experience of the thousands of coalitions that preceded their 2011 article. # Collective Impact misses the social justice core that exists in many coalitions. # Collective Impact mislabels their study of a few case examples as “research.” # Collective Impact assumes that most coalitions are capable of finding the funds to have a well- funded backbone organization. # Collective Impact also misses a key role of the Backbone Organization – building leadership. # Community wide, multi-sectoral collaboratives cannot be simplified into Collective Impact's five required conditions. # The early available research on Collective Impact is calling into question the contribution that Collective Impact is making to coalition effectiveness. Wolff's claim that collective impact is a “failed model” has caught the attention of community service practitioners who are also skeptics of the model's “five conditions”. Calling it a top-down model for excluding community members as key stakeholders and partners of collaboration, Wolff has attracted input from many other non-profit and social-sector critics who also want the model to add elements of diversity and inclusion, civic participation, social justice and equity. Social sector leaders echo these critiques in publications like The Philanthropist, calling the five-pillared framework too simple for its intended purpose of tackling complex problems.Weaver, L. (2014). The promise and peril of collective impact. The Philanthropist, 26, 11-19. Drawing similarities between CI and other previously-popular but failed models of collaboration, community activists struggle to believe that CI has what it takes to build long-term, sustainable, conflict-free solutions to social justice issues. Pointing out several well-known case studies that underscore a real need for increased grassroots advocacy efforts, many critics believe Kania & Kramer conducted inadequate research before designing their model.Christens, B. D., & Inzeo, P. T. (2015). Widening the view: Situating collective impact among frameworks for community-led change. Community Development, 46(4), 420-435. In 2015, PolicyLink published a report called Equity: the soul of collective impact, which identified racial and economic equity as the most vital missing pieces of Kania & Kramer's concept. With no mention of equity in the CI framework, PolicyLink executives argue that CI initiatives fail to address tense power dynamics that continue to polarize American communities and therefore impede progress on social change.  Future of Collective impact  With high demand for adding a new equity frame to the original framework, Living Cities has partnered with The Collective Impact Forum to work exclusively on reforming the model for this purpose.Raderstrong, J., & Boyea-Robinson, T. (2016). The why and how of working with communities through collective impact. Community Development, 47(2), 181-193. Founders Kania & Kramer, as well as organizations like PolicyLink, Aspen Forum for Community Solutions and Urban Strategies Council have also joined this effort, signaling that opinions from the field have been taken seriously, helping the concept adapt and grow with transparency and flexibility.Kania, J., & Kramer, M. (2015). The equity imperative in collective impact. Stanford Social Innovation Review, 36-41. Ongoing discussions and updates are viewable at the Collective Impact Forum website where public input and participation is encouraged as CI continues to evolve with increased attention to community needs. Founding authors Kania and Kramer have responded to critics expressing appreciation for their interest and perspective on the topic, encouraging their continued input throughout the process to refine the model. “As this movement continues to evolve, we look forward to additional contributions such as Wolff’s published editorial (and the myriad of contributions we list here, as well as many others) that can deepen understanding of how best to practice collective impact in a manner that leads to a more just and equitable world”.Kania, J., & Kramer, M. (2016). Advancing the practice of collective impact. Blog: Collective Impact Forum. Wolff however, believes the model is flawed beyond repair and needs full replacement rather than reform. Suggesting six principles in the NonProfit Quarterly’s 2017 Collaborating for Equity and Social Justice Toolkit, Wolff empowers social innovators and thought leaders to design collaboration models for the future that will “leave the power in the hands of community residents”.

During the 1970s, he played a major role in exposing corrupt practices in Quebec's construction industry. He later served in the National Assembly of Quebec from 1989 to 1996 as a member of the Parti Québécois (PQ). Bourdon was married for a time to Louise Harel, herself a prominent Quebec politician. The pair had an amiable divorce and remained political allies in the years that followed.Hubert Bauch, \\"Klein marvels at things he has in common with Bouchard,\\" Montreal Gazette, 5 February 1996, A5. Their daughter, Catherine Harel-Bourdon, became chair of the Commission scolaire de Montréal in 2013. Early life and career Bourdon was born in Montreal and began working as a journalist with the Nouveau Journal at age sixteen. He later edited the Quartier Libre while attending the Université de Montréal. He joined Radio- Canada in 1966 as a French-language television news reporter and subsequently became president of the Syndicat général du cinéma et de la télévision. In 1968, he was the primary spokesperson for a group of Radio-Canada journalists who went on strike to support a television reporter suspended for allegedly showing \\"anti-police bias\\" in reporting on the 1968 St-Jean-Baptiste Day riots.Ronald Lebel, \\"News blackout continues on CBC's French network as strike stalemated,\\" Globe and Mail, 27 June 1968, p. 1. Bourdon and four other journalists later were given five-day suspensions for refusing to work during Radio-Canada's coverage of the 1968 Canadian federal election, which took place the day after the riots.Leslie Millin, \\"Newsmen suspended for news blackout,\\" Globe and Mail, 14 August 1968, p. 5. Bourdon was fired from Radio- Canada during the 1970 FLQ Crisis for \\"insubordination,\\" after publicly accusing the station of censorship in its coverage of the event.\\"Radio-Canada suspends newsman who participated in teach-in,\\" Globe and Mail, 4 November 1970, p. 4; \\"Two reporters fired by CBC for criticism,\\" Globe and Mail, 10 November 1970, p. 8; Dominique Clément, \\"The October Crisis of 1970: Human Rights Abuses Under the War Measures Act,\\" Journal of Canadian Studies, Spring 2008, pp. 160-186.Alan Hustak, \\"'A great Quebecer in his soul and in his heart',\\" Montreal Gazette, 30 November 2004, A10. Union activist As vice- president of the Montreal council of the Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN) in 1970, Bourdon endorsed Quebec independence and accused Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau of having imposed the War Measures Act on Quebec during the FLQ Crisis to weaken the constitutional Parti Québécois rather than the radical Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) paramilitary group. He also accused Trudeau of having put Quebec under military occupation with \\"means of terror incomparably superior to those of the FLQ.\\"\\"Montreal council of the CNTU urges independence as Quebec solution,\\" Globe and Mail, 21 October 1970, p. 9. The following year, Bourdon took part in a ten-member citizens' commission that reviewed the Canadian government's response to the crisis.\\"Group to open hearings on Quebec crisis,\\" Globe and Mail, 12 October 1971, p. 9. Bourdon was elected as leader of the CSN-affiliated Fédération nationale des syndicats du bâtiment et du bois in the early 1970s.Harvey Shepherd, \\"Rival Quebec union groups seek job security but construction industry faces confusion,\\" Globe and Mail, 16 February 1973, p. 5. Shortly thereafter, he released a dossier noir report exposing violence and corruption in Quebec's construction industry, then dominated by the rival Fédération des travailleurs du Québec (FTQ). This report received extensive coverage and prompted the provincial government to launch the Cliche Commission, which brought about wide-ranging changes. In 2004, the Montreal Gazette credited Bourdon with having \\"almost single-handedly\\" exposed the issue of corruption in the construction sector. Bourdon and his family were threatened by the mafia after the dossier noir's release and received police protection.David Johnston, \\"Healing time, Harel says,\\" Montreal Gazette, 2 October 2009, A3; Sue Montgomery, \\"Louise Harel,\\" Montreal Gazette, 2 November 2009, B2; Martin Patriquin, \\"Montreal is a disaster,\\" Maclean's, 9 November 2009, pp. 28-32. See a;sp Harvey Shepherd, \\"Rivalry among Quebec unions - with nationalist overtones,\\" Globe and Mail, 25 May 1974, p. 8. Bourdon testified before the Cliche Commission in 1974, accusing the FTQ of running a \\"private army\\" that used intimidation tactics against CSN members on construction sites; he also criticized Quebec labour minister Jean Cournoyer for allegedly favouring the FTQ in negotiations.\\"Union is compared to a private army,\\" Globe and Mail, 25 September 1974, p. 33. The commission's report ultimately found that corruption in the sector was almost entirely limited to the FTQ and \\"hardly touched\\" the CSN.During this period, leading FTQ officials sought to undermine Bourdon by doctoring a photograph to depict him as being in a homosexual relationship. (Same-sex relations were not generally approved of in Quebec during this time period.) See Richard Cleroux, \\"The labor probe that indicted Quebec society,\\" Globe and Mail, 18 March 1975, p. 1. In 1976, Bourdon led the CSN's construction workers in refusing to join a FTQ strike. He indicated that this decision resulted from the CSN's exclusion from recent labour-management negotiations.\\"Orders given for a general strike in Quebec construction industry,\\" Globe and Mail, 8 September 1976, B3. Bourdon resigned as president of the CSN's construction wing in 1979 to seek the PQ's nomination for a provincial by-election in Maisonneuve.\\"Minister's aide seeks nomination,\\" Globe and Mail, 21 August 1979, p. 9. He lost the nomination to Jacques Desmarais. Several members of the party's riding executive later resigned, charging interference from Quebec premier and PQ leader René Lévesque.\\"Intrusion by Levesque claimed, PQ workers to skip campaign,\\" Globe and Mail, 29 September 1979, p. 12. PQ activist and legislator Bourdon was on the PQ's radical left wing in the party's early years. He endorsed the CSN's 1971 decision to support the PQ, but added, \\"This doesn't mean that we won't criticize [the party] when it takes a position contrary to the interests of workers.\\"\\"CNTU council votes to back Parti Quebecois,\\" Globe and Mail, 3 May 1971, p. 3. In 1981, he helped lead the PQ's annual convention in affirming its support for full independence and rejecting René Lévesque's policy of sovereignty-association.Graham Fraser, \\"Empty places all that remain of PQ left,\\" Montreal Gazette, 14 September 1985, p. 8. An exasperated Lévesque once described Bourdon as \\"a professional dissident and a manipulator from God knows where.\\" In 1977, Bourdon strongly defended the PQ's Charter of the French Language against concerns from other party members that it would discriminate against anglophone immigrants from other parts of Canada. Bourdon's position was that the charter was not discriminatory.Richard Cleroux, \\"Defending rights of English brings trouble for PQ member,\\" Globe and Mail, 14 April 1977, p. 1. After the fall of the first PQ government in 1985, Bourdon considered running for the House of Commons of Canada as a candidate of the New Democratic Party. At the time, he was quoted as saying, \\"independence is not on the agenda any more.\\"Graham Fraser, \\"Public regard for Broadbent pushing NDP up in Quebec,\\" Globe and Mail, 16 July 1987, A8. He ultimately decided not to run. ;In opposition Bourdon was elected to the National Assembly of Quebec for the newly created east-end Montreal division of Pointe-aux-Trembles in the 1989 provincial election. He highlighted environmental concerns during the campaign, saying that petrochemical companies should pay the costs of removing toxic chemicals from the air and soil of east-end Montreal.Elisabeth Kalbfuss, \\"East-end PQ candidates want polluters to pay cleanup costs,\\" Montreal Gazette, 18 August 1994, A4. The Liberal Party was returned to a second consecutive majority government in this election under Robert Bourassa's leadership, and Bourdon served for the next four years as a member of the official opposition. At different times, he was his party's critic for labour, justice, and issues of public integrity.Don MacPherson, \\"Premier may find relief in the weather,\\" Montreal Gazette, 18 November 1989, B3; Daniel Singer, \\"Quebec to recruit more English bureaucrats,\\" Ottawa Citizen, 17 May 1991, A3; Andrew McIntosh, \\"Blasting Hydro; Utility is blamed for slapdash brief to legislature committee hearings,\\" Montreal Gazette, 31 May 1994, D2. In December 1989, Bourdon accused the Bourassa government of unfair patronage tactics in awarding a contract for the expansion of a North Shore hospital to a firm with Liberal ties, even though the firm had not initially been in the running. The government denied the charge.Philip Authier, \\"Contracts go to Liberal cronies: PQ; You haven't an iota of proof Cote says of PQ campaign,\\" Montreal Gazette, 14 December 1989, A5. The following summer, Bourdon announced the PQ's support for a government task force report on tightening the rules for government contracts.Philip Authier, \\"Tighten contract system to limit patronage: report; Task force finds potential for abuse,\\" Montreal Gazette, 5 June 1990, A5. Bourdon strongly criticized the PQ leadership at the party's 1991 convention, after party whip Jacques Brassard introduced a successful motion in support of the Gulf War. Bourdon charged that Brassard had introduced the motion due to pressure from the American government and speculated that most delegates who supported it were fearful of offending American interests at a time when the PQ had reasonable aspirations of returning to power. Bourdon himself strongly opposed the war, saying, \\"I don't want Quebecers coming home dead in plastic bags.\\" At the same convention, he convinced delegates to endorse, for the first time, the right of self-determination for the Palestinian people.Philip Authier, \\"PQ left and right wing divided over Gulf war,\\" Montreal Gazette, 28 January 1991, A3. Bourdon and Equality Party leader Robert Libman formed an improbable alliance in early 1992 to support the rights of Montreal Island merchants, who had seen property tax increases of up to one hundred per cent due to the provincial government's restructuring of municipal tax codes.Don Macpherson, \\"Political foes join in one-night stand on Quebec taxes,\\" Ottawa Citizen, 20 February 1992, A15. As a legislator, Bourdon took an interest in issues of concern to anglophone Quebecers and Quebecers from cultural communities. He criticized the Bourassa government's 1991 announcement of a ten per cent hiring target for anglophones in the civil service, saying that anglophones were already welcome to apply for positions and did not face discrimination.Elisabeth Kalbfuss, \\"Quebec sets 10% hiring target for anglos,\\" Montreal Gazette, 17 May 1991, A1. He argued that the government should instead determine why anglophones were not already applying in larger numbers. Later in the same year, Bourdon served on a PQ task force on the rights of Quebec anglophones; in this capacity, he recommended easing Quebec's restrictive sign laws to permit a greater use of English-language signs at commercial establishments. He was quoted as saying, \\"We have to head toward a relaxing of the legislation on commercial signs. Even though I don't think the law is breaching a fundamental right, it's very clear it's perceived as such by the Quebec anglophone community. It's an abscess to them.\\"Tu Thanh Ha, \\"PQ appoints task force on anglo rights,\\" Montreal Gazette, 21 October 1991, A6; Philip Authier, \\"PQ task force at odds on softening sign law,\\" Montreal Gazette, 25 November 1992, For a summary of the report's conclusions, see Sarah Scott, \\"Independence won't restrict English rights: report; Task force says survival of schools depends on anglophone community,\\" Montreal Gazette, 26 March 1993, A4. Bourdon offered his support to a group of hunger-striking refugee claimants from Latin America in early 1990.Debbie Parkes, \\"Refugee claimants end fast; 41 prominent Quebecers promise support,\\" Montreal Gazette, 6 January 1990, A3. He subsequently called for more immigration to Montreal,Elisabeth Kalbfuss, \\"Immigrants not a threat: minister; City won't lose French face, Gagnon-Tremblay says,\\" Montreal Gazette, 7 March 1991, A1. and in 1993 he sought an independent investigation into the death of Marcellus François, a black Montrealer who had been shot by Montreal Urban Community police officers two years earlier.Michelle Lalonde, \\"Police officers who shot Kelly are still patrolling Snowdon; PQ MNA joins black community leaders in calling for independent inquiry on fatal shooting,\\" Montreal Gazette, 6 January 1993, A3. See also Aaron Derfel, \\"Ethnics, politicians tell police: Stop relying on guns,\\" Montreal Gazette, 6 March 1993, A3. He later criticized a proposal from the upstart Action démocratique du Québec (ADQ) party to financially penalize immigrants who failed to learn French, describing the proposal as \\"stupid and contrary to the rights of individuals\\" as well as \\"manifestly illegal.\\"Sarah Scott, \\"PQ critic blasts new party's immigrant plan,\\" Montreal Gazette, 8 March 1994, A5. In September 1993, Bourdon supported a demonstration calling on governments to stop what was described as the genocide of Bosnian Muslims in Bosnia and Hercegovina.\\"Well-known Quebecers back rally; Demonstration against genocide in Bosnia,\\" Montreal Gazette, 5 September 1993, A3. Bourdon supported Roger Laporte's candidacy for the Bloc Québécois (BQ) nomination in Mercier in the buildup to the 1993 Canadian federal election and criticized party rules that granted voting rights to delegates from outside the riding. PQ leader Jacques Parizeau publicly rebuked Bourdon for the latter statement, saying that it was inappropriate for PQ members to question the by-laws of an allied federal party. (Laporte lost the nomination to Francine Lalonde.)Tu Thanh Ha, \\"Don't horn in on Bloc's act, Parizeau warns Pequistes; Stop meddling in federal nominations: PQ chief,\\" Montreal Gazette, 4 April 1993, A4. Several of Bourdon's activities made him unpopular with senior PQ officials, and he faced a serious nomination challenge from Nicole Léger in late 1993. Bourdon ultimately won the challenge by eight votes, after several of Léger's potential supporters were found to have been improperly recruited to the party.Rheal Seguin, \\"Parti Quebecois fears fallout from riding fight Keep nomination irregularities quiet, officials advise,\\" Montreal Gazette, 16 December 1993, A9. This article indicates that Bernard Landry and Guy Chevrette were among Bourdon's most prominent opponents within the party. ;Government backbencher Bourdon was re-elected in the 1994 Quebec provincial election, in which the PQ won a majority government under Parizeau's leadership. For the next two years, he served as a government backbencher. His role in public life was significantly reduced, however, as his health was in a serious state of decline. He resigned from the legislature in June 1996 due to the effects of multiple sclerosis, which he had been diagnosed with three years earlier. In his resignation speech, he said that he regretted having to leave before the PQ government passed its promised pay equity legislation.\\"PQ MNA quits,\\" Montreal Gazette, 16 June 1996, A15. After 1995 Quebec referendum on sovereignty, in which the Quebec sovereigntist option was narrowly defeated, Bourdon was quoted as saying, \\"I see it as perfectly normal that (for English-speaking Quebecers) it's better to be majority in Canada than minority in Quebec. If I were an anglophone, I'd be a federalist.\\"Sarah Scott, \\"Francophone reprisal for No vote never materialized,\\" Montreal Gazette, 4 November 1995, A1.

It is located in the village of Hareid on the eastern side of the island of Hareidlandet. It is the church for the Hareid parish which is part of the Søre Sunnmøre prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Møre. The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1877 by the architects Stokkeland & Schirmer. The church seats about 400 people. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to 1432, but the original stave church was likely built well before that time (probably in the 12th or 13th century. Over the centuries, records show that the building was enlarged and renovated, reaching a maximum size of about . Not much else is known of the church. On 25 February 1806, the church was struck by lightning and it burned to the ground. A replacement church was built a little east of the old stave church. It was a timber-framed, octagonal building that was designed by the local parish priest, Peder Thomas Buschmann. This church was started in 1807 but it was not fully completed until 1820. The church site was not suitable for supporting the building and the timber frame began to sag and shift and so after nearly 60 years had gone by it was torn down and replaced. The new church was built in a Romanesque Revival style and it was consecrated on 13 December 1877 by the local parish priest Christian Wisløff.

Her best-known dramas include Miss Mermaid and Dear Heaven. Career Im Sung-han began her career writing for single-episode anthologies. Her first known work was the 1991 episode \\"Standing in a Maze\\" for KBS's Drama Game, then she moved on to MBC's Best Theater in 1997, with \\"Definitely\\" (for which Im won a screenplay award). She also used another pseudonym, Im Hyang-ran (), in writing other Best Theater episodes. This led to her first television drama series in 1998, See and See Again (also known as Looking Again and Again and Can't Take My Eyes Off You), about two families doubly related by marriage. Despite its popularity (its peak rating of 57.3% was the highest ever recorded for a daily soap operahttp://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/culture/2019/01/142_261474.html), it was considered by TV critics as one of the worst dramas that year. Im's follow-up Foolish Princes (2000) was about four half-brothers, and she and director Jo Jung-hyun had conflicts over her writing. Miss Mermaid (2002) starred Jang Seo-hee as a TV writer whose father left her and her blind mother years ago, so she decides to wreak revenge by writing a thinly veiled autobiographical series and casts her unsuspecting stepmother, an actress, in the role of the blind, deserted wife; she also steals her half-sister's fiancé. It recorded high ratings of 40%, resulting in several extensions for the drama. At the MBC Drama Awards, Jang won Best Actress and the Grand Prize. But Miss Mermaid also attracted criticism, and the Anti Im Sung-han Café was established,http://cafe.daum.net/18dlsdj an Internet community club whose thousands of members are vehement critics of Im. It was the first ever \\"anti- café\\" to target a Korean drama writer. Their online posts mocked the drama's \\"nonsensical\\" plot, along with scenes which implied that a baby's autism was caused by his mother's stress during a divorce, and that washing each strawberry with a toothbrush is described as normal. Lee Da-hae rose to fame in Lotus Flower Fairy (also known as Heaven's Fate, 2004), in her role of a woman who loses everything when she becomes possessed by spirits as a Korean shaman, called a \\"mudang.\\" The drama questioned whether it's possible to overcome one's fate. When ratings remained in the 20% range, Im was later replaced by another writer, Kim Na-hyun. Dear Heaven (2005-2006) starred Han Hye-sook as a middle-aged woman who wants to atone to the biological daughter (Yoon Jung-hee) she'd abandoned, by deliberately matchmaking the latter with her current stepson (Lee Tae-gon). Viewers were divided on whether it was \\"immoral\\" and \\"incestuous,\\" and the controversy propelled it to becoming the 5th highest rated TV program in Korea for the year 2006. Han won the Grand Prize at the SBS Drama Awards. Ahyeon-dong Madam (also known as Queen of Ahyun and Opposites Attract, 2007) explored age differences in relationships, when a female public prosecutor (Wang Hee-ji) falls for a male colleague (Kim Min- sung) who is 12 years younger. Assorted Gems (also known as Jewel Bibimbap, 2009) portrayed the ups and downs of a family with four brothers and sisters named after jewels: Jade, Ruby, Coral, and Amber (played by Go Na-eun, So Yi- hyun, Lee Hyun-jin and Lee Il-min, respectively). The premise of New Tales of Gisaeng (2011) was that \\"gisaeng\\"—the Korean equivalent of courtesans equipped with wide knowledge in poetry, culture and politics, who entertained noblemen and royalty of the Joseon Dynasty—continue to exist in modern-day Korea. Newcomers Im Soo-hyang and Sung Hoon played the lead roles. Despite ratings of over 20%, it was criticized for Im's abrupt inclusion of supernatural elements which were considered \\"pointless\\" to the plot by viewers. Princess Aurora (2013) was about the romance between the youngest daughter (Jeon So-min) of a wealthy family who owns a food conglomerate, and an irritable novelist (Oh Chang-seok). But the show gained notoriety when Im abruptly killed off 12 characters and was accused of nepotism. This was followed by Apgujeong Midnight Sun (2014-2015), about four people (and their families) whose lives intersect while working at a cable TV station. But the series received scrutiny from the Korea Communications Standards Commission for a revenge storyline that the review board deemed too \\"violent\\" and \\"unethical.\\" On April 23, 2015, MBC released a statement that the network would no longer work with Im in future projects; Im responded by announcing her retirement, saying she had intended to quit the TV industry after writing 10 dramas. In January 2019, Im launched her first book, \\"Cancer Cells Are Part of Life\\" (literal translation), which chronicled her health issues and habits. Published by her own company Book Soopulim, the title was based on a controversial line from Princess Aurora.Notorious drama writer returns with health book On August 6, 2020, Im signed an exclusive management contract with Jidam Inc. In an earlier press release, the company stated that her next project may happen in 2021, however, it was eventually confirmed that her comeback drama titled Marriage Story will air in December 2020 via TV Chosun.https://www.chosun.com/entertainments/entertain_photo/2020/10/14/PCOB24VAFSJOTHTLGKWFSDL4HA/ =Critical assessment= Im is considered a hitmaker, as most of her projects reach 20-30% television ratings on average. But she is divisive, becoming a target of criticism from viewers and the media for her excessive use of provocative storylines (called \\"makjang\\" in Korean, this typically involves adultery, revenge, rape, birth secrets, fatal illnesses and incest). Personal life Im met assistant director Son Moon-kwonAlso romanized as Son Mun-gwon. while filming Dear Heaven, and the couple married in January 2007. They later collaborated on Ahyeon-dong Madam (like the protagonists, Im and Son also had a 12-year age difference), Assorted Gems, and New Tales of Gisaeng. On January 21, 2012, the 40-year-old Son committed suicide by hanging himself from a staircase with a necktie, at his house in Ilsan, Gyeonggi Province. Im was the one who found him, and she requested the police that the death be kept a secret from his family and colleagues. News about Son's death broke nearly a month later on February 13. In March 2012, Son's family filed a lawsuit against Im for psychological injury because she told them of his death three weeks after the fact, and held the funeral secretly, preventing an opportunity for family and friends to pay their respects. In an interview, Son's sister alleged that her brother and Im were married in name only (in order to further Im's career), and never lived together in their five years of marriage. Finding it suspicious that Im lied to them that their son had died of a heart attack, and doubting the authenticity of his will, Son's parents asked the police for a re-investigation, in case of foul play. In October 2012, prosecutors cleared Im over her husband's death, and officially ruled Son's death a suicide. The psychological injury lawsuit is ongoing.

It is the largest provider of weighing instruments for use in laboratory, industrial, and food retailing applications. The company also provides various analytical instruments, process analytics instruments, and end-of-line inspection systems. The company operates worldwide with 70% of net sales, derived in equal parts, from Europe and from the Americas. Asian business is included in the remaining 30%. Mettler Toledo is headquartered in Switzerland and incorporated in the United States. Formation and history =Toledo Scale Company= Toledo counter-top fan scale Toledo dial scale A Toledo scale used in a hospital cafeteria Allen DeVilbiss, Jr. (1873-1911) was an inventor who lived in Toledo, Ohio, United States. He became interested in the concept of weighing machines, and conceived the idea of an automatic computing pendulum scale. He was able to prove his concept with a local butcher, who realized that customers appreciated the automatic computation which eliminated the risk of overcharging. While his invention gained in popularity, DeVilbiss was not interested in making it a viable business. In 1900, Henry Theobald (1868-1924) was fired from his job at the National Cash Register Company. He decided to start his own business, and was convinced that selling the automatic computing scales could be a good business. He solicited additional financial investors and purchased the company from DeVilbiss. On July 10, 1901, the Toledo Computing Scale and Cash Register Company was incorporated. By May 1902, Theobald's company was selling more than 100 cash registers with scales per month. By that time, John H. Patterson, Theobald's boss from NCR, threatened to sue the new company for patent infringements. As an alternative, Patterson offered to purchase all cash register patents and property, along with the stipulation that Theobald would no longer engage in the cash register business. The investors, who worried about the costs of patent infringement litigation, agreed to the sale in June 1902. Since cash registers were no longer part of Theobald's business, he changed the name to Toledo Computing Scale Company. Theobald later coined the phrase \\"No Springs, Honest Weight\\" as a slogan for the new company. In the years that followed, Theobald realized that the weighing scale was the most important part of the retail transaction between the merchant and the customer. He felt that many of his competitors who used spring scale technology, especially Dayton Scale Company, were allowing merchants to cheat their customers by incorrectly calculating the total price of a measured good. He campaigned for more government regulation of weights and measures to eliminate dishonest weighing systems. On October 1, 1907, Massachusetts adopted the first weights and measures laws in the United States. In 1912, the company name changed once again, to Toledo Scale Company. Additionally, a new scale line featuring a double pendulum mechanism and a dial face was introduced and was most suited for industrial applications. =Mettler Instruments AG= In 1945, Dr. Erhard Mettler, a Swiss engineer, started a precision mechanics company in Küsnacht, Switzerland. He invented the substitution principle with a single-pan balance, capable of being produced in series. Analytical balances with a single weighing pan gradually replaced conventional two-pan balances in the laboratory. Mettler Toledo UV7 Spectrophotometer Mettler diversified its product line in 1970 with the introduction of its automated titration systems, and the acquisition of balance manufacturer Microwa AG. Mettler acquired its 500-employee competitor August Sauter KG, of Albstadt-Ebingen, Germany, in 1971, for its specialized industrial and retail scales.\\"History of Mettler- Toledo International Inc.,\\" International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 30, St. James Press, 2000. In 1980, Dr. Mettler sold his business to Ciba- Geigy AG. A third pillar - after laboratory and industrial - was created: the retail business. Technological progress had made it possible to advance retail scales to instruments for the management of perishable goods. =Mettler Toledo= In 1989, Reliance Electric sold the Toledo Scale division to Ciba- Geigy AG. The division was then merged with Mettler Instruments. The merger vastly increased the global scope of the company, which, as a result, operated in 18 countries. Mettler acquired another competitor, Ohaus Corp., in 1990. In 1992, the company was incorporated as Mettler Toledo, Inc. In 1996-97, Mettler Toledo, Inc. was sold by Ciba-Geigy AG to the New York-based AEA Investors Inc., in preparation for a subsequent initial public offering. The initial public offering was completed and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol . The resultant company is currently headquartered in Greifensee, Switzerland, with offices for its many brands based around the world. Operational structure Mettler-Toledo is a global manufacturer and marketer of precision instruments for use in laboratory, industrial, and food retailing applications. They are geographically diversified with sales in 2012 derived 34% from Europe, 34% from the Americas, and 32% from Asia and other countries. The Company has an extensive global sales and service organization with approximately 6,000, or approximately one- half, of the employees providing sales and service in 36 countries. The Company has a manufacturing presence in Europe, the United States, and China. =Laboratory Instruments= In 1952, the measurement of up to one ten- millionth of a gram became possible with the laboratory balance products. \\"The Mettler Balance\\" proved to be a catchphrase in the laboratory. Consequently, with the advancement of microprocessor technology over the years, a wide range of products for the laboratory were invented, like automated titrators and thermal analyzers. Mettler-Toledo laboratory products and technology were able to improve processes in research and development, drug discovery, and quality control. Application-specific software for balances provides data analysis opportunities to enhance accuracy, productivity, and compliance. The most recent product development for the laboratory was the array-based UV/VIS spectrophotometer which encompasses four different units including UV5, UV7, UV5Bio, and UV5Nano.http://www.mt.com/uvvis RAININ Instrument In 2001, Mettler-Toledo purchased Rainin Instrument, LLC, which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Mettler- Toledo.https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037646/000103764601500013/tpexhibit.txt Rainin supplies precision manual liquid handling instruments and calibration services worldwide.

A green 2D electron gas is sketched at the interface. The interface between lanthanum aluminate (LaAlO3) and strontium titanate (SrTiO3) is a notable materials interface because it exhibits properties not found in its constituent materials. Individually, LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 are non-magnetic insulators, yet LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interfaces can exhibit electrical metallic conductivity, superconductivity, ferromagnetism, large negative in-plane magnetoresistance, and giant persistent photoconductivity. The study of how these properties emerge at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface is a growing area of research in condensed matter physics.  Emergent properties  = Conductivity = Under the right conditions, the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface is electrically conductive, like a metal. The angular dependence of Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations indicates that the conductivity is two-dimensional, leading many researchers to refer to it as a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). Two-dimensional does not mean that the conductivity has zero thickness, but rather that the electrons are confined to only move in two directions. It is also sometimes called a two- dimensional electron liquid (2DEL) to emphasize the importance of inter- electron interactions.  Conditions necessary for conductivity  Not all LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interfaces are conductive. Typically, conductivity is achieved only when: *The LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface is along the 001,110 and 111 crystallographic direction *The LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 are crystalline and epitaxial *The SrTiO3 side of the interface is TiO2-terminated (causing the LaAlO3 side of the interface to be LaO-terminated) *The LaAlO3 layer is at least 4 unit cells thick Conductivity can also be achieved when the SrTiO3 is doped with oxygen vacancies; however, in that case, the interface is technically LaAlO3/SrTiO3−x instead of LaAlO3/SrTiO3.  Hypotheses for conductivity  The source of conductivity at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface has been debated for years. SrTiO3 is a wide-band gap semiconductor that can be doped n-type in a variety of ways. Clarifying the mechanism behind the conductivity is a major goal of current research. Four leading hypotheses are: *Polar gating *Oxygen vacancies *Intermixing *Structural distortions = Polar gating = Below the critical thickness: Further from the interface, the energy of electrons in the LaAlO3 rises, due to the LaAlO3's built-in electric field. (Not to scale) LaAlO3 grows thicker, the energy of electrons on the surface rises so high that they leave, leaving holes (or oxygen vacancies) behind. The positively charged holes (or oxygen vacancies) attract electrons to the lowest-energy empty states, located in the conduction band of the SrTiO3. (Not to scale) Polar gating was the first mechanism used to explain the conductivity at LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interfaces. It postulates that the LaAlO3, which is polar in the 001 direction (with alternating sheets of positive and negative charge), acts as an electrostatic gate on the semiconducting SrTiO3. When the LaAlO3 layer grows thicker than three unit cells, its valence band energy rises above the Fermi level, causing holes (or positively charged oxygen vacancies ) to form on the outer surface of the LaAlO3. The positive charge on the surface of the LaAlO3 attracts negative charge to nearby available states. In the case of the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface, this means electrons accumulate in the surface of the SrTiO3, in the Ti d bands. The strengths of the polar gating hypothesis are that it explains why conductivity requires a critical thickness of four unit cells of LaAlO3 and that it explains why conductivity requires the SrTiO3 to be TiO2-terminated. The polar gating hypothesis also explains why alloying the LaAlO3 increases the critical thickness for conductivity. One weakness of the hypothesis is that it predicts that the LaAlO3 films should exhibit a built-in electric field; so far, x-ray photoemission experiments and other experiments have shown little to no built-in field in the LaAlO3 films. The polar gating hypothesis also cannot explain why Ti3+ is detected when the LaAlO3 films are thinner than the critical thickness for conductivity. The polar gating hypothesis is sometimes called the polar catastrophe hypothesis, alluding to the counterfactual scenario where electrons don't accumulate at the interface and instead voltage in the LaAlO3 builds up forever. The hypothesis has also been called the electronic reconstruction hypothesis, highlighting the fact that electrons, not ions, move to compensate the building voltage. = Oxygen vacancies = Another hypothesis is that the conductivity comes from free electrons left by oxygen vacancies in the SrTiO3. SrTiO3 is known to be easily doped by oxygen vacancies, so this was initially considered a promising hypothesis. However, electron energy loss spectroscopy measurements have bounded the density of oxygen vacancies well below the density necessary to supply the measured free electron densities. Another proposed possibility is that oxygen vacancies in the surface of the LaAlO3 are remotely doping the SrTiO3. Under generic growth conditions, multiple mechanisms can coexist. A systematic study across a wide growth parameter space demonstrated different roles played by oxygen vacancy formation and the polar gating at different interfaces. An obvious difference between oxygen vacancies and polar gating in creating the interface conductivity is that the carriers from oxygen vacancies are thermally activated as the donor level of oxygen vacancies is usually separated from the SrTiO3 conduction band, consequently exhibiting the carrier freeze-out effect at low temperatures; in contrast, the carriers originating from the polar gating are transferred into the SrTiO3 conduction band (Ti 3d orbitals) and are therefore degenerate. = Intermixing = Lanthanum is a known dopant in SrTiO3, so it has been suggested that La from the LaAlO3 mixes into the SrTiO3 and dopes it n-type. Multiple studies have shown that intermixing takes place at the interface; however, it is not clear whether there is enough intermixing to provide all of the free carriers. For example, a flipped interface between a SrTiO3 film and a LaAlO3 substrate is insulating. = Structural distortions = A fourth hypothesis is that the LaAlO3 crystal structure undergoes octahedral rotations in response to the strain from the SrTiO3. These octahedral rotations in the LaAlO3 induce octahedral rotations in the SrTiO3, increasing the Ti d-band width enough so that electrons are no longer localized. = Superconductivity = Superconductivity was first observed in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interfaces in 2007, with a critical temperature of ~200 mK. Like the conductivity, the superconductivity appears to be two-dimensional. = Ferromagnetism = Hints of ferromagnetism in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 were first seen in 2007, when Dutch researchers observed hysteresis in the magnetoresistance of LaAlO3/SrTiO3. Follow up measurements with torque magnetometry indicated that the magnetism in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 persisted all the way to room temperature. In 2011, researchers at Stanford University used a scanning SQUID to directly image the ferromagnetism, and found that it occurred in heterogeneous patches. Like the conductivity in LaAlO3/SrTiO3, the magnetism only appeared when the LaAlO3 films were thicker than a few unit cells. However, unlike conductivity, magnetism was seen at SrO-terminated surfaces as well as TiO2-terminated surfaces. The discovery of ferromagnetism in a materials system that also superconducts spurred a flurry of research and debate, because ferromagnetism and superconductivity almost never coexist together. Ferromagnetism requires electron spins to align, while superconductivity typically requires electron spins to anti-align. = Magnetoresistance = Magnetoresistance measurements are a major experimental tool used to understand the electronic properties of materials. The magnetoresistance of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interfaces has been used to reveal the 2D nature of conduction, carrier concentrations (through the hall effect), electron mobilities, and more.  Field applied out-of-plane  At low magnetic field, the magnetoresistance of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 is parabolic versus field, as expected for an ordinary metal. However, at higher fields, the magnetoresistance appears to become linear versus field. Linear magnetoresistance can have many causes, but so far there is no scientific consensus on the cause of linear magnetoresistance in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interfaces. Linear magnetoresistance has also been measured in pure SrTiO3 crystals, so it may be unrelated to the emergent properties of the interface.  Field applied in-plane  At low temperature (T < 30 K), the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface exhibits negative in-plane magnetoresistance, sometimes as large as -90%. The large negative in-plane magnetoresistance has been ascribed to the interface's enhanced spin-orbit interaction. = Electron gas distribution at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface= Experimentally, the charge density profile of the electron gas at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface has a strongly asymmetric shape with a rapid initial decay over the first 2 nm and a pronounced tail that extends to about 11 nm. A wide variety of theoretical calculations support this result. Importantly, to get electron distribution one have to take into account field-dependent dielectric constant of SrTiO3.  Comparison to other 2D electron gases  The 2D electron gas that arises at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface is notable for two main reasons. First, it has very high carrier concentration, on the order of 1013 cm−2. Second, if the polar gating hypothesis is true, the 2D electron gas has the potential to be totally free of disorder, unlike other 2D electron gases that require doping or gating to form. However, so far researchers have been unable to synthesize interfaces that realize the promise of low disorder.  Synthesis methods  Interfaces are synthesized by shooting a laser at a LaAlO3 target. Ablated material flies off the target and lands onto a heated SrTiO3 crystal. Most LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interfaces are synthesized using pulsed laser deposition. A high-power laser ablates a LaAlO3 target, and the plume of ejected material is deposited onto a heated SrTiO3 substrate. Typical conditions used are: *Laser wavelength of 248 nm *Laser fluence of 0.5 J/cm2 to 2 J/cm2 *Substrate temperature of 600 °C to 850 °C *Background oxygen pressure of 10−5 Torr to 10−3 Torr Some LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interfaces have also been synthesized by molecular beam epitaxy, sputtering, and atomic layer deposition.  Similar interfaces  To better understand in the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface, researchers have synthesized a number of analogous interfaces between other polar perovskite films and SrTiO3. Some of these analogues have properties similar to LaAlO3/SrTiO3, but some do not. = Conductive interfaces = *GdTiO3/SrTiO3 *LaTiO3/SrTiO3 *LaVO3/SrTiO3 *LaGaO3/SrTiO3 *PrAlO3/SrTiO3 *NdAlO3/SrTiO3 *NdGaO3/SrTiO3 *GdAlO3/SrTiO3 *Nd0.35Sr0.65MnO3/SrTiO3 *Al2O3/SrTiO3 *amorphous-YAlO3/SrTiO3 *La0.5Al0.5Sr0.5Ti0.5O3/SrTiO3 *DyScO3/SrTiO3 *KTaO3/SrTiO3 *CaZrO3/SrTiO3 = Insulating interfaces = *LaCrO3/SrTiO3 *LaMnO3/SrTiO3 *La2O3/SrTiO3 *Y2O3/SrTiO3 *LaYO3/SrTiO3 *EuAlO3/SrTiO3 *BiMnO3/SrTiO3  Applications  As of 2015, there are no commercial applications of the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface. However, speculative applications have been suggested, including field-effect devices, sensors, photodetectors, and thermoelectrics; related LaVO3/SrTiO3 is a functional solar cell albeit hitherto with a low efficiency.

It was the first general strike in North America and involved some 20,000 workers who struck for a ten-hour workday and increased wages. The strike ended in complete victory for the workers.Philip S. Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Vol. 1, From Colonial Times to the Founding of The American Federation of Labor, International Publishers, 1975, pages 116–118 Background Prior to the shorter work day movement, employers had hired and paid workers on the basis of the agriculture working day of \\"sun to sun\\" (sunrise to sunset) – a situation which meant comparatively short hours in the winter months but days extending to as many as fifteen hours during the late spring and early summer.Sumner, \\"Citizenship,\\" pp. 186-187. For some trades this worked out to a manageable average over the course of a year, but for the construction trades in particular, a business marked by heavy unemployment during the winter months owing to the weather, this state of affairs was regarded as an intolerable burden. As a result, the idea emerged that the length of the work day should be fixed by time rather than the rise and fall of the sun, and agitation for a ten-hour day began.Sumner, \\"Citizenship,\\" pg. 186. Boston circular During the 1820s and 1830s, a number of strikes were commenced to shorten the work day. In June 1827 some 600 Philadelphia journeymen carpenters – that is, the wage laborers employed by master carpenters – went on strike for the citywide establishment of the ten-hour day. Carpenters in Boston, Massachusetts similarly struck for a ten- hour workday in 1825 and 1832. However, the strikes were unsuccessful at shortening the work day. In 1835 Boston carpenters went on strike again for a ten-hour workday and were soon joined by masons and stone-cutters. The strikers chose Seth Luther and two other workers as leaders, and they issued a circular stating their demands. The circular read in part \\"We have been too long subjected to the odious, cruel, unjust and tyrannical system which compels the operative mechanic to exhaust his physical and mental powers. We have rights and duties to perform as American citizens and members of society, which forbid us to dispose of more than ten hours for a day's work.\\"Commons, ed., Documentary History of American Industrial Society, Vol. VI, page 96 During the strike, the Boston workers organized a travelling committee and requested the assistance of workers in other cities. The Boston circular was well received by workers throughout the country. Although the Boston strike was eventually defeated, the circular was pivotal in motivating workers in Philadelphia to organize their own strike that year for a ten-hour workday. The president of the Carpenter's Society of Philadelphia, William Thompson, told Seth Luther that \\"the carpenters considered the Boston circular had broken their shackles, loosened their chains, and made them free from the galling yoke of excessive labor.\\" General strike upright=.6 Influenced by events in Boston, unskilled Irish workers on the Schuylkill River coal wharves the same year went on strike for a ten-hour day. Three hundred workers marched on the coal wharves. They were led by a worker with a sword who threatened death to anyone who crossed the picket line and unloaded coal from the 75 vessels waiting in the water. The coal heavers were soon joined by workers from many other trades, including leather dressers, printers, carpenters, bricklayers, masons, house painters, bakers, and city employees. On June 6, a mass meeting of workers, lawyers, doctors, and a few businessmen, was held in the State House courtyard. The meeting unanimously adopted a set of resolutions giving full support to the workers' demand for wage increases and a shorter workday, as well as increased wages for women workers and a boycott of any coal merchant who worked his men more than ten hours.Commons, ed., Documentary History of American Industrial Society, Vol. VI, page 39 The strike quickly came to a close after city public works employees joined the action. The Philadelphia city government announced that the \\"hours of labour of the working men employed under the authority of the city corporation would be from 'six to six' during the summers season, allowing one hour for breakfast, and one for dinner.\\"Proceedings of the Government and Citizens of Philadelphia on the Reduction of the Hours of Labor, and Increase of Wages, pages 4-10 On June 22, three weeks after the coal heavers initially struck, the ten-hour system and an increase in wages for piece-workers was adopted in the city. Aftermath The news of the strikers' success spread to other cities and was given large coverage. The labor press carried the news as far south as the Carolinas, and a wave of successful strikes followed in its wake. Strikes for the ten-hour day hit towns such as New Brunswick and Paterson, New Jersey, Batavia and Seneca Falls, New York, Hartford, Connecticut, and Salem, Massachusetts. By the end of 1835, the ten-hour day had become the standard for most city laborers who worked by the day with the exception of workers in Boston. Subsequently, the ten-hour day became an integral part of the labor movement in Europe.

Fewer than 50 individuals are thought to exist. Its habitat lies in a transitional zone between three ecoregions: dry spiny bush, humid littoral forest, and humid forest. First collected in 2001 and thought to be a subpopulation of the furry-eared dwarf lemur (C. crossleyi), it was not formally described until 2013. It is one of six species of dwarf lemur, though the research that identified it also suggested the existence of many more new species. Taxonomic history The Lavasoa dwarf lemur belongs to the genus Cheirogaleus (dwarf lemurs) within the family Cheirogaleidae. Between October 2001 and December 2006, researchers collected ten mature adults (five male and five female) along with six immature individuals. The lemurs were released after they were measured and small tissue samples were taken from their ears. The holotype (AH-X-00-181) was an adult male, captured, recorded, and released at Petit Lavasoa on 10 October 2001. The analysis was published in 2013 by Dana Thiele and Andreas Hapke of Johannes Gutenberg University and Emilienne Razafimahatratra of the University of Antananarivo. In the two decades prior to 2013, only two dwarf lemur species were known, but in 2000 primatologist Colin Groves raised the number to seven based on morphological data acquired from museum samples. However, in 2009 and 2011, two of these new species were rejected. The Lavasoa dwarf lemur, named for the Lavasoa Mountains in southern Madagascar, became the sixth known species in 2013 when it was differentiated from the furry-eared dwarf lemur (C. crossleyi) through analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear material performed by a team of German and Malagasy researchers. Furthermore, their research suggested the existence of three more new dwarf lemur species that they provisionally named Cheirogaleus sp. Ranomafana Andrambovato, Cheirogaleus sp. Bekaraoka Sambava, and Cheirogaleus sp. Ambanja, based on the regions the samples were collected. The Lavasoa dwarf lemur is most closely related to C. sp. Ranomafana/Andrambovato. The authors speculated that even greater species diversity may be found among dwarf lemurs by future studies due to their large geographic range and the great genetic distance exhibited within the genus. Description The Lavasoa dwarf lemur is a small lemur, weighing and measuring in length. Its eyes are surrounded by black fur that forms a ring around the eyes. The black fur runs from the eyes to the animal's pointed nose. The rest of the fur on its head is reddish-brown, except for a thin strip between the eyes which is lighter in color. The back of the Lavasoa dwarf lemur is reddish-brown at the neck which fades to gray-brown at the posterior end. The underside of the lemur is a cream color. Hands and feet are grey-brown in most individuals, but reddish-brown in a minority. Throughout the animal exhibits dichromatic hairs with gray bases. The Lavasoa dwarf lemur can be distinguished from the furry-eared dwarf lemur by its wider ears and smaller head. It can be distinguished from its closest relative, Cheirogaleus sp. Ranomafana Andrambovato, by these two traits plus a shorter tail. The coloration patterns are very similar between all three species. This coloration pattern contrasts with Lavasoa dwarf lemur's closest geographic neighbors, the greater dwarf lemur (C. major) and the fat-tailed dwarf lemur (C. medius). Behavior Like other dwarf lemurs, the Lavasoa dwarf lemur is nocturnal and arboreal, living in the upper canopy of the forest. During the dry winter, they hibernate for several months. Little is known about their behavior because they are primarily active during the rainy season, at which time the forests become challenging for scientists to reach. Distribution and habitat The Lavasoa dwarf lemur is endemic to the southern slopes of the Lavasoa Mountains in the Anosy Region of Madagascar. It is only found in three small fragmentary forests (Grand Lavasoa, Petit Lavasoa, and Ambatotsirongorongo), located within a transitional zone between dry spiny bush, humid littoral forest, and humid forest. Despite containing some flora from the drier regions, its habitat general resembles humid forests. Conservation status The three forest fragments in which the Lavasoa dwarf lemur is found used to be a part of a larger forest that once covered the southern range of the Lavasoa Mountains, as illustrated by aerial photographs from 1957. These remaining forest fragments are contained within a new protected area around Ambatotsirongorongo (Nouvelle Aire Protégée Ambatotsirongorongo), which is part of the national service of protected areas (Système des Aires Protégées de Madagascar, SAPM). Thiele et al. estimated that 50, maybe fewer, Lavasoa dwarf lemurs live within this range.

The system consists of two bright stars where the primary is orbited by two fainter stars, making it a quadruple with an unequal hierarchy.  Component discovery  A diagram of the visual components of the HD 41742/41700 system (Click to enlarge). HD 41742 B's motion relative to HD 41742 Aab (Click to enlarge). HD 41742 B was discovered early on in the history of visual binaries, due to the brightness of the primary. The earliest measurement in the Washington Double Star Catalog (WDS) dates to 1837 and was made by William Herschel, stating a position angle of 246° and a separation of 1.1\\" for the companion. Surprisingly, recent measures suggest that the secondary has moved significantly over the two centuries since, with it lying at a position angle of around 215° and a separation increasing between 5.30\\" in the late 1970s to 5.95\\" in 2010. This translates to a minimum change in physical separation between 142 and 159 AU over 35 years, which suggests that HD 41742 B is moving quickly away from the primary. Lying at a considerably wider separation, HD 41700 was first observed relative to HD 41742 later than the tighter binary, despite being much brighter. The first measurement in the WDS dates to 1854 and was again made by Herschel, giving a position angle of 320° and a separation of 174\\". More recent values agree on the position angle, but suggest a separation closer to 200\\". The wide separation of this tertiary component means that it has a separate Hipparcos entry to the primary, which confirms that the two stars lie at the same distance and are co-moving. The physical separation between the two is about 0.026 parsecs (0.084 light- years), or approximately 17200 AU. This is comparable to the ~15000 AU separation between Alpha Centauri AB and Proxima Centauri; such wide separations between components are relatively rare, at least for solar-type stars. An orbital fit to HD 41742 A's radial velocity (Click to enlarge). Radial velocity observations of HD 41742 A with the HARPS spectrograph detected variations on a level of several km/s over a period of months, indicating that the star is a single-lined spectroscopic binary (SB1). Though an orbital fit was not attempted, A good orbital fit is possible (left), which implies that HD 41742 Ab has a minimum mass of , and is on a high eccentricity ~222-day orbit around the primary. Given that the lines of the secondary are not detected, it must have a significantly lower luminosity than the primary, indicating that it is of late spectral type.  Properties  The position of HD 41742 AB and HD 41700 (C) on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram 20px 20px 20px On the celestial sphere, HD 41742/41700 can be seen as a 6th magnitude star (a magnitude barely observable by the naked eye under good conditions) lying close to the border between Puppis and Pictor. The nearest bright star to its location is the 4th magnitude Eta Columbae approximately two arcminutes to the north; The system lies about a quarter of the distance between Eta Columbae and Canopus (Alpha Carinae) on the sky. HD 41742 A and HD 41700 (C) are similar stars, with their colours indicating spectral types of F6 and F7.5; this means that the two stars are about 500 K hotter than the Sun, and in turn the difference in temperature between the stars is about 150 kelvins. The stars lie slightly below the main sequence on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (left image), which is probably due to their sub-solar metallicity (Fe/H ≈ −0.2). HD 41742 B is a much cooler star than the brighter components; its B-V indicates a spectral type of K3, making it approximately 1000 K cooler than the Sun. It lies on the main sequence on the HRD (left image), and its photometry is fully consistent with an dwarf. Indication of a young age for the HD 41742/41700 system was first found Henry et al. (1996), detecting large chromospheric activity in HD 41700; they measured a log R'HK of −4.35 for the star, significantly higher than a \\"quiet\\" value of < −4.70, indicating that the system is considerably younger than 1 Gyr. The brightest stars in the system are both moderately fast rotators for late-F dwarfs, again indicating that they are young. Finally, HD 41700 has a somewhat large lithium content; because lithium is used up by a star at an approximately constant rate over its lifetime, this can be used to estimate a star's age. For HD 41700, its lithium abundance indicates an age of 200 ± 50 million years. Some young star systems remain loosely associated with other stars that formed in the same molecular cloud as they move through space, known as a moving group. The HD 41742/41700 system has space velocities of (UVW) = −37.8, −10.4, −14.6 km/s, which is similar to those of the Hyades (UVW = −39.7, −17.7, −2.4 km/s); however, the system is probably not a Hyad because it has a lower peculiar velocity than expected, as well as a lower metallicity and lithium age than the Hyades. Another feature prevalent around young stars are debris disks. For HD 41742 A and HD 41700 (C), IRAS and ISO detected infra-red excesses, which are typically indicative of disks of material re-radiating absorbed light at redder wavelengths; however, in both cases evidence against the excesses have been found. For HD 41742 A, the excess is offset by 26\\", which is large enough so that contamination from another object is likely responsible for the excess, while for HD 41700 (C) the excess has not been confirmed by Spitzer observations.  Planet searches  HD 41700 (C) is included on the CORALIE and Keck-HIRES planet search samples. No variability has been announced so far, so the star likely does not host a close-in, easily detectable giant planet. HD 41742 A was included on a planet search around early-type (<~F7) stars with HARPS that detected its spectroscopic binarity, as discussed above.

Moravia was the first among the three historical regions of what now forms the Czech Republic whose ruling classes have officially adopted Christianity, between 830s and 860s. In 845 Bohemian chieftains or duces also converted to the new faith, but it was just short-lived political gesture (next year they returned to paganism); real beginning of efforts to promote Christianity in Bohemian territory have to be put to the period after 885. Moravia was the earliest center of Old Church Slavonic liturgy after the arrival of Constantine (Cyril) and Methodius in 863, but their opponents, mainly priests of German origin, achieved the banishment of their disciplines in the 880s. Bohemia became the center of Christianization following the fall of Moravia in the early 10th century. Changes in burials and the erection of churches throughout the Czech Lands demonstrate the spread of the new faith in the 10th century. Two dioceses (the bishoprics of Prague and Olomouc) came into being by the end of the 11th century, but the system of local parishes only strengthened in the 12th century. The dukes and wealthy noblemen also set up a number of Benedictine, Cistercian, and Premonstratensian monasteries in the 11th and 12th centuries. Early Middle Ages (till 976) =Early Slavs (before c. 830)= Archaeological finds with close analogies in Ukrainesunken huts with corner ovens, small cremation cemeteries, and \\"Prague pottery\\"suggests that the first Slavic-speaking groups settled in the lands now inhabited by the Czech people in the second half of the 6th century. Almost all information on early Slavic mythology and cults derives from sources first recorded in the late 10th century. According to these sources, the Czechs' ancestors worshipped Perun, Veles, and other deities of the Slavic pantheon. The remains of pagan cult sites, most of which have been excavated in Moravia, are \\"difficult to interpret.\\" For instance, finds at a cemetery at Mikulčice which was in use from the late 8th century to the middle of the 10th century point at the existence of a rite connected to horse burials. The earliest inhumation graves, dated to the 8th century, were also unearthed in this region. Fortifications at Mikulčice, Staré Město, and nearby settlements proves that important centers of power existed in the valley of the river Morava. Likewise around 800, strongholds were erected at Kouřim and other places in the Vltava river's valley in Bohemia. Charlemagne's biographer Einhard lists the \\"Bohemians\\" among the peoples with whom Charlemagne \\"had armed conflict.\\"Einhard: The Life of Charles the Emperor (ch. 15.), p. 35. The heads or duces of the Bohemian tribes agreed to pay tribute to the emperor in 805 and 806. Bohemian and Moravian emissaries participated at the Diet of Frankfurt in the Carolingian Empire in 822. =Beginnings (c. 830–c. 906)= Remains of a 9th-century church at Mikulčice The earliest Christian missionaries came to Moravia from the dioceses of Passau, Regensburg, and Salzburg. The Frankish aristocrats' way of life attracted the Moravian and Bohemian leaders who identified it with Christianity. The adoption of the new faith was initially the personal decision of individual aristocrats. Czech religious terminology also indicates the chieftains' preeminent role in Christianization. For instance, the Czech word for church (kostel) derived from Old High German kastel (\\"fortress\\") and the word for priest (kněz) from Common Slavonic kŭnędzĭ (\\"prince or chieftain\\"). Reginhar, bishop of Passau, baptized \\"all Moravians\\" and their prince, Mojmir I (r. c. 830–846) in 831, at least according to the Reports of the Bishops of Passau. Crosses from graves at fortresses suggest that most Moravian chieftains converted to Christianity by the 850s, but the Frankish prelates described the Church in Moravia as \\"coarse\\" at their synod of 852. Indeed, the pagan temple at Mikulčice which was in use till around 850 demonstrates that heathen cults survived the official adoption of the new faith. No objects connected to Christianity which can be dated to the period before the mid-9th century have been unearthed in Bohemia. The Annals of Fulda writes of \\"fourteen of the duces of the Bohemians\\" who visited Louis the German in Regensburg where they were baptised \\"on the octave of the Epiphany,\\" that is on January 13, 845.The Annals of Fulda (year 845), p. 24. The Czech chieftains hoped that their conversion could contribute to maintain the peace with the Franks, because they soon returned to paganism after Louis the German invaded the Christian Moravia and dethroned Mojmir I in 846. Sculpture of Saints Cyril and Methodius on Charles Bridge (Prague) Mojmir I's nephew and successor, Rastislav (r. 846–860) turned to the Holy See to ask for missionaries in 860. However, his request fell on deaf ears, so he sent emissaries to Constantinople with the same task. The Byzantine Emperor Michael III sent two brothers, Constantine and Methodius, who were fluent in Slavic, to Rastislav's realm. They arrived in Moravia in 863 or 864. They used the vernacular not only in education but also in liturgy which enabled them to strengthen the local element of the clergy. Constantine even created a new script fitted to Slavic phonology. The Byzantine missionaries' success caused conflicts with the Frankish prelates who accused the two brothers of heresy at the Holy See. On hearing this, Constantine and Methodius visited Rome where Pope Hadrian II sanctioned the use of Slavonic in liturgy and ordained their disciples as priests in 869. Constantine adopted the name Cyril and entered a monastery in Rome, but died on February 14, 869. Although the Pope consecrated Methodius as archbishop of Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica, Serbia), he was arrested by German prelates on his travel from Rome. He only returned to Moravia after Pope John VIII had in 873 achieved his release. According to his Life, Methodius received jurisdiction over all churches, most of which were located in fortresses, in Moravia. \\"Great\\" Moravia at its largest territorial expansion in the last year of Svatopluk I Moravia underwent a significant territorial expansion in the reign of Svatopluk I (r. 869–894). The Bohemian dukes also accepted his suzerainty from the 880s. According to a legend which was first recorded in the Life of Václav and Ludmilla around 994, Methodius personally baptized a Bohemian duke named Bořivoj I (r. 872–889) who was the head of the emerging Přemyslid dynasty. The duke soon had a church erected at Levý Hradec, but his subjects who insisted on paganism rose up and expelled him. Assisted by Svatopluk I, Bořivoj I returned to Bohemia and defeated his enemies around 885. He had a new church built at Prague Castle. Methodius died on April 6, 885. His opponents took advantage of his death and persuaded Pope Stephen V to forbid the use of the vernacular in liturgy. Svatopluk I soon expelled Methodius's disciples from his empire. Svatopuluk I died in 894. The Czechs soon rose up and accepted the suzerainty of King Arnulf of East Francia. Pope John IX sanctioned the establishment of an archbishopric and four suffragan bishoprics in Moravia in 898 upon the request of Svatopluk I's successor, Mojmir II. However, no report of the actual consecration of new Moravian prelates has been preserved. Moravia finally disintegrated after the arrival of the Hungarians who conquered its core territory between 903 and 906. A heathen sanctuary built on the ruins of a Christian church at Pohansko suggests that traditional Slavic cults revived following the fall of Moravia. =Christianization (c. 906–976)= Wenceslaus I and Ludmila depicted on a glass window in Sts. Cyril and Methodius's church in Olomouc Spytihněv I, Duke of Bohemia (r. 894–915) played a preeminent role in the evolution of the Church organization. He had a number of fortresses erected which became important centers of both secular and ecclesiastic administration. The First Latin Legend of Wenceslas refers to a \\"greater priest\\" (maior presbyter) who seems to have represented the bishop of Regensburg in Bohemia. The same source states that Bavarian and Swabian priests arrived in the reign of Wenceslaus I (921–935), but many priests known from this periodincluding Krastĕj at Stará Boleslav and Učen at Budečbore Slavic names which implies that they came from Moravia. Wenceslaus I's grandmother Ludmila became the first local saint. She had been murdered in 921 because of her conflicts with her daughter-in-law, Drahomíra (Wenceslaus's mother). Her cult began around 925 in the reign of her grandson. Wenceslaus I who was murdered by his own brother's servants also became a subject of veneration. He was regarded as \\"eternal prince\\" of Bohemia from the end of the century. The legends of Wenceslaus I and his grandmother are among the first works of local literature. The parallel use of Latin and Old Church Slavonic in a religious context is a remarkable feature of these texts. For instance, the earliest legend of Wenceslaus was written in Latin in the 960s, but its Old Church Slavonic version also appeared in short time. Wenceslaus's brother Boleslaus I (r. 935–972) defeated a number of Bohemian dukes who opposed his rule, erected new fortresses all over Bohemia, and conquered significant parts of Moravia, Silesia, and other territories. Cosmas of Prague reports that Boleslaus I \\"built twenty churches for the Christian religion\\"Cosmas of Prague: The Chronicle of the Czechs (1.22.), p. 71. in his reign. Churches from the second half of the century have been found at Dobřichov, Plzeň, and other settlements. The earliest churches in Bohemia were wooden constructions. The church dedicated to the Virgin at Prague Castle was the first to have been built of stone. Boleslaus I ordered that markets be held on Sundays in his forts in order to persuade his subjects to attend Sunday Mass. Pope John XIII authorized him to establish two bishoprics in his realm in 962, but Michael, Bishop of Regensburg, prevented the division of his diocese. Cosmas of Prague narrates that the Pope forbade Slavic liturgy in his letter to Boleslaus II, but the credibility of this report has been challenged. Changes in burials reflect the spread of Christianity in Bohemia in the 10th century. The growing number of traditional tumuli used for inhumation instead of cremation demonstrates that pagan and Christian customs co-existed. Likewise, the custom of placing eggs or other foodstuffs in graves survived up until the early 11th century even in \\"row cemeteries\\" which appeared in the late 9th century. Boleslaus II (r. 967–999) established a monastery (the St. George's Convent) for Benedictine nuns in Prague. Its first abbess Mlada was his sister, who represented him in his discussions with the Holy See on the establishment of the Czech bishoprics. The two dioceses, of Prague and Moravia, were finally set up in 975. Their bishops became suffragans of the archbishops of Mainz. Middle Ages (976–c. 1410) =Development of church structure (976–c. 1200)= Saint Adalbert's martyrdom among the pagan Prussians depicted on the doors of the Gniezno Cathedral (Poland) A member of the powerful Slavník dynasty, Adalbert, became the bishop of Prague around 983. Emperor Henry IV's diploma of 1086 (the text of which has been preserved by Cosmas of Prague) describes the boundaries of Bishop Adalbert's diocese. According to the diploma, Bishop Adalbert's jurisdiction included both Bohemia and Moravia, which suggests that the see of Moravia had meanwhile been dissolved. The diploma states that parts of Silesia, Lesser Poland (including Cracow), and modern Slovakia also belonged to the bishopric in the late 10th century. Bishop Adalbert attempted to strengthen Christian values in his diocese, for instance by condemning polygamy. However, he failed in his efforts and departed his see for Italy in 988 or 989. He only returned to Prague upon the request of Boleslaus II in 992. In next year the duke and the bishop jointly established Břevnov Monastery for Benedictine monks. Bishop Adalbert again left for Rome just before the massacre of his kinsmen by the duke in 995. Adalbert himself suffered martyrdom among the pagan Prussians in 997. His canonization was initiated in 999 by Emperor Otto III. Saint Wenceslas Cathedral at Olomouc Saint Adalbert's relics were initially buried in the Gniezno Cathedral in Poland, but they were translated by force to Prague under Duke Bretislaus I (r. 1035–1055). On this occasion, in 1039, the duke issued decrees which prescribed the general observance of Christian customs, including the prohibition of working on Sundays and on feast days and a ban on burials outside Christian graveyards. The separate diocese for Moravia, with its seat in Olomouc, was restored under Duke Vratislaus II (r. 1061–1092), although his brother Bishop Jaromír of Prague (r. 1068–1090) made every effort to hinder the dismemberment of his diocese. Likewise, the establishment of the wealthy Vyšehrad Chapter around 1070, which was directly subordinated to the Holy See, diminished the power of the bishops of Prague. On the other hand, a large basilica dedicated to St. Vitus was erected on the site of an earlier rotunda at Prague which served as the new see of the bishopric. A new cathedral was built at Olomouc under Bishop Jindřich Zdík (r. 1126–1150) who moved his see to the castle in the town. Bretislaus I's decrees of 1039 make references to archpriests and archdeacons which points at the existence of large parishes with their seats in strongholds. The development of the local church system accelerated after a papal legate Cardinal Guido obliged the two Czech bishops to determine the boundaries of the parishes in their dioceses in 1143. The erection of new cathedrals contributed to the development of cathedral chapters which were organized in accordance with the ideas of contemporary canon law, including celibacy. However, marriage and concubinage remained widespread among the lower clergy up until the end of the 12th century. Cardinal Guido even wrote of clergymen \\"found bigamous or married to widows or repudiated women.\\" In the 11th and 12th centuries a number of new monasteries were founded in the Czech Lands, most of them by the dukes. Sázava Monastery which was established around 1032 became a significant center of Slavic literature, but its German abbot had all Slavic books destroyed in 1097. Further Benedictine abbeys were established up until the middle of the 12th century when new religious orders arrived and became popular in the Czech Lands. The Cistercians were first settled at Sedlec Abbey upon the initiative of a Czech nobleman named Miroslav in 1142 or 1143. The first Premonstratensian house was set up at Strahov in 1143 or 1144.

Before that he was affiliated with that university's Research Institute for Symbolic Computation (RISC). Kauers studied computer science at the University of Karlsruhe in Germany from 1998 to 2002 and then moved to RISC, where he completed his PhD in symbolic computation in 2005 under the supervision of Peter Paule. He earned his habilitation in mathematics from JKU in 2008. Together with Doron Zeilberger and Christoph Koutschan, Kauers proved two famous open conjectures in combinatorics using large scale computer algebra calculations. Both proofs appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The first concerned a conjecture formulated by Ira Gessel on the number of certain lattice walks restricted to the quarter plane. This result was later generalized by Alin Bostan and Kauers when they showed, also using computer algebra, that the generating function for these walks is algebraic. The second conjecture proven by Kauers, Koutschan and Zeilberger was the so-called q-TSPP conjecture, a product formula for the orbit generating function of totally symmetric plane partitions, which was formulated by George Andrews and David Robbins in the early 1980s. In 2009, Kauers received the Start-Preis, which is considered the most prestigious award for young scientists in Austria.

Unlike many other polymers and fibers, it is heat-, sunlight-, and weather-resistant. This type of tape is also described, particularly in the United States, as \\"self-fusing\\", or \\"self-vulcanizing\\". In the US Air Force (and elsewhere) it is called centerline tape due to a colored line running down the center used to assist with even wrapping. It is also called \\"F4\\", \\"tommy\\", \\"rescue\\", \\"Tape 69\\" \\"magic tape\\", and \\"fix-it tape\\". Description While not adhesive to the repaired object, it is self- adhesive, securing the bond well. It is supplied in rolls with an interleaving layer, to prevent the tape from amalgamating before use. It may optionally be made with an iron-oxide additive which adds high thermal conductivity. This tape is used extensively in aviation and aerospace wiring applications as a splice or wrapping tape due to its non-flammability. It can be used for emergency repair of leaking low-pressure hoses and pipes. Compared to most other electrical and utility tapes, centerline tape is not particularly tough mechanically. Silicone rubber feels soft and is also susceptible to cuts and abrasion, having low tear resistance. This weakness is made worse because this tape is wrapped while stretched, and remains under internal tension even while fused, so that any nicks or cuts may start to tear and expand without additional external tension.Robinson Rubber – Polymer & Material Selection Guide, 2005, (PDF) - Limitations in performance of silicone rubber includes abrasion resistance, impact resistance, and tear resistance. However, these same properties, combined with the lack of traditional gum adhesive, make tape removal, if needed, quick, clean, and easy. Another form of self-amalgamating tape is made from ethylene propylene rubber (EPR) and has similar uses as silicone self-amalgamating tape but is non-vulcanising and has good moisture resistance. It is primarily used for insulating moisture sealing joints, splices and connections in electrical cables up to high voltages. A similar tape, PIB (polyisobutylene) rubber self-amalgamating tape, is used for more general purpose electrical lower voltage sealing and insulating cable applications.

Gallieni's campaign however was halted when Đề Thám attacked the railway, seizing trains, supplies and even capturing a local official for ransom. Against Gallieni's wishes, the French authorities agreed to make peace, granting Đề Thám a regional fiefdom. This made him the rallying cry for other anti-French movements. Subsequent military campaigns chipped away at the fiefdom but Đề Thám's exploits and fame proved to be a thorn in the flank of the Protectorate well into the 20th century. Đề Thám's rule came to an end when he was killed in Thái Nguyên on 10 February (or March 18) 1913 at the hands of one of his men, Lương Tam Kỳ; Kỳ was a former Black Flag Army commander who later turned, working as a spy for the French.

It was founded in 1977 and disbanded in 1994, with most of its assets transferring to the University of Michigan Bentley Historical Library, Affirmations LGBT community center of Ferndale, and the Triangle Foundation—which replaced MOHR as the state's LGBT civil rights organization (today known as Equality Michigan). Activities Although civil rights for lesbians and gay men were not intended to be the sole focus of the organization, an early goal of the organization was to focus on educational materials and legal advice concerning issues surrounding sexual orientation. In addition to political work, including managing a PAC, the organization also hosted LGBT community building events. =Political advocacy= Some of MOHR's political accomplishments include several court cases involving the rights of lesbian mothers and the rights of people living with HIV. Lobbying of the Michigan legislature resulted in increased funding for AIDS research, education, and care. The organization also lobbied several Michigan municipalities for domestic partnership and non-discrimination ordinances. =Education= MOHR utilized radio and cable television as a means of informing the public about issues concerning discrimination based on sexual orientation and about the prevention and treatment of AIDS. =Another Voice= In 1973, WDET in Detroit began airing a weekly radio program, \\"Gayly Speaking,\\" which continued until 1982 when it was replaced with \\"Another Voice,\\" a new program produced by MOHR. As Detroit's first radio program \\"by, for, and about gays and gay liberation,\\" the program focused on such topics as coming out, oppression, religion, and gays in film, theater, literature, and music. Programs included a news and announcement segment and often featured prominent organizations and events, such as Gay Pride Week, Detroit's Gay Community Center, and the Gay Switchboard. =Michigan Human Rights Campaign Committee= The Michigan Human Rights Campaign Committee was established in 1985 as a political action committee serving the interest of Michigan's LGBT community. The name was changed to Pride PAC in 1995, later to Triangle Pride PAC, and is today known as the Equality Michigan Pride PAC. =Michigan Organization for Human Rights March= In 1986, Craig Covey and MOHR organized the Michigan Organization for Human Rights March, Michigan’s first gay and lesbian march in Detroit. From 1986-1988, the civil rights march took place down Woodward Avenue followed by a rally at Kennedy Square. A party took place at the McGregor Center on the campus of Wayne State University following the rally, organized by a small number of dedicated gay and lesbian groups and volunteers. In 1989, the Gay and Lesbian civil rights march was moved to the more central location of Lansing to attract statewide participation and political awareness as well as to celebrate the 20th anniversary of New York City’s Stonewall Riots. =Michigan Privacy Challenge= One of MOHR's most successful projects from 1988 to 1990 was the Michigan Privacy Challenge, a series of lawsuits filed by the organization on behalf of individual plaintiffs that challenged the constitutionality of Michigan's sodomy and gross indecency laws. The Wayne County Circuit Court's decision in 1990 supported MOHR's position and was not appealed by the State of Michigan. Michigan Organization for Human Rights v. Kelley Michigan's crime against nature and gross indecency laws were briefly overturned in Wayne County by Michigan Organization for Human Rights v. Kelley when MOHR won the case in Michigan's Wayne County Circuit Court on July 9, 1990. While the state did not appeal the ruling, the laws were upheld, in a 10-3 vote, by the Michigan Court of Appeals, in People v. Brashier on December 29, 1992, effectively reversing MOHR v. Kelly. History =Founding= After a series of meetings of community leaders in Detroit in the summer of 1977, the Michigan Organization for Human Rights (MOHR) was founded at an organizing conference attended by 50 people and held in Lansing, Michigan, on October 15 and 16, 1977. The mission of the organization was broadly conceived, so that it could serve as a resource for the numerous local, state, and national human rights organizations engaged in efforts to eliminate discrimination. =Growth= In its early years, MOHR meetings rotated around the state, primarily being held in Southeast Michigan. In September 1978, a staffed office was established in Detroit and an executive director was hired to guide the organization's lobbying, outreach, and fundraising efforts. By 1979, the funding of a staffed office and time commitments required for MOHR work were causing unforeseen pressures on both the organization and those who directed it. The resulting resignation of the first executive director led to the first in a series of reorganizations. MOHR's dependence on financial contributions from its constituent organizations proved untenable and, by the early 1980s, the organization had shifted its primary fundraising efforts to individuals. In 1985, the organization hired an Executive Director from Ohio, Craig Covey, in part because of the large and successful Gay and Lesbian civil rights marches he organized in Columbus—which would be helpful later when the organization organized a gay and lesbian march. =Conflicts and closure= While the Michigan Privacy Challenge (1988–90) was helping advance the organization's policy efforts, internal problems continued with personality conflicts and disagreements over financial commitments and priorities. The latter half of the 1980s included frequent resignations, reform proposals, and dire predictions from factions of the board of directors. These struggles resulted in decreased support from the organization's constituents and funders. Decreased supported, combined with the founding of new lesbian and gay social and political organizations in Southeast Michigan, resulted in the organization being less effective in their political and fundraising efforts. After one final reorganization attempt, the Michigan Organization for Human Rights disbanded in the spring of 1994. Many of the organization's assets, including their offices, were transferred to Triangle Foundation (today Equality Michigan) as the organization added public policy advocacy to their existing anti-violence work. Many board members, including Henry D. Messer and John Monahan, also joined Triangle Foundation. Most of their community support efforts became a part of the work of Affirmations, the LGBT community center in Ferndale, Michigan. The archives of MOHR were transferred to the Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Bentley has gone on to house the historical archives of many of Michigan's LGBT organizations, including Affirmations, Triangle Foundation, and Equality Michigan.

According to The New York Times, the Bronx court system had 3,880 felony cases awaiting trial as of November 2013, of which 397 were older than two years. This accounted for over 47% of the total open felony cases older than two years in the New York City court system. Accused persons who are denied bail must remain in jail while awaiting trial, with some spending five years or more in pre-trial detention. Several explanations have been offered for the backlog of cases. One factor may be the economic condition of the Bronx, which is cumulatively the poorest of New York City's borough, thereby lacking \\"political clout to stir outrage and force reform\\". Some critics contend that high numbers of arrests in the borough, particularly for misdemeanor offenses, are the underlying source of the problem. Others believe that criminal attorneys deliberately delay trial proceedings, for example by routinely showing up late, or by employing time- wasting cross-examinations. In January 2013, judges from neighboring court districts were enlisted to help work through the case backlog, in a strategy termed \\"blockbuster\\". New York State chief judge Jonathan Lippman was quoted as saying the extra personnel working Bronx cases would eliminate the backlog within six months. Although the number of cases settled or brought to trial did increase during this time, The New York Times reported that as of July 2013, the number of outstanding cases remained \\"the largest in New York City — more than Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island combined.\\" Examples In one case that received media attention, Michael Ikoli was charged with murder, accused of shooting two people at a roller-skating rink with a friend in 2004. He waited in Rikers Island for five years without a trial because of the backlog in the Bronx courts; it wasn't until October 2009 when the New York Daily News exposed the case as part of a story on the severe backlog of felony cases in the Bronx courts when his case was fast-tracked for trial, and in December 2009 he was acquitted of all charges when his trial ended. In May 2011, Ikoli was shot to death in the Bronx in a gang-related shooting.

From 1912 to 1937 he was editor of The Chinese Recorder and Missionary Journal, published in Shanghai, the leading English language journal of the Protestant missionary community. Early life and the \\"Call to China\\" Frank and his younger brother came to the United States in 1889 as steerage passengers and settled in Baltimore. Frank joined a Southern Baptist church, where he met Carrie Mae Dietz. He graduated summa cum laude from Bucknell University, in Pennsylvania in 1899, and quickly married Carrie Mae. In 1903 he graduated from Rochester Theological Seminary, was ordained, and became an American citizen. In 1894, when the Student Volunteer Movement (SVM) organized campaigns, he had stood up at a meeting organized by a missionary from China and said \\"Here I am Lord! Send me!\\" In 1900 when John R. Mott of the SVM spoke, he heard \\"The Call\\" again, and successfully applied to be appointed as a missionary for the Southern Baptist Convention. He, his wife, and his son arrived in Shanghai on October 16, 1902 and began work with the Central China Mission. In June 1911, Rawlinson was appointed Assistant Editor on the editorial board of The Chinese Recorder, and in 1914, joined the executive committee of the China Continuation Committee, which was formed to carry out in China the work of the 1910 World Missionary Conference. In 1913 he became editor-in-chief of the Recorder, a post which he retained until his death. In 1916, the family returned to American on the Japanese steamer Shinyo Maru for furlough. Shortly after Christmas, Carrie Mae slipped on the ice, fractured her hip, and on January 7, 1917, died from a blood infection. Frank's grief was compounded when the family Baptist church refused to allow a non-Baptist friend deliver the eulogy. On the steamer from Shanghai, the family had struck up a friendship with Florence Lang, who was herself returning from Bombay, where she worked as General Secretary of the YWCA. Florence and Frank renewed their friendship, and Frank soon wrote her that he thanked God for his \\"resurrection.\\" Although the Southern Baptist Board had reservations as to whether she was capable of representing Baptist values in China, they were married July 29, 1917. Their son, John Lang Rawlinson, was born in 1920. During the furlough year, Frank earned an M.A. from Teachers College, Columbia University, where he took courses on schools and religious education. Bucknell awarded him an honorary D.D. Upon his return to China in 1918, he resumed a busy schedule. He lectured at the Nanking University School for Missionaries, and after 1921 was a lecturer at the North China Union Language School in Beijing. Lecturing to new missionaries on how to adapt to Chinese culture led Rawlinson to read the Chinese classics. In addition to Confucius and Mozi he read modern Chinese scholars such as Liang Qichao and Hu Shih. Physically and spiritually happy in his new marriage, he began to develop a more favorable understanding of Chinese religions, especially Buddhism. Although he was often away from home, Frank and Florence conducted extensive discussions on family, their relationship, and theology by letters. In one letter he compared her to \\"the smile of God,\\" but explained that he found his faith moving away from its evangelical foundations. He described his Call as \\"a vision of human need that has never left me..., (but) it is true that I have changed my ideas on how to meet it.\\" Social Gospel, nationalism, and revolution After World War I, the New Culture Movement advocated a scientific approach to politics and religion, and began to oppose foreign influence in China. At the same time, an influential group of Protestant missionaries in China worked to build what the historian Daniel Bays calls a \\"Sino-foreign Protestant Establishment\\" which saw Chinese nationalism and Chinese Christianity as working together to build a modern and independent nation. Rawlinson was a leader in this group. As Rawlinson read more widely in Chinese classics and Buddhist texts, which he now could read in Chinese, he began attacking the dogmatism of the mission community and the public at home. Chinese ideas of God, he told his students, might possibly compare favorably with early Hebrew ideas. Christians should not denounce Buddhist conceptions of love, compassion, and self-sacrifice but realize their strength. President John Leighton Stuart of Yenching University offered Rawlinson a position teaching Christian apologetics in 1920, but it fell through because his Southern Baptist mission board declined to fund it. Rawlinson was a founding member of the Yenching Life Fellowship Movement sponsored by Christian faculty members. Chinese Recorder published a number of articles from this group who were working for dialogue between Chinese intellectuals and Christians and for a Chinese Christian Church which would be \\"of the Chinese, for the Chinese and by the Chinese.\\" The Chinese Recorder under Rawlinson's editorship became a forum for debate on theological questions and the political claims of Chinese nationalism. The journal sought out articles by and about Chinese intellectuals and commissioned translations to present important thinking on politics and religion. For instance, the May 1920 issue of the journal included \\"Christianity and the Chinese People,\\" by Chen Duxiu, who would be the co-founder of the Chinese Communist Party.Ch'en Tu-hsiu, \\"Christianity and the Chinese People,\\" The Chinese Recorder (May 1920) Pearl S. Buck, for instance, in 1927, well before she became famous, published an article \\"Is There A Place for the Foreign Missionary?\\" Later, her resignation under pressure from the Presbyterian Board in 1932 troubled him. These liberal views antagonized the Southern Baptist Mission Board, at that time in the beginning of the controversy between modernist and fundamentalist conceptions of theology and the role of missions. The Board objected to the fact that Rawlinson edited an interdenominational journal, not a Baptist one. In 1921 the Board dismissed him. Rawlinson acknowledged to Florence that this was a \\"hard kick,\\" but reported that he had \\"not yet been kicked very far.\\" The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, which supported interdenominational work, accepted Rawlinson in 1922. Rawlinson was one of the prime organizers of the National Christian Conference held in Shanghai in May 1922. The Conference surveyed the state of Christianity in China, pushed for Chinese control of Christian institutions, and set up the National Christian Council of China to carry out this program. He supported Chinese Christian leaders such as Cheng Jingyi, who led the Council. Cheng and other leaders aimed to develop a Chinese Christianity which was not based on independent denominations but on a unified church. Rawlinson edited the Council's Chinese Christian Yearbook from 1922. Confucian teachings continued to attract him, and he confessed in a letter to Florence that \\"I am something of a pagan.\\" From 1924 to 1925 Rawlinson studied and lectured as a McFadden Mission Fellow at Union Theological Seminary in New York. On his return to China he found that Chinese politics had become even more nationalistic and anti-Christian. Kenneth Scott Latourette, the leading scholar of missions at the time, reflected a feeling shared among liberal missionaries such as Rawlinson that the Church had \\"become a partner in Western imperialism and could not well disavow some responsibility for the consequences.\\" In 1926, Rawlinson published Chinese Ideas of the Supreme Being and in 1927 his most important work, Naturalization of Christianity in China. The motivation behind both was to meet the arguments of the hot Chinese nationalists and anti-Christians who attacked the church as irredeemably imperialist and irrational and to convince his fellow mission Christians to cede authority not only over the institutional church, a process which was already well under way, but to also cede the authority to define who was a Christian and what was Christian doctrine. The book drew from his years of talking to Chinese intellectuals and lecturing to newly arrived missionaries. He prepared the arguments for the book in a series of editorials. He first argued that being a Christian was not a matter of church membership -- \\"a Christian is one who loves Christ. Nothing more, nothing less.\\" Next, he challenged critics who claimed that China lacked the capacity to organize, citing in rebuttal the record of imperial China in organizing and administering its large territory. Nor did he accept the argument that Chinese cared little for morality or the individual, since the philosophies of Daoism and Buddhism did so, and Chinese family values were exemplary. He pointed out that the ancient Chinese had stated the Golden Rule long before Jesus. In short, a Chinese Christianity was possible but the main obstacle was Western refusal to accept Chinese as equals and recognize the strength of Chinese culture, The burden was on the Christian church to itself become Chinese: ::Christianity will not be naturalized in China until the Christian ideal of equality is embodied in the attitudes and conditions of Christian work in such ways as the actual as well as the potential moral equality of the Chinese is so unmistakably recognized that the Chinese have no doubt about it. In the end, Rawlinson concluded that a Christianity naturalized to China would leave denominations and sectarianism behind and not even cling to Christian ideas of salvation. Rawlinson argued that Christianity could not succeed in China if it was identified with either imperialist domination or capitalist exploitation. In particular, he pointed out that it was \\"somewhat humiliating\\" to force China to grant permission for \\"Christian aliens\\" to build churches and propagate their religion under protection of extraterritoriality. He welcomed Chinese colleagues into the leadership of Christian institutions and supported the anti-imperialist program of the Chinese Nationalist Party. The spread of Marxism raised serious questions, however. Rawlinson approved the egalitarian social aims which Chinese communists announced while condemning their violent methods. In 1934, the Chinese Recorder ran a series of articles on \\"The Challenge of Communism,\\" the title of a missionary conference. Rawlinson conceded that if it sought a \\"juster and more equitable social order,\\" communism was supportable. In that year, Chiang Kai-shek launched his New Life Movement as an answer to communism's social appeal. Rawlinson applauded, but looked to the Rural Reconstruction Movement for a Christian approach to the problems of China's rural majority. Rawlinson's June 1934 editorial, \\"Beyond Communism,\\" reminded readers that as doctrine Christianity was \\"adverse\\" to capitalism but in fact had accommodated to it easily enough. Now Christianity found that communism had \\"stolen its thunder,\\" for Christianity had never set out to \\"change the entire lot of the underprivileged as communism has.\\" Christianity was preferable to communism but had to prove itself in action. The outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War posed a challenge to the Christian missionary. In what turned out to be Rawlinson's last letter to his children on August 3, 1937, he told them \\"I do not like war. I feel that it is unChristian,\\" yet \\"I don't know what else China can do but resist Japan unless she wants to become practically a Japanese colony.\\" . On August 14, 1937 a Chinese fighter plane, damaged by anti-aircraft fire from a Japanese battleship in the river, accidentally dropped a bomb onto a crowded Shanghai street, killing over 1,500 people. Rawlinson was among them. The New York Times reported his death on the front page. \\" Life Magazine ran a group of pictures of Rawlinson and his wife and called him \\"one of the most influential white men in China,\\" commenting that Rawlinson \\"felt China could take Christianity without ceasing to be Chinese.\\"The Camera Oversees: Shanghai Bombs,\\" Life August 30, 1937 Selected works * .

It was directed by Chris Wedge, in his live-action directorial debut, and written by Derek Connolly, from a story by Jonathan Aibel, Glenn Berger and Matthew Robinson. The film stars Lucas Till, Jane Levy, Amy Ryan, Rob Lowe, Danny Glover, Barry Pepper and Holt McCallany, and follows a high schooler who finds an escaped monster living in his truck. Principal photography of the film began on April 4, 2014, in Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada. It was released by Paramount Pictures in the United States on January 13, 2017, and received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Monster Trucks grossed $64 million worldwide against its $125 million budget, leading it to be labeled as a box-office bomb, losing the studio over $120 million. Plot Terravex Oil is in the midst of a fracking operation near a lake in North Dakota, overseen by CEO Reece Tenneson and geologist Jim Dowd. The operation releases three subterranean creatures from an underground water system and destroys the drilling rig. Two are captured by Terravex, but one of them escapes the site. Meanwhile, high school senior Tripp Coley is looking for something to do to escape the life of his family; his parents are divorced, his mother Cindy is in a relationship with Rick, the town's sheriff, who fails to take him seriously. That is why he has taken up a part-time job at a local junkyard, where he builds a pickup truck in hopes of being able to leave his town. But the truck doesn't have a working drivetrain to put his plans to action. One night, Tripp encounters the escaped creature in the junkyard and captures it, but the creature escapes before he can seek authorities. The next day Tripp, along with classmate Meredith (who is tutoring Tripp in biology), finds the creature has a diet of oil and it takes shelter within the hood of his truck. He quickly befriends him, names him Creech, and promises to help him get home. Tripp modifies the truck to give Creech more control over the truck as a makeshift engine, the truck essentially acting as a 'wheelchair' for Creech to operate on land, and Meredith becomes quite impressed and surprised at Creech's speed and talent. Meanwhile, Tenneson is still concerned about the incident at the drilling rig that exposed Creech, since similar experiments have revealed the existence of other creatures. He decides to protect the company's image by drilling poison into a hole leading to the underwater tunnels, and by sending hired mercenary Burke to kill their captured creatures, to the objection of Jim, as he finds the monsters have significant intelligence and emotions, as well as a hive mind intelligence that allows both of the captured specimens to learn what was only directly taught to one. Tripp and Meredith go see Tripp's father Wade to seek help, but Wade sells Tripp out to Burke. Tripp and Meredith escape in the truck with Creech, but not before destroying Wade's trailer. Tripp, Meredith and Creech are chased by Burke and his team along with Rick. Tripp, Meredith and Creech manage to escape by jumping over a train, and camp at a hunting cabin owned by Meredith's father near the lake, while Rick chastises Burke for attempting to follow them himself. When Creech gets the sense something bad will happen to the other creatures, he heads to the Terravex headquarters where the other creatures are being held captive. Tripp and Meredith follow Creech using Meredith's cellphone, as Tripp left his phone in the truck. When they arrive, they find Creech's parents, but are attacked by Terravex workers. Creech arrives and is captured; Tripp and Meredith are taken to Tenneson, and he tells them to forget about Creech along with his parents and has Burke escort them out. Sympathetic to the creatures' plight, Jim decides to help Tripp and Meredith rescue the creatures. With the help of Tripp's junkyard boss, Mr. Weathers, they acquire two more trucks, one being a repossession from a rich teen who had failed to make payments, and another being the birthday present of his friend Sam Geldon, whose father owns a local car dealership. They modify the trucks for Creech's parents to control similar to Creech in Tripp's truck. Jim helps the group by stealing the Terravex truck on which the monsters, Creech's parents, are loaded on. At the dealership, the creatures take control of the modified trucks based on Creech's own experience, and the group make their escape up the mountain leading to the tunnels. Terravex gives chase up the mountain and the group escape by using the trucks to jump over the edge of the mountain. On the way, Rick helps Tripp and the group escape from Burke, preventing Burke from ramming them off the road and later stealing a large truck to block the road to prevent further pursuit. After realizing the poison has been inserted, Tripp gets into a head- on battle with Burke, who attempts to push him into the drilling hole, but ends when Tripp and Creech overturn Burke's truck, destroying the poison machine and killing Burke when his truck is thrown into the equipment, only for Tripp to fall into the hole. Creech saves him from drowning before he and his parents depart back home and Terravex is exposed by the group for the experimentation that was harming the creatures' habitat. Tenneson is arrested for his crimes, Tripp and Rick develop on good terms and together build a new engine for the truck, and Tripp and Meredith begin a relationship.

It was painted between the years 1946 and 1947, and is the principal work of the Museo Mural Diego Rivera adjacent to the Alameda in the historic center of Mexico City. History The mural was originally created at the request of architect Carlos Obregón Santacilia for the Versailles Restaurant of the Hotel Del Prado, which was located across the street. When the hotel was rendered uninhabitable in the 1985 Mexico City earthquake and condemned for demolition, the mural was restored and moved to its own museum.Hotel del Prado Description The mural depicts famous people and events in the history of Mexico, passing through the Alameda Central park in Mexico City. Some notable figures include Frida Kahlo, José Guadalupe Posada, Francisco I. Madero, Benito Juárez, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, Porfirio Díaz, Agustín de Iturbide, Ignacio Manuel Altamirano, Maximilian I of Mexico, Juan de Zumárraga, Antonio López de Santa Anna, Winfield Scott, Victoriano Huerta, José Martí, Manuel Gutiérrez Nájera, Hernán Cortés, Nicolás Zúñiga y Miranda, and La Malinche. The central focus of the mural is on a display of bourgeois complacency and values shortly before the Mexican Revolution of 1910. Elegantly dressed upper- class figures promenade under the figure of the long ruling dictator Porfirio Díaz. An indigenous family is forced back by police batons and to the right flames and violence loom. To the far left, victims of the Inquisition, wearing the penitential sanbenito robes and the conical coroza hat, are consigned to the flames at an auto-da-fé. The center of the mural is dominated by the elegantly dressed skeleton La Calavera Catrina holding arms with the Mexican graphic artist who first conceived and drew her, José Guadalupe Posada in a black suit and cane. La Catrina wears a Feathered Serpent boa around her shoulders. On La Catrina's right she is holding hands with a child version of Diego Rivera in short pants. Rivera's wife Frida Kahlo is standing just behind and between him and La Catrina; Kahlo has her hand on Rivera's shoulder and she is holding a yin-yang device. La Malinche and Posada are staring directly into each other's eyes.Dream of a Sunday afternoon The actual mural located at Museo Mural Diego Rivera in Alameda Park, Mexico City.

Background and history Following years of Capcom using their proprietary MT Framework engine for video game development during the seventh generation of hardware, it was decided that to maximize productivity in the following generation of hardware it would be necessary to create a new development engine, now titled \\"Panta Rhei\\". This was intended for home consoles while games for Smartphones, PlayStation Vita and Nintendo 3DS still use the MT Framework Mobile & Lite engines. Specific design aims for the new engine included increases in workflow efficiency by reducing iteration time for modifications to gameplay and game design. Additionally, the engine introduced improved physical modeling of fluids and emphasis on global illumination rendering. Development of a new engine began in summer 2011. Features of the new development engine included: in-engine management of shader (GPU) programs; an engine virtual machine allowing game scripting to be written initially in C#; changes in organization of the workflow/content meant that backwards compatibility with the MT Framework engine was lost.Panta Rhei engine, Pt.1(game.watch.impress.co.jp) p.1. (japanese) The engine corresponds to DirectX 11 level of technology.Panta Rhei engine, Pt.1 (game.watch.impress.co.jp) p.3. (japanese) The initial game to be developed with Panta Rhei was Deep Down, whose team provided feedback on the engine development; development of the game and engine were carried out in parallel.Panta Rhei engine, Pt.1 (game.watch.impress.co.jp) p.2. (japanese) A trailer for Deep Down and the Panta Rhei engine were publicly demonstrated by Yoshinori Ono at the PlayStation 4 unveiling event in February 2013., the Deep Down technology demo used ~3GB of textures, with 30 shaders, running at approximately 30 frames per second. Graphics techniques used in the Deep Down demo included tessellation (actors cloak); with deferred rendering implementing dynamic lightsources; and surfaces rendered including diffuse and specular light reflections with surface roughness implemented by the Oren–Nayar reflectance model; global illumination calculations (such as light from a dragon's fiery breath) were estimated using the 'voxel cone tracing' method (with 1 specular 'ray' and an approximation to 12 dodecahedrally situated 'rays', sampled at a lower resolution, for diffuse reflectance); moving light sources including flames were modeled using a 64x64x64 voxel (voxel cube size ~0.5m) implemented as 3D textures stored in a Mipmap like structure.Panta Rhei engine, Pt.1 (game.watch.impress.co.jp) p.2-5. (japanese) Further technology demos showcasing fluid simulations of fire and smoke in the Panta Rhei engine were released in August 2013. The tech demo demonstrated the engine's use of volume-based simulations of fire (also used in the February 2013 Deep Down video), as opposed to less functional 2D \\"billboarded\\" (see Sprite) based depictions. The demos used a volume (voxel) based physical simulation of the fluid, with fixed voxel size. The simulation of fluid flow used a semi-Lagrangian method for approximations to the solution of the advection equation - specifically vorticity confinement simulations with the MacCormack method used to obtain solutions.Panta Rhei engine, Pt.2 (game.watch.impress.co.jp) p.1. (japanese) The voxel representation of the fluid required a 'ray marching' graphics rendering process (see Volume ray casting); self-shadowing of fluids, and scattering were also implemented in the engine demos.Panta Rhei engine, Pt.2 (game.watch.impress.co.jp) p.2. (japanese) Further details of the game engine were discussed at a talk at CEDEC (CESA Developers Conference) 2014 given by Hitoshi Mishima (三嶋 仁) and Haruna Akuzawa (阿久澤陽菜). In common with other PS4/Xbox One generation rendering engines the Panta Rhei engine used physically based rendering methods for calculating lighting reflectance; demonstrations based around the Deep Down Panta Rhei development videogame used an Oren-Nayar model for diffuse reflectance, Cook-Torrance model for specular highlights (replacing a Blinn–Phong shading model used in earlier demonstrations). Demonstrations used tile-based deferred rendering generally, with forward rendering also applied for simulations of translucent skin effects, and other transparent objects. Indirect lighting was demonstrated again, using a 128x128x128 voxel grid representing local light intensity, and voxel cone tracing along 12 directions (dodecahedral). Specific demonstrations at CEDEC were a pre-integrated skin shader for simulation of light through (human/animal) skin effects, and a 'liquid' shader; surface reflections were modelled using a screen space reflection technique originally developed by Crytek, utilising parallax- corrected environmental maps; a hair modelling effect using runtime compute shader generation of hair positions, in conjunction with tessellation.CEDEC session (www.4gamer.net) In November 2014 at AMD's \\"Future of Compute\\" Singapore conference Masaru Ijuin of Capcom announced that AMD's Mantle API technology was being incorporated into the game engine. As of 2019, no new updates of the engine were made, with Capcom still using MT Framework for eight generation consoles and RE Engine for Resident Evil 7: Biohazard and Devil May Cry 5.

He was also with Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex at the capture of Cadiz, 21 June 1596. Castle Caulfield ruins, County Tyrone In 1598 Caulfield accompanied the Earl of Essex to Ireland, in command of a troop of horse, and was for a time stationed at Newry. In 1601, under Lord Mountjoy, he took part in the recapture of Kinsale from the Spanish invaders. Mountjoy left Caulfield in charge of a bridge built by him over the River Blackwater, in command of 150 men, where the fort erected for its protection was called Charlemont. After the accession of James I of England, Caulfield was knighted. After the Flight of the Earls of 1607, he was appointed receiver of the rents of Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone until 1610. On the division of the estates, Caulfield received a grant of a thousand acres on which he built a now ruined house, Castle Caulfield. He had, in 1608, been appointed to the command of the upper part of Tyrone and of Armagh. On 17 April 1613 he was named a privy councillor, and the same year he was chosen knight of the shire for Armagh in the Irish Parliament. On 19 February 1615 he was made master of the ordnance and on 10 May of the same year one of the council for the province of Munster. Subsequently he was appointed a member of the commission for the parcelling out of escheated (confiscated) lands.

History Advanced School's first premises, previously home of Dr. Butler, some 30 years after the School had moved. From its inception, the University of Adelaide welcomed female students, although degrees were not available to females until 1880. At first, the only schools preparing girls to Matriculation level were small private colleges such as Miss Martin's School and Parliament considered that education of women should be on a more structured basis, and the \\"Education Act of 1875\\" provided for establishment of a government-funded Advanced School. The first appointments were for a headmistress and assistant head: Jane Stanes and Edith Cook (both transferred from the Grote Street Model School), followed by Rene-Armand Martin (French). Stanes resigned the following year, ostensibly due to ill-health, and Cook was promoted to head in 1882. A Government regulation, stipulating that the head must be aged 25, had to be waived for her to be appointed, as she was only 20. The Minister of Education (Thomas King) did not approve, but his successor (J. Langdon Parsons) pushed it through. The school, in the two-storey former residence of Dr. Lambert Butler, Franklin Street, was opened on 7 October 1879 with sixteen students passing the entrance examination. Additional appointments were made in 1880: Madeline Rees George (German), Ellen Thornber (assistant), Kate C. Brown (assistant). By September 1880 the number of students was 92. The following year, there were more applicants than places. By 1882, girls from the school were prominent in the Matriculation results: two of the top nine were from the Advanced School. In 1883, both recipients of the Sir Thomas Elder prize for physiology were students of the Advanced School. Many criticisms were leveled against the school: that it robbed educated widows of a source of income as tutors; that by conducting an entrance examination and by not conducting junior classes it had an unfair advantage over other schools; and that by offering French and German rather than the more difficult (and essential for University degrees) Latin and Greek, it was gaining an inflated reputation and at the same time robbing talented women of opportunities. In 1891 a new purpose-built building on Grote Street was completed. The move from Franklin Street enabled the number of students to be raised from 124 to 150. This building still stands today (2016).  Combining with Adelaide High School  A.S.G. merged with the (co- educational) Adelaide High School in 1907 under headmaster W. J. Adey, later Director of Education. It took over the three adjacent buildings in Grote street which were previously (from east to west): Advanced School for Girls, Teachers' Training College, and Grote Street Model School.

However, the National Research Council's \\"Decadal Survey\\" did not prioritize the moon Titan for exploration, and the development of the advanced Stirling radioisotope generator was suspended indefinitely.The ASRG Cancellation in Context Future Planetary Exploration See also *Nuclear power in space *Dragonfly (spacecraft) (NF4 finalist) References *AVIATR: An Airplane Mission for Titan, Universe Today, 2 January 2012 *Soaring on Titan: Drone designed to scout Saturn's moon, NBC News, 10 January 2012 External links *AVIATR proposal presentation Category:Missions to Saturn Category:Titan (moon) Category:Proposed space probes Category:Extraterrestrial aircraft Category:Advanced Stirling radioisotope generator Category:Unmanned aerial vehicles of the United States ","title":"AVIATR"},{"id":"40133969","text":"Borough Hall in northwest part of park The Bronx Municipal Building, later known as Bronx Borough Hall and eventually as Old Bronx Borough Hall (1897–1969), was the original administrative headquarters of the Bronx Borough President and other local civic leaders. It was located in the Tremont neighborhood of the Bronx, New York City. Considered an architectural accomplishment of its era, it was located atop the rocky plateau of the northwest section of present-day Tremont Park, which was originally an extension of Crotona Park, southeast of the intersection of East Tremont Avenue and Third Avenue. The elevation of the building allowed for exceptional views from distances at many angles, and it was the converging point for civic affairs. The New York City Subway's IRT Third Avenue Line, the first elevated railway line in the borough, strategically ran along the bustling neighborhoods and stopped in front of the building at the Tremont Avenue–177th Street station, where a hub of trolley lines met.  Construction  Designed by George B. Post (1837–1913), a prominent New York City architect of the period, the three-story building facing west was picturesque, stylized in a Renaissance decor, with pale yellow brick and brown terra-cotta trim contrast. Post's most famous accomplishments include the main building of the New York Stock Exchange at 8 Broad Street and the long-gone Western Union Building, which stood at Broadway and Dey Street in Manhattan. Russell Sturgis, writing in Architectural Record in 1896, lauded the design as a 'common sense building with pleasant architectural results.' In 1874, the western section of present- day Bronx was annexed to New York City as the Northern annex. By then the area had approximately 40,000 people. The region was growing rapidly as by 1890 the population grew to nearly 90,000. City officials saw the demand and necessity to create a location for civic use to cater to the region. In 1891, the first district-wide official was elected, a Commissioner of Street Improvements. His agency and others developed and so required office space. By 1895 the eastern section of the present-day Bronx was annexed to the city. These expansions, along with the influx of immigrants of the period, more than doubled the population of the city to approximately 200,000. In 1895, Commissioner Louis F. Haffen, serving since 1893, led a successful campaign for a new building. The Bronx Municipal Building was completed in 1897. In 1898 the building was renamed Bronx Borough Hall when the other three boroughs were finally annexed to New York City. Louis F. Haffen became the first Bronx Borough President and was inaugurated in a second-floor office in the same year.  Expansion and debate  Grand Staircase, seen from Third Avenue In 1899 a grand stairway was added down the steep slope to Third Avenue. It was perhaps designed by Post, or possibly by the chief engineer of the Bronx, Louis Risse, who had mapped the concept of the Grand Boulevard and Concourse in 1890. After World War I, Victory Park, a formal garden with paths radiating from a large circular fountain, was beautifully landscaped near Borough Hall to celebrate the Allied victory over Germany. In contrast to the building's architectural appeal, surroundings, and the efforts taken to construct it, civic leaders began to express misgivings with regard to its capacity and usage. In 1909 Louis Haffen, president of the borough since its formation, called the building he had previously championed \\"entirely inadequate\\" and \\"impossible to enlarge or adapt\\" to the needs of the new borough. By 1928 the fifth Borough President Henry Bruckner was advocating for a New Borough Hall. The Bronx Board of Trade was proposing to construct the new Bronx Borough Hall adjacent to the current on the site of Victory Garden. They considered this to be a solution to allow for the razing of the original Borough Hall which was seen as \\"a non-fireproof building entirely in-adequate and out-of-keeping with the size and importance of our Borough\\". Second structure By 1930, only thirty years after it joined the city, the Bronx population had grown to more than 1.25 million residents, an increase of over a million people. In response to this vast growth, amid the Great Depression, the City erected the Bronx County Courthouse (a.k.a. the Supreme Court building) between 1931 and 1934. This new building, on the Grand Concourse, replaced the smaller Bronx Borough Courthouse, constructed between 1905 and 1914. With space made available within the nine-story building, by 1934 most borough offices and government services from Borough Hall had relocated to the new edifice. By 1964 only the Marriage License Bureau remained in the former building where space was given to veterans and community programs. With the passage of years Bronx Borough Hall became referred to as Old Bronx Borough Hall, while the parkland area of Crotona Park where it stood was called Old Borough Hall Park. During the third quarter of the 20th century, the new Cross Bronx Expressway was constructed. Built between 1948 and 1972, it was laid out in stages. One of the stages constructed in 1960 between Boston Road and Webster Avenue included the passage through Crotona Park, through the existing 175th Street separation of the northern end park extension—where Borough Hall stood—from the larger park. The expressway widened the separation of this northern section from the main part of Crotona Park. Old Borough Hall Park was then redesigned to include a baseball field at the south west end, and other sports and recreation at the east end, partly to compensate for the lost parkland.  Landmark status and demolition  Reports began to surface in the city and throughout Bronx communities that a proposal was being made to demolish Old Bronx Borough Hall. The Parks Commissioner at the time, Newbold Morris, supported the idea of tearing down the building to create more park space, possibly to replenish what was lost during the construction of the Cross Bronx Expressway. In addition, the East Tremont Neighborhood Association was seeking to either convert the building for a recreation center or to replace it entirely with a new community center, to be built here rather than elsewhere in the park or nearby. Both Newbold Morris and the East Tremont Neighborhood Association claimed that the building was unsafe. Amid reports of impending demolition, members of the Bronx County Historical Society, including Theodore Kazimiroff, Lloyd Ultan, John McNamara, Roger Arcara and William Romkey — all Bronx residents — began, with the full support of then Bronx Borough President Joseph F. Periconi, efforts to save the structure. On September 21, 1965 the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission held a public hearing on the proposed designation of the Old Bronx Borough Hall. Eight witnesses, including the Borough Historian and representatives of the Bronx County Historical Society, testified in favor of designation of the building. A sole representative of the Parks Department opposed the designation. The East Tremont Neighborhood Association wrote the Commission pleading that Old Borough Hall be razed and the site be used for a new indoor recreation center. Community Planning Board 6 and three other local groups supported the view of the East Tremont Neighborhood Association. In a letter to the Commission, Bronx Borough President Periconi said that he would like \\"to reiterate my support of the designation of the Old Bronx Borough Hall as a historical landmark and urge your Commission to approve this designation.\\" With historical facts and testimony in hand the Landmarks Preservation Commission called the borough hall \\"a good example of public building through the nobility and scale of the architectural elements employed.\\" In October 1965 the Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the building its 23rd landmark in New York City. Old Bronx Borough Hall officially became the first Bronx landmark. The landmarks law gave the New York City Board of Estimate 90 days in which to veto or modify any designation. In December, Commissioner Newbold Morris again wrote the board, calling the building rundown, unsightly and of no architectural importance. Borough President Periconi had emphatically supported the designation through his tenure. In January 1966 he was succeeded by new Borough President Herman Badillo. On January 27, 1966—the last possible day of review—the Board of Estimate deferred to Badillo and his view, and voted to overturn the designation. In 1968 there was a major fire in the building, by then completely vacant. Continued efforts by the Bronx County Historical Society and others to renovate the hall for civic use were halted when the building was deemed structurally unsafe, and then demolished on January 12, 1969. Only the grand staircase survives, though in poor state. Despite all claims through the years that the building was a fire hazard, an article in 1969 by Professor Lloyd Ultan in the Bronx County Historical Society Journal, reveals that the interior of Old Bronx Borough Hall had both gas and electric lighting and fireproof document vaults on each floor. Despite demands from the East Tremont Neighborhood Association, Bronx Borough Hall was never replaced by a sports center nor was one built nearby.  Current plans  Over the years, the park has been renamed to Highland Park (1987) and more recently Tremont Park (1999). It has seen different renovations, but investments have yet to rehabilitate the stairway that now leads to an empty top and to commemorate an iconic chapter in Bronx and New York's preservation history. The Bronx currently does not have a proper stand-alone administration building for the Bronx Borough President's office and other civic agencies. These offices continue to operate out from the Bronx County Courthouse.

Overview  Composite image roughly comparing the sizes of Saturn and Earth To unveil the processes of outer planet formation and Solar System evolution, detailed studies of the composition, structure, and dynamics of giant planet interiors and atmospheres would be necessary. To constrain the internal structure of gas giants, a combination of both in-situ entry-probe missions and remote-sensing studies of the giant planets would be needed. The Saturn Atmospheric Entry Probe mission would consist of a carrier-relay spacecraft and a probe. The carrier-relay spacecraft would release the probe into Saturn, a gas giant, and provide data relay from the probe to Earth. The probe would determine the structure of the atmosphere as well as noble gas abundances and isotopic ratios of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. = Objectives = * determine the noble gas abundances and isotopic ratios of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and argon in Saturn's atmosphere. * determine the atmospheric structure at the probe descent location. Tier 2 objectives include:Scientific Value of a Saturn Atmospheric Probe Mission. (PDF) D. H. Atkinson. NASA, 2012. * determine the vertical profile of zonal winds as a function of depth at the probe entry location; * determine the location, density, and composition of clouds as a function of depth in the atmosphere; * determine variability of atmospheric structure and the presence of clouds at the location; * determine the vertical water abundance profile at the probe descent location; * make precision isotope measurements for light elements (e.g. S, N, O) in atmospheric constituents. Scientific payload In order to complete its objectives, the probe must carry at least these two instruments: * a mass spectrometer (MS); it would determine the noble gas abundances and isotopic ratios of H, C, N, O, and Ar in Saturn's atmosphere. * an atmospheric structure instrument (ASI); based on the Galileo probe design, it would consist of three sensors for measuring temperature, pressure, and density.  Timeline  = Launch and trajectory = Launch is proposed for 30 August 2027. After launch, the spacecraft would enter heliocentric orbit and be placed on a trajectory to fly by the Earth, which is proposed to take place on 16 July 2030 at a distance of 300 km. After that, the spacecraft would spend 4 years traveling to Saturn. = Approach and targeting phase = This phase would begin 8 months before arrival. The probe would separate from carrier–relay spacecraft and free-fall into Saturn's atmosphere. = Science phase = Hours before the probe's entry, the science phase would begin. An event timer on the probe would initiate activities, while the carrier–relay spacecraft would power up its radio receiver and turn to point its probe-relay antenna to the entry site. The probe would enter Saturn's atmosphere at velocity of approximately 27 km/s, which is less than the Galileo Probe's velocity of 47.4 km/s. After the entry heating and deceleration phase, the probe would deploy a drogue parachute and then the main parachute when it reached an atmospheric pressure of 0.1 bar. At 1 bar of pressure, the parachute would be released and the descent module would continue free-falling through the atmosphere (possibly with stabilization from another drogue parachute) to the nominal end of mission, 55 minutes after entry and 250 km deep. The probe would be designed to endure at least 10 bars of pressure. = Downlink of data, flyby of Saturn and end of mission = Shortly after data relay ends, downlink of data would begin. The data set measured by the probe would be about approximately 2 Mb, so 20 minutes would be need to complete the data downlink. The carrier–relay spacecraft would fly by Saturn at a distance of approximately 100 Mm and it would continue on a solar escape trajectory. Mission Proposal Following the concept study done to support the NASA Decadal Survey, the Saturn Atmospheric Entry probe concept was further developed into a mission concept, which was proposed under the name SPRITE (\\"Saturn PRobe Interior and aTmospheric Explorer\\") to the NASA New Frontiers program solicitation in 2016.

After retiring, O'Connor went into business and devoted himself to helping Nepalese Sherpas. O'Connor grew up in a large Catholic family in New York City and went to college at the University of Notre Dame. After starting for Notre Dame's football team as a freshman in 1944, he spent two years in the U.S. Navy during World War II and played for a service team at Naval Station Great Lakes that was coached by Paul Brown. O'Connor returned to Notre Dame in 1946 and graduated in 1947, but he did not play in his senior year because of a knee injury. O'Connor signed in 1948 with the Buffalo Bills of the AAFC, where he played for one year. He was then traded to the Cleveland Browns, another AAFC team coached by Brown. The Browns won the AAFC championship in 1949, but O'Connor was cut early the next year and played one season for the minor- league Jersey City Giants. He next had a one-year stint with the New York Yanks of the National Football League before his playing career in the CFL with the Toronto Argonauts. A late-game touchdown catch by O'Connor helped the Argonauts win the Grey Cup in 1952. O'Connor worked for Sears in Canada after his playing career, and served as the color commentator for Grey Cup broadcasts from 1956 to 1981. He became friends with the famed mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary and helped establish a foundation in his name to benefit Sherpas in Nepal. On September 24, 2015, O'Connor was the recipient of the Sandy Hawley Community Service Award, awarded by the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in Toronto, Ontario.http://oshof.ca/index.php/hawley-awards/2015-hawley- oconnor Early life and college O'Connor was born in New York City and grew up in the Bronx, one of the city's five boroughs. He was the son of a police officer and part of a large Catholic family. O'Connor attended Mount Saint Michael Academy, a Catholic school in the Bronx, where he played football and was voted the team's best end in 1942 and 1943. His large size – he was six feet, four inches tall – made him an attractive prospect for college football programs across the country, and he accepted a scholarship offer from Notre Dame. O'Connor was a starter for Notre Dame as a freshman left end in 1944. The team finished the season with an 8–2 win–loss record under coach Edward McKeever, but O'Connor joined a V-12 Navy College Training Program in the middle of the year as World War II raged on. O'Connor played for a U.S. Navy team in a game against Army held in London in late 1944. In 1945, he played for a service team at Naval Station Great Lakes outside of Chicago that was coached by Paul Brown. He caught a touchdown pass that December in a 39–7 win over Notre Dame. O'Connor returned to Notre Dame in 1946, but coach Frank Leahy demoted him to the second team midway through the season as punishment for leaving the school's South Bend, Indiana campus to see a girl. He suffered a knee injury in a practice before the start of the 1947 season that kept him on the bench all year. Notre Dame went undefeated in 1946 and 1947, and won the college football national championship both years by finishing first in the national polls. Professional career O'Connor was selected by the Buffalo Bills of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in the fourth round of the 1948 draft. The Green Bay Packers of the National Football League were also interested in signing him, but O'Connor chose to play for the Bills because several Notre Dame alumni – including quarterback George Ratterman – were on the team. He had 301 receiving yards and two touchdowns in 1948, when the Bills had a 7–7 record and won the AAFC's eastern division. The Bills lost the AAFC championship game to the Cleveland Browns. The Bills traded O'Connor in early 1949 to the Browns for tackle Bob McClelland. O'Connor played in nine games for the Browns, a team coached by Paul Brown, but did not have a reception. Cleveland won the AAFC championship that year, its fourth in a row. The Browns cut O'Connor before the beginning of the next season, and he played in 1950 for the Jersey City Giants, a minor-league team in the now-defunct American Association. O'Connor signed in 1951 to play for the New York Yanks, an NFL team. The Yanks finished with a 1–9–2 win–loss–tie record, putting them out of contention in the NFL's National Division. O'Connor earned a master's degree from Columbia University while playing in New York. In 1952, O'Connor began a two-year stint with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (CFL). In O'Connor's first season with the team, the Argonauts finished with a 7–4–1 record and went on to win the Grey Cup, the CFL's championship trophy. O'Connor caught a touchdown pass off of his fingertips late in the championship game from Nobby Wirkowski, sealing the 21–11 win over the Edmonton Eskimos. The play was one of the most celebrated of its era in the CFL and the Grey Cup, which was televised for the first time in 1952. O'Connor retired from football after the 1953 season, when the Argonauts finished with a 5–9 regular-season record. Later life O'Connor stayed in Canada after finishing his football career. He coached football in Toronto and took an entry-level job at Sears, a global department store chain. He also served as a color commentator for Grey Cup broadcasts from 1956 to 1981. He worked at Sears for 31 years, rising to vice president of public relations. As O'Connor climbed the corporate ladder at Sears, he became the head of marketing for sporting goods in Canada and handled the company's relationships with major sports figures. These included Ted Williams and Sir Edmund Hillary, who became the first man to summit Mount Everest in 1953. O'Connor and Hillary met while O'Connor was on a camping trip in Ottawa in 1973 and struck up a friendship. Later that year, Hillary invited O'Connor and several other Sears executives to visit Nepal and consider charitable contributions for the Sherpa people who helped him climb Everest. O'Connor suffered from altitude sickness on the trip, but agreed to establish the Sir Edmund Hillary Foundation of Canada when he returned to Toronto. O'Connor started the foundation and was its president for more than 30 years, helping build schools and hospitals in Nepal. He also introduced Nepal to the Special Olympics, an athletic competition for disabled adults. His daughter Karen took over the foundation in 2008. O'Connor published a memoir in 2012 called Journey with the Sherpas: The Story of Zeke O'Connor and the Sir Edmund Hillary Foundation. He lives in Toronto and still visits the Sherpas annually. He has three children.

He and Lex were attacked by indirect fire at Company A's forward operating base on March 21, 2007. A 73 mm rocket round exploding inside the base delivered a mortal wound to Lee, which also injured Lex. Early life Dustin Lee, son of Mississippi Highway Patrol trooper Jerome Lee, was born on April 7, 1986, in Meridian, Mississippi. From around five years old, Lee worked with rescue dogs by hiding in woods and allowing them to find him. According to his father, he was so moved by the September 11 attacks that he signed up for the military before graduating high school. Lee grew up in Quitman, Mississippi and graduated from Quitman High School in 2004. Military career and death Lee finished first in his training class as a dog handler in 2005. He was noted by the kennel master, William W. Reynolds, to be \\"uncanny as a dog handler\\". Because of his abilities, Lee was once given two dogs to work with at once: an explosives dog and a narcotics dog. He was stationed at Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany, HQ BN in Albany, Georgia before his deployment to Iraq. Lee was promoted to the rank of Corporal in July 2006. He attached to 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion before the attack, and was serving in 3rd Battalion 14th Marines G Battery, 3rd platoon at the time of his death. On March 21, 2007, Company A’s forward operating base was attacked by insurgents with indirect fire. Lee and Lex sustained shrapnel injuries when a 73 mm rocket exploded inside Lee's forward operating base. Cpl. Lee was medevaced from the area to a hospital, where he died shortly thereafter; Lex's injuries were not life-threatening. Lee was scheduled to return home in approximately six weeks. Aftermath Dustin Lee was interred at Stonewall Cemetery in Stonewall, Mississippi on March 31, 2007. He was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart, Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with Combat Distinguishing Device for Valor and the Combat Action Ribbon. Lee's parents, aided by United States Representative Walter Jones (R-NC) and an online petition, successfully asked the Marine Corps to allow Lex to retire early, making him the first fully fit military working dog granted early retirement and adoption by the Department of Defense to his former handler’s family. After Lee's death, the Mississippi State Senate and House of Representatives passed a concurrent resolution honoring him. On March 19, 2010, Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany renamed its kennel the \\"Corporal Dustin Jerome Lee Kennel\\". Lex died on March 25, 2012 as the result of cancer.

It consists of a rectangular escutcheon (shield), featuring a part of the northern walls of Diocletian's Palace, as they appeared in the Medieval period. In the middle, above the walls, is the belfry of the Cathedral of Saint Domnius. In the upper corners are two shields, to the left (dexter) the historical coat of arms of Croatia, and right (sinister) a shield picturing the town's patron, Saint Domnius. The coat of arms is bordered with Gothic rectangles, which represent the walls of the Palace. History The arms on the wall of the Old City Hall in Split. The oldest confirmation of Split using the basic design of the rectangular coat of arms, featuring the north walls of the Palace, dates to the early 14th century. Stone cuttings are preserved from the 14th and 15th centuries featuring the same arms with the shields about the belfry. At any one time these shields represented the rulers to whom Split owed its allegiance. Later on, the coat of arms was also found without the shields by the belfry, and sometimes using different shapes other than rectangular. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the arms sometimes used a classical heraldic shield, as a rule without the shields around the belfry. After World War II, no coat of arms was used until 1969, when the Medieval arms were restored in their old rectangular shape, and once again with shields on the sides of the belfry: this time a red Croatian chequy representing Croatia, and a red star shield representing Yugoslavia. Besides the new shields, the 1969 version also introduced the current colour scheme, i.e. the use of blue for the Palace outline and the border, on a white background, with red shields around the belfry (red, white, and blue being Croatian colours). The 1969 design essentially persists to this day, with the Yugoslav red star being replaced in 1991 (after the Breakup of Yugoslavia), with a white image of Saint Domnius on a blue background. Modern variants The arms used by the Split Hospital differ primarily in that the shield featuring a white Saint Domnius has a red background. The city municipal transport company, Promet Split, uses a variant with a bus pictured exiting from the gates of the Palace.

The presence of science and technology in Spain dates back to Spain's prehistoric period. It is taken to include firstly an account of the historical development of these fields of study, and secondly a description of the current institutional and regulatory framework for continuing this development into the future. History The scope of Spain's history with science and technology generally overlaps with the history of science and the history of technology of human history, particularly in Europe.José Manuel Sánchez Ron: Cincel, martillo y piedra.

Manuel Desantes ¿Cómo que inventen ellos?. Conferencia: Un repaso de los últimos quinientos años de la historia de la ciencia y la tecnología en España explica el retraso estructural actual. El II Congreso de la sociedad española de historia de las ciencias (Jaca, 27 de septiembre–1 de octubre, 1982) fue dedicado a La ciencia y la técnica en España entre 1850 y 1936, teniendo entre otras, ponencias con estos títulos: Antonio Ferraz Perspectivas institucionales de la historia de la ciencia y de la técnica en España; Eduardo Ortiz Sobre la ciencia y la técnica en España en el siglo XIX; José Luis Peset La historia de la ciencia y de la técnica en el curriculum profesional del científico y del ingeniero. Classifying the degree of scientific, technical or technological notability of certain movements or inventions are established by the established discipline of studies in Science, Technology and Society (STS). Whilst scientific and technical activities are as old as the human race, instances of integrating systematic knowledge, material resources, skills and technical procedures to transform a production process through the application of a defined methodology surfaced at the start the late modern period; in the case of Spain, this came tragically late, in contrast to the verve with which she had become one of the first to enter the early modern period. Very few Spanish scientists (excepting those such as Servet or Cajal) were instrumental in the paradigm shifts characteristic of successive scientific revolutions. As a consequence, in Spain the study of the history of science concerns itself mainly with the effects these paradigms had on reaching Spain, and the same is true of technology transfers. Science and technology in Spain was such a \\"marginal feature of its administrative and social structures\\",Thomas F. Glick, Eugenio Portela Marco, Víctor Navarro Brotóns: La historia de la ciencia en España como realidad marginal en su organización y contexto social, Anthropos, 1982, Número 20, especial dedicado a José María López Piñero. ficha en dialnet that this very marginality came to be used as a sort of Spanish national stereotype, sometimes rejected as being pejorative or belittling but on occasion seized on with haughty pride, as in Miguel de Unamuno's immortal phrase, repeatedly used and abused ever since, on both sides of the argument, to the extent of becoming a literary motif or cliché: This use of the masculine \\"ellos\\" reflects the discrepancy of women in Spanish science. A converse statement, ¡Que inventen ellas! (\\"Let women invent!\\") is also used.Logros científicos de mujeres en la muestra '¡Que inventen ellas!', El País, 12/09/2003 Throughout history science and technology were almost entirely male preserves, until the late decades of the 20th century saw the balance shift in quantitative terms. Nevertheless, gender studies and women's history, when dealing with the history of science and technology, have focussed on achieving recognition for significant female contributors in these fields. =Prehistory= Given the absence of written sources, the reconstruction of aspects of pre-scientific and pre-technological thought has been attempted through analysis and interpretation of paleolithic art – of which the Iberian peninsula possesses examples of exceptional value; through studies of stone-working techniques; and through anatomical reconstructions. James Frazer in The Golden Bough proposed similarities between the function of science and that of magic in primitive cultures and in the \\"primitive mind\\".Summary in John Lewis (1985), Antropología simplificada, Selector, , pp. 80–81 More recently André Leroi-Gourhan studied the topic from a structuralist perspective. The identification of \\"phases\\" through which human thought has passed in interpreting nature originate with the positivism of Auguste Comte – theological or fictive state; metaphysical or abstract state; and scientific or positivist state. Many other terms have been proposed: magical thinking, pre-philosophical thought, mythopoeic thoughtHenri Frankfort, Wilson and Jacobsen: The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man, 1946, later titled Before Philosophy, translated into Spanish as El Pensamiento Prefilosófico, FCE and others. The pre-neanderthal (Homo Heidelbergensis) finds at the Atapuerca site near Burgos in Spain offer one of the most promising directions for paleoanthropological research: to establish the degree of oral communication in that species by reconstruction of the sound-producing mechanism (hyoid) and hearing apparatus (bone structure and inner-ear cavity). This could be linked with other findings from the site, such as the deliberate accumulation of corpses. All this would necessitate consideration of the capacity for symbolic thought.Ignacio Martínez, Human Evolution conference, CTIF, Alcalá de Henares 29 April 2009Juan Luis Arsuaga, El collar del neandertal (En: The Neanderthal’s Necklace), El enigma de la esfinge (En: The Riddle of the Sphinx) and other works. The theory of the \\"Neolithic revolution\\" implies a diffusionist interpretation of the spread of innovations such as agriculture and pottery.José María Rodanés Vicente (2007) Neolithic, Cæsaraugusta, 78. pp. 49–66, , especially p. 52 et seq. On the other hand, it is argued that copper working at Los Millares (near Almería in Spain) during the chalcolithic period (beginning of the third millennium BC) could have arisen independently, together with an increase in agricultural yields due to irrigation as seen at the Cerro de la Virgen de Orce site, as well as walled settlements and social stratification.El calcolítico en la Península Ibérica (España) (The Chalcolithic period in Iberia) in Artehistoria. During the first civilisations in the Middle East, the part played by the “Far Western” regions in long- distance metal trading was vital for the development there of Bronze Age metallurgical techniques. Next, around 1000BC, Iron Age metallurgy was introduced simultaneously but independently to Iberia by Mediterranean colonisers (Greek and Phoenician) on the southern and eastern coasts, and by Celts from Central Europe in the centre, west and north. Less is known of the introduction of other technologies such as the wheel, the plough and the sail. =The Roman period= Esparto grass artefacts from the Roman mine workings at Carthago Nova (Cartagena). Museo Arqueológico Municipal de Cartagena. Romanisation proliferated throughout Hispania, as shown in the construction techniques that gave rise to such completed structures as the Alcántara bridge or the Aqueduct of Segovia; a complex network of roads; the first dams for water storage (although whether these are in fact Roman is still under debate);Mérida. Una investigación de cinco años sobre la presa de Proserpina descarta su origen romano : Terrae Antiquae, 26 de abril de 2006 (quotes a range of sources) or different types of mining ranging from large-scale gold mines such as that at las Médulas to the extraction of lapis specularis. Some of the most important scientists of the Hellenistic period came to Cádiz, such as Polybius, Artemidorus and Posidonius, who took the chance while there to make measurements of the tides (more visible in the Atlantic than in the Mediterranean) and suggest their causes.José María Blázquez, Corpus de mosaicos de España, CSIC, 1982, , p. 49. Among the few Hispano-Latin writers on scientific topics were Pomponius Mela from Algeciras, and Columella from Cádiz, both from the Baetica province. The former wrote De Chorographia, a work of geography, and the latter wrote Res rustica and Liber de arboribus, on agronomy. The following quotation from Columela shows clearly how the speculative nature of Greco-Roman scientific activity was disconnected from technology and manual work, reflecting the basic separation between the “otium” (leisure time) fitting for philosophers, and the world of “negotium” (commerce) and slavery. =Medieval science= Astrolabe of al-Sahlî, constructed in Toledo in 1067. Museo Arqueológico Nacional. Atlas catalán de Cresques Abraham, 1375. It was in the Iberian peninsula that medieval science saw some of its greatest developments. These were achieved under both Christian and Muslim rule, with an important Jewish contribution. Already during the \\"Dark Ages\\", some of the few scholars were located within the Visigothic kingdom of Toledo and Hispanic monasticism: in particular San Isidoro with his Etymologiae. The transition from feudalism to capitalism implied technological changes driven forward or hindered by the different socio-economic structures, which in Spain were made manifest in the different forms of innovation in agriculture, livestock farming, food production and other crafts. In some cases these were promoted by institutions – monasteries or craft guilds; in other cases they arose from within the productive activities themselves, which to a greater or less extent kept their “trade secrets” and in the stratified society of the time were deprecated as “vile and mechanical trades”.Díez, Fernando (1990) Viles y mecánicos. Trabajo y sociedad en la Valencia preindustrial (Vile and mechanical: work and society in pre-industrial Valencia).

El caso de la seda murciana (Child and youth labour in the Baroque period: the example of the silk industry in Murcia) The most spectacular examples of the technology of this period are the water wheels of South-eastern Spain, together with other irrigation techniques introduced or perfected by the Arab-Hispanic civilisation. The incorporation of the later medieval kingdoms of Spain into European trade routes between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean stimulated not only seafaring technology and the associated map-making and astronomical studies, but also the introduction of new commercial and financial institutions. Examples from the Kingdom of Aragón include trading halls (:es:Lonja de la Seda), money-changing tables (:es:Taula de canvi), and codes of law governing maritime trade (:es:Consulado del mar); and from the Kingdom of Castile, trade fairs such as those of Medina del Campo, Medina de Rioseco and Villalón, where the first bills of exchange were drawn up.Fundación Museo de las Ferias. Documents from the fairs of Medina del Campo, Villalón and Medina de Rioseco, 2002 =Early modern science= Armillary sphere, Library of El Escorial, 1582. Marine chronometer, J. R. Losada, 1850–1860. The effects of the conquest of the Americas on Spain – in particular the negative effects of inflation, reduction in incentives for productive investment, and social and ideological conservatism – that led to the growth of Spanish economic science. One of its fundamental texts, by Tomás de Mercado, is titled Suma de tratos y contratos (On deals and contracts) (1571), paraphrasing the title of St Thomas Aquinas’ work Summa theologica. These trade practices were linked to the Jewish and converted Christian minorities. Lending at interest was considered as the sin of usury, both in Christian and Islamic morality. This lay at the root of some of the issues that determined the course of cultural and intellectual history, such as the dialectic between New and Old Christians, and the shaping of the financial and tax-collecting systems of the nascent authoritarian monarchy after its unification by the Catholic Monarchs. The “most religious” policy of this monarchy also justified a whole series of decisions with important consequences for production, science and technology in Spain. Among these were the expulsion of the Jews in 1492; the expulsion of the Moriscos (Christian converts from Islam, and their descendants) in 1609; the persecution of dissidents of all types – alumbrados, Protestants, followers of Erasmus; in addition to the subjection of conscience to the Inquisition, which universalised suspicion, denunciation and self-censorship. The economic importance of the Spanish treasure fleet and the exploitation of minerals from the New World called for science and technology of the highest level, above all in the maritime and metallurgical fields. The clear priority for any conceivable “scientific programme” would have been to address the needs of the immense overseas empire. A notable example of Spanish scientific aspirations at the time was in 1598, when Felipe III launched an open competition for a method of determining longitude at sea. In 1616 Galileo Galilei himself made an attempt at the attractive prize (with a method based on observing the movements of the moons of Jupiter).Daniel Mediavilla, El GPS de las estrellas (The GPS of the stars), Publico.es, 19 August 2008 The ambition of this competition became evident from the fact that its goal did not prove achievable until the development of watches in the 18th century, when naval primacy was passing to England. From 1731 watches were available in England, such as that devised by John Harrison which relied on springs only, not pendulums or weights, and was kept in a box mounted in gimbals to absorb the movement of the ship. Meanwhile, Spanish watchmaking technology had fallen behind: despite royal sponsorship (:es:Real Escuela de Relojería (1770), :es:Real Fábrica de Relojes (1788–93)), the royal collections of Carlos III and Carlos IV turned to the products of John Ellicott or of French watchmakers. This remained the case until the mid-19th century with the notable works of :es:José Rodríguez Losada.Catalogue of the Spanish Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales, p. 68.Roberto Moreno José Rodríguez de Losada. Vida y obra (Life and Work). 1995, Madrid: Fundación Juanelo Turriano. In another field, but no less indicative of the future, was the chess contest staged by Felipe II in his court in 1575. On that occasion the Spanish master Ruy López de Segura, up to then considered the best practical and theoretical exponent of chess, was dethroned by the Italian Leonardo da Cutri. While the medieval university renewed itself under the influence of humanism, the Counter-Reformation led to an isolation from outside influences and a general stagnation of the institution, which came to fulfil what had always been its main function: the reproduction of the élites (see :es:Colegio Mayor). Nevertheless, we should not exaggerate some aspects of this closure to the exterior. Take for instance the infamous decree of 1559 forbidding Castilian students from attending universities outside the kingdom (in 1568 extended to students from Aragón); in practice this was applied with little rigour and its motivation is debated – it may have been not so much a defence against Protestantism as an attack on the Jesuits and on the University of Louvain, which was not excepted as were those of Bologna, Rome, Naples and Coimbra. =The Enlightenment= Map of Isla de San Carlos (Easter Island) compiled by the expedition of Felipe González Ahedo (1772). Museo Naval de Madrid. Throughout the Age of Enlightenment, the awareness of the poor state of science and technology in Spain arose out of the “negative introspection” of the arbitristas of the 17th and especially the 18th century. In the “light of reason” these sought progress in applied science. Following the debate generated by Masson de Morvilliers’ provocative question “What do we owe to Spain?” it became a commonplace that unlike literature and the arts, science in Spain considerably lagged behind that in other European countries. Indeed, this became such a prevalent cliché as to provoke a “complaint about the complaint” among writers such as Cadalso or Larra (Cartas marruecas, En este país). In reality the field of “science” was not clearly distinguished from that of “letters” or “the humanities” until the Enlightenment; and even much later the width of the breach between the two fields of knowledge was not recognised, as witness the Two Cultures debate of the mid-20th century. It is in this context that we should view the famous speech of Don Quixote on “weapons and letters”:Miguel de Cervantes, Don Quixote, ch.38, The Literature Network while in the Middle Ages the knight may have distinguished himself mainly by his military adventures, from the Renaissance onward it became clear that high rank did not have to conflict with intellectual development. \\"Letters\\" at this period embraced theology as well as humanities,Valentín Moreno Gallego (2005), Letras misivas, letras humanas, letras divinas. La correspondencia del cardenal Granvela en la Real Biblioteca y sus cartas de autores (Correspondence of Cardinal Granvela). Cuadernos de Historia Moderna (Journal of Modern History), 2005 Annex 4, , pp. 31–55. which had recently emerged as independent disciplines: grammar, law, and what were called \\"liberal arts\\" including medicine (then known as \\"physic\\" and practised by \\"physicians\\"), the different branches of mathematics – among which astronomy was not yet distinguished from astrology -, and philosophy – not then distinct from what we would now term as \\"science\\", especially in the adjectival forms \\"natural philosophy\\" and \\"natural history\\"Filosofía e historia natural en la Ilustración (Philosophy and natural history in the Enlightenment), University of Valladolid Luis Millones Figueroa (2006), Filosofía e historia natural en el Inca Garcilaso (Philosophy and natural history in Inca Garcilaso), in Ensayos de cultura virreinal latinoamericana (Essays on Latin American culture under the viceroys), Lima: University of San Marcos. (both these terms later became obsolete in Spanish use). Regardless of the adverse circumstances prevailing in the late 18th and early 19th centuries (:es: crisis del Antiguo Régimen), the key to what was more and more coming to be perceived as “Spanish backwardness” was the survival of certain pre-industrial socio-economic structures, at the decisive moment when the Industrial Revolution began in England and the French Revolution occurred in France. This is also the crucial context in which, in the most advanced countries, science and technical progress began to be coordinated – up to then they had remained largely separate spheres. In time such coordination led to the emergence of \\"technology\\" in a full sense, and initiated feedback processes arising from the social need for innovation. Resistance to modernisation in Spain was expressed in the strong antagonism between the Francophiles and their opponents the :es:’’casticistas’’, who accused the Francophiles of all sorts of religious heterodoxy – Jansenism, Freemasonry, pantheism, freethinking, Voltairianism, agnosticism, atheism – as exemplified in the trial of Pablo de Olavide. Paradoxically, those among the clergy who became victims of persecution were the most scientifically educated group: the Jesuits,Francesc Gómez Morales (2006), Cómo los jesuitas inundaron Europa de científicos (How the Jesuits flooded Europe with scientists). Forum Libertas who were expelled from Spain in 1767, having been blamed for the Esquilache Riots. Their schools and libraries were closed down and their members dispersed, although many of them based themselves in Rome and continued to publish scientific and literary works in Spanish. The PiaristsVicente Faubell Zapata (2008), Historia de la acción educativa de los Escolapios en España de 1733 a 1845 (History of educational activities of the Piarists in Spain, 1733-1845), Universia became the order most engaged with teaching outside the university, although at a much more elementary level – the Jesuits focussed on the social and intellectual élite. The Society of Jesus was re-introduced to Spain during the 19th century, was again suppressed during the Second Republic and was restored under Franco. However, suspicion of science was not confined to Spain: in England and Holland at the end of the 17th and start of the 18th centuries there was strong medical opposition to the use of cinchona (\\"Jesuit powder\\").Malaria. Exhibition in the National Library, 2009. La Condesa, los Jesuitas, el Cardenal, el Demonio, Linneo y sus Polvos (The Countess, the Jesuits, the Cardinal, the Devil, Linnaeus and his Powders) =19th century= The Peninsular War, better known in Spain as the War for Spanish Independence, was truly a disaster for Spanish science and technology, which in some fields had achieved a leading position. Spanish science had contributed to the discovery of two – platinum and tungsten – of the 21 chemical elements identified in the 18th centuryJosé Manuel Sánchez Ron (2009), ¡Viva la ciencia!, pp. 93–94. Barcelona: Crítica, . and then to that of vanadium in 1801; but played no part in the discovery of another 50 elements during the rest of the 19th century. Of greater importance even than the systematic destruction of infrastructure by both French and British armies, such as the textile industry of BéjarJosé Luis Comellas (1988), Historia de España Contemporánea, p. 83. Ediciones Rialp, . or the porcelain manufacture of Buen Retiro in Madrid, was the \\"brain drain\\" resulting from the exiling in turn of Francophiles and Liberals. The closure of universities – whose reform, aimed at by proponents of the Enlightenment, had proved just as impossible as any other reform that threatened to disturb the structural underpinnings of the ancien régime – was offset only by the opening in 1830 of a bullfighting school in Seville headed by Pedro Romero.Mariano José de Larra (1836), De 1830 à 1836, ó, La España desde Fernando VII hasta Mendizabal: resumen histórico critico, p.13. Imprenta RepullésMariano José de Larra, Artículos Varios, p. 124. Editorial Castalia, 1976 . At any rate, the gathering together of funds scattered during the sackings allowed the opening of the Prado Museum in Madrid, in the building originally intended as the base for the Royal Office for Science, the National Library, and other academic institutions. \\\\ Gradually, the university sector was renewed: one major act was the move of the former University of Alcalá to Madrid as the Universidad Central. Primary and secondary education were developed as the foundation of a far-reaching educational programme (:es:Ley Moyano), which however was not implemented effectively or widely until the Second Republic of 1931–36.Museo Pedagógico de Huesca website: standing exhibition on education. Rio Tinto mines, 1873. The economy of the 19th-century \\"liberal revolution\\" was hampered by the Carlist Wars and by the confiscation of church property. These factors severely held back an insecure process of industrialisation that had begun much earlier, as with textiles in Barcelona, or steel making in Málaga. The liberal programmes, especially those of the progresistas (in power 1854–56 and 1868–74), but also to a lesser extent of the moderados, included the promotion of railway-building and mining, opening Spain to foreign investment from France, Belgium and Britain. However, the protectionism of the end of the century meant closure of the economy to the outside world. Economic thinking during these periods reflected opposing demands: those of agrarian interests (the landowning oligarchy of Castile and Andalusia) and those of industrial interests (the bourgeoisie of the Catalan textile trade).Ángel Bahamonde, Política económica y liberalización, in Artehistoria. Awareness of having fallen behind was growing all the time, especially in the liberal élites, among whom were spreading strongly expressed slogans deriving from the Black Legend of the Spanish Inquisition. Such views were condemned in their turn as anti-Spanish propaganda, drawing on the studies of Julián Juderías. His 1914 work \\"The 'black legend' and historical truth\\"Julián Juderías (1914), La leyenda negra y la verdad histórica: contribución al estudio del concepto de España en Europa, de las causas de este concepto y de la tolerancia política y religiosa en los países civilizados. Madrid, Tip. de la Revista de Archivos. claimed that a wide range of Spanish scientists had been active during the Spanish Golden Age. His list can be found in a footnote to the Spanish Wikipedia article. The \\"polemic of Spanish science\\", in which the reactionary thought of Menéndez and others was opposed by the \\"krausista\\" followers of the German philosopher Krause, developed following the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in 1875. Later, as reaction to the disaster of the Spanish–American War of 1898, a \\"regenerationist\\" movement arose. =20th century= Purkinje cells in the cerebellum of a pigeon. Drawing by Ramón y Cajal, 1899. The award of the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1906 to the Spanish scientist Santiago Ramón y Cajal, at a time when Spanish science had in general little to be proud of, ushered in what became known as a ”Silver Age” of Spanish letters and sciences during the first third of the twentieth century. The Spanish Civil War was another tragedy for Spanish science, bringing about the exile of a whole generation of scientists – the next Spaniard to win the Nobel Prize for medicine, Severo Ochoa in 1959,Official webpage of the Nobel Prize committee, stating that \\"Titles, data and places given above refer to the time of the award\\". had taken American citizenship – and the moribund intellectual life in \\"internal exile\\" of many other scientists during the long poverty- stricken postwar period depicted in Luis Martín-Santos’ novel Tiempo de Silencio. It was indicative of the National Catholicism of the time that one of the biggest scholarly projects was the Library of Christian Authors (1944). However, despite censorship, over time the publishing trade diversified and showed a great capacity for innovation, both technically and of content. CSIC, 2007 The policy of autarky, and the concentration of capital in large banking and industrial corporations, gave some opportunity for scientific and technological development in strategic sectors such as shipbuilding, petrochemicals and hydroelectricity. Later, in 1968, the first nuclear power station was built. Scientific work was centred in the universities – their leading departments deprived of the majority of their pre-war teachers and subject to the \\"brain drain\\" of the young – and in the Spanish National Research Council (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, CSIC) which in 1939 had purged and taken over from a former research council of the krausista tradition.

The official declaration coincided with the 25th anniversary of the end of the Civil War were held up as glories of Francoist Spain, regardless of their importance – e.g., the heart transplant attempted by the Marquis of Villaverde, son-in-law to Franco himself, in September 1968, when the patient died the next day.La Gaceta, Report of the 40th anniversary of the 1968 heart transplant, 17 September 2008 The development drive that got under way in the 1960s speeded up as regards scientific and technical achievement during the final quarter of the century, with the Spanish transition to democracy and the entry into the European Union.

When the figures for scientific and technological production are adjusted to reflect levels of investment in R&D;, the performance of Spain's science and technology sector compares favourably with those of Germany, France and the USA.

Although Spain still has great potential for improvement in science and innovation, lack of finance continues to be the main limiting factor, Following much change in recent years, no fewer than three ministries (Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport, Ministry for Economic Affairs and Competition -which includes the office of the Secretary of State for Research, Development and Innovation, formerly a full ministry as the Ministry of Science and Innovation- and the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism) currently share responsibility for this sector under the provisions of Law 14/2011, passed on 1 June concerning Science, Technology and Innovation.BOE There is a State Plan for Scientific and Technical Investigation and for Innovation,Plan Estatal de Investigación Científica y Técnica y de Innovación 2013-2016 and a network of public research bodies (Organismos Públicos de Investigación, OPI), headed by the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), with Major Science Facilities (Grandes Instalaciones Científicas, GIC), Medium Sized Facilities (Instalaciones de Tamaño Medio, ITM) and science and technology parks (Asociación de Parques Científicos y Tecnológicos de España, APTE).

Their music has been described as a blend of \\"chamber classical and rock\\", \\"Chamber Music Rock\\", and \\"Belgian chamber rock\\" with elements of East and Southern European folk music. Aranis have recorded six albums, and have performed live at a number of European venues, including the Rock in Opposition festivals in Carmaux, France. They made their American concert debut at NEARfest Apocalypse at Zoellner Arts Center, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in June 2012. A biography of the group at All About Jazz said that \\"[i]n concert, Aranis creates an unforgettable atmosphere. Variation and expressivity hold the audience riveted. Chaotic structures and virtuoso crescendos alternate with serene intervals.\\" Biography Aranis are based in Antwerp, Belgium, and their music, composed by Vanvinckenroye, features contrabass, violin, accordion, flute, piano and guitar. Their first live performance was in Heist-op-den-Berg in 2002, and their debut album, Aranis was released in 2005. Aranis' third album, Songs From Mirage was released in 2009 and their sound was augmented by the inclusion of three female vocalists. Also in 2009, Vanvinckenroye created a solo bass project called BASta! and recorded Cycles, an album featuring him on solo multi-tracked double bass. Aranis released RoqueForte in 2010 and included drummer Dave Kerman of the 5uu's and Thinking Plague, departing from their hitherto \\"signature drummerless acoustic sound\\". In 2011 Aranis joined forces with Belgian groups Univers Zero and Present to form a 17-member ensemble called Once Upon a Time in Belgium. They premiered at the fourth edition of the Rock in Opposition festival held in Carmaux, France in September 2011, where they performed \\"New York Transformations\\", a work composed by Kurt Budé of Univers Zero. Once Upon a Time in Belgium appears in the documentary film Romantic Warriors II: A Progressive Music Saga About Rock in Opposition (2012); Aranis also features in this film, and the companion Romantic Warriors II: Special Features DVD (2013). In 2012, as a sextet and without a drummer again, Aranis departed from recording compositions by Vanvinckenroye and released Made in Belgium, an album of interpretations of works by other Belgian composers, including Wim Mertens, Daniel Denis of Univers Zero, and Roger Trigaux of Present. In 2014 Aranis released Made in Belgium II, another album of interpretations of works by Belgian composers, including Peter Vermeersch and Walter Hus.

These ethnic groups typically include the Lao, the Tai Lue, and the Tai Yuan etc. The suea pat is a long-sleeved shirt with no buttons. It is worn by wrapping the right side of the front panel of the shirt over the left side of the front panel, and the two panels are tied together via strings. Suea pats from Luang Prabang, Laos typically have large golden collars. Etymology The words \\"suea pat\\" and \\"suea pai\\" are made up of words of Tai origin. \\"Suea pat\\" and \\"suea pai\\" literally mean \\"wrapping shirt\\"; suea (, ) means \\"shirt\\", while pat (, ) and pai (, ) mean \\"to wrap sideways, to smear.\\" In Laos In present-day Laos, women wear suea pats to ceremonial events such as weddings.ການນຸ່ງຖືຂອງແມ່ຍິງລາວກັບງານປະເພນີ Each year in Luang Prabang, the winner of the Miss Songkran contest who becomes the next Miss Songkran, or nang sangkhane ( ), gets to wear a suea pat underneath a pha biang which is a scarf-like cloth that wraps diagonally from the lower right waist to the upper left shoulder. Design Diagram of suea pat Suea pat is traditionally made with indigo-dyed cotton, silk or velvet. There are different variations of the suea pat among various Tai-speaking people. Basic components of the suea pat include a collar, front panels, back panels, sleeves, and tie strings. There are tassels at the side of the garment, though not always present. Modern versions typically of Lao design may use fasteners or buttons in lieu of strings. The collar can be done with intricate goldwork or be left plain. A cuff matching the collar is sometimes present and the sleeves can be full or three-quarters length. The cross-collar design is likely an influence of Chinese fashion as late as the Ming Dynasty.

Established in 1980, the BJP's platform is generally considered as the right-wing of the political spectrum. , 43 BJP leaders have held the position of a chief minister, out of which twelve are incumbent. A chief minister is the head of government of each of the twenty-eight states and three union territories (UTs) (Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir and Puducherry). According to the Constitution of India, at the state- level, the governor is de jure head, but de facto executive authority rests with the chief minister. Following elections to the state legislative assembly, the governor usually invites the party (or coalition) with a majority of seats to form the government. The governor appoints the chief minister, whose council of ministers are collectively responsible to the assembly. Given he/she has the assembly's confidence, the chief minister's term is usually for a maximum of five years; there are no limits to the number of terms he/she can serve. Of the 43 BJP chief ministers, twelve are incumbent — Pema Khandu in Arunachal Pradesh, Sarbananda Sonowal in Assam, Pramod Sawant in Goa, Vijay Rupani in Gujarat, Manohar Lal Khattar in Haryana, Jai Ram Thakur in Himachal Pradesh, B. S. Yediyurappa in Karnataka, Shivraj Singh Chouhan in Madhya Pradesh, N. Biren Singh in Manipur, Biplab Kumar Deb in Tripura, Trivendra Singh Rawat in Uttarakhand, and Yogi Adityanath in Uttar Pradesh. Four of the BJP chief ministers have been women — Sushma Swaraj in Delhi, Uma Bharti in Madhya Pradesh, Anandiben Patel in Gujarat and Vasundhara Raje in Rajasthan. Raman Singh, who was chief minister of Chhattisgarh for 15 years and 9 days between December 2003 and December 2018 has been the longest- serving chief minister from the BJP. Devendra Fadnavis's second tenure as the chief minister of Maharashtra lasted for only three days, which is the least tenure among chief ministers from BJP; however, taking the total of all the tenures into consideration, Sushma Swaraj served as a chief minister of Delhi for the shortest period of 52 days. Bhairon Singh Shekhawat of Rajasthan was the first chief minister from the BJP; however some BJP leaders had already been elected before as the chief minister while being a member of the Janata Party (JP), an amalgam of political parties which included BJP's predecessor Bharatiya Jana Sangh. There have been five chief ministers from the BJP in Gujarat and Uttarakhand each, four chief ministers in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh each, and three in Delhi, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Karnataka each.

Music history Born in New York City to an immigrant family, Saks began music lessons at the age of five, first on the piano and then, at age nine, on the cello. She studied at New York's High School of Performing Arts and later at the Juilliard School with Leonard Rose. She gave prize- winning performances at the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow and the Casals Competition in Israel. In 1964, she won a Young Concert Artists's award. In 1971, she joined the New York Philharmonic, one of the first women to do so. However, over the years, Saks grew to dislike playing in an orchestra and, in 1976, accepted a faculty position in the University of Washington's music department, where she replaced the retiring Eva Heinitz. Seattle Chamber Music Society In 1982, Saks averred that she missed performing publicly but at the same time observed that Seattle lacked a major outlet for the expression of \\"classical\\" music. Saks decided to correct that shortcoming and founded the Seattle Chamber Music Society, which has continued to host summer festivals that feature some forty artists every season. During her thirty-year career as artistic director of the Society, Saks hired some 266 artists, many of whom were housed by Saks and her immediate neighbors. In 2012 Saks chose her replacement. He was James Ehnes, a former festival artist. Personal life In the late 1960s, Saks married philosopher and author David Berlinski and had two children, daughter Claire (born 1968) and son Mischa (born 1973), both of whom are published authors. Saks and Berlinski later divorced. In 2013, Saks was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer after persistent abdominal problems. Hoping to attend the Society's festival, she chose to forgo treatment and, on August 1, died at the age of 71. She is survived by her husband of 25 years, Martin Greene, and her two children.

Left alone after Margaret's death in 1880, Henrietta went on a continental tour with friends and an adopted daughter in 1884, and then moved to Oxford for twenty years and Bristol for two, before returning to London, where she died in Belsize Park Gardens on 6 January 1914.ODNB entry by Rosemary Mitchell.

Froude, Dinah Craik, Mrs Henry Wood, Jean Ingelow and others.ODNB entry. As a prolific writer of novels under the name Sarah Tytler, Keddie was an exponent of domestic realism, which was notably popular among female readers. Her first novel, The Kinnears. A Scottish Story (1852) went unnoticed, but she began to build up a following, particularly after her move to London. Many of her novels had an 18th-century background, including Citoyenne Jacqueline (1865) set in the French Revolution. In relation to her novel Beauty and the Beast (1884), about a private soldier who inherits a baronetcy, the literary biographer Rosemary Mitchell writes, \\"Although the plot is sensational, her talent for original and sympathetic characterization is considerable and her perception of the problems of social divisions keen and realistic.\\" Saint Mungo's City (1884, about Glasgow) was unusual in focusing on urban, rather than rural Scotland. Perhaps her most famous book was Logie Town (1887), set in her home village of Cupar.Orlando Project: Retrieved 2 August 2013. Mainly pay-walled.; ODNB entry. Keddie's work for children and young people was also popular. Papers for Thoughtful Girls (1862; the 1866 edition had illustrations by the Pre- Raphaelite painter John Everett Millais) and Sweet Counsel. A Book for Girls (1866) covered subjects such as intellect, friendship, self-sacrifice and fashion, revealing \\"moderately progressive views on women's roles.\\" She also did educational work, such as Musical Composers and their Works (1875) and The Old Masters and their Pictures for the Use of Schools and Learners in Art (1880), and biographical compendia such as Six Royal Ladies of the House of Hanover (1898). Another book of hers was Jane Austen and Her Works (1880), although a later Jane Austen biographer complained that she simply \\"filled her book with résumés of the novels.\\"Claire Harman: Jane's Fame: How Jane Austen Conquered the World (Edinburgh: Canongate, 2009), p. 156. Her final work was Three Generations: The Story of a Middle-Class Scottish Family (1911).Orlando Project; ODNB entry; Jarndyce catalogue. The Spectator, reviewing the novel The Blackhall Ghosts on 12 January 1889, had mixed feelings about the characterization: \\"The writer has made a fine character of Joanna Endicott. Queer she seemed to those who failed to see through her disguise, and she is almost an enigma to us.... However, she is a dignified woman, with deep feelings and a wonderful self-control, and her strange behaviour springs from one overpowering sentiment, the love of home and family. In her the writer has evidently embodied what she believes to be the ideal of a self-reliant, self- controlled woman, animated by a deep-rooted passion. As for her sister Celia, we must frankly say we do not understand her; she is a most extraordinary young lady, and is obviously overdrawn. A more nasty, cruel, and unnatural creature we have never met with in fiction.... Lucy's silliness is probably exaggerated, though she is by far the most natural.... All these portraits require more shading; they are too deeply lined, we might almost say, dug in.\\"The Spectator Archive. Retrieved 2 August 2013.

For example, some Floridian and Alabamian municipal flags feature a saltire, due to saltires being used on their states' flags. Some Maryland county flags feature the coat of arms of the Calvert family, as it is featured on the Maryland state flag, and due to the Calvert family's prominence in Maryland history. County flags were not always ubiquitous. Many counties went decades without a flag, until a certain event, such as a local sesquicentennial or the U.S. founding's bicentennial, spurred the creation of a flag. Frederick County, Maryland is one example, in 1976, it hosted a contest, asking the public to submit their designs to a commission. A panel then reviewed the five winning entries, choosing one to become the official county flag. Frederick County's example is typical of the flag adoption processes that many counties undertook with their flags. The 250th anniversary of Augusta County, Virginia's founding also spurred the creation of a flag, in 1988. Some flags, such as the flags of Montgomery County, Maryland, and Loudoun County, Virginia, were created by foreign entities, such as the College of Arms in the United Kingdom.

In 1972, Selinker introduced the concept of interlanguage, which built upon Pit Corder's previous work on the nature of language learners' errors. Corder's and Selinker's work became the foundation of modern research into second-language acquisition, and interlanguage is accepted as a basic principle of the discipline. Education Selinker received his B.A. from Brandeis University in 1959, where he studied Near-Eastern studies. He received his M.A. from The American University in 1960, in the subject of linguistics. Selinker studied at Georgetown University for his doctorate, which he received in 1966. Career After completing his PhD, Selinker moved to the University of Washington, where he became assistant professor of linguistics and director of English for foreign students from 1966 to 1975. From 1968 to 1969 he was a Fulbright scholar at the University of Edinburgh, where he researched the psycholinguistics of second-language acquisition. He left Washington in 1975, when he earned a Fulbright scholarship at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In Jerusalem, Selinker focused on advanced reading for second-language learners. In 1976-1977 he taught at San Jose State University. Selinker moved to the University of Michigan in 1977, and he remained there until his retirement in 1993. During his time in Michigan he served as a visiting professor at Carnegie Mellon University in 1991, and spent his third Fulbright scholarship at the University of Kassel in Germany in 1992. Following his career at Michigan, Selinker was appointed to a chair at Birkbeck College, University of London. There he served a turn as Head of the Department of Applied Linguistics, taught second language acquisition and supervised student research - both undergraduate and postgraduate. Interlanguage Selinker's most well-known contribution to the field of second-language acquisition is the concept of interlanguage. He first introduced interlanguage in his 1972 paper of the same name, which built on Pit Corder's 1967 article The Significance of Learners' Errors. Selinker's paper only mentioned Corder's in passing, but it nevertheless advanced his basic argument. The principle behind interlanguage theory is that the language of second-language learners is governed by systematic rules, and that these rules are different from those of the language being learned and from those of the learner's native language. Hence at every stage of learning, language learners do not merely copy what native speakers do, but create an entirely new language system unique to themselves. Selinker named this interim language system an interlanguage. In his 1972 paper, Selinker proposed that interlanguages have all the normal properties of natural languages. In other words, they are systematic and bound by rules in the same manner as any other language. Furthermore, Selinker proposed that interlanguage is based on three basic principles: over-generalization from patterns found in the language being learned, transfer from patterns found in the learner's native language, and fossilization, the phenomenon of a learner's language ceasing to develop.

It can be worn by men, women, and children. Chut thai for women usually consists of a pha nung or a pha chung hang, a blouse, and a pha biang. Northern and northeastern women may wear a pha sin instead of a pha nung and a pha chung hang with either a blouse or a suea pat. Chut thai for men includes a pha chung hang or pants, a Raj pattern shirt, with optional knee-length white socks and a pha biang. Chut Thai for northern Thai men is composed of a kangkeng sado, a white Manchu-styled jacket, and sometimes a khian hua. In formal occasions, people may choose to wear a so-called formal Thai national costume. History The Portraits of Periodical Offering of Imperial Qing by Xie Sui, 18th century painting in the National Palace Museum in Taipei. Du Royaume de Siam by Simon de La Loubère shows a Siamese official wearing lombok and pha chung hang and a traditional Thai house Historically, both Thai males and females dressed themselves with a loincloth wrap called pha chung hang. Men wore their pha chung hang to cover the waist to halfway down the thigh, whilst women wore their pha chung hang down the waist to well below the knee. Members of the nobility wore silk robes called khrui and a tall, pointed hat called lomphok in attendance of royal affairs. Bare chests and bare feet were accepted as part of the Thai formal dress code, and are observed in murals, illustrated manuscripts, and early photographs up to the middle–1800s. Prior to the 20th century, the primary markers that distinguished class in Thai clothing were the use of cotton and silk cloths with printed or woven motifs, but both commoners and royals alike wore wrapped, not stitched clothing. Traditional Thai attire changed significantly during the Rattanakosin period. Prior to the 1700s, Thai men and women both kept their hair long. However, following the Burmese–Siamese wars of 1759-1760 and 1765–1767 and repeated Burmese invasions into Ayutthaya, central Thai women began cutting their hair in a crew-cut short style, which remained the national hairstyle until the 1900s. From the 1860s onward, Thai royals \\"selectively adopted Victorian corporeal and sartorial etiquette to fashion modern personas that were publicized domestically and internationally by means of mechanically reproduced images.\\" Stitched clothing, including court attire and ceremonial uniforms, were invented during the reign of King Chulalongkorn. Western forms of dress became popular among urbanites in Bangkok during this period. During the early–1900s, King Chulalongkorn encouraged Thai women to wear long hair instead of traditional short hair which later became a trend during the reign of King Vajiravudh along with wearing pha sin (ผ้าซิ่น), a tubular skirt, instead of the pha chung hang (โจงกระเบน), a cloth wrap. On 15 January 1941, Plaek Pibulsonggram issued a Thai cultural mandate to modernize and Westernize Thai dress, by deeming the long-practiced customs of wearing underpants, wearing no shirt, or wearing a wraparound cloth, as forms of inappropriate public attire.The Royal Gazette, Vol. 58, Page 113. January 21, B.E. 2484 (C.E. 1941). Retrieved on June 4, 2010. Traditional Costumes =Pha chung hang= Pha chung hang () or Chang kben () is a lower-body, wrap around cloth. It is synonymous with the Khmer sampot. The pha chung hang is a long, rectangular cloth worn around the lower body. The traditional dress is similar to the dhoti of South Asia. The pha chung hang resembles pants more than skirts. It is a rectangular piece of cloth measuring three meters long and one meter wide. It is worn by wrapping around the waist, stretching it away from the body, twisting the ends together then pulling the twisted fabric between the legs and tucking it in the back of the waist. =Pha nung= Thai women wearing pha sin dress for Rocket Festival, Roi Et The pha nung (), also known as pha sin () or pha thung (), is a long fabric worn around the waist that resembles a long skirt.James C. Ingram. Economic change in Thailand 1850-1970. Stanford University Press, 1971, p. 10 By Thai girls wearing northern Thai pha sin =Pha biang= Thai women wearing Pha biang, Jim Thompson House Pha biang ( ) or Sbai ( ) is shawl-like garment, or breast cloth. Pha Biang can be used by women or men. The Pha Biang is also known as a long piece of silk, about a foot wide, draped diagonally around the chest by covering one shoulder which its end drops behind the back. Pha Biang could be worn around the naked chest or on top of another cloth. The practice of wearing Pha Biang along with Victorian era costumes was a common practice during the reign of King Chulalongkorn and lasted until the reign of King Vajiravudh when Westernized clothing became more fashionable. The wearing of Pha Biang as daily wear was officially banned by Plaek Pibulsonggram during Thailand's clothing reform. =Suea pat= Suea pat ( ) is a long-sleeved shirt with no buttons. It is worn by wrapping the right side of the front panel of the shirt over the left side of the front panel, and the two panels are tied together via strings. Suea pats are typically worn by northern Thai women =Raj pattern= King Chulalongkorn wearing the raj pattern costume, consisting of a white Nehru- style jacket with five buttons and a pha chung hang. Raj pattern refers either to a Thai men's costume consisting of a white Nehru-style jacket with five buttons, a pha chung hang, knee-length socks, and dress shoes (, ) , or to the specific form of the jacket itself (, ). It was worn chiefly during the late-19th and early-20th centuries by government officials and the upper class in Bangkok, and nowadays is used in select circumstances as a national costume. Formal costume The formal Thai costume, (, literally, 'Thai dress of royal endorsement'), includes several sets of dress, designed as the Thai national costume at formal occasions. Although described and intended for use as national costume, it is of relatively modern origins, having been conceived in the second half of the 20th century.

The company states its mission on its website is to grow food where people live and grow it more sustainably. The company, founded in 2009, has installed commercial greenhouses on the rooftops of several large industrial buildings in the greater Montreal area, the first of which, located in the Ahuntsic borough of Montreal, was the world's first rooftop commercial greenhouse.  Description  Mohamed Hage, founder of Lufa Farms talks to Silver Donald Cameron.Lufa Farms believes that the current food system is not sustainable and that cities need to transition to a new food production model that’s self-sufficient enough to continue to feed a growing metropolitan population. The company achieves this by growing more food, closer to where people live, while using less space and resources to minimize environmental impacts, and remaining completely transparent. With three rooftop greenhouses in the Montreal area, the company currently has 138,000 square feet of growing space where dozens of types of vegetables are grown. The company currently delivers around 20,000 baskets every week to over 500 pick-up points across Quebec, and in 2020, upon completion of their fourth greenhouse, the 164,000-square-foot space will enable them to feed up to 2% of Montreal households.  History  = 2009 = CEO and founder Mohamed Hage was born in Lebanon and grew up surrounded by rooftop gardens. Upon moving to Canada, he was surprised to find that vegetables often travel over 2,000 km before being eaten. It was this knowledge combined with the simplicity and accessibility of rooftop farms that led him to bring together a team to tackle the mission to encourage cities to eat locally and responsibly. There was Lauren Rathmell to manage the greenhouses and plant science, Kurt Lynn for his decades of marketing experience, and Yahya Badran to manage the construction and engineering projects. = 2010 = The company began construction of their first commercial rooftop greenhouse in the Ahuntsic borough of Montreal. In addition to the 31,000 square feet of vegetable production, the two-story building also served as the company's head office and distribution centre. Currently, it houses the company's herb, micro-greens, cucumber, and pepper production using both horizontal and vertical farming systems. = 2011 = The company harvested their first rooftop vegetables and began delivering weekly baskets to their first cohort of clients, aptly named \\"Lufavores\\" (a contraction between 'Lufa' and 'locavore'). At that time, the company grew only 40 varieties of vegetables and delivered to about 200 customers without the option to customize the order. The baskets were delivered steps from customers doors thanks to a network of neighbourhood pick-up points (PUPs). = 2013 = Lufa Farms built their second rooftop greenhouse in the neighbouring city of Laval, measuring 43,000 square feet and currently housing the company's tomato and eggplant production. In order to offer more variety, they partnered with hundreds of local farmers and foodmakers to offer Lufa Farms' rooftop-grown vegetables, as well as thousands of seasonal field fruit and vegetables, baked-to-order bread, seafood, and more. These partnerships brought the launch of the company's online farmers’ market, the Marketplace. = 2016 = The company went through a period of major growth. The total number of weekly baskets exceeded 10,000 and the company had to double its workforce to keep up. It was also the year that Lufa Farms' eco home delivery by electric car was launched and the company became cash-flow positive. = 2017 = Lufa Farms built their third rooftop greenhouse in the Anjou suburb of Montreal. This greenhouse, which was both their largest and most technologically advanced, grew the company's growing space to 138,000 square feet and allowed the company to expand production capacity to include more than one hundred varieties of vegetables, and feed over 10,000 Montreal households year-round. = 2019 = The company outgrew their Ahuntsic location, and moved their main offices and distribution centre to Ville Saint-Laurent where they began construction on their fourth, and largest rooftop greenhouse. = 2020 = The company is forecasting the completion of their Ville Saint Laurent greenhouse for the spring of 2020. Once finished, it will become the world's largest rooftop greenhouse at 164,000 square feet (about three football fields) and will house the company's complete tomato and eggplant production. The surface area will be greater than all three of their current greenhouses combined and will double the company's growing capacity, allowing them to feed up to 2% of Montreal households with local vegetables.  Advantages of rooftop farming  = No new land = Lufa Farms opts for growing food on rooftops as it uses no new land, gives purpose to unused spaces, and enables food to be grown locally instead of being transported from miles away. Rooftop farms help to mitigate the problem of wasted heat islands, filter CO2, and put oxygen back into the air. = Saving water = Lufa Farms grows their food in a coconut fibre substrate using a hydroponic system. Water is recirculated and rain and meltwater are added into the closed-loop system, effectively using 50% less water than a farm of comparable size not recirculating water. = Saving energy = Rooftop greenhouses trap and use the residual heat let off from the building below and act as a protective buffer against the elements, thereby reducing the building's heating needs. Through the use of energy curtains and natural gas heaters, Lufa Farms' greenhouses use about half the energy used to heat an equivalent, ground-level greenhouse. In the summer, natural plant transpiration cools the greenhouse and consequently helps to mitigate the heat island effect produced by black tar rooftops. = Controlling Pests = Lufa Farms uses no synthetic herbicides, fungicides, or pesticides. Instead, they rely primarily on bio-controls consisting of the introduction of predatory insects. = Reducing waste = Green waste is composted and sold on Lufa Farms' Marketplace or is sent to municipal or other partner composting sites.

Founded in 2010, the ICMAT headquarters is located in the Cantoblanco Campus in Northern Madrid. The ICMAT is composed of the mathematicians belonging to the CSIC and researchers from the three Madrid universities. The structure and composition of the center was based on an initial selection carried out with the assistance of the National Agency for Public Education (Agencia Nacional de Evaluación y Prospectiva – ANEP) after a public call issued to all interested parties. Research at the ICMAT The ICMAT is an institute where work on a broad range of mathematics is conducted, including the transfer of knowledge and results. Initially the main fields of research are as follows: Mathematical Analysis, Differential Geometry, Algebraic Geometry, Partial Differential Equations, Fluid Mechanics, Dynamical Systems, Geometric Mechanics and Mathematical Physics. In addition to the inclusion of research lines in Number Theory, Group Theory and Combinatorics in 2011. Among the research results obtained by researchers from the Institute that have so far had the greatest impact, it is worth mentioning the [solution to the Nash problem in Singularity Theory http://annals.math.princeton.edu/2012/176-3/p11] by Javier Fernández de Bobadilla and María Pe; the [solution to the Sidon problem in Number Theory by Javier Cilleruelo and Carlos Vinuesa https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.5024]; the [solution to the Arnold conjecture in Hydrodynamics http://annals.math.princeton.edu/2012/175-1/p09] by Daniel Peralta Salas and Alberto Enciso; the [construction of the mathematical model for explaining how water waves break http://www.pnas.org/content/109/3/733.short] by the research team led by Diego Córdoba, and the recent results on [Lagrangian transport and their applications to the study of the ozone layer http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JAS-D-12-0274.1] by the team led by Ana María Mancho.  History of the ICMAT  = Background to the ICMAT = The ICMAT emerged from the Department of Mathematics at the CSIC Institute of Mathematics and Fundamental Physics, to which mathematicians belonging to the CSIC were assigned. The agreement for the creation of the center was signed in November, 2007, after assessment through the 2006–2009 Strategic Plan, to which all the centers connected with the CSIC are subject and in which the international commission recommended the establishment of a separate institute. A look back over the long history of the CSIC reveals what may be regarded as forerunners of the ICMAT: the Laboratorio Seminario Matemático of the Junta de Ampliación de Estudios (JAE) created in 1915, and the Instituto Jorge Juan de Matemáticas, created in 1939 by the CSIC. = The ICMAT, Severo Ochoa Center of Excellence = In 2011 the ICMAT was chosen as one of the eight centers of excellence in the Severo Ochoa Program call for submissions issued by the then Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology (MICYT). Among other distinctions, six ICMAT researchers have obtained European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grants, which places the Institute in the foremost position in Europe in mathematics.  Outreach at the ICMAT  Every year the ICMAT participates in the Science and Technology Week, the Science in Action competition (the ICMAT being one of the organizing institutions) and since 2012 has participated in Researchers’ Night (in collaboration with the UAM). Furthermore, the ICMAT has launched the Matemáticas en la Residencia program (in collaboration with the Residencia de Estudiantes and the CSIC) in which international figures for the public understanding of science such as Marcus du Sautoy, Jesús María Sanz-Serna, Pierre Cartier, Guillermo Martínez, Edward Frenkel, Christiane Rousseau, Antonio Durán and John Allen Paulos have taken part, as well as the Graffiti and Maths competition, which is aimed at secondary school students. The blog Mathematics and its Frontiers has an annual readership of 150,000, in addition to the presence of the Institute in social networks: Facebook and Twitter. In March, 2013, the ICMAT officially became a Scientific Culture Unit recognized by the FECYT (Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology), and is the only mathematical institution to enjoy this distinction.  Location and facilities  = ICMAT facilities = The ICMAT is located in a new building on the UAM campus and has one auditorium with a capacity for 270 people, a lecture hall that holds 140 and another that holds 80, as well as three more with a capacity of 50, 40 and 30 people, respectively. It also has a library of 1,100 square meters, a large computation area and offices for some 200 researchers. These facilities are ideal for the celebration of thematic programs, congresses, schools and seminars. = The ICMAT on the UAM+CSIC International Campus of Excellence = The ICMAT forms part of the Theoretical Physics and Mathematics strategic axis on the UAM+CSIC International Campus of Excellence.

History Terry and Rhonda White opened their first pharmacy in Woody Point, Queensland in 1959. Their network of owned pharmacies grew steadily over the years, with the brand becoming well-known and respected in community pharmacy in South East Queensland. In 1994, they established one of the first pharmacy franchises in Australia, providing a comprehensive range of services to franchisees based on their successful retail pharmacy model. The Terry White Chemists franchise network continued to grow over the next 11 years and, in 2015, the Group became the parent company of the Chemplus brand. This took the total number of franchised pharmacies within the Terry White Group to 225. In August 2016, the Terry White Group announced a merger with Chemmart, which created a pharmacy chain with over 500 stores nationally and an annual turnover of A$2 billion. All stores have since been rebranded under the new combined chain with a new name, logo and branding. Since the merger, Terry White Chemmart is now the largest pharmacy group in Australia. Controversy On 1 December 2016, Terry White Chemists came under fire, after a single franchisee (who is at liberty \\"stock and sell products at their discretion\\"), displayed golliwogs underneath a sign reading “Experience a White Christmas”; presumably a pun referring both to the name Terry White Chemists and the popular phrase White Christmas. The alarm about the golliwog dolls was raised when Toowoomba man George Helon spotted the dolls placed beneath the sign and posted a picture of it on Facebook and Twitter. Australian Aboriginal activist, author and filmmaker Stephen Hagan described Toowoomba as the \\"most racist city in Australia\\". Terry White Chemists subsequently banned the sale of such dolls from sale from any franchise nationwide, and the franchisee \\"unreservedly apologised\\" for the \\"regrettable error\\".

Life He was the elder son of Robert Colville of Ochiltree and Margaret Logan. He was one of the commissioners to parliament on 15 February 1525, and was appointed to the office of comptroller before 1527. In 1529 he exchanged the lands of Ochiltree with James Hamilton of Finnart for the lands of Easter Wemyss and Lochorshyre in Fifeshire. The same year he was appointed a director of the chancery. He was one of the commissioners to parliament on 24 April and 13 May 1531, 15 December 1535, and 29 April 1536. He was nominated a lord of the articles on 13 May 1532 and 7 June 1535, and at the latter date was chosen a commissioner for the taxation of £6,000 voted by the three estates to James V of Scotland on his approaching marriage. On the institution of the College of Justice in 1532, Colville was appointed one of the judges on the temporal side of the bench, and was knighted. He was one of the commissioners at the truce of Newcastle on 8 October 1533, and was sent again into England to treat for peace in the following year. For siding with the Douglases he was in 1538 deprived of the office of comptroller, and on 30 May 1539 a summons of treason was executed against him for affording them countenance and assistance. He appeared to answer to the charge before the parliament on 18 July 1539, when the only charge persisted in against him was that while comptroller he, on 14 July 1528, had made a pretended assignation for the benefit of Archibald Douglas of Kilspindy, when he knew that a summons of treason against him had been at that time executed. For this he was ordered on 21 August to enter himself in ward in Blackness Castle. He disobeyed this order, and, back in England, associated with Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus, and his brother in treason attempts against the Scottish king. Colville died in 1540. On 10 January 1541, a summons was executed against his widow and children, on account of his having incurred the crime of lèse-majesté. His estate was annexed to the crown, but was then bestowed on Norman Leslie of Rothes. The forfeiture was rescinded in parliament on 12 December 1543, under the direction of Cardinal Beaton. Family Colville was twice married: *first, to Alison, eldest daughter of Sir David Bruce of Clackmannan, and, *second, to Margaret Forrester, who survived him. Colville had a son and a daughter by each marriage, the son of the second marriage being Alexander Colville, the lord of session. He had also an illegitimate son, Robert, ancestor of the Lord Colvilles of Ochiltree.

It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1970 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. History Orrin White lived in Palmyra, New York, where he worked as a merchant and married Ann Thayer. In 1823, White journeyed to Michigan and claimed land along the Huron River. He wrapped up his affairs in New York, then returned in 1824 with his wife Ann and father-in-law Nathan Thayer to permanently settle his land. White built a small shanty where Huron High School now stands, becoming the first settler of Ann Arbor Township outside the village of Ann Arbor. In the 1920s, several hundred Native Americans camped in that area annually, while en route to Windsor to receive treaty gifts from the British (their allies in the War of 1812). White was very active in the Ann Arbor community, serving as Washtenaw County Commissioner in 1827, sheriff in 1832, associate Circuit Court judge from 1833–37, constitutional convention delegate in 1835, and on the state legislature in 1842. Between 1836 and 1840, Orrin and Ann White built this house out of cobblestones, one section at a time, using patterns typically found in New York. The Whites may have had help from local builder Steven Mills, who built the nearby Ticknor-Campbell House. Orrin White died in 1864. The Orrin White House was fully restored by Robert and Nan Hodges in the 1970s and 1980s. The structure remains in excellent condition and is still used as a private residence. Description The Orrin White House is a two-story frame house covered with cobblestones, built in an L shape with a side-gable rectangular portion and an addition to the rear. The front facade features herringbone patterned cobblestones, while on the remaining elevations the cobblestones are laid randomly.

Hyperkinetic disorder when diagnosed via the ICD-10 criteria give rates of between 1 and 2 percent in this age group. Cited source of Cowen (2012): Children in North America appear to have a higher rate of ADHD than children in Africa and the Middle East - however, this may be due to differing methods of diagnosis used in different areas of the world. If the same diagnostic methods are used rates are more or less the same between countries. Africa It is estimated that ADHD affects between 5.4-8.7% of children in Africa. Data quality however is not high. Germany A 2008 evaluation of the “KiGGS” survey, monitoring 14,836 girls and boys (age between 3 and 17 years), showed that 4.8% of the participants had an ADHD diagnosis. While 7.9% of all boys had ADHD, only 1.8% girls had it, too. Another 4.9% of the participants (6.4% boys : 3.6% girls) were suspected ADHD cases, because they showed a rate ≥7 on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) scale. The number of ADHD diagnoses was 1.5% (2.4% : 0.6%) among preschool children (3–6 years old), 5,3 % (8.7% : 1.9%) at age 7–10 years, and had its peak at 7.1% (11.3% : 3.0%) in the age group of 11–13 years. Among 14 to 17 years old adolescents the rate was 5.6% (9.4% : 1.8%). – Kapitel 2.8 Aufmerksamkeitsdefizit-/Hyperaktivitätsstörung (ADHS), S. 57 . See also Spain Rates in Spain are estimated at 6.8% among people under 18. United Kingdom In some parts of England there were waiting lists of five years or more for ADHD adult diagnostic assessment in 2019. United States thumbPercent of United States youth 4–17 ever diagnosed with ADHD as of 2007 Percent of United States youth 4–17 ever diagnosed with ADHD as of 2003 In the United States it is diagnosed in 2-16 percent of school children. The rates of diagnosis and treatment of ADHD are much higher on the east coast of the United States than on its west coast. The frequency of the diagnosis differs between male children (10%) and female children (4%) in the United States. This difference between genders may reflect either a difference in susceptibility or that females with ADHD are less likely to be diagnosed than males. Boys outnumber girls across all three subtyping categories, but the exact magnitude of these differences seems to depend on both the informant (parent, teacher, etc.) and the subtype. In two community-based investigations, conducted by DuPaul and associates, boys outnumbered girls by only 2.2:1 in parent-generated samples and 2.3:1 in teacher-based input. Changing rates Rates of ADHD diagnosis and treatment have increased in both the United Kingdom and the United States since the 1970s. This is believed to be primarily due to changes in how the condition is diagnosed and how readily people are willing to treat it with medications rather than a true change in the frequency. In the UK an estimated 0.5 per 1,000 children had ADHD in the 1970s, while 3 per 1,000 received ADHD medications in the late 1990s. In the UK in 2003, 3.6 percent of male children and less than 1 percent in female children had the diagnosis. In the United States the number of children with the diagnosis increase from 12 per 1000 in the 1970s to 34 per 1000 in the late 1990s, to 95 per 1,000 in 2007, and 110 per 1,000 in 2011. It is believed that the changes to the diagnostic criteria in 2013 from the DSM 4TR to the DSM 5 will increase the number of people with ADHD especially among adults.

For over 100 years it ran from Letmathe via Iserlohn, Hemer and Menden to Fröndenberg. The section between Hemer and Iserlohn and the branch line from Hemer to Sundwig have been closed and dismantled. History The construction of its first inter-regional line by the Bergisch-Märkische Railway Company (Bergisch-Märkische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, BME) bypassed various nearby towns such as Iserlohn. In the second half of the 19th Century the BME began to provide connections from its main line, the Elberfeld–Dortmund railway, to isolated places in the western Sauerland. = Iserlohn-Letmathe–Iserlohn = Iserlohn-Letmathe station First, the BME opened a branch line to Iserlohn station on 31 March 1864. This is also locally called the Iserlohner Bahn (Iserlohn Railway). This branch started from Iserlohn-Letmathe station in the Genna district, which five years earlier had been opened by the BME on the Ruhr–Sieg railway from Hagen to Siegen. The line was upgraded in the following years; during this work Dechen Cave was discovered in 1868. Letmathe- Dechenhöhle station was built close to the show cave. = Fröndenberg–Menden = Eight years later the BME built another branch line, this time starting from Fröndenberg station via its Upper Ruhr Valley Railway to Menden (Sauerland) station. It was completed on 7 August 1872. This line was extended initially by Rödinghausen by the then königlichen Eisenbahndirection Elberfeld (Royal railway division of Elberfeld) of the Prussian state railways (PSE) in 1878. This later developed into the Hönne Valley Railway to Neuenrade. = Menden–Hemer = Plans for the extension of the line from Menden to Hemer go back to the 1860s. On 17 April 1873 the BME had signed a contract to build a line and secured funding from the Prussian ministry of trade. In 1881, the BME received a concession to build the line, but it was completed on 1 September 1882 shortly after the takeover of the BME by the PSE. = Hemer–Iserlohn = On 15 June 1885, the last section was completed between Hemer and Iserlohn. Thus, it was possible to run from Letmathe via Iserlohn, Hemer and Menden to Fröndenberg. A second railway was opened to Iserlohn as the Ardey Railway from Schwerte (Ruhr) 25 years later.  Closures  Former Iserlohn Ost station =Hemer–Iserlohn = More than a hundred years after the opening of the line for passengers on the middle section between Iserlohn and Menden, services were closed on the same section on 28 May 1989 and the line between Iserlohn Ost and Hemer was completely shut down and dismantled during the next three years. The reason for the closure was a ramshackle bridge over state road L680, which spanned the line. In the last years before the closure, it had to be given additional support with steel beams. Six years later, the remaining section in the city center of Iserlohn, which was nearly one and a half km- long, was closed on 27 May 1995. = Menden–Hemer = Special train for the state garden show on 31 July 2010 in Hemer Freight traffic on the Menden–Hemer section was closed up to 31 March 2006 and it was offered publicly for re-use six months later. On 14 April 2007, it was converted into a siding to Menden station. From 11 June 2007 to 31 May 2008, this siding was then rented by the town of Hemer to carry uprooted trees after hurricane Kyrill. During the early planning for Landesgartenschau Hemer 2010 (State Garden Show Hemer 2010) consideration was given to re-opening the line. In November 2007, the Hemer transport committee decided that it no longer wish to pursue this idea because in the opinion of experts no rail services would result. Instead, it considered converting the line into a cycle path. But in order to restore the track, the Rhein-Sieg-Eisenbahn GmbH (RSE), based in Bonn, filed a lawsuit in the autumn of 2008 against the Federal Railway Authority (Eisenbahn-Bundesamt) in the Administrative Court in Arnsberg to prevent the imminent dismantling of the tracks and filed an application for the authority to operate the line as a railway infrastructure company. The RSE would withdraw the lawsuit if the town of Hemer negotiated a cooperative agreement for the reactivation and operation of the line. The town of Hemer finally acquired the track on 23 December 2008 in order to take advantage of railway land to the south of Hemer station that was no longer required so that it could be used for its urban renewal project. After the operation of the line during the State Garden Show 2010, it was closed again on 1 November 2010 at the request of the RSE. In 2012, there was great controversy over the policy to rebuild the line between Hemer and Menden as a cycle path. On 7 September 2012, it was announced that the CDU and the Green-Alternative List of the town of Menden would not agree to the immediate dismantling of the railway between Menden and Hemer. The local CDU leader Martin Wächter would only make a decision on a possible dismantling of the railway when the results of a potential study by Zweckverbands Schienenpersonenverkehr Ruhr-Lippe (Association for Passenger Rail Transport of Ruhr-Lippe, ZRL) presented the opportunities for realising a Hemer–Menden–Dortmund service.  Current situation  Currently, only the two sections at both ends of the rail line, which were the first sections opened, are still in operation. Iserlohn town station = Iserlohn-Letmathe–Iserlohn = The Iserlohn Railway, the oldest section of the line, is still in operation and runs, since the incorporation of the former municipality of Letmathe into Iserlohn, completely within the limits of Iserlohn. This stretch has remained as a single-track branch line, in contrast to the Ardey Railway, but it has been electrified since 30 May 1965. Since the dismantling of the line to Hemer, Iserlohn station has become a curiosity, as it is the terminus of two different lines. Currently it is not possible to change from one line to the other, but there are plans to allow connections by installing sets of points to allow changes. Until the end of 2007, the line has been served by Regionalbahn service RB 56 (Der Iserlohner) from Hagen to Iserlohn, operated by DB Regio NRW with a class 143 locomotive hauling a single double-deck carriage. Since the timetable change on 9 December 2007, Abellio Rail NRW has operated passenger services over the Ruhr-Sieg Network as a result of winning a contract in the summer of 2005 for the twelve years up to 2019. Between Iserlohn-Letmathe and Iserlohn, Abellio Rail currently operates Regional- Express service RE 16 (the Ruhr-Sieg-Express) and Regionalbahn service RB 91 (the Ruhr-Sieg-Bahn) hourly. The two services, the RE 16 from Essen via Hagen and the RB 91 from Hagen are uncoupled at Iserlohn-Letmathe station. The section of the trains that does not go to Iserlohn continues to Siegen. These services are operated with FLIRT 2 electric multiple units in coupled sets. The operation of coupled sets allowed the number of direct connections to Hagen to be doubled and additional direct connections were created to the central Ruhr area. = Fröndenberg–Menden = The line from Fröndenberg to Menden was not electrified. It is now operated as a two-track branch line as part of the Hönne Valley Railway to Neuenrade. Between Fröndenberg and Menden, Regionalbahn service RB 54 (the Hönnetal-Bahn) runs every hour from Unna to Neuenrade (on weekends it only runs every two hours between Menden and Neuenrade). DB Regio NRW was awarded the contract for the operations from 2004 to 2016 using two part Alstom Coradia LINT 41 (DB Class 648) sets.

He was one of the leading instigators of Queen Gertrude's assassination in September 1213. Origin His only known brother was Michael Kacsics, Voivode of Transylvania (1209–1212) and Ban of Slavonia in 1212. As Michael and Simon suddenly appeared in Hungarian contemporary sources without genealogical antecedents, several scholars, including Croatian historian Ivan Majnarić considered their kindred may have been descendants of Omiš Kačićs, one of the Croatian \\"twelve noble tribes\\" described in the Pacta conventa and Supetar Cartulary. The brothers were first mentioned in the early 13th century, they possessed villages in Nógrád County, for instance Salgó and Hollókő. Majnarić argued the Kacsics brothers may have belonged to supporters of Duke Andrew in his rebellion against the elder brother and then king Emeric. Following the coronation of Andrew II in 1205, the brothers were probably gifted with estates in Hungary, establishing a new branch within the clan, which now became part of the Hungarian nobility. A relationship between Hungarian and Omiš Kačićs is identified primarily in the mention of Šimun Kačić in a document from 1178, with father Nikola and brother Jakov, and with brothers Borislav, Bogdan and other family members in a document from 1190. This source possibly reflects to Simon Kacsics. Earlier historical works considered that his father-in-law was the powerful baron Bánk Bár-Kalán, who served as Palatine of Hungary from 1212 to 1213. However Bánk's son-in-law, a certain Simon, who was mentioned by a royal charter of Stephen V from 1270, and who possibly also participated in the murder of Queen Gertrude, died without descendants. Simon Kacsics and his unidentified wife had two sons, John I and Simon II, and a daughter who became a nun. Historian János Karácsonyi considered the Salgói (or Salgay) noble family originated from Simon II, but Pál Engel improved the data and linked the family to other namesake member of the Kacsics kinship. In fact, Simon's branch remained marginal and died out shortly after 1299.Engel: Genealógia (Genus Kacsics 1.) Career Simon was appointed Ban of Slavonia in 1212, holding the dignity alongside his brother. A royal charter from 1228 confirmed that Simon, along with Peter, son of Töre, played a decisive role in the murder of Queen Gertrude of Merania in September 1213. His brother, Michael and Palatine Bánk Bár-Kalán probably also took part in the preparation of the assassination. After the return of Andrew II of Hungary from Halychina, only Peter was executed by impalement, the Kacsics clan could retain their estates and influence yet, due to political circumstances and the King's lack of internal support. As he owned estates in Transylvania, historians Majnarić and Tamás Körmendi considered, Simon Kacsics was identical with that Simon, who served as ispán (comes) of Szabolcs County and Master of the stewards (magister dapiferorum) in 1214. Following that this Simon was mentioned as Voivode of Transylvania in 1215. Later he functioned as ispán of Szatmár County in 1221. Béla, who long opposed his father's \\"useless and superfluous perpetual grants\\", was made Duke of Transylvania in 1226. He started reclaiming King Andrew's land grants throughout the country in 1228. He forced his father to confiscate the estates of those noblemen who had plotted against his mother one and a half decade earlier. Accordingly, Simon lost his lands and villages in Transylvania, including Marosvécs Castle (today in Brâncovenești, Romania), which were granted by Denis Tomaj and his clan (ancestors of the Bánffy de Losonc family). In his charter, Andrew referred to Simon's active participation in the murder of his consort. The land confiscation in 1228 might be a sign of the subsequent retaliation after an increased role in national politics by princes Béla and Coloman since the early 1220s, as historian Gyula Pauler argued. Historian Tamás Körmendi argued, it is quite unrealistic that Andrew II appointed Simon to baronial dignities after the murder, even his few opportunities for punish the perpetrators, as Pauler had claimed. Accordingly, Simon was not considered among the assassins of Gertrude immediately after the murder. As Simon was mentioned as armed participant in the act, it is presumable that he became a victim of power intrigues and accused of conspiracy purely out of political reasons. Although, Simon did not longer hold any offices after 1221, he probably remained influential due to his extensive possession of Széplak, which covered the region of Szászrégen (today Reghin, Romania) to the Halychinan border, which could cause a political showdown.

Constable. p. 317 The alternative name is Old Kinnairdy. History The castle is built on land that belonged to the Innes family from the late 14th century; an earlier tower was probably built in about 1420, that replaced a wooden motte and bailey structure. The castle was sold by the Innes family to Sir James Crichton of Frendraught in 1629. Subsequently it came to the Reverend John Gregory in 1647, then passed to his brother David, a doctor who has been claimed to be constructor of the first barometer. David's success in forecasting the weather with the help of the barometer led to his being accused, but not convicted, of witchcraft. The property was sold by his third son to Thomas Donaldson, a merchant from Elgin, who restored and re-roofed the castle during the eighteenth century, transforming it into a country house. The property returned to the Innes family in 1923, and they began restoration then. Structure The House is an L-plan tower, the stair tower being an addition. The entrance was originally on the first floor, being accessed by a removable wooden bridge from the parapet wall. There is a straight stair to the basement, which is vaulted. A late 16th-century two-storey hall range lies to the east; it was altered in 1857. In the hall there is an oak-panelled aumbry. The carvings on it, which are particularly fine, show the heads of Sir Alexander Innes and his wife Christian Dunbar, and the date 1493. Sir Alexander seems to have got into financial difficulties because of his taste for fine Flanders panelling. Thomas Innes of Learney, Lord Lyon King of Arms, introduced some of the heraldic decoration in the house, which he owned after the Second World War.

It premiered in the United States at Gold Coast International Film Festival on 25 October 2013.  Premise  Thea, a ten-year-old girl, lives with her mother in a town in East Sussex. One day while trailing the coast alone, she meets a man and becomes friends with him, starting a journey during which she finds possibilities she didn't know existed. Cast *David Thewlis as Norman *Emily Dunham as Thea *Shauna Macdonald as The Mother Production =Development= Wright directed and wrote the screenplay for the film as a part of her graduation course at London College of Communication. Wright produced the film by her own production company Bon Bon Lumiere along with Rosalind Steven. Funding were also provided by a fish and chip shop located at Dungeness and Romney Marsh, where most of the filming took place as London College of Communication rules state that films can be funded by voluntary donations only. =Filming= Filming took place at sparsely populated areas of Kent and East Sussex, including Dungeness, Romney Marsh, Lydd, Camber Sands, Rye Harbour, Winchelsea Beach and Dymchurch. Talking about the filming locations Wright said that \\"I wanted to make something personal and I’ve spent a lot of time in Dungeness, because my parents have a house just down the coast from there, so it has a strong connection to my family. Also, I was always a massive fan of Derek Jarman and he spent his last years there. I just love the strangeness of it, the bleakness. The more I’ve been there, the more I fall in love with it.\\" She also said that \\"Romney Marsh is an area where I spent a lot of time when I was a child. Growing up in a city such as London, it’s so confined sometimes that as a child there is no feeling of a horizon, there’s nothing beyond what you know. So for me I was so lucky to have that experience of spending a lot of time in open spaces such as Romney Marsh that I was able to gain that feeling of beyond. As a young child I was obsessed with horizons.\\" Music The score for Separate We Come, Separate We Go was composed by Tom Recknell, who composed the original score titled The Birds for the film. Reception The film received positive reception from critics after its premiere at Cannes Film Festival. Total Film in its review said that \\"it's a rather sweet, very personal story about a little girl who meets lovely David Thewlis and learns to stretch her limitations.\\" Nick de Semlyen of Empire praised Wright's direction by saying that \\"it's an impressive first work from someone who clearly has ambition to burn.\\"  References   External links  Bonnie Wright talks about Separate We Come, Separate We Go *Bonnie Wright Separate We Come, Separate We Go Interview Category:2010s coming-of-age drama films Category:British coming-of-age drama films Category:British independent films Category:British short films Category:British films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in Sussex Category:Films shot in Kent Category:Films set in Kent Category:Films shot in England Category:Films set in England Category:Student films Category:2012 short films Category:2012 independent films Category:2012 drama films ","title":"Separate We Come, Separate We Go"},{"id":"40135571","text":"is one of the Dōzen Islands in the Oki archipelago in the Sea of Japan.Teikoku's Complete Atlas of Japan, Teikoku-Shoin Co., Ltd., Tokyo, The island, 13.7 km2 in area, has a population of approximately 650 persons and is the smallest of the inhabited islands in the Oki archipelago in area and in population Administratively the island is administered by the village of Chibu in Shimane Prefecture. Much of the island is within the borders of Daisen-Oki National Park. Chibujima is the only island of the Oki Islands with tanuki. There are only about 650 people but probably more than 2000 tanuki. Geography Chiburijima is the smallest of the three major islands forming the Dozen group within the Oki archipelago approximately north of Honshu coast. These islands were formed when the caldera of single ancient volcanic island collapsed, leaving three islands in a ring formation. Chiburijima is generally mountainous, but the south central area is somewhat flat. There are a number of sea cliffs, particularly on the western side of the island which faces the open expanse of the Sea of Japan. The highest point is above sea level. The island's two most well-known natural features are and , a sea-cliff composed of red rock. As an island located in the Sea of Japan, Chibujima is within the Sea of Japan climate zone. Summers temperatures, though usually mild, are exacerbated by high humidity. Winter temperatures are also generally mild, though exacerbated by strong wind. The surrounding ocean has a warming effect, making winters milder than the mainland. Consequently, there is very little snow on Chibujima, and what snow does fall usually melts quickly. = Etymology of Chiburijima= Over time, Chiburijima has been written with various different kanji. These include the following, all of which are read \\"Chiburi\\": 知夫里, 知夫, 知夫利, 智夫, 道触 (see below), 知振, 千振, and 千波. There are two different theories regarding the name \\"Chiburi Island\\". The first is that the name came from the name of a Shinto kami enshrined on Chiburijima's offshore isle, . The god, named , was a protector of ships. Since Chiburihuma is the closest to the mainland of the Oki Islands, ships coming to and departing from Oki would stop on Chiburijima to ask the god for a safe voyage. Over time, the name \\"Chiburi\\" stuck and the island became known as \\"Chiburijima\\". A second theory is that the name came from the use of smoke signals sent between Chiburijima and the mainland for communication. Since Chiburijima is the closest, it was the easiest to see between the Oki Islands and the mainland. History The earliest evidence of human habitation of Chibujima is the tomb called located in Urumi. The tomb is dated to the Jōmon period, 4000 years before present. Other ancient tombs built in the Yayoi (2300 BP) and Kofun (1700 BP) periods were also found. Also, the Oki Islands, including Chiburijima, are mentioned in Japan's two most ancient texts, Kojiki and Nihon Shoki. In the Asuka period, the area became incorporated into the encompassing both Chiburi Island and Nishinoshima. The islands have been used as a place of exile from the Nara period, but are well known as the place of exile for ex- Emperor Go-Toba, and Emperor Go-Daigo during the Kamakura period.Ancient Tales and Folk-lore of Japan - A Story of Oki Islands After the Meiji restoration, the Oki Islands became part of Tottori Prefecture in 1871, but were transferred to Shimane Prefecture in 1881. Modern Chibu Village was established in 1909. Red cliffs of Chiburijima Transportation Chiburijima is connected by regular ferry service from Saigo Port on Dōgojima, as well as by direct ferry service to points on mainland Japan.

This led to cheating accusations against him, and he was subsequently banned by the Bulgarian Chess Federation in December 2013, and stripped of his FIDE Master title and excluded from FIDE's rating list in January 2014.Former FIDE rating card of Borislav Ivanov Chess career Ivanov currently mainly resides in Blagoevgrad, where he was born. He is enrolled as a pedagogy student at the South-West University. His first coach was Marin Atanasov from Victory Club in Blagoevgrad and his chess idols are Veselin Topalov and Tigran Petrosyan. In August 2012, Ivanov won the Balkan chess festival for non-professionals held in Belogradchik. His major breakthrough came at the strong 2012 Zadar Open chess tournament in Croatia held between 16 and 22 December, during which he finished in fourth place after defeating a number of higher-ranked players and also increased his Elo rating by 70 points. His tournament record against the grandmasters he faced was 3 wins, 2 draws and 1 loss. It was alleged that he had been using outside help, but no evidence was uncovered and Ivanov received an apology and an invitation to future tournaments from the organizers. At the time, Ivanov's achievement was lauded by key figures from the Bulgarian Chess Federation and he was personally congratulated by executive director Nikolay Velchev, who saw in him a future member of the Bulgarian national chess team. On 14 April 2013, Ivanov defeated grandmaster Kiril Georgiev in a tournament held in Kyustendil, eventually winning the competition after finishing joint first with Grigor Grigorov, scoring 7½/9 points (securing the victory due to tiebreaker criteria). Kiril Georgiev alleged irregularities in the nature of Ivanov's tournament play. In April 2013, in part due to accusations levelled against Ivanov during his previous tournament victory, more than twenty Bulgarian Grandmasters and International Masters signed a petition that they will not participate in chess tournaments together with Ivanov unless special anti-cheating measures are taken. Shortly after that the Bulgarian Chess Federation banned him for four months on ethics grounds—due to comments made about other chess players rather than the suspicions of cheating. In response to the controversy, Grandmaster Veselin Topalov, ranked No. 1 in Bulgaria, stated in an interview on 21 May 2013 that there is no evidence that Ivanov is cheating, and that \\"it's simply stupid to blame a chess player for performing well on the board\\". The validity of the chess federation's decision was disputed in court and Ivanov received support from Blagoevgrad city councillors (who sent out a protest note to the chess federation) as well as public figures from other cities. In June 2013, the administrative court of Sofia stated that the sanction imposed on Ivanov by the chess federation had violated proper legal procedures, essentially confirming that Ivanov is free to participate in tournaments. On 19 June 2013 the Bulgarian Chess Federation organized an event (including a lie detector) that was supposed to clear Ivanov from the cheating accusations, but Ivanov did not appear. In a letter addressed to the chess federation, Ivanov said that he had been unable to make it to Sofia on the chosen date due to his intended participation in the Varna Open chess tournament (enabled by the recent lifting of the four-month ban by the administrative court) in particular and his tight schedule in general. He also expressed a willingness to undergo all the necessary tests, but under the condition that he is notified of the next such possibility at least 15 days in advance and is accompanied by his lawyer Mihail Ekimdzhiev. However, in Ivanov's view, the Bulgarian Chess Federation has refused to offer him any further opportunities to subject himself to rigorous testing of that nature. Retirement from competitive chess and brief return to chess-related activities On 4 October 2013, Ivanov announced his retirement from competitive chess. Ivanov's retirement came shortly after a controversial performance in a tournament in Blagoevgrad, in which Ivanov, among other things, voluntarily forfeited his games after refusing to be searched for suspected cheating devices, was observed walking in a \\"gangsta\\" fashion with a limp, and referred to one of his opponents, Grandmaster Maxim Dlugy, as a \\"clown\\".ChessBase News  The shoe assistant – Ivanov forfeits at Blagoevgrad According to Ivanov's version of the events, Dlugy had brought his own personal security officer to the tournament room during the competition in question in violation of procedure (Dlugy's guard eventually heeded the tournament officials' request to leave the competition room). Dlugy is also alleged to have applied pressure on chess referee Dimitar Iliev to extensively search Ivanov and require him to take off his shoes, which the latter refused, resulting in a loss by default for Ivanov. On 26 and 27 October 2013, Ivanov participated in the rapid chess Nayden Voynov Memorial Tournament in Vidin, scoring 6½/9 points and finishing 7th out of 61 players. In early December 2013, Ivanov played in the classical chess tournament XIX OPEN INT. NAVALMORAL DE LA MATA in Cáceres, Spain. After five rounds, he had scored 4½/5 points and was tied for the lead, ahead of 19 grandmasters. Ivanov was then excluded from the tournament, amid conflicting reports about the circumstances. The organisers subsequently issued a press release. According to the release, Ivanov had agreed to have his shoes searched after round 4, and no suspicious devices were found. However, suspicions were expressed about an apparent bulge in his back; one of the participants reported that he felt the bulge and concluded that it was an electronic device. Before his next scheduled game, his opponent, the Azerbaijani Grandmaster Namig Guliyev, asked that Ivanov be searched. While he was being frisked, Ivanov became agitated and refused to allow the search to continue. He then withdrew from the tournament. Ivanov has expressed disappointment regarding the way in which he was treated by his chess opponents and the general atmosphere surrounding the tournament in Spain. Prior to that, he had not been granted permission to compete in a tournament in Milan. On 8 December 2013, the Bulgarian Chess Federation banned Ivanov permanently. The FIDE Ethics Commission opened case 1/2014 against Ivanov via a report from the Executive Director. However, the case was not listed the September 2015 commission report (neither in the list of concluded cases nor in the list of pending cases).FIDE Ethics Commission report (Abu Dhabi), Sep 2015, Annex 52 Other pursuits Ivanov has also been employed as a chess coach and since 2014 has been studying law in the South-West University in Blagoevgrad. Media appearances In June 2013, he discussed his situation on the popular television talk show Slavi's Show, during which the host Slavi Trifonov also engaged in a telephone conversation with the vice-president of the chess federation Plamen Mollov. Arrest and alleged forgery ring In March 2017, Ivanov was arrested in Kyustendil due to allegedly masterminding a group engaged in forging driver's licenses and selling them on the Internet. The authorities were alerted to the scam by presenters from the comedy TV show Gospodari Na Efira.

The terminal is currently configured exclusively as a crude receiving terminal in order to supply the Irving Oil Refinery, which was itself constructed in 1960. Crude terminal infrastructure Canaport consists of the following infrastructure: * A floating mono-buoy located approximately southwest of Mispec Point to which tankers attach onto and swing freely 360° with the tide. * An undersea pipeline ( in length) that transfers crude oil from the mono-buoy to the shore. * Tanks on shore with over of storage capacity. * A land pipeline ( in length) that transfers crude oil from the storage tanks to the refinery in the east end of Saint John. The terminal was originally designed to have 5 storage tanks measuring in diameter. The owner of Irving Oil, K.C. Irving modified the terminal's design to include 6 tanks so each tank could each have a single letter that when combined would spell I-R-V-I-N-G when viewed from the water. Subsequent expansions of the refinery in the 1970s, 80s and 90s resulted in the construction of additional storage tanks. Canaport LNG Canaport LNG The Canaport facility viewed from the east. The LNG terminal jetty and LNG storage tanks are on the right. A supertanker carrying oil for the crude terminal is attached to the monobuoy on the left.The Canaport LNG terminal is a liquified natural gas (LNG) receiving and regasification terminal located adjacent and immediately east of the Canaport crude receiving terminal. Commissioned in 2008, it is Canada's first LNG terminal and the first LNG terminal built in eastern North America in 30 years. It is capable of receiving the largest LNG tankers in the world. Canaport LNG has a nominal capacity of handling of LNG per day, enough to heat 5 million homes. Regasified LNG from the Canaport LNG terminal is capable of supplying 20% of the natural gas demand in the northeastern United States and Canada. In 2001 Irving Oil applied for a permit to add liquified natural gas (LNG) to its Canaport deep-water crude receiving terminal. The permit was granted in April 2004 and Irving Oil entered into a partnership with Repsol S.A. to develop what is now called Canaport LNG; Irving Oil owns 25% of Canaport LNG while Repsol S.A. owns 75%. Construction of the LNG terminal started in September 2005 and the facility was commissioned in 2008 and received its first shipment of LNG in June 2009. Canaport LNG consists of the following infrastructure: * A pier, consisting of a terminal jetty constructed from 16 marine support jackets, 12 roadway and pipe support trestle sections, an LNG receiving platform, 10 mooring hooks, four berthing fenders, an access gangway and eight catwalk structures. Total structural steel weight is . Approximately of concrete form the road and platform deck. * Three (3) insulated storage tanks on shore. * A regasification facility using submerged combustion vaporizers to convert LNG into natural gas by warming it. The construction of the Canaport LNG was coincident with construction of the Brunswick Pipeline which transports the natural gas from Canaport LNG to markets. Controversy In 2005, Irving Oil received a controversial tax break from the City of Saint John to develop the Canaport LNG terminal; it was apparently negotiated one- on-one with the city's then-mayor Norm McFarlane. The tax concessions have cost the City of Saint John approximately $75 million over ten years, with a potential total loss of over $180 million. Saint John Common Council's reconsideration of this tax concession in 2015 resulted in warnings from Irving Oil, including editorials published in the Telegraph-Journal arguing against re-opening the deal. Proposed new oil export terminal Irving Oil has announced plans to build a new $300-million terminal at Canaport to export the oil from the proposed Energy East pipeline.

Event  On July 27, 2013, a pipeline owned by PTTGC Plc, a Thai state-owned oil company, burst while oil was being transferred from an undersea well to a tanker. PTTGC then followed the operation procedures for oil spill management. The Company used boats and airplanes to spray oil-spill dispersants, 0,612 litres of Slickgone NS and 6,930 litres of Super-Dispersant 25, which are permitted by the Department of Pollution Control to be used in Thailand, because they have low toxicity, are biodegradable and do not bio-accumulate or cause mutation and degeneration. It released also a boom to contain the spilled oil within the area. However, the boom did not work well due to bad weather.Investigation committee confirms oil slick volume of 54,000 litres, PTTGC follows operation procedure, reasonable volume of dispersant used. On the night of 28 July 2013, the oil leak (from a pipeline) from the beach at Ko Samet's Coconut Bay (Ao Phrao) resulted in the beach being closed and its tourists evacuated, after spillage reached the beach. On 4 August 2013 media said that the crude oil spill had occurred off of Thailand's mainland, \\"when a floating hose transferring oil from a tanker to a PTT refinery pipeline broke sending, PTT says, of oil spewing into the coastal waters\\". Two beaches have been closed due to uncertainty about water toxicity. Ko Samet is a popular tourist island, not far from Bangkok, off the coast of Ban Phe', Rayong. Concerns have been growing about the oil spill and the inconsistent information released. Ko Samet is close to Rayong and Map Ta Phut, and they have had a long history of environmental problems since they opened in 1990. About 25,000 people live in the Map Ta Phut municipality. In 1997, the pollution came to public attention when 1,000 pupils and teachers at a local school suffered from illnesses after inhaling toxic emissions and had to be hospitalized. An independent test carried out in 2005 demonstrated that airborne cancerous toxic chemicals released by Map Ta Phut Industrial Estate exceeded safety standards of developed nations by 60 to 3,000 times. The oil spill is in part connected to the oil operations at Map Ta Phut. Anthony Zola, an American environmental consultant is reported to have said \\"In rural areas, there is almost no enforcement at all. Water pollution, air pollution, noise pollution—you can make all the complaints you want, and no one pays any attention to you.\\" Map Ta Phut was closed down in 2009 by the previous Prime Minister, Abhisit Vejjaijiva due to safety concerns. The New York Times reported \\"Even among critics of the court decisions, there is widespread agreement that Map Ta Phut is heavily polluted and unhealthy for those who live nearby. But environmental experts remain skeptical that the court decisions will fix the problem.\\" Two days after the oil spill was discovered, PTT closed their War Room down according to Bangkok Post, and they have consistently since then tried to play down the effects of the spill. A week later they were saying it was safe to go to the beach and that it was clean. Greenpeace is concerned with the use of dispersants and the oil has sunk to the bottom and the full effects of the spill have yet to be understood. Mercury levels have also been reported to be 21 times safe limits. The dispersants also have negative effects and can cause cancers, kidney and liver problems. Some people swimming in the sea have reported dizziness. Bangkok Post reported \\"In 2012, a study found that Corexit increases the toxicity of oil by 52 times. It can remain in the ecological food chain for many years and cause widespread and long-lasting health impacts.\\" Oil spill hits Koh Samet Island  Estimates  Official reports said of oil were spilled, but critics of the oil company and the government say that the spill was much larger and warned of health risks posed both by the spill and by the chemicals being used to disperse the oil. A higher estimate of the oil spill has been performed by Somporn Chuai-aree of Prince Songkhla University: \\"as low as or as high as \\". This estimate is believed by associate professor Siwat Pongniumchan from the National Institute of Development Administration (Nida), who disbelieves previous estimates.  Effects  Tourism operators and officials were concerned about the effects on tourism in the area, as beaches in Rayong and on the nearby resort island of Ko Samet were impacted. A 14 August 2013 Bangkok Post article said that \\"Fishery Department director-general Wimol Jantrarotai said Chulalongkorn University lab tests on seafood found metal contamination in samples from fish markets near Koh Samet.\\" The oil company's information sheet given to media (on the beach) on 31 July, said that the oil dispersant used is \\"Slickgone NS\\". On 30 July 2013 Bangkok Post said that \\"authorities and more than 500 PTT employees have been struggling to prevent the slick spreading at the beach. They have tried to contain the spill, which has stretched almost along the bay, using containment booms to prevent further environmental damage in the area.\\" A 14 August 2013 Bangkok Post article said that \\"mercury levels found in sea water off Ao Phrao beach on Koh Samet were 29 times higher than safety standards allow, according to the Pollution Control Department. Furthermore \\"Niphon Phungsuwan, a marine expert from the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources, said more than 70% of coral at Ao Phrao had been bleached.\\" Bangkok Post reports \\"PTTGC has remained silent about what chemicals it is using but also said they could pose a hazard to the environment and people's health.\\" In 2012, a study found that Corexit increases the toxicity of oil by 52 times. It can remain in the ecological food chain for many years and cause widespread and long-lasting health impacts. \\"The use of dispersants is a solution that creates new and worse problems,\\" Ms Arpa said. The main ingredients of Corexit include 2-Butoxyethanol which can comprise up to 60% of the dispersant and is known to harm the blood, kidneys, liver and central nervous system. Some people swimming near Ko Samet have reported dizziness, and two beaches have been closed. Swimming is not recommended until more is known and the full environmental impacts have been independently verified. As of 20 August 2013, tourists are recommended to use caution if and when going swimming in the water, and to be careful of seafood for now. They should report dizziness of feeling unwell to the relevant authorities or to their embassy. On 31 August 2013 Bangkok Post said that the level of total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) \\"still exceeds safety standards\\".

In 1977, he became the first Nepali to receive the Ramon Magsaysay Award, for creating the Regmi Research Series. It was in recognition of his “chronicling of Nepal’s past and present, enabling his people to discover their origins and delineating national options.” In honor of the contributions made by Regmi to the scholarship on Nepal, the Kathmandu-based academic NGO Social Science Baha instituted the annual Mahesh C. Regmi lecture series in 2003, the first of which was attended by Regmi himself, just weeks before his death. Early life Born in Kathmandu in December 1929 to a family of musicians (who played the sitar), Regmi obtained school level education at home before completing four years of BA education at Kathmandu’s Trichandra College, then affiliated with Patna University. After trying out his hand in book and cloth trade in Calcutta, Regmi returned to Nepal just before the end of the Rana regime in February 1951. He began his professional life with the Nepali government in the immediate aftermath of the demise of the Rana oligarchy. He worked for the Department of Industries for several years before being dismissed for unspecified reasons in late 1955. Looking for something to do, he met an American academic who was researching the agricultural system of Nepal and was looking for someone to translate some documents into English. In an interview done in August 1992 by the German anthropologist Martin Gaenszle, Regmi recalled, “These were mainly reports of the land reforms commission of 1952-53. I tried to translate them and I got interested in this thing, one thing led to another and in 1957 I started this thing.” The ‘thing’ he was referring to was the Regmi Research Centre Pvt Ltd. Mahesh Chandra Regmi, one of Nepal’s foremost historians, died in the early hours of 10 July 2003. Regmi Research Centre Regmi functioned as a solitary historian at the Regmi Research Centre (sometimes called Institute), administratively helped by a small group of non-academic assistants, including, in the later years, his brother Rabish C Regmi and son Suresh C Regmi. Individuals such as Shankar M Amatya and Krishna M Arjyal helped Regmi go through thousands of documents held at the Records Office (‘Lagat Phant’) of the Department of Land Revenue in the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the library of the Ministry of Law and Justice, the Department of Survey, offices under the Guthi Corporation which look after the lands that once paid for the upkeep of Kathmandus temples and other public structures, and the Pashupatinath Temple. Documents from the above-mentioned sources were collected most intensively in the 1960s and the 1970s and were transcribed into thick volumes. These volumes, which were later referred to as the Regmi Research Collections, filled up the shelf space in his study and became Regmis personal archive based on which he produced 14 books on the economic and political history of 18th and 19th century Nepal. The first of these books was Some Aspects of Land Reform in Nepal (1960). It was followed by the four-volume study entitled Land Tenure and Taxation in Nepal (1963, 1964, 1965, 1968, Institute of International Studies, University of California at Berkeley; reprinted in a single volume in 1978 by Ratna Pustak Bhandar, Kathmandu). In 1971, Regmi published A Study in Nepali Economic History 1768-1846 in the Bibliotheca Himalayica series (started by late H K Kuloy) of the Manjusri Publishing House and five years later, the University of California Press published his Landownership in Nepal. These two works along with the earlier four-volume study established Regmi as a world-class scholar and in 1977 he became the first Nepali to receive the Ramon Magsaysay Award, receiving it for the “journalism, literature, and creative communication arts” category. The award was granted to him in recognition of his \\"chronicling of Nepals past and present, enabling his people to discover their origins and delineating national options.\\" Regmi published two books in the next two years: Thatched Huts & Stucco Palaces: Peasants and Landlords in 19th Century Nepal (1978, Vikas) and Readings in Nepali Economic History (1979, Kishor Vidya Niketan). In the decade of the 1980s, he published The State and Economic Surplus (1984, Nath Publishing House) and An Economic History of Nepal, 1846-1901 (1988, Nath Publishing House). In the following decade Regmi published Kings and Political Leaders of the Gorkhali Empire 1768-1814 (1995, Orient Longman), and Imperial Gorkha: An Account of Gorkhali Rule in Kumaun 1791-1815 (1999, Adroit). His last book Nepal: An Historical Miscellany (2002, Adroit) is a collection of various primary and secondary texts, translated into English from the original Nepali with additional commentary. At least ten of Regmis books are of outstanding quality and it is certain that they will continue to be the most influential texts of economic history of 18th and 19th century Nepal for at least another generation. He is the most appreciated but less read historian of Nepal. Paying for His Work Regmi's decision to open a private research institute in Nepal of the late 1950s was definitely extremely bold. So the question remains, how did he finance his scholarly operation? Regmi’s lifetime work was mainly supported through the sale of several services, most of which have by now been abandoned. These included the Nepal Press Digest (weekly summaries in English from the Nepali language press), the Nepal Press Report (daily summaries of the Nepali Press), the Nepal Recorder (translations of Nepali laws), Nepal Miscellaneous Series and the monthly Regmi Research Series. Among these, the first four contained information that was useful to both native and foreign academics and members of the expatriate development community in Nepal. The Series, which lasted from 1969 to 1989 contained English translations of important historical documents from the Regmi Research Collection and short historical analyses – often drafts of narratives that later appeared elsewhere – written by Regmi himself. It also contained short articles written by others, often translated from their original Nepali into English. This periodical was of interest mainly to serious researchers of Nepali society. In the 1992 interview by Gaenszle, Regmi justified his decision to discontinue the Series in December 1989: \\"Well, the first thing was that it was selling only about forty copies, forty subscriptions. It did not generate enough resources to hire people, assistants, things like that. That was the main problem. Another problem was that I couldnt find anyone with the competence to translate the old documents in the style I used. So it was a one-man show.\\" After crossing the age of 60, he added, he didn't \\"want to work nine hours a day. Thats not the goal of life. And then I decided to concentrate on my own writing, not just to give up the Regmi Research Series and sit quietly, playing with my grandchildren. What I want to do is spend more time on my own work.\\" In the beginning of his career, Regmi’s work was supported by the University of California at Berkeley through facilitation by Leo E Rose. The latter had come into contact with Regmi in 1957 when he had come to Nepal to do research on its diplomatic history. Berkeleys grant to Regmi in 1960 was processed through its Institute of International Studies and it allowed him to work on the magisterial four- volume study of land-tenure and taxation. These volumes were published by the Institute between 1963 and 1968. However this connection also brought some controversy for Regmi when it was revealed that the Institutes Himalayan Border Country Research Project through which Rose had channeled funds to him in the mid-1960s was funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the US Defense Department. This sinister university-government connection was discovered in India in 1968. The revelation led the Indian government to immediately terminate the Projects involvement in its Himalayan regions. When asked about this connection by Gaenszle in 1992, Regmi said, \\"I said: look, I dont know, I get paid for doing research on Nepal, I dont care where the money comes from….They gave me a grant, they never told me what to do. They said: You (can) do what you want to do. And I said I want to do land tenure and taxation in Nepal. It started with a one volume project, one became two, two became three, three became four. So they financed all that.\\" The Institutes grant for Regmi was discontinued in 1969 when the Himalayan borders project was scrapped. However Regmi continued to cherish his friendship with Rose long after this controversy and thanked him on numerous occasions in many of his books for the support given. The 1977 Ramon Magsaysay Award, granted to Regmi near the middle of his career as a historian, also came at a crucial juncture in his life. Apart from the international recognition which, as Regmi has acknowledged, \\"bolstered both his self-confidence and his credibility\\", the Award carried a grant of USD 20,000. This gave him enough economic security to continue with his research and publications, including his 1979 book Readings in Nepali Economic History and some of his periodicals. As Regmi told this writer, but for the Magsaysay Award, the Regmi Research Series would have been discontinued even earlier than 1989. The Legacy Although at times Regmi allowed certain historians such as Fr Ludwig F Stiller, (celebrated author of, among others, The Rise of the House of Gorkha (1973) and The Silent Cry: The People of Nepal, 1816-1839 (1976)) to make extensive use of his original document collection, it seems fair to say that Regmi was not particularly interested in reproducing his \\"school\\" of Nepali historiography. It is not clear whether he ever sought to mentor members from the next generation of Nepali historians, but it seemed clear that by the early 1990s, when this writer met him, he seemed little interested. Neither was he interested in socialising with other Nepali academics, some of whom he thought did not deserve the reputation they had garnered on the basis of pedestrian work. Regmi resisted most invitations to participate in other academic forums or seminars, and he rarely contributed articles to journals other than his own. As far as this writer knows, apart from an article published in Asian Survey in the early 1960s, and two articles published in Contributions to Nepalese Studies in 1975 and 1976, Regmi did not publish elsewhere, preferring instead to invest his energies in writing his books and producing his periodicals. Scholars (including this writer) who approached him for contributions often felt frustrated by his unwillingness to accede. In later years, it was also difficult to engage him in conversation, for Parkinsons disease had begun to take its toll. He would answer specific questions and then revert to recalling his past work and current obsessions. In a rare appearance in a 1990 seminar entitled \\"Kathmandu city and the Guthi system today\\", Regmi presented a paper highlighting the adverse impact on the civic life of Kathmandu resulting from the disappearance or institutional violations of this native mode of endowment-based philanthropy. But this presentation by the foremost scholar of the Guthi system began and ended with an apology. He stated, \\"The research has been inadequate and the presentation sketchy. The saving grace is that my aim in this paper has been to stimulate thought, not to present cut and dried solutions. If, therefore, the points I have made here provoke you to sit up and think on how we may be able to preserve and build on the initiative and liberality of our ancestors in using a portion of their wealth to construct and maintain temples, shrines, and other public assets in this city of ours, my efforts will not have gone waste.\\" Some of the obituaries published since his death have lamented the fact that the wealth of insights Regmi had produced in his research works had not been used by the Nepali state. But Regmi himself was much more modest about the use of his work for Nepals development. This he made clear in a short write-up in Himal in 1993 titled \\"Why I write Economic History\\": \\"I do not feel that there is any need for me to make an attempt to justify my research and writings on the economic history of Nepal in terms of their relevance to the mundane issues of economic development and political evolution. For me, far more inspiring and ennobling has been the feeling of participation, at whatsoever elementary level it may be, in the eternal quest for knowledge. In the course of exploring and recording a previously unknown and uncharted aspect of the history of the Nepali people and, therefore, of mankind as a whole, I have the feeling of having left my footprints on the sands of time. \\" Regmi could provide us with historical narratives of previously uncharted aspects of Nepal’s past precisely because he showed no interest in the gimmickry embedded in medals and national honours. His spiritual quest in academia was made possible in part by his fierce independence of mind and dedication, and in part by the fact that he could work in his modest study without the distractions provided by vacuous honours and recognitions.

He appointed himself as acting Lieutenant Governor of the Province until the governor appointed by William and Mary finally reached New York in March 1691. During this period, he had purchased land from Pelham Manor, reserving a portion to help create the Huguenot settlement of New Rochelle in 1689. He refused to turn over power to a newly appointed lieutenant governor in 1690. Leisler in 1691 was arrested and tried by his personal and political enemies on charges of felony and treason to William III and Mary II, for refusing to give up power to their appointed Lieutenant Governor before the full governor arrived several months later. He and his son-in-law were both executed. Many thought the trial was unjust. Four years later, Parliament reversed the conviction, clearing Leisler's name and restoring his estate to his heirs.

Based on his novel of the same name, the film was his directorial debut. The film won the Third Best Feature Film at the 12th National Film Awards in 1965. The film had no songs with the background score composed by Chitti Babu.  Plot  After being abandoned by her lover, Thangam, a construction worker, lives in a slum with her only son Chitti Babu. Chitti grows up as an irresponsible boy until he meets the owner of an ice cream factory. The owner preaches him the importance of one's mother and further provides him a job in his factory and gives him an admission to study in his night school. A reformed Chitti then takes up the burden of supporting his mother financially. During this time, an astrologer Manickam enters the slum and starts living there. Thangam gets fond of him and becomes pregnant with his child. Upon her insistence, Manickam joins her and starts living with the family. A good hearted Manickam shows fatherly affection towards Chitti, but Chitti who is possessive about his mother does not reciprocate his love for him. A mentally disturbed Chitti leaves home and stops going to work. Manickam understands the situation and leaves the house. Chitti on hearing this, returns home and starts living with his mother but remains indifferent. His behaviour affects Thangam emotionally. She soon gives birth to a baby girl and dies. It takes some time for Chitti to understand that he is an orphan and decides to take care of his sister.  Production  Unnaipol Oruvan was Jayakanthan's (pictured in 2012) directorial debut. Unnaipol Oruvan was a novel written by Jayakanthan, and serialised in the magazine Ananda Vikatan. Jayakanthan was encouraged by members of the Communist Party of India, with whom he was associated, to make a film based on his stories. Venus Krishnamurthy, a Tamil film distributor, had earlier informed Jayakanthan that he was ready to produce a film based on one of Jayakanthan's stories. Jayakanthan, on the encouragement of his friends and Communist party members, met Krishnamurthy and told his idea of making a film adaptation of Unnaipol Oruvan. Krishnamurthy was impressed with the novel and asked Jayakanthan to write the script. Jayakanthan completed the script in 10 days and showed it to Krishnamurthy, who after hearing the script, remarked that it resembled a typical Bengali film and did not have any entertaining aspects featuring in it. Jayakanthan and his friends took the criticism seriously and walked out. He formed a production company with his friends and named it Asiajothi Films. The film was made on a shoestring budget of 80,000–100,000. Principal photography of the film began on the Diwali day of 1964. Members of the Seva-stage troupe were signed up to play principal roles in the film. Filming was completed in 21 days. The film had no songs, and the background score was composed by Chitti Babu.  Release and reception  The film was censored on 30 December 1964 and sent for the 12th National Film Awards (1964). However, it got released only on 27 February 1965. Jayakanthan released the film himself as the distributors backed out citing there were no known actors in the film. It won the Third Best Feature Film at the National Film Awards ceremony. The film is widely considered by the critics as the first neorealistic film in Tamil cinema. It started a new wave and is seen as a trendsetter for realistic films in Tamil cinema. Despite receiving critical acclaim, the film was a failure at the box office. It was also screened at the Soviet Union. Politician K. Kamaraj appreciated the film, saying the Government must enable the public to watch this film freely so that the message of the film could reach out better and to larger audiences. French film critic Georges Sadoul praised it as a \\"neo-realistic masterpiece\\". As of September 2013, no print of the film is known to survive, making it a lost film. Ananda Vikatan, in a review dated 7 February 1965, wrote that Jayakanthan was bringing in a new wave with the film. The reviewer added that the realistic and new wave film would making everyone watch it at least once.

He was president of the American Psychiatric Association from 1921 to 1922, and proposed a progressive program in mental health in the United States. Biography Copp was born in Salem, New Hampshire, in 1858. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1881, and then from Harvard Medical School in 1884. In 1885, he was appointed assistant physician at Taunton State Hospital (formerly known as the State Lunatic Hospital at Taunton) in Massachusetts and later served as assistant superintendent for the hospital. In 1898, the Massachusetts Hospital for Epileptics was opened (later renamed the Monson State Hospital) in Palmer, Massachusetts, and Copp was appointed to direct the construction and remodeling of the hospital. The following year he was appointed executive officer of the new Massachusetts State Board of Insanity. In 1900, he proposed to the state legislators a program to take care of three kinds of patients: the acute and curable, the chronic, and those who would live in a colony-type setting. The Gardner State Colony for the Insane was opened in 1902 in Gardner, Massachusetts, and it pioneered the use of cottage residences for mental ill patients. In 1908, Copp proposed the need for a psychopathic hospital for scientific research, medical education, and outpatient services, and he advocated for the construction of a metropolitan- styled mental hospital for approximately 2,000 patients. In 1909, laboratory services in the state hospitals were increased and a state pathologist was appointed. In 1911, Copp left Massachusetts to become physician-in-chief and superintendent of the Department of Mental Diseases of the Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. He built and remodeled old buildings and hired new medical staff. From 1922 to 1929, he was relieved of his administrative responsibilities and became a full-time consultant on the building of a new institute. Copp was active in the revision of Pennsylvania mental health laws by advocating state involvement in mental hygiene and community mental health services. After his retirement in 1921, he remained a consultant for development at the Pennsylvania hospital. In his Presidential address to the American Psychiatric Association in 1921, Copp pointed out the needs for psychiatric and mental hygiene programs which would be appropriate into the twenty-first century. Many of his proposals have since been adopted by state legislatures. He died in Seville, Spain, in 1933.

The official website uses the English subtitle Passion Leads Army, albeit unofficially. () is a Chinese first-person shooter computer game. It is the first online, military-themed video game released by the People's Liberation Army (PLA). Development Glorious Mission was developed by Giant Interactive Group, a company which develops and operates a number of popular online games in China, including the ZT Online 1 Series, ZT Online 2, Elsword and Allods Online. The game took 32 months to develop. The goal of this game is to train people in combat skills and technological awareness. A non-public, military version was also developed by China's People's Liberation Army. The main story focuses on the conflict between Japan and China over a group of islands for which sovereignty is disputed, known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan and the Diaoyu Islands in China. The final version of the game was launched on June 20, 2011. An update that allows gameplay on the Diaoyu Islands was released on Armed Forces Day in China to coincide with the 86th anniversary of the formation of the People's Liberation Army. Background Glorious Mission has been used to recruit potential soldiers for the People's Liberation Army as well as to train and educate current PLA combat troops. Glorious Mission accurately recreates the details of firearms, uniforms, and vehicles used by the People's Liberation Army. The game has been criticized for trivializing the reality of war by presenting it as a video game. There are two versions of the game. The public release version supports online service and is free to play, but requires new players to register an account using their personal Resident Identity Card. The military version includes eight single-player campaigns and a multiplayer mode used by the People's Liberation Army for recreational use. The military version is also available for purchase through an activation code after a free download.2012-08-10, 全面革新 《光荣使命》军用升级版15日开售 , 腾讯游戏. Gameplay Glorious Mission is similar to popular American first-person shooter games such as the Call of Duty series, allowing players to make their way through basic training before being deployed in a number of combat missions. The game is divided into three parts: basic training, individual soldier tasks, and squad/team confrontation. Glorious Mission levels heavily feature scripted events, such as plane flyovers and explosions. The game often forces players on a fixed path without giving them freedom to approach situations tactically. In the first level, after a brief amphibious landing, players follow a somewhat direct line through narrow trenches. In another level, after some stationary sniping, players are pushed through a narrow cave. Other levels consist of players working their way up a fenced path. The public release version includes player versus player and Co-op modes. Co-op battles are designed to inspire patriotism in players, with missions such as \\"Dream to return to Shanghai\\" (梦回上海 meng hui shanghai) where players fight against the Imperial Japanese Army as PLA soldiers during the Battle of Shanghai,2013-04-15, 《光荣使命》中国梦 今日17时核爆开测 , Official Page. and \\"Protect the Diaoyu Islands\\" (保卫钓鱼岛 baowei Diaoyudao), which involves defending the Diaoyu Islands base from the Japan Self-Defense Forces. The JSDF appear as basic enemies in the Training Mode and Team Time Attack player versus environment modes. Reception The game was extremely popular in China. According to government statistics, it has over 300 million online players. In its first quarter, the online game market was worth 8.5 billion Yuan ($1.31 billion U.S.). A common complaint about the game is that players need to pay in order to download the game online. =Controversy= Russian media outlets have reported that the enemies in the game most closely resemble soldiers of the United States. In response, a Chinese Ministry of Defense spokesman stated that the game's development is not directed against any particular country, and suggested that the media should refrain from excessive speculation and interpretation.俄媒称中国游戏光荣使命中对手很像美国人 , NetEase See also *America's Army Footnotes References External links * Category:2013 video games Category:First-person shooters Category:Unreal Engine games Category:Video games developed in China Category:Propaganda video games Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ","title":"Glorious Mission"},{"id":"40136196","text":"Dull Center is an unincorporated community located in Converse County, Wyoming, United States.

He served as Lord Mayor of London for the year 1698 to 1699. The goldsmith's business which he built up from 1671 later became one of the first London banks, Child & Co. Early life Child was born in 1642, the son of Robert Child, clothier, of Headington in Wiltshire. He came to London at an early age, and was apprenticed in March 1656 to William Hall, a goldsmith of London, for a term of eight years, on the expiration of which he was admitted, 24 March 1664, to the freedom of the Goldsmiths' Company, and on 7 April 1664 to that of the city of London.  Goldsmiths and Child's Bank  The firm of Child & Co. takes its origin from a family of London goldsmiths named Wheeler. John Wheeler, who carried on his business in Chepe, died in 1575. His son, also named John, moved into Fleet Street, and died in 1609. After him William Wheeler, probably his son, moved from his old shop to the Marygold, hitherto a tavern, next door to Temple Bar. He had a son, likewise named William Wheeler, who was admitted a member of the Goldsmiths' Company by patrimony on 27 April 1666. Child married Elizabeth, sister of the younger William Wheeler, aged 19, on 2 October 1671. Her father, the elder William Wheeler, had died in 1663, and his widow married Robert Blanchard, who succeeded to the business at the Marygold, and took Child into partnership, probably about the time of his marriage in 1671. In the little London Directory of 1677, the names of 'Blanchard and Child at the Marygold' are found among the goldsmiths 'that keep running cashes.' On the death of Blanchard in 1681, Child inherited the bulk of his fortune, and also that of the Wheelers, and in July of the same year the firm became Francis Child and John Rogers. Child was the first banker who gave up the goldsmith's business, and he is called by Pennant 'the father of the profession.' Previous to 1690, the old ledgers of the firm were full of goldsmiths' and pawnbroking accounts mixed up with banking transactions. The sign of the marygold may still be seen in the water-mark of the present cheques, and the original sign is preserved in the front shop over the door which leads into the back premises. It is made of oak, the ground stained green, with a gilt border surrounding a marygold and sun, and the motto 'Ainsi mon ame.' Mr. J. G. Nichols, in the 'Herald and Genealogist' (iv. 508), gives an engraving of the sign. It was probably painted about 1670. The Devil tavern, which adjoined the Marygold in Fleet Street, was pulled down in 1787, having been purchased by Messrs. Child & Co. for £2,800, and in the following year the row of houses now known as Child's Place was built upon the site. The meetings of Ben Jonson's club had been held in the tavern, and among the relics of the club possessed by Messrs. Child & Co. are a board containing the rules of the club in gold letters, and the bust of Apollo which was formerly placed over the entrance door. Oliver Cromwell is said to have been a customer of the Wheelers, and in later times Nell Gwyn, Titus Oates, Archbishop Tenison, Barbara Villiers, duchess of Cleveland, and many other celebrated persons. For many years Messrs. Child & Co. were tenants of the chamber over Temple Bar, for which they paid the corporation £21 per annum, until the removal of the structure in 1878. They kept here their old ledgers and other books, which amounted in weight to several tons. It has been usual for the firm upon all state occasions to accommodate the lord mayor and corporation with the use of their premises while waiting for royalty at Temple Bar.  Politics  On 6 January 1681 Child was returned after a contest as a representative for St. Dunstan's precinct of the ward of Farringdon Without in the court of common council, one of his opponents being Mr. Taylor of the Devil tavern. It is stated in the 'London Gazette' of 3 December 1683 that the subscriptions towards the lottery of the late Prince Rupert's jewels, valued at £20,000, were paid in to Mr. Child at Temple Bar. The king himself is said to have taken a great interest in the matter, and personally counted the tickets at Whitehall. It is also stated that Child was appointed by the Bishop of London to receive the collection made in February 1682 for the restoration of St. Albans Aabhey. In October 1689, Child was elected alderman of the ward of Farringdon Without, and on the 29th of the same month he was knighted by William III at Guildhall at the mayoralty banquet. Child was a whig, and now acted as one of the leaders of that party in the corporation. He was admitted a member of the Hon. Artillery Company in February 1690. In 1690 the elections of mayor, sheriffs, and chamberlain were contested on strictly political grounds, the church party putting forward Sir W. Hedges and Thomas Cook for the shrievalty, who were opposed by Child and Sir Edward Clarke on behalf of the whigs. Child headed the poll by a narrow majority. In March 1694 he was elected by the court of lieutenancy to be one of the six colonels of the city trained bands. Child stood for Parliament at Devizes at the 1695 general election, but was defeated. He was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Devizes at the 1698 general election On 29 September 1698 he was elected lord mayor of London for the following year. His inauguration took place on 29 October, and the pageant, prepared for the occasion by Elkanah Settle at the expense of the Company of Goldsmiths, was published in folio, with plates, under the title Glory's Resurrection, be° the Triumphs of London revived, for the inauguration of the Right Honourable Sir Francis Child, Kt., Lord Mayor of the City of London, 1698. This pageant is now very scarce; a copy is preserved in the Guildhall Library. The procession is described in the London Gazette, and appears to have been of more than usual grandeur. The ambassadors who were in town went into the city to see the sight, and on the return from Westminster the civic barges stopped at Dorset Stairs, where the lord mayor and aldermen disembarked and were entertained by the Earl of Dorset. The procession afterwards landing at Blackfriars proceeded to Guildhall, accompanied by the lords justices, who were attended by the life guards and the horse grenadiers. Child is said by Luttrell (iv. 577) to have been 4,000l. out of pocket by the expenses of his year of office. The emoluments of the mayoralty at that time chiefly consisted of the money realised by the sale of such city offices as fell vacant during the year. During his mayoralty he took measures to regulate the price of corn, and appointed officers to attend daily at Queenhithe and post up the prices to prevent imposition upon the public. Child held the post of jeweller to the king, which he resigned in 1697, his successor being Sir Stephen Evans. Child's vast wealth enabled him to lend the government large sums of money. In August 1692, he joined Sir J. Herne and Sir S. Evans in an advance of £50,000 to the crown to meet the expenses of the government of Ireland. The forthcoming election of members of parliament for the City of London gave rise to an exciting struggle in December 1700. Child, who was now a member of the Tory party, stood unsuccessfully for London at the 1st general election of 1701, when the four Whig candidates carried the seats. However he was returned again at Devizes at that election and at the second general election in 1701. At the 1702 general election, Child was returned for both Devizes and the City of London, and chose to sit for London. He was master of the Goldsmiths' Company in 1702 At the 1705 general election Child decided not to stand for the City of London and was returned again for Devizes. Then at the 1708 general election he decided not to stand at Devizes, but was defeated at the City of London and left without a parliamentary seat. At the 1710 general election he stood at Devizes with Serjeant Webb but was caught up in a double return and was not seated until 16 December. He appears from the state papers to have been connected in 1711 with the receipt of the land tax for Wiltshire.  Later life and death  Child was a great benefactor to Christ's Hospital, and in 1705, while president, rebuilt the ward over the east cloister at his own cost. His portrait hangs in the hall of the hospital, and another portrait exists at Osterley Park, taken in 1699 in his lord mayor's robes. For many years he lived at Fulham, in a mansion called East End House, which he built for himself on the east side of Parson's Green. About 1711 he purchased the family seat of Osterley Park; but his son, Sir Robert Child, is said to have been the first of the family who lived there. Child died on 4 October 1713, and was buried in Fulham churchyard, where a monument was erected to his memory. Family Lady Child survived her husband a few years, and was also buried at Fulham, 27 February 1719–20. Child had twelve sons and three daughters, and was succeeded in the firm and also as alderman of Farringdon, by his sons Robert Child, and Francis Child, both of whom were afterwards knight. His daughter Elizabeth married Tyringham Backwell, son of Alderman Edward Backwell, the great goldsmith, who was ruined by the closing of the exchequer by Charles II in 1672. Two of the sons from this marriage, Barnaby and William, afterwards became partners in Childs' bank.

He was the head of the Krupp steel conglomerate beginning in the 1950s. He was credited with helping to lead the re- industrialization of the Ruhr Valley and rebuilding Germany into an industrial power. He gained acclaim for saving some 250 Jewish workers during World War II by declaring them to be essential workers at an oil facility in Poland. In 1973, for saving Jews, he received the Righteous Among the Nations title awarded by the Israeli Yad Vashem, the highest honor given to a non-Jew. Early years Beitz was born in 1913 in Zemmin, Hither Pomerania. He began his career as a banker at the \\"Pommersche Bank\\" in Stralsund and started to work for Shell Oil Company in Hamburg in 1938. World War II Beitz remained in the employ of Shell Oil when World War II began in 1939. Following Germany's invasion and occupation of Borysław in July 1941, Beitz was assigned to supervise the Carpathian Oil Company operating the Borysław oil fields in what is now Ukraine. Given the importance of the oil fields to the German war effort, Beitz was able to designate workers as essential to the war effort. The Borysław area had a large Jewish population, with many Jews holding positions as chemical engineers, laboratory assistants, mechanics, and laborers in the area's oil industry. After witnessing the \\"Invaliden-Aktion\\" in August 1942, an SS-led evacuation of a Jewish orphanage in Borysław, Beitz became determined to act to save local Jews. Having a position of importance, Beitz received advance word of Nazi actions against local Jews and provided warning to the Jewish community. He also had the opportunity to select suitable workers from Jews who were being held at transfer points for deportation to concentration camps. In August 1942, he \\"extricated 250 Jewish men and women from the transport train to the Belzec extermination camp by claiming them as 'professional workers.'\\" Beitz recalled, \\"I should have employed qualified personnel. Instead, I chose tailors, hairdressers and Talmudic scholars and gave them all cards as vital 'petroleum technicians.'\\" Together with his wife Else, Beitz also hid Jews in his home. He also issued and signed fake work permits to save other Jews from the death camps. In 1943, Beitz's efforts were nearly exposed after two Jewish girls were arrested on a train to Hungary with forged \\"Aryan\\" permits signed by Beitz. Beitz survived despite a Gestapo investigation into the incident, but he was drafted into the German army in March 1944. In total, Beitz has been credited with saving the lives of 800 Jews. Beitz later explained his motivation: \\"I saw how people were shot, how they were lined up in the night. My motives were not political; they were purely humane, moral motives.\\" In another interview, he explained: \\"It wasn't anti-Fascism, nor was it resistance. We saw from dawn to dusk, as close as could be, what was happening to Boryslav's Jews. When you see a mother holding her children being shot, while you yourself have children, your reaction has to be completely different.\\" For his efforts in saving Jewish workers, Beitz received Poland's highest civilian honor. In 1973, he was also honored by Yad Vashem, the Israeli Holocaust memorial, as a \\"Righteous Among the Nations\\", the organization's highest honor for non-Jews who saved Jews from the Holocaust. According to Yad Vashem, \\"The Jews that he rescued from deportation included many unqualified workers, often in poor physical condition, who could not, by any stretch of the imagination, be described as 'professionals' or indispensable to the oil industry.\\" Post-war business career After the war, Beitz became the head of Iduna, an insurance company. His innovative business methods and compensation brought him attention. In 1953, Alfried Krupp hired him to become chairman of the Krupp steel corporation. He remained with the company for 60 years and helped build it into a publicly traded conglomerate, merging the company in the 1990s to form ThyssenKrupp. Beitz has also been credited with helping to lead the re- industrialization of the Ruhr Valley where Krupp's operations were based. After Alfried Krupp's death in 1967, Beitz served as executor and persuaded the Krupp heirs to establish a charitable foundation known as the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation. The foundation still owns 25% of ThyssenKrupp. Beitz remained active in the foundation and led its effort to fund the creation of the Museum Folkwang in Essen. From 1972 to 1988, Beitz was a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and an honorary member until his death. From 1984 to 1988, he was an IOC vice president and executive board member. In 2000, he received the Leo-Baeck Award, the highest honor bestowed by the Central Council of Jews in Germany. In July 2013, Beitz died at age 99 at his holiday home on the island of Sylt off the northern coast of Germany. He is survived by his wife Else and three daughters. Following Beitz's death, Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress, called Beitz \\"one of the great Germans of the past century.\\" Honours From the article in the German Wikipedia =Decorations= *Commander with Star of the Order of Merit of the People's Republic of Poland (1974) *Honorary Ring of the city of Essen (1983) *Order of Merit of North Rhine-Westphalia (1986) *Grand Cross 1st Class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (1987; Grand Cross 2nd Class: 1979; Grand Officer's Cross: 1973; Commander's Cross: 1971) *Grand Decoration of Honour in Gold with Star for Services to the Republic of Austria (1990) *Order of Cultural Merit of the Republic of Korea (2001) *Order of Merit of Mecklenburg- Vorpommern (2012) =Awards= *\\"Righteous Among the Nations\\" at Yad Vashem (Israel) for the help to persecuted Jews in the Nazi period (1973) *Honorary doctorate from the Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University of Greifswald (1983) *Honorary senator of the Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University of Greifswald (1991) *Honorary doctorate from the Jagiellonian University in Cracow (1993) *Honorary citizen of the university and Hanseatic City of Greifswald (1995) *Honorary doctorate from the Weizmann Institute of Science (1996) *Josef Neuberger Medal, together with his wife Else Beitz (1997) *Honorary doctorate from the Ruhr University Bochum, because of his \\"ministry of science and education in the Ruhr area\\" (1999) *Leo Baeck Prize of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, together with his wife Else Beitz (1999) *Leibniz Medal of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences (2000) *Honorary citizen of the city of Kiel (2003) *Honorary citizen of the city of Bochum during the ceremony for the 40th birthday at the Ruhr University Bochum (2005) *Honorary senator of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina (since 2008, National Academy of Sciences) (2005) *Honorary citizen of the city of Essen (single award since 1949) naming the new road through the former Krupp factory premises at the new ThyssenKrupp Headquarters as Berthold Beitz Boulevard (2007) *Hall of Fame of German Sport (2008) *The Chair for Human Rights at Harvard University on the science campus of the Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-University of Greifswald is named the Berthold Beitz place after the chairman of the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen and Halbach named Foundation, which promotes university and city for years (2008) *Moses Mendelssohn Medal for the rescue of persecuted Jews (2010) *Honorary senator of the College of Jewish Studies in Heidelberg (2010) *State Prize of North Rhine-Westphalia with his wife Else Beitz (2011) *Lew Kopelew Prize (2012) *Emperor Leopold I Medal of the German Academy of Natural Scientists Leopoldina (2012) *Honorary citizen of the University of Duisburg-Essen *Honorary citizen of Gerlos, Tyrol References External links * Berthold Beitz at Yad Vashem website Category:1913 births Category:2013 deaths Category:People from the Province of Pomerania Category:German industrialists Category:International Olympic Committee members Category:German Righteous Among the Nations Category:Grand Crosses 1st class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany ","title":"Berthold Beitz"},{"id":"40136250","text":"Formica japonica is a species of ant in the genus Formica.

He led the party to defeat at the 1922 and 1925 federal elections. Charlton was born in Linton, Victoria, but as a child moved to Lambton, New South Wales. He left school at a young age to work in the coal mines, initially as a hurrier. Charlton became prominent in the trade union movement, and in 1903 was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for the Labor Party. He switched to federal parliament in 1910. Charlton was an anti-conscriptionist, and remained with Labor after the party split of 1916. He was elected party leader in early 1922, following the death of Frank Tudor. As Leader of the Opposition, Charlton increased Labor's vote in 1922 but suffered a backwards slide in 1925. He resigned as leader in early 1928, succeeded by James Scullin, and left politics later that year.  Early life  Little is recorded about Charlton's early life, as he grew up in a relatively unknown mining district. It is known, however, that Charlton was born on 15 March 1866 in Linton, Victoria, a small town near Ballarat that today has less than 500 residents. He was born to Matthew Charlton, an English miner from Durham, and Mabel (née Foard). In 1871, the five-year-old Charlton's father moved with his family to Lambton, a suburb of Newcastle, New South Wales. After primary education at Lambton Public School, Charlton began work at Lambton Colliery as a coal trapper; a children's-only job opening trapdoors for coal carts. When too old for the job, Charlton was given a job at the coal-face. At 23 he married Martha Rollings at nearby New Lambton.NSW Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages Search (accessed 10 March 2008)  Emerging interest in politics  In 1896 plans to reduce coal workers' wages led to strike action. Charlton supported the struggle against wage reductions, but the effort failed and, along with many other miners, he moved to the goldfields near Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. After two years there, Charlton returned to Lambton and became an official in the Colliery Employees' Federation, becoming treasurer in 1901. While occupying that position, Charlton also prepared arbitration cases. Battling for an improvement in mine workers' conditions, he attended a trade union congress in November 1902, at which he moved for nationalisation of the coal mining industry, believing it would \\"eliminate cut-throat competition between owners that depressed miners' wages and conditions\\". That idea was opposed as being too radical but a compromise was drawn up urging state governments to open and run their own coal mines, while affirming the ultimate desirability of full nationalisation.  State political career  Colleagues urged Charlton to stand for the state electoral district of Waratah, and on 5 December 1903 Charlton became the second member for the district in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. His representation of that district was short-lived, as the next year he transferred to Northumberland, replacing John Norton. Charlton became the unofficial spokesperson for the miners, speaking principally about mining matters in parliament. In 1909 a coal miners' strike struck New South Wales and Charlton was called upon by the Colliery Employees' Federation to represent it in front of a wage board. Charlton was unsuccessful in gaining better conditions for the miners but he did settle the dispute, talking to miners around the state and convincing them to return to work. He resigned from state politics and in 1910 Charlton wrested the federal Division of Hunter from the sitting Frank Liddell. Hunter has remained a safe Labor seat ever since.  Early federal career  Charlton shortly after his election to federal parliament Charlton was an immediate success with Andrew Fisher and was promoted to the temporary chairmanship of committees in the House in 1913, however Charlton threatened to resign in 1915 over a dispute in government delays in granting the committee increased powers. Fisher mollified him and in 1916 Charlton proved his loyalty to the new Labor leader Billy Hughes by voting for Hughes' conscription referendum bill, even though he was vehemently opposed to conscription and fought hard against it. However, Charlton seemed to accept the affirmative result of the referendum and again proved his loyalty to Hughes by defending him when he became the target of caucus criticism. Charlton attempted to deflect attacks made on Hughes to a party conference, but Hughes left the party before a decision could be made. The new Labor leader Frank Tudor was a weak leader in health and political prowess. The successor-designate was T. J. Ryan, who had resigned as premier of Queensland in 1919 to federal politics. In August 1920, both Tudor and Ryan were taken ill while two of the Hughes Government's most important bills were being debated (the Industrial Peace Bill and the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill). On 12 August, a special caucus meeting elected Charlton as acting leader in the House of Representatives; the party's deputy leader was Senator Albert Gardiner. Ryan died of pneumonia on 1 August 1921 after persistent ill health. On 29 September, the party elected Charlton as deputy leader in place of Ryan. Tudor died of heart disease on 10 January 1922, and Charlton became the de facto acting leader of the party. On 25 January, the party unanimously chose him as leader of the Labor Party in the House of Representatives, thus allowing him to become Leader of the Opposition. The overall leadership of the party remained vacant until 16 May, when Charlton won a ballot against Albert Gardiner (the party's sole senator). Gardiner was then chosen as his deputy.  Leader of the Opposition  At the 1922 federal election, Charlton offered alternative policies and looked to be favourite until he was hospitalised with illness halfway through the campaign. Labor still won the most seats as a single party, but Charlton was unable to defeat a strong government coalition. Labor remained in opposition. Because of great losses during World War I, Charlton opposed military training and commitments of Australian forces. In 1924 Charlton was invited to a League of Nations (now United Nations) conference in Geneva, Switzerland. At the conference Charlton strongly opposed war, and the Geneva Protocol took form. Upon his return to Australia, Charlton advocated adoption of the protocol, but the government sided with the British and refused to observe it. Charlton lost the 1925 election, largely due to his stance on industrial relations and continual militant union action which plagued his campaign. Charlton always aided in maintaining amicable relations in the party and many times lent his expertise to conflicts within the NSW branch of the Labor Party. He resigned from his positions on 29 March 1928. His successor James Scullin went on to become the Prime Minister of Australia.  Final years  Charlton in 1928 Following retirement from federal politics, Charlton took an interest in local government and became an alderman on the Lambton Council from 1934 to 1938 (before its merger with the City of Newcastle). He died at Lambton, New South Wales, on 8 December 1948, the place where he had grown up and lived most of his life. Charlton was buried in the general section of Sandgate Cemetery. Martha Charlton died on 8 June 1955 and is interred with him. Their sons Matthew and Percy predeceased both of them.NSW Register of Births, Deaths and Marriages – Death Record Search (accessed 10 March 2008) The Division of Charlton in the Hunter Region was named in his honour, and was a safe Labor seat from its creation in 1984 until its abolition in 2016.

The dispute was eventually resolved in August 2013 by a motion of no confidence in Prime Minister Willy Telavi, following which Enele Sopoaga was elected Prime Minister. Background Tuvalu is a parliamentary democracy. Queen Elizabeth II—as the Queen of Tuvalu—is the head of state, represented by the Governor- General, who is appointed (or removed) by the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is elected by the members of the Parliament but it is within the Governor-General's reserve powers to unilaterally dismiss him. The dispute began following the sudden death of the incumbent Member of Parliament for Nukufetau, Lotoala Metia, on 21 December 2012, resulting in both the government and opposition having seven representatives in Parliament. Despite protests from the opposition, the ministry of Prime Minister Willy Telavi delayed a by-election for the seat by more than six months, until June 2013, when the High Court of Tuvalu ordered that the by-election be held within 28 days of the judgment. The decision was delivered by Senior Magistrate Afele Kitiona on behalf of Chief Justice Sir Gordon Ward. The decision was delivered following two separate legal challenges by both the government and the opposition that sought to determine the minister who was responsible for allowing elections to take place. The ruling gave the opposition the necessary notices required to begin the by-election process in the constituency, which would allow them to gain a majority in parliament and, theoretically, pass a motion of no confidence in the government. Opposition member and lawyer Taukelina Finikaso said the following after the ruling: \\"We have certainly been working with our candidate and we are quietly confident we will be able to get through this by-election.\\" Crisis =By-election= The by-election was eventually held on 28 June 2013 and opposition member Elisala Pita beat the government candidate Petely Niuatui by 537 votes to 264, giving the opposition an 8–7 majority over the government in the Tuvaluan Parliament.\\"Tuvalu’s Opposition waiting to hear from GG\\" , Islands Business, 1 July 2013 The constitutional crisis continued as the Prime Minister announced that, under the Constitution of Tuvalu, he was only required to convene Parliament once a year, and was thus under no obligation to summon it until December 2013. Tuvalu's opposition then requested the Governor-General Sir Iakoba Italeli to intervene against the Prime Minister's decision. On 3 July, Italeli exercised his reserve powers in ordering Parliament to convene, against the Prime Minister's wishes, on 30 July. Opposition member Finikaso said: \\"It looks like we have seen the end of the uncertainty that reigned in Tuvalu for the last six months.\\" He continued by announcing that the opposition were planning to move a motion of no confidence in the incumbent prime minister and that they would put forward their candidate for the job. =Reconvening of Parliament= In an attempt to avoid a vote of no confidence, Prime Minister Willy Telavi tabled a motion to dissolve Parliament, but this was subsequently defeated by the opposition by 8 votes to 5. In a further twist, just minutes later, the government's Health Minister, Taom Tanukale, announced he was resigning his post, helping to dwindle government numbers further from five to four, following Education Minister Falesa Pitoi's absence due to illness. Opposition member Finikaso described how the resignation 'shocked' parliament. =Adjournment= Following the resignation of the Minister of Health, on 31 July 2013, the Speaker of the Tuvaluan Parliament Sir Kamuta Latasi announced he was adjourning Parliament for six weeks to allow for a by-election to take place in the Nui constituency. The adjournment led to further hostility from the opposition, who hoped to move a vote of no confidence in Telavi, claiming that the Speaker has failed to \\"listen to the advice of the Attorney-General\\". In response, Latasi claimed that the constitution does not allow for a vote if a constituency lacks representation, stating: > If he [Telavi] is removed from Parliament he [Telavi] is removed by a two- > thirds majority of the total membership. I have already acted on the advice > of the Governor-General. The Governor-General has ordered that Parliament > sit on the 30th of this month, which we sat yesterday. That order has been > carried out by the Speaker of Parliament. The Attorney-General told the opposition that despite the Health Minister's resignation, the motion of no confidence could still go ahead. The Speaker's response prompted the opposition to seek assistance from the Governor-General for a second time so that parliament could be reconvened once again. The opposition claimed that the prime minister had given no indication that he would call a by-election for Nui, which, in Tuvalu, the PM must do to allow an election to occur. =Dismissal of Willy Telavi= A day later, on 1 August 2013, Prime Minister Willy Telavi issued a public announcement where he informed the nation that he advised the Queen of Tuvalu, Elizabeth II, to remove Governor-General Itelali from his post. Responding to this, Governor- General Italeli, acting on behalf of the Queen sent out a proclamation dismissing Telavi as the Prime Minister of Tuvalu. The Queen chose to delay officially accepting the Prime Minister's advice, though she cannot reject it outright. Until then, the Governor-General was still incumbent: \\"Up until now I have not received anything from Telavi so I have decided to use my own powers and make the proclamation,\\" Italeli said. Minutes later, Opposition leader Enele Sopoaga was appointed as acting prime minister. Although advice from the Prime Minister to the Queen is binding, she does have to officially accept or assent in order for it to go into effect. The Governor-General's office source said that no decision from Elizabeth II had been made yet as to whether Itelali's removal by Telavi would be accepted, and thus, at the time of dismissing Telavi, Itelali remained the incumbent Governor-General of Tuvalu. It is suspected the Queen deliberately chose to take time before officially accepting the advice in order to allow Itelali to remove Telavi. Once Telavi was removed his pending advice to the Queen becomes moot, and Itelali remained Governor-General. Willy Telavi defended his actions in not calling the by-election or recalling Parliament, and placed the responsibility for the constitutional crisis with Sir Iakoba Italeli, the Governor-General, who he says intervened only five days after the by-election, \\"Though he got the power to do that, we are a small country where we can consult each other without resorting to this kind of exercising of powers\\". =Appointment of Enele Sopoaga= On Friday 2 August, Willy Tevali faced a motion of no confidence, the voting was eight for the motion, four against and one abstention - the Speaker abstained for voting on the motion. The Governor- General ordered parliament to meet once again on the following Saturday to elect a new prime minister, and a ballot held was won by the opposition leader by 8 votes to 5; following the vote Enele Sopoaga was sworn in as Tuvalu's new prime minister on 5 August 2013. He appointed his new cabinet to the Sopoaga Ministry the same day. A High Court challenged to Telavi's removal was considered,\\"New Tuvalu government waits on a legal decision\\", Radio New Zealand International, 6 August 2013 but never eventuated.

The building was constructed in 1875, renovated many times in its lifetime and also largely rebuilt in the 1920s. The building has been used for numerous functions before being finally converted to its current purpose between 2002 and 2005. In 2009, the Academy Music Group took a majority stake in the venue, rebranding it the O2 ABC. The venue is protected as a category C(S) listed building. In March 2009; the Academy Music Group became the major stockholder of the O2 ABC. On 15 June 2018, the building was severely damaged by a fire outbreak causing the main roof of the venue to collapse.https://www.scotsman.com/regions/glasgow- strathclyde/glasgow-school-of-art-fire-bands-cancel-gigs-at-o2-abc-after- horrific-blaze-1-4755624 The fire had started in the Mackintosh Building of the nearby Glasgow School of Art which had recently been undergoing construction work due to a fire that occurred on 23 May 2014. History =Building history= In November 1929 ABC opened its flagship cinema. The architect who designed the building was named: CJ McNair. As this was to be ABC's flagship cinema it also seated a total of 2,359 people. The cinema was a conversion from an older building. The building was originally built in 1875 as the Diorama. In 1878 it was renamed as the Panorama. 10 years from the building's creation; in 1885 the building was then completely transformed to become Hubners Ice Skating Palace. In 1888 the building was one of the first in Glasgow to have electricity, The next phase of the building's life was when it was renamed the Hippodrome. The building became the home of the then popular: \\"Hengler’s Circus\\". When the circus was not putting on shows the building was used once again for the purpose of showing films to the public. In 1927 the building reverted into the function it was originally built for, a dance hall. The building consisted of a ground floor car park while the second floor was the main dance hall. =Cinema= When the dancehall was renovated in 1929 the building retained the majority of its original architecture. the roof structure, the ground level of the building remained the car park while the dance floor became the stalls of the cinema. The ground level also had a small entrance area that consisted of 2 box-offices. The main entrance of the cinema was reached by the twin staircase; which is still there today, as well as the option of two lifts to use. The actual auditorium; which consisted of seats on ground level and above, with balconies overlooking the stage, seated a total of 2359 people. In 1967 the building was renamed to \\"ABC 1\\" as there was an extension added onto the building which was named \\"ABC 2\\"; The ABC 2 housed a much smaller 922 people. The ABC 2 was the first cinema to open in Scotland since World War II had ended. The building also contained a fully licensed bar. In 1979 the main building (ABC1) closed to undergo a renovation into a four-screen cinema. Each of these screens seated: 906, 306, 206 and 192 people. The renovated building opened its doors to the public on 13 December 1979. The four-screen building closed on 29 October 1998, while the other building closed on 12 October 1999. =Music venue= David McBride from Regular Music spotted a gap in the market for a music venue of this size in Glasgow. A major interior conversion project of the former ABC1 cinema building was started in 2002 and then in 2005 the fit-out was completed. In 2009, the Academy Music Group took a majority stake in the venue, rebranding it the O2 ABC. =Events= The building hosted regular events in the form of live music performances and nightclub parties. O2 ABC Glasgow turned into a nightclub venue for three events during the week names; Jellybaby, Propaganda and Love Music. =Damage= The building was extensively damaged by fire over the night of 15–16 June 2018.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow- west-44504659 The fire spread from the adjacent Glasgow School of Art.

The book hypothesizes that through the process of convergent evolution, people adopt a niche set of behaviors enabling them to cope with their particular social milieu in the same way as individual animal species adapt to their environments. The book has been translated into ten different languages, including Mandarin, Japanese, Czech, Hebrew and French, and has been featured on CNN, The Dr. Phil Show and CBS The Talk The Personality Test The Animal in You features a personality test of nine questions that collapses to one of 45 possible personality types. After readers answer the questions about their personality and physical attributes, the test returns a number corresponding to one of the 45 animal personality types, appearing in a look-up table. The underlying mechanisms for these types of tests are trivial for modern software based Internet tests, but this is the first known example of a book-based test able to resolve over 20 categories. The test is augmented by an interdependent weighting scheme wherein each question is assigned a different weight depending on how the other questions are answered.

The composition is instrumental except for the spoken line from drummer Nick Mason, \\"One of these days, I'm going to cut you into little pieces.\\" It features double-tracked bass guitars played by David Gilmour and Roger Waters, with each bass hard panned into one channel of stereo, but one bass sound is quite muted and dull. According to Gilmour, this is because that particular instrument had old strings on it, and the roadie they had sent to get new strings for it wandered off to see his girlfriend instead. Music Pink Floyd: Their Mortal Remains exhibition The predominant element of the piece is that of a bass guitar played through a delay (Binson Echorec) unit, set to produce repeats in quarter-note triplets. The result of this setting is: if the player plays simple quarter notes, the added echoes will produce a pattern of quarter note – eighth note, quarter note – eighth note. Pink Floyd would again use this technique on the bass line for \\"Sheep\\". The piece is in B minor, occasionally alternating with an A major chord. The distinctive keyboard accents on this track are composed of three components: A Hammond organ forms the 'fade in', followed by a \\"Stab\\" composed of a second Hammond organ with percussion stop, overdubbed with an acoustic piano fed through a Leslie speaker, as was also used on \\"Echoes\\". For live versions, the 'fade in' part was played on a Farfisa organ. The threatening lyric, a rare vocal contribution by Nick Mason, was recorded through a ring modulator and slowed down to create an eerie effect. It was aimed at Sir Jimmy Young, the then BBC Radio 1 and Radio 2 DJ who the band supposedly disliked because of his tendency to babble. During early 1970s concerts, they sometimes played a sound collage of clips from Young's radio show that was edited to sound completely nonsensical, thus figuratively \\"cutting him into little pieces\\".'One of These Days' section Echoes FAQ, Ver. 4.0, The Pink Floyd Fan Club.

According to John Peel, Waters has described \\"One of These Days\\" as a \\"poignant appraisal of the contemporary social situation\\".Meddler, The Pink Floyd RoIO Database. Gilmour has stated that he considers it the most collaborative piece ever produced by the group.

After being seen on television by the band, it was back-projected by Pink Floyd during live performances and Emes was commissioned to make further films for the band. It has since been released as an \\"extra\\" on the band's Pulse DVD. The tune also quotes Delia Derbyshire's realisation of Ron Grainer's Doctor Who theme music from the British science fiction television series Doctor Who. This quotation is most clear in live performances, particularly in concerts on the Momentary Lapse of Reason and Division Bell tours. Live performances The song was a concert staple on the band's 1971–1973 and 1987–1994 tours. The Live at Pompeii version was retitled as \\"One of These Days I'm Going to Cut You into Little Pieces\\", the full spoken threat. It was resurrected for the group's 1987–1989 A Momentary Lapse of Reason & Another Lapse tours and 1994's The Division Bell Tour, performed by David Gilmour on lap steel guitar, Tim Renwick on rhythm guitar, Guy Pratt on bass, Richard Wright and Jon Carin on keyboards, with Nick Mason and Gary Wallis on drums and percussion. It was included on the Delicate Sound of Thunder video (1989), CD, LP, and cassette (1988) and Pulse album (1995) (cassette & LP only) & video & DVD (1995/2006 respectively). It is absent from the iTunes version of the Pulse album. A live version was also included on the B-side of the \\"High Hopes/Keep Talking\\" double A-side single (1994). On 25 June 2016, David Gilmour and his solo band performed the song during their set at the Plac Wolności in Wrocław, Poland, the first time Gilmour had played it live in more than 20 years and the first time he’d ever made it part of a solo set list. Gilmour also performed the song during his concerts at the Amphitheatre of Pompeii on 7 and 8 July 2016. This performance was released as part of his Live at Pompeii live album. These concerts made One of These Days the only song played at Pink Floyd's 1971 performance and Gilmour's 2016 performance. Roger Waters plays the song in the first set of songs on his 2017 Us + Them Tour. The song also forms part of Nick Mason's Saucerful of Secrets show closing the main set. The performance again features Guy Pratt on bass. The song was played by Nick Mason's Saucerful of Secrets in 2018. A live version was released in 2016 on The Early Years 1965–1972, Volume 5: 1971: Reverber/ation, a live recording from a BBC radio session on 30 September 1971.

The falls has a height of almost 100 metres, and is sourced from the river Magnone, which runs beneath the valley of Ravizze and down to Lake Garda. Its waters are fed by underground leakage from Lake Tenno into the mountain that then forms the waterfall. The name Varone has its origin from the town of Varone a short distance away. La Cascata del Varone was opened to the public on 20 June 1874. Patrons were the King of Saxony and Prince Nicholas of Montenegro, who were near Riva del Garda on holiday.

It is an instrumental piece performed on an EMS synthesizer (Synthi AKS). It deals with the pressures of travel, which, according to Richard Wright, would often bring fear of death. Composition This piece was created by entering an 8-note sequence into a Synthi AKS synthesiser made by the British synthesiser manufacturer EMS and speeding it up, with an added white noise generator creating the hi-hat sound. The band then added backwards guitar parts, created by dragging a microphone stand down the fretboard, reversing the tape, and panning left to right. There are also other Synthi and VCS 3 synthesizer parts, made to sound like a vehicle passing, giving a Doppler effect. The 8 note sequence is played at a tempo of 165 BPM, while both filter frequency and resonance are modulated. Near the end, the only guitar part is heard: a chord over the explosion of the presumed aircraft, which gradually fades, segueing into the chiming clocks introduction of the following track \\"Time\\". When The Dark Side of the Moon was performed in 1972 (before the album was released), it went under the title \\"The Travel Sequence\\" and was, instead of a complex electronic instrumental, a more simple guitar jam, without the use of synthesizers and other electronic instruments. A short clip of this is played on the DVD Classic Albums: Pink Floyd – The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon and can also be heard on all performances of Pink Floyd playing the album live in that year. =Voices= * 27 seconds into the piece, the sound of a female voice on a loudspeaker can be heard; apparently an airport public address system. The announcer says, \\"Have your baggage and passport ready and then follow the green line to customs and immigration. BA 215 to Rome, Cairo and Lagos.\\" Engineer Alan Parsons later reused this sample on the Sea Lions in the Departure Lounge bonus track of the 2007 Deluxe Edition of Tales of Mystery and Imagination by the Alan Parsons Project. * At 1:54, Roger \\"The Hat\\" Manifold, Pink Floyd road manager says: \\"Live for today, gone tomorrow. That's me\\", then laughs. Reception In a contemporary review for The Dark Side of the Moon, Loyd Grossman of Rolling Stone described \\"On the Run\\" as a \\"standout with footsteps racing from side to side successfully eluding any number of odd malevolent rumbles and explosions only to be killed off by the clock's ticking that leads into \\"Time.\\" Live performances During the first official performance of Dark Side of the Moon, at the Rainbow Theatre on 17 February 1972, a version of this song was played with guitar, keyboard and drums instead of the synthesizer track that appeared on the album. Subsequent performances matched the album version and, at the end of the song, a model aeroplane would fly from one end of the arena to the other, appearing to crash in a brilliant explosion. The same effect was used in the A Momentary Lapse of Reason tour, but with a flying bed rather than an aeroplane. The Division Bell tour would reuse the aeroplane, only this time with the back of it in flames for additional effects. A live version of the song can be heard on the Delicate Sound of Thunder concert video, although it did not appear on the album release, however, it appears on the 2019 reissue and remixed version of the album. Another live version appears on the CD, vinyl, and DVD releases of Pulse. Roger Waters and his solo band performed this song live from 2006 to 2008 during his tour, The Dark Side of the Moon Live. The song was used by longtime public address announcers Tommy Edwards and Ray Clay of the Chicago Bulls organization during the Michael Jordan era as the theme for the visiting team at Bulls home games. This also marked the first use of songs of any kind in the live setting in the NBA.

To the left, the range officer with a timer that measures the shooter's stage time. Cowboy action shooting (CAS, also known as western action shooting, single action shooting, Cowboy 3 Gun, Western 3-gun) is a competitive shooting sport that originated in Southern California in the early 1980s, at the Raahauge Shooting Range in Norco, California. Cowboy action shooting is now practiced in many places with several sanctioning organizations including the Single Action Shooting Society (SASS), Western Action Shootists Association (WASA), and National Congress of Old West Shooters (NCOWS), Single Action Shooting Australia (SASA), Western 3-Gun as well as others in the U.S. and other countries. CAS is a type of multigun match utilizing a combination of handgun(s), rifle, and/or shotgun in a variety of \\"Old West-themed\\" courses of fire for time and accuracy. Participants must dress in appropriate theme or era \\"costume\\" as well as use gear and accessories as mandated by the respective sanctioning group rules.  Firearms  CAS requires competitors to use firearms typical of the mid-to-late 19th century: single-action revolvers, lever-action rifles chambered in pistol calibers, and side-by-side double- barreled shotguns (also referred to as Coach Guns – with or without external hammers, although automatic ejectors are not allowed), or pump-action shotguns with external hammers (similar to the Winchester 1897). Winchester 1887 lever- action shotguns and Colt Lightning slide-action rifles are also allowed in competition. Both original and reproduction guns are equally acceptable. All CAS handguns must be \\"single-action\\", meaning that the hammer must be manually cocked before each shot can be fired. Competition in a CAS match generally requires four guns: two revolvers, a shotgun, and a rifle chambered in a centerfire revolver caliber of a type in use prior to 1899. Some CAS matches also offer side events for single-shot \\"buffalo rifles\\", derringers, speed shotgun, and other specialty shooting. Replica firearms are available from companies such as Ruger, Colt, Uberti, Pedersoli, Stoeger, Chiappa, Pietta, Armi San Marco and U.S. Fire Arms Mfg. Co. = Wild Bunch matches = One variant of CAS currently sanctioned by SASS is The Wild Bunch Action Shooting, inspired by the 1969 Western film. According to SASS, this form uses \\"firearms typical of those used in the taming of the Old West just after the turn of the 20th century\\". The revolvers used in normal SASS events are replaced with 1911 pistols; lever-action rifles remain in use, while only 1897-style pump-action shotguns are allowed. As in traditional CAS, originals and replicas are acceptable. In SASS Wild Bunch matches, pistols must be chambered for .45 ACP, rifles must be chambered for pistol cartridges of .40 caliber or greater, and shotguns must be 12 gauge. All ammunition for pistols or rifles must also meet a minimum power factor of 150, calculated by multiplying the bullet weight in grains and the muzzle velocity in feet per second and then dividing the result by 1000. Additionally, maximum muzzle velocities are limited to 1000 ft/s for pistol ammunition and 1400 ft/s for rifle ammunition.  Costume  Competitors are required to wear an Old West or Victorian era style outfit and apparel. One exception to this is that safety glasses and hearing protection must be worn when shooting. Depending on the standards of the sanctioning organization, clothing may be historically accurate for the late 19th century or may just be suggestive of the Old West. Some groups allow for costume similar to that worn by characters in a western B-movie, such as Hopalong Cassidy or a television series like Gunsmoke. In SASS-sponsored Wild Bunch shooting, the required dress is military clothing of the early 20th century, Western clothing typical of that time (such as that worn in the film The Wild Bunch) or Mexican period dress.  Alias  Participants must select an alias out of the Old West or have an \\"old west flair\\". Aliases are registered with the sanctioning body so they are unique to the participant. Many find it necessary to be creative in selecting an alias (such as the banker who shoots under the alias \\"The Loan Arranger\\") as virtually all historical names such as Wyatt Earp and Butch Cassidy have long since been claimed. Registered names cannot sound the same as another registered name.  Competition  Props surrounding a CAS stage Steel targets down range at the stage. The shooter engages the targets with different weapons, using a rifle for the distant red targets, and revolvers for the closer blue targets. Competition involves a number of separate shooting scenarios known as \\"stages\\". Stages are always different, each typically requiring ten revolver rounds (shooters generally carry two single-action revolvers), nine or ten rifle rounds, and two to eight shotgun rounds. Targets typically are steel plates that ring when hit. Sometimes reactive targets such as steel knockdown plates or clay birds are used. Misses add five seconds to the competitor's time; safety violations and other procedural violations add 10 seconds. Competition is close and contested with the national and world championships attracting over 700 competitors. = Scoring = Shooters compete one at a time against the clock. Most matches are scored simply by \\"total time\\" minus bonuses and plus penalties. Other matches are scored by Rank Points. Shooters are timed using electronic timers which record the duration for each stage to one hundredth of a second. The timer starts when the Range Officer pushes the button which beeps to signal that the shooter may proceed. The timer has a built-in microphone and records the time when each loud noise (shot) happens. When there is no more noise, the timer continues to display the final time which is the raw score. Each shooter's \\"raw\\" time for the stage is increased by five seconds for each missed target and ten seconds for any procedural penalty incurred. The fastest adjusted time wins. Targets shot out of proper order incur a procedural penalty, though only one procedural penalty can be assessed per shooter per stage. In \\"Rank Point Scoring\\" the top shooter of a match is determined by adding up each shooter's ranking for each stage, with the lowest score winning. For example, if a shooter places first in every stage in a 10-stage match, the shooter's score would be 10 (a 1 for each stage) and would be the lowest score possible. There is some controversy as to whether \\"Rank Points\\" or \\"Total Time\\" is a better system. SASS in 2017 moved to Total Time scoring and discarded the Rank Point Scoring system. = Events = Every stage at a match is intended to be different. Sometimes only two types of guns are used or perhaps even only one. Occasionally a shooter is required to reload a firearm while being timed. When he comes to the line, the shooter will place his guns as required by the stage description. When the competitor steps to the start position, the Range Officer conducting the stage will ask if the shooter understands the course of fire and clarify any questions the shooter may have. The Range Officer will ask if the shooter is ready, will tell the shooter to \\"Stand By\\", and will start the timer within 2 to 5 seconds. When started, the timer gives an audible electronic tone and the shooter will begin the stage. An example of a stage might have the shooter draw his first revolver and engage five steel targets then holster his first revolver and move to his left to where his rifle is staged. He will retrieve his rifle and engage the rifle targets, which are set farther away than the pistol targets. These might be nine separate targets, or perhaps three targets which the shooter will \\"sweep\\" three times. He then lays his rifle back down on the hay bale with action open and chamber empty and runs to the right where his shotgun is staged. Since shotguns are always staged open and empty, the shooter will retrieve his gun and load it with a maximum of two rounds (regardless of the type of shotgun) and engage two knock-down targets, reload and engage two more knock-down targets (which must fall to score). The shooter will then lay his open and empty shotgun back on the hay bale and draw his second revolver. This time the shooter engages three revolver targets in what is known as a \\"Nevada Sweep\\" (left, center, right, center, left) for a total of five rounds. After the competitor is finished shooting, the Range Officer will tell him to take his long guns and go to the unloading table where another shooter will supervise the unloading and verify that the guns are unloaded. The shooter's time is then recorded and any misses or penalties added. Targets are scored by three observers who count misses. =Major matches= End of Trail – World Championship of Cowboy Action Shooting at Founders Ranch in Edgewood, New Mexico, United States of America (June) Winter Range – United States National Championship of Cowboy Action Shooting at Ben Avery Shooting Range, Phoenix, Arizona, United States of America (February) Eastern Divisional – Western Divisional – Currently held at Raahauges Shooting Range, Norco, CA (October) Regionals – Western, Four Corners, Midwest, Northwestern, Southwestern, Southeastern, and Northeastern State Championships – Each State holds their own State Championship.

Other major matches of note: Bordertown – Tombstone, Arizona Badlands Bar3 – Comin' Back At Cha https://www.sassnet.com/Downloads/SactioningMap-CURRENT.pdf = Safety = Foremost, safety glasses (shooting glasses) must be worn at all times. In a typical stage the shooter, who is next in line to compete, will load his guns at a loading table under the supervision of a designated loading official. Western-style \\"six-shooters\\" are always loaded with only five rounds with the empty chamber under the hammer. The shooter's rifle will also be loaded with the requisite number of rounds with the hammer down on an empty chamber. Shotguns are always left unloaded, then loaded \\"on the clock\\". At a typical Cowboy Action range, ALL guns are kept unloaded except when the shooter prepares at the loading table, shoots the stage, then proceeds to the unloading table to unload the revolvers and prove that all guns are empty. Whether guns are loaded or empty, CAS emphasizes safety. Even with the theme of the Wild West's cowboy attire, all shooters must wear safety glasses while on the firing line in addition to other important safety rules and more than some other shooting sports have. Many of these safety requirements are due to the nature of reproduction single action revolvers with fixed cylinders, and repeating rifles with non-removable tubular magazines. The Range Officer is responsible for safely conducting the shooter through the stage. The Range Officer's attention is not on the targets but rather on the shooter and his firearms. One important duty of the Range Officer is to immediately stop the shooter if the shooter's gun or ammunition is defective in any potentially unsafe way. = Themes = In addition to requiring shooters to wear Old West attire, the western theme of the matches is enhanced by having suitable targets and props for the stages. For example, a stage may be set in a bank and the shooter will be required to shoot through a barred \\"teller\\" window, then perhaps retrieve a \\"sack of gold\\" from a safe and carry it in one hand while shooting with his other hand. Another stage may have a shooter rescuing a baby (doll) and having to carry the \\"child\\" through the entire stage while engaging the targets.

There is generally no men's category per se, and women may shoot in the same category as the men. There are many other categories, especially at the local level, but the above are representative of the main types of categories one finds at cowboy action shooting events. In addition to percussion (cap and ball) weapons, many firearms are center-fire .32 caliber or larger with revolvers and rifles chambered in .38 Special and .45 Colt being very popular. Ammunition is generally loaded at medium to full power levels, although many junior shooters or women prefer to shoot lighter calibers (such as .32 and .38). A noted trend among some shooters is to use light loads to reduce recoil and improve their times. This tends to run contrary to the \\"Spirit of the Game\\".  Cowboy mounted shooting  An offshoot of cowboy action shooting is cowboy mounted shooting, also sometimes called western mounted shooting, or simply mounted shooting. Events require that the contestant ride a horse through a course of fire while carrying the same guns used in cowboy action shooting. The rider shoots up to ten balloon targets. Events use blank ammunition certified to break a target balloon within twenty feet instead of live rounds.

David Martin Murrayfield House, Edinburgh The monument to Lord Henderland, St Cuthberts, Edinburgh Life Born at Murrayfield House west of Edinburgh's Old Town on 11 May 1736, he was the son of Archibald Murray of Cringletie, an advocate. He studied law at the University of Edinburgh, and was called to the Scottish bar on 7 March 1758, and succeeded his father as sheriff-depute of Peebles in 1761, and as one of the commissaries of Edinburgh in 1765. He inherited the estate of Henderland in Dumfries and Galloway around 1760. On 24 May 1775 Murray was appointed solicitor-general for Scotland, and at the general election in September 1780 was returned to the House of Commons for Peeblesshire. The only speech he is recorded to have made in parliament was in opposition to Sir George Savile's motion relating to the petition of the delegated counties for a redress of grievances. Murray succeeded Henry Home, Lord Kames, as an ordinary lord of session and a commissioner of the court of justiciary, and took his seat on the bench with the title of Lord Henderland on 6 March 1783. He took part in the trials for sedition at Edinburgh in 1793, and died of cholera at Murrayfield on 16 March 1795. He is buried in St Cuthberts Churchyard in Edinburgh, beneath a huge monument, to the north side of the church. Recognition The district of Murrayfield takes the name of his family, as does the street name of Henderland Road within that district. Works Murray's Disputatio Juridica . . . de Divortiis et Repudiis was published in 1758 (Edinburgh). Family On 15 March 1773 he married Katherine Lindsay (1737-1828), daughter of Sir Alexander Lindsay, 3rd Baronet of Evelick, Perthshire. Their children included Sir John Archibald Murray, Lord Murray. Henderland was joint clerk of the pipe in the court of exchequer, an office which, through the influence of Lord Melville, was subsequently conferred on his two sons.

He was influential in the countercultural movement known as the Movida Madrileña, along with artists like Ouka Leele, Ceesepe, Guillermo Pérez Villalta, film director Pedro Almodóvar, singer Alaska, and photographer Alberto García-Alix. El Hortelano's style of painting evolved over time, and this evolution includes a distorted figurative period, a romantic period of orange tonalities, and, later, a period where lyricism and naturalism were emphasized. Considered one of the most important Spanish artists of his generation, he was awarded the Gold Medal for Merit in Fine Arts on November 3, 2010.  Early life  El Hortelano's father, José Morera Martínez, was a pharmacist and a keen painter and potter. His mother, Cándida Ortiz Ortiz, published seven books of poetry. Like his relative born a century earlier, Jaume Morera i Galícia, El Hortelano became a painter of nature. At the age of ten, El Hortelano fell ill with hepatitis, which was aggravated by brucellosis; and he was bedridden for a year and a half. From his bed, with his binoculars, he noticed a neighbor drawing in a nearby flat, and eventually got to meet him. The artist was Ambrós, the creator of Capitán Trueno, one of the characters in the comics published by Ediciones Vértice (Superman, Spiderman, The Incredible Hulk, El Jabato, etc.). Following the example of his comic heroes, he came up with a new name for himself, “Morera El Hortelano” (Morera the Gardener). In 1972, he quit university and traveled across Europe with fellow artist Roberto Jiménez. He read underground comics by his friends Mariscal, Nazario, the Farriol brothers, Montesol, and Max, keeping in contact with them even when they went to Barcelona to create the magazine El Rrollo enmascarado. Urged by Mariscal, he also published some drawings in the magazines Star, Ajoblanco, El Viejo Topo, and Triunfo. In 1973 the first exhibition of his work was held at Yes Gallery in Valencia.  Movida madrileña  At 21, El Hortelano was called for military service in Madrid. On his first Sunday leave, he headed to the Rastro flea market to meet the painter, Ceesepe, who had placed an advertisement in Star for his comic stall, the Cascorro Factory. El Hortelano soon struck up a friendship with Ceesepe, doing a series of covers for Star. He also made friends with Alberto García Alix, Montxo Algora, Miguel Ángel Arenas, Alaska, and other rising artists who used to meet at a bar called La Bobia. Ceesepe and he set up a studio not far away, and it soon became a focal point for the Movida. Painter and photographer Ouka Leele joined the group in 1976, and took her art name from a star in one of El Hortelano’s works. After a sojourn to Paris and London, they rented a flat with Ouka Leele. At night they found inspiration in bars such as El Pentagrama, La Vía Láctea, and the essential nightspot of the day, El Sol. 1977 also saw them put on group exhibitions at the Griffith, the Starless, and the Antonio Machado galleries in Madrid, and at El Ascensor in Barcelona. In 1978, they went to live in a tower of a small palace in Montjuïc, Barcelona, where they were able to meet up regularly with Mariscal, Broto, García Sevilla, Frederic Amat, and other Catalan artists. El Hortelano designed fabrics—one with strange traffic-light heads and another featuring figures with amusing and fantastically transformed faces, for the company Etamin.  Moda, Europa requiem, and Koloroa  In 1980, El Hortelano put on his first solo show entitled \\"Moda\\" (Fashion), where he displayed the 4-panel endpiece from his book of cartoons, Europa Requiem, which depicts the four seasons as seen in the subway. The exhibition brought together drawings and canvases featuring fanciful designs based on airline gear, flying costumes, and complex characters with bodies of televisions, telephones, plugs, light bulbs, spirals, and watches. It opened at the René Metrás Gallery in Barcelona in spectacular fashion. El Hortelano, sporting a sea-bass for a tie, was wheeled into the packed room on a hospital bed by Ouka Leele and a friend dressed as nurses, accompanied by a siren blaring from an ambulance they had hired. The spectacle made the newspapers the following day. The footage of the show was released later that year by the company Vídeospot in a 26-minute video entitled Koloroa. In the video El Hortelano and Ouka Leele take on the role of newsreaders. Koloroa received its première at the Fundació Joan Miró before being broadcast some time later on television on Paloma Chamorro’s program \\"La Edad de Oro\\" (The Golden Age). It was also aired at the Reina Sofía Museum and on television stations in New York, Japan, the Netherlands, and Germany. During these years, El Hortelano and Ouka Leele travel through Europe, the United Stats and Mexico and share with designers Montxo Algora and Javier Romero a loft in Tribeca, New York El Hortelano also took part in several group exhibitions in Barcelona and Madrid. The René Metrás Gallery show in 1982 also featured works by Ouka Leele, Mariscal, and Ceesepe. Mallorca-born painter Miquel Barceló, who had just arrived in Barcelona, also made an appearance. In 1982, El Hortelano moved, with Ouka Leele, to an attic in Calle Monte Esquinza, which opened new horizons in painting for him. He stressed the resemblance between the moon, clouds, buildings, and the everyday things that surround us. A cut nail or a slice of orange became a waning moon, an orange peel a spiral-shaped cloud, a hand a star, and an open book a building on the corner. The owners of the Moriarty Gallery played a vitally important role in introducing him to the art market. El Hortelano also appeared in two short films by Ceesepe (Buenaventura and El Bruto and Amor Apache). He also ventured into engravings, having been taught by Fernando Bellver at the studio Mayor 26. He completed a series of drawings called \\"La Estatua del Jardín Botánico\\" (The Statue in the Botanic Garden), based on the verses of one of Radio Futura’s most famous songs.  Notable series of works  = El Manifesto Emocionado (1984) = In 1984, El Hortelano suffered the loss of his father, two years after the death of his brother. His mourning can be seen in paintings that convey a sense of solitude and silence. The energetic characters who had occupied virtually all of the canvas had gone. He painted his brother's and father's absence, their unexpected disappearance. He left the jacket that kept them warm on the back of a chair, the shoes and the map used for travelling on a table, a half-peeled orange and others untouched representing a life cut short. He published two books of poems, writings and art, Manifiesto emocionado (Emotional Manifesto) and Quiero ser miércoles (I Want to be Wednesday). = El perdon de los pecados (1985-1990) = The 1985 painting \\"El misterio del mundo\\" (The Mystery of the World) represented a watershed in El Hortelano's artistic career—iconographically, formally, and chromatically. Optimism flooded a huge canvas—a bright, open space. The protagonist walks happily along without a care, but with intent. He looks upwards toward the sun/orange growing on a tree, not at the girl bending down, burying slices of orange, to reveal a heart carved in the bark of a tree by her side. This work is the first in a series entitled El perdón de los pecados (The Forgiveness of Sins), a collection of paintings in intense, flaming yellows, oranges, and reds, featuring strings and belts criss-crossing the canvas. In 1986, he came up with a similar design for the cover of Gabinete Caligari’s record \\"Al calor del amor en un bar\\". At the end of the year, the magazine Diario 16 devoted an eight-page supplement to him, including drawings and articles on the senses, commissioned by José Miguel Ullán, and entitled \\"El planeta humano\\". Meanwhile, the Madrid scene had defined and consolidated its position as an artistic movement, and El Hortelano took part in a large exhibition held in A Coruña. He was invited to join Sicilia, Cristina Iglesias, Juan Muñoz, and Javier de Juan in an exhibition, at the Menéndez Pelayo International University in Santander, called \\"Nuevos creadores\\" (New Creators). Shortly afterwards, he was awarded a visual arts grant by the Hispano-American Committee allowing him to live and work in New York. Ceesepe also came to New York and the two of them rented an old fabric loft in Tribeca. = Pater Noster (1990-1994) = El Hortelano was awarded a painting grant by the Spanish Academy of History, Archaeology and Fine Arts, in Rome, for the 1990-1991 academic year. He started painting what seemed like frescoes—with the ochres of the Roman walls and the reds of Pompeii—which featured classical architecture, the Golden Section, and Latin texts. He embarked on the series Pater Noster, a project to which he would dedicate four years and twelve large canvases, one for each of the sentences in the Lord’s Prayer. = Savitaipale (1995) = While in Rome El Hortelano fell in love with Sanna Kohonen, also a painter. At the end of his stay at the Academy, he went to Finland with her to spend three months in Savitaipale, a town in the south, near the Russian border. He used the town's name as the title for a series of works on handmade paper in which the protagonists are ants, leaves and drops of water. As a technical experiment, he immersed painted paper in the lake near the log cabin where he lived, researching how to paint natural phenomena. In 1991 he returned to Madrid with Kohonen. After two years in the center of Madrid, he moved to a house in Las Rozas, a village in the hills north of the city. There he completed Pater Noster and exhibited it, in 1994, at the Bárcena Gallery. He stayed in Las Rozas for five years, mostly on his own, as Kohonen decided to return to Finland permanently. He worked with Ceesepe and Mariscal on the illustrations for a book by musician Kiko Veneno, Cantos inoxidables de nuestra tierra. His design for the sleeve of the Radio Futura album Tierra features a man lying on the ground gazing at a starry sky and an ant climbing the walls of a huge ants’ nest. = Osa Mayor (1996-2004) = In 1996 El Hortelano started a new series, Osa Mayor (Ursa Major or The Big Dipper). In the eleven works of the first series that he completed in 1997, branches of trees sporting snails, transparent drops of water, and resin cross a night sky with shooting stars and tiny comets. The second series comprised seven large canvases—each one named after a star in the Big Dipper constellation—with lyrical images depicting a solitary man and diminutive creatures juxtaposed against the immensity of the universe. He used this composition in a poster for the 1997 Madrid Carnival, in which a smiling couple surrounded by masks contemplate a brilliant-blue dusk sky lit by the constellation, as symbolized in the city’s coat of arms. He also designed an Osa Mayor watch for Watch-Celona.  Red Sea paintings  In 1998 accompanied by painter Darío Álvarez Basso, he went to India, Nepal, and Jordan. The visit to the Red Sea on a segment of the aforementioned voyage inspired a series of canvases where thousands of marine creatures dart in and out of the coral. He experimented with transparencies, superimposing several layers of glazes, varnishes, and resins to create the sensation of an aquatic and crystalline mass, where marine life share the transparency of the rock and coral.  Madre Universo  El Hortelano returned to Madrid, at the end of 1998, and moved into a flat opposite El Retiro Park. In 2000, he designed one of the floats in the procession of the Three Wise Men on the Twelfth Night, for the Madrid City Council, Named \\"Madre Universo\\" (Mother Universe), the float featured moving planets—represented by friends wearing costumes—surrounded by dozens of children dressed as stars. In 2001 he was given a retrospective at the Conde Duque Cultural Center in Madrid and at the Reales Atarazanas in Valencia. He took part in a number of group exhibitions, including Art Oriented, From Spain to Korea: the World Cup in Japan/Korea at the Casa de España in Ulsan (Korea), in 2002, and also the annual international Flecha Contemporary Art Fair. = Madre Agua (2004-2008) = The series called Madre Agua (Mother Water) is described as an ode to the beauty of water and its beneficent activity. The artist presents, as if seen through a microscope, the microcosm that lives in the water or near it. = Humano (unfinished) = In addition to large-scale paintings on the seasons of the year, at the time of his death El Hortelano was working on a series called Humano (Human), one hundred miniature works in which he wanted to pay tribute to the human being and to the hand (Spanish: mano).

She became famous for her stage performances in the 1880s and 1890s.Will Rogers, Steven K. Gragert, M. Jane Johansson. (2005). The Papers of Will Rogers. University of Oklahoma Press. p. 110. Through her career, Fay was exposed as a fraudulent medium.Kerry Segrave. (2007). Women Swindlers in America, 1860-1920. McFarland & Company. p. 14. Fay was known for employing assistants including several who would dig up information about séance sitters in the towns that she visited.Maurice Zolotow. (1952). It Takes All Kinds. Random House. p. 60 In the early 1870s the American stage mentalist Washington Irving Bishop was the manager of Fay's spiritualist acts, but in 1876 exposed her trick methods to the media.Simon During. (2004). Modern Enchantments: The Cultural Power of Secular Magic. Harvard University Press. p. 161. In 1883 the ex-medium John W. Truesdell revealed her method of freeing her hands from cotton bandages.John W. Truesdell. (1883).

Massimo Polidoro. (2003). Secrets of the Psychics: Investigating Paranormal Claims. Prometheus Books. p. 103. \\"Her son, John T. Fay, married Anna Norman, one of the assistants in Eva's show, then left home and set up on his own with his wife, calling themselves \\"The Fays.\\" When John died in 1908, his widow set up her own show and billed herself as \\"Mrs. Eva Fay, The High Priestess of Mysticism.\\" Obviously, Annie resented her using a stage name so similar to her own, but never took legal action to stop her.\\" Fay applied for a membership to The Magic Circle and in 1913 during a tour in Britain, she was elected the first Honorary Lady Associate of The Magic Circle in London.Milbourne Christopher. (1975). Mediums, Mystics & the Occult. Thomas Y. Crowell. p. 178. Fay died on May 20, 1927. She is buried at Wyoming Cemetery in Melrose Massachusetts. In 1942, Harry Price of the National Laboratory of Psychical Research exposed the 'mechanical stool' trick of Fay.Harry Price. (1942). Search for Truth: My Life for Psychical Research. Collins. p. 48Paul Tabori. (1966). Harry Price: The Biography of a Ghosthunter. Living Books. p. 36. \\"He described the simple yet ingenious mechanism of the Anna Eva Fay mechanical stool, which had an automatic catch to release the right arm of the medium, enabling anyone to produce a large variety of phenomena— provided the sitters were gullible enough.\\" Crookes experiment In a series of experiments in London at the house of William Crookes in February 1875, Fay managed to fool Crookes into believing she had genuine psychic powers.Massimo Polidoro. (2000). Anna Eva Fay: The Mentalist Who Baffled Sir William Crookes. Skeptical Inquirer 24: 36-38. Crookes had Fay hold two electrodes in an electrical circuit connected with a galvanometer in an adjoining room. Movement of objects occurred in the room and a music instrument was played. Crookes was convinced that the electrical control had not been broken. Psychical researchers pointed out that Fay could have used other parts of her body or a resistance coil to maintain the electric current intact whilst her hands could be free to produce the phenomena during the experiment.Sherrie Lynne Lyons. (2010). Species, Serpents, Spirits, and Skulls: Science at the Margins in the Victorian Age. State University of New York Press. p. 101. Frank Podmore described the experiment in detail.Frank Podmore. (1897). Studies in Psychical Research. G. P. Putnam's Sons. p. 62. \\"In February, 1875, Mr. Crookes, assisted by Dr. Huggins and others, held a séance with another medium, Mrs. Fay. The medium was seated in Mr. Crookes library, and her hands grasped two wires attached to a battery, her body being this made to complete an electric circuit. A galvanometer, which flashed light on to a graduated scale, was placed in the adjoining room, in a position where the scale was clearly visible to the circle of experimenters. Under these conditions, whilst the light remained steady on the scale, showing, that the resistance was practically uniform, a bell was rung and a musical box was wound up in the library; a hand was shown at the curtain which hung over the doorway; and a book and a library ladder were pushed through the opening. Finally there was a slight noise, the circuit was broken, and the medium was discovered in a fainting condition.\\" Fay used magic tricks to accomplish her mediumship feats. She confessed in 1913 to Eric Dingwall that she had duped Crookes and other scientists.William Hodson Brock. (2008). William Crookes (1832-1919) and the Commercialization of Science. Ashgate. p. 199. She was investigated by the magician Harry Houdini, to whom after her retirement in 1924 she confessed fraud and revealed the tricks that she had used.Burton Gates Brown. (1972). Spiritualism in Nineteenth-Century America. Boston University. p. 231 Fay told Houdini the trick she had used on the Crookes galvanometer test: she gripped one handle of the battery beneath her knee joint, keeping the circuit unbroken, leaving one hand free.Massimo Polidoro. (2001). Final Séance: The Strange Friendship Between Houdini and Conan Doyle. Prometheus Books. p. 177. \\"She told him how she had tricked Crookes at the electric test: she had simply gripped one handle of the battery beneath her knee joint, keeping the circuit unbroken but leaving one hand free. Annie Eva Fay's revelation to Houdini of the way she had gulled Crookes was confirmed years later when psychical researcher Colin Brookes-Smith found at the Science Museum in London one of the galvanometers used by Crookes. The machine was repaired and brought to working order. Brookes-Smith reports that \\"there was no difficulty at all in sliding one wrist and forearm along over one handle and grasping the other handle, thereby keeping the circuit closed through the forearm, and then releasing the other hand without producing any large movement of the galvanometer spot.\\" Magic historian Barry Wiley suggested that Fay had beaten the galvanometer tests by working with a secret accomplice Charles Henry Gimingham (1853–90), an assistant of Crookes who had built the experimental apparatus.Barry H.

On July 22, 2013, the Boeing 737 operating the route suffered a front landing gear collapse while landing at LaGuardia Airport, injuring 9 people on board. The aircraft, which was worth an estimated $15.5 million at the time, was written off and scrapped as a result of the accident. Accident NTSB file photo, showing the extent of the damage to the electronics bay, with the collapsed nose gear jammed into it, only the right axle attached The aircraft landed on runway 4 with its nose landing gear touching down prior to the main landing gear. The aircraft's nose gear collapsed upward into the body of the aircraft, causing substantial damage to the avionics electronics bay in the fuselage. The aircraft slid on its nose along the runway, arresting off to the right of the runway pavement. The plane came to a stop halfway down the runway after skidding on its nose in a sea of sparks. As a result of the crash, the two-runway airport was closed until its rescue assets were available again. Two hours later, the airport's other runway reopened for traffic. The airport cleared and inspected the affected runway, and removed the aircraft in time for the earliest next day departures. Nine occupants were treated for minor injuries, all sustained during evacuation, six of whom were taken to local hospitals. Aircraft and crew The aircraft (built in 2000) was a 13-year- old Boeing 737-700, registration number N753SW, owned and operated by Southwest Airlines. Flight 345's captain had flown for Southwest Airlines for nearly 13 years, six years in the rank as captain. At the time of the accident, she had a total of 12,000 hours of flight time, including 2,600 flight hours as captain of a Boeing 737. The first officer had 20 years of prior experience in the United States Air Force and had been hired by Southwest Airlines a year and a half before the accident.  Investigation  On July 26, 2013, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) issued a press release disclosing its initial findings, which included: * The cockpit voice recorder recorded 2 hours of good data, including the full duration of the last flight from Nashville to New York City. * The flight data recorder provided 27 hours of data, including all parameters for the last flight from Nashville to New York City. * From the flight data recorder download: ** The flaps were changed from 30 degrees to 40 degrees 56 seconds before touchdown. ** The aircraft flared reaching 134 Knots Indicated Airspeed (KIAS) and an attitude of 2 degrees nose-up at above ground level (AGL), then 4 seconds later dropped the nose to 3 degrees nose-down at 133 KIAS at touchdown. ** The aircraft came to rest 19 seconds after touchdown. *Both the obtained flight data and the available video record have the nose gear making contact with the ground before the main landing gear did, which is the opposite order from the normal landing sequence. No mechanical malfunctions were found, but the nose landing gear collapsed due to stress overload. The NTSB's investigation became focused on the behavior of the flight crew during Flight 345's approach into LaGuardia Airport. The NTSB discovered that Flight 345's captain had been the subject of multiple complaints by first officers who had flown with her. Southwest's flight operations manual requires its pilots to abort a landing if the plane is not properly configured by the time it descends to . Analyzing flight recorder data, the NTSB determined that the captain had changed the airplane's flaps from 30 degrees to 40 degrees at an altitude of only . At , the captain observed that the plane was still above the glide slope, and ordered the first officer to \\"get down\\" instead of aborting the landing. At an altitude of only and 3 seconds from touching down, the captain took control of the aircraft from the first officer. The plane was descending at in a nose- down position when its nose wheel struck the runway. The NTSB ultimately concluded that the crash was due to pilot error. Specifically, the NTSB faulted the captain for failing to take control of the aircraft or abort the landing earlier, noting that the captain had warnings at (due to the flaps misconfiguration) and at (when the captain observed the plane was above the glide slope) and could have aborted the landing at that time. The NTSB determined that the captain's failure to take control until the plane had descended to only \\"did not allow her adequate time to correct the airplane's deteriorating energy state and prevent the nose landing gear from striking the runway.\\" Aftermath On October 2, 2013, Southwest Airlines announced that it had fired Flight 345's captain. The airline also announced that it was requiring Flight 345's first officer to undergo additional training. Neither pilot was publicly identified by the airline. The Boeing 737 involved in the accident, worth an estimated $15.5 million at the time, was found to be too extensively damaged to be repaired and was written off as a total loss. The aircraft was ultimately removed from LaGuardia Airport via barge to the Port of Albany (New York) in November 2013, where the airframe was broken up by a salvage dealer at the Port of Albany in March 2014, with some parts trucked to Owego for final destruction. The accident represents the third hull loss of a Boeing 737-700.

A daughter of Mamia I Gurieli, Prince of Guria, she married Levan c. 1520 and bore him at least two sons, including the future Alexander II. She divorced Levan at her own will and retired to the Shuamta monastery, which she had built in Kakheti.  Family background and marriage  Born of the Gurieli, one of the leading princely families of western Georgia with marital ties to the Trapezuntine Komnenos dynasty, Tinatin was a daughter of Mamia I, Prince of Guria. She had a brother, Rostom, subsequently Mamia's successor to the throne of Guria. Around 1520, King Levan of Kakheti, who had recently recovered his father's kingdom in eastern Georgia from the occupation by his cousin, David X of Kartli, and was then besieged by David's army in a fortress at Maghrani, clandestinely dispatched emissaries to Mamia with the request that he send military aid and also his daughter in marriage to cement the alliance. The prince of Guria promised both. Levan succeeded in defeating David's superior force with his own army at Magharo in 1520, while Mamia victoriously advanced into Kartli. The three rulers eventually met for negotiations at Mukhrani and Mamia persuaded both David and Levan to make peace. Thereafter, Levan send his men to bring his bride from Guria. As the 18th-century Georgian chronicler Prince Vakhushti relates, Tinatin had a dream foretelling that a noble man would take her as his wife and she would see, on her way to the groom's home, a white dogwood tree on a hill, a place where she was told to build a monastery in honor of the Mother of the God. Once brought in Kakheti, Tinatin saw the dogwood from her dream at Shuamta, vowed to build a monastery there, and proceeded to celebrate her wedding with King Levan at Gremi. The union produced at least two sons, Alexander and Jesse. Tinatin may also have been the mother of Levan's two other sons, Giorgi and Nikoloz, the future catholicos of the Georgian Orthodox Church.  Divorce and later life  left Levan was, in the words of the Georgian chronicles, \\"a lover of whoring and fornication\\". His subjects, whom Levan's reign brought relative peace and prosperity, were inclined to overlook his frailties. Tinatin was not, however. She requested and was granted a divorce in 1529. The queen retired to the Shuamta nunnery, built at her behest and on her dowry. The monastery came to be known as Akhali Shuamta, that is, \\"the new Shuamta\\", in contrast to Dzveli Shuamta, \\"the old Shuamta\\", a nearby located medieval convent, which had been abandoned by Tinatin's time. The monastery, which the queen built, has been functional into the 21st century, except for the hiatus of the Soviet rule. After the divorce, Levan married a daughter of the shamkhal of Tarku. Incensed at Tinatin's decision, he further disowned her children and favored his offspring of his second marriage, giving rise to a family feud after his death in 1574. His son by Tinatin, Alexander II, eventually emerged victorious. Tinatin continued to live at the Shuamta convent until her death there in 1591. She was buried in that monastery, far from her ex-husband, as she had requested.  Coat of arms  The coat of arms on Tinatin's gravestone in Shuamta. Tinatin's gravestone at the Akhali Shuamta church depicts a heraldic design carved on it, the earliest surviving representation of the coat of arms of the Bagrationi dynasty, to which her husband belonged. The coat of arms consists of a rectangular shield (escutcheon) which contains a smaller octagonal shield (inescutcheon), depicting the Seamless robe of Jesus, a sacred relic of the Georgian Orthodox Church, and supported by two lions rampant and surmounted by a royal crown, beneath which there are crossed royal scepter and sword. A harp and a sling n the left upper and right upper quarters of the shield, respectively, allude to the Bagrationi's claim of descent from the biblical king David. The scales in the left lower quarter symbolize the justice of Solomon, David's son. The detail in the right lower quarter is unrecognizable, but it could have been a royal orb. Surrounding the armorial achievement are the verses inscribed in the medieval Georgian asomtavruli script: \\"The Lord hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of the body will I set upon the throne\\" (Psalm 132: 11) and \\"the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout\\" (John 19.23).

It was eventually released in North America for Club Nintendo members on February 10, 2015; in Europe and Australia however, those who pre-registered or signed up for a Nintendo Account between March 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016 were able to redeem the app free via My Nintendo. It was again put on My Nintendo on December 1, 2016 for the Americas region and on January 1, 2017 for the PAL region, is available indefinitely where users can redeem it anytime for 200 points. On September 8, 2017, Nintendo announced that the Flipnote Gallery: World service would be discontinued in Japan on April 2, 2018, while ticket sales ended on October 2, 2017. Features =Flipnote creation= The main screen of the Flipnote creation interface. Largely similar to its predecessor, Flipnote Studio 3D allows users to create short animated sketches known as Flipnotes. Flipnotes can be made up of hundreds of frames, and can be played back at a variety of speeds. The software offers users the option to create 3D Flipnotes by drawing different parts of the animation on up to 3 layers. The main tools include a pen, an eraser, and a paintbrush. New to Flipnotes Studio 3D are tools that draw shapes, fill enclosed areas (paint bucket), and insert text. The application features a limited color palette, including black, white, red, blue, green, and yellow. This is a slight improvement upon Flipnote Studio, which didn't include yellow and green as selectable colors, but were still possible using color mixing. The selection tool is used to copy and manipulate parts of a frame. Users can also use the 3DS system's camera and microphone to add audio and photos to their creations. These animations can be shared by exporting them as GIF or AVI files. =Online services= Flipnote Studio 3D was launched along with two separate online services: Flipnote Gallery: Friends and Flipnote Gallery: World. As the names imply, the former allows for Flipnotes to be shared with people on the user's 3DS Friends List, and the latter is a worldwide community for sharing and viewing Flipnotes. Flipnote Gallery: Friends was a SpotPass service included as a part of Flipnote Studio 3D. The service allowed users to share Flipnotes with up to 20 people in their 3DS Friends List via temporary galleries.http://flipnotestudio3d.nintendo.com/ Flipnote Studio 3D for Nintendo 3DS: Official Site. Retrieved October 4, 2013. In addition, Flipnote Gallery: Friends featured a simple voting system. On November 1, 2013, Nintendo ended the Flipnote Gallery: Friends service in Japan, due to concerns that users, including minors, could exchange Friend Codes on internet forums and use them to send inappropriate content. Later, the Flipnote Gallery: Friends feature was removed completely from the application via an update. Flipnote Gallery: World's \\"Most Popular\\" page. Flipnote Gallery: World was a paid community service, and the successor to Flipnote Hatena. The service was based around 30-day \\"passes\\" that could be obtained in a variety of ways. There was also a window of time from between 3 pm to 7 pm when anyone could connect to the service free, based on the console's system time. Users received one pass when they first connected to Flipnote Gallery: World as a free trial to the service, with additional passes being purchased for a small fee of ¥100. Each pass, activated when the previous pass expires, granted users 100 Coins and 3 Star Coins which were required for various activities. A coin was required to perform most activities on Flipnote Gallery: World, including posting a comment or downloading a Flipnote. They were also used to rate Flipnotes. They also were required for posting Flipnotes. Users could add as many coins as they wanted, based on how much they liked the Flipnote. Users were given a very limited quantity of Star Coins. These were required to add another Creator to a user's Favorites, and could also be added to others' Flipnotes. Flipnotes could be posted using either a regular Coin or a Star Coin. If Flipnotes posted using a regular Coin did not receive any Coins within 30 days, they would be automatically removed from the service. On the other hand, Flipnotes posted using Star Coins would remain on the Gallery indefinitely regardless of whether they received any Coins. There was also a section of Flipnote Gallery: World called Nintendo DSi Gallery, wherein Flipnotes transferred from Flipnote Hatena could be viewed and downloaded. This gallery was free to access. Users could participate in the Flipnote Gallery: World community as either a \\"Creator\\" or a \\"Collector.\\" Creators made Flipnotes and posted them to the gallery, while the role of Collectors was to find high-quality Flipnotes and help them become popular. Doing particularly well in either activity provided an opportunity for users to be granted a free 30-day pass to the service. The Club Nintendo/My Nintendo version of Flipnote Studio 3D limits the sharing of Flipnotes to local wireless between 3DS systems, though users may still export their creations to SD cards and download Flipnotes from the DSi version. Nintendo officially announced that Flipnote Studio 3D’s Flipnote Gallery: World online service in Japan would officially end in April 2, 2018 at 10am Tokyo Time. There have been two phases in the closure of the service. The first phase was the end of ticket sales which were required to use the service. Ticket sales ended on October 2, 2017 at 10:00 AM Tokyo time, then Flipnote Gallery: World closed its doors on April 2, 2018 at 10:00 AM Tokyo time. Nintendo also added once ticket sales officially end, the “free time” duration for users to access the service would be extended and that the number of coins given the users daily would be increased. It's unclear whether the DSi Library on Flipnote Studio 3D, which hosts Flipnotes from Flipnote Hatena (an online service for Flipnote Studio on Nintendo DSi), will be impacted in the west. A community-developed Flipnote Gallery: World service was created from the Nintendo DSi Library feature of European and American versions of Flipnote Studio 3D named Kaeru Gallery (formerly Project Kaeru and kaeru:world). However, this service is only able to be accessed with a modified Nintendo 3DS. Development Flipnote Studio 3D was originally announced by Shigeru Miyamoto under the name Flipnote Memo. Other than this mention, there was no further news on the eventual release of the application until a Nintendo Direct Mini broadcast on March 13, 2013. In this official announcement, several features were revealed, such as the ability to create 3D Flipnotes using up to 3 layers. This was the first time that the application was referred to as Flipnote Studio 3D. The broadcast also announced a release date of mid-2013. Flipnote Studio 3D was released in Japan on July 24, 2013. Originally, the application was to be released in Europe on August 1, 2013. However, on July 30, 2013, Nintendo of Europe tweeted that, due to the unexpectedly high use of the online services in Japan, the application's release would be delayed. They also promised to announce a new release date \\"as soon as possible.\\"Flipnote Studio 3D  Nintendo 3DS download software  Games  Nintendo Nintendo of America's official website for the application originally indicated an \\"Early August 2013\\" release date, but on August 7, 2013, this release date was changed to \\"TBD\\" without any accompanying notice of a delay. On November 1, 2013, the Flipnote Gallery: Friends service was discontinued in Japan due to the possibility of underage users sending/receiving \\"inappropriate content\\" via the service. Simultaneously, Nintendo globally disabled SpotPass features for their messaging app Swapnote/Nintendo Letter Box for similar reasons. After 16 months without any announcement, on November 21, 2014 Nintendo removed all mention about Flipnote Studio and Flipnote Studio 3D in the English translation for a Japanese interview about Pikmin Short Movies in Miiverse. On January 20, 2015, Nintendo announced that North American members of Club Nintendo, which was due to close later in the year, will be able to download Flipnote Studio 3D free between February and June 2015. This version limits sharing of Flipnotes to local wireless, though users may still download Flipnotes from the DSi version's gallery and transfer creations to an SD card. On February 2, 2015, Nintendo announced that Flipnote Studio 3D would be released later that week. However, on February 5 the wording changed to simply imply it would be released that day, which it temporarily was, and after a period of \\"maintenance\\", it was changed to say it would be released that month. The application was eventually released via Club Nintendo in North America on February 10, 2015. On March 31, 2016, Flipnote Studio 3D became available again for North America and for the first time in Europe, Australia, as well as Mexico and Brazil, via the My Nintendo loyalty program. It was available from March 31 until April 30, and was free to redeem. Although the PAL version initially featured buttons that supposedly access Flipnote Gallery: Friends/World communities, they were not functional, and this version is restricted to the similar functions as the North American version. The buttons were later removed via an update. On December 1, 2016, Flipnote Studio 3D became available again for the Americas alongside the release of the My Nintendo website revamp and the introduction of child accounts in all regions. Unlike previous offers, the app is available indefinitely without an expiration date, although it requires members to spend 200 Platinum Points to redeem it. With the introduction of child account support, users under 13 years can officially acquire Flipnote Studio 3D, as this was not previously possible on either Club Nintendo or My Nintendo at launch before the revamp. Flipnote Studio 3D became available again for Europe and Australia as of January 1, 2017. On April 2, 2018, the remaining online service, Flipnote Gallery: World, ceased operations. Reception Flipnote Studio 3D has received mostly positive feedback since its release in Japan. A Nintendo World Report editorial stated that the now-removed Flipnote Gallery: Friends feature was not very well put together. However, it also praised Flipnote Gallery: World and the wealth of other sharing options available. Despite the current lack of SpotPass features, the editorial expressed that Flipnote Studio 3D is still a lot of fun, and Nintendo should still release the then-delayed application in the West. The stripped-down international version of Flipnote Studio 3D was received with mixed reactions.

In the ensuing engagement with French Marshal Nicolas Soult's advance guard, British units were overwhelmed and forced to mount a hurried withdrawal across the bridge. Ultimately, however, the French forces failed to press their advance further due to heavy losses including the death of French Brigadier General Auguste François-Marie de Colbert-Chabanais. The resulting delay allowed Moore's forces to continue their retreat while keeping their forces largely intact. Geography The village, on a plain in the mountainous region past Ponferrada on the road from Astorga to La Coruña, is in the line of retreat taken by Moore's army to A Coruña, and its double arch stone bridge crosses the river Cua,Hadaway, Stuart (2000) \\"Rifleman Thomas Plunkett: 'A Pattern for the Battalion.'\\" Retrieved 2 August 2013. a tributary of the Sil. Battle Moore, who was camped at Villafranca, half a day's march away in the direction of La Coruña, had ridden back to see Edward Paget whose elder brother Henry, Lord Paget, had led a successful cavalry clash at Benavente just a few days previously. The rearguard of Moore's troops, having arrived at Cacabelos the previous day, and delayed by the effects of rioting and the severe cold, was preparing to cross the bridge, when the 15th Hussars informed Paget that French cavalry units were rapidly approaching from Ponferrada. Soon, between 450 and 500 troopers of the 15eme Chasseurs à Cheval and 3eme Hussards, Marshal Nicolas Soult's advance guard, led by Brigadier General Auguste François-Marie de Colbert-Chabanais caught up with the tail end of the army, capturing around 50 British soldiers caught by surprise. Deciding to press his advantage, and without waiting for infantry or artillery support, Colbert prepared to attack the bridge.Moore, Richard. \\"Plunket’s Shot: A reconstruction of a famous exploit in the history of the 95th Rifles\\" Retrieved 2 August 2013. However, on seeing the 95th Rifles, the 28th Foot, and six guns of the Royal Horse Artillery in position on the other side of the bridge, Colbert withdrew his men to reform them in a column of fours prior to rushing the bridge. Moore, meanwhile, who had almost been captured by Colbert's men, looked on from the western hill above the road, with Paget. When the French cavalry charged across, they were forced to retreat after being decimated by British rifle fire. Among the French fatalities was Brigadier Colbert himself who reportedly was killed immediately prior to the French attack. Ibid. When La Houssaye's cavalry and infantry support arrived they tried to cross the river by a ford a short distance downstream from the bridge and Merle’s infantry division tried to take the bridge \\"a la baionette\\". However, by around 4.00pm, it was too dark to continue and the French troops, possibly considering the British troops' defensive position too good, and also possibly low in morale due to the death of Colbert, desisted. At about 10.00pm, Paget was able to set off towards Villafranca with no sign of French troops in pursuit. Plunket's Shot Colbert-Chabanais was killed by a single long-range shot from a Baker rifle, fired by a noted sharpshooter of the 95th Rifles, rifleman Thomas Plunket, and who also, with a second shot, killed the officer who came to Colbert's assistance. Although there is much discrepancy regarding the distances involved, the shot has been claimed to have been as far as 600 metres,Hadaway, Stuart. Rifleman Thomas Plunkett: 'A Pattern for the Battalion.'Costello, Edward - 'Rifleman Costello' First published in 1841 entitled \\"The Adventures of a Soldier\\". Costello served with Plunkett and can both cite personally witnessed experiences and the legend he already was at the time. it's highly likely that Colbert considered himself well beyond the musket range of 80 metres and therefore safe, whereas the Baker had verified target accuracy of 200 metres. Consequences Although British troops gained time in their retreat towards La Coruña, Moore has since been criticised for being too hasty in his retreat and for not having made better use of strong defensive positions such as the one at Cacabelos.Rickard, J.

He was a leader in the provision of humanitarian care for mental hospital patients. Blumer was born in Sunderland, England. His father was a physician as were his two brothers. His early education in England was followed by schooling in Germany and France. In 1874, he entered the medical school at the University of Edinburgh and remained for one year before he emigrated to the United States. He completed his medical degree at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and graduated in 1879. After a residency of one year at Lankenau Hospital in Philadelphia, he obtained a post of assistant physician at the New York State Lunatic Asylum (also known as the New York State Inebriate Asylum) in Utica, New York, under the superintendency of John P. Gray, M.D., a prominent psychiatrist. Gray died in 1886 and Blumer became the superintendent of Utica. Blumer instituted many reforms at Utica. He abolished all forms of patient restraints, improved living conditions for patients, placed women nurses on male wards, established occupations and amusements for patients, and succeeded in officially changing the name of the institution to Utica State Hospital. In 1890, the New York State legislature established a State Commission on Lunacy with the director to be responsible for the administration of the state mental hospitals. The Commission of two lay members and a chief psychiatrist began to follow the legislature’s charge but encountered opposition from the state hospital superintendents who, until then, exercised total control of their institutions. It was an ongoing struggle between the Commission and the superintendents, and Blumer took an active role. Blumer’s struggle with the Commission included the Commission’s attempt to take over the leading psychiatric publication in the United States, the American Journal of Insanity. The journal had been established and edited by Amariah Brigham, the first superintendent at Utica and was owned by the hospital. An earlier court ruling confirmed that the hospital owned the journal. Blumer arranged for the American Medico-Psychological Association, now the American Psychiatric Association, to purchase the journal and publish it as the Journal of the American Psychiatric Association, which continues today. As editor of the American Journal of Insanity, Blumer influenced the psychiatric community. He remained an editor emeritus of the journal until he died. In 1899, he accepted the post of Superintendent of the private Butler Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island where he remained until his retirement in 1921. Blumer remained in Providence after retirement and was named Superintendent Emeritus of Butler. Blumer was elected president of the American Psychiatric Association from 1903 to 1904. His presidential address dealt with the politicization of state mental hospitals, eugenics, and the role of immigration relating to state hospital missions. While at Butler, Blumer participated in numerous community organizations. He was president of the Providence Athenaeum in Rhode Island, a trustee of the Rhode Island School of Design, president of the Rhode Island Historical Society, on the Board of Visitors at Brown University, and director of the State Mental Hygiene Society. Blumer received honorary degrees from Brown University (L.H.D., 1905) and from Hamilton College (L.H.D. 1921). He was named an honorary member of Phi Beta Kappa in 1921 by Brown University. He died in 1940. Works Blumer, George A. \\"A Case of Perverted Sexual Instinct (conträre Sexualempfindung),\\" American Journal of Insanity (1882): 22-35.

The museum was opened on the day of the 75th anniversary of the Holodomor in 2008 and gained the status of a national museum in 2010. The museum is located on the Pechersk Hills on the right bank of the Dnieper river in Kyiv, adjacent to the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra.  History  On 28 November 2006, the Parliament of Ukraine (Verkhovna Rada) voted to recognize the Holodomor, a devastating famine which took place in the early 1930s in the former Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, as a deliberate act of genocide against the Ukrainian people. The bill was signed into law by President Viktor Yushchenko and included a provision for commemorative and research activities, and the construction of memorials to honour the victims and preserve the memory of the Holodomor tragedy for future generations. The Memorial in Commemoration of Famines' Victims in Ukraine was erected on the slopes of the Dnieper river in 2008, welcoming its first visitors on 22 November 2008. The ceremony of the memorial's opening was dedicated to the 75th anniversary of the Holodomor. On 8 July 2009, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine signed a decree that established a state museum \\"The Memorial in Commemoration of Famines' Victims in Ukraine\\". The museum subsequently acquired the status of a national museum on 18 February 2010. Starting from February 2010, the museum has been included in the official program for visits to Ukraine by Heads of States and foreign delegations and officials. On 31 July 2015, the Ministry of Culture of Ukraine renamed the museum in order to reflect the singular instance of the famine- genocide known as Holodomor. Prior to this, the museum, which represents three famines – the 1921-1923 famine, the 1932-1933 famine, and the 1946-1947 famine – used the term 'Holodomor' as a plural term. The plural has been removed in order to offset the understanding of the Holodomor being the 1932-1933 famine as being exclusively deemed to be genocidal in nature.  Architecture and symbolism  Statue known as the Bitter Memory of Childhood; a copy can be seen in Winnipeg The museum consists of the memorial complex and the underground Hall of Memory that houses permanent exhibitions and artifacts from the famines’ periods. The memorial complex was conceptualized and designed by the Ukrainian folk artist Anatoliy Haydamaka and architect Yuriy Kovalyov. The symbolism of the famines’ events and human sufferings is amply portrayed on the museums’ grounds and in its architecture. The entrance of the alley to the memorial complex is framed by two statues of angels, referred to as the Angels of Sorrow. The angels represent the guardians of the souls of the starved. In the centre of the alley, 24 millstones (the Millstones of Destiny) are set in a circle and carry a dual meaning. On the one hand, they symbolize the source of food and life. On the other hand, they represent a 24-hour clock, reminding that up to 24,000 human lives were ground to death daily during the Holodomor. A haunting statue of a young girl clutching a handful of wheat stands is in the middle of the alley. This statue, named the Bitter Memory of Childhood, is dedicated to the most vulnerable victims of starvation – children. Picking up wheat left on the collective farm fields after reaping was considered a crime and was punishable by up to 10 years of imprisonment or even death. The paving leading to the centre of the memorial and the Hall of Memory symbolizes the highly fertile black soils of Ukraine. The central part of the memorial is a white, 30-meter high candle-shaped monument, known as the Candle of Memory. The monument is decorated with glass crosses of different sizes arranged in a Ukrainian folk embroidery pattern. The crosses symbolize the souls of the famines’ victims, young and old. The bronze figures of storks soaring from the base of the monument represent the rebirth of the Ukrainian nation. Entrance to the Hall of Memory Below ground is a well-conceived Hall of Memory. In the Hall, visitors have an opportunity to commemorate the famines' victims by lighting a candle and by ringing a bell. A 20-minute educational film about the Ukrainian famines is projected on the walls of the Hall. A collection of artefacts dating back to the famines is displayed. These include period farm equipment, agricultural tools and household items. Visitors also have an opportunity to browse the volumes of the National Memory Book of Famine’s Victims of 1932-1933 and provide information about their relatives who died of starvation in Ukraine. The Hall of Memory leads visitors to the Black Board Alley. The symbolic black boards document the names of Ukrainian towns and villages which had suffered during the dark years of the famines. The names of 14 thousand villages and towns of Ukraine are engraved on the boards, which have become one of the most striking symbols of the Holodomor.  3D Model Bitter memory of childhood  The company AERO3Dengineering in 2017 year was developed at National Museum Statue known as the “Bitter memory of childhood” .  Location and access  thumb The museum is situated on the Pechersk Hills, one of Kyiv’s most picturesque and ancient places on the high bank of the Dnieper, near the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra. The museum is easily accessible by public transport, the closest metro station is Arsenalna Station. The museum is open everyday from 10:00 until 18:00. Technical day is the second Tuesday of the month. General admission fee to the underground section of the museum (the Hall of Memory) is 30 hryvnas for adults, 20 UAH for Students, 15 hryvnas for children. Guided tours are offered hourly from 10:00 to 17:30 and are available in Ukrainian, English, Russian. In 2012, the museum received more than 470,000 visitors, offered 2,160 guided tours, and hosted eight official delegations.  Educational and research activities  The museum's goal is to collect, study, preserve and disseminate materials and knowledge that illuminate the Holodomor as an act of genocide against the Ukrainian people, to remember the scale of the tragedy of the Ukrainian famines, and to learn from these events so that they never occur again. The museum currently offers educational programs and exhibitions. It plans to expand its educational efforts to include outreach programs for schools, post-secondary establishments and public libraries, as well as to offer teachers training sessions and seminars on the history of the Holodomor. The museum is working on creating a database of the Ukrainian famines' survivors and victims, which will be made accessible to the Ukrainians and the international community.  Memorial on-line  In 2012, the museum, in partnership with the International Renaissance Foundation and the Memorial in Commemoration of Famines' Victims in Ukraine charity, launched an Internet project to provide open and free access to collections of digitized materials on the Ukrainian famines. The project provides centralized access to archival collections of documents, periodicals, photographs, videos, and survivor and witness testimonies on all three famines in Ukraine the information is contained in the most complete Martyrology containing the names of about 900,000 dead in 1932-33.  International collaboration  The museum aims to expand its activities to become a global centre for research on famine, victimization and human rights. In July 2012, the museum signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Canadian Museum for Human Rights to share knowledge, best practices and research resources related to the Holodomor. Both organizations committed to working together to educate the international community on human rights issues, with a particular focus on the relevance of the human rights lessons of the Holodomor.

This can result in visual fatigue, headaches, and difficulty reading. The delay in accurate accommodation also makes vision blurry for a moment when switching between distant and near objects. The duration and extent of this blurriness depends on the extent of the deficit. Signs and symptoms Most common symptom of accommodative infacility is difficulty in changing focus from one distance to other. Treatment Vision assessment and cycloplegic refraction should be done. If there is any refractive errors, it should be corrected before considering orthoptic treatments. The accommodative infacility is commonly treated with vision therapy/orthoptics; one study found that 12 weeks of treatment had a significant effect on visual accommodation.

Diston was the second son of Josiah Diston of Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire and his wife Mary. He was from a dissenting family. For several years he was a leading factor in the cloth trade at Blackwell Hall, the London cloth market. The cloth trade brought him wealth and he became closely connected with the town of Devizes in Wiltshire. In 1701, Diston became a Director of the Bank of England. He stood for Parliament for Devizes at the 1705 English general election, but was defeated. However he was returned as Member of Parliament for Devizes at a by- election on 11 December 1706. Having established a political presence at Devizes, he used his wealth to consolidate his interest, spending, it was said, £3,000 by the spring of 1708 in preparation for the general election. He also took part in intense political struggles within the corporation of Devizes. As a result, he headed the poll at Devizes at the 1708 general election. In November 1708, he was on the committee for drafting a bill encouraging woollen and iron manufacturers, and in March 1709 he voted for the naturalization of the Palatines. He was put forward to draft a bill for public registration of deeds, wills and conveyances made in Wiltshire, and voted for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. However, at the 1710 general election, there was a double return at Devizes and he was dislodged. He was also defeated at Devizes at the 1713 general election. From about 1713 Diston began buying up land at Epsom, where he built a house, Mount Diston (now Woodcote Grove), where he lived for approximately 15 years. Diston was again returned as a Whig MP at Devizes at the 1715 general election. In Parliament he voted for the Septennial bill and for the repeal of the Occasional Conformity and Schism Acts. He voted against the Peerage Bill in 1719. In 1721 he became Deputy Governor of the Bank of England for the next three years and also Receiver General of Taxes for Westminster and Middlesex. He lost his seat at Devizes in 1722, when he only polled two votes, and did not stand again. He also started to sell off his property in Epsom. He had incurred a debt of £23,446 by 1726, when he failed as receiver general. His sureties had paid up only £17,574 by August 1730. He spent the rest of his life in debt and was in receipt of royal bounty from then until his death. Diston died at Hampstead on 7 November 1737.

State senate redistricting Harpool was the chair of the Missouri Senate redistricting committee. On August 18, 2011 the map submitted by the committee was turned down by the Republican members of the committee. While on the committee he focused on population growth and census data to redraw the district boundaries. Senator John Lamping and many in opposition voiced their concerns over the proposed map because it would eliminate his district altogether. Citing population trends and census data, Harpool argues that Saint Louis County must lose the seat in order for fair representation to the faster-growing areas like Greene, Stone and Barry counties. Federal judicial service On August 1, 2013, President Obama nominated Harpool to serve as a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri, to the seat vacated by Judge Richard Everett Dorr, who died on April 24, 2013.

The New York Times. July 26, 2002. Retrieved 15 July 2013. Life A native of Hartford, Connecticut, Giard majored in English literature and received a B.A. from Yale University in 1961, then an M.A. in Comparative Literature from Boston University in 1965. For a time he taught intermediate grades at the New Lincoln School. By 1972, he began to photograph, concentrating on landscapes of the South Fork of Long Island, portraits of friends, many of them artists and writers in the region, and the nude figure.Ibid. In 1974, Giard settled in Amagansett, Long Island, with his life partner, Jonathan Silin, an early childhood educator, where they remained for nearly thirty years until Giard's death. In the beginning years of his career, Giard did much of his landscape photography during the late autumn, winter, and early spring when many of the fashionable houses of the Hamptons were boarded up for the season. Career Ultimately, it would be in the area of the formal portrait that Giard¹s career made its most indelible mark. In 1985, after seeing a performance of Larry Kramer¹s The Normal Heart dealing with the crisis of AIDS, Giard set about documenting in straightforward, unadorned, yet sometimes witty and playful portraits, a wide survey of significant gay and lesbian literary lights.Beller, Peter C. (13 March 2005). \\"PHOTOGRAPHY; Portraits of the Gay Literary Life\\". The New York Times. Retrieved 16 July 2013. His portraits included such iconic figures as Edward Albee, Allen Ginsberg, and Adrienne Rich, as well as emerging novelists making their first mark, including Sapphire, David Leavitt, Shay Youngblood, and Michael Cunningham. A selection of these portraits, culled from the five hundred examples he had by then already amassed, was published by MIT Press in 1997 as the anthology Particular Voices: Portraits of Gay and Lesbian Writers, which then served as the companion volume to the New York Public Library¹s 1998 exhibition of the same name.Giard, Robert. \\"Particular Voices Robert Giard's Portraits of Gay and Lesbian Writers : the New York Public Library, Center for the Humanities, Third Floor Galleries, April 18-June 27, 1998\\". New York Public Library. New York Public Library. Retrieved 16 July 2013. At the time of his death in July, 2002, just shy of his 63rd birthday, Giard was working on a portrait documentation of the three hundred twenty-one grant recipients from around the country of the Thanks Be To Grandmother Winifred Foundation, which until 2001 supported projects by women fifty-four years and older that benefited other mature women. Grants supported research and artistic projects, as well as efforts to alleviate social, economic, and medical problems for women in a given locality. Giard, traveling the country by train, bus, and plane (he never had a driver¹s license) succeeded in photographing two hundred forty-one of the women grantees, and kept a journal of his travels and his many visits to a richly diverse group of American women in small towns and major cities. Robert Giard was the recipient of many grants and awards, and the published version of Particular Voices won a Lambda Literary Foundation Award for Best Photography/Art Book in 1997. Giard had a long and distinguished solo and group exhibition career throughout the United States. Examples of his work are in collections of Brooklyn Museum, San Francisco Public Library, New York Public Library, and the Library of Congress. Giard¹s complete archive, including work books and ephemera, is now housed in the American Collection of the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University. Legacy The Robert Giard Foundation was formed in 2002 with the aim of preserving his photographic legacy, promoting his work for educational purposes, and encouraging the work of young photographers.

José Hernández Delgadillo (1927 – December 26, 2000) was a Mexican painter and muralist best known for carrying on the traditions of Mexican muralism in the latter 20th century. He created over 160 murals in Mexico and the United States, with most of his work, especially after 1970, containing strong political messages. Many of these messages have been unpopular in Mexico, which has made the artist somewhat obscure and some of his murals have been destroyed. Hernández Delgadillo's main recognition is membership in the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana honor society, but his home state has made effort to rescue and promote his life and work. Life Hernández Delgadillo was born in Tepeapulco in the Mexican state of Hidalgo, the son of a poor rural farm worker. He grew up working on farms, road construction, in a greenhouse and making furniture. In 1945, he traveled to Mexico City and studied painting and architectural drawing at the workshop of Antonio Navarrete Tejero. To survive during this time, he made money by creating portraits. After the first individual exhibition of his work, he decided to pursue advanced training, attending the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \\"La Esmeralda\\" from 1955 to 1960. According to his autobiography, at this time he met Pablo O'Higgins which inspired him to continue the ideals of Mexican muralism. In addition to his art career, he was also very politically active. He believed that popular organization in neighborhoods, unions and schools was necessary to exert non-violent pressure against the government. From 1980 to 1983 he wrote a weekly column for the Excélsior newspaper, which allowed him to write to present an alternate point of view and appear more neutral. In 1985, he stood for the Partido Mexicano de Trabajadores in the 38th electoral district, covering the Magdalena Contreras area and part of Alvaro Obregon. He was a pre candidate for president with the PRD in 1987, but the party chose Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas. The artist then worked for the Cárdenas campaign creating murals. Hernández Delgadillo died in 2000, leaving behind his wife, Beatriz Zamora and three children, Beatriz, Myriam and Francisco. Career Hernández Delgadillo's first exhibition of his easel work was in 1954 in Mexico City. He returned to school afterwards but when he finished his studied, he won recognition at two biennials, the II Bienal Interamericana in Mexico and the II Biennale de Paris for his expressionistic painting called Hombres (1961). This success earned him a grant to Paris from the French government. From 1963 to 1965 he lived in the country, exhibiting his work in Nice, Lyon, Marseille, Le Havre and Bordeaux as well as in the Reflets Gallery in Brussels and the Biosca Gallery in Madrid. The Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris bought one of his works as well. He had another important individual exhibition in Beverly Hills in 1967. However, most of the artist's career was dedicated to muralism, creating over 160 of them, twenty of which are on university campuses in Mexico. His first mural was painted at the Escuela Primaria Belisario Dominguez in 1959. In 1969, he was named director of arte for the Centro Residencial Morelos, a housing project in Mexico City. He and students created forty murals, the largest of which consists of fifteen floors of abstract panels places among the windows. In the center of the small plaza between the apartment buildings, he created a monument highly critical of the social order, which put his career at risk. In 1973, he created the first of his militant murals. His main support was with student organizations, which invited him to paint in universities, technical schools and teachers’ colleges in various parts of the country. The artist created the designs and usually the students did the actual painting, using simple colors. Many times, the mural was done in a day, with the students using the occasion to also present musical productions, and discussion groups. From 1973 to 1976, he worked on posters which featured large powerful figures in basic colors, based on the designed for murals in also done at this time in Mexico City, Toluca, Xalapa, Pachuca, Fresnillo, Zacatepec de Hidalgo, Tepic and the teachers’ colleges in Tuxtla Gutiérrez. In 1975 he created a mural in the medical conference center of the former Hacienda de Cortés in Cuernavaca. He created his first mural in the United States in 1981 in San Fernando, California, sponsored by a Chicano organization. He returned in 1989 to create several works for the agricultural school of University of California, Davis, a Latino social service organization in San José and the mayor's office in Watsonville. In the 1990s he created one of his major works called El Hombre Nuevo Hacia el Futuro. Many of Hernández Delgadillo's murals are in urgent need of restoration with a number already lost, either due to deterioration or because they were destroyed because of their political messages. In 2013 an effort was begun Pachuca to rescue and restore his murals in that city, which include Contradicciones y lucha en Hidalgo at the Jardín del Arte and Por la democracia, el trabajo y la soberanía nacional at the Miguel Alemán primary school. Other activities during his career include sculpture, receiving commissions between 1959 and 1960, and illustrating medical books in 1963 and 1972. In 1997 he organized the first competition of murals and public art called the Jornada Mundial del Arte Público y Muralismo, at the Palacio de Bellas Artes . His main recognition was membership in the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana (SPM), an honor society for Mexican artists, serving on its executive committee in the 1970s. After his death, the SPM established the José Hernández Delgadillo Prize in categories such as painting, print making, sculpture, photography and art objects and held a retrospective of his work in 2009. The Efrén Rebolledo Cultural Center in Pachuca has a gallery named after him. However, his work has become obscure, mostly because they espouse unpopular and radical political ideas. There was no biography written about him until 2008, when Hidalgo writer Guillermo Furlong Franco published a book called Muros de Insomnio, about the life and work of the artist. It was sponsored by the Fondo Estatal para la Cultura y las Artes of Hidalgo. Artistry Hernández Delgadillo was an artist and activist in the tradition of Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros, with his work more closely related to the second state of Mexican muralism rather than his contemporary Generación de la Ruptura . This was particularly true after the 1968 student uprising in Mexico, which inspired the artist to incorporate its ideology to reinvigorate Mexico's traditions of murals with social and political messages. In 1975, he described himself as one of the few artists still “fighting for Mexico.” He stated that it was “… very risky to do political art now. You put your subsistence and liberty at stake.” He also stated “After 1970, I conceived most of my visual work in line with popular struggles, in books, periodicals, posters, films and murals; this side of my work is predictably ignored by the educated public, and negated and attacked even by critics who purport to be revolutionaries.” He worked in oil, acrylics, mixed media, print and poster making and some sculptures in bronze. His style was mostly expressionistic, often denouncing acts of violence. Some murals, such as those done at university campuses rely on simple, basic colors but others more nuanced used of color, such as shades of reds and ochre are used to express anger at social injustices. Justino Fernandez wrote “In the works of Hernández Delgadillo, we find a definite sense of the monumental and certain underlying classicism combined with personal expressionism. This may seem contradictory, but is not, thanks to the synthesis to which he brings both tendencies.” “His giants – images of men and women, entire or fragmented nudes with extraordinarily expressive heads large or small, their features barely insinuated, their eyes tiny – betray his humanist leanings.” Similar to the artists of the Mexican muralism movement, he used indigenous cultural expression to highlight the country's heritage, its abilities as well as how it has been exploited. Many of his figures have a primeval quality, as if they sprang from the earth.

Biography Bruce Irwin was born in 1921 in Whanganui. He fell in love with orchids in New Zealand, and attended Whanganui Technical College there. When World War II began, he was 17 years old and was working at the survey department in New Plymouth. He and his friend Sid Gibson used to collect and draw orchids in nearby Egmont National Park. Despite his military service and a year spent in occupied Japan, he carried out a great deal of work with Sid's son Owen Gibson on Mount Taranaki and executed a number of orchid watercolors during the war and in the immediate postwar period. Irwin later worked for the Cartographic Branch of the Department of Lands and Survey, where his paintings came to the attention of the botanist Lucy Moore. He quit the Cartographic Branch in 1962 and went to live at his camp in Marlborough Sounds. A collaboration with Moore began, which resulted in his illustrating Volume II of the Flora of New Zealand (1970) and The Oxford Book of New Zealand Plants (1978). By the 1970s, he had taken a part-time job in the Art Department of Otago Medical School. He largely abandoned watercolors for large-scale pencil drawings, which he felt better illustrated botanical points. After 11.5 years of work on illustrations for The Oxford Book of New Zealand Plants, he retired from his job to pursue orchid cultivation in Tauranga. In 1986 he did some illustrations for Clarkson's Vegetation of Egmont National Park and in 2007, Brian Tyler published a book of his drawings. During the last years of his life, he cultivated orchids at the Te Puna Quarry Park. He received a number of botanical awards, and a species of Pterostylis was named after him, Pterostylis irwinii.

In 2013, trained by Todd Pletcher, he established himself as one of the leading three-year-old colts with early wins in the Tampa Bay Derby and Wood Memorial Stakes. He finished fourteenth in the Kentucky Derby and missed the remaining two legs of the Triple Crown but returned to prominence later in the summer with wins in the Pegasus Stakes and the Haskell Invitational Stakes. In his four-year-old year, he was campaigned in Europe, trained by Aidan O'Brien. Background Verrazano is a bay colt with a white stripe and two white socks bred by Emory A Hamilton at Middlebrook Farm near Lexington, Kentucky. Steve Haskin has described him as looking \\"like Hercules next to mere mortals\\". His sire, More Than Ready, showed his best form over sprint distances, recording his most important success in the Grade I King's Bishop Stakes at Saratoga in 2000. He stands at the Vinery Stud in Kentucky, and has also been shuttled to stand in Australia and New Zealand during the southern hemisphere breeding season. As a stallion his greatest success before the emergence of Verrazano had come with his southern hemisphere stock, including More Joyous, a mare who won nine Group One races. Verrazano's dam Enchanted Rock showed no ability on her only racecourse appearance, but has become a successful broodmare, also producing the Risen Star Stakes winner El Padrino. As a yearling, Verrazano was consigned by the Middlebrook Farm to the Keeneland sale. On 14 September he was sold to the Let's Go Stable (managed by Bryan Sullivan and Kevin Scatuorchio) for $250,000. Scatuorchio named the horse after the Verrazano- Narrows Bridge. Racing career =2013: three-year-old season= Verrazano was unraced as a two-year-old, making his racecourse debut on January 1, 2013, in a Maiden Special Weight over six and a half furlongs at Gulfstream Park. Ridden as in all his races by the Puerto Rican-born Hall of Fame jockey John Velazquez, he took the lead in the straight and drew away from his ten opponents to win by seven and three-quarter lengths in a time of 1:16.48. A month later at the same course, Verrazano was moved up in distance for an allowance race over one mile and started the 1/5 favourite. Taking the lead on the final turn, he increased his lead throughout the closing stages to win by sixteen lengths in a time of 1:34.8, just over a second outside Commentator's track record. The Blood-Horse described the performance as a \\"spectacular\\" one which established Verrazano as a Kentucky Derby prospect. Following the race a half share in the colt was bought for an undisclosed sum by the Coolmore organisation, represented by Michael Tabor, Susan Magnier and Derrick Smith. Verrazano remained in Florida for his next race on March 9, when he was stepped up in class and distance to contest the Grade II Tampa Bay Derby over one and one sixteenth miles. Starting the 2/5 favourite, he bobbled leaving the starting gate but recovered quickly and took the lead after three furlongs. He was never seriously challenged and won by three lengths \\"with a bit in reserve\\". After the race, Pletcher said: \\"It was a good performance. He is a lot like his sire; he has a great disposition and a great mind... he is so naturally fast for a big horse\\". Pletcher moved the colt north to Aqueduct Racetrack in April for the Grade I Wood Memorial Stakes, an important trial race for the Kentucky. Velasquez positioned the 4/5 favorite just behind the leaders before taking the lead half a mile from the finish. He held the persistent challenge of Vyjack throughout the closing stages and won by three quarter of a length from the fast-finishing Normandy Invasion. Following his success, Pletcher called Verrazano \\"the legitimate Kentucky Derby favorite\\" whilst admitting that the colt still lacked experience and had a tendency to idle in the straight. On 4 May, Verrazano was one of nineteen colts to contest the 139th running of the Kentucky Derby. He looked likely to dispute favoritism on the morning of the race but was weakly supported on the course and started the 8.7/1 fourth choice behind Orb, Revolutionary, and Goldencents. He was among the early leaders as Palace Malice set an exceptionally fast pace but came under pressure approaching the final turn and faded in the stretch, finishing fourteenth behind Orb. Verrazano missed the two remaining legs of the Triple Crown, reappearing on June 16 in the Grade III Pegasus Stakes at Monmouth Park. The colt's task was made much easier when his main betting rival, Preakness Stakes runner-up Itsmyluckyday, pulled up injured early in the race, and he led from the start before drawing away in the stretch to win by nine and a quarter lengths. After the race, Velasquez commented, \\"His ears were wagging every step of the way and around the three- eighths pole I gave him a little nudge, and he knew it was time to go\\". Verrazano returned to Grade I competition in the Haskell Invitational Stakes at Monmouth Park on July 28. His main rival appeared to be Preakness winner Oxbow, while the field also included Vyjack and Kentucky Derby runner-up Golden Soul. Velasquez tracked Oxbow before overtaking the Preakness winner three furlongs from the finish. Verrazano extended his advantage throughout the closing stages and won by nine and three-quarter lengths from Power Broker. The winning margin was the widest in the history of the race. Velasquez said, \\"He was awesome today. He did it real easy and made me look very good. He was going so good. I knew I had a lot of horse left. When I asked him to go down the stretch, he did it.\\" Verrazano started the 8/5 favorite for the Travers Stakes on 24 August against a field which included Kentucky Derby winner Orb and Belmont Stakes winner Palace Malice. He tracked the leaders but faded in the straight and finished seventh of the nine runners, seven lengths behind upset winner Will Take Charge. Verrazano's final race of the year was the Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile on November 1, 2013; it had been announced that he was most likely to be retired to stud. He started the 5/2 favorite but struggled to match the early pace and finished fourth behind Goldencents. On 30 November, Verrazano, ridden for the first time by Javier Castellano, contested the Cigar Mile Handicap at Aqueduct. He finished third of the ten runners behind Flat Out, with Groupie Doll in fourth and Goldencents in seventh place. =2014: four-year-old season= In February 2014, it was announced that instead of retiring, Verrazano would be campaigned in Europe, being trained by Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. The colt made his European debut in the Group One Lockinge Stakes at Newbury Racecourse on 17 May and finished third to Olympic Glory. A month later, he was beaten three- quarters of a length into second place by Toronado in the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot. O'Brien described the performance as a \\"lovely run\\" and nominated the Eclipse Stakes, International Stakes and Irish Champion Stakes as possible targets. On 5 July Verrazano started at odds of 7/1 for the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse but after racing in fourth place until halfway, he weakened and finished last of the nine runners behind Mukhadram. He was lame after the race, and the injury was not deemed \\"significant\\" but was severe enough that he would not be ready to run by the Breeders' Cup races in the fall.  Stud career  On August 14, 2014, it was announced that Verrazano would be retired and stand at stud in the United States at Ashford Stud in Kentucky. In September 2019, Verrazano was sold to stand in Brazil. Pedigree Verrazano is inbred 3 x 4 to Mr. Prospector, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree.

The only speech he is known to have made was on 30 March 1739, when he seconded a motion for the repeal of the Test Act. He was an alderman of London for Cheapside from 1739 to 1740. Eyles married Sarah Jefferies, the daughter of Sir Jeffrey Jefferies. He died on 8 February 1740 leaving a son and two daughters.

He was an early user of the literary technique stream of consciousness, and Les Lauriers exemplifies the style. Dujardin claimed later, in a study of the technique and its application in Joyce's Ulysses, that he was the first to use it in Les Lauriers. The title derives from a French children's song, \\"Nous n'irons plus au bois\\" (\\"We'll go to the woods no more\\"), where the withering of the laurel tree is a prelude to regrowth, the latter period marked by joyous song and dance. The novel adheres to that spirit, capturing the thoughts of a student in Paris over a six-hour period in the spring. Background Like many symbolists, Dujardin believed music to be an expression of interior life. In turn, interior monologue, being a-rationalist and anti-intellectual, could point the novel's way toward expressing the unconscious. Analogous with music (music being taken as the origin of language), interior monologue had an affinity with a more primitive and thus more original language. Like many symbolists, Dujardin had been greatly impressed with the music of Richard Wagner, and how important Wagner was to him and others was made clear by the foundation (with Téodor de Wyzewa) in 1885 of the journal La Revue wagnérienne. Interior monologue, then, was to be the translation of the musical (and Wagnerian) idea of the Leitmotif into the novel, and narrative subjectivism to be the dominant perspective. Plot The novel's plot is purposely underdeveloped, as Dujardin acknowledged in a later essay on his novel and its technique, Le Monologue intérieur (1931) and especially in a letter written a year after the novel's publication. His is a \\"roman de quelques heures, d'une action banale, d'un personnage quelconque\\"—a novel whose narrative time is only a few hours, of a banal action, with a random [main] character. It concerns a naive and amorous student, Daniel Prince, who is about to be taken in by an actress, Lea d'Arsay, whose only interest is his money. As the novel develops, Prince daydreams of proposing the actress to elope with him, and when he is in her apartment, before they are to take an evening stroll, he falls asleep and dreams of his past, of his parents and the first girl he fell in love with. Technique and definition According to Dujardin, the idea was to represent a character's thoughts as directly as possible, with the least possible mediation from an author—thoughts were to be represented as if they were a monologue directed at no one, and the author was not to comment on any of it. Syntax was of no concern, since the thoughts were to be as close as possible to the character's unconscious. Lawrence Edward Bowling points out that Dujardin's arguments actually covered a wide range of possible interiority, since the character's words are at the same time almost-conscious speech as well as almost- unconscious unordered thought. Bowling distinguishes between \\"stream of consciousness\\" and \\"interior monologue\\" and finds both in the novel; the former, he says, occurs clearly and most perfectly in a dream sequence (when \\"the mind drops below the level of language usage and functions by means of pure images and sensations\\"), but much of the other material in the novel is thought turned so consciously into language that it is far from unmediated. The question of narrative technique (also called \\"Unframed Direct Interior Monologue\\", or UDIM) remains a matter of some critical discussion. In addition, between French and English there is some confusion regarding the technical terminology: in French, monologue intérieur means both \\"stream of consciousness\\" and \\"interior monologue\\"; the latter, it is suggested, could be seen as an extreme version of the former precluding, for instance, multiple viewpoints (such multiplicity is rejected by Dujardin). Theory and influence Though the invention of the stream of consciousness technique is frequently ascribed to Dujardin, from the 1920s to the 1950s there was considerable discussion about Dujardin's claim, though it was supported by James Joyce and Joyce's friend and translator Valery Larbaud in the 1920s, even before Dujardin made those very claims in Le Monologue intérieur. There were other candidates as well: Elizabeth Drew, in 1926, proposed Dorothy Richardson, and Katherine Gerould, in 1927, Henry James. In addition, passages from Fyodor Dostoyevsky are sometimes cited as precursors, passages which Dujardin attempted to differentiate from his own writing. Lawrence Richard Bowling, however, after defining the stream of consciousness technique as \\"that narrative method by which the author attempts to give a direct quotation of the mind--not merely of the language area but of the whole consciousness\\", finds that Richardson's prose has much more authorial mediation than Dujardin's. Still, Dujardin has his detractors; poet and literary historian Gleb Struve finds other authors who he says experimented with the form long before Dujardin, including Leo Tolstoy (and he credits Nikolay Chernyshevsky with describing it as such) and Laurence Sterne. The novel's greatest influence was that on Joyce. He mentioned in 1922 to Larbaud that it had been his inspiration for Ulysses; Larbaud, in turn, got Les Lauriers republished and, by associating Joyce and Dujardin, helped resurrect the latter's career. The novel was translated into English by Stuart Gilbert, and published in 1938 by New Directions Publishing as We'll to the Woods No More. That title is the first line of the prefatory poem in Last Poems (1922) by A. E. Housman. Its second line is \\"The laurels are all cut\\", which suggests that Housman may have known the French original.

Nicholas V, also known as Nicholas VIII (, Nikoloz; 1529 – 1591) was the Catholicos Patriarch of Georgia from 28 February 1584 to 1591. He was born into the Bagrationi dynasty of Kakheti, a son of King Levan (r. 1520–1574). He was canonized by the Georgian Orthodox Church as the Holy Father Nicholas the Catholicos of Georgia, his feast day marked on 18 February (N.S.: 2 March).  Biography  Nicholas was born as a younger son of King Levan of Kakheti either of his first marriage to the Gurian princess Tinatin or his second marriage to a daughter of the shamkhal of Tarku. Nicholas was, thus, a younger brother or half-brother of Alexander II, who won the bloody competition for the throne of Kakheti after Levan's death in 1574. Nicholas was enthroned as the Catholicos Patriarch of Georgia on 28 February 1584, succeeding on the death of Catholicos Nicholas IV. His tenure was during the turbulent period of Georgia's history; the once flourishing medieval kingdom had been divided into several competing polities and the Georgian church had been split into the eastern and western counterparts, reflecting the country's political division, the eastern church being under the stewardship of Nicholas; his native Kakheti was threatened by the rival expansionism of the Safavid Iran and Ottoman Turkey. Nicholas corresponded with Patriarch Job of Moscow, who died in 1607, and exchanged gifts with him. He also donated a leather-bound illuminated manuscript of the Gospels, copied in 1049, to the Metekhi church in Tbilisi. The 18th-century author Timote Gabashvili reports that there was an icon of Catholicos Nicholas in the refectory at the Iviron monastery on Mount Athos. Gabashvili also conjectured that another refectory, built at the Iviron at the behest of the Georgian prince Ashotan of Mukhrani, might have been Nicholas's deathplace.

The book covers his early life, rise in politics and 12 year tenure as the longest serving prime minister of Iran from 1965 to 1977 during the reign of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi until his trial and execution in the aftermath of the Iranian revolution in 1979. Title and content Hoveyda in court, 1979 The book is a product of Milani's four-year extensive study. The title of the book makes an analogy between Hoveyda and the Sphinx which is a figure used in Persian art and sculpture. The Sphinx is \\"a mythical creature with the body of a lion, most often with a human head and sometimes with wings.\\" The book provides a detailed biography of Hoveyda from his childhood in a middle-class family with aristocratic roots, his education at distinguished institutions in Beirut, London, and Brussels, his career, including his premiership (1965-1977), to his tragic end of death by execution in April 1979 following the 1979 revolution. In addition to Hoveyda's life, the book covers the background social developments in Iran from 1918 to 1978 and the relations between Iran and the US at this period of time. Throughout the book, Milani also highlights Hoveyda's impact and legacy on Iranian politics and history. Milani has included nearly all information about Hoveyda through analysis of archival materials that had before not been examined including Hoveyda's unpublished correspondences and diaries and also through interviews with more than a hundred of his family members, friends, and others with differing views. The last chapter of the book, which is about Hoveyda's trial, is based on the tapes recorded during the process. Editions The book was originally published in English by Mage Publications by IB Tauris in the United Kingdom in 2000. The Persian version of the book was published in 2002 with the translation of Milani, entitled Moamay-e Hoveyda. The publisher of this edition is Atiy-e Press in Iran. Another Persian version of the book was published in 2001. As of 2013, English version of the book is in third print and the Persian version by Milani in fifteenth print. Reception George E. Gruen stated positive remarks about the book, arguing that the book provides the reader with very detailed account of Iran from 1918 to 1979 and of the relations between Iran and the US during the related period. James A. Bill adds that the book offers the reader an opportunity to fully understand the underlying mechanisms of the Iranian revolution. Mark Dankof, reviewed the book in Global News Net (GNN) and the Iranian Times, praised Milani's narration, the use of footnotes and photographs, and added that the book efficiently reflects the country during the Pahlavi era. However, he also stated that some of Milani's points in the book are either contradictory or overemphasized. Mostafa Rahimi, in his review in the journal, Jahān-e Ketāb, claimed that Milani's book attempts to present Hoveyda as an intellectual, arguing that Hoveyda was just \\"a power-hungry politician\\". Another Iranian reviewer, Afshin Matin Asgari of California State University, describes the topic of the book as controversial without giving his specific reference. For him, the book is \\"disappointing\\" due to the author's overt bias towards the subject and events narrated. He further argues that although the sources are mostly scientific, the informants whose reports are frequently cited are often family members such as Hoveyda's brother, Fereydoun Hoveyda, and his former wife, Laila Emami. S. Cronin in his review also expresses similar views and argues that Milani did not adequately describe the harsh aspects of the Shah's regime. He also adds that the language used by Milani to describe the judges at the Hoveyda’s tribunal, such as Ayatollah Sadegh Khalkhali, is so biased that it does not help the book in enhancing his main arguments. The book was reviewed in Journal of Islamic Studies by Shahrough Akhavi, an adjunct professor of political science at Columbia University and distinguished professor emeritus of political science at the University of South Carolina. He states that although book has some weakness, it is due to scarce scientific materials on the subject. He also remarks that the author used the available materials from the French Foreign Ministry Archives for 1944-55, the John F. Kennedy Library, the Lyndon B. Johnson Library, the National Security Archive and the National Archives in Washington DC as well as scientific articles by Iranian scholars. However, he also argues that the book does not cover all details about Hoveyda's last days. For instance, there is no mention of Hoveyda's posthumous award with the title of Commander of the Legion of Honour and letters of six French prime ministers to Khomeini to save his life.
