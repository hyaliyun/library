It argues that technology can be used to create a post-scarcity economy of widespread prosperity. To defend its argument about the future, the work—styled as a manifesto and described as such by some commentators—turns to the past. It argues that human history can be divided into three broad periods, each characterized by substantial changes in technology: prehistory to the dawn of agriculture; agriculture to the Industrial Revolution; and the present period, characterised by the explosive spread of information technology. Bastani suggests that the prosperity ushered in by technology is inconsistent with contemporary models of capitalism. While capitalism is organised around a logic of scarcity, the technologically- mediated prosperity he predicts is characterised by the absence of scarcity. Kellokumpu argues that the work fails to account sufficiently for the impact of climate change and the dependence of contemporary industry on fossil fuels. Barker echoes this assessment, noting that ecological destruction appears to be the consistent result of past technological transitions and that, in this respect, it is likely that the future will resemble the past.

It was reprinted from a report Hornaday wrote for the Smithsonian Institution in the years 1886–87. Extermination contains an exhaustive account of bison ecology and the story of the near-entire destruction of the bison population in the United States. The book argues for the consequent necessity of protecting the small number of bison then in Yellowstone National Park. The book is divided into three parts. The first relates to the habits, geographical distribution, and probable population of the bison before European settlement. The second describes the extermination of the animal. It argues that the speed of extermination has been increased by unnecessary slaughter and the lack of legal protection of the bison population, among other things. The third part describes the Smithsonian's 1886 expedition to Montana to obtain specimens for the National Museum of Natural History before bison went extinct in North America.

Bejarano was also named as One of 10 artists to Watch in KQED Arts’ Bay Brilliant Top 10 Artists of 2018.  Early life and education  Bejarano grew up in Bell Gardens southeast of Los Angeles, CA raised by a single mother. When Bejarano's older brother Rigoberto brought his trumpet home in middle school, Bejarano would sneak into the case and play the instrument. She taught herself to play for a year before joining her middle school band. She continued in marching bands and later auditioned for the Troopers, a prestigious competitive drum and bugle corp. In return for a two summer commitment to the corp, the Troopers would help Bejarano get a full scholarship to Casper College in Wyoming, > \\"I was working on my degree in music education, and I did residencies where > I had to go into a middle school or high school, just to get the hands-on > experience of working with children.

Classical music was not a part of her childhood in the low-income minority community Bejarano grew up in. Bejarano did not discover classical music until her first year in college. In order to fulfil the requirements of her trumpet music scholarship, Bejarano had to play in a few ensembles. When she did, she said \\"it was like that music was already ingrained in [her] body, but it just needed to be activated.\\" Bejarano's initial degrees were in Music Education as she had aspired to be a music educator at a prestigious high school or college. When she decided to change her focus to conducting, she said she probably would have been dissuaded if she had realized how complicated that is for women and how much more complicated that would be for a woman with her background and ethnicity. She was told many times that she would \\"never be a successful conductor in the U.S. due to her looks and background.\\" After graduating from University of California, Davis, Bejarano was accepted into a doctoral program in orchestral conducting at University of South Carolina. She was also offered a $2000 per year position as Assistant Conductor or the Peninsula Symphony in Los Altos, California. Bejarano chose to conduct instead of pursuing her doctorate.  Career  Bejarano started her conducting career as an Assistant Conductor of the Peninsula Symphony. Later she became the Principal Conductor the San Francisco Civic Symphony, the oldest symphony west of the Mississippi. Bejarano is also Assistant Conductor of Opera Parallele in San Francisco, CA and a guest conductor for the Bay Area Rainbow Symphony. She has been a guest conductor in Russia, Bulgaria, Italy, Romania, Spain, Venezuela, Finland and the Czech Republic, and with orchestras in the U.S. from Santa Cruz to Baltimore.

It was built in 1800 in Libohovë, near Gjirokastër in southern Albania. The site lies on a hill overlooking the Dropull plain south of Gjirokastër, on the east side of the valley near the small village of Vlaho Goranxi. In 1800, the tekke was most likely built to replace an earlier one by Baba Aliu, head of the Zall Tekke, but some sources date it to 1870. Baba Aliu's tomb is next to the main building. The courtyard is overgrown with cypress trees and includes an Ottoman shadirvan supplied with water by an aqueduct. The extensive two-story main building includes a prayer hall and adjoining rooms where the Shi’a-influenced Bektashi dervishes pray, study, meditate, and listen to the babas’ sermons. Followers of the order gather for ceremonies as well as outdoor picnics on the grounds. The hill was home to Epirote and Illyrian forts in antiquity, and material from a fort wall was used to build the tekke. Ceramic remains from the 4th century BC have also been found nearby. The walls were reinforced in the 5th century and 6th century. The remains of a small medieval church can be found here, and a Christian monastery is said to have predated the tekke. Today, the tekke is secluded on the eastern slopes of the valley, but the caravan route through the Drin Valley went through at one point. John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton and Lord Byron traveled through on their journey Ioannina to Tepelenë to meet Ali Pasha of Ioannina. The tekke was badly damaged by Greek troops during World War I and World War II. The area was declared a cultural heritage site in 1963, but would be closed and partially destroyed during an anti-religious campaign mounted by dictator Enver Hoxha of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania in the late 1960s, an emulation of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. The Albanian Armed Forces sometimes used the building. After the ban on religion was lifted in 1990, the tekke was rebuilt by worshipers from Nepravishtë, Libohovë, and Lazarat from 1994 to 2002.. Today, the tekke is governed bythe Gjirokastër Sufi patriarchate () and is staffed by a live-in dervish.

Officials staffing CBPS' inspect vehicle traffic entering California for the presence of pests; vehicles discovered to be carrying infested cargo are denied entry to the state. History =Background= As of 2017, approximately 13 percent of United States agriculture production occurred in California, with agribusiness directly generating $47.1 billion of economic activity in the state. The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) is a state government agency with a primary mandate of protecting California \\"against invasion of exotic pests and diseases\\". California Border Protection Stations are 16 checkpoints placed at California's land borders with neighboring states and maintained by the CDFA for the purpose of monitoring vehicle traffic entering the state for the presence of cargo infested with pests. As of 2017, an average of 27 million vehicles were stopped and inspected annually by CBPS staff. =Development= Border Protection Stations were first established by California in 1920. A 1968 plan to close the stations and replace them with six regional inspection hubs in the interior of the state was ultimately scuttled after opposition to the proposal was mounted by county agriculture officials. Beginning in 1970, inspectors were issued blue uniforms to, according to the Sacramento Bee, \\"help present a 'Welcome to California' image\\". =Efficacy= According to the California Department of Food and Agriculture, every dollar spent on maintaining the CBPS' saves $14 in economic losses that would be incurred by the introduction of pests. Legality In the 1980 case of People v. Dickinson, in which a motorist was arrested after 200 pounds of marijuana was discovered in his vehicle at a California Border Protection Station, the California Court of Appeal ruled that \\"quarantine officers may stop motorists at the inspection stations and request to look into the trunk of the vehicle. This is in accord with United States v. Ortiz and United States v. Martinez- Fuerte. If the motorist voluntarily opens the trunk of the vehicle, the quarantine officer may look therein and, as here, remove any plant materials in plain view for further inspection\\". Procedures Vehicles entering California from Oregon, Nevada, or Arizona, are profiled at CBPS' to assess their potential risk. Passenger vehicles with California license plates, or those of bordering states, are considered low risk and are generally subject to only a cursory screening which consists of an inspector asking the vehicle's driver questions about the contents of his or her vehicle. Other vehicles – particularly recreational vehicles, commercial trucks, or those carrying watercraft or livestock – are considered higher risk and may be subject to a visual inspection of cargo and contents. During the 2016–2017 fiscal year, one CBPS in Yermo denied entry to California to 882 cross-border shipments. In addition, apiary cargo is logged by inspectors and the driver required to declare a final destination in California. Logs of such shipments are then forwarded to the agricultural office of the destination county so that a more thorough inspection of the cargo can be made upon its arrival.

She is considered a pioneer among Latin American women journalists.  Early life  Freyre was born in 1844 in Tacna, a city in southern Peru. She was one of six children born to Juana Arias and Andrés Freyre Fernández. Her father was the director of several newspapers and the owner of a printing house. She studied at the Colegio Nacional de Educandas de Tacna, a school where young women learned to become teachers, and at a very young age she became a math teacher. Her writing career also began very early; she published her first verses of poetry at only 14 years of age, in one of her father's newspapers.  Career  Carolina Freyre was active in Lima's veladas literarias (literary soirees) in the 1870s. Freyre began contributing to various publications including La Bella Taceña and La América, writing on social issues in particular. In 1871 she began writing for El Correo de Lima, publishing articles on \\"The Scientific Spirit of the Century,\\" \\"Women's Education,\\" etc. The following year, she began contributing opinion pieces to the newspaper La Prensa, as well as historical essays. She went on to found a new publication, Cofradía Lírica, in collaboration with other young writers. It was later known as Bohemia Tacneña. Having settled in Lima, Freyre became part of the city's intellectual social scene established in the 1870s, joining a group of women writers led by Teresa González de Fanning from Ancash, Mercedes Cabello from Moquegua, and Clorinda Matto from Cusco. The group was established through a variety of cultural spaces, particularly the literary soirees held in the home of the Argentine writer Juana Manuela Gorriti. In addition to these women, Freyre befriended the Peruvian intellectual Ricardo Palma, whom she may have met at one of Gorriti's soirees. On May 23, 1874, along with Gorriti, she launched the first edition of El Álbum, described as \\"a weekly magazine for the fair sex.\\" El Álbum was the first women's magazine led by women themselves in Peru. Freyre directed the magazine alongside Gorriti for the first 16 issues, after which she assumed full responsibility for the publication. She also transferred her long-running column \\"Revista de Lima,\\" which had previously appeared in the newspaper La Patria, to El Álbum. Beyond her work on this magazine, she also published frequently in the magazine La Alborada, which Gorriti founded with Numa Pompilio Llona in 1875. Freyre frequently advocated for women's rights in her work, as part of Peru's early feminist movement, although her calls for women's education did not extend to fully liberating women from the domestic sphere.  Personal life  Carolina Freyre was married to the Bolivian writer Julio Lucas Jaimes, nicknamed \\"Brocha Gorda,\\" with whom she had six children: Julio, Ricardo, Federico, María Carolina, Julia Rosa, and Raúl. Her second son, Ricardo Jaimes Freyre, became a well-known poet. She lived throughout her life in Tacna, Lima, Sucre, and Buenos Aires. Her family resided in Tacna during part of the Chilean occupation of that area. Her brother Andrés Freyre Arias was an important figure during the War of the Pacific and worked alongside Carolina and her father on the family's editorial and journalistic endeavors, which had a significant cultural influence in Tacna.  Death and legacy  Freyre died in 1916, in Buenos Aires. A street in her hometown of Tacna was named in her honor.

It is a kind of French bean. As a vegetable, it is similar to beans. Raw Forash is cooked as a vegetable, though the main part is its seeds. Forash is usually cooked with fish and meat. It is served with cooked rice and Roti. For the Sylhetis who live abroad, especially in the United Kingdom, the United States and the Middle East, Forash is dried in the sun and sent in packets to them.  history The climate of the Greater Sylhet region is dry in winter and the soil is moist, so Forash has been cultivated in Sylhet since ancient times. It first came to Sylhet from France. This is why it is called Forash in Sylheti language. This vegetable is grown well in the alluvium soil of Sylhet. This winter vegetable has also been growing in Chittagong and Comilla in recent years. Because of its popularity among the worldwide Sylhetis, it is exported to several countries including England, America and Canada.  Ingredients  Vegetable oil, cinnamon, cardamom, salt, onions, chilli powder, turmeric, ground coriander and garam masala.  Procedure  Before cooking Forash should be soaked 4-5 hours. Then it should be removed from the shell. Then it should be washed and drained. At the beginning, oil needed to be heated in a pan. Adding a little salt, onion is fried with chilli, cardamom and cinnamon. Then ginger and garlic is added if needed. When the onion turns yellow, half a cup of water is required. When the bubbles come out, turmeric and chilli powder should be poured. Then the seed of Forash can be added. It is needed to mix well and keep on medium heat for a few minutes. At that time, one and a half cups of water can be poured. Placing a lid on the pan, it needs some more time on medium heat. Finally the coriander leaves can be spread on the dish.

It was the first episode of the third season of the anthology television series Playhouse 90. Delbert Mann was the director, and the cast included Melvyn Douglas as Joseph Stalin, Eli Wallach as Stalin's personal secretary, and Oskar Homolka as Nikita Khrushchev. It was nominated for two Sylvania Television Awards: as the outstanding telecast of 1958 and for Douglas as outstanding actor in a television program. The production, set during the final months of Stalin's life, received generally positive reviews in the American press, but the Soviet Union protested the depiction of Krushchev's alleged role in Stalin's death and retaliated by closing CBS's Moscow news bureau and ordering its Moscow correspondent to leave the country.  Plot  The play opens in Stalin's office on October 4, 1952, on the eve of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. After a visit from his principal deputies, Stalin reveals to his personal aide, Alexander Poskrebyshev, his belief that there is a plot against him. In order to derail the plot, Stalin plans to dissolve the Politburo and replace it with a new Presidium. After Stalin announces the dissolution of the Politburo, the Party's top leaders attend a reception and discuss Stalin's decision. Driving home that evening, Georgy Malenkov is urged by his wife to go into hiding. Mrs. Molotov suspects Stalin's intentions, but Molotov declares his continuing loyalty to Stalin. Back in Stalin's office, Stalin informs Semyon Ignatyev, the Minister of State Security, that a doctors' plot led by Jews is underway to assassinate high-ranking officers in the Red Army. Stalin urges Ignatyev to uncover the plot. On leaving Stalin's office, Ignatyev informs his associate that there is no doctors' plot and that Stalin is instead seeking a reason to purge Lavrentiy Beria. When the play resumes, Ignatyev presents his evidence that Beria is covering up the doctors' plot. Beria learns that he is under investigation and interrogates a prisoner at Lubianka Prison, seeking to learn what information has been furnished to Stalin. On February 9, 1953, after a wave of arrests, Beria tells Molotov that Stalin intends to liquidate all of the members of the former Politburo. Beria proposes that Stalin instead be liquidated and that Malenkov take Stalin's position. Malenkov agrees to the plan. Sergei Shtemenko, Chief of Staff of the Soviet armed forces, is informed of the plot against Stalin and vows to assist Stalin in crushing the plot. When Shtemenko informs the other members of the Soviet general staff, Marshall Vasily Sokolovsky reminds Shtemenko of Stalin's purges against the Red Army and insists that the military must remain neutral and not interfere. Stalin continues to receive reports on the plot and predicts infighting over who will succeed him. The production then cuts to Beria and Nikita Khrushchev plotting with each other to become joint leaders instead of letting Malenkov take over. On March 1, 1953, Stalin invites Malenkov, Krushchev, Molotov and Beria to a meeting. Stalin says that he wishes to discuss his succession. After toying with the men, Stalin angrily confronts them with his knowledge of their plot. In the midst of the exchange, Stalin collapses on the floor from a stroke. Poskrebyshev enters to render assistance, but Krushchev refuses to allow any aid to be given to Stalin and throws his support to Malenkov as Stalin's successor. After leaving Stalin on the floor overnight, Malenkov escorts a doctor to see Stalin. Malenkov assures the doctor that, if Stalin dies, it is understood that Stalin was an old man and that no harm will befall the doctor. The doctor realizes that Malenkov and the others do not want Stalin to live and that his own life is in danger. Stalin finally dies, and as the plotters gather to view Stalin's body, Beria's troops surround the city, and the plotters plot against each other.

Production In July 1958, CBS announced that it would open the new season of Playhouse 90 with a play about the final five months of Stalin's life. Fred Coe was selected as the producer and Delbert Mann as the director. David Karp was hired to write the teleplay. In researching the subject, Karp conferred with experts, including a former Soviet leader. He was also assisted by The New York Times former Moscow correspondent, Harrison Salisbury, who was credited as a technical advisor. In August, CBS announced the principal casting decisions, including Melvyn Douglas as Joseph Stalin, Eli Wallach as Stalin's personal secretary, E.G. Marshall as Lavrenti Beria, and Oscar Homolka as Nikita Krushchev. The play was broadcast at 9:30p.m. on September 25, 1958, as part of the CBS television series Playhouse 90. The art director was Robert Tyler Lee.Production credit for art director is taken from the on- screen credits displayed at the end of the teleplay. Reception = Critical reception = The teleplay was nominated for two Sylvania Television Awards: as the outstanding telecast of 1958 and for Douglas as outstanding actor in a television program. It also received generally positive reviews from critics. In his review of the play, Jack Gould of The New York Times praised the performances of Homolka and Douglas as Krushchev and Stalin, but criticized the absence of character development. Gould also questioned the wisdom of depicting Krushchev as \\"virtually a murderer\\" and accused the program of \\"pursuing sensationalism.\\" UPI television critic William Ewald credited makeup man Bud Sweeney for his \\"superb job\\" and praised the overall production as \\"a gripper\\", \\"90 minutes packed with urgency.\\" Associated Press critic Charles Mercer called it fascinating and opined: \\"Seldom has TV drama presented such a gallery of vivid characterization by an outstanding cast.\\" Harry Harris of The Philadelphia Inquirer called it \\"engrossing\\" and \\"a rouser\\" and praised both the effective acting performances and the skillful direction of Delbert Mann. Cecil Smith of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"superb.\\" Larry Wolters of the Chicago Tribune called it \\"a taut, suspenseful drama, superbly played\\". =Soviet response= Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev reportedly \\"hit the ceiling\\" when he learned of his depiction in the American television play. In response, the Soviet Union's Ambassador to the United States, Mikhail A. Menshikov, filed a formal protest with the United States Department of State. Menshikov called the production \\"filthy slander\\" and stated that the Soviet Union expected the American government \\"to prevent such anti-Soviet acts.\\" When the State Department responded that CBS was a private corporation which was not controlled by the government, the Soviet Union retaliated directly against CBS, ordering the network to close its Moscow news bureau, withdrawing its accreditation of the network's Moscow correspondent, Paul Niven, and telling Niven to leave the country and close the bureau within two weeks. CBS News issued a statement complaining about \\"severe censorship\\" of coverage from the Soviet Union. Following the Soviet response, Jack Gould of The New York Times opined that, in depicting the current Soviet leader \\"for practical purposes\\" as Stalin's murderer, CBS made a \\"stupid mistake\\" and exercised \\"poor judgment\\". CBS was not permitted to reopen a Moscow bureau until 1960.

Located in Fairmount Park, the statue was completed in 1871 and donated to the city in 1876.  History  Alexander von Humboldt was a Prussian polymath active during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. In May 1804, during one of his scientific journeys through the Americas, he visited Philadelphia. On September 13, 1869, on the centennial anniversary of Humboldt's birth, the cornerstone for a monument honoring him was laid in Fairmount Park, on a knoll overlooking the Girard Avenue Bridge, by the city's German society. The statue on Humboldt was designed by Friedrich Drake, a German sculptor based in Berlin. It was dedicated in 1871. Several years later, in 1876, on the centennial of American independence, the statue was gifted to the city of Philadelphia and dedicated again. According to the Association for Public Art, the statue was moved to another part of the park in 1977.  Design  The monument consists of a bronze sculpture of Humboldt placed on a granite socle.

Life and works  He was born in Yerevan. From 1840 to 1842 he attended the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg where he studied with Alexander Sauerweid and Alexander Varnek; becoming exposed to the ideas of many of the upcoming intellectuals of that time, including Gabriel Sundukian and Ivan Aivazovsky. From 1846 to 1865, with some breaks, he taught painting at schools in Tbilisi and Shusha. During these years, he came to specialize in portraits and landscapes. His painting Holiday on the Banks of the Kura River (1860) is considered to be the starting point of a new period in Armenian art. Many of his early portraits show the influence of the Hovnatanians, a prominent family of miniaturist painters. Later portraits, beginning with that of General Vasili Bebutov (1857), and culminating with those of Mesrop Mashtots and Sahak Parthev (both 1882), connect early 19th century Armenian painting with developments of the second half.

The first was one of three principal operating agencies of PHS from 1943 until 1966, while the second was a division of the PHS Health Services Administration from 1973 until 1982. Both incarnations of the bureau had the principal responsibility of operating the PHS hospital system that had been founded in 1789. The system had reached its peak of 30 hospitals upon the formation of BMS in 1943; this number decreased throughout BMS's existences. The first incarnation of BMS also had responsibilities in medical examination of foreigners entering the country, funding construction of hospitals by the states, researching the effective utilization of medical personnel and services, and providing healthcare to Native Americans. The original BMS was broken up at the beginning of the Public Health Service reorganizations of 1966–1973, but a second incarnation of BMS was established at their end as a division of the Health Services Administration within PHS. This incarnation of BMS inherited only the hospital system and closely related functions, with the other programs located in other divisions. The system reached its final number of nine in 1970, and the system was abolished in 1981 with all but one hospital transferred to other organizations. The bureau was merged with another division in 1982 to form the current Bureau of Primary Health Care. The other divisions of the original BMS now form the Indian Health Service, part of the Healthcare Systems Bureau of the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Division of Global Migration and Quarantine of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Federal Occupational Health within the Department of Health and Human Services Program Support Center.  As operating agency of the Public Health Service  Staten Island PHS Hospital was established in 1831, with the current main building constructed in the 1930s. After 1981 it became a private hospital.Top 100 Historical Events in Staten Island, Richmond County, NY, from the Staten Island Advance. Pacific Medical Center in Seattle opened in 1933. After 1981 it was transferred to the City of Seattle, which leased the building as office space. PHS Hospital San Francisco was established in 1875, with the current building constructed in 1932. After 1981 it was used as a branch of the Defense Language Institute, was vacant for two decades, and then reopened in 2010 as apartments.Presidio of San Francisco - Public Health Service Hospital (U.S. National Park Service)(archived version at the Wayback Machine, 2007) Nassau Bay PHS Hospital opened in 1972 as a private hospital, but it went bankrupt a few years later and was taken over by PHS, replacing the Galveston hospital. It became private again after 1981. = Formation = The Marine Hospital Service, the predecessor of the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS), first divided itself into divisions in 1899. By 1943, PHS contained eight administrative divisions, plus the National Cancer Institute, St. Elizabeths Hospital, and Freedmen's Hospital under the direct supervision of the Surgeon General. These divisions often had overlapping scopes, which was seen as administratively unwieldy. Additionally, some of these had been created and specified through several pieces of legislation that were inconsistent in their scope, while some had been created internally by PHS or delegated from its parent agency, the Federal Security Agency. A 1943 law () collected PHS's divisions into three operating agencies. These were the National Institute of Health for laboratory research, the Bureau of State Services for administering cooperative services to U.S. states through technical and financial assistance, and the Bureau of Medical Services for direct patient care through hospitals and clinics. In 1943, BMS consisted initially of the Hospital Division, Foreign Quarantine Division, and Office of Nursing. It also initially contained the Mental Hygiene Division, which was separated as the National Institute of Mental Health and moved into the National Institutes of Health in 1949. = Hospital system = As of 1957, the hospital system provided free healthcare to merchant seamen; active and retired Coast Guard personnel, officers of the PHS Commissioned Corps and Coast and Geodetic Survey, and their dependents; members of the general public with leprosy or narcotics addiction; and federal employees with compensable job-related illnesses and injuries. Occupational health programs for federal employees were part of the Division of Hospitals during most of the bureau's existence, but they were split out into a separate division for two brief periods, during 1947–1949, and 1966–1967. In 1943, the hospital system had reached its peak of 30 hospitals. As of 1957, the Division of Hospitals operated 13 hospitals, 24 outpatient clinics, plus two neuropsychiatric hospitals and the National Leprosarium, and contracted with 155 other locations. In 1965, there were 12 general hospitals and the 3 special hospitals. = Other functions = The Foreign Quarantine Division provided examination and vaccination of foreigners entering the country, as well as pest control programs for ships and airplanes. The Division of Health Facilities Construction was established in 1947. In 1949, the Division of Hospital Facilities was transferred from Bureau of State Services, and they were merged into the Division of Hospital and Medical Facilities in 1955. This division was transferred back to the Bureau of State Services around 1960. The division's function was to fund construction of hospitals by the states through the Hill–Burton Act, and research into effective utilization of hospital facilities. In 1949, Divisions of Medical and Hospital Resources, Dental Resources, and Nursing Resources were established. The Division of Hospital and Medical Resources was abolished in 1953, and the latter two mere merged into their counterparts in the Bureau of State Services in 1960. These divisions researched the effective utilization of dental and nursing personnel and services. The Division of Indian Health was acquired from Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1955.  Reorganization period  BMS was abolished at the beginning of 1967 in the first of four major reorganizations of PHS. Most of BMS's divisions joined with the Bureau of State Services' Community Health divisions to form the Bureau of Health Services in 1967, and then became part of the Health Services and Mental Health Administration (HSMHA) in 1968. The Division of Hospitals became the Federal Health Programs Service, the Division of Indian Health became the Indian Health Service, and the Division of Hospital and Medical Facilities became the Health Facilities Planning and Construction Service. The Division of Foreign Quarantine, however, was taken over by the Communicable Disease Center in 1967. HSMHA was broken up in 1973. The Federal Health Programs Service became a new Bureau of Medical Services within the Health Services Administration (HSA), and the Indian Health Service was also moved into HSA. The Health Facilities Planning and Construction Service merged with the Community Health Service (which had come from the Bureau of State Services) to form the Bureau of Health Resources Development within the Health Resources Administration. The Indian Health Service would later be promoted to operating agency status in 1988.  As division of the Health Services Administration  A 1980 pamphlet about the Bureau of Medical Services within the Health Services Administration The second incarnation of the Bureau of Medical Services was strictly the successor of the old Division of Hospitals rather than the entire old bureau, as the other divisions were placed elsewhere in PHS. In 1970, there were eight general hospitals in the system, with hospitals in Savannah and Detroit having closed in the previous two years, and prior to that in Memphis and Chicago. In 1980, BMS ran eight general hospitals in Boston, Staten Island, Baltimore, Norfolk, New Orleans, Nassau Bay, San Francisco, and Seattle, plus 28 outpatient clinics and the National Leprosarium. It also included separate divisions for Coast Guard medical services, federal employee occupational health, and emergency medical services. The PHS hospital system had been the target of efforts to close the entire system since the mid-1970s, but these efforts were hampered by a federal law that required the system to be funded to at least the 1973 level, and the opposition of Senator Warren Magnuson, who retired in 1980. This law was repealed in 1981 as the result of pressure from the Reagan administration. This forced the end of PHS hospital system by the end of 1981, with the last eight hospitals transferred to other organizations. The Reagan Administration's intention was to completely close the hospitals that were in poorer condition, but this faced opposition from local groups concerned about decreases in hospital capacity. The administrator of the Seattle Hospital even refused to stop admitting patients even after being specifically directed to do so by authorities in Washington, leading to a confrontation between him and eight federal inspectors. The opposition led to Congress approving additional funds to improve the hospitals to state and local standards, so they could continue to be operated by other agencies or organizations. Ultimately, five hospitals were transferred to non-governmental entities, two to the Department of Defense, and one to the State of Louisiana. PHS would however continue to operate the National Leprosarium until 1999. In 1982, the Health Services Administration merged with the Health Resources Administration to form the Health Resources and Services Administration. As part of the merge, the Bureau of Medical Services merged with the Bureau of Community Health Services to form the Bureau of Health Care Delivery and Assistance, which was renamed the Bureau of Primary Health Care in 1992. The Division of Federal Occupational Health remained in the merged bureau, but by 2003, it had been transferred to the Program Support Center, part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration.

History  Since the capital was moved to Kyoto in 794 and up to the Meiji Era, Kyoto was the epicenter for the development of the history of Japanese paintings. For this reason, there was a high demand for the pigments used in the broad range of creations related with this particular field. Ueba Esou was founded in the year 1751. According to its 10th generation owner, Ms. Yumi Ishida, in the past Kyoto had a thriving industry of painters, usually also in charge of creating the designs necessary for the Kyo-yūzen and the Nishijin-ori fabrics produced in the city. In turn, there were plenty of shops offering pigments of natural origin, about 20 in the vicinity of Ueba Esou’s location.  Present day  Nowadays Ueba Esou is the only store offering natural pigments left in the area. It continues to produce and sell pigments primarily used in Nihonga, such as iwaenogu (made by grinding mineral ores), which in some cases includes lapis lazuli and other precious materials, resulting in a high-priced product. The company is also known for the production and selling of gofun, a white pigment made with the shell of hotate, a species of scallop (Mizuhopecten yessoensis). In recent years, the company introduced a new product called “Gofun Nail”, a water-based nail polish made using gofun pigment, which enjoys popularity among the younger generation and was one of the winners of the 2015 Good Design Awards.

The seat was comfortably won by Jeremy Kinross of the Liberal Party despite a 5.5% drop in the Liberal primary vote, and a 5.7% drop in their two party preferred vote. Background The seat of Gordon, a traditionally safe Liberal seat, was held since 1976 by Tim Moore. However, with the hung parliament result of the 1991 election, the performance of the Greiner government had become dependent on the support of the few independent members of the legislative assembly. When former minister Terry Metherell resigned in October 1991 the government's ability to command a majority became even more difficult. The government subsequently created a job for Metherell, a position with the Environment Protection Agency, which he accepted, effectively engineering a vacancy in a seat the Liberal Party would recover at a by-election. While the Liberal Party won the by-election, there was a much higher cost. Because the Greiner government was in a minority, it could not prevent the Legislative Assembly referring the matter of Metherell's appointment to the Independent Commission Against Corruption, which made findings of corruption. These findings were eventually ruled by the Supreme Court of New South Wales as being outside the powers of the ICAC to make, but by then Premier Greiner had already resigned as Premier and an MP after the four independent MPs threatened to bring down the government if Greiner stayed in office. Result Tim Moore () resigned.

Located in the city's Humboldt Park, the statue was designed by Sigvald Asbjørnsen and erected in 1901.  History  Leif Erikson was a Norse explorer who is credited as being one of the first known Europeans to have set foot in continental North America. In the late 1800s, following the discovery of historical evidence supporting his explorations and further Norse colonization of North America, various monuments and memorials to Erikson began to be erected across the United States, mainly by Scandinavian American and Norwegian American communities. This was the case for the Norwegian community in Chicago's Northwest Side in the late 1800s. Prior to the city's Columbus Day celebrations in October 1892, the Norwegian community hosted a celebration in honor of Leif Erikson's discovery of North America. Writing in the Norwegian language newspaper Skandinaven, Nicolai A. Grevstad said that in the lead up to the World's Columbian Exposition, held in the city in 1893, a committee was formed for the purpose of creating a statue honoring Erikson. Plans had been made for the statue's unveiling to coincide with the arrival of a replica Viking ship from Bergen, but ultimately, construction of the sculpture would be delayed. The statue, designed by Norwegian American sculptor Sigvald Asbjørnsen, was officially dedicated on October 12, 1901, in a celebration attended by many in the city's Norwegian community. The statue, created at a cost of $10,000, was erected in Humboldt Park.  Design  The bronze statue, depicting Erikson with a shield in his left hand, is tall and rests on a large boulder.

Life  Born in Wesel, Deetz, son of a medical officer, first dedicated himself to military service and in 1843 he joined the seventh artillery brigade in Cologne as a flag squadron officer. After three years of military service, however, he went to the stage, following his youthful inclination. He had his first appearance at the court theatre in Neu-Strelitz on 8 November 1846. Two years later, he joined the Burgtheater, but soon he left the theatre to work in Leipzig, Weimar, Pest, Mannheim (1856-1860), Karlsruhe, Darmstadt, Dessau etc. In 1864, Deetz took over the \\"Deutsche Oper\\" in Amsterdam, where he achieved artistic successes and performed Wagner and Gounod for the first time. In 1873, he was engaged at the Royal Theatre in Berlin, where he made his debut as \\"Königsleutnant\\" and \\"Odoardo\\". Only one year later, he was appointed as a director and in 1877 he became artistic director. In this year, Deetz, who first appeared in the heroic fathers and rhetorical character roles, decided to become an actor. As \\"Chorführer Cajetan\\" he appeared in public for the last time on 3 June 1878. He was a popular tasteful actor, who took his art very seriously. Faust, Nathan, Tell, Wallenstein, King's Lieutenant, Götz etc. belonged to his best roles.

It is part of the collection at the British Museum in London. The Rondanini Faun was built on an ancient torso, completed by Duquesnoy between 1625 and 1630. Duquesnoy's completion of antiques was acclaimed in Rome as 'absolutely perfect.' In 17th-century restoration of antique statues, the latter were often imbued with Baroque style by the contemporary sculptor who completed the opus. Albeit not excessively so, the Rondanini is no exception, its broad movement being proof thereof. Duquesnoy is known to have produced at least the limbs and the head for this figure, completing a severed torso with a faun tail. Duquesnoy's Faun takes its name from the Palazzo Rondanini in Rome, where it was once kept. Sculpture Rondanini Faun, head, detail The restored statue was attributed to Duquesnoy by the latter's biographer, Giovanni Pietro Bellori. Duquesnoy's pupil, Orfeo Boselli, attributed the statue to the Fiammingo. In his Osservazioni, in the chapter treating restoration, Boselli cited the Rondanini Faun as proof of Duquesnoy's skills in the practice. As reported by Estelle Lingo \\"Boselli described the figure as leaping, and the [Rondanini Faun] is indeed represented in mid action, up on the toes of his right foot with his left foot lifted, both arms extended and head raised, as if he had just leapt and struck the cymbals he is holding.\\" The broad movement of the faun is sign of the Baroque influence in Duquesnoy's day, an admirer of la maniere greca, who in this instance (the restoration of a sculpture ancient per se) nonetheless allowed Baroque influence to permeate the statue. Duquesnoy provided at least the head and the limbs for this sculpture, originally a severed torso with a faun tail. The upper limbs are what conveys the broad movement of the figure. The Fiammingo completed this oeuvre for Alessandro Rondanini, and in fact the sculpture take its name from the Palazzo Rondanini in Rome.

It marks the site of the burial of an unknown 18-year-old girl who died on the island in 1914 after falling from a cliff while fleeing from British forces who sought to detain a number of German nationals then resident on the island. Her body was recovered and interred in an urn on the site by Chinese workers, and a makeshift shrine structure was built. The site was visited frequently by gamblers who thought the spirit of the girl would bring them good luck. A permanent structure was erected in 1974 by a company carrying out quarrying on the island. Quarrying has since ceased, and the shrine is now within Ketam Mountain Bike Park. Visitors often leave offerings, including makeup and Barbie dolls, at the site.  Background  In the 1910s, the island of Pulau Ubin in the British Crown Colony of Singapore was home to two German families (the Brandts and Muhlingans) who ran coffee plantations. The island was also a key source of granite used in the construction of buildings and infrastructure on the Singapore mainland and was home to a number of quarries. The outbreak of the First World War, in which Germany was in conflict with Britain, in July 1914 led the British to detain German nationals on security grounds. A British military force was sent to Pulau Ubin to detain the Germans but the 18-year- old daughter of one of the families fled from the British forces into a wooded area. A number of days later her body, covered by ants, was discovered by Boyanese plantation workers; the girl had died after falling down a cliff near to a quarry. The workers covered the body with sand, laid down flowers and lit incense before offering prayers for the girl, whose name is not known.  Shrine  Chinese workers later recovered the body and buried the girl at the crest of a hill above the quarry. She was interred in an urn together with a crucifix (the girl was Roman Catholic) and a number of coins. A makeshift shrine was constructed over the grave which became associated with good luck. Gamblers from Singapore and the Malay peninsula visited the shrine to make offerings in the hope that the spirit of the German Girl would bless them with good fortune. In 1974 a quarrying company constructed a more permanent shrine, described as \\"a small yellow Chinese temple\\", on the site. It is believed that the girl's remains were exhumed at this time and her remains placed in an urn at the site. Quarrying declined on the island from the 1970s, with the last site shutting in 1999. The number of residents dropped from around 2,000 to fewer than 100 and the island became a refuge for wildlife. The shrine, in the south-west of the island, is now located within Ketam Mountain Bike Park. The German Girl Shrine continues to attract visitors who leave offerings of nail polish, perfume, makeup and Barbie dolls for the spirit of the girl. The shrine has been adorned with Christmas decorations. The shrine, which attracts an average of four to five visitors a week, was renovated in February 2015.

Here, they were sold to European planters and forced to work on the plantations. Around a third of these transported Africans were relocated in the Caribbean, with under 700,000 being settled in Jamaica. In 1834, slavery in Jamaica was abolished after the British government passed the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. Racial prejudice nevertheless remained prevalent across Jamaican society. The overwhelming majority of Jamaica's legislative council was white throughout the 19th century, and those of African descent were treated as second-class citizens. Christian Revivalism was a key influence on Rastafari. Many Afro-Jamaicans joined Christian churches during the Great Revival of 1860–61. They brought with them many inherited African beliefs and rituals, which they syncretised with Christianity in various ways. Some of the new religions that emerged, such as Kumina, remained heavily based on traditional African religion, while others, such as Revival Zion, were more fully Christian. The majority of these groups practiced spiritual healing and incorporated drumming and chanting, counselling, and spirit possession into their structures. Increasing numbers of Pentecostal missionaries from the United States arrived in Jamaica during the early 20th century, this migration reaching a climax in the 1920s. They provided a way for Afro-Jamaicans—who continued to live with the social memory of enslavement and who were denied any substantial participation in Jamaica's political institutions—to express their hopes, fears, and aspirations. Ethiopianism, Back to Africa, and Marcus Garvey Marcus Garvey, a prominent black nationalist theorist who heavily influenced Rastafari and is regarded as a prophet by many Rastas According to Edmonds, Rastafari emerged from \\"the convergence of several religious, cultural, and intellectual streams\\", while fellow scholar Wigmoore Francis described it as owing much of its self- understanding to \\"intellectual and conceptual frameworks\\" dating from the 19th and early 20th centuries. Both Ethiopianism and the Back to Africa ethos, traditions with 18th century roots, constituted \\"fundamental ingredients of Rastafarian ideology\\". In the 19th century, there were growing calls for the African diaspora located in Western Europe and the Americas to be resettled in Africa. In that century, many members of the African diaspora moved to colonies founded in Sierra Leone and Liberia. Based in Liberia, the black Christian preacher Edward Wilmot Blyden began promoting African pride and the preservation of African tradition, customs, and institutions. Blyden sought to promote a form of Christianity that was suited to the African context and believed that black people had to acquire their own historical knowledge about themselves. The idea of the African diaspora's return to Africa was later given impetus by the creation of the State of Israel in 1948 as a nation-state for the Jewish diaspora to return to. Also spreading throughout Africa was Ethiopianism, a movement that accorded special status to the east African nation of Ethiopia because it was mentioned in various Biblical passages. For adherents of Ethiopianism, \\"Ethiopia\\" was regarded as a synonym of Africa as a whole. Across the continent, although particularly in South Africa, Christian churches were established that referred to themselves as \\"Ethiopian\\"; these groups were at the forefront of the burgeoning African nationalist movement that sought liberation from European colonial rule. Of significant influence on Rastafari was the Jamaican-born activist Marcus Garvey, who spent much of his adult life in the US and Britain. Garvey supported the idea of global racial separatism and rejected the idea that black people of African descent living in the Americas should campaign for their civil rights; instead he believed that they should migrate en masse back to Africa. His ideas were opposed by many blacks in the Americas and he experienced hostility from African-American civil rights activists like W. E. B. Du Bois. He also faced opposition from the Liberian government, which did not want millions of unskilled migrants arriving on its shores. As a mass movement, Garveyism declined in the Great Depression of the 1930s. A rumour later spread that in 1916, Garvey had called on his supporters to \\"look to Africa\\" for the crowning of a black king; this quote was never verified. However, in August 1930 a play that Garvey had written, Coronation of an African King, was performed in Kingston's Edelweiss Park. Its plot revolved around the crowning of the fictional Prince Cudjoe of Sudan, although it anticipated the crowning of Haile Selassie later that year. Garvey would become critical of Haile Selassie for leaving Ethiopia during the Italian occupation, describing the king as \\"a great coward\\" who rules a \\"country where black men are chained and flogged.\\" Rastafari does not promote all of the views that Garvey espoused, but nevertheless shares many of the same perspectives. Rastas hold Garvey in great esteem, with many regarding him as a prophet. According to Soumahoro, Rastafari \\"emerged from the socio-political ferment inaugurated by Marcus Garvey\\", while for Cashmore, Garvey was the \\"most important\\" precursor of Rastafari. Garvey knew of the Rastas but his view of them, according to the scholar Barry Chevannes, \\"bordered on scorn\\". According to Chevannes, Garvey would have regarded the Rastas' belief in the divinity of Haile Selassie as blasphemy. Haile Selassie and the early Rastas: 1930–1949 Haile Selassie was crowned Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930. A number of Jamaica's Christian clergymen claimed that Selassie's coronation was evidence that he was the black messiah that they believed was prophesied in the Book of Revelation (5:2–5; 19:16), the Book of Daniel (7:3), and the Book of Psalms (68:31). Over the following years, several street preachers—most notably Leonard Howell, Archibald Dunkley, Robert Hinds, and Joseph Hibbert—began promoting the doctrine that Haile Selassie was the returned Jesus. They first did so in Kingston, and soon the message spread throughout 1930s Jamaica, especially among poor communities who were hit particularly hard by the Great Depression. Clarke stated that \\"to all intents and purposes this was the beginning\\" of the Rastafari movement. Emperor Haile Selassie in 1942, a year after he re-took control of Ethiopia Howell has been described as the \\"leading figure\\" in the early Rastafari movement. He preached that black Africans were superior to white Europeans and that Afro-Jamaicans should owe their allegiance to Haile Selassie rather than to George V, King of Great Britain and Ireland. The island's British authorities arrested him and charged him with sedition in 1934, resulting in his two-year imprisonment. Following his release, Howell established the Ethiopian Salvation Society and in 1939 established a Rasta community known as Pinnacle, in Saint Catherine Parish. Attracting between 500 and 2000 people, his community became largely self-sufficient. Police feared that Howell was training his followers for an armed rebellion and were angered that it was producing cannabis for sale. They raided the community on several occasions and Howell was imprisoned for a further two years. Upon his release he returned to Pinnacle, but the police continued with their raids and shut down the community in 1954; Howell himself was committed to a mental hospital. In 1936, Italy invaded and occupied Ethiopia, and Haile Selassie went into exile. The invasion brought international condemnation and led to growing sympathy for the Ethiopian cause. In 1937, Selassie created the Ethiopian World Federation, which established a branch in Jamaica later that decade. In 1941, the British drove the Italians out of Ethiopia and Selassie returned to reclaim his throne. Many Rastas interpreted this as the fulfilment of a prophecy made in the Book of Revelation (19:11–19). Growing visibility: 1950–1969 Rastafari's main appeal was among the lower classes of Jamaican society. For its first thirty years, Rastafari was in a conflictual relationship with the Jamaican authorities. Jamaica's Rastas expressed contempt for many aspects of the island's society, viewing the government, police, bureaucracy, professional classes, and established churches as instruments of Babylon. Relations between practitioners and the police were strained, with Rastas often being arrested for cannabis possession. During the 1950s the movement grew rapidly in Jamaica itself and also spread to other Caribbean islands, the United States, and the United Kingdom. In the 1940s and 1950s, a more militant brand of Rastafari emerged. The vanguard of this was the House of Youth Black Faith, a group whose members were largely based in West Kingston. Backlash against the Rastas grew after a practitioner of the religion allegedly killed a woman in 1957. In March 1958, the first Rastafarian Universal Convention was held in Back-o-Wall, Kingston. Following the event, militant Rastas unsuccessfully tried to capture the city in the name of Haile Selassie. Later that year they tried again in Spanish Town. The increasing militancy of some Rastas resulted in growing alarm about the religion in Jamaica. According to Cashmore, the Rastas became \\"folk devils\\" in Jamaican society. In 1959, the self-declared prophet and founder of the African Reform Church, Claudius Henry, sold thousands of tickets to Afro- Jamaicans, including many Rastas, for passage on a ship that he claimed would take them to Africa. The ship never arrived and Henry was charged with fraud. In 1960 he was sentenced to six years imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the government. Henry's son was accused of being part of a paramilitary cell and executed, confirming public fears about Rasta violence. One of the most prominent clashes between Rastas and law enforcement was the Coral Gardens incident of 1963, in which an initial skirmish between police and Rastas resulted in several deaths and led to a larger roundup of practitioners. Clamping down on the Rasta movement, in 1964 the island's government implemented tougher laws surrounding cannabis use. At the invitation of Jamaica's government, Haile Selassie visited the island for the first time on 21 April 1966, with thousands of Rastas assembled in the crowd waiting to meet him at the airport. The event was the high point of their discipleship for many of the religion's members. Over the course of the 1960s, Jamaica's Rasta community underwent a process of routinisation, with the late 1960s witnessing the launch of the first official Rastafarian newspaper, the Rastafarian Movement Association's Rasta Voice. The decade also saw Rastafari develop in increasingly complex ways, as it did when some Rastas began to reinterpret the idea that salvation required a physical return to Africa, instead interpreting salvation as coming through a process of mental decolonisation that embraced African approaches to life. Whereas its membership had previously derived predominantly from poorer sectors of society, in the 1960s Rastafari began attracting support from more privileged groups like students and professional musicians. The foremost group emphasising this approach was the Twelve Tribes of Israel, whose members came to be known as \\"Uptown Rastas\\". Among those attracted to Rastafari in this decade were middle-class intellectuals like Leahcim Semaj, who called for the religious community to place greater emphasis on scholarly social theory as a method of achieving change. Although some Jamaican Rastas were critical of him, many came under the influence of the Guyanese black nationalist academic Walter Rodney, who lectured to their community in 1968 before publishing his thoughts as the pamphlet Groundings. Like Rodney, many Jamaican Rastas were influenced by the U.S.-based Black Power movement. After Black Power declined following the deaths of prominent exponents such as Malcolm X, Michael X, and George Jackson, Rastafari filled the vacuum it left for many black youth. International spread and decline: 1970–present In the mid-1970s, reggae's international popularity exploded. The most successful reggae artist was Bob Marley, who—according to Cashmore—\\"more than any other individual, was responsible for introducing Rastafarian themes, concepts and demands to a truly universal audience\\". Reggae's popularity led to a growth in \\"pseudo-Rastafarians\\", individuals who listened to reggae and wore Rasta clothing but did not share its belief system. Many Rastas were angered by this, believing it commercialised their religion. Reggae musician Bob Marley did much to raise international awareness of the Rastafari movement in the 1970s. Through reggae, Rasta musicians became increasingly important in Jamaica's political life during the 1970s. To bolster his popularity with the electorate, Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley employed Rasta imagery and courted and obtained support from Marley and other reggae musicians. Manley described Rastas as a \\"beautiful and remarkable people\\" and carried a cane, the \\"rod of correction\\", which he claimed was a gift from Haile Selassie. Following Manley's example, Jamaican political parties increasingly employed Rasta language, symbols, and reggae references in their campaigns, while Rasta symbols became increasingly mainstream in Jamaican society. This helped to confer greater legitimacy on Rastafari, with reggae and Rasta imagery being increasingly presented as a core part of Jamaica's cultural heritage for the growing tourist industry. In the 1980s, a Rasta, Barbara Makeda Blake Hannah, became a senator in the Jamaican Parliament. Enthusiasm for Rastafari was likely dampened by the death of Haile Selassie in 1975 and that of Marley in 1981. During the 1980s, the number of Rastas in Jamaica declined, with Pentecostal and other Charismatic Christian groups proving more successful at attracting young recruits. Several publicly prominent Rastas converted to Christianity, and two of those who did so—Judy Mowatt and Tommy Cowan—maintained that Marley had converted from Rastafari to Christianity, in the form of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, during his final days. The significance of Rastafari messages in reggae also declined with the growing popularity of dancehall, a Jamaican musical genre that typically foregrounded lyrical themes of hyper-masculinity, violence, and sexual activity rather than religious symbolism. The mid-1990s saw a revival of Rastafari-focused reggae associated with musicians like Anthony B, Buju Banton, Luciano, Sizzla, and Capleton. From the 1990s, Jamaica also witnessed the growth of organised political activity within the Rasta community, seen for instance through campaigns for the legalisation of cannabis and the creation of political parties like the Jamaican Alliance Movement and the Imperial Ethiopian World Federation Incorporated Political Party, none of which attained more than minimal electoral support. In 1995, the Rastafari Centralization Organization was established in Jamaica as an attempt to organise the Rastafari community.

It was established by upgrading the 1794 established old College of Engineering, Guindy campus to an university on 16 September 2020 based on a new bill passed in the Tamil Nadu legislative assembly carved out the earlier Anna University. ATRU comprises of the College of Engineering, Guindy; Alagappa College of Technology, School of Architecture and Planning, and the Madras Institute of Technology campus is located in Chromepet. All together it's now known as ATRU Chennai, Guindy campus and ATRU Chennai, Chromepet Campus. History Statue of C N Annadurai in College of Engineering, Guindy campus The Government of Tamil Nadu, upgraded the grand old 1794 College of Engineering, Guindy to the Anna Technological and Research University on 16 September 2020. The new university was formed from the erstwhile Anna University main campus engineering and technology institutes and consists of four institutes: the renowned College of Engineering, Guindy, the Alagappa College of Technology, the Anna University School of Architecture and Planning and the Madras Institute of Technology. The first version of Anna University formed in 1978 had a similar constitution as the current structure of Anna Technological and Research University before various governments repeatedly kept changing the varsity's structure and affiliation scope. In 2001, under the Anna University Amendment Act of 2001, the erstwhile Anna University became an affiliating university, taking under its wings all the engineering colleges in Tamil Nadu. This included six government engineering colleges, three government-aided private institutions, and 426 self-financing colleges. On 1 February 2007, as a result of a Government of Tamil Nadu decision, the university was split into six constituent universities: Anna University, Chennai, Anna University of Technology, Chennai, Anna University of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, Anna University of Technology, Coimbatore, Anna University of Technology Tirunelveli and Anna University of Technology, Madurai. The institutes were formally created in 2010. On 14 September 2011, a bill was passed to merge back the universities. The merger became final in August 2012. In 2011 and 2012 the constituents were merged back to a single affiliating university and the four regional universities continue to function as regional campus of the university. And then in September 2020, the Tamil Nadu government passed a bill making the varsity's four campuses in Chennai to be constituted as a 'unitary type' institution and called 'Anna Technological and Research University' while a new affiliating type university called 'Anna University' will be constituted to manage the affairs of the constituent and affiliated colleges. The subsequent new Acts will be called Anna University (Amendment) Act 2020 and Anna Technological and Research University Act 1978. The new Act will come into force after the state government issues a notification. Academics The university offers courses in engineering and technology through its affiliated colleges and follows a dual semester system. Every year the university conducts examinations for even semester in May–June and for odd semester in November–December. The first semester students have exams in January. Affiliated colleges The university's campus is in Chennai and extends over 185 acres adjoining the Adyar River and the Raj Bhavan. It houses College of Engineering, Guindy, Alagappa College of Technology, School of Architecture and Planning, three technical departments of the University of Madras.

It is located along the Riihimäki–Lahti line, and its neighboring stations are Järvelä in the west and Lahti in the east.  History  Herrala is the one of the original intermediate stations of the Riihimäki–Saint Petersburg railway, and was opened for passenger traffic in November 1869. The station was placed in the crossroads between the railway and the road from Hollola to Mäntsälä and Orimattila. Its Class IV station building was built according to plans from Knut Nylander; it was later demolished and replaced with a new one in 1953. The later station building is distinctive in that while most of the stations of the era were built out of wood and with simple architechtural principles, Herrala was given an elaborate two-level brick building. The station played a role in the development of Herrala, and the village became home to various industries, including three brick factories, the last of which closed down in 1976. A sawmill was also founded; its activities ceased following a destructive fire in May 2017.Yle.fi: 114-vuotiaan sahan tuotanto katkesi tuhoisaan tulipaloon – \\"Ne ovat nyt kaikki mennyttä, savuna ilmaan\\" Herrala has slowly lost its significance as an urban center, partly due to the development in the municipality of Hollola being focused in the seat of Salpakangas. Freight transport at the station was ceased in 1990 and its railyard was disassembled in 1997.

They evolved from narrow windows filled with a mosaic of deeply- coloured pieces of glass into gigantic windows that filled entire walls, with a full range of colours and more naturalistic figures. In later windows, the figures were often coloured with silver stain, enamel paints and flashed glass. Later windows used large areas of white glass, or grisaille, to bring more light into the interiors. English Gothic windows followed roughly the same evolution of styles as English architecture: they followed windows in the Norman or Romanesque style, beginning in the late 12th century. somewhat later than in France. In the 13th century, the Decorated style appeared, which was divided into two periods: the later being the more ornate curvilinear. The next and last period was the Perpendicular Gothic, which lasted well into the 16th century, longer than in continental Europe. Much of the original glass was destroyed in the English Reformation, and has been replaced with modern work. However, examples of original glass are found in Canterbury Cathedral, Wells Cathedral, York Minster and Westminster Abbey.

File:England YorkMinster JesseTree c1170.JPGPortion of a Tree of Jesse window, York Minster (late 12th-early 13th c.) The primary characteristics of early English glass are deep rich colours, particularly deep blues and ruby reds, often with a streaky and uneven colour, which adds to their appeal; their mosaic quality, being composed of an assembly of small pieces; the importance of the iron work, which becomes part of the design; and the simple and bold style of the painting of faces and details. All of the effects of the image are created by the colours of the pieces of glass. A single medallion at Canterbury Cathedral depicting Noah's Ark, no larger than a square foot (0.1m2), contains more than fifty pieces of glass, of blue, greenish-blue, green, and bits of white glass for the foam of the sea. A second important feature was the iron work. In early windows, before the introduction of stone tracery, the leaded panels of glass were inserted into an iron lattice or framework of upright and horizontal bars forming squares. The framework became a part of the design. In some cases, such as the upper windows, the figures were so large that they filled they whole window. In the lower windows, closer to the eye, each square space was filled with a single subject or image, usually framed by a circle. This was called a medallion window. The details of the early windows were added by painting in brown enamel, which was then fired onto the glass. Lettering and patterns were scratched out of the glass; there was no modelling of light and shade. In the later 13th century the windows gradually became more pictorial, more refined and mannerist, following the example of illuminated manuscripts. They took advantage of the delicate patterns of the tracery in the windows, added decorative illustrations in the margins, and often placed the central figures beneath elaborate arches and canopies. Grisaille windows became more popular in the 13th century, because they allowed in more light. They were often decorated with floral motifs, such as cherry blossoms and ivy, in the borders. A famous set of these windows is found at Merton College, Oxford, from the end of the 13th or beginning of the 14th century. They portray the Apostles, and also the donor of the window, Henry de Maunsfeld, who appears in some twenty medallions. = History = File:Canterbury Cathedral 010 Window with St Thomas of Canterbury.JPGThomas Becket window at Canterbury Cathedral (13th c.)

File:Merton College, Oxford (3916031728).jpgGrisaille window at Merton College, Oxford (13th c.) The Gothic style in stained glass had first appeared in France in 1142, with the dedication of the stained glass windows in the ambulatory of the Basilica of Saint Denis. The earliest existing windows in the style in England are probably those at Canterbury Cathedral, including the Methuselah window in the choir clerestory. The choir of Canterbury was destroyed by a fire and was rebuilt by William of Sens, a French master-mason from Sens, introducing the French Gothic style to England. The best-preserved is the east window in the part of the chapel called \\"Becket's Crown\\", in which only four or five of the twenty-four medallions are later copies. The Thomas Becket window features a decorative border in a repeat geometric pattern called a \\"mosaic diaper\\", which became a common feature of English windows in this period. Another novel feature of this window is a background of blue enamel painted on the glass, then scratched out to form a diaper pattern. This also became a common feature of later English windows. The Thomas Becket Window at Canterbury bears a striking resemblance to the Thomas Becket window in Sens Cathedral in France, where Becket spent his exile, and the home of William of Sens, the architect of the remodelling of Canterbury. The two windows were likely made by the same craftsmen. During English Civil War in 1642-43, Puritan iconoclasts attacked the windows throughout the cathedral, climbing ladders and swinging pikes to smash the glass, which they considered to be idolatrous. However, four of the windows of Trinity Chapel still have most of their original glass, and the others were restored in the 19th century with imitations of the old glass. Another important 13th century window is the \\"Five Sisters\\" window at York Minster (about 1260), notable especially for its large size and density of images. The popular name was given to the window by Charles Dickens. Another collection of early windows is found in the Jerusalem Chamber of Westminster Abbey, built by Henry III of England, the brother-in-law of Louis IX of France, the creator of Sainte-Chapelle. Unfortunately only a small number of original medallions remain.  14th century: Decorated style  The 14th century saw a major change in the style and technique of English windows. It was brought about in part by changes in the architecture of English cathedrals and churches, and also by technical innovations, such as the use of silver stain to colour the glass. It corresponded roughly with the English architectural style called Decorated, which in turn was divided into two periods: the earlier Geometric, in which tracery usually featured straight lines, cubes and circles; and the later Curvilinear whose tracery used gracefully curving lines. The later part of the 14th century, after about 1360, saw the arrival in England of Perpendicular Gothic. It brought a continual reduction in the amount of coloured space in the windows, and more and more grisaille. The number of lancets increased, and the number of small windows over the lancets grew, filling the wall space. = Characteristics = File:Wells Cathedral, Stained glass window (34154406365).jpgResurrection scene from Wells Cathedral (early 14th c.)

File:Wells06,Cathedral detail.JPGThe East window of Wells Cathedral (14th c.) File:Stained glass, St. Mary, Deerhurst.jpgDeerhurst Priory, Gloucester, Saint Catherine (left) (beginning of 14th c.) and St. Alphege of Canterbury (right) (early 15th century) English cathedrals were expanded with greater numbers of small chapels, each of which required more light. This meant that windows could no longer be composed entirely of a mosaic of small circular medallions of deep, rich colours, as in the 12th and 13th centuries. Each bay had a group of tall, narrow lancet windows, usually topped by several small circular or clover-like windows. Each lancet, instead of having a multitude of small figures in medallions, had a single major figure in each section, usually a saint or apostle, in coloured glass, surrounded and set off by delicate patterns of white or lightly-tinted glass. The edges were often decorated with designs of flowers, ivy, and other plants, or geometric borders, and the tops and bottoms of the windows were decorated with birds, angels and grotesques. The glass at the top of the window was often also filled with painted architectural detail, such as arches, pinnacles and canopies, which harmonised with the architecture of the church itself. The figures in the windows showed the influence of medieval manuscripts; the poses were more natural. The 14th century glass also showed technical improvement; thanks to the use of better quality sand and other ingredients, and improved techniques of heating and forming the glass, it was thinner, clearer, and more consistent in colour. It lost much of the smoky and streaked appearance which had given charm to the early Gothic glass. A major change in the 14th century glass was a great reduction in the number of pieces of glass in a single window, which gave it a mosaic appearance. This was made possible by a technique called silver stain, which added a very thin coat of glass mixed with silver compounds, particularly silver nitrate, which was baked onto the outside of the window. Depending upon the formula used, this produced a light yellow, orange or green, which could be very bright, or, in flashed glass, could be scratched to produce more subtle tones and shading. The Perpendicular style in glass was characterised not just by vertical lines, but also by colour and the distribution of the glass. The blue and ruby backgrounds went up the entire height of each alternate section. The blue is lighter and greyer than in Decorated glass. White became more predominant, especially in figures, which were just touched with yellow stain. = History = File:Wells Cathedral HDR photo (2264401553) Golden window crop.jpgThe Tree of Jesse or \\"Golden Window\\" on the west of Wells Cathedral (1340-45), using silver stain for its golden colour File:King Ine in the Transfiguration Window of Wells Cathedral.jpgDetail of King Ine, Wells Cathedral (14th c.) File:Wells Cathedral (glass).jpgDetail of Lady Chapel windows, Wells Cathedral The first use of silver stain in England was at York Minster in about 1309, and by the end of the century it was very widely used in English workshops, and gradually changed the nature of English windows. However, in English windows, the painting was often subtle. The most elaborate decoration was not in the painted glass, but in the tracery, in the stone mullions and iron bars that formed the framework for the window. Examples included the west window of York Minster, whose glass was Decorated curvilinear, but whose tracery, especially at the top of the window, resembled that of the later French Flamboyant style. The curling form at the top gave the window the nickname \\"The Heart of Yorkshire\\". Other important examples of the Decorated style are the Tree of Jesse Window, or \\"Golden Window\\", coloured with silver stain, in Wells Cathedral (c. 1345). Others include the windows of the choir of the Chapel of Merton College at Oxford, donated by Henry de Mamesfeld. Oxford Cathedral and the Abbey Church of Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire contain early white windows painted with silver stain. = Rose windows = File:06-Lincoln-054.jpgThe Dean's Eye, Lincoln Cathedral (completed 1235) File:Lincoln Cathedral, Dean's Eye window, N31 Detail (44825300291).jpgDetail of the Dean's Eye Window File:Bishops Eye window, Lincoln Cathedral (12138820365).jpgThe Bishops's Eye, Lincoln Cathedral, in Decorated curvilinear style (completed 1330) File:Detail of Bishop's Eye Rose Window.jpgDetail of the Bishops's Eye window Rose windows were rare in English Gothic cathedrals, but Lincoln Cathedral produced two fine examples: the Dean's Eye in the north transept and the Bishop's Eye in the south transept. The Dean's Eye was begun by the French- born Bishop, Saint Hugh of Lincoln, in the Early Gothic period in 1192, and was completed in 1235. The Bishops's Eye was not completed until a century later, in 1330, in the Decorated curvilinear style.  15th to early 16th century: Perpendicular and International Gothic  = Characteristics = File:King's College Chapel, Cambridge - The Great East Window.jpgGreat East Window, King's College Chapel, Oxford File:Merton College, Oxford (3916031130).jpgWindow of Merton College, Oxford, showing the dominance of white. File:York Minster, Great East Window.jpgPerpendicular Great East window of York Minster File:York Minster - The Fall.jpgDetail from the Great East Window, \\"Adam and Eve, the Fall from Grace\\" (1405-08) Through the use of painting, silver stain and flashed glass, figures became more naturalistic, with shading and more details. The complex bays and vaults of Perpendicular architecture, with multiple decorative colonettes, ribs and openwork decoration spreading upwards and across the vaults, influenced the style. It encouraged the use of windows depicting hosts of angels in the upper windows. In the windows, heraldry and coats of arms of wealthy clients replaced portraits of the donors. The use of pale backgrounds continued, particularly panels of white delicately decorated with flowers, animals and coats of arms, which surrounded and set off the more colourful main figures. In the second half of the 15th century, the early tradition of surrounding figures with painted architectural features in the windows became less frequent, and figures began to appear against more varied backgrounds, such as landscapes. Improvements in the techniques of painting on the glass in vitreous enamel accelerated the tendency toward realism and a painterly style. The designs in the English windows became more intimate and anecdotal. During the late Gothic, the problem was sometimes not how to bring more light into the deeply coloured windows, but how to bring more colour into the pale white windows. Even the flesh of the figures was usually white. In a 15th century window, it was rare that more than one-fourth of the area was composed of coloured glass. To add more colour, sometimes light colour was added to the background. Colourful figures occupied windows of the south transept window at York Minister, surrounded by delicately-coloured quarries, or panels, rather than a white background. Additional colour was brought in by adding touches of gold (made with silver stain) to the painted architectural canopies, pinnacles and crockets around and above the figures. The Perpendicular style called for figures that were longer, to fill the tall, narrow windows. In the windows of All Souls College, the figures occupied about one-half of the length of the window. The space above the figure was filled with painted architectural detail. The faces in Late Gothic were more finely drawn than in earlier styles, a development influenced by Flemish painting. = History = File:OxfordCathedral Glass2.JPGDebut of Renaissance stained glass, from Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford (1516-1526) File:Oxford cathedral, vetrata di giona di abraham van linge, 1630.JPGRenaissance window at Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford by Abraham van Linge (17th century) The International Gothic style, which appeared in the first half of the 15th century, was the final form of European Gothic, which borrowed from French, Dutch and German artists, and influenced the English style. German engraving and Flemish painting of the period had a particular influence on stained glass, not only in England but across Europe. The English perpendicular style was the other major influence. New glass production was abundant, despite the War of the Roses. English glass craftsmen established important workshops in York, Norwich, and Oxford, which served clients in the surrounding regions. These clients included not only cathedrals and nobles, but also wealthy merchants and landowners who wanted impressive windows for their new residences. Glaziers developed personal styles, and their names became known. Examples were Thomas of Oxford, who made the windows of the Chapel of William of Wykeham's College at Winchester, and William of Conventry, the glazier of the Great East Window at York Minster (1405-1408). Another example was John Prudde, the King's glazier, who made the glass for Beauchamp Chapel of Saint Mary's at Warwick, which was commissioned in 1447. Other important examples of the new style were the East window of the Priory of Great Malvern in Worcestershire (1423-39), and the windows of the chapel of All Souls' College at Oxford (1441-47). Another important influence was from Flemish painting. England developed close trade and political links with Flanders, and Flemish glaziers began to arrive in England, causing some disputes with the London Guild of Glaziers. Several important English works, such as windows at Fairfield Church in Gloucestershire and at King's College Chapel, Cambridge, were probably by Flemish artists, such as Dirk Vallet. By the early 17th century, the art of English Gothic windows was in its final decline. Some of the last windows, such as those by Abraham Van Linge at Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, were simply like large paintings viewed through a grid of lead lines. The dividing line between Gothic stained glass art and Renaissance glass is traditionally placed at about 1530. The first important group of Renaissance windows in England was commissioned between 1516 and 1526 and installed at King's College Chapel, Cambridge.

VRI is mostly known for its association football department, which competes in the Denmark Series, the fourth tier of the Danish football league system. Founded in 1937, it is affiliated to the regional DBU Jutland football association. The team plays its home matches at NES Park where it has been based since 2011.  History  The club was founded on 9 November 1937. The initiators were Frode Nielsen and Gunnar Åse Nielsen, who established the club at a meeting held at Risskov Badehotel, where 70 new members joined the club. Frode Nielsen, who became chairman, Gunnar Nielsen, Erling Nielsen, S. Blinkenberg and Søren Andersen were elected to the first board. Initially, the club mostly focused on handball, but the club included football in its program from 1938. The first training grounds were located at the current Bellevuehal, while indoor training took place in Stadionhallen. In 1952, the club was allocated a clubhouse adjacent to Bellevue Beach. Bellevuehallen, the club's new indoor arena, was inaugurated on 19 June 1966, with the addition of another new indoor arena in 1987. Each year in December, VRI hosts an indoor football tournament in Bellevuehallerne to find the \\"Aarhus Champions in Indoor Football\\" between selected teams from AGF, Aarhus Fremad, VSK Aarhus and VRI. On 20 November 2011, the club inaugurated its new home ground, NES Park, with a pitch consisting of artificial turf. Present at the inauguration were local Aarhus players Martin Jørgensen and Peter Graulund, as well as former VRI player Mikkel Kirkeskov. The football department has mostly spent its existence in the lower tiers of the Danish football league system, bouncing between the fifth tier Jutland Series and lower regional tiers. Its best historical achievement was long regarded to be the 1969 promotion to the fourth-tier Denmark Series, with the club almost reaching the third tier 3rd Division in 1971. In 2019, VRI repeated the feat from 1969 and won promotion to the Denmark Series after a 3-0 win over Agerbæk/Starup in the third to last round.

He served in the Indonesian Army, primarily in Kodam III/Siliwangi, before he was appointed minister under Sukarno in 1958. He served as ministers of production, and later minister of public works, until 1966. Afterwards, he chaired the Audit Board of Indonesia for a time before participating and leading sports organizations in Indonesia, including heading the National Sports Committee of Indonesia and representing the country in the International Olympic Committee. Early life and education Suprayogi was born in Bandung on 12 April 1914. He studied at a Middelbare Handelsschool (equivalent of a high school) there, majoring in economics. Career =Early and military career= He began working as a clerk at Bandung's municipal government in 1935 until the Japanese takeover in 1942, during which he was promoted to financial inspector for the city. After the Japanese surrender, he joined the newly formed People's Security Agency (BKR) as part of its local leadership in Bandung. During the Indonesian National Revolution, he was part of the Siliwangi Division which largely operated in Western Java, where he held various positions including chief of logistics and special chief of staff. After the war ended, he served in several other positions in the army, until he was the army's quartermaster general by 1955. As a lieutenant colonel, he was appointed as Siliwangi's commander-in-chief in August 1956, replacing Alexander Evert Kawilarang. Many officers of Siliwangi at that time was considering launching a coup against the government in order to \\"improve the affairs of state\\", and one of Suprayogi's first actions was to gather regimental and battalion officers to convince them against backing such coups in late September 1955. A number of Siliwangi officers, namely Kemal Idris, were later removed by Suprayogi as they made a continued futile attempt to gather support for a coup, including leading a regiment to head towards Jakarta before they were intercepted by other Siliwangi units and was forced to turn back without a fight. =Government minister= His first ministerial appointment was in 25 June 1958 while he held the rank of colonel, as State Minister for Economic Stabilization in the Djuanda Cabinet. In the succeeding First Working Cabinet, he was appointed a full Minister of Production, and in the Second Working Cabinet he had been promoted to brigadier general while maintaining his ministerial post. The Third Working Cabinet saw Suprayogi's office being elevated to Coordinating Minister, at a time when he had been promoted to major general. He also held a secondary office as Minister of Public Works and Power in the Third Working Cabinet. During Suprayogi's tenure as public works minister, he oversaw several large-scale projects such as the construction of the Jatiluhur Dam, the Ngurah Rai Airport, the Ampera Bridge, and construction in Jakarta related to the 1962 Asian Games (such as the Semanggi Interchange and the Senayan Sports Complex). In the Fourth Working Cabinet, Suprayogi would no longer serve as coordinating minister, though Suprayogi remained public works minister. He maintained his office in the Dwikora Cabinet, but was replaced by in the Revised Dwikora Cabinet. Suprayogi was appointed chairman of the Audit Board of Indonesia (BPK) in 1966. The Audit Board had previously been largely ineffective under Sukarno's presidency due to presidential control, and it did not begin investigating smaller cases of corruption until 1967. He remained chairman until his replacement by Umar Wirahadikusumah in 1973. =Sports organizations= During his tenure as minister of production, he was also chairman of the Swimming Association of Indonesia (PRSI) and within this capacity Suprayogi in 1960 proposed a national centralized training system (Indonesian: Pelatihan Nasional, abbreviated as Pelatnas), which was implemented in the leadup to the 1962 Asian Games. This system later became the core of the Indonesian sports teams in international competitions. He would serve as PRSI's chairman between 1953 and 1983, and he was awarded the title \\"Father of Indonesian Swimming\\" during PRSI's 1983 congress. He had stated his intentions to not continue his tenure prior to the congress, as he thought he had held the position for too long. After concluding his ministerial career in the 1970s, Suprayogi became active in sports, and became daily chairman of the National Sports Committee of Indonesia (KONI), starting from an acting position in May 1973 to replace Hamengkubuwono IX who was appointed as vice president. He would serve in this position until 1986. He was also appointed to replace Hamengkubuwono as Indonesia's representative to the International Olympic Committee in 1973, and remained at the IOC until his retirement in 1989. Death He died in Jakarta on 13 September 1998 and was buried at Kalibata Heroes Cemetery. His death was caused by complications from a number of diseases he had. During his last years, he was confined to a wheelchair and had to use a walking stick, though he still made visits to athletes' training camps as late as 1997.

Just like Duquesnoy's Mercury (whose putto is now lost) the statue was designed as a dialogue between a Greek god and a putto / Cupid. The sculpture has been described as more classicist when compared to the Mercury, with Apollo's feminine facial features akin to those of Duquesnoy's Saint Susanna, and the \\"vigorously molded\\" Cupid quite close to Duquesnoy's masterpiece, the putti adorning the Tomb of Ferdinand van den Eynde. Both the Mercury and Apollo and Cupid are currently housed at the private Liechtenstein Museum in Vienna. Sculpture According to Bellori, whilst this bronze is indeed a pendant to Duquesnoy's Mercury, it was designed several years later by the Fiammingo. Indeed, the sculpture wasn't realized for Vincenzo Giustiniani (the Greek sculpture enthusiast who had commissioned the Mercury from Duquesnoy) but for another patron. Further, a different dating for the two sculptures is suggested by stylistic differences. Duquesnoy's Apollo and Cupid is first recorded in and inventory of Karl Eusebius, Prince of Liechtenstein at Feldsberg. It has been suggested that Karl Eusebius commissioned this oeuvre himself. The subject of the sculpture has been determined to be Apollo instructing Cupid how to shoot an arrow, with Cupid depicted while imitating him. The god leans on a tree stump, \\"in a graceful contrapposto that echoes that of the Mercury, but without its backward tilt.\\" Apollo originally held a bow in his left hand. With his right hand, Apollo instructs Cupid to extract a bow from his quiver. According to the Liechtenstein Museum Press, \\"Duquesnoy gave his figures a softly chased surface and a subtle modulation that creates a gentle interplay of light and shade.\\" Together with the Mercury, the bronze was greatly admired by Austrian sculptor Georg Rafael Donner, who copied Duquesnoy's bronzes. Duquesnoy's authorship was forgotten in the eighteenth century, and the work was thought to be an antique.

Drawing from the 1915 Peri and Biguet patent The TM (from , also marketed as TM Fotos and TM Metal) was a triode vacuum tube for amplification and demodulation of radio signals, manufactured in France from November 1915 to around 1935. The TM, developed for the French Army, became the standard small-signal radio tube of the Allies of World War I, and the first truly mass-produced vacuum tube. Wartime production in France is estimated at no less than 1.1 million units. Copies and derivatives of the TM were mass- produced in the United Kingdom as Type R, in the Netherlands as Type E, in the United States and in Soviet Russia as P-5 and П7.  Development  Development of the TM was initiated by colonel Gustave-Auguste Ferrié, chief of French long-distance military communications (Télégraphie Militaire). Ferrié and his closest associate Henri Abraham were well informed about American research in radio and vacuum technology. They knew that Lee de Forest's audion and the British gas-filled lamp designed by H. J. Round were too unstable and unreliable for military service, and that Irving Langmuir's pliotron was too complex and expensive for mass production. Shortly after the outbreak of World War I, a former Telefunken employee returning from the United States briefed Ferrié on the progress made in Germany and delivered samples of the latest American triodes, but again none of them met the demands of the Army. The problems were traced to insufficiently hard vacuum. Following suggestions made by Langmuire, Ferrié made a strategically correct decision to refine industrial vacuum pump technology that could guarantee sufficiently hard vacuum in mass production. The future French triode needed to be reliable, reproducible and inexpensive. In October 1914 Ferrié dispatched Abraham and Michel Peri to Grammont incandescent lamp plant in Lyon. Abraham and Peri started with copying American designs. As was expected, the audion was unreliable and unstable, the pliotron and the first three original French prototypes were too complex. By trial and error, Abraham and Peri developed a simpler and inexpensive configuration. Their fourth prototype, which had vertically placed electrode assembly, was selected for mass production and was manufactured by Grammont from February to October of 1915. This triode, known as the Abraham tube, did not pass the test of field service: many tubes were damaged during transportation. Ferrié instructed Peri to fix the problem, and two days later Peri and Jacques Biguet presented a modified design, with horizontally placed electrode assembly and the novel four-pin Type A socket (the original Abraham tube used an Edison screw with two additional flexible wires). In November 1915 the new triode was pressed into production and became known as the TM after the French service that developed it. Work by Ferrié and Abraham was nominated for the 1916 Nobel Prize in Physics. However, the patent was granted solely to Peri and Biguet, causing future legal disputes.  Design and specifications  Anode (cylinder), grid (coil) and cathode filament (thin wire inside coil). British Type R tube The electrode assembly of the TM has nearly perfect cylindrical shape. The anode is a nickel cylinder, 10 mm in diameter and 15 mm long. Grid diameter varies from 4.0 to 4.5 mm; the Lyon plant made grids of pure molybdenum, the plant in Ivry-sur- Seine used nickel. The directly-heated cathode filament is a straight wire of pure tungsten, 0.06 mm in diameter. Pure tungsten cathode reached proper emission level when heated to white incandescence, which required heating current of over 0.7 A at 4 V. The filament was so bright that in 1923 Grammont replaced clear glass envelope with dark blue cobalt glass. There were rumours that the company tried to discourage alleged use of radio tubes in place of lightbulbs, or that they tried to protect the eyes of radio operators. Most likely, however, dark glass was used to mask harmless but unsightly metal particles that were inevitably sputtered on the inner surface of the bulb. A typical single-tube radio receiver of World War I used 40 V plate power supply (B battery) and zero bias on the grid (no C battery required). In this mode, the tube operated at 2 mA standing anode current, and had transconductance of 0.4 mA/V, gain (μ) of 10 and anode impedance of 25 kOhm. At higher voltages (i.e. 160 V on the anode and -2 V on the grid), standing plate current rose to 3...6 mA, with reverse grid current up to 1 μA. High grid currents, an inevitable consequence of primitive technology of the 1910s, simplified grid leak biasing. The TM and its immediate clones were general-purpose tubes. In addition to their original radio receiving function, they were successfully employed in radio transmitters. A single Soviet-made P-5 configured as a class C radio frequency generator withstood 500 to 800 Volts plate voltage, and could deliver up to 1 W into the antenna, while a class A circuit could only deliver 40 mW. Audio frequency amplification in class A was feasible using arrays of parallel-connected TMs. Lifetime of a genuine French-made TM, built in strict compliance with the design, did not exceed 100 hours. During the war, factories inevitably had to use substandard raw materials which resulted in substandard tubes. These were usually marked with a cross and suffered from unusually high noise levels and random early failures due to cracks in their glass envelopes.  Production history  Two Type R triodes in a British Aircraft Tuner Receiver Mk. III, 1917 In the course of World War I the TM became the tube of choice of allied armies. Demand exceeded capacity of the Lyon plant, so additional production was delegated to La Compagnie des Lampes plant in Ivry-sur-Seine. Total production volume is unknown, but it was certainly very high for the period. Estimates of daily wartime production vary from one thousand units (Lyon plant alone) to six thousand units. Estimates of total wartime production vary from 1.1 million units (0.8 million in Lyon and 0.3 million in Ivry-sur-Seine) to 1.8 million units for the Lyon plant alone. British authorities quickly realized the benefits of the TM over domestic designs. In 1916 British Thomson-Houston developed necessary technology and tooling, and Osram-Robertson (which would later merge into Marconi-Osram Valve) began large-scale production. The British variants became known collectively as type R. In 1916-1917 the Osram plant produced two visually identical triode types: \\"hard\\" (high vacuum) R1, almost exactly copying the French original, and \\"soft\\" nitrogen-filled R2. The R2 was the last in the line of British gas-filled tubes; all subsequent designs from R3 to R7 were high vacuum tubes. Variants of Type R triodes were made to British order in the United States by Moorhead Laboratories. After the war, Philips launched production of the TM in the Netherlands as Type E. Cylindrical construction patented by Peri and Biguet became a standard feature of British high-power tubes, all the way to the 800-Watt T7X. When the United States entered the war, annual output of the three largest American manufacturers could barely reach 80 thousand tubes of all types. This was too low for a fighting army; soon after deployment in France American Expeditionary Forces outran the quota and had to adopt French radio equipment. Thus, the AEF relied primarily on French-made tubes. In Russia, Mikhail Bonch-Bruevich launched small-scale production of the TM in 1917. In 1923 Soviet authorities purchased French technology and tooling, and launched large-scale production at the Leningrad Electro-Vacuum Plant which would later merge into Svetlana. Soviet clones of the TM were named P-5 and П7, a high-efficiency thoriated-cathode variant was named Микро (Micro). After World War I the general-purpose TM was gradually supplanted with new, specialized receiving and amplifying tubes. In the developed countries of the West the change was largely completed by the end of the 1920s, at which point it had started in less developed countries like the Soviet Union. There is no certain information on the end of production; according to Robert Champeix, production in France probably continued until 1935. In the late 20th century, replicas of the TM were released at least twice, by Rudiger Waltz in Germany (1980s) and by Ricardo Kron in Czech Republic (1992).

October 1952) is a Spanish Professor of Cell Biology in the Andalusian Center for Developmental Biology at the Pablo de Olavide University in Sevilla, Spain. From 2002 to 2012, Professor Navas served as a board member of the International Coenzyme Q10 Association; since 2013, he has been the chairman of the association. Professor Navas' primary research interests include Coenzyme Q biosynthesis and biological functions, Coenzyme Q10 deficiency, plasma membrane structure and function, oxidative stress, lipophilic antioxidants, aging processes, and the mitochondria.  Early education and career  Professor Navas earned his Master of Science degree in biology in 1976 and his Ph.D. in cell biology in 1978, both at the University of Sevilla. During the period 1977 – 1984, Professor Navas worked as Associate Professor at the University of Córdoba and the University of Sevilla.  Fulbright Fellowship  From 1984 to 1986, he was a postdoctoral Fulbright Fellowship scholar at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, where he studied and worked with Professor D. James Morré and Professor Fred L. Crane, the researcher who had discovered Coenzyme Q10 at the Institute of Enzyme Research, University of Wisconsin, in 1957.  Academic positions  In the period from 1987 to 1997, Professor Navas served at the University of Córdoba alternately as Head of the Cell Biology Department and as Vice- Chancellor for Research. From 1997 to 2001, he served as Vice-president for Research at the Pablo de Olavide University in Sevilla. From 1995 to 2000, he also served as Adjunct Professor in the Department of Nutrition Science at Purdue University. As a professor of cell biology at the Pablo de Olavide University in Sevilla, Professor Navas has conducted and published research studies on the biological functions and clinical effects of Coenzyme Q10. He has supervised over 20 Ph.D. dissertations.  Research on Coenzyme Q10  Bioavailability of Coenzyme Q10 Preparations In 2019, Professor Navas, together with his colleague at the Pablo de Olavide University Professor Guillermo López-Lluch and a team of researchers, conducted a double-blind crossover study of seven different supplement formulations containing 100 mg of Coenzyme Q10 in 14 healthy young individuals. They measured bioavailability was measured as area under the curve of plasma CoQ10 levels over 48 hours following ingestion of a single dose. The measurements were repeated in the same group of 14 volunteers with a four-week washout between intakes. The bioavailability study results showed statistically significant differences in the bioavailability of the various formulations. The ubiquinone formulation with the best bioavailability had a Cmax and an area under the curve nearly double that of the ubiquinol formulation. The ubiquinol formulation outperformed other less well-formulated ubiquinone formulations. These study results indicated that the formulation of the Coenzyme Q10 supplement is more important for absorption and bioavailability than the form (ubiquinone vs ubiquinol) of the supplement is. The bioavailability study also showed considerable variation in the participants' capacity to achieve an increase of Coenzyme Q10 in blood from a supplement. Coenzyme Q10 and Aging In 2020, Professor Navas wrote the lead chapter in the book Coenzyme Q in Aging, edited by Professor López-Lluch. Professor Navas emphasized the main functions of Coenzyme Q10 as an electron carrier in respiratory chain and as an antioxidant in the regulation of mitochondrial function and insulin sensitivity in the aging process. He pointed out that the complete Coenzyme Q10 bio-synthesis pathway and the adaptation of Coenzyme Q10 to different pathological conditions to guarantee cell survival need further research. In 2018, Professors Navas and López-Lluch and colleagues published a review of the published results from clinical trials based on Coenzyme Q10 supplementation and aging. They found evidence that the supplementation positively affects mitochondrial deficiency syndrome and the symptoms of aging. The effect is achieved primarily through improvements in cellular bio-energetics. The antioxidant effect of Coenzyme Q10 alleviates systemic inflammation and improves the symptoms and survival of heart failure patients. Numerous published reports suggest that combining Coenzyme Q10 supplementation with statin medication could prevent the side effects resulting from statin treatment. In their review article, Professors Navas and López-Lluch summarized the outcomes of the Q-Symbio Study and the KiSel-10 Study. The Q-Symbio Study was a randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of Coenzyme Q10 adjuvant treatment on morbidity and mortality in chronic heart failure: a 2-year treatment with Coenzyme Q10 in the ubiquinone form (3 times 100 mg/day) demonstrated significant improvement in the survival and symptoms as well as a significant reduction in major cardiovascular events in chronic heart failure patients. The KiSel-10 Study was a randomized controlled trial of the effects of long-term treatment with Coenzyme Q10 as ubiquinone (2 times 100 mg/day) plus selenium (200 microg as selenized yeast) in a healthy elderly population (average age: 78 years). The study results revealed a significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality not only during the 4-year treatment period but also 12 years later, compared to those taking a placebo. Coenzyme Q10 and Physical Activity In 2014, Professor Navas and colleagues published two papers on Coenzyme Q10 and physical activity. In the one paper, they reported that they had measured the levels of Coenzyme Q10 and cholesterol in the plasma of young and old individuals with differing degrees of physical activity. Their results indicated that plasma Coenzyme Q10 levels in old people are higher than the levels found in young people. However, they found differing relationships between Coenzyme Q10 levels and physical activity depending on the age of individuals. In young people, higher physical activity correlated with lower Coenzyme Q10 levels in plasma; in older adults, higher activity was associated with higher plasma Q10 levels and higher Coenzyme Q10/Cholesterol ratios. The higher Coenzyme Q10 levels in plasma were associated with lower levels of lipid-peroxidation and oxidized LDL in the elderly people. The study results indicated that physical activity in the senior years can improve antioxidant capacity in plasma and thus possibly reduce the risk of heart disease. In a second 2014 paper, Professor Navas and colleagues studied a cohort of healthy community-living senior citizens. They tested the volunteers on handgrip strength, six-minute walk, Number of chair stands, and time up and go. They found that individuals with higher levels of functional capacity also had lower levels of cholesterol and lipid peroxidation as well as higher levels of Coenzyme Q10 in plasma. The study results showed that higher levels of functional capacity were associated with higher levels of Coenzyme Q10 and with lower levels of a bio-marker for oxidative stress (malondialdehyde) in the blood of community-living elderly people. The study results suggested that both aerobic and strength exercise are necessary for senior citizens. In a 2018 study, Professor Navas and his fellow researchers investigated the relationship of plasma Coenzyme Q10 levels of elite athletes – professional soccer players in the Spanish Liga 1 – to the levels of known bio-markers for muscle damage (creatine kinase), kidney damage (uric acid), and stress damage (cortisol). Their findings suggested that high levels of plasma Coenzyme Q10 can prevent muscle damage, improve kidney function, and contribute to higher performance in professional soccer players. Coenzyme Q10 Deficiency Coenzyme Q10 deficiency disorders are classified as primary Coenzyme Q10 deficiency – caused by mutations in the genes that code for Coenzyme Q10 bio-synthesis – and secondary Coenzyme Q10 deficiency – caused by mutations in genes not related to Coenzyme Q10 bio-synthesis of by other non-genetic factors. Primary Coenzyme Q10 deficiency disorders are rare. Secondary Coenzyme Q10 deficiencies, both those related to genetic causes and those related to environmental conditions, are the main causes of biochemical Coenzyme Q10 deficiency. It has not been possible to link most of the cases of Coenzyme Q10 deficiency to a specific genetic diagnosis. Moreover, the pathogenesis of Coenzyme Q10 deficiency cannot be attributed solely to defects in the process of cellular bio-energetics. Early recognition of Coenzyme Q10 deficiency is necessary to avoid irreversible tissue damage by instituting timely and appropriate treatment. In addition, many studies have shown reduced levels of Coenzyme Q10 in aging individuals and in individuals with other non- hereditary diseases. Coenzyme Q10 and Autism In a 2014 paper, Professors Crane, Navas, and Gvozdjáková report on the results of a pilot study investigating the effect of Coenzyme Q10 supplement in the ubiquinol form on 24 autistic children aged 3 to 6 years (17 boys, 7 girls). The researchers administered daily doses of 50 mg of a liquid ubiquinol diluted in milk, tea, or juice to the children during the first week of the study. In week 2, they increased the daily dose to 2 times 50 mg in separate doses. They treated the children with 2 times 50 mg ubiquinol for three months. For ethical reasons, the researchers did not have a placebo control group in the study. The mean total Coenzyme Q10 level in blood increased 489% from the baseline level to the 3-month post-supplementation level. The researchers observed a significant improvement in the symptoms of autism after 3 months of ubiquinol supplementation in the children who maintained a total Coenzyme Q10 plasma concentration at or over 2.5 micromol/L (= 2.16 micrograms/mL). The improvement in the symptoms of autism in percentage of children were in the areas of communication (12% of the children), verbal communication (21%), playing games (42%), sleeping (34%), and food acceptance (17%). Supplementation with ubiquinol, the reduced form of Coenzyme Q10, produced favorable responses in children with autism. Professors Crane, Navas, and Gvozdjáková hypothesized that autism is controlled by a Coenzyme Q-dependent redox system in the porin channels; the mechanism still needs to be established. Reduction of Coenzyme Q10 and Antioxidant Activity Coenzyme Q10 molecules are redox molecules. They have the capacity to accept and donate electrons. In the cells, Coenzyme Q10 molecules are found in three different redox states: oxidized (ubiquinone), semi-oxidized (semiubiquinone), and reduced (ubiquinol). Reduced Coenzyme Q10 prevents lipid peroxidation in liposomes and plasma membranes. Coenzyme Q is reduced by the dehydrogenase enzymes NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase and NAD(P)H:quinone reductase 1. Reduced Coenzyme Q10 prevents lipid peroxidation chain reaction. In a 1997 study, Professor Navas and a team of researchers found that cytochrome b5 reductase maintains Coenzyme Q10 and ascorbate in their reduced state to support their antioxidant activity. Thus, Coenzyme Q10 and ascorbate acting as antioxidants at the plasma membrane represent a first-line barrier protecting lipids from oxidative stress and subsequent apoptosis.

It was finally disbanded after an Army reorganisation in 2006. It was considered the best-armed and most powerful division in Spain, made up of an armoured brigade, two mechanised brigades, a cavalry regiment, a field artillery regiment, an anti-aircraft artillery regiment, an engineer group, as well as a logistics group and a grouping of the General Staff, with its units distributed in Castilla y León, Madrid, Castilla-La Mancha, Extremadura, La Rioja and Andalusia. With the military reform of 2006 it was deactivated, and ceased to exist, although its brigades continued in service. In the late 1980s it included the XI Mechanised Infantry Brigade (including the 6th Mechanised Infantry Regiment), the XII Armoured Brigade (built around the 31st Mechanised Infantry Regiment \\"Asturias\\") and supporting formations and units.  Franco Regime The division was established on August 20, 1943 in accordance with General Reserve Instruction No. 2 of the Central General Staff of the Spanish Army, on the basis of the previous 13th Motorized Division (Francoist), part of the I Army Corps of Military Region I. It traces its name to the Battle of Brunete during the Spanish Civil War, which was the largest tank battle in the military history of Spain. Its origins can be found in the military restructuring after the civil war, in which five regiments of battle tanks were established that took advantage of the captured vehicles. In its beginnings it included an infantry regiment, two motorized infantry and one tank regiment. Its most modern vehicles were 20 Panzer IVF, bought from Nazi Germany during the Second World War, and the former Soviet T-26s captured in the civil war from the Republican People's Army. The Panzer IVs received in late 1943 were organized into two companies, distributed among two battalions in the division's armored regiment.Manrique, La Brunete, pp. 26–27 Its first major general in command was Ricardo Rada Peral, and the division was established at the El Goloso Camp, in the Sierra de Madrid. With the normalization of diplomatic and military relations with the United States in the mid-1950s, M24 Chaffee and M47 Patton battle tanks, self-propelled artillery units, and a \\"heavy weapons\\" company joined the division. Between 1953 and 1968, the Spanish Army received a total of 446 medium battle tanks (M47s and M48s), 123 light tanks (M24s and M41s), as well as 30 M74 Armoured Recovery Vehicles. In 1970, the United States agreed to extend the military aid program by another five years, giving Spain another 66 M48A2 tanks and 17 M41A3s.Manrique, La Brunete, p. 69 The vehicles received led to a divisional reorganization in 1965. This included the General Staff, based at El Pardo, and the Nucleo de Tropas Divisionario (Divisionary Troop Nucleus). The latter was formed by the Villaviciosa Light Armored Cavalry Regiment, the Campaign Artillery Regiment, the 1st Anti-Air Artillery Group, Engineering Regiment No. 1 and the Divisional Logistics Group. There were two fighting brigades: Mechanized Infantry Brigade XI, which included the 6th Saboya Motorized Infantry Regiment, the 55th Uad Ras Mechanized Infantry Regiment, the XI Self-Propelled Artillery Group, the XI Engineering Battalion and Logistics Group XI. The other was Armored Brigade XII, which was made up of the 61st Alcázar de Toledo Armored Infantry Regiment, the 31st Asturias Mechanized Infantry Regiment, the XII Self- Propelled Artillery Group, the XII Engineering Battalion and Logistics Group XII.Manrique, La Brunete, pp. 39–42 The majority of the division's armor was located in the Alcázar de Toledo Armored Infantry Regiment, which contained two regiments of 48 M48s and 54 M47s, respectively.Manrique, La Brunete, p. 43  1981 attempted coup  The Brunete Division occupied a important role in the conspirators' plans for the 1981 Spanish coup d'état attempt (the so- called \\"23-F\\"), which occurred on 23 February 1981. At that time, it was made up of 13,000 troops with abundant vehicles and war material, and its commanding general was Major General José Juste Fernández. Prior to this, there was the General of Division Luis Torres Rojas (at that time, military governor of La Coruña, in the VIII Military Region) and previously before then Captain General of the III Military Region, Jaime Milans del Bosch. Both were military officers heavily involved in the conspiracy and with a long conspiratorial past. Important officers of the division, such as José Ignacio San Martín (chief of the division's General Staff) and Ricardo Pardo Zancada were fully in favor of the coup d'état and were active conspirators. The protagonists of 23-F, El Mundo, February 22, 2001, accessed February 20, 2011. and José Ignacio San Martín, colonel sentenced by 23-F, El País , June 8, 2004, consult on February 24, 2011. During an official reception on November 18, 1980, Colonel José Ignacio San Martín had commented to the king Juan Carlos I that \\"in the division they were\\" pissed off, very pissed off \\"with the situation in the country.\\" By the afternoon of February 23, the Brunete commanders had received orders to place troops in Madrid \\"at the service of Spain and in the name of the King.\\" They had been assigned the following positions: the Carrera de San Jerónimo, the Retiro Park, the Isabel II canal, the Campo del Moro (adjacent to the Palacio de Oriente) and the main media, especially Radio Televisión Española. Torres Rojas rushed back from La Coruña to try to take command of the division and get it involved in the coup, but did not succeed. And the Brunete troops did not reach those places thanks to the orders of the Captain General of Madrid, Lieutenant General Quintana Lacaci, who contained the commanders of the units that were already leaving. Much later, the divisional commander, Major General Juste, realizing that the King had not ordered any movement of troops (contrary to what the conspirators had announced), also ordered any action to be stopped. However, the hesitant attitude of General Juste in the first few moments earned him dismissal a few months later.  Post Cold War  The division was reorganised and reduced after the end of the Cold War, under the NORTE plan. It was finally dissolved in 2006.

Doshi wrote the novel over the course of seven years. It tells the story of a troubled mother-daughter relationship in Pune, India. The novel was first published in India in August 2019. It was published in the United Kingdom under the title Burnt Sugar in July 2020. The novel has been shortlisted for the 2020 Booker Prize. Background The novel was written by Doshi over the course of seven years. In 2012, while working as a curator in Mumbai, Doshi wrote her first draft of the novel in order to meet the deadline for the Tibor Jones South Asia prize for an unpublished manuscript. She won the prize in a unanimous decision by its five judges. She began writing the novel in Pune. Doshi credits a moment while in her grandmother's flat in Pune when a distortion in a mirror warped her reflection, and she saw two different people in her face. The same day, she wrote what would later become the first fragment of the novel. She continued her writing of the novel in Mumbai, the United States and the United Arab Emirates, where she started and completed the final draft. Doshi struggled to complete the novel, writing eight different drafts over seven years. The drafts varied drastically and were written with different points of view and voices. Doshi described the process as a \\"dark and difficult journey\\" of fighting self-doubt. The novel was partially inspired by her mother's familial connection to the Osho ashram in Pune, created in 1976 by the guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. However, Doshi has stressed that the novel is not autobiographical and that relationship at its centre is not based on her relationship with her own mother. Doshi was also partly inspired by Sheila Heti's autobiographical novel Motherhood (2018). Synopsis In Pune, Antara must care for her ageing mother Tara who is experiencing memory loss from what is suspected to be the early onset of Alzheimer's disease. Tara lived a rebellious and careless life, abandoning her marriage to join an ashram and pursure a romance with a guru. Antara was neglected and abused by her mother as a child. Antara reckons with the contempt she holds for her mother as she is forced to care for her. \\"I would be lying if I said my mother's misery has never given me pleasure\\" is the opening sentence of the novel. Themes Doshi described \\"obsession, memory and the boundaries of the self\\" as being the novel's main themes. Particularly, how memory is \\"co-authored\\" by the people who collectively remember specific stories and continute restate and rearrange them, altering each other's memories in the process. The theme of the fallibility of memory was partly inspired by Doshi's own grandmother who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease while she was writing the novel. Her mother felt she was \\"going mad\\" while being with her grandmother. The concept of how caretakers often \\"question their own hold on reality\\" influenced Doshi's writing. Doshi admits a parallel between Antara's preoccupation with Alzheimer's and her own, saying, \\"She makes sense of the disease through drawing it, and I made sense of it through writing this novel.\\" Publication The novel was first published under the title Girl in White Cotton in India in 2019. It was published by in hardcover format Fourth Estate, an imprint of HarperCollins India, on 25 August 2019. Doshi received offers from three publishers immediately after her literary agent presented the novel for sale. Shortly after its publication, the novel was recommended by Vogue India and was praised by several writers, including Fatima Bhutto, Elizabeth Gilbert, Olivia Sudjic, Tishani Doshi, Janice Pariat, Diksha Basu and Sharlene Teo. On 13 September 2019, British publisher Hamish Hamilton announced it had bought the world English volume, audio and serial rights to the novel and would publish it in summer 2020. On 30 July 2020, the novel was published under the title Burnt Sugar in paperback format in the United Kingdom by Hamish Hamilton. An audiobook narrated by Vineeta Rishi was released by Penguin the same day. Doshi was also interviewed the same day on BBC Radio 4's Front Row programme to coincide the novel's UK publication. The novel is scheduled to be published in the United States by The Overlook Press in spring 2021. Reception The novel's opening sentence was singled out and praised by many critics for its strength and for being memorable. Saudamini Jain of Hindustan Times praised Doshi's characterization in the novel, writing, \\"Their feelings and resentments — even in alien situations — are uncannily identifiable.\\" Esha Datanwala of Scroll.in gave the novel a rave review, praising its narrative structure and Doshi for knowing \\"exactly how to make her characters human, how to describe Pune and Bombay to elicit nostalgia, how to cut through the frivolity of modern writers and say exactly what is appropriate.\\" Rohan Manoj of The Hindu agreed, praising Doshi's \\"crisp prose\\" and her \\"powers of observation\\" regarding human relationships and the \\"physical reality\\" of both Pune and Mumbai. Paromita Chakrabarti of The Indian Express called it a \\"hard, unflinching look at familial bonds and how they damn us and unravel us.\\" Urvashi Bahuguna of India Today praised the novel for revealing \\"the limited power afforded to women and the price they pay for acting in their own interest.\\" Francesca Carington of The Daily Telegraph gave the novel a perfect 5 out of 5 stars rating, praising Doshi's \\"feverish prose\\" and calling it a \\"corrosive, compulsive debut.\\" In his review for The Times, John Self called it \\"a good debut, but by declaring it one of the year's very best novels, the Booker judges might have given it as much a burden as an accolade.\\" Alex Peake-Tomkinson of The Times Literary Supplement praised the rapid changes in tone of Doshi's prose for enlivening the novel but largely criticized it for capitulating to an \\"urge to shock\\", calling the noovel \\"needlessly depressing\\" at times. Elle Hunt of The Guardian called it \\"an unsettling, sinewy debut, startling in its venom and disarming in its humour from the very first sentence\\". =Accolades= The novel has been shortlisted for the 2020 Booker Prize. Judges of the prize called the novel an \\"utterly compelling read\\" that \\"examines a complex and unusual mother-daughter relationship with honest, unflinching realism – sometimes emotionally wrenching but also cathartic, written with poignancy and memorability.\\" It was longlisted for the 2019 Tata Literature Live!

Part of Sony's flagship Xperia series, the phone was announced on September 17, 2020. The device is a cheaper, more compact variant of the Xperia 1 II. The Xperia 5 II will ship with support for 5G NR in Europe and Asia (making it Sony's second Xperia device to support this network), while the United States will ship with a 4G variant. Although 5G networks are supported, it only supports \\"sub-6\\" 5G, meaning it is not compatible with millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks. Design The Xperia 5 II retains Sony's signature square design that is seen on previous Xperia phones. It is built similarly to the Xperia 1 II, using anodized aluminum for the frame and Corning Gorilla Glass 6 for the screen and back panel, as well as IP65 and IP68 certifications for water resistance. The build has a pair of symmetrical bezels on the top and the bottom, where the front-facing dual stereo speakers and the front camera are placed. The left side of the phone contains a slot for a SIM card and a microSDXC card, while the right side contains a fingerprint reader embedded into the power button, a volume rocker and a shutter button. A dedicated Google Assistant button is located between the power and shutter buttons. The earpiece, front-facing camera, notification LED and various sensors are housed in the top bezel. The bottom edge has the primary microphone and USB-C port; the rear cameras are arranged in a vertical strip. The phone will ship in four colors: Black, Gray, Blue and Pink. Specifications =Hardware= The Xperia 5 II is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 SoC and an Adreno 650 GPU, accompanied by 8 GB of LPDDR4X RAM. It has 128 or 256 GB of UFS internal storage, and microSD expansion is supported up to 1 TB with a hybrid dual-SIM setup. The display is smaller and has a lower resolution than the Xperia 1 II, using a 6.1 in 21:9 1080p (1080 × 2520) HDR OLED panel which results in a pixel density of 449 ppi. While the size and resolution are unchanged, it features a 120 Hz refresh rate. The camera system is similar to the Xperia 1 II in terms of hardware (a 12 MP primary lens, a 12 MP telephoto lens and a 12 MP ultrawide lens with an 8 MP front camera), but does not have a 3D iToF sensor. The telephoto lens has been upgraded from 2x to 3x optical zoom, and the ultrawide lens gains autofocus. Additionally, the lenses add ZEISS' T✻ (T-Star) anti-reflective coating. Software improvements include JPG+RAW shooting and HDR for 4K/120fps slow motion videos. The battery capacity has been increased to 4000mAh, the same as the 1 II despite the smaller body. USB Power Delivery 3.0 is supported at 21W over USB-C, although it lacks wireless charging capabilities. The device includes a 3.5mm audio jack, which was removed on its predecessor, as well as an active external amplifier. =Software= The Xperia 5 II runs on Android 10. Sony has also paired the phone's camera tech with a \\"Pro\\" mode developed by Sony's camera division CineAlta, whose features take after Sony's Alpha camera lineup.

Early life Alexander Campbell was born on 15 March 1805 at Sunipol on the Isle of Mull in Scotland. He was the son of a farmer who was involved in the raising and shipping of livestock from Mull to the markets on the mainland. Van Diemen's Land Two of Campbell's brothers, Colin and Neil, emigrated to Van Diemen's Land in the early 1820s, to take up land. Alexander decided to join them, and early in 1825 he sailed in the barque Triton arriving in Hobart in October of that year. Campbell met his brother Colin, who had taken up a farm at White Hills, near Launceston. Alexander managed the farm, growing wheat and raising cattle and sheep. He was later employed by Simeon Lord to manage the Bona Vista Station, on the South Esk River. In 1829, Campbell returned to his brother's farm at White Hills. During this period, he took an active role in the Black War between British settlers and the Aboriginal Tasmanians. In 1830 he was placed in charge of 15 armed convicts as part of the massive Black Line campaign which scoured the settled areas for native people aiming to trap them at the Tasman Peninsula. At this time Campbell met with John Batman and Governor George Arthur. For his services, he obtained a land grant of 320 acres, which he subsequently sold for £120. Whaling In 1831, Campbell went to Sydney where he was informed about the profitable sperm whaling industry. He joined the Sir William Wallace, a vessel of 272 tons, which set out on an extensive whaling voyage lasting two years, visiting the waters around the New Hebrides and the coast of Japan. In 1835 Campbell joined the crew of the whaling schooner Mars which hunted the mammals around New Zealand. Portland Bay In 1836 Campbell was employed to take charge of the whaling station at Portland Bay. Campbell joined other whaling captains such as John and Charles Mills, William Dutton, and Captain John Griffiths in utilising Portland Bay as a base for whaling operations in this area. Port Fairy In 1837, Campbell decided to construct a whaling station at Port Fairy to the east of Portland Bay. Houses were soon built on Griffiths Island just off the coast of the port. This whaling establishment proved successful with Captain Campbell securing 220 tons of oil and 13 tons of whalebone in the first season. Campbell, in conjunction with John Griffiths and Michael Connolly, set up a farming and whaling company and sheep were transported into Port Fairy. A sheep station known as \\"The Farm\\" was formed, which afterwards became the Farnham Estate. Aboriginal people in the area being dispossessed of their land took to taking large amounts of these sheep and the colonists formed a punitive expedition under Mr McDonald, and punished them severely. Campbell had an Aboriginal servant whom he named \\"Sou-wester\\". In 1839, when the vessel Children was wrecked thirty miles east of Port Fairy, Campbell was largely responsible for saving eighteen lives. Conflict with the local Aboriginal people flared again in 1842, and Campbell was one of a number of colonists in the region who petitioned the government for armed protection. In 1842 the whaling and farming company Campbell had formed with Griffiths and Connolly failed. He lost the whole of his savings. Ten thousand sheep and 2,500 head of cattle were sold off. All that was left to Captain Campbell was a land claim extending to the Hopkins River, which included the site of the future town of Warrnambool. He later sold this land for £80. He captained various vessels trading between the ports of Sydney, Launceston, Port Fairy, and Melbourne. His business partner John Griffiths soon afterwards re-established the whaling station at Port Fairy again, and Captain Campbell joined in the enterprise. In 1844, while living there, he married his wife, Mary Ann Coulson (16 June 1817 - 17 Sept 1902). During the next three years Captain Campbell continued whaling and trading out of Port Fairy. By the year 1847, however, whaling had ceased to be profitable and Campbell moved into the business of salvaging and on-selling ships. He also built a flour mill at Rosebrook not far from Port Fairy. Rolf Boldrewood wrote about Alexander Campbell in his biographical novel Old Melbourne Memories describing him as \\"a stalwart Highlander, long known as Port Fairy Campbell.\\" Melbourne harbourmaster and later life In 1851 Campbell obtained the appointment of assistant harbourmaster of the Port of Melbourne, and became the chief harbourmaster of that port by 1863. He continued in this position until 1869, when he retired at the age of 64. In retirement, he established a farm at Fulham in Gippsland but later returned to live in Melbourne at Caroline Street in South Yarra, where he died in 1890. He was buried in Brighton cemetery. Legacy Port Campbell, a harbour Campbell took refuge in during a storm in 1843, was named after him.

This statistic varies from state to state, in Kansas, Blacks are seven times more likely to have died than white residents, while in Washington, D.C., the rate among Blacks is six times as high as it is for whites. In Missouri and Wisconsin, it is five times greater. Blacks are 13% of the U.S. population that has released COVID-19 mortality data, but they account for 25% of the deaths. South Carolina and Michigan had the largest gaps — 25 points — between the percentage of Blacks in the population and the percentage of COVID-19 victims who were Black, Virginia and North Carolina had the smallest gaps: three points. The impacts of this disease can be seen in this communities diminished health care, and finances. Healthcare Disparities Around the country Blacks make up a higher proportion of some low-paid professions that have elevated risks of exposure to the virus — grocery store workers, transit workers and those who work at food plants, for example. Black Americans are more likely to have diseases such as hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes — conditions that amplify the severity of COVID-19. Research has shown that not only do Blacks develop these diseases at a greater rate than whites, they also tend to develop them at a younger age. Medical experts attribute the disproportionate rates of these diseases in Blacks to higher levels of stress and racial discrimination. Blacks are also overrepresented among the uninsured, consequently they tend to delay seeking treatment and when they do present for care are sicker than white patients. High rates of Black households report since the COVID-19 Pandemic, they have been unable to get health care or delayed getting health care. Many say they couldn't find a doctor to see them since the shutdowns, hospitals have delayed or canceled surgical procedures to focus on treating the COVID-19. Blacks have reported suffering from a negative health consequence as a result of these delays. When they do seek medical treatment, the moment Blacks enter the healthcare system, from the most basic forms of diagnostic and treatment interventions, they receive fewer procedures and poorer quality medical care than whites. In addition to those challenges many Blacks live with people who are at high risk for developing serious illness from the COVID-19 because of their age or underlying medical conditions. Finances The COVID-19 Pandemic could not have come at a worst time for many families. Pre-pandemic, Blacks had the highest unemployment rates in the country, their households earned 59 cents for every dollar white houses earned and every dollar of reserve that white households have, Black households only have 10 pennies. Significant numbers of households in the Black community have reported in addition to job loss that can be as high as twice that as whites and reduced hours that their savings were depleted by the pandemic (if they had any savings to start with) or that they had fallen behind on housing payments or have had problems paying debts and/or utility bills. Federal support for families from the CARES Act has expired and Congress continues to debate the funding many families desperately need. Blacks and Latinos were hit especially hard when stay at home orders were put in place as well as social distancing mandates because they are over represented in the leisure and hospitality industries with jobs at hotels, restaurants, retail and construction.

Smoking Azalea smokes about one pack of cigarettes a day, though she reportedly does not inhale when smoking. She is able to light her own cigarettes using a lighter and has also learned to light a cigarette by touching it to the end of a lit cigarette. Azalea's trainers support her smoking, providing her with both supplies and encouragement. Azalea is popular with the zoo's visitors, many of whom find her funny. Smoking is a widespread habit among men in North Korea, with approximately 45% of men smoking on a regular basis and 30% of men dying from tobacco-related illnesses. Azalea is also able to perform tricks like dancing, bowing, and touching her nose.  Criticism  The Zoo has been criticized by PETA President Ingrid Newkirk, who stated that it was \\"cruel to willfully addict a chimpanzee to tobacco for human amusement\\" and that smoking was as dangerous to Azalea as it is to humans.

It continues to serve as UTA Fort Worth, which has awarded over 3,500 total degrees and has expanded to include ten different degree programs since its establishment in 2007.  Architecture  Santa Fe Freight Building, circa 1950 Erected in 1938 to replace an existing freight depot, the Santa Fe Freight Building was constructed during the stylistic phase of Art Deco known as PWA Moderne (PWA standing for the Public Works Administration), which combined elements of former architectural styles and was popular for both government and commercial projects. Due to a sudden boost of prosperity in 1920s, the city of Fort Worth emerged as a major center of Art Deco architecture, constructing dozens of new buildings in the 1920s and 1930s, many of which remain prominent features of the city's landscape. At the time of its construction, the Santa Fe Freight Building was noted for featuring extensive cold storage for perishable freight. The use of reinforced concrete, a key feature of Art Deco construction that allowed for larger buildings, was also noteworthy to contemporary commenters. Exterior features of the building are largely utilitarian (a hallmark of PWA buildings) but it does boast decorative elements such as a parapet and a neon sign. The Santa Fe Freight Building is two stories in height and measures in length by in width. As originally designed, the first floor consisted of a freight warehouse that also included a cold-storage capabilities. The second floor housed office space for both the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway's freight agent and its division superintendent.  History  = Freight depot = The Santa Fe Freight Building was built on the site of a former freight depot that stood between 12th and 14 Streets and east of Jones Street, which was torn down in 1937. That year, building of the new freight depot was bid out for $123,900, and construction was expected to take 10 months with 50-100 workers for most phases of the project. Construction was delayed a few days in July 1937 due to the Little Steel strike, and it was ultimately completed in May 1938. Together with the newly renovated Fort Worth Union Depot, the new freight depot was jointly owned by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and the Southern Pacific Company. At the inauguration of its operation, there were 16 trains serving Fort Worth each day: eight run by the Santa Fe, four by the Southern Pacific, and four by the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. In 1995, Fort Worth's Historic and Cultural Landmarks Commission recommended that the Santa Fe Freight Depot be designated one of 15 historic \\"highly significant endangered properties\\" in the city. By 1998, both the Santa Fe Freight Building and nearby Fort Worth Union Depot had become vacant. They were both bought by Fort Worth-based investor Shirlee Gandy that year, who proceeded to develop the Union Depot into an events venue to pair with the Ashton Hotel, which she also owned. After a long period of vacancy, the freight depot was restored by local developers in 2002. = Fort Worth Rail Market = A second phase for the Santa Fe Freight Building began in May 2002, as the city planned to convert it into an open market space christened the Fort Worth Rail Market that combined \\"specialty boutiques with fresh-produce stands and small restaurants\\". The Rail Market's first tenant was Hot Damn, Tamales; it also hosted Coffee Haus, Lone Star Wines, and Seafoodville, and was the first home of vegan restaurant Spiral Diner. However, Fort Worth city leaders grew increasingly concerned with the market's very low profit margins after just two years, observing that it was \\"hundreds of thousands of dollars in the red\\". Opinions as to why the market struggled so much financially were divided. Certain merchants laid the blame on the city administration and cited mismanagement as the primary cause. The manager of the project countered that he had the responsibility to safeguard public funds. The falling margins, combined with unexpectedly low public interest, eventually resulted in the Tax Increment Financing (TIF) commission approving a plan that would result in the conversion of \\"most of the space to offices or a large restaurant\\", which would reduce the annual losses by over 50%. This approach ultimately was not sustainable and the Fort Worth Rail Market would be abandoned completely by 2005. = UTA Fort Worth campus = Santa Fe Freight Building in 2016, with UTA signage In February 2006, after receiving approval from the University of Texas System Board of Regents, the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) signed a 10-year lease to use the Santa Fe Freight Building as its Fort Worth satellite campus. After UTA spent approximately $1.2 million to redesign and renovate the building, it opened for classes as the Fort Worth Center on January 17, 2007. At its opening, the building measured roughly that included eight classrooms and a library with over 40 computers. Before acquiring the Santa Fe Freight Building, UTA had previously offered a Master of Business Administration (MBA) in Fort Worth since 2000, with classes first held at the UTA Research Institute in eastern Fort Worth. Since opening in 2007, UTA Fort Worth has awarded over 3,500 total degrees and has expanded to include ten different degree programs. Eight of these programs are at the graduate level and encompass business administration, criminology/criminal justice, health care administration, real estate, and social work. The other two programs offered are at the undergraduate level: a Bachelor of Social Work program and a Registered Nurse (RN) to Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) program. UTA Fort Worth also offers professional development through its corporate education initiative.

The conversation, August 29, 2018 Helicopter research in soil science Soil scientists have qualified helicopter research as a perpetuation of colonial science. Typically researchers from rich countries would come to establish soil profile pits, which is often more easily done in poor countries given the availability of cheap labour and goodwill of villagers to dig a pit on their land against small payment. The profile will be described and samples taken with the help of local people, possibly also university staff. In case of helicopter research, the outcomes are then published, sometimes in high-level journals without the involvement of local colleagues.  Within-country helicopter research  When scientists from a central, dominant ethnic or sociological group conduct research in areas where minority groups are living (often peripheral areas), there is also a risk for helicopter research, though it may not appear directly from the academic affiliation of the researchers. For instance, within the USA, it has been used primarily in the study of Native Americans.  Negative effects for science  The use of helicopter research has also led to a stigma of research within minority groups; some going so far as to deny research within their communities. Such safari studies lead to long-term negative effects for the scientific community and researchers, as distrust develops within peripheral communities.  Subsidiary issues  = \\"Donor robbery\\"= Funds for research in developing countries are often provided by bilateral and international academic and research programmes for sustainable development.

As a British overseas military base, it is used to facilitate the deployment of the British Armed Forces in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. History In March 2016, the British government secured a joint venture between the British-based Babcock International and the Omani-based Oman Drydock Company to develop the Al Duqm Port & Drydock into a strategic port capable of supporting naval operations. An agreement was subsequently announced to construct logistical support infrastructure especially for the British Armed Forces, named the UK Joint Logistics Support Base (UKJLSB), in August 2017. The location was chosen by the UK due to its strategic position, which is east of the Suez Canal but outside the Persian Gulf. It is part of the UK's wider foreign policy strategy to re-engage globally after Brexit, in particular within the Middle East and Asia-Pacific. Other British military bases within the region include HMS Jufair and RAF Al Udeid, which are located in Bahrain and Qatar, respectively. Following construction by Babcock International, the UKJLSB was officially opened in October 2018 and was used during Exercise Saif Sareea 3, the largest British military exercise in the region for over 15 years. The base is large enough to accommodate the Royal Navy's nuclear submarines and Queen Elizabeth- class aircraft carriers, which will utilize the facilities operationally from 2021. Dry dock facilities large enough to accommodate the aircraft carriers are also available for use. As a joint base, it is controlled by Strategic Command (previously Joint Forces Command) and is currently leased for 37 years. During a trip to the Middle East in September 2020, British Secretary of State for Defence Ben Wallace announced that the UKJLSB would be tripled in size following a £23.8 million investment to better facilitate British Army training. Another facility, a joint training area, was also established in the nearby Ras Madrakah training area, named the Omani-British Joint Training Area, in 2019.

She and three others took the Law Society to court for defining \\"person\\" as \\"man\\". Life Nettlefold was born in London in 1891. Her parents were Emily Josephine (born Buckingham) and Oswald Nettlefold. Her father was a wholesaler of hardware. She was never awarded a law degree because she was a woman. She attended Newnham College and she was the first woman to be awarded for coming first in both parts of Cambridge University's double law tripos. Cambridge allowed women to take the exams but never awarded them degrees for many decades. She was articled unofficially to a Lincoln's Inn law firm before joining the National Service for Women. Bebb v. The Law Society In 1913 Nettlefold and three other women started an unsuccessful legal action requesting that the Law Society should be compelled to admit women to its preliminary examinations. The three other women were Maud Crofts, Karin Costelloe, who became a psychoanalyst, and Gwyneth Bebb. Her friend Bebb became the named party for, Bebb v. The Law Society represented by Stanley Buckmaster KC and R. A. Wright. The test case was heard in the Chancery Division in July 1913 by a hostile judge Mr Justice Joyce. The Solicitors Act 1843 included the sentence, 'every Word importing the Masculine Gender only shall extend and be applied to a Female as well as a Male'. The judge ruled that women had no precedent and therefore he could not authorise the first. The decision was upheld in the Court of Appeal in December 1913, heard by the Master of the Rolls Lord Cozens-Hardy, Lord Justice Swinfen Eady and Lord Justice Phillimore (included in the law reports in 1914).[1914] 1 Ch. 286 The press was mostly in favour and case helped the campaign for women's admission to the legal profession in Britain, and the passage of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 allowed women to be lawyers. Bebb was expected to be the first Brititish woman lawyer but she died giving birth to her second child. Nettlefold abandoned a career in law after World War I and became a director of Nettlefold & Sons; in 1924, she and her brother became joint managing directors and served until 1945. Of the four who had contested the legal case only Maud Crofts succeeded in becoming a lawyer. Nettlefold left law, Costelloe became a psychoanalyst, Bedd died, but Crofts became the first woman lawyer and a partner in the law firm of Crofts, Ingram and Wyatt & Co. Public life In 1939 when war broke out two women were appointed to lead the reformed Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS). There was no staff and initially only volunteer helpers but 1,500 new members were to be recruited. The interview panel was the WRNS director Vera Laughton Mathews, her deputy Ethel Goodenough, Myra Curtis and Nettlefold who was chosen because she had been at university with Mathews. In 1944, Nettlefold joined the Royal Commission on equal pay. She and two others had to present a minority report as the commission would not support their position of equal pay for women as a recommendation. She joined London County Council in 1949 for the Conservative Party and she became an OBE in 1946. She was on the LCC until 1960. In 1953 she joined Marylebone borough council. Her sister Joyce Newton Thompson became first woman mayor of Cape Town. Nettlefold retired in 1960 and died in Cape Town in 1966.

Some Thoughts on Telepathy and Subconsciousness in Animals, published in 1916.Blackman, Lisa. (2012). Immaterial Bodies: Affect, Embodiment, Mediation. SAGE Publications. pp. xvii- xviii. Newland used the analogy of the Marconi wireless system to understand instinctual behavior amongst animals. Newland equated the immaterial or unseen to an instinctive subconscious mind within a group of animals which provided the behavior of nesting, migration, homing instincts, stampedes and swarming. Newland cited examples of instinctual behavior from insects, moths, flies, birds and fish which he believed was evidence for a telepathic process such as telaesthesia. He defined telaesthesia as \\"perception at a distance or power of vision transcending time and space\\". Newland held the view that all animals are incarnate fragments of an \\"all mind\\" and that members of a flock are thus directed by common intelligence. A review in the Nature journal commented that Newland has many interesting observations but \\"he has ventured on a line of interpretation where verification is impossible\\" and his ideas were \\"too metaphysical\\". Another review suggested that \\"Mr Newland can scarely expect biologists to adopt his theory... though we cannot take the philosophy of this book seriously, yet it constitutes pleasant reading, on account of its original observations and genuine feelings for nature.\\" Newland died in 1921.

Her novel, The Enlightenment of the Greengage Tree, has been nominated for the Stella Prize and the International Booker Prize.  Life  Azar was born in Iran in 1972. Her father was an author and a poet, and she studied literature in university before becoming a writer and journalist. She began her career as an editor and wrote as well for a literary encyclopedia in Iran. She later worked as an editor in a newspaper, before taking up writing as a journalist. As a journalist, she covered issues relation to human rights, and particularly, women's rights. She was arrested thrice in connection with her work, which was often critical of the Iranian government, and had been placed in solitary confinement for a period of three months during one such arrest. On advice from her family, she fled Iran to Turkey, and from there to Indonesia, from where she traveled by boat, arriving at an Australian refugee detention center on Christmas Island in 2011. She sought and was granted political asylum in Australia in 2011. She did not speak English on her arrival to Australia, and learned the language as an adult. She currently lives in Geelong, Victoria, and is studying communication and journalism at Deakin University.  Writing  Azar's 2020 novel, The Enlightenment of the Greengage Tree is set in Iran, deploying magic realism to narrate the incidents surrounding the life of a family in Iran during the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The novel was originally written in Farsi, and was first published in English translation by the Wild Dingo Press in Australia in 2017. The translator has chosen to remain anonymous. It was nominated for the Stella Prize for Fiction in Australia in 2018.

The New York-based show featured popular guest stars and had an elaborate Hollywood and Vine set, and a large cast of singers and female dancers.

Born in Leipzig, Geyer was the son of Friedrich Geyer, a prominent social democrat. Geyer followed his father in joining the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), and studied history at university, receiving a doctorate in 1914. He became a newspaper editor on various local SPD publications, but he opposed World War I and so joined the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD), losing his job. He found work with the Leipziger Volkszeitung, and was the USPD's leading figure in the city during the German Revolution of 1918-1919. He was active in the Workers' and Soldiers' Congress, and won election to the Weimar National Assembly, and then the Reichstag. Although Geyer lost influence in Leipzig to the right-wing of the USPD, he remained a national figure, and an early advocate of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). He became editor of the Hamburger Volkszeitung, and then co-editor of the Kommunistische Rundschau. He was also elected to the central committee of the KPD. In 1921, Geyer resigned from the KPD, in sympathy with Paul Levi, joining the Communist Working Group, then the USPD and the SPD. He lost his seat in the Reichstag in 1924, and became an editor on Vorwärts. When the Nazis came to power, in 1933, he fled to Prague, and then onto Paris, where he became editor of the Neuen Vorwärts. He helped German emigrants escape the advancing Nazis before, in 1941, emigrating to the United Kingdom. There, he became sympathetic to the anti- German ideas of Robert Vansittart, joining the Fight for Freedom group, and being excluded from the Union of German Socialist Organisations in Great Britain. Geyer remained in London after World War II, and wrote for various West German newspapers.

Most of his more prominent buildings are in southern Germany or Berlin. Although he is known for a number of large high- profile residential developments, he has also attracted widespread critical and public attention with public buildings and structures such as the Seeparkturm (tower in a park) in Freiburg, the Kupferstichkabinett ('museum of graphic art) in Berlin, various underground stations such as those of Am Hart (Munich) and Mendelssohn-Bartholdy-Park (Berlin) and several art galleries including the controversial Gemäldegalerie in Berlin. He studied for several years during the 1960s in North America as a post-graduate student. During that period he was employed with the firm of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Christoph Sattler is the son of one German architect and the grandson of another. Life Christoph Sattler was born in Munich which was administered as part of the US occupation zone after 1945. In cultural, social and political terms Bavaria (of which Munich is the capital) was heavily influenced by the United States during the so-called Wirtschaftswunder years through which he grew up. He was born into a prosperous family that had come through the twelve Nazi years unburdened by Nazi political connections, in the judgment of the military occupiers. Christoph Sattler was a Godchild of the high-profile priest-intellectual, Romano Guardini, and was indeed christened with \\"Romano\\" as his middle name, in celebration of that connection.Romano Guardini in Grendach, Verwaltungsgemeinschaft Waging am See In 1952 he was entrolled at the German school in Rome. (His father, having switched careers, had recently accepted a senior diplomatic posting to the newly re-established West German embassy in the city.) In 1957 he enrolled at the Technical University of Munich: here he studied Architecture with a number of eminent teachers, including Johannes Ludwig, Josef Wiedemann and Franz Hart. He obtained practical experience with the architects Rudolf Schwarz (1960) and Peter C. von Seidlein. Sattler moved to Chicago in 1963 where he studied at the Illinois Institute of Technology. Between 1963 and 1965 he was taught by Myron Goldsmith and Ludwig Hilberseimer, also working during 1964 for Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Afrter receiving his Master of Science (M. Sc.) degree in 1965 he returned to West Germany where between 1966 and 1973 he worked in the planning department of Neue Heimat (NH), a Hamburg-based non-profit housing and construction enterprise belonging to the German Trade Union Confederation.

The system was also the easternmost-forming Atlantic tropical cyclone on record in the basin, exceeding the previous record of Tropical Storm Christine in 1973. The twenty-fourth cyclone and twenty-second named storm of the extremely active and record-breaking 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Alpha originated from a large non-tropical low that was first monitored by the National Hurricane Center on 15 September. Initially not anticipated to transition into a tropical cyclone, the low gradually tracked south-southeastward for several days with little development. By 18 September, the low began to separate from its frontal features and exhibited sufficient organization to be classified as a subtropical cyclone as it approached the Iberian Peninsula, becoming a subtropical storm later that day. Alpha made landfall just north of Lisbon, Portugal during the evening of 18 September, becoming the first recorded landfalling (sub)tropical cyclone in mainland Portugal. Alpha was also the third confirmed (sub)tropical cyclone landfall in mainland Europe, following a hurricane in Spain in 1842 and Hurricane Vince (as a tropical depression) in 2005. Alpha rapidly weakened and became a remnant low early on 19 September. At least two tornadoes were confirmed in Portugal and one person was killed from high winds. Total damages from the storm were estimated to be in the millions of euros. Meteorological history On 15 September, the National Hurricane Center began to monitor a non-tropical low-pressure system well north of the Azores for possible development into a tropical or subtropical cyclone, as it was expected to track close to a warm pool of water to the west of Portugal. Development was initially very slow for the system, and the NHC did not consider it likely to develop at the time. The low tracked generally south-southeastward for the next day, and as it approached closer to the Iberian Peninsula chances appeared to be decreasing for any subtropical development of the cyclone. Nonetheless, thunderstorm activity became more concentrated and organized near the center of the low as it gradually shed its frontal features, although the central low struggled to become the dominant feature. This central low feature soon enough became encased within the larger non-tropical low, and thunderstorm activity persisted. A combination of radar imagery from Portugal, scatterometer passes, and satellite derived wind data soon revealed Subtropical Storm Alpha had formed at 16:30 UTC, on 18 September, just a couple hundred miles from the coast of Portugal, and was already producing sustained winds up to 50 mph (80 km/h). Two hours later, at 18:30 UTC, Alpha made landfall in central Portugal at peak intensity, with an atmospheric pressure of 996 mbars (29.44 inHg), based on a surface pressure of 999 mbar (20.50 inHg) being recorded in Monte Real, Portugal, well north of the cyclone. This was the first time on record that a subtropical or tropical storm had made landfall in mainland Portugal. Alpha then quickly weakened as it headed further into the Iberian Peninsula, and became a remnant low at 03:00 UTC on 19 September. Preparations and impact Subtropical Storm Alpha (left) and Medicane Ianos (right) in the Mediterranean on 18 September. In preparation for Alpha on 18 September, orange warnings were raised for high wind and heavy rain in the Coimbra and Leiria districts of Portugal. Winds due to Alpha and its associated non-tropical low caused widespread power outages, fallen trees and damaged dozens of vehicles. Supercell thunderstorms associated with the system spawned at least two confirmed tornadoes in Beja and Palmela. Extreme street flooding also became prominent in some cities in western Portugal, particularly Setúbal. Winds brought down a radio tower in Senhora do Monte and damage was described as \\"unrepairable\\". Throughout the country, there were 203 reports of fallen trees, 174 reports of minor flooding, 88 structures damaged and 82 roads blocked by debris. Of these reports, 143 were in the Leiria District and 135 were in the Lisbon District. In Spain, the front associated with Alpha caused a train to derail in Madrid, although no one was seriously injured. A woman died in Calzadilla after a roof collapsed on top of her. Alpha also caused lightning storms on Ons Island which led to a forest fire. Naming and records *Alpha is the earliest 22nd Atlantic tropical or subtropical storm, surpassing the old mark of October 17, set by Hurricane Wilma in 2005, and marked the second time in recorded history (joining 2005) that the main naming list has been exhausted and Greek letters were used. * Forming at a longitude of 9.3°W Alpha overtook Tropical Storm Christine of 1973, which formed at 14.0°W as the easternmost-forming tropical or subtropical cyclone on record in the Atlantic. * Upon landfall, Alpha became the first recorded tropical or subtropical cyclone to make landfall in mainland Portugal, and only the third known to have made landfall in continental Europe, following a hurricane in Spain in 1842 and Hurricane Vince (as a tropical depression) in 2005.

He attended elementary school, gymnasium and theological studies in Zadar. Forlani studied theology at Augustineum in Vienna, where he earned his Ph.D. in theology in 1859. There, he was ordained a deacon on 1 December 1856, and a priest on 8 March 1857. In 1857, he started to lecture at the Faculty of Theology, University of Zadar, where he taught the Old Testament and Oriental languages from 1862 until 1866f and church history and canon law from 1866 until 1873. In 1872, he started publishing a magazine in Italian called La Dalmazia cattolica (the Catholic Dalmatia), of which he was a publisher and editor-in-chief. However, already in the second issue, some articles were written in Croatian. Since September 1878, the magazine had bilingual title La Dalmazia cattolica - Katolička Dalmacija. The magazine had a religious- political profile and became the most significant Catholic voice in Dalmatia. On 6 May 1872 Pope Pius IX appointed him Auxiliary Bishop of Split-Makarska and a Titular Bishop of Comana in present-day Turkey. He was consecrated on 17 November 1872 in Split by Bishop Marko Kalogjera. As a papal visitor, he officially visited the Franciscan parishes and monasteries in Herzegovina between 1878 and 1879, after which he went to Vienna and Rome, to inform the Austrian-Hungarian government and the Pope about his findings. While in Rome, he was appointed Bishop of Kotor on 12 May 1879. To make up for the lack of priests in the diocese, he initiated the opening of a seminary for priestly education. Forlani was first to preach in Croatian in Kotor. He died in Donja Lastva near Tivat.

The annual rent was set at 50 shillings and two fat capons each Christmas to the Lord Mayor of Dublin. When the lease ran out in 1974 the value of the land had increased to millions of pounds.The Irish Times 13 February 1974 page 20 Jonathon Amory Jonathon Amory was born in Bristol on 14 March 1654. His father was a merchant and the family had land holdings in County Kerry. Amory is recorded as the purchaser from the city of part of the north strand of the river Liffey. This land was tidal and a mud flat.The Irish Times 9 April 2003 page 3 “It is also ordered and agreed upon, by the authoritie aforesaid, that Jonathan Amory, merchant, shall have a lease of that part of the Strand on the north side of the river Liffey, situate, betwixte the wall of the Pill, in the possession of the lord Sangtry and the water mill lately built by Mr. Gilbert Mabbot, conteining in breadth at the west end, along the lord Santrys wall, and from the wall there lately built by the lord Power, earle of Tyrone, in the north, to the low water marke in the south, the number of eight perches or thereabouts, and in length eastward to the cross wall over against Dirty lane, alias Hog Lane, fiftie four perches or thereabouts; at which place it conteins in breadth, from the earle of Tyrone his wall in the north, to the low water marke in the south, eleven perches or thereabouts, then leaving two perches for a passage or way to the ford and Dirty lane, and also leaving sixtie foot for a highway thence all along to the corner of the wall beyond the said mill, built by the said Mr Mabbott, it conteines in breadth at the west end the number of sixteen perches or thereabouts, to the low water mark in length eastward to the ferry, over against Mr Hawkshaw his buildings, seventie two perches or thereabouts leaving sixtie foot for highway as aforesaid, from which place it is further in length eastward, a little beyond the said mill, sixtie perches or thereabouts, Which is the furthest extent eastward, and at this end it is in breadth, from the sixtie foot left for a highway to the low water marke, fourteen perches and a half, or thereabouts, for the tearme of two hundred ninetie nine yeares, at the yearly rent of fiftie shillings, sterling, to be paid to the treasurer of the cittie for the use of the cittie, and a couple of fatt capons, or five shillings, sterling, in liew thereof, every Christmas to the Lord Mayor of the cittie for the time being”. The grant extended almost in length and amounted to about . The land is described in terms of local landmarks, none of which are visible in the maps of Dublin drawn by John Rocque starting in 1756. The width of the stretch of land, described in perchs, was based on the high and low watermarks of the Liffey. The length of a perch was , today it is . Humphrey Jervis In 1676 the beneficial ownership in the lease passed to Humphrey Jervis. Although Amory’s name remained attached to the lease he faded out of the story and Jervis went on to build two bridges over the Liffey and became a very successful developer.Dublin : Peter Somerville-Large page 127 Jervis was one of the sheriffs of Dublin at the time the lease was granted. He was later elected Lord Mayor and received a knighthood. Jervis Street in Dublin runs north from the Liffey through part of the land described in the grant. The building of quay walls turned the tidal mud flats into valuable development land. The exact relationship between Jervis and Amory is difficult to establish. However, a connection may be established from the will of a David Houston. In this will Jervis and a Mr. Glandys were appointed to assist Houston's widow, Rebecca, in managing his affairs. A marriage licence application exists between Jonathon Amory and Rebecca Houston on 31 May 1677. The licence mentions John Glandys. Amory after the grant The marriage of Amory and Rebecca Houston produced at least two children. Judith Amory was baptised on 1 April 1680. Thomas Amory was baptised on 12 May 1682. Sometime after the birth of Thomas the family, Jonathon, Rebecca, Judith, Thomas and Ann Houston, Rebecca’s daughter, departed Ireland for the West Indies. It is believed that Rebecca died in Barbados sometime around 1685. Jonathon then married Martha. Most sources do not give a surname for Martha but one suggests Schenking. https://www.ancestry.com.au/genealogy/records/sarah- amory-24-21034q3?geo_a=r&geo;_s=au&geo;_t=au&geo;_v=2.0.0&o;_iid=41020&o;_lid=41020&o;_sch=Web+Property Sometime before 1691 Jonathon arrived in the Province of Carolina. By November 1691 he was a known inhabitant of Charleston or Charles Town. In 1692 Jonathon Amory was returned as a member for Berkley County to the assembly of Carolina. He was elected speaker and is noted for presiding over them as they prepared a statement of grievances and of their claims under the Provincial Constitution. Jonathan Amory, Speaker, signs this first American Bill of Rights. In 1696 as Speaker he signed the address to Governor Archdale on the occasion of the governor’s return to England. In 1697 Jonathon was appointed Advocate General in South Carolina under commission from the King. He was also Public Treasurer. Amory died in Charles Town, Carolina in 1699 from “a most infectious and detrimental distemper”. Soon afterwards his wife Martha died having settled the distribution of Jonathon’s will in favour of his three children still living: Thomas (grandfather of Thomas Coffin Amory), Robert and Sarah. There is no mention in the will of any land in Dublin.

She was the first female graduate of the University of Western Australia Law School. The year following graduation she was admitted as a legal practitioner in Western Australia and commenced practice, becoming the first Western Australian woman admitted to legal practice in Western Australia who practised in the state. She was also the first graduate of the University of Western Australia to be admitted to legal practice in that state.  Early life  Enid Russell was born on 10 March 1904 in Perth, the daughter of lawyer Charles Townsend Russell, originally from Victoria, and his wife Adelaide (née Jones), from Albany. She was the older of two children, a son being born at some time in the next seven years. The young Enid first came to public notice at the age of some three years, at the wedding of her father's sister in South Perth. The newspaper report of the wedding enthused that \\"[t]he bride was attended by her tiny neice (sic), Enid Russell, who wore a pretty white muslin frock, inlet with French Valencennes lace, and hat to match. She carried a basket of pink roses and maiden hair fern. She also wore a necklet, a gift from the bridegroom\\". Enid's family experienced a major change with the sudden death of her father when she was about seven years old. Charles Russell was a senior partner with the respected firm Haynes, Robinson & Cox in Howard Street, Perth, having originally joined the firm in Albany where he met his wife. Russell had a history of heart disease, and this condition had become worse earlier in 1911, leading him to consult a specialist in Eastern Australia. He died suddenly after a game of golf near the family home in South Perth, and was much mourned by family and within the Perth legal community. Enid attended Perth Central Girls' School for the primary school phase of her education, and was then successful in gaining, through examination, admission and a scholarship to Perth Modern School, a government-run academic excellence institution which had opened five years earlier. Enid Russell was regularly mentioned in the local press as she grew up, engaging in the kind of social and educational pursuits typical of a girl from her social background. At the age of about 13 she was recorded as having achieved a Grade IV Pass in Theory of Music, an extracurricular course examined through the local university. A year or so later she took part in a summer lifesaving class organized by the South Perth Juvenile Swimming Club, and was awarded a Bronze Medallion at the subsequent examination; and at about the same time she was noted as being placed in a swimming event for her school, holding their annual swimming carnival in the Swan River at Claremont. She matriculated from Perth Modern School in 1921 with passes in English, French, German, Mathematics and History.  Beginning legal career, 1922–1935  Russell initially studied commercial office practice for a year before commencing work as a typist at her father's former law firm, now renamed Robinson, Cox & Wheatley. Over several years she also undertook a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Western Australia, completing it in 1927. In the meantime, however, she persuaded her employer's firm to allow her to become an articled clerk, the means by which a legal practitioner became qualified in the days before university studies were available, and this arrangement commenced on 15 March 1926. Russell was the first woman in Western Australia to enter an articled clerkship; but with the commencement of the Law School at the University of WA in 1928 she then added a Bachelor of Laws degree to her resume, completing that in 1930. As a result of her articles and her law degree, Russell was admitted as a legal practitioner in Western Australia on 17 March 1931, the first woman to be so admitted on the basis of studies completed in Western Australia, and the first to actively practice as a solicitor following her admission. (Alice Mary Cummins had been admitted to practice in Western Australia in 1930 on the basis of qualifications completed in South Australia, but she never entered legal practice). Russell continued to work for Robinson, Cox & Wheatley for the next several years. In 1934, Russell began to indulge her desire to travel, moving to London and obtaining employment as a stenographer with the Agent-General for Western Australia. In October 1934 she was seconded to the ultimately unsuccessful Secession Delegation sent by the state government to present to the British government the results of the 1933 Secession Referendum held in that state, being the only female member of the delegation. Russell served as Secretary to the delegation, her role including the organization of a dinner for Western Australians in London in celebration of King George V's Silver Jubilee. The official report to the Western Australian Parliament at the conclusion of the delegation gave an appreciation of her work.  Hiatus from the law – London and South Africa, 1936–1945  Following her participation in the secession delegation, Russell continued to work in London, from where, later that year, she sent a contribution for the proposed memorial to one of her mentors at the University of WA, Professor Edward Shann, who had recently died in Adelaide in unclear and controversial circumstances. Newspaper reporting about Russell's time in London is illustrative of social attitudes of the time towards professional women. Frequently her name occurs not in news items but in gossip columns, and despite being in her thirties she is often referred to as a \\"Perth girl\\". She was said to have been \\"working her way\\" while in London, hinting that it might be considered remarkable that a woman not be overseas simply enjoying a vacation. Her employment in London was varied, and seems not to have been in legal firms, probably because of the work required to be admitted to practice in England. One role she filled was as secretary to a radio broadcaster and author of children's books. After being hosted at a number of \\"delightful farewell parties from informal Australians and formal English\\", Russell left London in August 1937 and travelled to South Africa, ostensibly for a stay of a few months with the intention of returning to Perth by January 1938. However, she remained in South Africa and by May 1938 had taken a position as Secretary to the Board of the Aero Club of South Africa in Johannesburg,, a role which enabled her to travel extensively in southern Africa including the Rhodesias and other territories neighbouring South Africa. Her return to Perth, repeatedly postponed as she took each new opportunity, was significantly delayed by the outbreak of World War II in 1939. Unable to travel home, Russell enlisted in the South African Women's Army Corps. In the army, she specialised in the new technology of radar, rising to the rank of Lieutenant by the war's end.  Return to Western Australia and the law, 1945–1958  Following the war, Russell finally returned to Perth and re- entered legal practice, at the same time being engaged by the University of WA Law School to lecture on a part-time basis between 1946 and 1951. She lectured in Private International Law, as well as serving as the Law School's librarian. She also worked on the editorial committee of the Law School's Annual Law Review, which commenced publication in 1948, and contributed an article to its second issue a year later. In 1950, Russell was granted a year's leave from her position in the Law School as well as a grant of £800 ($1600) to research and write a history of the law in Western Australia. This project was intended in the first place to be submitted for her to qualify for the degree of Master of Laws, and later to be published. During this time she completed a significant amount of the research and drafted many chapters, but in the end this work was set aside and not completed or published during her lifetime. However, arising out of this research, she did deliver a paper to the Western Australian Historical Society, \\"Early Lawyers of Western Australia\\", which was subsequently published in the Society's annual journal and proceedings. Russell was involved in a variety of women's community roles. In 1950 alone she was mentioned as the honorary secretary of the University of WA Women's University College Fund Committee, involved in raising funds to assist women in attending the university; and as a Commissioner of the Girl Guide movement in Western Australia. In 1951, Russell left Perth and commenced working as a solicitor in the practice of Alec Edwin Ball in the Western Australian country town of Harvey, jointly with another solicitor taking over the practice towards the end of the year as Ball prepared to take up a non- legal educational appointment. While at Harvey she continued to involve herself in the local community such as through work with the Girl Guides. She continued to work for several more years at Harvey, but by 1958 she had been diagnosed with cancer, and so she returned to South Perth where she had grown up, working when she was well enough in the Perth firm Downing & Downing. She died on 24 September 1958, at the age of only 54 years. She was buried in Karrakatta Cemetery in Perth. Throughout her professional life she had worked to promote university education for women, and her estate especially endowed the University of WA with funds for the establishment of a women's college.  Legacy  The major publication of her professional life, which remained incomplete at her death, was A History of the Law in Western Australia. Some twenty years after her death, this book was edited and completed by two Perth barristers and was published by University of Western Australia Press as part of the WAY 79 celebrations of Western Australia's sesquicentenary in 1979.Western Australia, 1829–1979 : a report on the celebrations to the Parliament of Western Australia by the 150th Anniversary Board.

The focus of his scientific work was on the ecophysiology of wild and cultivated plants as well as lichens. He investigated heat, frost and drought resistance of lichens, bryophytes and vascular plants growing under extreme environmental conditions. Life and education Otto Lange was born in Dortmund on 21 August 1927. His family moved to Göttingen, where he went to school. Lange was drafted into the German army at age 16, and became a prisoner of war. This experience affected him greatly as a young man, and later in life he supported anti-war activism. After his return home, he studied biology, chemistry and physics at the Universities of Freiburg and Göttingen. It was from this latter institution that he earned his doctorate degree in 1952, defending a thesis titled \\"Heat and drought tolerance of lichens in relation to their geographic distribution\\". His supervisor was Franz Firbas. He also took the state examination for teaching at secondary schools. In 1959 he earned his habilitation in botany. From 1961 to 1963 he was a scientific advisor at the Technische Universität Darmstadt, where he worked as an Associate Professor in the research group of . From 1963 to 1967 he held the chair for Forest Botany and Technical Mycology at the University of Göttingen and was responsible for the Forestry Botanical Garden and Arboretum there. From 1967 Lange was Professor of Botany at the University of Würzburg, and also Chair of Plant Ecology, which included the management of the botanical garden. Lange retired in 1992. He was married to the biologist Rose (née Wilhelm), and they had two daughters. Lange died on 14 August 2017 in Würzburg. Career =Teaching= Lange taught general botany, forest botany, forest genetics, plant systematics, general ecology, ecophysiology, vegetation and plant sociology at the universities of Göttingen, Darmstadt and Würzburg. He carried out identification exercises for higher plants, mosses, fungi and lichens, and supervised experimental internships and excursions. He has taught as a visiting scholar at Utah State University, in Australia at Australian National University, and in China at Lanzhou University. Doctoral students Lange has supervised include Ludger Kappen, , Roman Türk and . Lichenologists Thomas Nash and Allan Green have spent considerable time in his laboratory as guest researchers. =Research= During Lange's 25 years at the University of Wurzburg he alternated long periods in the field with work analysing results back at the lab and writing scientific papers. The aim of his ecological- botanical research was to quantitatively record the behavior and reactions of wild and cultivated plants, as well as of lichens in their outdoor locations in the interplay with their environment. Possibility of existence, distribution and productivity as a result of their morphological properties and their physiological functions were analyzed and causally interpreted. The water balance and photosynthetic carbon gain were a focus of interest. A constant change between measurements and experiments in the field and working under controlled conditions in the laboratory, for example in climatic chambers, was characteristic of such ecophysiological investigations. His research focused on plants and lichens in extreme growth areas from the Antarctic to the tropical rainforest in Panama. His investigations were both basic research and applied aspectd, such as irrigation cultures in desert areas (e.g. in the Negev desert in Israel), work on forest damage caused by air pollutants, or the analysis of \\"biological soil crusts\\" as protection against erosion in arid areas. As exact ecophysiological metabolic measurements on plants under field conditions require a specially designed measurement method, Lange set up mobile field laboratories to continuously record photosynthesis and transpiration in plants. In cooperation with specialist companies (in particular, Heinz Walz GmbH), Lange developed special instruments, for example, air-conditioned cuvettes, and \\"porometers\\" to determine gas exchange and diffusion resistance of plants and lichens. =Publications= Lange was editor and co-editor of (Photosynthetica (1967–1995), Oecologia (1970–2007), Flora (1964–), Biochemie und Physiologie der Pflanzen, Trees (1986–1998), Botanica Acta(1987–91)),as well as the book series (Ecological Studies, Man and the Biosphere Programme) and specialist books (e.g. 4 volumes of the Encyclopedia of Plant Physiology: Physiological Plant Ecology, Springer-Verlag 1981–1983). = Memberships = 1976–1981: \\"Board of Trustees of the Academy for Nature Conservation and Landscape Management\\", Munich / Laufen 1981–1988: Founder and spokesman of the Würzburg DFG research group \\"Ecophysiology\\" 1982–1989: Founding member and advisory board member of the “Bavarian Forest Toxicology Research Group” of the Bavarian State Ministry for Education and Culture 1987–1990: Chairman of the \\"Arid Ecosystems Research Center\\" of the Hebrew University Jerusalem (Israel) 1989–1991: Speaker of the DFG Collaborative Research Center 251 at the University of Würzburg \\"Ecology, Physiology and Biochemistry of Plant Performance under Stress\\" Recognition =Honours and awards= *1967: The United States Board on Geographical Names named a -high mountain in the Admiralty Range, South Victoria Land, Antarctica, as \\"Lange Peak\\" in recognition of the research on lichen ecology at the American Hallet Station, South Victoria Land *1972: Member of the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina *1974: Antarctic Service Medal from the United States Government *1978: Member of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities *1978: Member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities *1984: Federal Cross of Merit 1st Class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany *1986: Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize together with , for contributions to photosynthesis *1988: Balzan Prize for \\"applied botany including ecology\\" together with Michael Evenari, Hebrew University Jerusalem, *1988: Honorary member of the *1989: Member of the Academia Europaea, London *1990: Adalbert Seifriz Prize for Technology Transfer (Stuttgart), together with master electrician Heinz Walz, Effeltrich *1991: Academia Scientiarum et Artium Europaea, Salzburg, Austria *1991: Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art *1991: Honorary member of the British Lichen Society *1992: Honorary member of the Gesellschaft für Mykologie und Lichenologie *1992: Acharius Medal of the International Association for Lichenology [6] *1993: Honorary member of the Society for Ecology *1994: Foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences *1995: Honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Biology, Chemistry and Earth Sciences at the University of Bayreuth *1996: Honorary Doctorate from the Technical University of Lisbon *2001: Honorary Doctorate from the Technical University of Darmstadt *2002: Honorary member of the German Botanical Society *2007: Eminent Ecologist Award from the Ecological Society of America *2012: Fellow of the Ecological Society of America *2014: Medal \\"Bene Merenti in Gold\\", in recognition of services to the University of Würzburg *2015: Cothenius Medal of the Leopoldina, for his outstanding botanical life's work Ecological Studies Volume 100 was dedicated to Otto Lange’s retirement, while special volumes in lichenological journals also celebrated his 70th and 80th birthdays. =Eponymy= The lichen species Peltula langei , Hubbsia langei and Jackelixia ottolangei , as well as the genus Langeottia were named after Otto Ludwig Lange.

Background On 21 February 2019, a Joint Defence Agreement (JDA) signed between Oman and the United Kingdom mandated the creation of a joint training area to facilitate military training between the British and Omani militaries. The two countries had shared close cultural, economic and military ties since the 1970 Omani coup d'état which saw Qaboos bin Said installed as the Sultan of Oman with significant British support. The JDA was considered by some foreign policy analysts to be an attempt by the then-terminally ill Sultan to make institutional arrangements which will outlast his reign and ensure close relations with the UK continue under his successor. The agreement was also the result of intensifying British engagement in the wider region as the country sought to consolidate its global influence after leaving the European Union. The two countries have previously engaged in large-scale military exercises — the largest being Exercise Saif Sareea, which was held in 1986, 2001 and 2018. History The training area opened sometime during 2019. Prior to opening, an exercise, named Exercise Khanjer Oman 19, was held to test its viability in March 2019. The exercise involved the British Army's Royal Tank Regiment, 1st Armoured Infantry Brigade and supporting units, such as No. 659 Squadron AAC and was concluded a success. Located within the Ras Madrakah training area near the Omani port town of Duqm, the Omani-British Joint Training Area is the largest training area used by the British Army — larger than both the British Army Training Unit Suffield (BATUS) in Canada and the Salisbury Plain Training Area (SPTA) in the United Kingdom. It enables a permanent British Army presence within the region, working closely with the UK Joint Logistics Support Base (UKJLSB) in the nearby Al Duqm Port & Drydock.

The rebellion began after the government of Denmark-Norway ordered that the farmers of Lærdal had to do compulsory military service in addition to compulsory labor on The Bergen King's Road. The farmers in Lærdal had been exempted from military service due to the heavy duty work on the stretch of road that went from Lærdal over the mountain pass know as Filefjell and to the district of Valdres. The rebellion lasted for two years and the rebels was defeated on 9 July 1802 when the government sent an army of 500 men led by Lieutenant Wilhelm Jürgensen, to Lærdal to crush the rebellion. Lysne was then captured, and he was sentenced to death and beheaded in June 1803 in Bergen. Lysne was around the age of 41 when he was executed. Lysne was the only leader of the revolt that was sentenced to death. The other leaders of the uprising were sentenced to imprisonment. After the uprising, the farmers military service was organized as the Lærdal Light Infantry Company and its first commander was Wilhelm Jürgensen.

Personal life He was born on 20 October 1942 in Pinnarawa village, Badulla as the youngest in a family with five siblings. He has three elder sisters and two elder brothers. His father was Romiel Perera and mother was Nanda Perera. When Hemapala was three years old, his parents admitted him to the primary section of the convent in the village with the intention of providing him with an education. He had been studying the alphabet for about a year, and had the opportunity to enter the first year at the age of four. At that time, the first children admitted to the first grade were given the required immunizations at school. Hemapala was also given the same immunizations on the day of the school holidays. Hemapala was poisoned by the vaccine and as a result, spots appeared all over his body. He was later admitted to the Badulla Hospital where he was treated for poisoning. The doctors decided to give 24 injections at the hospital. All wounds were cut with scissors. After about 12 injections, the flesh began to appear and cover in one eye. Chloroform was applied and three operations were performed on the eyes. But unfortunately the drug also poisoned his body and he lost his sight. At the age of nine, both eyes became blind. With a sudden illness, his education was disrupted. In 1975, Hemapala met his wife Kusuma Perera who is from Venivelkola village in Kahathuduwa. She was a fan of him where she sent letters to him. Later they met, got to know each other and got married in 1976. The couple has one daughter and one son. Career Although there was no one involved in music at Hemapala's house, he realized that his elder brother had brought some musical instruments and was preparing to learn music. At that time, Hemapala was listening intently as his brother practiced music at night. Hemapala had the ability to play musical instruments such as the flute, mouth organ and the Japanese mandolin. It was his father who developed that self-taught knowledge and later made him a talented musician. At that time his elder brother was studying music with under J.M. Amaratunga, who was the son of Sadiris Master. His father brought Amaratunga home and taught classical music to Hemapala. He first learned the tabla from that teacher. He did not try to teach new musical instruments. He taught Hemapala to play the musical instruments he know on an academic level. Amaratunga taught him to recognize vocal chords, the differences between rhythmic, simple and classical music, and how to use them in society. Hemapala learned music from him for eleven years until 1964. Although Hemapala could not watch the movies, his music teacher Amaratunga took him to watch the movie 'Dulari' and told the story from beginning to end. However, Amaratunga was a little strict and after a while there were various disputes between teacher and Hemapala. So in 1964, Hemapala left the teacher. In the meantime, he received a scholarship to study music further, but he missed that opportunity too. However, he met the famous musician Ananda Perera, through a friend. After recognizing Hemapala's talents, Ananda introduced him to Prof. Ediriweera Sarachchandra. Later, Sarachchandra recorded a band he played and gave it to Neville Jayawardena, the then director of the radio station. With that, Hemapala got the opportunity to go on the radio. On September 28, 1968, at 10.15 pm, the first radio broadcast of Hemapala's flute music was played. In 1969, there was a rating in the academic section of the radio. At that time Hemapala was the only excellent flautist in Sri Lanka. In 1975, a re-ranking was done and he got the same situation as before. At that time he was the only radio player to present classical music on five different instruments. Hemapala also introduced the tradition of playing Hindustani theatrical music on guitar and mandolin to Sri Lanka for the first time. After graduation, he received a half-hour program each month and got the opportunity to participate in music concerts organized by the radio. In the year 1977, he came to live in Colombo. In the meantime he met Chandrika Siriwardena's husband, Anton Alwis. Upon his introduction, the later president Ranasinghe Premadasa gave him a house on Malwatta Road, Colombo in 1979. At the same time, Hemapala met popular songstress Sujatha Aththanayaka where he involved in her first recordings. Also, when he met Sarath Dassanayake and Stanley Peiris, he became a popular flautist in Sri Lankan music industry. He also did a one-man show called Sangeeth Bhawana. In 1986, C.S. Jayasekara invited him to teach the subject of flutes at the University of the Aesthetics. He worked there for about twenty years. But later he left the teaching due to protests from various people. On 30 June 2016, the musical program Sathsara Ananda featuring Hemapala Perera playing the flute was held on June 30 at 6.30 pm at the Ananda Samarakoon Studio of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC). He is also a Lecturer at the University of the Visual and Performing Arts and the University of Sri Jayewardenepura.

Located in the McKinley Park neighborhood, the statue was designed by Charles Mulligan and dedicated in 1905.  History  William McKinley was an American politician who served as the 25th President of the United States, first being elected in 1896. In 1901, he was assassinated in Buffalo, New York, during a world's fair held in the city. Following his death, there was a period of national mourning, and in Chicago, park commissioners acquired the site of the former Brighton Park Race Track for the purposes of converting it to McKinley Park in honor of him. In 1902, it was decided that a statue of McKinley should be present in the park, and in an effort to save money, park officials decided to recast an old statue of Christopher Columbus that had been erected in Grant Park during the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. From its debut, the statue had been criticized from an aesthetics standpoint, and by 1897, it had been relocated to a place of storage in Washington Park. While the town of Menasha, Wisconsin had offered to take the statue from the city, park officials ultimately decided to recast 10 tons of bronze from that statue into the McKinley statue, reducing the cost from $6,000 to $3,500. The monument, designed by sculptor Charles Mulligan, was dedicated on July 4, 1905. Federal judge Peter S. Grosscup gave a speech at the ceremony.

Named the as the country's first 'pistol robber', his life was later adapted into the country's first drama movie: 'The pistol robber Sadakichi Shimizu' (1899) and then the 1930's adaptation 'Sadakichi Shimizu'.  Biography  Shimizu was born on August 13, 1837 in Kiyoshima-cho, Asakusa in Edo, during the Tenpō era (present-day Taitō, Tokyo).According to the description of the family register on p. 158 of \\"Detective True Story Shimizu Sadakichi\\" (Anonymous, Kinsho-do , 1893). Japan in 1837 adopted the \\"Kansei calendar\\", which is different from the current \\"August 13\\". The age of death is calculated. By profession, he was an anma practicioner based in Tokyo City's Honjo-ku prefecture (present-day Ryōgoku in Sumida). At the time, his job served as good camouflage for his later crimes.Honjo Ryogoku by Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, archived on Aozora Bunko [in Japanese] Beginning in 1882, he would mask himself and rob people around Tokyo City, killing five in the process by shooting them with a handgun. It was the first case in Japanese criminal history where pistol was used, and it shook the capital at that time. Immediately after breaking into a merchant's home in Bakurocho, Nihonbashi-ku (present-day Nihonbashikurocho in Chūō), he was arrested at dawn on December 3, 1886. At that time, one of the arresting officers, Ogawa, was shot and seriously injured, but managed to recover and was promoted assistant police officer second class. However, his injury worsened four months later, and on April 26, 1887, he died at 24 years of age. In September of that year, the 50-year-old Shimizu was sentenced to death and subsequently executed. In order to honor Officer Ogawa, a bridge crossing the Hamamachi River was named after him. It was eventually dismantled by city planning, but in 1974, a stone monument was errected on the anniversary of his death.See the description of the \\"Ogawabashi\\" trace inscription (built in 1974). There is a copy of the inscription in \\"Origin of Ogawabashi\\" on the \\"viva! Edo\\" site.  Theater play  At the time, newspapers serialized the incident in the form of reading material.

The Adonis bears the signature of Duquesnoy, and the statue, created around an ancient torso, should be indeed accepted as \\"a veritable artistic creation [of Duquesnoy].\\" It depicts Adonis, the mortal lover of the goddess Aphrodite in Greek mythology. The backward tilt of the figure is reminiscent of Duquesnoy's bronze Mercury. The sculpture is housed at The Louvre in Paris. Subject The subject of the sculpture is Adonis, offsrping of the incestuous love between Myrrha and her own father, the king of Cyprus. Myrrha tricked her own father into having coitus with her, but he discovered her identity and chased her with a sword. Myrrha then pleaded to the gods, who transformed her into a myrrh tree. In the tree form, she gave birth to Adonis. Aphrodite found the infant; she was charmed by its beauty, put it into a box (according to tradition) and sent it to Persephone. Adonis grew up to be a youth of remarkable beauty, causing Aphrodite and Persephone, who now refused to let him go, to fight over him. Zeus eventually decreed that Adonis would spend one third of the year in the Underworld with Persephone, one third of the year with Aphrodite, and a third of the year with whomever he wished. According to Ovid'd first-century telling of the myth, Adonis was then deadly wounded by a wild boar while hunting. According to Ovid, he bled to death in Aphrodite's arms.* In different versions of the story, the boar was sent by Ares, who was jealous of Adonis because Aphrodite was spending too much time with the mortal or, as hinted at by Euripides, by Artemis, who wanted revenge against Aphrodite for killing her favourite Hippolytus. (Adonis, as a hunter, ventured into the woods and crossed the border into Artemis' realm, and was thereupon killed by a boar). Background and sculpture Duquesnoy's completion of ancient sculptures was acclaimed by his contemporaries as 'absolutely perfect.' One notable example of his work, beside the Adonis, is his Rondanini Faun. Antique statues were often permeated with the Baroque style by the contemporary artist who carried out the work in the 17th century. In the case of the Adonis, completed, as the Rondanini Faun, from an ancient torso, the graceful tilt of the subject is reminiscent of Duquesnoy's Mercury, which, in turn, showcases both Duquesnoy's vision and the Baroque influence of his day. The statue of the Adonis is an original composition by Duquesnoy, bearing his signature. Indeed, according to the Comité français d'histoire de l'art, the opus \\"must be accepted as a veritable artistic creation [of Duquesnoy].\\" The statue is also known as Adonis Mazarin, due to its having been being part of the collection of Cardinal Mazarin. The statue became then part of Marquis de La Meilleraye, Duc de Mazarin's collection. The latter mutilated the sculpture in a fit of madness in the late 17th century.

Porter, featuring a naive spectator trying to interact with films projected onto a screen. It is an almost identical remake of a British 1901 film directed by Robert W. Paul, The Countryman and the Cinematograph (AKA: The Countryman's First Sight of the Animated Pictures). This film was the first to feature a film shown within a film.Review and link to watch the film: Plot A man is sitting in a box at a cinema theatre. The screening starts with the title The Edison Projecting Kinetoscope followed by the intertitle Parisian Danger showing a girl dancing the can-can. The man jumps out of his box and starts imitating her dance. The second intertitle, The Black Diamond Express then appears and the film shows a train rushing towards the camera. The man is so afraid that he jumps back in his loge. The third film, The Country Couple, is then shown and when the spectator sees a couple kissing, he goes back on stage and tears up the screen, revealing the movie projector and projectionist behind it. The projectionist stands up a gives the spectator a beating. Analysis There are a number of differences between this film and the British original. Firstly, it is the third of a series of films directed by Edwin S. Porter featuring the character of Uncle Josh, played by Charles Manley. The other were, in 1900, Uncle Josh's Nightmare and Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel. Uncle Josh Weathersby was a character, created onstage by Cal Stewart, who lived in a mythical New England farming town called \\"Punkin Center\\". Edison had recorded several cylinders of Cal Stewart's very successful speeches and songs before producing these films. The staging of Porter's version is a bit different from the 1901 version, with a slightly wider frame showing a stage with a box to the left and larger than life characters on the screen while they are lifesize in the 1901 version. Porter's version, to the difference of the 1901 film, includes a title and three intertitles for the three films within the film. The general title The Edison Projecting Kinetoscope is a kind of advertisement for this innovation recently introduced by Edison to replace the Kinetoscope parlors, following the success of the Lumière brothers' cinematograph. The second film within the film is a clear reference to the Lumière brothers' 1895 film, L'Arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat (known in the United States as The Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station, Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat or The Arrival of the Mail Train, and in the United Kingdom as Train Pulling into a Station) and the panic reaction it allegedly caused in the audience. right Porter used double exposure to add the films after having filmed the spectator next to a black background. This also made it possible to use the same actor as spectator and actor in the third film where he wants to confront his Doppelgänger. At the end, stop-motion is used to replace the black background by a white sheet which is torn by the spectator. This film and the British film which inspired it have been regarded as a celebrated document of the learning process of the public regarding cinema: \\"The proper relations among viewers, projector and the screen, the peculiar dimensions of cinematic space, were part of a cultural practice that had to be learned\\".Miriam Hansen, Babel and Babylon, Harvard University Press, p.25.

It is located along the Lahti–Kouvola line, and its neighboring stations are Lahti in the west and Nastola in the east.  History  = 1st station = The station of Villähde was originally opened in the year 1888 to serve the western areas of the parish of Nastola, by the initiative of the locals. The Class V station building was completed in the same year, and its location was seen as optimal to serve . After the second World War, a car chassis factory as well as a furniture workshop were founded in Villähde. However, upon the foundation of the Lankila and Haravakylä halts (in 1940 and 1945, respectively), the number of passengers at Villähde began to dwindle due to the locations of the halts better serving the population centers in the region. Despite the urban area of Villähde reaching a total population of 1,300 residents by 1970, the station was closed from passengers in the same year and was made unmanned in 1971. Its railyard was disassembled in 1995, and therefore the first operating point of Villähde was officially abolished. = 2nd station = Villähde was reopened in 2009 as a crossover point. After the passenger services of the Nastola area were transferred from Uusikylä to the new Nastola halt in the centre of the municipality in 2005, the municipal council and its residents started once again an initiative to build a station in Villähde. Both stations were subsequently rebuilt and reopened in 2010, which made Nastola home to a total of three active railway stations.  Services  Villähde is served by all commuter trains on the route Lahti–Kouvola, and some of these services are operated from or continue towards Kotka as well. The intermediate stations between Lahti and Kouvola are also served by all but one rush hour service on the route Helsinki–Lahti–Kouvola.

Directed by Godspell co-creator John-Michael Tebelak, with book and lyrics by Bruce Kluger and music by Joe Ercole, the two-act musical told the story of the five sole survivors of a nuclear holocaust that had destroyed the world, who were spared by God so that he could audition them for his new show, Creation, Part Two. Plot Ka-Boom! opens with its characters on their knees, singing in prayer. We quickly discover that they are the five sole survivors of a nuclear war that has destroyed all of humanity. They are: Tony, a showy Las Vegas lounge singer who was performing at the Sands Hotel when the blast hit; Jasmine, a cynical writer whose resume included jobs at The New Yorker and The Village Voice; Hattie, a stripper who was dancing at her burlesque club, The Ka-Boom Room, when the world ended; June, a perky musical-comedy performer who'd just wrapped up her 17th national tour of Oklahoma!; and Matthew, a confused drama student struggling with his identity. Eventually, a fussy angel (Avery) appears and explains to them that they are to audition for God for his planned second Creation, and that, through their performances, they must demonstrate that they can fulfill God's vision of a new and better world. Most of the play's action revolves around the quintet's efforts to stage a group audition, though their first attempts fail, as the characters succumb to their old vices, such as pride and selfishness. Eventually, the five create an entirely new audition piece that reveals the ways in which they have learned and grown. Avery returns, reveals that he is, in fact, God, and announces that all five survivors have earned their place in the new Creation. Musical numbers The Ka-Boom! score, written by Joe Ercole, was an eclectic collections of songs, ranging in style from jazz and pop to Broadway and gospel. =Act I= * \\"Overture/Prologue\\" (Orchestra) * \\"Now We Pray\\" (Ensemble) * \\"Oh, Lord!\\" (Ensemble) * \\"A Little Bit O' Glitter\\" (Tony) * \\"Maybe For Instance\\" (Jasmine) * \\"With a World to Conquer\\" (Hattie) * \\"Smile\\" (June) * \\"Let Me Believe in Me\\" (Matt) * \\"Believe Us/Receive Us\\" (Ensemble) * \\"A Few Get Through\\" (Jasmine) * \\"The Ballad of Adam and Evie\\" (Tony, Hattie) * \\"Give Me a 'G'\\" (June) * \\"Finale\\" (Ensemble) * \\"Maybe For Instance\\" (Reprise; Jasmine) * \\"The Soft Spot\\" (Tony, Jasmine) * \\"You Are You\\" (Ensemble) * \\"The Light Around the Corner\\" (Ensemble) =Act II= * \\"Believe Us/Receive Us\\" (Reprise; Ensemble) * \\"Those ABC's\\" (June, Ensemble) * \\"Judgement Day\\" (Tony, Ensemble) * \\"Bump and Grind for God\\" (Hattie, Ensemble) * \\"Let Me Believe in Me\\" (Reprise; Matt, Ensemble) * \\"Let the Show Go On!\\" (Avery, Ensemble) Critical reception Ka- Boom! received mostly indifferent to negative reviews.Stasio, Marilyn, \\"It Goes 'Pop,' Not 'Ka-Boom!'\\", New York Post, November 22, 1980.Nelson, Don, \\"Little Bang in Ka-Boom!\\", New York Daily News, November 21, 1980. While some critics admired the show's youthful enthusiasm,Otten, Ted, \\"Fun despite its Flaws\\", 'The Aquarian', December 17–24, 1980. others found the characters and storyline cliché. John S. Wilson of The New York Times described Ka-Boom! as \\"a mixture of Godspell, Jesus Christ Superstar and Babes in Arms, while calling the characters \\"lightly sketched stereotypes\\" and the play itself \\"bogged down in the message of salvation\\" that the creators wanted to deliver. Ka-Boom! closed on January 19, 1981, after a run of 16 previews and 70 performances. Production staff and cast Ka-Boom! was produced by Jim Payne, in association with Sherie Seff and Bruce Kluger.

Joanna Werners (born 1953) is a Dutch writer of Surinamese origin. She is considered a pioneer of Surinamese lesbian literature.  Biography  Werners was born in 1953 in Paramaribo, Suriname. She attended the city's Algemene Middelbare School. At age 18, she moved to the Netherlands, where she worked as a physical education and economics teacher. Her debut book was the autobiographical novel Droomhuid, released in 1987. The book tells the story of a woman who is torn between her love for a black man and a white woman.

Background  MUGULA 1 was first established in 1996as a safe haven for South Sudanese fleeing war in their country, most of whom were women and children. The refugee influx worsened due to prolonged years of war in Sudan for independence of the African south from the predominantly Arab north. Civil conflict between the Dinka and the Nuer resulting from disagreements between President Salva Kiir and his deputy Dr. Riek Macha also contributed to the refugee problem. Insecurity pushed most of the south Sudanese to neighboring countries that were relatively safe.  Social amenities  MUGULA 1 is home to Mugula health center iv, and clean running water. Education facilities includes Aliwara primary school, Mugula primary school and Mungula secondary school. All these serve both the refugees in the settlement and the host community. Challenges Residents of the settlement decry the general health facilities malaise; the long distances to health facilities is worsened by the exorbitant private health clinic fares coupled with poor referral procedures as a result of shortage of ambulances to help in case of emergencies, in addition to lack of sufficient number of health workers. The residents also complain of poor quality education accessed due to a shortage of learning materials, teachers, congestion and language barrier. High tuition fees also hinder many from accessing the required education. Limited access to building materials force many to live in poor shelter, some complain of leaking roofs. Food insecurity is also an issue due to the high cost of renting land for agricultural purposes from the host community. Congestion at water access points and poor latrine coverage are also big challenges.  Positive results There is peace and harmony between the host communities and the residents of the settlement, thus programes targeting refugees also help and support the host community. There are strong leadership structures at the settlement (refugee welfare committees) such as child protection committee, water source committee and gender taskforce to handle problems that may arise. In 2018, there was a farming trial in the camp for almost 5000 refugees to produce their own food.

Oglesby was an American politician and military commander who served in the Union Army during the American Civil War and served multiple terms as Governor of Illinois in the late 1800s. He died in 1899. By December 1916, sculptor Leonard Crunelle was chosen to design a monument honoring him at a cost of $25,000, approved by the Illinois General Assembly. The monument, featuring a bronze sculpture of Oglesby atop a granite pedestal, was dedicated in 1919 in Lincoln Park. Over the next several decades, the statue was subjected to extensive vandalism, including from spray paint graffiti, and around 1990, the granite base was coated in urethane, ostensibly for preservation, but having the unintended consequence of changing the pedestal's cover and making it more susceptible to water damage. In November 1991, the statue was highlighted in an article of the Chicago Tribune that discussed the neglected state of public art in Chicago and interviewed Andrzej Dajnowski, the first sculpture conservator for the Chicago Park District, who talked about repairs that would happen to the sculpture.

He is known for The Primacy of Love (1931), a theological study of love which argued for a rethinking of Catholic approaches to sexuality, chastity and morality. Early life and career August Adam was born on 14 April 1888 in , Upper Palatinate, Germany. His older brother Karl Adam was also a priest and theologian. August Adam was ordained a priest in the Diocese of Regensburg in 1911, and studied first under his brother at the University of Tübingen, then under at the University of Freiburg. He received his doctorate in 1924 with a thesis entitled Arbeit und Besitz nach Ratherius von Verona (Work and Property after Ratherius of Verona). He was denied permission to pursue the necessary qualifications to teach at the university level for reasons that were never explained but likely had to do with his progressive views. Instead, he became a teacher in Straubing, first at a secondary school then at a Gymnasium from 1928 until 1953. The Primacy of Love Adam's best- known work, The Primacy of Love, was published in 1931. In its theological account of love, the book is distinctive for treating love as synonymous with passion, and for its argument that eros is a manifestation of love. Love, Adam argues, should be at the core of Christian morality. Adam argues that sexuality can be a source of spiritual power, and that sins against the commandment \\"Thou shalt not commit adultery\\" are not necessarily more egregious than those against the others of the Ten Commandments. Adam did not downplay the importance of chastity, but saw chastity as the product of love rather than a route to love. Adam argued that morality and immorality cannot be reduced to chastity and unchastity, and that chastity is not the greatest of virtues, nor unchastity the greatest of sins. Adam argues that the question of sexuality should be understood as one part of a broader question: that of the place of Christ in the world. The book was praised in German theological journals and translated into several languages. In a review in Theological Studies, Dietrich von Hildebrand praised The Primacy of Loves account of morality and of the history of the connection between impurity and immorality. Hildebrand criticised Adam, however, for failing to identify love as fundamental in the sexual sphere, despite his emphasis on the primacy of love in morality. The Primacy of Love was controversial in its time: Adam was denied a professorship at the University of Passau by church leaders who were critical of his \\"modernist views on sexuality\\", and the book was only saved from being listed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum after Karl Adam intervened in his brother's favour. Later, however, Pope Benedict XVI described The Primacy of Love as a \\"revolutionary\\" work that influenced him in his youth, and drew on themes from Adam's work in his discussion of eros in the encyclical Deus caritas est (2005). Nazi period Adam belonged to the Bavarian People's Party and was an early critic of the Nazi Party, arguing that its ideology ran counter to Christian teachings, and so became a target of the Nazi regime. His book The Sixth Commandment was denied publication and he was scheduled to be executed in the event of a Nazi victory in the Second World War. During the Nazi period he grew estranged from his brother Karl, who supported the regime. Other work In works including Tension and Harmony: About the Value of Dogma for Personal Life (1940) Adam criticises \\"proper\\" (korrekt) Christians who lack spiritual depth and do not practice Christian virtues in everyday life, and argued that Christians ought not to prioritise conformity to social conventions over the necessity of love. Ulrich L. Lehner argues that this too informed Benedict's Deus caritas est, which warns against becoming \\"proper Christians\\". Tension and Harmony described the tensions and harmonies shaping religious life (for example involving the body and soul, or the natural and supernatural), and argued for the necessity of not overemphasising either side of such dichotomies. In The Virtue of Freedom (1947), Adam argued that in the aftermath of World War II a new conception of freedom, closely associated with virtue and epikeia, was required to overcome totalitarianism. Christ and the Woman (1954) discussed the role of women in the Church. Influence Along with von Hildebrand, Adam contributed to the development of the theology of the body. Lehner argues that Pope Paul VI drew on Adam's work in the encyclical Humanae vitae (1968), as did Pope John Paul II in Theology of the Body (1979–84), though neither mention him by name. Writing in 2007, Lehner described Adam as \\"a prescient moral theologian who, while popular in his own time, is little known today outside academic circles.\\" Lehner elsewhere noted that, while Karl Adam is still widely read in the 21st century, \\"his brother August has been largely elided from the history of theology.\\" Death Adam died on 5 February 1965 and is buried at St. Michael's Cemetery in Straubing.

He played as midfielder. Club career Schnyder first played for Grenchen during the 1955–56 Nationalliga A season, but the club suffered relegation. After the following season Schnyder and his club managed promotion back to the highest flight of Swiss football. Schnyder the moved on to play for Young Boys. He played for them for six seasons and Schnyder won the Swiss Championship three times. Schnyder moved on in the summer of 1964 to play for Servette for two seasons. Schnyder joined FC Basel's first team for their 1966–67 season under player-manager Helmut Benthaus. After playing in three test games, Schnyder played his domestic league debut for the club in the home game at the Landhof on 21 August 1966 as Basel won 1–0 against Lugano. He scored his first goal for his club on 21 May 1967 in the home game as Basel won 4–1 against Biel-Bienne. Schnyder won the Swiss championship title for the fourth time in his personal career at the end of this season. Basel finished the championship one point clear of FC Zürich who finished in second position. Basel won 16 of the 26 games, drawing eight, losing twice, and they scored 60 goals conceding just 20. In the Swiss Cup final, in the former Wankdorf Stadium on 15 May 1967, Basel's opponents were Lausanne-Sports. Helmut Hauser scored the decisive goal via penalty. The game went down in football history due to the sit-down strike that followed this goal. After 88 minutes of play, with the score at 1–1, referee Karl Göppel awarded Basel a controversial penalty. André Grobéty had pushed Hauser gently in the back and he let himself drop theatrically. Subsequent to the 2–1 for Basel the Lausanne players refused to resume the game and they sat down demonstratively on the pitch. The referee had to abandon the match. Basel were awarded the cup with a 3–0 forfait. The following season Schnyder was injured during a test games during the pre-season. Although he recovered within two months and played in two Swiss Cup matches, he did not make it to a league match until March the following year. He played in just eight league matches that season. During his third season with Basel, although he played in the Cup of the Alps and various test matches, he played only one game in the domestic league. Between the years 1966 and 1969 Schnyder played a total of 71 games for Basel scoring a total of four goals. 34 of these games were in the Nationalliga A, nine in the Swiss Cup, eight in the European competitions (European Cup, Cup of the Alps and Inter-Cities Fairs Cup) and 20 were friendly games. He scored one goal in the domestic league, the other three were scored during the test games. Following his time with Basel, Schnyder moved on to lower tier, local club Concordia Basel and ended his active professional football career. International career Schnyder was first called up for the Swiss national team during the spring of 1959. He played for the team in the friendly match on 26 April 1959 as the team lost a friendly match against Yugoslavia. He played two other matches for the country on 26 May 1965 against Germany and on 22 October 1966 against Belgium.

Early life  Dora Mayer was born in Hamburg, Germany, the daughter of Anatol Mayer, a merchant, and Mathilde de Loehrs.The family moved to Callao, Peru in April 1873. Educated at home, Mayer was a motivated autodidact, reading widely, and writing novels, plays, essays, and articles.  Activism  Mayer wrote on women's rights, philosophy, social concerns, and 'extensively in denunciation of the endless abuses of landowners and authorities, and the absence of effective labor legislation' for the indigenous people of Peru. As a journalist, she contributed to numerous publications and edited four herself: El Deber Pro Indígena, La Crítica ,Concordia and El Trabajo. Like many other pro-indigenous activists of the time, Mayer was influenced by Manuel González Prada. In his 1905 manifesto Nuestros Indios (Our Indians), Prada had argued that indigenous Peruvians had been ravaged by exploitation and discriminatory attitudes and practices, rather than inherently doomed by their perceived racial inferiority. In 1909, Mayer co-founded the Asociación Pro-Indígena, or Pro-Indigenous Association, with philosopher Pedro Zulen and sociologist Joaquín Capelo. According to Frank Salomon, the Association worked principally through legal assistance and research, and 'invoked the Indians' status as legally entitled, though disenfranchised, citizens in order to win them such rights as protection from debt imprisonment.' Though 'humanitarian, altruistic, and moral,' the organisation was 'unable to solve the problem of indigenous exploitation'. The group ultimately devolved in 1917. It was, however, a notable precursor to the burgeoning Indigenismo movement, which gained momentum in the 1920s. Mayer was later a supporter of the Tahuantinsuyo Indigenous Rights Committee (active 1919-1925). In 1911, Mayer prepared a paper for the First Universal Races Congress in London concerning the treatment of indigenous people in Peru. The abstract of her paper, as described in a pamphlet produced for the Congress, read in part: > The natives of Peru have been accused of dishonesty, hypocrisy, and > idleness. It is a fact that modern civilisation has corrupted, rather than > improved, them. European employers have done nothing, either from the > material or moral point of view, to uplift and civilise them; on the > contrary, they have merely set them an example of immorality... The > Peruvians, nevertheless, have all the qualities of the cultivator; if they > were given the means of developing these qualities and exploiting the > natural wealth of their soil, it would mean their salvation, and further the > progress of the country. In 1913, in her capacity as President of the Press Committee of the Pro- Indigenous Association, Mayer published The conduct of the Cerro de Pasco mining company. In it, she notes that although the initial operations of the North American mining company were legitimate: > as the company became initiated into the secrets of the judicial and > political habits of the country, it made up its mind to take advantage of > the frailties which unfortunately are to be found in our social system, and > entered fully into the ways of fraud, bribery and violence... We would make > no remark upon the easy corruption of the businessmen who arrived here, if > the Anglo-Saxon peoples did not brag so much about their moral superiority > over the South-Americans and started in their diplomacy from the idea that, > whilst protecting their countrymen in the exterior, they were defending the > cause of civilization and morality. Mayer went on to describe the company's 'inhumane conduct towards the aboriginal workmen' it employed. She was a staunch critic of the abusive or exploitative practices of transnational companies, from both social and environmental angles.  Women's rights  On the role of women in society, Mayer prized the role of the homemaker, but acknowledged the disadvantages for women of domestic work being insufficiently recognised. She argued that: > In the current moment power depends on economic conditions, and in this > respect women once again find themselves at a disadvantage, because their > labor as homemaker is not assigned mercantile value […] It may be > indispensable to give wives and mothers a wage in order to make men > understand that they are not simply ‘giving’ women half of their fortunes, > but rather that work done in the feminine world is as important as that of > the man’s.  Relationship with Pedro Zulen  Pedro Zulen, twenty-two years younger than Mayer but for many years her 'partner in indigenista activism', reportedly rebuffed her romantic advances repeatedly. Nevertheless, she was public in her passion for him, and in published works from 1920 onwards, used the name 'Dora Mayer de Zulen'. This is also the name used on her tombstone.  Death and legacy  Dora Mayer died in Peru on 7 January 1959, at the age of 91. In 2019, philosopher Joel Rojas edited a collection of Mayer's writings entitled The Sun that Dispels the Clouds: Essential texts, and an exhibition was held in Lima about her life and work. In the same year, the National University of San Marcos embarked on a project to digitise Mayer's materials held in their archives.

Life and career Wette was born in Siegburg, Germany, the youngest sister of the composer Engelbert Humperdinck. She is best remembered today as the librettist of his opera Hansel and Gretel, although she also published other works. Her parents were Gustav Humperdinck, a high school teacher, and Gertrud Hartmann Humperdinck, the daughter of a cantor. Adelheid was very interested in reading folktales and writing poetry. In 1881, she married Dr. Hermann Wette who shared her interest in folktales and had himself written two libretti for the composer Arnold Mendelssohn. Every year, Adelheid Wette wrote a play for her children to perform at a family celebration. In 1888, she wrote a version of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, which Engelbert enhanced with some songs. In 1890, she wrote a version of Hansel and Gretel to be performed for her husband's birthday in May. In a letter to Engelbert in April, she asked him to compose music for five of her verses to use in the play: a cock-a-doodle-doo song (Lied); a dance song (Tanzlied); an echo song (Echolied); a forest song (Waldlied); and a lullaby (Schlummerlied). She included rhythmic suggestions for the dance song and suggested a melody of the lullaby. Engelbert responded with an arrangement of songs for two voices and piano.

Founded in 1841 by James Cocker, the company has been owned by the Cocker family for five generations. During the last seventy years, the nursery has introduced more than 100 new rose varieties and holds Royal Warrants from Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, and the Prince of Wales. James Cocker & Sons is best known for creating the hybrid tea rose, 'Silver Jubilee', the popular rose named in honour of the Queen's 25 years reign. The rose was developed by Alec Cocker, and introduced by his wife, Anne Cocker, after Alec's death in 1977. Anne continued to breed roses and manage the compay until she was in her eighties. She won multiple horticultural awards and was internationally recognized for her work. History =1841 to 1929= 'Mrs Cocker' cigarette rose card, 1912 James Cocker & Sons was founded by James Cocker (1807-1880) in 1841 in Aberdeen, Scotland. Cocker established the nursery after he left his job as head gardener at Castle Fraser. Cocker originally sold forest trees and herbaceous plants. He later acquired additional property nearby and set up a seed warehouse on Union Street, in Aberdeen. Cocker's son, James (1832-1897), took over the company when his father died in 1880. Cocker's three sons, William, James and Alexander, joined the company in the 1880s. With the growing popularity of roses, the Cockers initiated a rose breeding program in the early 1890s. After Cocker died in 1897, his three sons took over the management of the company. The nursery's initial rose introductions in 1892, were two sports out of the Hybrid perpetuals, 'Duke of Fife' and 'Duchess of Fife'. The nursery's first commercially successful rose variety was 'Mrs. Cocker' (1899). Alexander became the sole owner of the company after the deaths of his two brothers. Alexander Cocker died in 1920 and the company was put into a trust for his two young children, Margaret and Alexander Morison (Alec) (1907-1977). The nursery was closed in 1923. =1930 to 1977= Alec Cocker reopened the business as a general nursery in 1936. He rented a field in Aberdeen and initially grew perennials and roses. During the Second World War, Cocker joined the Civil Defence Service, where he met Anne Rennie (1920-2014). Cocker and Anne became engaged, and after the war formed a new nursery business using Anne's £80 war grant. The young couple delayed their marriage until 1952, waiting until their new company was thriving. Cocker and Anne expanded their business in 1959, when they bought a larger property on the outskirts of Aberdeen. The Cockers began specialising in breeding new rose varieties in the 1960s. Their first rose varietes include, 'Morning Jewel' (1968), 'Rosy Mantle' (1968) and 'White Cockade' (1969). The hybrid tea, 'Alec's Red' (1970), was awarded the Royal National Rose Society's (RNRS) President's International Trophy in 1970. In 1976, Cocker was granted a Royal Warrant by the Queen. Cocker's' most celebrated rose variety, an apricot blend hybrid tea, 'Silver Jubilee', was named with permission of the Queen to celebrate her 25-year reign. Cocker died of a heart attack in 1977 and did not live to see his rose's success. =1978 to 2020= Anne introduced 'Silver Jubilee' in 1978, the year after Cocker's death. She continued to manage the nursery, and later expanded the business. She was granted Cocker's Royal Warrant as supplier to the Queen of bare root roses. She managed the rose breeding program at the company, creating new rose varieties well into her eighties. Rosa 'Silver Jubilee', 1978 Anne gained an international reputation for her outstanding rose varieties including, 'Remember Me' (1979), 'Braveheart' (1993), and 'Heart of Gold' (2001). Cocker specialised in unusually coloured and patterned rose varieties. In 1995, the Royal Caledonian Horticultural Society awarded Cocker the Scottish Horticultural Medal for outstanding services to Scottish horticulture. In 1999, Cocker was the recipient of the RNRS's most prestigious award, the Dean Hole Medal. In 2001 she was awarded the The Queen Mother's Royal Warrant, thought to be the last Royal Warrant granted by the Queen Mother. Anne died in 2014, at the age of 94.

Cocker and her husband, Alexander Morison Cocker, were owners of the nursery, James Cocker & Sons. From the 1960s to the 2000s, the Cockers introduced more than 100 new rose varieties. Cocker continued to breed roses until her eighties, winning multiple horticultural awards. Early life Cocker was born on 5 May 1920, in a tenement in Aberdeen, Scotland, the daughter of John and Barbara Rennie. Her father worked as a granite mason and draughtsman. Cocker attended Aberdeen Grammar School, while also working at Milne's licensed grocers. After graduating from school, she was hired full-time at the grocers. At the beginning of World War II, Cocker joined the Civil Defence Service, serving as an ambulance driver. Through her volunteer work, she met Alexander Morrison Cocker, a fellow Civil Defense Service volunteer, and the owner of James Cocker & Sons, an Aberdeen nursery. They later became engaged, and after the war formed a new nursery business using Cocker's £80 war grant. The couple delayed their marriage until 1952, waiting until their new company was thriving. Cocker and Alec expanded their business in 1959, when they bought a larger property on the outskirts of Aberdeen. Rose breeding Rosa 'Silver Jubilee', 1978 In the early 1960s, the Cockers decided to specialise in the breeding and growing of new rose varieties. Their early rose breeding successes include, 'Morning Jewel' (1968), 'Rosy Mantle' (1968) and 'White Cockade' (1969). The bright red hybrid tea rose, 'Alec's Red' (1970), won the Royal National Rose Society's (RNRS) President's International Trophy in 1970. In 1976, Alec was granted a Royal Warrant as supplier of the Queen's bare root roses. Alec's most famous new rose variety, 'Silver Jubilee', was named with permission of the Queen to celebrate her 25-year reign. Cochran introduced the new rose variety in 1978, the year after Alec died of a heart attack. After Alec's death, Cocker assumed sole ownership of the nursery, later expanding the business. She continued to develop new rose varieties well into her eighties. Cocker won awards for her successful new rose varieties. She inherited Alec's Royal Warrant, and later served as president of the Aberdeen Association of Royal Warrant Holders. Cocker earned an international reputation for her roses, including 'Remember Me' (1979), 'Braveheart' (1993), and 'Heart of Gold' (2001). Cocker specialised in unusually coloured and patterned rose varieties. Her work had a major influence on Tom Carruth, an American, award-winning rose hybridizer. Rosa 'Alison', 1996 Cocker was appointed Burgess of the Guild of Aberdeen in 1983. In 1995, the Royal Caledonian Horticultural Society awarded Cocker the Scottish Horticultural Medal for outstanding services to Scottish horticulture. In 1999, Cocker was the recipient of the RNRS's most prestigious award, the Dean Hole Medal. In 2001 she was awarded the The Queen Mother's Royal Warrant, thought to be the last Royal Warrant granted by the Queen Mother. In 2009, Cocker was awarded the People's Choice Award, at the Glasgow International Rose Trials, for her hybrid tea rose, 'With All My Love'. Cocker died 21 November 2014, at the age of 94, in Banchory, Scotland. Her son, Alec Cocker Jr. and wife are the current owners of the family rose business.

In October 2016, he accepted the offer of a W3 professorship for ethnology at the Goethe University Frankfurt am Main and became the new director of the Frobenius Institute in January 2017, succeeding Karl-Heinz Kohl.  Research  Hardenberg studies socio-cultural values that form the framework for social action. Based on ethnographic studies in India and Kyrgyzstan, his research aims at understanding local practices that are expressions of shared socio-cosmic ideas. In India and Kyrgyzstan, these include in particular religious practices such as rituals, sacrifices, pilgrimages and burials as well as exchanges that suggest specific conceptions of \\"kinship\\", \\"friendship\\", \\"neighborhood\\", etc. Hardenberg's approach is comparative, with the aim of understanding cultural differences and commonalities. He works with techniques of empirical field research in the context of long-term stays mainly in rural areas of South and Central Asia. His systematic contributions to social and cultural anthropology include topics such as cultural comparison, gift exchange, hierarchy, house societies and 'New Kinship'. In the framework of a Collaborative Research Center (SFB 1070) at the University of Tübingen, Roland Hardenberg, together with other scholars, has developed cultural studies approaches to resources and elaborated concepts such as \\"resource complexes\\" and \\"resource cultures\\". Based on comparative studies of ritual economies, he has coined the term \\"socio-cosmic field\\". His current research interests focus on processes in the handling (production, distribution and consumption) of different millet varieties and on the question of which factors contribute to the rise and decline of millet as a staple food in India and Africa.

London Club  Prior to founding the Shoreditch-based Club, founder, Van Someren ran a motorcycle news blog aggregator under the domain name BikeShedMotorcycleClub.com. The Bike Shed shows were founded in response to the perceived poor quality of British motorcycle exhibitions. Van Someren developed the concept of the private member's club after the their second show was well received. The founders envisaged Bike Shed as \\"Soho House for Bikers\\", attracting a younger demographic than traditional motorcycle-friendly venues.

History  Richard Horgan founded Terry's Foundation for Muscular Dystrophy in 2017, which became Cure Rare Disease in 2018, in order to develop a cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy for his brother who has been battling the disease since childhood. Leveraging his network from Harvard Business School, Horgan formed a collaboration consisting of leading researchers and clinicians around the country to develop this cure for his brother, and eventually founded Cure Rare Disease. Horgan connected first with a scientist at Boston Children's Hospital, Dr. Timothy Yu, who had just successfully created a custom drug for a girl with the neurodegenerative condition, Batten disease using antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) technology. Horgan's brother's mutation is not amenable to ASO technology, so Horgan adopted the process and instead used CRISPR as the technology to attempt to cure his brother.  Research  There are currently two drugs approved by the FDA for Duchenne muscular dystrophy to treat the patients with mutations on the dystrophin gene encompassing exon 51 and 53. However, people with DMD have mutations impacting different exons of the gene, so these do not work to treat all patients. Cure Rare Disease is developing customized therapeutics using CRISPR gene-editing technology. To systemically deliver the therapeutic, CRISPR is inserted into the adeno- associated virus (AAV). Customized to each patient, the drug developed for Rich's brother used a CRISPR transcriptional activator which functions to upregulate an alternative isoform of dystrophin. Because the CRISPR activation technology does not induce a double stranded cut, rather it acts to upregulate the target of interest, there is less risk of introducing an off-target genetic mutation. Through the collaboration with Cure Rare Disease, researchers at Charles River Laboratories, headquartered in Wilmington, Massachusetts, have started to develop animal models with the same genetic mutation as the person to be treated with the drug so that therapeutic efficacy and safety can be shown. Pending the success of this test, Cure Rare Disease will seek approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration to dose Terry with the first-in-human CRISPR transcriptional activator. Beyond the first patient, Cure Rare Disease has assembled patient families who work with the organization to fundraise and support the development of additional customized therapeutics targeting varying mutations causing muscular dystrophy and SCA3, a neurodegenerative condition.

First boxing organisations The first boxing fight that was recorded in New Zealand was in July 1862 in Canterbury between London boxer Harry Jones and local boxer George Barton. It lasted 70 minutes over 30 rounds of bare fisted boxing. A council was formed in 1902 called the New Zealand Boxing Council which was administrated in Christchurch. In 1924 the New Zealand Boxing Association (NZBA) took over as the country's boxing body as the previous body no longer found themselves adequately to control the sport. NZBA moved the headquarters to Wellington. Professional boxing Between 1924 and the 2000s, the NZBA was the leading organisation in both amateur and professional boxing. With the introduction of different boxing organisations, Boxing NZ began to focus solely on amateur boxing. The first recorded New Zealand National professional boxing title was won in 1884 by Harry Laing. The first recorded boxing association champion was Hock Keys in 1905 and Carrie Blackburn in September 1924 after NZBA took over as the country's body. The last person to win the boxing title was Colin Hunia in 2004. But the last contest for the title was in 2006 between Guillermo Mosquera and David Wiremu which ended in a draw. This is all according to BoxRec. Boxing NZ has not commissioned a professional boxing bout since 2011, however they are legally allowed to do so if they wish to. However the days of the Pro-Am events were over when the rise of corporate boxing began and took over New Zealand's boxing industry. Women's boxing NZBA was purely a male sport and was officiated only by male referees and judges. This changed in 1990 with Trish Howie becoming the first New Zealand boxing official in New Zealand. In 1996 the NZBA passed a rule to finally allow women to box in New Zealand. The first women's bout was held in 1997. Nationals and Golden Gloves Boxing NZ holds an annual boxing competition to determine the New Zealand National Boxing Championship, which generally happens within the last quarter of the year. They also host three Golden Gloves events through the year, one for North Island, one for South Island, and finally a National Golden Gloves Championship. The Golden Gloves Championship are separate from the National and generally happen in the middle of the year. The championships first began in 1902.

He specialises in soil physics, agroecology and environmental stewardship.  Early life and education  Ghezzehei was born in Eritrea. He attended the University of Asmara, where he earned an undergraduate degree in 1995. His senior thesis considered the use of prickly pears as compost to reclaim degraded soil. Ghezzhei was a graduate student at Utah State University, where he studied the micromechanics of soil aggregates. As a graduate student Ghezzehei got interested in nature photography, and he spent his spare time in the National Parks of Wyoming. After earning his doctoral degree, Ghezzehei joined the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory as a postdoctoral fellow.  Research and career  Boundary of the Carpenter 1 Fire, 2013 photo by Teamrat Ghezzehei Ghezzehei was eventually promoted to Affiliate scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. His early training involved the physics of fluid flow, and it wasn't until later in his career that he started applying this understanding to biology. He was appointed to the faculty at the University of California, Merced in 2009, where he established the Soil Physics Laboratory. Ghezzehei has applied his understanding of fluid flow to better conserve agriculture, including the NRI Projects in Five Points, California. He has been supported by the California Department of Water Resources to better understand the water retention, hydraulic conductivity and aggregate stability of the site. In particular, Ghezzehei looked to understand the impact of winter cover crops on soil water depletion and carbon capture. Ghezzehei works in California, a region well known for its dangerous wildfires. Whilst it had long been assumed that prescribed burns and low-severity wildfires were not dangerous to the soil below, Ghezzehei showed that they can weaken the soil structures. Soil comprises mineral particles bound by organic matter and other components to form aggregates. In severe fires, the organic materials burn, but the same is now true in low-severity fires. Ghezzehei has shown that fire increases the pressure within the aggregates due to the vaporisation of water; weakening the aggregates and overall soil structure. The damage was worse if the soil was more wet. He went on to study the stability of these soil aggregates, performing simulated burn experiments and monitoring the amount of organic carbon released to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide. His lab use various analytical techniques, including confocal laser microscopy. In 2019 Ghezzehei was made Chair fo the Life & Environmental Sciences Department at the University of California, Merced. He specialises in soil physics and environmental science. At UC Merced, Ghezzehei worked with Berhe to investigate the production of biochar and how it can be used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Ghezzehei and Berhe designed mobile biochar units, which convert biomass from agriculture and forestry to biochar.  Select publications    Personal life  Ghezzehei is married to Asmeret Asefaw Berhe, who he met in Eritrea. He has continued to take photographs of nature.

He earned his first degree from Aarhus University, and then studied natural sciences at the University of Copenhagen. This led to his working as an assistant to Professor Johan Erik Vesti Boas at the Agricultural University's zoological laboratory, as both a teacher and researcher. Following his marriage in 1919, he went to work at Birkerød State School in 1920, initially working as a part-time teacher, but 1921 as an assistant professor. This led to his writing several popular biology books. While teaching, he resumed his scientific studies, first at the Carlsberg Foundation's Biological Institute with Albert Fischer, and later at Stockholm University (1934-1936), where he earned his doctorate with the thesis, Entwicklungsphysiologische Studien über Spongilla lacustris (Studies of the developmental physiology of Spongilla lacustris). His interest in developmental physiology led to a series of lectures at Copenhagen University, and the possibility of a chair there, but war intervened. In 1941 he became principal of Birkerød State School, where he dealt with the difficult war years. In 1948, aged 55, he was appointed professor of general zoology at Copenhagen University. He introduced cytology and experimental embryology, and the courses included histology and evolutionary theory. This position led to the writing of textbooks which also became popular science texts. Alongside his teaching and research work, he became more and more preoccupied with philosophical and religious problems which needed to be related to the biological basis of life. This concern led further books relating religious concerns to biology.

Besides being known in the street art community, Apexer is considered an San Francisco artist celebrity and has done commissioned mural projects for commercial partners and museums including the deYoung Museum and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.  Biography  Apexer was born in San Francisco, California in 1978. He is a third generation San Franciscan. He is Latino and African-American. Apexer first noticed drawing when watching his mother doodling while she was on the phone. When he was in third grade, he remembers becoming interested in art. \\"I loved seeing the different colors everywhere around me and wanted to create my own.

History The pub dated from the Middle Ages, when it was a coaching inn. The origins of the name, \\"Saracen's Head\\", are uncertain. It became a popular stop for mail coaches approaching the City of London as it provided a place for passengers to rest. It featured a large gateway that led into a courtyard with numerous galleries leading into individual bedrooms.Walter Thornbury, 'St. Sepulchre's and its neighbourhood', in Old and New London: Volume 2 (London, 1878), pp. 477–491. British History Online http://www.british-history.ac.uk/old-new-london/vol2/pp477-491 [accessed 18 September 2020]. In 1522, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, stayed at the inn, by which time it had 30 beds and could stable four horses.Henry A Harben, 'Sandy's Row – Savage's Rents', in A Dictionary of London (London, 1918), British History Online [accessed 21 September 2020]. Samuel Pepys and Jonathan Swift were reported to be regular patrons at the inn. In the 18th century, the Mohocks kidnapped several elderly women at the inn, trapped them in barrels, and rolled them downhill towards Newgate Street. During the 19th century, there were three signs on each side of the pub with a picture of a Saracen. The pub was mentioned in Charles Dickens' Nicholas Nickleby, referencing two of the signs that adorned the courtyard gateway, and is where Nickleby first meets the schoolmaster Wackford Squeers. The Saracen's Head was demolished in 1868 to construct the Holborn Viaduct.; The landlord was subsequently arrested for attempting to sell spirits in an adjoining property following the inn's closure, as his licence had been revoked. There is a plaque noting the inn on the current premises. A song about the pub appears in the The Flying Inn.

Ahhatt gained global recognition in 2013 with her first U.S. hit single \\"If Only Tonight\\". Ahhatt's 2019 PBS concert show \\"A Music Extravaganza\\", which was recorded live at the National Opera of Ukraine, aired from June 2019 through early 2020.  Early life and education  Assia Ahhatt was born in Kyiv. Graduated from Glier College of Music and National Music Academy, both located in Kyiv, Ukraine. After graduation, she completed an internship at The Music Academy in Nice, France ().  Career  A violin prodigy since age five, Ahatt won numerous European competitions, and was among the Ukrainian National Philharmonic’s youngest soloists ever. Ahhatt’s first solo release Homo Novus came in 1999 and introduced her favorite classical-style instrumental music set to her own arrangements, followed by a tour of major U.S. cities. The single appeared on numerous U.S. charts, including Billboard’s Hot Single Chart (#6 in Billboard’s 2014 - Singles Chart). In 2002, Ahhatt turned her trained voice to singing and signed contracts with EMI records (Poland) and then Universal Poland, where she recorded the duet \\"Where Are You Now?\\" with Polish-born Hollywood actor Bogusław Linda — who also starred in the video. The song was an instant hit in Europe. That same year, Ahhatt signed a contract with Universal/Ukrainian Records, who released the album \\"Tebe, Anais\\" (For You, Anais). The album Chocolad (Chocolate) was released in 2003, showcasing Ahhatt's global appeal with songs performed in Russian, Polish and French. In her 2005 album \\"Душа болела\\" (Soul Hurts), Ahhatt included a vocal performance of Dreams in a self- created language that only she knows. In 2005, Ahhatt co-founded music group 69, expanding her role to producer and co-writer. The group's albums \\"Горячий поцелуй\\" (Hot Kiss) and \\"I Like It\\" were released in 2006. 2007 saw Ahhatt release another solo album, \\"Я лучшая\\" (I Am the Best), followed by 2010's \\"Ангелы не курят\\" (Angels Don't Smoke). In 2011, Ahhatt turned her creative focus to modern violin music and recorded her chart-topping U.S. debut single \\"If Only Tonight\\". The recording received recognition by DRT National Airplay in the Indie, R&B;, and Hip Hop categories, reaching #6 on Billboard's singles chart, as well as being featured on their National Dance Club Chart for several weeks. A remix by DJ Ralphi Rosario was a hit in dance clubs and discos across the U.S., and was on Billboard's National Dance Club Chart for several consecutive weeks. After the success of \\"If Only Tonight\\", Ahhatt turned her attention to Latin sounds, pairing up with Puerto Rican rapper Wisin to record Fiesta in San Juan, a dynamic, bilingual dance number with a towering violin solo. Both artists appear in the song's popular video, which was filmed in Old San Juan and produced and directed by the Jessy Terrero. Fiesta in San Juan made Billboard's Latin Tropical Chart, and the remix is nearing the Top 10 on Billboard's National Dance Club Chart. Ahhatt's evolution continued as she transformed into a pop performer who uses both her violin and her voice. The award-winning single Disco, produced by Dmytro Monatyk of Chilibisound, was released in 2016, and in April 2017 Assia debuted her single \\"Переплетает\\" to an audience in her home city of Kyiv. Her next single was 2017's \\"You Will Miss Me\\", recorded at Hit Factory Criteria in Miami and produced by Luny Tunes. The artist considers her 2018 album \\"All In\\" to be among the biggest achievements of her career, recorded on her own label Seize the Day Entertaining in partnership with multiple Grammy winner Humberto Gatica, who also produced the album and show of Ahhatt's PBS show A Music Extravaganza. All In's 13 international hits feature Assia's violin solos, backed by a full orchestra. Ahhatt has appeared with music icons including Robert Plant, Mark Knopfler, Jean-Luc Ponty, Pierre Blanchard, Kurt Elling, and Chris Botti, and worked with music composer Eric Serra. She records in Europe's top studios and the Westlake Studios in Los Angeles, Calif.  Videography  Assia's PBS concert show \\"A Music Extravaganza\\" was recorded live at the National Opera of Ukraine, directed by producer Gene Bortnick. The show was a huge hit in national airings (June 2019 to early 2020).

He painted in the style of the Hague School. Life Arnold (\\"Nol\\") Koning was born into a family of lawyers and administrators from Groningen. After completing the gymnasium in Winschoten, he left for Amsterdam to study at the Rijksacademie voor Beeldende Kunsten. In 1886 he made his debut by participating in an exhibition in Pictura (Groningen). The same year he moved to The Hague for courses at the Royal Academy of Art. In 1887 he left for Paris for nine months. There he met Theo van Gogh, art dealer for Goupil & Cie, and his older brother Vincent. After Vincent left Paris for the South in the spring of 1888, Arnold was given a place in Theo's apartment on Rue Lepic. Letters have been handed down from the friendship. Back in the Netherlands, Arnold went to live in The Hague again and traveled through the Netherlands to paint. With his brother Edzard Willem Koning, who was nine years younger, who also came to the Hofstad to study at the Hague academy, he was part of the Hague painting culture. Arnold married in 1893 and moved to Rijswijk. Two children were born from the marriage. In 1897 the family moved to Ede. A divorce followed in 1909. Shortly afterwards he had a house built on the outskirts of the nearby village of Voorthuizen, in which he would continue to work on an extensive oeuvre until an old age, in order to be in the middle of nature as much as possible. That oeuvre consists mainly of landscapes, although Koning has occasionally painted cityscapes and genre scenes. At first his style was closely related to the Hague School, but later became looser and more colorful. In addition to oil paintings, he also regularly made watercolors and pastels. He remarried and combined painting with a simple life as a small farmer. In the winter of 1944-45, Arnold fell down the cellar stairs at home and died. Koning was a member of Arti et Amicitiae, Pulchri Studio, the Haagse Kunstkring and Pictura Veluvensis. Painting style When Arnold Hendrik Koning started studying at the Rijksacademie in 1880, the Dutch impressionism of the Hague School was the leading style. Arnold mastered this style and remained true to it throughout his working life. Already in Paris, and later through the work of colleagues and in the artists' associations, he must have seen all the successive innovations around the turn of the century, but they ignored his style. Arnold painted the traditional Dutch landscape of fishermen and farmers. He used a loose, flowing style, in which the less important visual elements were suggested with a single brushstroke. This style was his reliable vehicle for capturing the atmosphere of the landscape. Arnold loved nature. The urbanization around The Hague drove Arnold to the unspoilt Veluwe. But the innovation caught up with him. The modernization of the Netherlands with the increase in scale in agriculture and the closure of the Zuiderzee transformed the landscape of farmers and fishermen. To Arnold, that change felt like destruction. From 1920 he retired to Voorthuizen. He had his garden and his animals. The chicken coop at the back of the garden dominated his small paintings. Only a limited number of landscapes in Koning's paintings can be located. Arnold did not consider it important to date and place his work. If titles are already known, a painting is called: On the edge of a town or Dorpsstraat in Overijssel. He was concerned with the atmosphere in the cultural landscape. Work in Dutch collections * The Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam owns several paintings by Arnold from Theo van Gogh's estate. After 1888 Arnold sent work to Theo to sell in Paris. They also have many letters in their archive referencing Koning, including letters to and from Theo as well as to and from Vincent van Gogh. * The Drents Museum in Assen manages the collection of the Fine Arts Foundation around 1900. Arnold Hendrik Koning is represented in this collection. * The Groninger Museum is a site. The museum has drawings and in 2003 an important work by Arnold Koning was acquired. * The municipalities of Barneveld and Ede also own Arnold Koning's work (mostly through donations). * Private collections - Arnold Koning may have been largely forgotten, but there are still a limited number of private collectors of his work. An exhibition was put together from these collections in 2008 in Harderwijk. At the same time there was an exhibition of work by Edzard Koning at the Veluws Museum Nairac in Barneveld. More information Arnold Koning was listed as one member of a rare antique group photograph of Vincent van Gogh and friends that was auctioned in 2015 but did not hit its reserve of $136,000. It appears to show the artist drinking with fellow post- Impressionists Paul Gauguin and Émile Bernard, among others, would be only the third confirmed photo of van Gogh to date.https://news.artnet.com/market/van- gogh-photo-at-auction-310193 The Dutch database of the National Office for Art History Documentation provides information about the painter Arnold Koning. (RKD about Arnold Koning) Elizabeth Yates (granddaughter of Edzard Koning) wrote a book about Arnold & Edzard Koning: Yates, Elizabeth. Royal art from Paris to the Veluwe. Royal BDU Publishers, 2008 (Book cover translation) \\"Impressionists Arnold (1860-1945) and Edzard Koning (1869-1954) are well- known and beloved artists. Edzard achieved fame as an illustrator of 'De kleine Johannes' and the 'Verkade Albums'. Arnold, partly influenced by his friendship and correspondence with Vincent van Gogh, left beautiful landscape paintings. Like all impressionists of the Hague School, they were genuine romantics who believed in an inspired nature. Their working life was characterized by a 'flight forwards', via Paris and The Hague, away from urbanization and industrialization and back to nature in the quiet Veluwe, near the estates along the IJssel, around Ede and Nunspeet, and finally in the Veluwse Voorthuizen to unwind. The area from the IJssel to the Zuiderzee was their great source of inspiration. They also wandered through the Netherlands, from Friesland to Zeeland, to visualize their impressions. Art historian Elizabeth Yates, granddaughter of Edzard Koning, places the life and work of the Koning brothers against the cultural background of the dynamic era around 1900.\\" Gallery  File:AHK - Winterlandschap met molen - olieverf op doek - 60 - 80 cm.JPG Winterlandschap met molen (ca.1886) File:AHK - Ede boerderij met op de achtergrond de Oude Kerk van Ede - olieverf 40,5-66 cm - Peerdeman 08.2015.JPGBoerderij met op de achtergrond de Oude Kerk van Ede (ca.1905) File:Afgemeerde botters - gemengde techniek 38 - 50 cm veiling Gerard ter Borg Groningen okt 2014.JPGAfgemeerde botters (ca.1910) File:AHK-Schepen in binnenhaven- aquarel 17,4-25,5 cm.JPGSchepen in binnenhaven File:AHK - Ede boerenhuisjes aan de Molenstraat - tekening - 20,5-28cm.jpgBoerenhuisjes Ede File:Kerk van Marsum kleurpotloodtekening 14-18,5cm.JPGKerk van Marsum File:Ets2.jpgBoer met koeien  References  Category:1860 births Category:1945 deaths Category:19th-century Dutch painters Category:20th- century Dutch painters Category:Dutch male painters Category:People from Winschoten ","title":"Arnold Hendrik Koning"},{"id":"65356157","text":"The 1977 Merdeka Tournament was held from 16 July to 31 July 1977 in Malaysia.

In their competition to determine who would reach the meeting place at Promontory, Utah first, starting in 1868, the railroad crews set and broke each other's world records for the longest length of track laid in a single day, culminating in the April 28, 1869 record set by Chinese and Irish crews of the Central Pacific, who laid of track in one day. That record was broken by approximately in August 1870 by two crews, working from both ends, during the construction of the Kansas Pacific. History =Rivalry= In July 1866, the Pacific Railway Act was amended, authorizing the Central Pacific (CP) to build east until it met the line being constructed by the Union Pacific (UP). The amount of land and money each railroad would be granted was proportional to the number of miles of track laid, causing the two railroads to start building in earnest. Their rivalry was notably unfriendly. In February 1869, crews for the UP and CP were grading parallel routes on the Promontory Range. At that time, the UP's primarily Irish crews began bullying the CP's primarily Chinese crews, first throwing clods of earth and escalating to a series of raids in which the UP crews attempted to dislodge the CP by attacking while wielding pick handles. Eventually, the UP crews began setting off heavy charges without warning, seriously injuring several CP workers; when the CP crews began grading at a higher elevation, they retaliated by setting off a surprise explosion, which buried several UP workers alive. =Tracklaying= Building the railroad started with surveying the route and grading the roadbed; for the CP, grading was delayed by the route chosen through the rugged Sierra mountain range. During the first five years of construction, the CP spent only 95 weeks laying tracks, while the remainder had been consumed in grading. In the CP's traditional approach to tracklaying, once the grading was complete, a loaded tracklaying car was sent to the end of the line, carrying a single crew and eight pairs of rails along with a commensurate number of ties, spikes, and splices. One pair of rails was unloaded at a time and the tracklaying car only advanced once the crew had completed that pair of rails. When the line curved, the rails were pre-bent (and the inside rail was shortened) prior to being loaded onto the tracklaying car. The slow pace of the tracklaying car and limited manpower that could be brought to bear meant that CP managed to complete only of track during the first five years of construction from 1863 to 1868, building east from Sacramento, despite adopting speedier techniques for curved rails and splices in 1866. Meanwhile, the UP had built from Omaha, Nebraska west to Cheyenne, Wyoming by 1868. In 1867, General Jack Casement of the UP described their current pace of laying of track per day as \\"a little slow at first, to get the new hands broke into their places\\" and confidently predicted they would double the rate to per day by the end of the summer. UP crews under Casement and his brother Daniel would lay of track in a single day in August 1867, prompting CP Vice President Collis P. Huntington to ask if they should send a spy to watch the UP at work. 10-mile sign replica at Golden Spike National Historical Park Visitor's Center In March 1868, a former UP tracklayer joined the CP, happy to share the UP's technique to speed up tracklaying. Rather than have a single crew take on all aspects of tracklaying work, the crews of the Casement brothers were organized more like an assembly line: crews were specialized, employing more men in total, but having each man be responsible for a limited set of tasks such as rail handling, spiking, splicing, etc. In addition, the tracklaying car was advanced over the loose rails, before they were completely spiked in place, allowing work to take place simultaneously along a longer distance of track. One contemporary newspaper account described the UP process in military terms, with workers divided into armies of suppliers, graders, tie setters, and track-layers. Tracklaying in this fashion was limited mainly by supplies and supply lines, typically to per day. The rapid pace of the work was thought to be affecting its quality, but the tracks laid in this manner had no issues in passing mandatory government inspections, which were required to release funds to the UP. =Record-setting pace= On August 17, 1868, UP crews laid of track in a single day; their bragging aroused a competitive instinct in Charles Crocker, head of the CP, who instructed his construction superintendent James Harvey Strobridge to beat it. CP crews responded by laying a few feet beyond on August 19, and UP's riposte was to lay of track in a single day on October 26, working from 3 AM until midnight. The disparity in pace continued into 1869; on February 18, Oliver Ames Jr., president of UP, testified before the Congressional Pacific Railroad Committee, pointing out that while the CP was from the prearranged meeting spot in Ogden, Utah, the UP was only away, and should be entitled to continue building west past Ogden. CP's Huntington, also testifying that day, retorted UP's pace was purchased at the cost of quality. On March 12, 1869 Mark Hopkins sent the coded message \\"Roving Delia Fish Dance\\" to Huntington, letting him know his crews were laying of track per day regularly. This proved the production gains of adopting Casement's techniques and set the stage for the Ten Mile Day of April 28, 1869. =Ten Miles of Track, Laid in One Day= Replica sign in the California State Railroad Museum, Sacramento As the two railroad companies approached the meeting point at Promontory Summit, the UP's advance slowed significantly as some of the heaviest work was ahead; at one point, the UP graders were just ahead of the tracklaying crews. Thomas C. Durant, the vice-president of the UP, reportedly had a bet with Crocker for $10,000; the winner would be determined by whose crews could lay the most track in a single day, but there is no contemporary evidence to prove the bet existed. California Governor Leland Stanford had a much smaller wager of $500 with the chief track-layer, Mr. Horace Minkler, which Stanford was happy to pay. The CP's first attempt at a tracklaying record was abandoned on April 27, after a locomotive derailed. The CP had laid of rails that day. At that point, the CP was just short of completing their section of the line, while the UP was from Promontory, ensuring that should the CP set the record, the UP would be unable to break it without taking up completed track. The next day, work began at daybreak. One railcar, fully loaded with 8 pairs of rails, spikes, and other supplies, was pulled up to the end of the track by teams of horses; when it met an empty car returning to the supply base, the empty car was tipped on its side to allow the loaded car to pass. As the loaded car reached the end of the line, one pair of rails was pulled down and laid over the ties by a team of four rail handlers, then the car was advanced over the loose rails while another team of spikers started spikes to secure the rails. Additional teams finished the spiking and buried the ends of the ties. Strobridge and Minkler at Camp Victory, April 28, 1869. Photographed by Alfred A. Hart. A correspondent for the Daily Alta California timed the pace for two carloads; the cars, each containing of track, were emptied in 80, then 75 seconds. By lunch, were complete, approximately 6 hours after work began. The crews took an hour-long break to eat before resuming work, saucily naming the site Camp Victory. After lunch, an hour was spent bending rails for the upcoming route, a curving ascent. The eight-man rail- laying team refused to be relieved after lunch and continued their work hauling rails off the work cars. When work ceased at 7 PM that night, the CP crews had laid of track in a single day, setting the record. To prove the track was sound, a locomotive was run over the newly-laid track, completing the route in 40 minutes. CP crews completed the remainder of their part of the line to Promontory Summit the next day. In total, 25,800 ties, 3,520 rails (averaging each), 55,000 spikes, and 14,080 bolts were used that day, consuming of material. A delegation from the Union Pacific had been invited to witness the record attempts. When the first attempt failed on April 27, the UP delegates privately expressed skepticism that their record could be broken; by the end of the Ten-Mile Day, one delegate admitted \\"the organization of the Central Pacific is far superior to [ours].\\" The names of the eight Irish rail- layers, who were responsible for hauling the rails off the loaded cars, and the two men who gauged the track were recorded in foreman George Coley's log book. The contribution of numerous Chinese workers was undeniable, although the roles they played were not well-described. The relationship between the Chinese and Irish crews of the CP was described as amicable. Legacy Some of the UP crews who were denied a chance to break the CP record later worked on the Kansas Pacific, who set a new record with laid in a single day at Comanche Crossing near Strasburg, Colorado on August 15, 1870, completing the first continuous transcontinental railroad. Despite the new record that was set in 1870, the Southern Pacific (successor to the CP) continued to claim the record into the early 20th century. Map of the Promontory Branch and Lucin Cutoff, drawn by Aran Raymond (1981). Rozel (Camp Victory) and Promontory Summit are labeled on the map. The ten-mile rail segment laid in 1869 (and the Promontory Golden Spike site) was bypassed in 1903 with the completion of the Lucin Cutoff, although service continued for several years on the original route, which the Southern Pacific called its Promontory Branch. The abandoned rails were eventually taken up for scrap and reuse in 1942. At the Golden Spike National Historical Park, the West Auto Tour is a route that takes tourists to a replica of the sign erected by the CP at the site to commemorate the April 28 record. The original sign is thought to be in the Utah State Capitol building in Salt Lake City; a replacement sign that may have stood at the site is on display at the visitor's center in Promontory, and a replica is displayed at the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento. =In art= April 28, 1869 is a prominent day in author Frank Chin's 1991 novel Donald Duk; the eponymous protagonist dreams of the events of that day and awakens, outraged to find that history has recorded only the names of the eight Irish tracklayers who worked that day.

The couple was married in three ceremonies, one according to the rites of the Roman Catholic Church, the groom's faith, at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Dionysius the Areopagite, one according to the rites of the Greek Orthodox Church, the bride's faith, at the Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens and a third civil ceremony was held upon their return to the Royal Palace. Don Juan Carlos was the eldest son of Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona, pretender to the Spanish throne, and Princess María de las Mercedes of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, while Princess Sophia was the eldest daughter of King Paul of the Hellenes and Princess Friederike of Hanover. Juan Carlos and Sophia, who know goes by Sofía (the Spanish spelling of her name), reigned as King and Queen of Spain from 1975 until his abdication in 2014. Engagement Juan Carlos, who then held the title of Prince of Asturias in pretense,, n° XII. and Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark, third cousins through Queen Victoria, first met in 1954 on a cruise in the Greek Islands on board the liner SS Agamemnon. The cruise was organized by Queen Frederica with the intent of promoting Greek tourism and encourage matches among the younger generation of European royalty. The couple reconnected at the wedding of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, and Katharine Worsley in June 1961. They became engaged three months after the Kent's wedding. The engagement was announced on 13 September 1961 at the home of Juan Carlos's paternal grandmother, Queen Victoria Eugenie, in Lausanne. Juan Carlos gave Sophia a ring made from melted down ancient Greek coins. When he presented her with the ring, he tossed the box at her and said \\"Sofi, catch it!\\" =Controversy= The uncertain position of Juan Carlos as a prince from a deposed dynasty made him a controversial choice as a future husband for a reigning princess. Spanish monarchists rejoiced at the betrothal as they believed it made the prospected of restoration following Franco's demise more realistic. From the outset, the difference in religion caused friction on both sides. A compromise was eventually reached where two ceremonies would be held and Sophia would convert to Catholicism and use the Spanish variant of her name, Sofía. Pope John XXIII allowed two ceremonies as the Greek Orthodox Church was the state religion. Spanish media was requested by Franco not to cover the Greek Orthodox ceremony. The prospect of a state-funded dowry for Princess Sophia caused controversy in Greece. The Hellenic Parliament approved a $300,000 tax-free dowry for the princess. The Centre Union and United Democratic Left parties abstained from voting but voiced their criticism and \\"denounced the practice of granting dowries as anachronistic and barbarous.\\" Pre-wedding celebrations On 12 May 1962, a white-tie gala was held at the Royal Palace to celebrate the impending wedding. An addition to the palace was built to house a new ballroom for the wedding celebrations. It is the largest room in the now Presidential Mansion, called the Reception Hall.Kardamitsi- Adami, Maro (2009). Palaces in Greece. Melissa Books. .

Prince and Princess of Asturias with US President John F. Kennedy, 4 September 1962. As of 2020, Juan Carlos and Sofía have been married for 58 years. They have three children, Elena (born 1963), Cristina (born 1965) and Felipe (born 1968), current King of Spain. In 1975, the pair acceded to the Spanish throne following the death of Francisco Franco. They reigned for nearly 39 years until his abdication in 2014. They have lived separately since August 2020 when Juan Carlos left Spain in exile amid corruption accusations. =Honeymoon= The couple travelled extensively on their honeymoon. They initially set out on a yacht cruise around the Greek islands. Further destinations included Spain, Monaco, Italy, India, Thailand, the United States and Japan. In Italy, they had an audience with Pope John XXIII. In the United States, they met with President John F. Kennedy. While the couple were away, Franco and the Count of Barcelona were in talks about the future of the Spanish monarchy and neither party could agree on where the young couple should live. Eventually, they returned to Spain where they settled in the Palace of Zarzuela. They would live at Zarzuela for the next 58 years until Juan Carlos left Spain in exile. It is unclear whether Queen Sofía will remain living there or not. =Reaction in Spain= In the Spanish State, Franco allowed three major newspapers to cover the wedding. Pictures of the wedding were shown on state television. However, no photographs of the groom's father, the Count of Barcelona, who was on bad terms with Franco, were allowed to be published. Spanish monarchists rejoiced at the marriage. Franco bestowed the Order of Charles III on both Juan Carlos and Sofía.https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/1962/06/01/pdfs/A07498-07498.pdf =Subsequent royal marriages= As this wedding brought together many young, unmarried nobles, many more royal weddings came about as a result. Among the couples who met or became better acquainted at the wedding who later married: * Prince Carlos Hugo of Bourbon-Parma and Princess Irene of the Netherlands, married on 29 April 1964, divorced in 1981. * Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta, and Princess Claude of Orléans, married on 22 July 1964, divorced in 1982. * Crown Prince Constantine of Greece and Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark, married on 18 September 1964. * Prince Carlos, Duke of Noto, and Princess Anne of Orléans, married on 12 May 1965.

Completed and commissioned in August 1944, she served in World War II and conducted transport missions between Japan and outlying islands until she was converted into a kaiten suicide attack torpedo carrier. She survived the war, surrendered to Allied forces in 1945, and was scuttled in 1946. Construction and commissioning I-366 was laid down on 26 August 1943 by Mitsubishi at Kobe, Japan, with the name Submarine No. 5466. She was launched on 9 March 1944 and was renamed I-366 that day. She was completed and commissioned on 3 August 1944. Service history Upon commissioning, I-366 was attached to the Yokosuka Naval District and was assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 for workups in the Kobe area. She later moved to Kure where one of her diesel engines broke down in early September 1944. Repairs took until early October 1944. With her workups complete, she was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 7 on 2 October 1944, and she arrived at Yokosuka in early November 1944. =Transport missions= At 16:00 on 3 December 1944, I-366 departed Yokosuka bound for Pagan in the Mariana Islands on her first transport mission, carrying 51 metric tons of food and ammunition. Shortly after her departure, she encountered a storm, and lost several supply containers filled with rice on her afterdeck that were washed overboard. On 10 December 1944, she was on the surface recharging her batteries when she detected an aircraft and crash- dived, intending to dive to , but a valve malfunctioned, causing her to descend to and develop a leak through her periscope shaft. She arrived at Pagan on the evening of 14 December 1944, transferred her cargo to Daihatsu- class landing craft, embarked 49 passengers, including some military pilots, and got back underway after only four hours. At least 10 of her passengers were wounded personnel, and six of them died during the voyage to Japan. She arrived at Yokosuka at 10:00 on 28 December 1944 and disembarked her 43 surviving passengers. After arriving at Yokosuka, I-366 began a refit, during which a Type 13 air-search radar was installed. As of 1 January 1945, she was part of Submarine Squadron 7 along with the submarines , , , , , , , and . With her overhaul complete, I-366 departed Yokosuka on 29 January 1945 for her second transport voyage, bound for Truk with a cargo of aviation gasoline and spare parts for the Nakajima C6N1 Saiun (\\"Iridiscent Cloud\\"; Allied reporting name \\"Myrt\\") reconnaissance aircraft of the 141st Naval Air Group, which needed the fuel and parts for reconnaissance flights over the United States Navy anchorage at Ulithi Atoll. Soon after departure, her crew discovered that her shortwave radio mast would not retract, so she returned to Yokosuka. With the mast repaired, she again put to sea that evening, spent the night of 29–30 January 1945 in the Tateyama Bight, and then set out into the Pacific Ocean. During her voyage, one of her lookouts reported sighting an Allied cruiser on southwesterly headed at 04:48 on 10 February 1945. On 12 February 1945, I-366 arrived at Truk, where she unloaded 33 tons of fuel and some other cargo. She then headed for Mereyon Island at Woleai in the Caroline Islands, which she reached on 16 February 1945. She unloaded 51 tons of food and ammunition into nine Daihatsus, embarked 42 or 43 passengers (sources disagree), and got back underway, bound for Yokosuka. During her voyage, she sighted an Iwo Jima-bound Allied convoy in late February 1945. She arrived at Yokosuka on 3 March 1945. =Kaiten carrier= Submarine Squadron 7 was deactivated on 20 March 1945 and I-366 was reassigned to Submarine Division 15. Meanwhile, after reaching Yokosuka, I-366 was converted from a transport submarine into a kaiten suicide attack torpedo carrier, the conversion involving the removal of her deck gun and Daihatsu-class landing craft and their replacement with fittings allowing her to carry five kaitens on her deck. Unlike some of the other Type D1 submarines, she was not equipped with conventional torpedo tubes. While I-366 was undergoing conversion, U.S. forces captured advanced bases and anchorages in the Kerama Islands southwest of Okinawa between 26 and 29 March 1945, and the Battle of Okinawa began when U.S. forces landed on Okinawa itself on 1 April 1945. With her conversion complete, I-366 and the submarine I-367 were designated the Shimbu (\\"God's Warriors\\") Kaiten Group, and on 2 May 1945 I-366 received orders to get underway on 4 May 1945 for the kaiten base at Hikari, where she was to load kaitens, and then deploy to the waters between Okinawa and Ulithi Atoll to attack Allied ships. While conducting kaiten launch exercises off Hikari on 6 May 1945, however, she detonated a magnetic mine at around 12:00, and the explosion damaged her propellers and stern planes. A tug from Hikari arrived and took her under tow. The damage prevented her from taking part in the Shimbu mission. I-366 underwent repairs at Kure Navy Yard in Kure. While she was under repair, a new radar was installed aboard her. By 20 July 1945, her repairs were complete and she was engaged in kaiten training. By 1 August 1945, I-366 was part of the Tamon Kaiten Group along with the submarines , , , , and . With five kaitens on board, she got underway from Hirao that day bound for a patrol area southeast of Okinawa. On 11 August 1945, I-366 sighted an Allied convoy north of Palau and attempted to launch all five of her kaitens. Two were defective, but she launched the other three at very long range. I-366 did not detect any hits, and her navigator opined that all three kaitens had run out of fuel before reaching the convoy and their pilots had suffocated. I-366 nonetheless claimed three Allied transports sunk in the attack, although postwar analysis assessed no damage to the convoy's ships. I-366 set course for Japan. While she was en route, she received word on 15 August 1945 that Emperor Hirohito had announced the end of hostilities between Japan and the Allies that day. She arrived at Kure on 18 August 1945 and surrendered to the Allies in September 1945. Final disposition In October 1945, I-366 moved from Kure to Sasebo, where she was stripped of all valuable materials and equipment. The Japanese struck her from the Navy list on 30 November 1945. In Operation Road's End, the U.S. Navy submarine tender towed I-366 from Sasebo to an area off the Goto Islands on 1 April 1946, where she was among a number of Japanese submarines scuttled that day. Her Japanese crew was taken off by 13:39. At 13:50, a demolition charge in her stern compartment exploded and she began to sink slowly by the stern, her bow rising out of the water. At 13:52, a demolition charge in her bow detonated and I-366 blew up. Debris from I-366 landed over a wide area, and one of her torpedo tube doors missed Nereus′s motor launch, which was carrying some of I-366′s crew members, by only about .

He competed at the World Amateur Snooker Championship several times, and was a professional snooker player from 1981 to 1993. Early life Demarco was born on 9 June 1924 in Leith, the son of Umberto Luigi Demarco who owned a café in Edinburgh, and in 1939 established the Jubilee billiard hall next to it. Luigi, known as Bert from a young age, said that he learnt to play snooker aged 12, whilst on holiday with relatives that had a snooker table. He was introduced to the game by two female cousins and stood on a lemonade crate in order to reach the table. His father enforced a rule that no persons under 18, including his son, could play in the Jubilee hall, although the younger Demarco was allowed to use the billiard tables there on Sundays when the café was closed. Demarco attended the Holy Cross Academy in Leith. During World War II he joined the Royal Air Force as a volunteer from 1942, and served until 1946, in roles including mechanic and translator, travelling to Africa, Italy, and Palestine. In 1947 he married Maria Paoli, and the couple had three sons. Snooker career He won the Scottish amateur snooker championship in 1955, 1965 and 1966; and the Scottish billiards title in 1972. His 1965 snooker victory led to an invitation to participate in the 1966 World Amateur Snooker Championship in Karachi, where he finished fifth out of six players. At the 1970 World Amateur Snooker Championship he was sixth of seven players in his group, and in 1972 he was last in his group of four. In 1976 he fared slightly better, fifth of eight in the group. He also took part in the world amateur billiards championship in 1973, but failed to win any of his nine matches. From the mid-1970s he opened a chain of snooker clubs, and also coached a number of players including Stephen Hendry. Amongst the clubs he owned was Marco's Leisure Centre, which with 65 tables, was the largest snooker hall in Europe. He played professionally from 1981 to 1993, but never reached as far as the last 32 of a ranking tournament. Demarco died on 17 March 2012 following a stroke.

Overview The Negoyadai Site is located in the Kamikake neighborhood of Utsunomiya, on the right fluvial terrace of the Sugatagawa River, and was discovered during the construction of the modern Utsunomiya Municipal Cemetery. Per excavations carried out from 1982 to 1988, and the remains of pit dwellings, square pillar buildings, and more than 339 grave pits were discovered. The grave pits were grouped in clusters of five to ten pits per group, and are arranged so as to surround a central plaza. Each grave is around one meter in diameter, with a depth of 50-60 centimetres. Several of the pit dwellings were unusually large, over eight meters long and with several hearths, indicating that more than one family unit resided in the same building. Likewise, some of the rectangular raised-floor buildings were unusually large, with a length of 14 to 24 meters. As the size of the necropolis is far larger than the number of buildings would normally indicate, it is assumed that this was more of a ritual site rather than a settlement location. The grave goods excavated from the grave pits included stone earrings, cylindrical beads, and stone implements. These artifacts were collectively designated as an Important Cultural Property of Japan in 1990. As a result of the National Historic Site designation, the city of Utsunomiya City has reduced the size of the cemetery and has maintained the area around the ruins as park with four reconstructions of pit dwellings. It is located about 30 minutes by car from Utsunomiya Station on the Tōhoku Shinkansen.

Elwes began teasing the event in his Twitter feed in early September, 2020, announcing it openly on September 4: > #Inconceivable! I’m excited to announce a virtual #PrincessBrideReunion! > Chip in any amount at the link & get an invite to this special event on Sun. > Sept. 13th with myself, @RealRobinWright, @PatinkinMandy, @robreiner & many > more! #DumpTrumperdinck. Wisconsin is considered an important \\"swing state\\" in the 2020 Presidential Election. In 2016, Donald Trump won the state, despite consistent polls that showed Hillary Clinton ahead.\\"Wisconsin: Trump vs. Clinton\\" (Real Clear Politics, 2016) The police shooting of Jacob Blake in August 2020, followed by the fatal shooting of several protestors, have also created political tension in Wisconsin. Senator Ted Cruz, responding to the event announcement on Twitter, said that he wished the Princess Bride movie, which he called \\"perfect,\\" would stay out of \\"Hollywood politics.\\" Widespread news coverage of Cruz's criticism, and of pushback from the cast, \\"led to a surge of publicity,\\" according to The New Yorker. Cast Although most of the original actors volunteered for the fundraiser, Deadline Hollywood announced on September 9 that there would be several replacements and additions. The replacements included Whoopi Goldberg (playing more than one part), Eric Idle (playing The Impressive Clergyman), and Josh Gad (playing Fezzik.) Two roles originated by Peter Falk (Grandpa and The Narrator) were taken by Rob Reiner and Jason Reitman. Norman Lear joined the Q&A; session at the end, which was hosted by Patton Oswalt. Fred Savage was unable to join the event because it conflicted with his brother's birthday. =Framing story= * Jason Reitman as The Narrator (played by Peter Falk in the movie) * Rob Reiner as Grandpa (played by Peter Falk in the movie) * Finn Wolfhard as The Grandson (played by Fred Savage in the movie) * Whoopi Goldberg as The Mother (played by Betsy Brantley in the movie) =Main story= * Cary Elwes as Westley/Dread Pirate Roberts/The Man in Black * Robin Wright as Buttercup/The Princess Bride * Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya * Chris Sarandon as Prince Humperdinck * Christopher Guest as Count Tyrone Rugen * Wallace Shawn as Vizzini * Josh Gad as Fezzik (played by André the Giant in the movie) * Billy Crystal as Miracle Max * Carol Kane as Valerie, Max's wife * Eric Idle as The Impressive Clergyman (played by Peter Cook in the movie) * Shaun Ross as The Man With Albinism (played by Mel Smith in the movie) * Whoopi Goldberg as The Ancient Booer (played by Margery Mason in the movie) * King Bach as Yellin, a soldier of Florin (played by Malcolm Storry in the movie) =Additions to the original= * Patton Oswalt served as MC and hosted the Q&A; session afterward. * Ben Wikler spoke on behalf of Wisconsin Democrats. Performance After some technical problems that delayed the performance, Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairman Ben Wikler thanked the audience for supporting Democrats. Although 2020 polling shows Joe Biden ahead of Donald Trump in Wisconsin, Wikler noted that Trump won Wisconsin in 2016 despite trailing in polls throughout that campaign. To set the scene, Jason Reitman read the screenplay's stage directions in addition to reading the role of The Narrator. A few performers had transient audio problems, and King Bach did not appear due to technical problems. Finn Wolfhard read Bach's parts, as well as The Grandson. The actors were filmed individually in their homes, as is common in 2020 due to Coronavirus. Most wore ordinary street clothing and read without props, although Mandy Patinkin and Billy Crystal used some of their props from the film. After the readthrough, Patton Oswalt moderated a Q&A; session with questions from the online audience. Norman Lear, the film's producer, said there were no plans to remake the movie but that he hoped to see a musical version some day. Reception and aftermath Despite some technical glitches, the table-reading received positive reviews. The AV Club mentioned \\"the obvious love and enthusiasm with which every member of the cast, original or otherwise, brought to this event,\\" but singled out Mandy Patinkin for special praise. Listing \\"11 delights\\" from the event, they mentioned Josh Gad's \\"surprisingly moving Andre the Giant tribute,\\" Billy Crystal's homemade \\"Miracle Max\\" set, and \\"basically everything involving Mandy Patinkin.\\" According to Rolling Stone, \\"highlights included Elwes donning a medical mask for the line 'It’s just that masks are terribly comfortable — I think everyone will be wearing them in the future' and Patinkin’s entire performance.\\" The New Yorker also singled out Patinkin, and his dramatic introduction of Inigo Montoya's six-fingered sword: > ...he threw himself into his old role with a passion that seemed to sear the > lens of his Webcam. He roared, he wept, he danced; he rolled his 'R's and > sharpened his 'E's; he even came in costume—a white shirt, rakishly > unbuttoned to mid-chest. At the moment of the story’s first marvelous duel, > when Montoya introduces his sword, Patinkin presented—-to considerable > excitement in my household (and on Twitter, where my feed was briefly > overwhelmed by exclamation marks and the word “sword”)—-an actual prop sword > from the film itself. Entertainment Weekly noted many viewer comments on the \\"Miracle Max\\" background Billy Crystal had created (he also wore his original hat from the film.) They also enjoyed the Q&A; session, including the cast's memories of Andre the Giant More than 110,000 listeners donated $1 or more to be able to tune in to the event, which raised $4.25 million for Wisconsin Democrats. On September 18, the Associated Press updated earlier numbers to say that more than 142,000 viewers made donations, bringing the amount raised to $4.26 million. Trump campaign spokespeople, however, said that the online event would not help Biden win Wisconsin. Elwes, being interviewed on Morning Joe on September 17, said that other battleground states had approached him about doing table reads of other classic movies. A recording of the live performance can be accessed using a passcode, in exchange for a donation to Wisconsin Democrats.

One of its main activities is operating the annual New York State Fair. Activities A major activity of the society is running the annual New York State Fair. The first such fair was held in 1841, in Syracuse, and drew 10,000 attendees over two days. The second was held in Albany, with Auburn, Buffalo, Elmira, New York City, Poughkeepsie, Rochester, Saratoga Springs, Watertown and Utica all hosting fairs between 1842 and 1889. The fair moved permanently back to Syracuse in 1890. The society publishes a newspaper titled The Cultivator. Originally a monthly publication, it is semi-annual. The society supports research into ways to make farms more productive, such as the best type of grass to grow for feeding dairy cows, and whether grass fields should grow naturally or be plowed and reseeded periodically. The society honors New York State agricultural businesses with a Business of the Year award. Every year since 1937, the society has also given the Century Farm Award in four out of 56 counties on a rotating basis. These awards were given to farms that had been owned and operated by one family for one hundred years, where the families were also \\"good farmers and active members of the community in which they live\\". The society holds an annual dinner, traditionally attended by the governor of New York State. It has also hosted dignitaries such as US Department of Agriculture secretary Arthur Hyde, newspaper publisher Frank Gannett, and University of Maryland president Raymond Pearson. In 1876, the society had an income of $41,210. Of that, $15,086 was from the state fair. In 1900, as a result of a change to a state law, the New York State Agricultural Society was mandated to receive $20,000 in premiums \\"of all moneys appropriated for the promotion of agriculture in any one year\\". The society runs the New York State Agricultural Society Foundation, which makes grants to young scholars to promote agricultural literacy, professional skills, and provide funding for students to attend the society's annual functions.

Completed and commissioned in August 1944, she served in World War II and conducted transport missions between Japan and outlying islands until she was converted into a kaiten suicide attack torpedo carrier. She survived the war, surrendered to Allied forces in 1945, and was scuttled in 1946. Construction and commissioning I-367 was laid down on 22 October 1943 by Mitsubishi at Kobe, Japan, with the name Submarine No. 5467. She was renamed I-367 prior to completion. She was launched on 28 April 1944 and was completed and commissioned on 15 August 1944.Children's Day (Japan) Service history Upon commissioning, I-367 was attached to the Sasebo Naval District and was assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 for workups. With her workups complete, she was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 7 on 15 October 1944, joining the submarines , , , , , , , and . =Transport missions= On 31 October 1944, I-367 departed Yokosuka bound for Marcus Island on her first transport mission, carrying 61 metric tons of food and ammunition. She arrived at Marcus Island on 6 November 1944 and returned to Yokosuka, which she reached on 12 November 1944. She departed Yokosuka on 4 December 1944 for her second transport voyage, heading for Wake Island with a cargo of 81 tons of food ammunition. She reached Wake on 17 December 1944, unloaded her cargo, got back underway, and returned to Yokosuka on 1 January 1945. =Kaiten carrier= Submarine Squadron 7 was deactivated on 20 March 1945 and I-367 was reassigned to Submarine Division 15. Meanwhile, after reaching Yokosuka she was converted at Yokosuka Navy Yard from a transport submarine into a kaiten suicide attack torpedo carrier, the conversion involving the removal of her deck gun and Daihatsu-class landing craft and their replacement with fittings allowing her to carry five kaitens on her deck. Her conversion was completed in late April 1945. First kaiten mission While I-367 was undergoing conversion, U.S. forces captured advanced bases and anchorages in the Kerama Islands southwest of Okinawa between 26 and 29 March 1945, and the Battle of Okinawa began when U.S. forces landed on Okinawa itself on 1 April 1945. I-366 and I-367 were designated the Shimbu (\\"God's Warriors\\") Kaiten Group, and on 1 May 1945 I-367 moved to the kaiten base at Otsujima to load kaitens so she could deploy to attack Allied ships supporting the fighting on Okinawa. Off Otsujima, she conducted kaiten exercises on 2 and 3 May and a test dive with kaitens aboard on 4 May 1945. On 5 May 1945 — Boys' Day in Japan — she got underway for a patrol area northwest of Saipan flying the traditional Boy's Day koinobori (carp streamer) from the radio antenna on her conning tower. I-366 suffered damage when she struck a magnetic mine off Hikari on 6 May 1945 and could not deploy, so I-367 became the only submarine to patrol as part of the Shimbu Group. Between 15 and 19 May 1945 — during which she arrived in her patrol area southeast of Okidaitojima and northwest of Saipan on 17 May 1945 — I-367 made sound contact on Allied vessels four times, but each time was unable to close for an attack. She was east of Okinawa on 27 May 1945 when she sighted a four-ship convoy made up of vessels of United States Navy Service Squadron 6. Three of I-367′s kaitens were defective — two with malfunctioning rudders and one with engine trouble — but from a position on the convoy's port beam, she launched her other two kaitens. The fleet tug sank one of the kaitens with fire from a Bofors 40 mm gun. I-367 claimed two merchant ships sunk and some reports claimed that the destroyer escort suffered damage in a kaiten attack on 27 May, but in fact the convoy suffered no damage from I-367′s attack and Gilligan′s damage was inflicted by a kamikaze. I-367 set course for Japan, arriving at Otsujima on 4 June 1945 to disembark her remaining kaitens and kaiten pilots. She then proceeded to Kure, arriving there on 5 June 1945. Second kaiten mission On 19 July 1945, I-367 was part of the Tamon Kaiten Group along with the submarines , , , I-363, and I-366. With five kaitens on board, she got underway from the kaiten base at Otsujima that day bound for a patrol area southeast of Okinawa. She made no contacts during her patrol. She was off the Bungo Strait on her return voyage to Japan when she received word on 15 August 1945 that Emperor Hirohito had announced the end of hostilities between Japan and the Allies that day. She arrived at Otsujima later that day and disembarked her kaiten pilots, then headed for Kure, which she reached on 16 August 1945. She surrendered to the Allies in September 1945. Final disposition I-367 moved from Kure to Sasebo, where she was stripped of all valuable materials and equipment. The Japanese struck her from the Navy list on 30 November 1945. In Operation Road's End, the U.S. Navy submarine tender towed I-367 from Sasebo to an area off the Goto Islands on 1 April 1946. Her Japanese crew was taken off by 13:10. At 13:18, demolition charges aboard her exploded and she sank in 30 seconds, the second of a number of Japanese submarines scuttled in the area that day.

The style consolidated the approach of Brazilian samba with American jazz, especially bebop and hard bop, jazzy styles quite experienced by Brazilian musicians in scope of gafieiras and nightclubs especially in Rio de Janeiro. Having its initial formation based on the piano, the double bass and the drums, samba-jazz gradually absorbed broader musical instruments. Unlike bossa nova, which is a style of samba characterized by its intimate spirit, soft sound and the restraint of sound elements, samba-jazz has many elements present in improvisation and stridency. Nevertheless as bossa nova became well known, samba-jazz itself was favored by the bossa-novista repertoire, and a whole generation of instrumentalists influenced by American jazz, such as Sérgio Mendes, J.T. Meirelles, Edison Machado, Dom Um Romão, Zimbo Trio, Tamba Trio, Milton Banana Trio, Jongo Trio, among others, became involved with the style led by João Gilberto.

Mount Ellsworth is part of the Henry Mountains. It is situated in a dry, rugged, and sparsely settled region west of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, on primitive land administered by the Bureau of Land Management. Precipitation runoff from this mountain drains into tributaries of the nearby Colorado River, which here is Lake Powell eight miles to the east of this mountain. History The American geologist Grove Karl Gilbert surveyed this area in 1875 and 1876, and published his findings in 1879 as a monograph, The Geology of the Henry Mountains. The term laccolith was first applied as laccolite by Gilbert after his study of intrusions of diorite in the Henry Mountains. Mount Ellsworth's name appeared on an 1875 map, but the origin is a mystery.Pete Klocki and Tiffany Mapel, A Wild Redhead Tamed: A Brief History of the Colorado River and Lake Powell, 2009, page 85. Gilbert did name nearby Mount Holmes, four miles to the northeast. Climate Spring and fall are the most favorable seasons to visit Mount Ellsworth. According to the Köppen climate classification system, it is located in a Cold semi-arid climate zone, which is defined by the coldest month having an average mean temperature below 32 °F (0 °C), and at least 50% of the total annual precipitation being received during the spring and summer. This desert climate receives less than of annual rainfall, and snowfall is generally light during the winter.

The jail is one of the most overcrowded in the world.  History  Old Bilibid Prison c. 1900 = 19th and 20th centuries = The Old Bilibid Prison, then known as (Spanish, \\"Correctional Jail and Military Prison\\") occupied a rectangular piece of land that was part of the Mayhalique Estate in the heart of Manila. The old prison was established by the Spanish colonial government on 25 June 1865 via royal decree. It was divided into two sections: the (jail), which could accommodate 600 inmates; and the (prison), which could hold 527 prisoners. The Commonwealth of the Philippines enacted Commonwealth Act No. 67 on 23 October 1936, which allocated 1million Philippine pesos to build a new prison in Muntinlupa on 551 hectares (1,360 acres) of land in an area that was considered at that time to be remote. Construction began the same year. In 1940, the prisoners, equipment and facilities were transferred from Old Bilibid to the new prison, which was officially named the New Bilibid Prison. The remnants of the old facility became the Manila City Jail. = Present day = The Manila City Jail began overcrowding at the start of the Rodrigo Duterte administration, during the crack down on drug-related crimes. In September 2019, two inmates were killed and 32 were injured in a riot that began with an argument between two members of rival gangs over a sleeping space. At the time, the dormitory in the facility where the fight broke out was housing 800 inmates despite having a 200-person capacity. As the COVID-19 pandemic began to spread in 2020, a spokesperson for the Manila City Jail told ABS-CBN News that the jail was housing more than four times its intended capacity, with 4,800 inmates in the facility. The jail began to allow inmates to stay in open spaces within the jail compound to increase physical distancing. Family visits were disallowed, and the jail added ten computers to allow for visits via video chat (). Jail employees were put under lockdown and not allowed to return home beginning 20 March 2020. An old building previously used to quarantine tuberculosis patients was established as an isolation location for potential COVID-19 patients. The jail spokesperson told ABS-CBN that \\"As of now, Manila City Jail remains COVID-19 free\\"; however, ABS-CBN noted that no one at the facility had been tested. In April 2020, the international non-governmental organisation Human Rights Watch expressed the concern that, due to incomplete reporting by the Philippine government, COVID-19 might be spreading more quickly and widely within Philippine detention centers than it appeared.  Facility  The Manila City Jail has the capacity to house 1,100 inmates. Operating at an average of 463.6% occupancy, detention centers in the Philippines are the second most overcrowded in the world. , there were 4,800 inmates in the Manila City Jail. In December 2018, the Philippines topped the list of countries with the most overcrowded prisons, with the average facility population exceeding 600% capacity. At that time, the Manila City Jail was housing 6,300 inmates, 90% of whom were pretrial detainees. Also as of December 2018, the ratio of guards to inmates was 1:200, considerably higher than international guidelines which recommend a ratio of 1:7. In January 2019, The New York Times reported that during one shift the ratio was 1:528. Due to overcrowding, inmates sleep in shifts. Many sleep side by side on all available floor space and stairways, including in hallways and bathrooms. Some do not have room to lay down and must sleep sitting up. Those who can afford it pay other inmates, who act as dorm leaders, to allow them to sleep in 2×2 metre cubicles called . Although gangs are forbidden, officials allow them to operate because they help maintain order. A spokesman for the Manila City Jail told The New York Times in 2019, \\"Formally, we don’t allow inmates to police other inmates. Informally, we do because of a lack of resources.\\" The gangs self-enforce rules such as those forbidding fighting and approaching other inmates' visitors. They also maintain communal funds and help distribute food, which is scarce within the facility.  Human rights concerns  Leah Armamento, a member of the Philippine government's Commission on Human Rights, has said that the overcrowding in Philippine jails constitutes torture according to the United Nations Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture. The international NGO Human Rights Watch raised concerns in April 2020 that COVID-19 was spreading more quickly and widely in Philippine detention centers than reporting suggested, and urged authorities to investigate the causes of deaths in the facilities, reduce prison populations, and implement other measures to prevent the spread of the virus.

Located in Midtown Atlanta, the sculpture was unveiled in 2017.  History  In 2017, Midtown Alliance (a coalition of business and civic leaders in Atlanta) announced that Rockspinner, a sculpture at the intersection of Peachtree Street and 10th Street in Midtown Atlanta, would be removed on April 3, to be relocated to another city. Earlier in the year, the alliance took bids for a sculpture that would replace Rockspinner, planning to debut the new piece in the summer. Several months later, on June 30, a replacement sculpture was installed called Autoeater. The sculpture, carved from Carrara marble, depicts a Fiat Panda being consumed by a distorted creature. The sculpture, which weighs , was designed by Julia Venske and Gregor Spänle and created in Italy, being shipped to Atlanta from a marble quarry near Tuscany after its completion. Discussing the thought behind the sculpture, Venske said, “For us, [Atlanta’s] a lot of the traffic and it’s a lot about the forest. But the traffic is just really obvious.” A statement by the Midtown Alliance claims the sculpture “invites comment on Atlanta’s relationship with the automobile in the context of one of the city’s most walkable urban districts.” A 2020 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution claims the piece \\"also has a suggestive sexual connotation, as if the car — symbol of capitalist might upended to reveal its rarely seen undercarriage — is being enveloped in an enormous prophylactic.\\" The sculpture was slated for removal in Summer 2020, though the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a delay in its removal.

It is also called as निषाद. More information and importance of Nishada The following is the information about Nishada and its importance in Indian classical music: * Nishada is the seventh svara in an octave or Saptak. * Nishada is the immediate next svara of Dhaivat (Dha). * The svara of Nishada is Komal and Shuddha. * It is said that Sadja is the basic svara from which all the other 6 svaras are produced. When we break the word Sadja then we get, Shad And Ja. It means that Shad is 6 and ja is 'giving birth' in Marathi.https://saxonianfolkways.wordpress.com/2013/01/30/the-7-shadows-of- shadja So basically the translation is : षड् - 6, ज -जन्म . Therefore, it collectively means giving birth to the other 6 notes of the music. So the svara Ni is formed from Sadja. * The frequency of Nishada is 450 Hz. The frequencies of the 7 svaras are also given below: Sa 240 Hz, Re 270 Hz, Ga 300 Hz, Ma 320 Hz, Pa 360 Hz, Dha 400 Hz, and Ni 450 Hz, Sa 480 Hz (Taar Saptak) ........ (and so on). Consequently, the Ni after the Dha of 900 Hz (Taar Saptak) has a frequency of 800 Hz i.e. the double of the Lower octave Ni. * There are Shruti's of Nishada. Previously the main Shruti, not only for Ni but for all the other svaras, was on the last Shruti but now it is considered to be on the 1st Shurti. For example, if these are the 2 Shruti's of Ni then, Previously this was the position of the main Shruti of Ni. ^ 1 2 ^ But now this position has become the main Shruti of Ni. * All the other svaras except Sadja(Sa) and Pancham (Pa) can be Komal or Tivra svaras but Sa and Pa are always Shuddha svaras. And hence svaras Sa and Pa are called Achal Svaras , since these svaras don't move from their original position. Svaras Ra, Ga, Ma, Dha, Ni are called Chal Svaras, since these svaras move from their original position. Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni - Shuddha Svaras Re, Ga, Dha, Ni - Komal Svaras Ma - Tivra Svaras * Ragas from Khamaj Thaat, Kafi Thaat, Asavari Thaat and Bhairavi Thaat have Komal Nishada. * Ragas where Ni is the Vadi svara - Raga Jaunpuri, Raga Tilang, etc. Ragas where Ni is the Samvadi svara - Raga Purvi, Raga Yaman, etc. * Hypothetically speaking, Ni is said to be Nirakar Bhrama, Nirakar Bhrama as in, the three main gods, Bhrama, Vishnu and Shiva were first created i.e. Sakar Bhrama (Sa) and then these three gods created Rishimuni i.e. Re and then Gandharvas were created for singing and then lord Indra or Raja Indra i.e. Mahipal was created and once the Mahipal (Raja) or the king was created, the Praja or the common citizens or the people were made, and as people have their own Dharma or duty/religion, the religion was made, when religion was made the Nirakar form of Bhrama is formed i.e. Dharma created the Nirakar form of Bhrama (Ni). Ni is made the acronym of Nirakar Bhrama for showing the importance of the syllable Ni. So it started with Sakar Bhrama (Sa) and ends with Nirakar Bhrama (Ni). https://www.quora.com/What-is- the-significance-of-Seven-Sur-Sa-Re-Ga-Ma-Pa-Dha-Ni-Sa-in-music * Nishada is said to be sourced from the trumpeting of the elephant.https://adharashadja.wordpress.com/2017/03/21/swara-and- shruti/#:~:text=SHRUTIShttps://www.dollsofindia.com/library/raga_ragini/ * Nishada is associated with the planet Venus. https://adharashadja.wordpress.com/2017/03/21/swara-and- shruti/#:~:text=SHRUTIS * Nishada is associated with Multi colours. https://adharashadja.wordpress.com/2017/03/21/swara-and- shruti/#:~:text=SHRUTIS References * https://www.quora.com/What-is-the- significance-of-Seven-Sur-Sa-Re-Ga-Ma-Pa-Dha-Ni-Sa-in-music See also * List of Ragas in Hindustani classical music * Svara * Shruti (music) * Chalan * Ṣaḍja (Sa) * Ṛiṣabha (Re) * Gāndhāra (Ga) * Madhyama (music) (Ma) * Panchama (Pa) * Dhaivat (Dha) \\\\---- Ni (svara) Category:Hindustani music Category:Carnatic music References ","title":"Niṣāda"},{"id":"65358649","text":"The Gobbler Formation is a geologic formation in the Sacramento Mountains of New Mexico.Pray 1954 It preserves fossils dating back to the Moscovian Age of the Pennsylvanian Period.Kues and Giles 2004 Description The Gobbler Formation consists of a lower section of of quartz sandstone and limestone and an upper section of over of shales and quartz sandstones.

Described by the Minneapolis Star Tribune as the \\"First Lady of Minnesota Civil Rights,\\" she was instrumental in the success of a fair housing bill in Minnesota in 1962. The first Black person appointed to the University of Minnesota Board of Regents, Johnson has been a lifelong advocate for equity in housing, education, and voting rights. Early life and education Josie Robinson was born in San Antonio, Texas, on October 7, 1930. She grew up in Houston, Texas and worked for her grandmother at a pharmacy in West Houston. Johnson credited her family with her strong sense of justice, describing her heritage as \\"wonderfully strong, hard-working, independent women.\\" As a teenager, Johnson and her father went door to door gathering signatures on a petition against a poll tax. Johnson would accompany her mother in visits to tutor illiterate white women in their kitchens. Johnson attended Fisk University and earned a bachelor's degree in sociology in 1951. She met her husband, Charles W. Johnson, while at Fisk. He was hired as an engineer by Honeywell in 1956 and they moved to Minneapolis; they had three daughters together. She also received a master's of arts and a doctor of education degree at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Activism After moving to Minnesota, she became a community organizer for the local affiliate office of the Urban League, holding the acting director position from 1967 to 1968, and became active in the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party. She was an officer in the Minneapolis chapter of the NAACP and held a position in the Minneapolis chapter of Jack and Jill of America, an organization dedicated to improving the quality of life for children. Johnson worked with the League of Women Voters in Minnesota in collaboration with Black and Jewish neighborhood associations to set up Fair Employment Practice Commissions in Minneapolis, St. Paul, and Minnesota. She was the first Black woman to be appointed to the National Board of the League of Women Voters. She was particularly adept at behind-the-scenes politicking. During the Minnesota legislative session of 1961, she lobbied every day at the State Capitol building for fair housing. When the bill she was promoting was stagnating in a state Senate committee, she visited Governor Elmer Andersen. The bill moved forward with the governor's support and was the first state fair housing bill passed in the United States. Johnson led the Minnesota delegation for the August 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in Washington, D.C. She also traveled to Mississippi in 1964 with an interfaith, interracial delegation of women called Wednesdays in Mississippi, taking part in the Freedom Summer campaign to provide support and supplies to civil rights workers and black families. The group Johnson was traveling with visited a freedom school in Vicksburg, Mississippi, which was bombed later that same day. She worked as a mayoral aide for Arthur Naftalin in Minneapolis in 1968, when racial tensions were high in the city, acting as a community liaison. U.S. Senator Walter Mondale described Johnson's activism during the 1960s: She left Minnesota for several years to take a number of significant political roles. From 1975 to 1978, she was the chief of staff to the lieutenant governor of Colorado. In 1978 she supervised the campaign staff for Judson Robinson in Texas. Johnson also spent time in Tennessee in 1980, serving as the deputy campaign manager for the 1980 campaign for President Jimmy Carter. =Activism in education= In the late 1960s and 1970s, Johnson expanded her efforts to improving education. From 1971 to 1973, she served as the first African American member of the Board of Regents of the University of Minnesota. When the Minnesota Student Mobilization Committee organized a rally protesting the Vietnam War in 1973, Johnson addressed the crowd, urging students to commit to long-term activism to make substantive changes to society. She helped found the African American Studies department at the University of Minnesota and taught as one of the first faculty members, teaching a course on Black families in white America. Johnson joined the faculty of the university's college of education in the 1980s as well as serving as a senior fellow at the Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs. From 1990 to 1992 Johnson was the diversity director of the All-University Forum. In 1992 she was appointed associate vice president for academic affairs, leading the school's diversity efforts. She held that position until retiring from the university in 1996. =Later activism= Johnson was a superdelegate for Minnesota at the 2008 Democratic National Convention where she cast her vote for Barack Obama. She has served on the board of trustees for the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and other Minnesota organizations. Into her late 80s, she continues to be politically active, participating in Black Lives Matter protests and urging reform. Interviewed about the 2020 killing of George Floyd, she discussed the historical context around the protests in the continued fight for equal opportunities for African Americans. Awards and legacy Some of the notable awards Johnson has received include the Committed to the Vision Award from the Minneapolis Civil Rights Department, as well as the African American Community Endowment Fund Award. The University of Minnesota established the Josie Robinson Johnson Human Rights and Social Justice Award in 1997. In 2018, the University of Minnesota Humphrey School of Public Affairs established the Josie Robinson Johnson Fellowship for students focusing on racial inequities and injustice. The same year, civil rights leader Vernon Jordan lauded Johnson at an event in her honor: Her 2019 memoir, Hope in the Struggle, provides insights into her life's work as well as the racial history of the Twin Cities.

One of the production's challenges was to have Julie Harris believably age by 60 years from age 18 to age 78. NBC makeup artist Bob O'Bradovich used a combination of makeup and various devices, including a rubber mask and false nose to achieve the effect. One reviewer noted that the devices were a debit to the production, as Harris seemed \\"barely animated\\" behind the layers of latex. The production aired on NBC on November 30, 1961, as part of the Hallmark Hall of Fame series. Reception =Reviews= In The New York Times, Jack Gould described Harris' performance as impeccable, magnificent, inspired, touching, and \\"a work of flowing ecstasy and poignancy.\\" Gould also credited Robert O'Bradovich with a triumph for his makeup work. In the Los Angeles Times, Cecil Smith called it \\"a rich and delicately woven tapestry that gave television its most rewarding 90 minutes of the season.\\" For special honors, he called out Harris (\\"a superb performance\\"), Warren Clymer (scenery), and Noel Taylor (costumes). Cynthia Lowry of the Associated Press wrote that it was \\"beautifully produced\\" and \\"meticulously performed\\". However, partly due to the shadow cast by Helen Hayes who played the role in the original stage production, Lowry opined that Harris \\"never was convincing as the great imperious queen\\". Fred Danzig of the UPI wrote: \\"Beautiful, beautiful acting. Sensible and sensitive direction by George Schaefer. And my compliments to Miss Harris's makeup man – 60 years from start to finish – was accomplished with impressive skill.\\" Danzig also praised writer Robert Hartung for improving upon the original play. In January 1962, Percy Shain of The Boston Globe selected Victoria Regina as television's best drama of 1961, noting that it was a \\"fairly easy\\" pick. =Emmy Awards= The production was nominated for seven Emmy Awards. It won three: \\"program of the year\\"; Julie Harris as best actress for her performance as Victoria; and Pamela Brown as best actress in a supporting role for her performance as the queen's mother. Additional nominations included James Donald as best actor for his role as Prince Albert and Barry Jones as best actor in a supporting role for his role as the Dean.

The case is notable for having originated the 'Briginshaw principle', a legal doctrine deriving from Justice Dixon's obiter remarks within the case. In its present conception, the Briginshaw principle is understood to mean that 'the strength of evidence necessary to establish facts on the balance of probabilities, may depend on the nature of what is sought to be proven.' In particular the principle requires that clear, cogent or strict proof be necessary to support a judicial finding of serious allegations such as fraud. The case also served to confirm that the balance of probabilities is the applicable standard of proof in civil proceedings, subject to statute. Prior to Briginshaw, due to the state of the law in England at the time; Australian law regarding the onus of proof in divorce cases 'was a little confused'. – via Austlii. Briginshaw is the eighth most cited decision of the High Court.  Facts  At dispute was a petition for divorce by a Mr Frederick Briginshaw against his wife Clarice Briginshaw. The petition relied upon an allegation that Mrs Briginshaw was adulterous. This petition was dismissed by Martin J of the Supreme Court of Victoria, who had found insufficient evidence to support an adultery allegation. The judge had evaluated the evidence presented at trial at the beyond reasonable doubt standard. The High Court appeal was pleaded on the grounds that: (1) The judge had wrongly decided he needed to be satisfied at the beyond reasonable doubt standard, before making a finding that adultery had occurred; (2) The judge's reasons showed he would have made that finding if the balance of probabilities standard had been applied; (3) He should have been so satisfied, or (4) a new hearing should take place. All submissions relied upon the plaintiff's contention that the balance of probabilities should have been the standard to apply..  Judgement  = On the facts = The court found that divorce matters were within the court's civil jurisdiction, with onus of proof determined by statutory interpretation. The applicable statute was the Marriage Act 1928 (VIC), which relevantly stated:Marriage Act 1928 (VIC) s80 & 86 > \\"... upon any petition for dissolution of marriage it shall be the duty of > the Court to satisfy itself so far as it reasonably can as to the facts\\" and > \\"... if the Court is satisfied ... it shall pronounce a decree ...\\" The court held that in a civil jurisdiction the word 'satisfied' did not mean proof 'beyond reasonable doubt', but something lower. However, by majority the court held that the primary judge's reasons didn't indicate he would've found in favor of the plaintiff, even if he'd evaluated the evidence at that lower standard. Therefore, the appeal was dismissed. = The Briginshaw principle = In a passage often cited by subsequent courts, Justice Dixon stated what has since become known as the 'Briginshaw principle' by writing: > 'Except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution, it is enough > that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable > satisfaction of the tribunal. But reasonable satisfaction is not a state of > mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and > consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. The seriousness of an > allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given > description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular > finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question > whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the > tribunal. In such matters “reasonable satisfaction” should not be produced > by inexact proofs, indefinite testimony, or indirect inferences. Everyone > must feel that, when, for instance, the issue is on which of two dates an > admitted occurrence took place, a satisfactory conclusion may be reached on > materials of a kind that would not satisfy any sound and prudent judgment if > the question was whether some act had been done involving grave moral > delinquency' - Dixon J. Justice Rich said of the standard of proof; > 'In a serious matter like a charge of adultery, the satisfaction of a just > and prudent mind could not be produced by slender and exiguous proofs or > circumstances pointing with a wavering finger to an affirmative > conclusion'..  Significance  The Briginshaw principle has since been enacted in Australia's uniform evidence law. For example, s140(2)(c) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) sets out that 'gravity of the matters alleged' as a relevant consideration for proving a case on the balance of probabilities; a subsumption of the Briginshaw principle. The principle has been applied in civil cases relating to anti-discrimination and sexual harassment, due to the relative seriousness of those types of civil allegations. It has been argued by the academic Loretta De Plevitz that Tribunals have misunderstood the Briginshaw principle as establishing an additional standard of proof, rather than as articulating a nuance subsumed within the balance of probabilities standard. – via Austlii. In the judicial context, similar remarks have been made by Justice Heerey in 2008.. The High Court restated the principle sixty years later in an attempt at clarification. They wrote: > \\"The ordinary standard of proof required of a party who bears the onus in > civil litigation in this country is proof on the balance of probabilities. > That remains so even where the matter to be proved involves criminal conduct > or fraud. On the other hand, the strength of the evidence necessary to > establish a fact or facts on the balance of probabilities may vary according > to the nature of what it is sought to prove. Thus, authoritative statements > have often been made to the effect that clear or cogent or strict proof is > necessary ‘where so serious a matter as fraud is to be found’. Statements to > that effect should not, however, be understood as directed to the standard > of proof. Rather, they should be understood as merely reflecting a > conventional perception that members of our society do not ordinarily engage > in fraudulent or criminal conduct and a judicial approach that a court > should not lightly make a finding that, on the balance of probabilities, a > party to civil litigation has been guilty of such conduct.\\" . In a 2019 decision,. the New South Wales Supreme Court held that application of the Briginshaw principle should be confined to cases involving serious allegations analogous to fraud or dishonesty. However in assessing the evidence, the matters in s 140(2) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) remained applicable.

The school was founded on September 21, 1925. History =1925–1929= St Andrew High School was founded on September 21, 1925, through a partnership between the Presbyterian Church and the Wesleyan Synod of Jamaica. A fund of £6,000 was initially established to found the Jamaica High School for Girls, a fee-paying institution. Under the terms of the agreement, the school enrolled both boarders and day girls and was to be located near Kingston. In early 1925, the parties secured the former Cecelio Lodge House on eight acres of land—with gardens, tennis courts and a hockey field—from Kingston businessman Cecil Lindo. The house was refurbished, and dormitories, classrooms and staff rooms were added. On September 21, 1925, the Jamaica High School for Girls opened with 21 scholars (10 \\"day girls\\" and 11 \\"boarders\\"). September 21 continues to be celebrated annually as the school's Founder's Day. The first headmistress was Miss Jenny Gartshore, who served for only one term. Her sister, Miss Margaret Gartshore, assumed the position and served the school for 31 years with Miss Doris \\"Stocky\\" Stockhausen as Vice-Principal. =1929–1957= In October 1929, the school qualified to become a government grant-aided secondary school. There were 153 students, of whom 51 were boarders. The Jamaica Schools' Commission recommended that the name be changed to St. Andrew High School for Girls. In 1940, the school had 270 students—68 boarders and 202 daytime attendees. A building and expansion programme was initiated, which would take several years to complete and was estimated to cost £6,000. The school population changed from exclusively fee-paying students to include students who had gained \\"free\\" or \\"grant-aided\\" places as a result of their performance in the Common Entrance Examination. =1957–1968= In 1957, Miss Mary Dawson became the second principal of the school. In 1958, the Common Entrance Examination was introduced, resulting in an increase in government grant-in-aid to cover the tuition fees for those students awarded \\"free places\\" and \\"grant-aided places\\". In the same year, St. Andrew High School separated into two schools - St. Andrew High School (a secondary education institution) and St. Andrew Preparatory School for children aged 4 to 11 years. Principal Dawson spearheaded the development of science, initiating the teaching of physics by arranging for girls to attend classes at Calabar High School until the school’s physics lab was ready in 1963. In 1965, the school closed its boarding facilities to create space for additional classrooms to facilitate newly introduced subjects—craft, commercial and home economics. =1968–present= In 1968, Mrs. Fay Saunders became the first Jamaican headmistress of the school. In 1974 she resigned to take up an appointment as Senator and Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Education. In 1974, Miss Joan Reader became the second Jamaican headmistress of the school. She oversaw the implementation of the second shift in 1978—a Ministry of Education initiative to cope with a burgeoning post-independence school population, and an increasing expectation that secondary education would be provided for the entire 12–16 year old cohort of the population. House system Upon initial enrollment in the school, each student is assigned to one of six houses. Originally there were four houses: Anderson (named after Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, the first woman to qualify as a physician and surgeon in Britain); Arc (named for the heroine and saint, Joan of Arc), Cavell (named for Edith Cavell, a British World War I nurse), and Darling (named for Grace Darling, the daughter of a lighthouse keeper who helped to rescue sailors from a shipwreck in 1838). In 1973, two more houses were added for a total of six: Gartshore (named after Margaret Gartshore, the first headmistress); and Stockhausen (named after Doris Stockhausen, the first vice-principal). Enrollment The school's official capacity is 1,600 students. As of the 2018-2019 academic year, there were 1,558 students enrolled with a staff complement of ninety-five (95) teachers, including a guidance counselor and a school nurse. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable mw-collapsible\\" + - ! scope=\\"col\\"  School Year ! scope=\\"col\\"  Enrollment ! scope=\\"col\\"  Student-Teacher Ratio - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2018-2019  style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  1,558  style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  17:1 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2017-2018  style=\\"text- align: center;\\"  1,571  style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  19:1 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2016-2017  style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  1,545  style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  22:1 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2015-2016  style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  1,564  style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  22:1 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2014-2015  style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  1,567  style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  21:1 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2013-2014  style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  1,520  style=\\"text- align: center;\\"  21:1 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2012-2013  style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  1,550  style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  21:1 } Headmistresses and principals * Miss Jenny Gartshore (1925) * Miss Margaret Gartshore (1925-1957) * Miss Mary Dawson (1957-1968) * Mrs Fay Saunders (1968-1974) * Miss Joan Reader (1974-1988) * Mrs Dahlia Mills-Repole (1989-2000) * Mrs Sharon Reid (2000-2019) * Miss Keeva Ingram (2019–present) Notable alumnae * Michelle Cliff, Jamaican-American author * Nicole Dennis-Benn, Jamaican novelist * Parisa Fitz-Henley, Jamaican-born actress * Barbara Gloudon, Jamaican journalist, author, and playwright * Maxine Henry-Wilson, Jamaican educator and politician * Elsa Leo-Rhynie, Jamaican academic and university administrator * Yendi Phillips, Jamaican TV host, model and beauty queen * Sylvia Wynter, Jamaican novelist and dramatist References Category:Girls' schools in Jamaica Category:Educational institutions established in 1925 Category:Buildings and structures in Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica Category:1925 establishments in Jamaica ","title":"St Andrew High School"},{"id":"65359092","text":"A mass shooting took place on September 19, 2020, in Rochester, New York, United States, at a late-night backyard party on Pennsylvania Avenue. Two people were killed and fourteen others were injured. No arrests have been made. It is considered the largest mass shooting in Rochester in recent memory. Background The city police has been mired in scandal in the wake of the killing of Daniel Prude. Mayor Lovely Warren fired police chief La'Ron Singletary on the Monday prior to the shooting, and he had been replaced by Mark Simmons. On the day preceding the shooting, the city council authorized an investigation into Prude's death. House parties have been a cause of violence in Rochester in the months prior to the shooting, as well as being an issue for COVID-19 containment. After 70 people were shot in a six-week span between June 1 to July 15, Mayor Warren issued an emergency order banning public gatherings of five or more people between 11:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. as well as banning indoor gatherings of more than 10 people in locations without a liquor license. Warren said that the shootings happened at late night parties on city streets. Her order was protested by residents, including Free the People Roc and the Coalition for Black Lives, the groups saying \\"the city has shown a complete disregard for black lives as they continue to criminalize black and brown for simply existing in their neighborhoods.\\"  Incident  The shooting took place at a party that was intended to be small, however it was joined by people from two adjacent parties. Following an argument, three or four people opened fire with handguns. Police recovered more than forty bullet casings from the crime scene. At 12:25 a.m. on September 19, the Rochester Police Department responded to calls of gunfire at a neighborhood near the Rochester Public Market and arrived to find about 100 people running down the street from the gunfire. In the night following the shooting, a large police response force was near Rochester Public Market.  Victims  Two people were killed in the shooting, both aged 19. According to the police, they were bystanders and were not intentionally targeted by the gunmen. Fourteen others were wounded, all aged between 17 and 23 years old.  Reactions  Speaking in the hours after the incident, interim police chief Mark Simmons described the event as \\"another tragedy where individuals are having these illegal, unsanctioned house parties taking place in these properties, which number one is not safe because of the COVID-19 pandemic, because of the conditions. And then you add in alcohol and violence and it just becomes a recipe for disaster\\". Police did not identify any suspects yet, were uncertain if there were multiple shooters, and do not have any suspects in custody. Mayor Warren called for the community to remain calm and exercise restraint as the police department investigates, and offered counselling for all affected by the shooting.

Early life Abdullah was the eldest son of Faisal bin Turki bin Abdullah who managed to rule the state, the Emirate of Najd, for 26 years. He had three brothers: Saud, Mohammad and Abdul Rahman. During the reign of Faisal bin Turki there was a rivalry between his sons, Abdullah and Saud. In addition, they had different personalities in that the latter was much more liberal, but the former was a strict religious man. Heir apparent and reign Abdullah was made heir apparent by his father, Faisal bin Turki, who died in 1865, and Abdullah became the ruler of the state. When Abdullah was crown prince he enjoyed great power. Following his accession to the throne Abdullah attempted to centralize the power. Although Abdullah was backed by his uncle Abdullah bin Turki whose descendants are known as Al Turki branch, and the Wahhabi leaders, and also, his succession was not problematic, his brother Saud attacked Abdullah's rule. Abdullah demanded the assistance of the Ottoman forces to defeat Saud. Following their involvement in the struggle the Ottoman forces gained Al Hasa in 1871 which remained under the rule of the Ottoman state until 1913 when Abdulaziz bin Abdul Rahman took over the region. Saud won the struggle in 1871, but at the same time a civil war broke out which lasted for more than a decade. Following the brief rule of Saud Abdullah regained the throne. The alliance between Abdullah and Ottomans ended in 1872 due to the former's reluctance to continue the cooperation. Abdullah's second term ended in 1873 when Saud again became the ruler. This time the youngest brother, Abdul Rahman, ended the reign of Saud in 1875. However, Abdul Rahman's rule was very brief, and the same year Abdullah regained the power which lasted again very short. In 1887 Abdullah bin Faisal was imprisoned by Mohammed bin Saud, son of Saud bin Faisal. The Al Rashid rulers freed Abdullah as well his younger brother Abdul Rahman who were both taken to Hail and were made governors of the Al Rashid administration. Eventually Al Rashids forced the members of the Al Saud family to leave Riyadh. Personal life and death One of Abdullah bin Faisal's spouses was from the Al Rashidi dynasty. He died in 1889 or in Riyadh in 1890.

History The Kazan Military District was originally formed as a military district of the Russian Empire by a decree dated August 6, 1864. It included the territories of Kazan, Perm, Vyatka, Penza, Simbirsk, Saratov, Samara and Astrakhan provinces. Its headquarter was situated in Kazan. In 1881, it included the territory of the abolished Orenburg military district. The Astrakhan, Ural and Orenburg Cossack troops were subordinate to the command of the district. By a decree of March 30, 1918, the district was disbanded (in fact, the disbandment process continued until May 1918). In accordance with the decree of the Council of People's Commissars of the RSFSR dated May 4, 1918, the territory of the former Kazan Military District was divided between two newly created districts: the Volga Military District and the Ural Military District with headquarters in Samara and Yekaterinburg, respectively. The Kazan Military District was formed a second time directly after the Second World War on July 9, 1945. The territory of the district included the Kirov region, as well as the Tatar, Udmurt, Mari and Chuvash ASSRs. The district administration was formed on the basis of the field administration of the 48th Army. The headquarters of the district was also stationed in Kazan. By order of February 4, 1946, the district was reorganized into the Kazan territorial district, and the troops were transferred to the Volga Military District.

The subfamily is part of the family Percidae which also includes the perches, ruffes and pikeperches. The family is endemic to North America. It consists of 3-5 different genera and well over 200 species. Chararceteristics Species within the Etheostomatinae are all small fish, mostly less than in length and their bodies are slightly compressed or fusiform in shape. They have two pterygiophores between the first and second dorsal fins which do not have spines and they a reduced swimbladder which may be completely lacking. The name darter becomes because these fish are seen to dart around in their habitat and these fish have benthic habits. They are sexually dimorphic and most species have males with bright colours and patterning, particularly when breeding and these colours and patterns are used to attract females and allow for recognition of species as the colours and patterns are particular to each species. Many species use typical sites for spawning and they care for their eggs and fry. They have evolved a variety of methods of depositing eggs and these include burying them, which may be the basal habit as it is found in all genera, as well as attaching eggs to a substrate and egg clustering. Distribution Etheostomatinae darters are endemic to North America where they are found in the Mississippi River basin and the drainages of the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, the seaboards of the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific coast of Mexico.

Biography =Early life and career= Savory was born in Ponsonby in 1908. He was the oldest of five children and attended Auckland Grammar School until the age of 14 when he was forced to look for employment to help with family finances. He took a job as an office boy at the Auckland Gas Company. He found work as a carpenter and helped build many of the high quality houses in Remuera in the 1920s. After his five-year apprenticeship became a fully qualified chippie and joiner after taking night classes at the Seddon Memorial Technical College. Soon afterwards he lost his job after construction was cut short by the onset of the Great Depression. He proceeded to start his own building business leading him to public life. He founded R. Savory Ltd, a carpentry business which eventually became a full construction company. During World War II his company built barracks structures for American troops stationed in Warkworth and the Auckland Domain. The company later built Middlemore Hospital and Ardmore Airport. In 1947 he was elected President of the Auckland Master Builders Association. In 1951 he was made president of the New Zealand Builders' Federation. =Political career= In 1953 he stood on the Citizens & Ratepayers (C&R;) ticket for the Auckland City Council and was elected a member. He was re-elected in 1959 and 1962, holding a seat on the council for nine years. He was appointed chairman of the works and planning committee. In 1956 he introduced the first town plan of any city in New Zealand. In 1962 Savory was part of a group of C&R; councillors (alongside Charlie Passmore and Fred de Malmanche) who had persuaded the president of the Auckland Chamber of Commerce Edgar Faber to run for the Auckland mayoralty against Dove-Myer Robinson. They convinced him to do so by telling him exaggerated stories of Robinson's personal conduct and his behaviour during council business. Faber began to regret being involved in the mayoral contest as it began to affect his health and planned to withdraw from the race, but Savory and the other C&R; councillors insisted he continue. Shortly after the election Faber discovered he was dying of cancer and confided to Robinson that the C&R; trio had used him against Robinson for \\"purely mercenary ends\\". Savory had mayoral aspirations and frequently clashed with Mayor Dove-Myer Robinson. He described Robinson as a \\"troublemaking little upstart came along and stole the mayoralty\\" and as \\"a manipulating Jew boy\\". Savory's dislike of Robinson was more than mutual, originating in Robinson's opposition to a sewage dumping scheme (the Browns Island plan that would have discharged effluent into Waitematā Harbour) that Savory supported. He was a member of the Auckland Harbour Board and was chairman from 1961 to 1972. As chairman he oversaw the downtown redevelopment, with increasing skyscrapers, and also initiated the construction of Fergusson Wharf. After making exploratory visits to London and Oakland, California to examine containerisation he upgraded Auckland Harbour to accommodate container ships to ensure that the port remained logistically and financially viable. He was also a board member of the Auckland Technical Institute for over three decades. In his youth technical education had helped him in his career and maintained an interest in it all his life. He was chairman of the board for 28 years from 1952 to 1980. =Later life and death= In the 1965 Queen's Birthday Honours, Savory was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, in recognition of his services to local government and technical education. In the 1972 Queen's Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Knight Bachelor, for outstanding services to local government and education. Savory suffered from diabetes and in 1973 he had his right leg amputated below the knee, the result of circulatory problems. His wife Fai-Ola Savory predeceased him in 1983. He died in his sleep on 27 October 1989 aged 81. He was survived by two daughters and six grandchildren.

Description  The main ingredient is peperone crusco, a dried and crunchy pepper known for its sweet flavour and intense colour, which is a popular element in the local cuisine. Usually the Senise pepper variety is used, for its thin pulp and low water content which allows a rapid drying. It is served with homemade pasta like cavatelli, strascinati or ferretti (also known as frizzuli). The addition of stale bread crumbs makes this dish one of the best examples of peasant foods, that characterize the cuisine of Basilicata.  Preparation  The peppers are cleaned with a dry cloth, deprived of the stalk and the seeds to be, subsequently, flash-fried in hot olive oil, flavoured with a garlic clove which is removed before the cooking. The frying takes just a few seconds and they must be, immediately, extracted to avoid burns that compromise the flavour, giving an unpleasant taste. Frizzuli pasta with peperoni cruschi, bread crumbs and cacioricotta cheese Once set aside to cool (achieving their typical crispy texture) and, then, cut into small pieces, the bread crumbs are browned in the same oil. When the pasta is cooked, the ingredients are mixed and, finally, seasoned with a part of peppers. Optionally, grated pecorino or cacioricotta cheese is added.  Variations  Variations may include chickpeas and turnip greens. While it is essentially a vegan/vegetarian dish, several preparations also add sausage, cod or anchovy.

The sculpture was completed in 1635. It portrays Maurice of Savoy, of whom Duquesnoy became a \\"well-favored\\" in the 1630s. The bust is the final documented portrait by Duquesnoy. It is currently housed at the Galleria Sabauda in Turin. Sculpture The bust is indicative of a close collaboration between artist and commissioner, which lends credit to Gian Pietro Bellori's claim that Duquesnoy \\"became well-favored\\" by Maurizio. Bellori, one of Duquesnoy's biographers, made it a point that the bust (and Duquesnoy's final known portrait) was realized in 1635. Bellori wrote about the work: \\"Prince Maurizio, Cardinal of Savoy, made in marble in the year 1635.\\" Bellori added that Duquesnoy had \\"won great favor with this nobleman.\\" The Cardinal possibly was the only patron who managed to obtain Duquesnoy's services in the mid-1630s, when Duquesnoy's health was in steep decline. In the 1630s, Duquesnoy suffered from gout, attacks of vertigo and depression, which would debilitate him until his untimely death in 1643. Duquesnoy's poor health affected his productivity, which had been drastically decreasing since the early 1630s. This accounts, for example, for the delays in the completion of his Saint Susanna and in his payment for the same work. Bellori reports that while installing the Saint Susanna's metal palm, Duquesnoy had an attack of vertigo, fell from the ladder, and almost lost his life. Cardinal Maurizio might have opted for Duquesnoy after seeing the sculptor's Nano di Créqui. At the time, the Duke of Créqui was commanding his troops in Northern Italy as an ally of Victor Amadeus I, Duke of Savoy. The accurate rendering of facial hair is similar in the two sculptures, with a degree of finesse seldom seen in sculptures of high-ranking individuals of the day. According to Estelle Lingo, \\"Maurizio may have seen in this highly refined carving something akin to Van Dyck's ability to endow his sitters with a noble elegance conveyed by the paintstrokes themselves\\".

It is the southernmost part of the Downtown (Śródmieście) district, next to Solec and historical Frascati. The main thoroughfare passing through the neighbourhood is Ujazdów Avenue; the Chancellery of the Prime Minister of Poland, the Foreign Ministry and the Belweder Palace are located on or in the vicinity of the street. Ujazdów is an affluent neighbourhood, with villas, palaces and parks comprising most of its area. The most notable landmarks are the Łazienki Park and Palace on the Isle, the 18th century summer residence of Poland's last monarch Stanisław II Augustus. History The name derives from a 13th-century defensive fort (gród) and manor called Jazdów which belonged to the Masovian Dukes; its purpose was to defend the nearby settlement of Solec, which was a significant place of trade and commerce on the Vistula river.https://whu.org.pl/2015/06/25/ujazdow-rocznica-spalenia-grodu-na- jazdowie/#:~:text=Gr%C3%B3d%20na%20Jazdowie%20powsta%C5%82%20w,naje%C5%BAd%C5%BAcy%20przybyli%20cicho%20i%20podst%C4%99pnie. In 1262, the Grand Duke of Lithuania Mindaugas crossed the river with his troops and advanced towards Jazdów in an attempt to conquer Masovia. Duke Siemowit I and his oldest son, Konrad II, who were in Jazdów on a visit, prepared for a siege of the fortress whilst awaiting rescue from allies. However, the townsfolk betrayed the Duke and Mindaugas' troops managed to enter the fortress on 23 June 1262. According to most records, Siemowit I was killed by beheading during battle (or soon after) with the Lithuanians and Ruthenians. Konrad was captured and imprisoned, but released after two years. In 1281, the fort was abandoned and its inhabitants moved to a newly established settlement near present-day Old Town which gave rise to the city of Warsaw decades later. Archaeological excavations to determine the exact location of the previous fort proved futile. Ujazdów Avenue before 1939 The Duchy of Masovia became part of the Polish Kingdom in 1526 after the abrupt death of Janusz III. Bona Sforza, the Italian wife of Sigismund I, was suspected of poisoning the duke to annex the duchy, though no real evidence exists. Following the annexation of Warsaw and its surroundings, Queen Bona ordered the construction of a presumably wooden manor with a large forest-like park and a menagerie. On 12 January 1578, Jan Kochanowski's blank-verse tragedy The Dismissal of the Greek Envoys premiered at Ujazdów during the wedding of Jan Zamoyski and Krystyna Radziwiłł. The residence was demolished by king Sigismund III who ordered the construction of Ujazdów Castle on its site. The castle was completed in 1624 and now houses the Museum of Modern Art. The forested area of Ujazdów closer to the river was designated by Stanisław II Augustus as a Baths Park (Polish: Łazienki), with a private palace obtained from nobleman Stanisław Herakliusz Lubomirski. The chateau was reconstructed in a neoclassical style in the middle of a pond, earning it the names \\"Palace on the Isle\\" and \\"Palace on the Water\\". It is one of Warsaw's most recognizable landmarks. Up until the 19th century, Ujazdów remained more of a city periphery with smaller-scale dwellings and mansions belonging to aristocrats. It was also a summer retreat for Warsaw's wealthier and upper classes. In 1896, the Ujazdów Park became open to the public. Ujazdów Castle and Piaseczno Canal in winter Palace on the Isle at dusk Chancellery on Ujazdów Avenue Ujazdów did not suffer major destruction unlike the rest of Warsaw during World War II as it was designated as a neighbourhood for Nazi officials and German settlers.
