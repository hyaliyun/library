Researchers have found out that this protein, along with the other LRRC8 proteins LRRC8B, LRRC8C, LRRC8D, and LRRC8E, is a subunit of the heteromer protein volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC). (VRACs) are crucial to the regulation of cell size by transporting chloride ions and various organic osmolytes, such as taurine or glutamate, across the plasma membrane, and that is not the only function these channels have been linked to. While LRRC8A is one of many proteins that can be part of VRAC, it is the most important subunit for the channel‚Äôs ability to function. However, while we know it is necessary for VRAC function, other studies have found that it is not sufficient for the full range of usual VRAC activity. This is where the other LRRC8 proteins come in, as the different composition of these subunits affects the range of specificity for VRACs. The transmembrane portion of LRRC8 proteins are similar to those in Pannexins. LRRC8A alone can form a hexameric VRAC, for which the cyro-EM structure has been determined in its mice and human versions.

In the end, his passion proved stronger than his virtue and he took Sharmistha as his second wife who gives birth to three sons Druhyu, Anu and Puru.http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01083.htm Eventually Devayani comes to know about her husband's relation with Sharmistha and complains to her father. Shukracharya curses Yayati with old age for giving pain to his daughter. But later he tells him that if one of his sons could take his old age and give him his youth back, he could escape from the curse for some time. Yayati asks his sons for their youth but everyone rejects except Sharmistha's son Puru. Yayati makes him his descendant, who gives rise to Kuru vansha later. Later Sharmistha is blessed for her sacrifices and is converted to a constellation after her death. The constellation Cassiopeia (constellation) is the Western name for Sharmistha.

Now known as Brunswick Golden Isles Airport , it was previously known as Glynco Jetport following NAS Glynco's closure. It is a public airport located 5 miles (8 km) north of the city of Brunswick, in Glynn County, Georgia, USA. The airport has a single runway and is mostly used for general aviation, but it is also served by one commercial airline. History=World War II= In August 1942, the United States Navy began building the air station on in the northern part of the county. Named NAS Glynco as an abbreviation of Glynn County, Georgia, it was initially constructed as an operational base for lighter-than-air airships, more commonly known as blimps. In 14 months, workers at the new air station built two enormous wooden hangars, measuring long, wide and tall, to house an eight-ship fleet and to provide maintenance for blimps from other bases. Airship Patrol Squadron 15 (ZP-15), a subordinate unit of Fleet Airship Wing One at Lakehurst Maxfield Field was subsequently based at NAS Glynco and was the principal unit based at the air station during World War II. Capable of sustained flight and state-of-the-art electronic submarine detection, blimps flew thousands of hours on coastal and maritime patrol, as well as convoy escort duty, protecting vulnerable ships delivering essential war materials. This convoy escort program has often been cited as one of the most successful defense operations of the war. A runway for fixed- wing aircraft was also constructed at NAS Glynco, as multiple units on the base continued to contribute to significant advances in the development of new communications and electronics equipment, as well as new search and rescue procedures. =Postwar/Cold War= NAS Glynco was originally slated for decommissioning in 1949 when tensions in Korea prompted the Navy to reconsider the value of the airship's anti-submarine warfare capabilities. As a result, the base was retained in an active status and a full complement of blimps returned to NAS Glynco, primarily under Airship Patrol Squadrons 2 (ZP-2) and 3 (ZP-3). In addition, airship pilot training for previously designated heavier-than-air Naval Aviators from the fixed-wing and rotary-wing communities was conducted by the Airship Training Unit (ZTG) at NAS Glynco, which had moved from NAS Lakehurst in 1954. Other training functions followed. However, the Navy began to slowly dismantle the airship program and disestablished ZP-2, ZP-3 and ZTG in 1959. The mammoth blimp hangars finally succumbed to the effects of time and climate and the unique landmarks were demolished in 1971. =Cold War/Vietnam War= Aerial view of NAS Glynco in the early 1960s T-39D Sabreliner trainer, BuNo 150984, of VT-86 at NAS Pensacola in 1975, shortly after arriving from NAS Glynco As lighter-than-air operations declined, fixed-wing aircraft operations increased as NAS Glynco's runway was increased in length to slightly over . In the 1960s, as the Navy expanded the role of Naval Aviation Observers, later redesignated as Naval Flight Officers (NFO), for the next generation of carrier-based multi-crew aircraft, NAS Glynco assumed added responsibility for advanced NFO training. The former Naval Air Technical Training Center Glynco was disestablished and Training Air Wing EIGHT (TRAWING 8), reporting to the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, Texas was established at NAS Glynco in NATTC's place. Training Squadron 86 (VT-86) was subsequently established as a subordinate command to TRAWING 8 in order to provide advanced training for U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps NFOs slated for eventual assignment as Radar Intercept Officers (RIO) in the F-4 Phantom II and F-14 Tomcat, Bombardier Navigators (B/N) in the A-3 Skywarrior, A-5 Vigilante and A-6 Intruder, Reconnaissance Attack Navigators (RAN) in the RA-5C Vigilante, Reconnaissance Systems Officers (RSO) in the RF-4B Phantom II, Electronic Warfare Officers in the EA-3B Skywarrior, Electronic Countermeasures Officers in the EA-6A Intruder and EA-6B Prowler, Combat Information Center Officers (CICO) in the E-2 Hawkeye, and as Tactical Coordinators (TACCO) in the S-3 Viking. While at NAS Glynco, VT-86 operated a combination of 24 T-39 Sabreliner, 20 A-4C Skyhawk, 2 EC-121K Warning Star, and 12 TS-2A Tracker aircraft. During this time, the Navy also examined adding three additional runways and enlarging NAS Glynco into a Master Jet Base. Although this expansion was never executed, it was later employed at other installations, such as Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia; Naval Air Station Miramar, California; Naval Air Station Lemoore, California and the former Naval Air Station Cecil Field, Florida. In March 1962, NAS Glynco's mission expanded when the Navy's enlisted air traffic control schools transferred from Naval Air Technical Training Unit (NATTU) Olathe at Naval Air Station Olathe near Gardner, Kansas The Air Traffic Control Schools Division of Naval Air Technical Training Center (NATTC) Glynco was subsequently established, providing \\"A\\" School, \\"B\\" School and \\"O\\" School instruction for U.S. Navy enlisted personnel in the Air Controller (AC) rating and similar training for enlisted U.S. Marines in the air traffic control military occupational speciality (MOS). =Cold War/Post-Vietnam War and Base Closure= NAS Glynco was identified for closure by the end of 1974, part of a wide-ranging series of post-Vietnam budget reduction base closures that shuttered such installations as Naval Air Station Albany, Georgia (formerly Turner AFB), Naval Air Station Quonset Point, Rhode Island, McCoy AFB, Florida and Kincheloe Air Force Base. As part of the base closure process, TRAWING 8 was disestablished and VT-86 was transferred to Training Air Wing SIX (TRAWING 6) at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida where it continues to train USN and USMC NFOs for the F/A-18F Super Hornet, F/A-18D Hornet, and EA-18G Growler. Until recently, USAF Navigators/Combat Systems Officers destined for weapon systems officer (WSO) duties in the F-15E Strike Eagle and B-1B Lancer were also trained by VT-86; however, the Air Force's 479th Flying Training Group (also located at NAS Pensacola) now performs these duties. The Air Traffic Control Operations and Maintenance Schools were initially relocated to NATTC Millington at the former NAS Memphis and current Naval Support Activity Mid- South, Tennessee and are now located with NATTC Pensacola at NAS Pensacola, Florida. At the time of its closure, NAS Glynco had been a strong influence in Glynn County for over 31 years, both economically and as an element of local identity, and its closure took the local community by surprise. The Glynn County community took control of its destiny when a group of 19 community leaders formed the Glynco Steering Committee to attract new civilian users to the airfield. Their efforts paid off in 1975 when the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) selected NAS Glynco's former lighter-than-air/blimp site for a consolidated training academy for federal law enforcement personnel. The community retained the airfield, which was designated the official county municipal airport in 1975. Both developments proved to be invaluable to the future of Brunswick and the Golden Isles. Contributions to the local economy and population of Glynn County by the FLETC have had considerable impact and the jet runway has been an important community asset. The Glynn County Airport Commission was established in 1980 to manage and develop new opportunities for both the Brunswick and St. Simons Island airports. Since then, the Airport Commission has continued to improve service and facilities through a series of upgrades and repairs. To accurately reflect the destination for travelers and pilots, the Glynco Jetport was renamed Brunswick Golden Isles Airport in 2003. The new passenger terminal, completed in 2005 on the site of the former Navy air traffic control tower and base operations building, reflects the local tradition of hospitality for passengers of scheduled carrier service. Subsequent improvements have encouraged the expansion of general aviation, charter airline and scheduled airline traffic as well. The previous Navy control tower has not been replaced by the FAA and the airport currently has no active control tower.

Contests between schools take place throughout the school year. Knowledge Bowl participants earn prizes depending on their standings.  Format  Each game starts out with two teams with four contestants on each team. Two rounds lasting 7 minutes are played when toss-up questions are asked dealing with many subjects. If a team member gets a question right, they get a bonus question to answer in which the team can discuss. If a team member gets a toss-up question wrong, the question goes to the other team to answer. If one of them gets it right, then that team gets a bonus question. Toss ups are worth 10 points and bonuses are worth 20 points. Points are not taken away for incorrect answers to toss up or bonus questions; however, if someone buzzes in too early with an incorrect response, a 5-point penalty is assessed. In between the two rounds, an interview session is done with the contestants. After the second round, a \\"Lightning Round\\" composing of current events questions takes place. During this round, only toss ups are asked to save time. This round is dubbed as the \\"Fastest Four Minutes In Television.\\" Whoever has the highest point total at the end of the game wins and advances in the next round.  Hosts  For 18 years (1987-2005),co-founder of Knowledge Bowl Kyle Rote, Jr., the son of Kyle Rote, hosted the show. WREG-TV meteorologist Jim Jaggers took Rote's place in 2006.  Prizes and Scholarships  According to the program's website, Knowledge Bowl and its sponsors have given away more than $3 million in college scholarships over 20 seasons, which is an average of $150,000 for each season. Scholarships are distributed in the following manner: * Minimum Prize: $200 Savings Bond * Advance to Second Round: $500 Scholarship To The University of Memphis * Advance to Third Round: $1000 Scholarship * Semifinalist: $1500 Scholarship * finalist: $3000 Scholarship * Champions: $7500 Scholarship In addition to scholarships, participants attend a banquet in their honor every year after taping is complete. The winning schools are honored with trophies and every participant is given a gift from WREG-TV and their sponsors.

The relation between the beach and its neighboring areas is complex. Although Yuigahama is legally the entire 3.2 km beach that goes from Inamuragasaki, which separates it from Shichirigahama, to Zaimokuza's Iijima cape, which separates it from Kotsubo and the Miura Peninsula, the name is customarily used to indicate the portion west of the Namerigawa river, while the eastern half is called .Kamakura's Official Textbook for Culture and Tourism (2008:33) This is the reason why, although the beach gives its name to only the west part of the beachside community, traces of the name Yuigahama can be found also in Zaimokuza (for example in Moto Hachiman's official name, Yui Wakamiya). The center of Yuigahama came legally into being between 1964 and 1965 and was named after the beach. Today's Yuigahama was until then divided between Zaimokuza, ≈åmachi, and Hase. There are different theories about the origin of the name. According to one it derives from an earlier one, . According to another it derives from the presence of a cooperative (). The name Yui itself has been written in various ways, among them Áî±‰∫ï and ÊπØ‰∫ï. History During the Kamakura period both the beach and the nearby areas were called .Nihon Rekishi Chimei Taikei, \\"Maehama\\" The name appears repeatedly in the Azuma Kagami to indicate spots going from Hase to Wakamiya ≈åji. It was used to practice martial arts such as (horseback archery) and yabusame (a horseback archery competition).Kusumoto (2002:48‚Äì49) It became a battlefield in 1180 at the time of the battle against Hatakeyama Shigetada, and again in 1333 for the fight between Nitta Yoshisada and the defense forces of the H≈çj≈ç. Lastly, it became a battleground in 1416 during Uesugi Zensh≈´'s rebellion. Human bones of the era are still occasionally found during excavations. It is on this beach that Nichiren, the founder of the Buddhist Nichiren sect, was put on a boat to be taken to Katase and ordered to be executed. The beach was considered sacred ground to the Minamoto clan and, before visiting shrines in Izu or Hakone, the sh≈çgun would always purify his body here. = Wakaejima = Wakae Island exposed by an exceptionally low tide During the Kamakura shogunate Sagami Bay was busy with trading ships, but its shallowness made indispensable the use of barges.Nihon Rekishi Chimei Taikei, \\"Wakaejma\\" Also, accidents between ships were common and it was therefore decided to build a port. A priest named applied for permission from the shogunate to build an artificial port in the area, permission granted in 1232. Much of the timber used to build Kamakura's best shrines passed through Miyakejima. In its first form, the harbor functioned as both a breakwater and a wharf, and was built with large stones laid as a foundation, with smaller stones on top. It was later extended gradually and repaired several times until the end of the Edo period, when it was abandoned.

SARS belongs to the class II amino-acyl tRNA family and is found in all humans; its encoded enzyme, seryl-tRNA synthetase, is involved in protein translation and is related to several bacterial and yeast counterparts. Mutations in SARS have been associated with several conditions, including HUPRA syndrome.  Discovery  Since the 1960s, seryl- tRNA synthetases have been described in various eukaryotic species, in both biochemical and structural analyses. It was not until 1997 that human SARS and its enzyme product were isolated and expressed in Escherichia coli by a team from The European Molecular Biology Laboratory in France.  Gene location  The human SARS gene is located on the plus strand of chromosome 1, from base pair 109,213,893 to base pair 109,238,182.UniProt:  Protein  Seryl-tRNA synthetase is made up of 514 amino acid residues as weighs 58,777 Da.\\"UnitProt\\" It exists as a homodimer of two identical subunits, with the tRNA molecule binding across the dimer by similarity. It has two distinct domains: * A catalytic core * A 3 base pair serine binding N-terminal extension  Function and mechanism  \\"SARS\\" and it‚Äôs enzyme product seryl- tRNA synthetase are involved in protein translation; specifically, seryl-tRNA synthetase catalyses the transfer of L-serine to tRNA (Ser). The cytosolic enzyme recognises its cognate tRNA species and binds with a high level of specificity, allowing the accurate interaction between corresponding codons and anticodons on mRNA and tRNA during protein translation.  Mutations  As with many mutations that affect protein translation, mutations in the SARS gene set have been shown to cause a collection of diseases, such as hyperuricemia, metabolic alkalosis, pulmonary hypertension, and progressive kidney failure in infancy; together, these conditions are known as HUPRA syndrome. In these cases, the SARS gene (in particular, \\"SARS2\\") undergoes a missense mutation, which results in a complete lack of acetylated seryl-tRNA synthetase and a severely reduced amount of non-acetylated enzyme. This results in the ineffective or complete inability of L-serine to be transferred to its cognate tRNA, resulting in incomplete protein translation and folding. The impacts appear to only reach a phenotypic pathology in certain high energy expenditure cells, such as renal cells and lung tissue. It has been suggested that the residual activity of the SARS2 gene allows most other tissues to avoid cytopathic symptoms, however, is unable to protect high-energy requirement cells from damage. The prevalence of SARS mutations resulting in HUPRA syndrome are incredibly rare, with less than 1 in 1,000,000 babies born with the condition.\\"Orpha\\" A Palestinian community in the Greater Jerusalem region appears to have a much higher incidence of the mutation, potentially due to a common ancestor.

Development was started in 1947 when J.W. York and R.A Bryan bought of undeveloped land two miles west of downtown Raleigh, near the North Carolina State University campus. The \\"village\\" was to consist of a shopping center, apartments, and single family homes.  History  The shopping center opened in 1949, and quickly became the premier shopping area in Raleigh. It is also considered the first shopping center to be built between Washington, D.C. and Atlanta. The shopping center is an open-air shopping mall, but unlike a strip mall, the stores are divided into blocks with some on two levels. Several parking decks were built in the 1960s, although most of these were removed in later renovations, to give a more open feel. Cameron Village grew quickly, and by 1950 the community had 65 stores, a movie theater, more than 600 homes and apartments, and over 100 business/professional offices. Downtown Raleigh, which had been the primary shopping location in the Raleigh area, started to see a decline in business as consumers gravitated toward the convenient parking of Cameron Village. The Occidental Life Insurance Company Building was added to Cameron Village in 1956. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.  Neighborhood Association  Residents of the single family homes, condominiums, and apartments in Cameron Village are represented by the Cameron Village Neighborhood Association. Meetings are held quarterly to discuss issues related to traffic, zoning, construction, and other matters.  Entertainment  In the 1970s, ‚ÄúThe Village Subway,‚Äù an underground area, formerly used as a bomb shelter in the Cold War, was converted into an entertainment and music venue that included shops and restaurants. It was located beneath the current The Fresh Market and the Cameron Village Regional Library. Nightclubs such as The Frog and Nightgown, The Pier, and Cafe D√©j√† Vu opened and attracted many regional and national upcoming performers as diverse as Muddy Waters and Barry Manilow. ‚ÄúThe Subway‚Äù existed for about 12 years; however; most establishments closed during the 1980s.  Currently  Renovated Cameron Village Regional Library The Fresh Market, Harris Teeter, Walgreens, Ann Taylor (clothing retailer), and a Wake County Public Library branch serve as anchors. The shopping center has been expanded and renovated several times, including a restyling in the mid-1980s and another in the early 2000s. Today, Cameron Village has over 100 stores including over a dozen restaurants like The Flying Biscuit Cafe, boutiques like Genealogy Formals, and the world's only two-story Chick-fil-A.

Previously known as Basic Transcription Element Binding Protein 1 (BTEB Protein 1), Klf9 is part of the Sp1 C2H2-type zinc finger family of transcription factors. Several previous studies showed Klf9-related regulation of animal development, including cell differentiation of B cells, keratinocytes, and neurons. Klf9 is also a key transcriptional regulator for uterine endometrial cell proliferation, adhesion, and differentiation, all factors that are essential during the process of pregnancy and are turned off during tumorigenesis.  Function  The protein encoded by this gene is a transcription factor that binds to GC box elements located in the promoter. Binding of the encoded protein to a single GC box inhibits mRNA expression while binding to tandemly repeated GC box elements activates transcription. Oxidative stress increases expression of Klf9 and overexpression of Klf9 gene sensitizes the cell to oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS)]. , Using a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to silence expression of Klf9 provides resistance for the cell to oxidative stress and ROS-related cell death. Klf9 is upregulated by ROS and promotes ROS-related cell death. Klf9 exhibits similarities to other known oxidative stress genes like NQO1 and HMOX1. When exposed to the same amount of hydrogen peroxide, both mouse embryo cells and human cells produced similar amounts of Klf9 and NQO1/HMOX. The opposite of this effect also occurs; Klf9 overexpression within the cell leads to an increase in intracellular ROS. The end result of the increase in intracellular ROS and Klf9 is increase in cell death; with the overexpressed Klf9 gene, more cells die. Similar cell death was found in vivo when wild-type mice were exposed to oxidative stress agent paraquat intranasally, which validated the oxidative stress-dependent Klf9 expression found in just the cell lines. Regions around 10 kb upstream and 1 kb downstream of Klf9 transcription start site contain conserved antioxidant response elements (AREs), which are binding sites for Nrf2. Nrf2 is a major regulator of the antioxidant response to ROS within the cell. Klf9 is upregulated by Nrf2; when oxidative stress is high and concentration of intracellular ROS is high, Nrf2 binds to Klf9 promoter, which increases the amount of intracellular ROS, leading to cell death. When oxidative stress is low, Nrf2 goes through its normal pathway by increasing the amount of antioxidant species within the cell and decreasing the amount of intracellular ROS.  Animal studies  A Klf9 deficiency suppresses bleomycin-induced fibrosis in the lungs of mice. By introducing bleomycin to lung tissue, the tissue will produce ROS and develop fibrotic lung tissue to combat the damage done by the bleomycin. When Klf9 was knocked out in these mice, not as much fibrotic lung tissue was formed. Because of this finding, the researchers proposed that manipulations of Klf9 levels within the body may be a valid treatment for other diseases as well, including certain types of cancer.  Interactions  KLF9 has been shown to interact with progesterone receptor.

Function  This gene encodes a selenoprotein, which contains a selenocysteine (Sec) residue at its active site. The selenocysteine is encoded by the UGA codon that normally signals translation termination. The 3' UTR of selenoprotein genes have a common stem-loop structure, the sec insertion sequence (SECIS), that is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon rather than as a stop signal. This protein shows highest expression in skeletal muscle and heart, and may be involved in oxidation-reduction reactions.

In many cases they serve as innovators and demonstrators of new methods of decentralized participatory decision-making, management, and accountability that may be adopted for broader application by public sector organizations.  Prevalence of social funds  In 2007 Social Funds existed in more than 45 countries, predominantly in poorer and smaller developing countries that receive significant official development assistance. However, a Social Fund also exists in Romania, a country that has recently joined the EU, as well as in many other Eastern European countries. Probably the largest Social Fund is the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF) with a resource base of US$ 500 million.World Bank on PPAF Social Funds have channeled close to US$ 5 billion of World Bank funding in Africa alone between 1999 and 2005 World Bank and have channeled more than ten billion dollars from all donors and governments' own resources over the past 20 years.WorldBank: Development Outreach  History and evolution  The first Social Fund was created in 1987 in Bolivia. During the 1990s Social Funds spread quickly throughout Latin America and Africa with the intellectual and financial backing of the World Bank and other donors. The first generation social funds were created to serve as short-term safety nets to soften the impact of structural adjustment policies on the poor, which was mainly achieved by providing temporary employment. Second generation social funds have adopted more explicit institutional strategies aimed at empowerment and capacity building of communities as well as local governments in the context of decentralization. Social Funds were created as temporary agencies that would be phased out once capacity of line agencies had been strengthened. Some Social Funds, such as in Ethiopia, are now in the process of being phased out, and others, such as in Honduras, are supposed to be closed down by law a few years from now. However, many Social Funds may well remain permanent institutions fulfilling important functions that line agencies may not be well set up to perform.  Benefits  Some of the benefits of Social Funds have been their ability to better reach poor constituencies, to reduce corruption and to introduce innovations. Social Funds have pioneered community-driven development (CDD), whereby community- based organizations (typically representing a few hundred people or less, often in rural areas) administrate funds themselves and choose where to invest them, thus increasing transparency and accountability for the use of funds. This approach also builds the self-confidence and capacity of local communities. It also helps projects to better meet local needs.  Criticism  Social Funds have been criticized for displacing or weakening existing institutions such as sectoral ministries and departments, particularly since they often - but not always - offer salaries that are significantly higher than in the public sector. Another criticism is that there has been no exit strategy to phase out Social Funds, although they were intended to be temporary institutions.  Evaluation  In 2002 the World Bank carried out the first systematic, cross-country evaluation of Social Funds.Social Fund Evaluation and Evaluation Summary The evaluation covered social funds in Armenia, Bolivia, Honduras, Nicaragua, Peru, and Zambia. Investments had been concentrated in education, health, water and sanitation sub-projects. Each evaluation reviewed the social fund‚Äôs poverty targeting, sustainability, welfare impacts, and costs. One of the evaluation's main conclusions was that the Social Funds evaluated were indeed effective at reaching the poor and extremely poor communities and households, something that had been disputed given allegedly limited capabilities of poor communities to manage funds and execute sub-projects.

The Australian version of Rolling Stone was initially published in 1970 as a supplement in Revolution magazine published by Monash University student Phillip Frazer. NOTE: This PDF is 282 pages. It was launched as a fully fledged magazine in 1972 by Frazer and was the longest surviving international edition of Rolling Stone until its last issue appeared in January 2018. As of February 2019, Rolling Stone Australia returned with a digital platform published by The Brag Media, in an exclusive licensing deal with Rolling Stone owner Penske Media Corporation. In June 2020, the magazine was acquired from the Bauer Media Group by Sydney-based investment firm Mercury Capital. History The Australian version of Rolling Stone launched in May 1970 as a supplement in Revolution, a counter-culture magazine edited and published by Phillip Frazer in Melbourne as an offshoot of his teen-based pop newspaper Go-Set. NOTE: On-line version is a 'snippet view' Go-Set introduced a counter-culture supplement called Core on 13 December 1969, edited by Ed Nimmervoll who had worked on Go-Set since 1966. Frazer soon decided that the \\"Core\\" material deserved a stand-alone publication for older readers, and on 1 May 1970, Go-Set Publications launched the tabloid Revolution, co-edited by Frazer and Jon Hawkes. From its fourth issue onward Revolution included a supplement of Rolling Stone pages under an agreement Frazer made with its Californian owner and publisher Jann Wenner. In August 1971 Revolution became High Times(before the US magazine of that name), which featured Australian underground cartoons curated by co-editors Pat Woolley and Macy McFarland. Frazer left Go-Set and High Times early in 1972 and, with his business partner Geoff Watson, launched the Australian Rolling Stone as a fully fledged magazine, five years after the flagship started in the United States. Rolling Stone Australia was published fortnightly, devoted to music, politics, and popular culture, with a few local articles supplementing the major features from the parent magazine. In August 1972 Frazer launched an Australian counter-culture magazine The Digger which was published fortnightly, then monthly, and it was The Digger, and not the local edition Rolling Stone, that fostered a team of star young writers like Colin Talbot, Helen Garner, Garrie Hutchinson and Robert Adamson, who rivalled the American Stone‚Äôs iconoclastic reputation for New Journalism. In 1975, before Frazer left Australia for the United States, he closed down The Digger and sold the local Stone licence to a group of journalists led by former Financial Review writer Paul Gardiner, with Jane Mathieson and Paul Comrie Thomson. One thing this meant, perhaps most crucially, was that the magazine moved base from Melbourne to Sydney. The first Australian act on the cover was Skyhooks in 1976, who reportedly hated the photo, but it did mark a broadening recognition of local acts in the magazine. Together Gardiner, Mathieson and Comrie- Thompson built Rolling Stone Australia up as a major player in terms of circulation, shifting about 35,000 copies each fortnight. The magazine, however, lacked consistent local content. The Skyhooks cover was the exception rather than the rule, and an Australian band would not re-appear on the cover again until Men at Work in 1983 ‚Äì and that was a relayed American story. The magazine also lacked the immediacy and the team of quality contributors that made its rival RAM so much more successful in terms of relevance and quality. Certainly in no way in this phase, in the late 70s, did it develop a cast of writers the way The Digger had only a few years earlier, with only Bruce Elder staying on for the long haul, and P.D. Jack coming and going. As the booms in local pub rock and punk rock started to take off, Rolling Stone seemed increasingly irrelevant, an imported acolyte of all things West Coast with precious little acknowledgement of the blossoming Australian scene around it. The real mark of the magazine's change came in 1980, when it shifted from a fortnightly to a monthly. As if overnight, the Silvertongues‚Äô brains-trust became so enamored of the new music explosion that Paul Gardiner added a sideline to the business, when he acquired the local licence on the UK labels Rough Trade and Factory Records, meaning that in addition to Rolling Stone the office was now putting out albums by Joy Division and Cabaret Voltaire, and Paul Comrie-Thompson became a sort of advisor if not manager to Chris Bailey and his band the Saints. At the same time, a handful of younger writers like the very young Ed St.John and occasional RAM contributors Toby Creswell and soon enough Clinton Walker too started freelancing for Rolling Stone and invigorating its pages. (The record label side of the business ended when erstwhile Art Director Andrew Penhallow left and took it with him, transforming it into GAP and finally Volition Records, which became very successful in the late 80s/90s with acts like Severed Heads.) The magazine shifted from its old office in North Sydney to the basement of the Gardiners‚Äô home in Neutral Bay, and even as it continued to tinker, in the mid-80s, with its format, experimenting with design styles, colour and paperstock ‚Äì and experimenting with a great many different contributors ‚Äì it was finally starting to look like a viable competitor to RAM. In 1985, Rolling Stone published The Big Australian Rock Book, a sort of A-Z survey of then- Australian music, edited by Ed St.John and written largely by he, Bruce Elder, Toby Creswell, Clinton Walker and Andrea Jones. The final transformation began in 1986, when Toby Creswell was made Editor. Ed St.John had by now left to become a record company executive, and Creswell was a journalist steeped in the Rolling Stone ethos and tradition but crucially also possessed of a certain vision for Australian music, and it was he who shaped the magazine into its most successful and very Australian form in the late 80s/early 90s. Naturally it still relied heavily on its American parent for content, but with Clinton Walker especially as a star contributor alongside the copy Creswell himself generated, the magazine was now brimming with well-written local features and news stories, and incisive reviews. In 1987, owners Paul Gardiner and Jane Maitheson pulled out of the business amid mounting debts and American indifference, and the licence to publish Rolling Stone in Australia was picked up by Creswell leading a consortium he‚Äôd assembled with an old school friend, Philip Keir, and Keir's wife Lesa-Belle Furhagen.https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/rolling-stone-still- rocking-35-years-on-20070424-gdpz6b.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 Shifting headquarters back to Sydney city, to Surry Hills right in the middle of a booming inner-city music circuit, and taking on staff that included most notably designer/writer David Messer, Rolling Stone was then left, after the demise of RAM in 1989, with the Australian music magazine market almost entirely to itself. In the face of competition only from the now-widespread, regionalised free street press with its preponderance of advertorial, and now with John O‚ÄôDonnell as Creswell‚Äôs Assistant Editor and going glossy full colour throughout, Rolling Stone entered its peak period, with its own flavor quite distinct from the American edition. In addition to relying on Clinton Walker for major features and acerbic reviews, Creswell nurtured new young writers like O‚ÄôDonnell and John Birmingham, who won Rolling Stone‚Äôs campus writing contest, and had it not been for its great weakness, its Sydney- centricity ‚Äì its inability to get good consistent coverage on the ground in Melbourne ‚Äì the magazine would undoubtedly have been Australia's journal of record for music culture. By the early 90s, however, with Next Media now having bought a building of its own in southern-Sydney suburb Redfern, tensions were brewing between Phil Keir and both his wife Lesa-Belle Furhagen and Toby Creswell. The eventual result was that September 1992, saw a traumatic split, in which Creswell was escorted off the premises by security,http://www.clintonwalker.com.au/lowest-of-the-low-6.html Keir took control of the company, and Creswell and Furhagen went off together to form Terraplane Press, which launched Juice magazine. Juice aimed itself, with the rise of grunge in the 90s, at a slightly younger demographic than Rolling Stone, but Stone, with Kathy Bail now installed as editor, continued to offer quality coverage of Australian and global music, politics, and popular culture. Freelancer Clinton Walker was the only writer to carry over from the old regime to this new one (while he also contributed to Juice at the same time!), and when Dino Scatena came in on staff to assist Bail, the magazine enjoyed a boost in stability and success, and certainly it would outlive Juice, which despite its efforts for a decade, went down when the dot.com bubble burst in 2003. Australian Rolling Stone celebrated its 25th year with a special collector's edition in May 1998, and at that time the publishers claimed the current circulation was around 40,000. After Bail and Scatena (and Clinton Walker) had left the magazine by the late 90s, it entered into something of a phase in the wilderness, with a succession of editors and owners compromising its content and integrity in the face of a shifting pop- cultural landscape, including not least of all the rise of the internet. In 2008 Next Media Pty Ltd was purchased by Worseley Media, in a deal that saw ACP Magazines acquire Rolling Stone magazine in exchange for ACP titles Tracks and Waves. A few months later, ACP relaunched Rolling Stone, with a new look and size. In 2008 the magazine averaged sales of 27,051 copies a month, down from 29,372 the year before and about 40,000 at the time of its 30th anniversary issue six years previous. Its average readership in March 2008 was 301,000, compared with 296,000 a year earlier; the readership had peaked in December 1994 at 392,000. ACP was acquired by Bauer Media Group in 2012 and in 2013, the company Paper Riot, headed by Matt Coyte, bought the Rolling Stone franchise from Bauer. Under Coyte's editorship, and with the launch of its own independent website in 2014, Stone started to claw back some of its former relevance and credibility, but it was an Indian Summer, and in January 2018, Paper Riot went into external administration and the last-ever issue of Australian Rolling Stone appeared. In January 2019 it was announced that Rolling Stone would be returning to the Australian market. Rolling Stone magazine returns to Australia In mid-June 2020, Sydney-based investment firm Mercury Capital acquired Rolling Stone from Bauer Media.

Reevaluation of generic concepts. International Journal of Plant Sciences 164: 43-51. The name is from Greek Œ¥Œ≠ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøŒΩ (\\"tree\\") and œÜœçŒªŒ±Œæ (\\"guard; keeper\\"). One species, Dendrophylax lindenii, featured heavily in the book The Orchid Thief.  Biology  The plants of this genus are unusual in that they consist of masses of photosynthetic roots anchored in trees with a highly reduced stem and ephemeral leaves which have been reduced to scales. The bulk of these plants consists only of flat, cord-like, green roots with distinctive \\"track marks\\". These white track marks are called pneumatodes and function in much the same manner as stomata allowing the photosynthetic roots to perform gas exchange to support photosynthesis. = Phylogeny = Members of this genus are distant relatives of the African and Indian Ocean genus Angraecum; it seems that orchid seed, blowing like dust, crossed the Atlantic at least once and successfully colonized new habitat. Current evidence derived from molecular studies indicates that the original arrival from Africa which spawned this genus and the related genus Harriselia was a member of the subtribe Angraecineae with small leaves and flowers and a monopodial growth habit, and the leafless habit developed in parallel in both Africa and the Caribbean, since the genes are present in all members of the subtribe Angraecineae and the leafless habit is common in several genera within the Vandeae (Chilochista, Dendrophylax, Harriselia, and Microcoelia). = Cultivation = Several species such as Dendrophylax funalis, Dendrophylax fawcetti, and Dendrophylax lindenii produce large, showy, white flowers which are highly fragrant and described as smelling fruity and reminiscent of an apple. Most members of this genus are pollinated by various species of moths with very long probosces and the flowers of most species within this genus possess very long nectar spurs ranging from 4 to 8 inches in length on average.

In mathematics, he is noted for authoring a series of publications as a University of Virginia professor. Biography He was born at Longwood House in Farmville, Virginia and graduated from Hampden- Sydney College, founded by his Patriot ancestor Nathaniel Venable, at the age of 15. He was a member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity while at Hampden-Sydney College. For several years following his graduation, he served as a mathematics tutor at the college. He received further education at the University of Virginia as well as in Berlin and Bonn, Germany. He became a professor in mathematics and astronomy in Virginia and South Carolina. Venable was present at the firing on Fort Sumter in April 1861, serving as a lieutenant in the South Carolina state militia. He then fought as a private in Company A, 2nd South Carolina Infantry. In the spring of 1862, Venable joined the staff of presidential military advisor General Robert E. Lee as an aide- de-camp with the rank of major. He continued serving on Lee's staff when the general took command of the Army of Northern Virginia on June 1, 1862. He served on Lee's staff from the Peninsula Campaign to Appomattox Court House and was promoted to lieutenant colonel. According to family legend (and some history books) Lee called Venable \\"Faithful old Venable.\\" Following the war, Venable resumed his career as an educator.

The various islands make up another 5500 km of coastline, resulting in a total of almost 11,000 km.Geoscience Australia: Border Lengths - States and Territories. Accessed 6 March 2016. The southern part of the Territory (Central Australia) is extremely arid. Alice Springs and the surrounding communities make the total population of Central Australia around 60,000 people. There are also large Cattle Stations and significant areas protected around the area. Major transportation in Central Australia mainly comes from road and rail. There are many very small settlements scattered across the Territory but the larger population centres are located on the single sealed road that links Darwin to southern Australia, the Stuart Highway, known to locals simply as \\"the track\\". Geographical features The coastline in the Top End includes three of Australia's largest islands, Groote Eylandt, Bathurst Island and the largest, Melville Island. The highest point in the Territory is Mount Zeil at 1,531 metres (5021.68 ft) and is situated in the MacDonnell Ranges. In the northern part of the territory lies Kakadu National Park, that features wetlands and native wildlife. To the north of that is the Arafura Sea, and to the east Arnhem Land, whose regional centre is Maningrida on the Liverpool River delta. Much of the Territory is relatively flat, but has some disconnected ranges, including the sandstone plateau of western Arnhem Land. Long mountain ranges are more a feature of Central Australia, these include the MacDonnell Ranges, the Petermann Ranges, and Harts Range. The Northern Territory also has the natural rock formations of Uluru and Kata Tjuta, which are sacred to the local Aboriginal people.

Description Orchids in the genus Chiloschista are epiphytic or lithophytic, usually leafless Monopodial herbs with flat, green, photosynthetic roots radiating from a short, central rhizome. The flowers are arranged on long, thin flowering stems, open sporadically in groups and only last for a few hours to one or two days. They are small and resupinate, with the sepals and petals more or less similar in size and shape to each other but different from the labellum which has three lobes. The side lobes of the labellum are erect and larger than the middle lobe which is slipper-shaped. Taxonomy and naming The genus Chiloschista was first described in 1832 by John Lindley in Edwards's Botanical Register.

Function  Characterized domaines of PALB2 ATM (ATM) is a protein kinase that is recruited and activated by DNA double-strand breaks. DNA double-strand damages also activate the Fanconi anemia core complex (FANCA/B/C/E/F/G/L/M). The FA core complex monoubiquitinates the downstream targets FANCD2 and FANCI. ATM activates (phosphorylates) CHEK2 and FANCD2 CHEK2 phosphorylates BRCA1. Ubiquinated FANCD2 complexes with BRCA1 and RAD51. The PALB2 protein acts as a hub, bringing together BRCA1, BRCA2 and RAD51 at the site of a DNA double-strand break, and also binds to RAD51C, a member of the RAD51 paralog complex RAD51B-RAD51C-RAD51D-XRCC2 (BCDX2). The BCDX2 complex is responsible for RAD51 recruitment or stabilization at damage sites. RAD51 plays a major role in homologous recombinational repair of DNA during double strand break repair. In this process, an ATP dependent DNA strand exchange takes place in which a single strand invades base-paired strands of homologous DNA molecules. RAD51 is involved in the search for homology and strand pairing stages of the process. This gene encodes a protein that functions in genome maintenance (double strand break repair). This protein binds to and colocalizes with the breast cancer 2 early onset protein (BRCA2) in nuclear foci and likely permits the stable intranuclear localization and accumulation of BRCA2. PALB2 binds the single strand DNA and directly interacts with the recombinase RAD51 to stimulate strand invasion, a vital step of homologous recombination, PALB2 can function synergistically with a BRCA2 chimera (termed piccolo, or piBRCA2) to further promote strand invasion.  Clinical significance  Variants in the PALB2 gene are associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer of magnitude similar to that associated with BRCA2 mutations and PALB2-deficient cells are sensitive to PARP inhibitors. PALB2 was recently identified as a susceptibility gene for familial pancreatic cancer by scientists at the Sol Goldman Pancreatic Cancer Research Center at Johns Hopkins. This has paved for the way for developing a new gene test for families where pancreatic cancer occurs in multiple family members. Tests for PALB2 have been developed by Ambry Genetics and Myriad Genetics that are now available. The PALB2 Interest Group (PALB2.org) is an international consortium of scientists and clinicians who coordinate research into this gene. They are keen to hear from women and men with PALB2 mutations. Prophylactic mastectomy should be considered for women that had breast cancer and a PALB2 mutation. Biallelic mutations in PALB2 (also known as FANCN), similar to biallelic BRCA2 mutations, cause Fanconi anemia. Mutations in this gene have been associated with an increased risk of ovarian, breast and pancreatic cancer. Meiosis PALB2 mutant male mice have reduced fertility. This reduced fertility appears to be due to germ cell attrition resulting from a combination of unrepaired DNA breaks during meiosis and defective synapsis of the X and Y chromosomes. The function of homologous recombination during meiosis appears to be repair of DNA damages, particularly double-strand breaks (also see Origin and function of meiosis). The PALB2-BRCA1 interaction is likely important for repairing such damages during male meiosis.

Kordell Stewart started by rushing 9 yards for a touchdown, then Rashaan Salaam scored two 1-yard touchdown runs to increase the lead to 31‚Äì3. Ron Powlus threw a 9-yard touchdown pass to Derrick Mayes to cut the lead to 31‚Äì10 before halftime. 2nd half Powlus threw a 40-yard touchdown pass to Mayes to cut the lead to 31‚Äì17, early in the third quarter. Then Voskeritchian kicked a 48-yard field goal to extend Colorado's lead to 34‚Äì17. Rashaan Salaam put the exclamation mark on the game with a 5-yard touchdown run, increasing Colorado's lead to 41‚Äì17. Notre Dame scored one last time on a 7-yard pass from Powlus to Leon Wallace to provide the final margin.

The Festival is set in a fictional storybook village of \\"Fairhaven\\" and nestled within 375 acres of autumn woodlands. The open air village and artisan marketplace is complete with cottages and bungalows of 16th century European architecture. Inside the village gates are over 140 merchants, crafters, and artisans working to create, demonstrate, and sell quality handmade wares of all types and mediums. 14 outdoor stages burst to life with non-stop theater, comedy, music, dance, magic, circus entertainments, swimming mermaids, and live falconry demonstrations. Hundreds of costumed villagers and fantasy characters roam the lanes offering additional interactive entertainment. The Festival's premier attraction features knights on horseback jousting three times daily inside the Queen's tournament arena. Attendees can choose to shop, play, sit back and enjoy the shows, or partake in n array of country fair games, unique people- powered rides, and feasting fit for Royal appetites. The Festival is held annually on Saturdays and Sundays in October and November and three consecutive week dates in October as a field trip destination for area schools. The Festival is located just north of Charlotte, North Carolina between the towns of Huntersville and Concord near the intersection of 73 and Poplar Tent Road and with equal distance access to I-77 and I-85. An average of 195,000 visitors time travel to the Festival during its fall season. Attractions Stage shows feature live music, dance, comedy shows, and performers with circus variety skills such as juggling, aerial silks, acrobatics, and sideshow antics. Musicians perform with traditional instruments such as the harp, bagpipes, or other, more obscure, \\"period\\" instruments. Roaming the \\"lanes\\" of the festival are a variety of nationally traveling professional street performers who engage visitors to help create an interactive performance experience. In addition to 14 stages of non-stop entertainments, there are three premier attractions: 1) Jousting Knights on Horseback: Thrice daily stunt riders on horseback charge at each other with lances in full tilt. The jousts are performed by Aventail Productions and the competition is scored with historically accuracy with points and victory awarded to the true winners of each competition. The last joust of the day ends with a conflict settled by a ground fight to the \\"death\\". 2) The Ancient Art of Falconry is presented four times daily at the Edgewood Theatre. Watch as a variety of birds-of-prey display the unique skills that enraptured nobles long ago and made falconry the sport of kings. Children and adults alike are amazed by these beautiful creatures in flight. 3) The \\"Sea Fairies\\" Mermaid exhibit feature mermaid models swimming in a 3,000 gallon aquarium tank. Accompanying the tank is always a Mermaid sitting on a throne taking photos with children. The Carolina Renaissance Festival also operates an in-house performance company featuring over 100 costumed characters who also interact directly with visitors at the fair, in an attempt to create a more authentic feel of a renaissance-era town and to help bring the \\"village\\" to life. Individuals in the company develop characters such as \\"The Village Baker,\\" \\"Tavern Keeper,\\" etc. A \\"Singing Milkmaid\\" trio, a Town Mayor, and the fictional Royal Family that has come to visit the shire are other examples. The company is primarily composed of people from surrounding communities, including Concord, Greensboro, Raleigh and Charlotte. Auditions are held June of each year. Activities Over 140 vendors sell a variety of handmade arts and craft goods such as handmade jewelry, artisan leather goods, blown glass made at live demonstrations, candles, and custom chain mail. The festival vends an assortment of medieval themed foods, including giant turkey legs, various soups, stews, and chowders served in \\"bread bowls\\", \\"Steak on a Stake\\", fish and chips, corn on the cob, and Scotch eggs. Alongside the shops one can find games such as archery target-shooting, crossbow shooting, axe throwing, frog catapults and a gold coin hunt. Weddings and vow renewal ceremonies are also held on site, with ceremonies attended by the cast of the Royal Court and a covered pavilion reserved for the couple. In addition to the above, the festival has several mini-themed weekends throughout the course of the season such as the popular \\"Time Travelers Weekend\\" where costume players of all genres (science fiction, comic books, etc.) are invited to time travel to the renaissance. Other themes include BrewFest Weekend, Halloween Daze & Spooky Knights Weekend, and Pirate's Christmas Weekend. Opening Weekend is always celebrated with a buy one, get one free discount for adult admission (coupon required). History The Carolina Renaissance Festival was introduced in 1994 by Jeff Siegel, owner of parent company Royal Faires which also owns and operates the Arizona Renaissance Festival. There'll be no festival planned in 2020. The 27th will be deferred to 2021.

This gene was identified based on its homology to the gene encoding the RING3 (BRD2) protein, a serine/threonine kinase. The gene localizes to 9q34, a region which contains several major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes.  Structure  BRD3 is a member of the Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal motif (BET) protein family. Like other BET family members it contains two tandem homologous bromodomains and an \\"Extra-Terminal\\" motif. BRD3, similar to BRD2, does not have a long C-terminal domain as BET family proteins BRD4 and BRDT do.  Function  Like other BET protein family members, BRD3 associates with acetylated lysine residues on histones and transcription factors. BRD3 has been implicated in nucleosome remodeling in the context of transcription. BRD2 and BRD3 perform overlapping cellular functions.  Clinical significance  Chromosomal translocation of BRD3 with the NUT gene has been implicated in NUT midline carcinoma. BRD3-NUT driven cancers are histopathologically indistinguishable from BRD4-NUT driven cancers, likely because these translocations involve the N-terminal portion bromodomain-containing portion of these proteins which are highly conserved. Depletion of BRD3 slows growth in cancer models including prostate cancer and medulloblastoma. The effect of BRD3 depletion is milder than that of other BET proteins BRD2 and BRD4 when each is tested in isolation. BET inhibitors target highly conserved BET bromodomains and displace BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4 from chromatin simultaneously. Functional redundancy between BRD2 and BRD3 suggests that their simultaneous disruption of these proteins may be more important than is appreciated by depletion of these proteins individually.

He was the son of Mas'ud Shihna. Biography In the early 1380s Shah-i Shahan was sent by the malik Qutb al-Din as an hostage to the camp of Timur. He was sent with tribute to establish the malik's submission to Timur. Upon his arrival, he apparently made a good impression on Timur and was soon allowed to return to Sistan. In 1383 Timur invaded Sistan, surrounded Shahr-i Sistan and imprisoned Qutb al-Din. Remembering his meeting with Shah-i Shahan a few years before, he decided to appoint the latter governor of Sistan on the condition that he would convince the defenders of the citadel of Shah-i Shahan (which had not yet fallen) to surrender. Shah-i Shahan agreed and the defenders soon ended their resistance, but instead of being spared like Timur had promised, the city was subjected to a three-day massacre. Shahr-i Sistan was plundered and its notables deported, before the army burned the city. Timur's army proceeded to ravage the rest of Sistan, except for Shah-i Shahan's estates. It then destroyed the fortress of Taq and several dams and irrigation canals before making its way to Bust and ravaging it, which led to the abandonment of the old city (the location of which is marked by Qala-e-Bost). Shah-i Shahan therefore had become the governor of an extremely devastated Sistan. He cleared Shahr-i Sistan of corpses and allowed the surviving people of the rural portions of the province to resettle on his own undamaged estates. In the meantime, the governorship of Isfizar had been given to two other Mihrabanids, Shah Giyath al-Din ibn Shah Abu'l-Fath and Shah Jalal al-Din; a year after Shah-i Shahan's coming to power they invaded Sistan and attempted to take control of the province. Shah-i Shahan appealed to Timur for help; he sent an army which forced the rival Mihrabanids out of Sistan. While in Sistan Shah-i Shahan continued to restore the province, rebuilding some of the dams and irrigation canals that had been destroyed by Timur's army. He also arranged a series of marriage alliances with the line of Muhammad ibn Nusrat al-Din Muhammad, which was the only other surviving line of the Mirhabanids. Shah-i Shahan spent a significant amount of time accompanying Timur on the latter's campaigns. He participated in the capture of Aleppo in 1400 and was present during Timur's campaign against the Ottoman Turks. While away from Sistan, Shah-i Shahan would have his brother-in-law Shams al-Din Shah 'Ali govern in his stead; when Shams al-Din Shah 'Ali died his son Qutb al-Din Muhammad was given that responsibility. In 1403, while on the return trip after the Ottoman campaign, Shah-i Shahan died. Qutb al-Din Muhammad, who had also participated in the campaign against the Ottomans, was then appointed as the malik's successor by Timur. References *Bosworth, C.E.

Due to his death soon after his appointment, the Confederate Senate never confirmed Godwin's promotion to the grade of brigadier general. Early life Archibald C. Godwin was born in Nansemond County, Virginia, in 1831, the son of Jonathan Lewis and Julia Campbell Godwin, a daughter of General Archibald Campbell, who was administering U.S. Public Lands of Missouri and the Northwest Territory in 1837.Godwin, Archibald Campbell. In Dictionary of North Carolina Biography, 6 volumes, edited by William S. Powell, Volume 2 D-G, Chapel Hill, N.C.: The University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill, 1979-1996. Before his first birthday, he was moved to Portsmouth, Virginia, to live with his grandmother Julia Hatton Godwin.Gen. Archibald Campbell Godwin, Confederate Veteran, Volume 28, p. 133-135. He was raised and educated in Portsmouth. Around the age of nineteen he went to California hoping to strike it rich during the California Gold Rush.Tucker, Spencer, James R. Arnold, Roberta Wiener, Paul G. Pierpaoli, and David Coffey. American Civil War: The Definitive Encyclopedia and Document Collection. Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2013. Life in California Godwin was able to build wealth on cattle, timber, real estate and mining in Northern California. In 1854, he was residing at Godwin's Place west of the Russian River in the Sonoma County, present-day Geyserville. He owned 640 acres of nearby land and was engaged in mercantile and livestock business. Since approximately 150 Native Americans lived on the Russian River, the Federal government appointed the 6'6\\" Godwin as an Indian agent, and Charles F. Winslow after visiting the area wrote that they were \\"under Mr. Godwin's complete control.\\"Pelanconi, Joe. A Character of the Time: Archibald Campbell Godwin. In Quicksilver Mining in Sonoma County: Pine Flat Prospect Fever. Charleston, S.C.: The History Press, 2014, pp. 12-17. There were hot springs on the property which later became known as The Geysers, and Godwin built The Geysers Resort Hotel to encourage visitors.A Geysers Album: Five eras of Geothermal History, California Department of Conservation Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources, Sacramento, 2010, p. 7. He discovered that his land possessed rich cinnabar ore deposits and in 1859 filed mining claims, which he had to defend in court as others disputed his right to mine quicksilver. Godwin obtained a legal license after passing exams and successfully represented himself in court in Santa Rosa. He became involved in local politics, and was elected a Justice of the Peace in 1855. He served on the Board of Directors of the Geyser Road committee. There are accounts that in 1860 Godwin lost the Democratic Party nomination for governor of California by one vote that are not confirmed by documents. After Virginia seceded from the Union, Godwin placed an advertisement in Petaluma Journal looking for a renter of his business interests in The Geysers, and turned his other property holdings to friends. Civil War=Provost's duties= Godwin returned to his native state when the American Civil War broke out in 1861. He initially served as a captain and then major in the provost's department and was assistant provost marshal in charge of Libby Prison. Later Jefferson Davis assigned to him the task of running the prison stockade in Salisbury, North Carolina, for anticipated Union prisoners. Godwin, who became the second prison commandant,Salisbury Prison, The American Civil War had acquired a reputation for being quite cruel to Union captives. There had been some discussion after the war of prosecuting Godwin until it was discovered that he was already dead.Sifakis, Stuart. Who Was Who in the Confederacy. Facts on File, 1989. Major John Henry Gee, one of nine commandants of Salisbury Prison Camp, was put on trial in 1866 in Raleigh on the charges of cruelty and conspiracy regarding his management of the prison but was acquitted on all charges.Sharing Their Stories (Salisbury Prisoner Of War Camp) =In the front line= Godwin was transferred to the front lines taking the colonelcy of the 57th North Carolina Infantry on July 17, 1862. His first action came at the Battle of Fredericksburg on December 13, 1862. He also served as a member of Robert F. Hoke's Brigade during the Fredericksburg phase of the Chancellorsville Campaign. Hoke had been wounded and was replaced by Colonel Isaac E. Avery. Godwin marched under the command of Avery to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, in the summer of 1863 participating in the attack on Cemetery Hill on July 2 at the Battle of Gettysburg. With the mortal wounding of Colonel Avery, Godwin temporarily assumed command of the brigade and led it back into Virginia and until November 7, 1863, when he was captured at Rappahannock Bridge. He was exchanged in 1864, and promoted on August 5 to brigadier general commanding what had formerly been Hoke's Brigade in Major General Stephen D. Ramseur's division. On the other hand, the Eichers state that Godwin's appointment was not confirmed by the Confederate Senate and therefore his promotion did not become legally effective.Eicher, John H., and David J.

The loch is also known as Loch Ceander and Loch Cannor. It is approximately in length and was formed from a glacial kettle hole. The loch sits within the Muir of Dinnet National Nature Reserve and is immediately south of Loch Davan. It contains several islets, as noted in a 19th-century book giving a brief description of the loch, and is forested with birch trees. Flora and fauna Due to its shallowness, light penetrates to the loch floor. Consequently, many species of aquatic plants exist including water lobelia, quillwort and shoreweed. In the summer white water lilies bloom on the loch. Around the perimeter reeds, sedges, horsetails, bulrushes and willow scrub are found and a beechwood forest fringes the edge. The loch is also home to pike, otters, goldeneye ducks, migrating geese and other wildfowl. Archaeology and history An Iron Age crannog was built on the loch, probably for defensive purposes. Oak tree trunks were driven into the loch bed and stones built up around them. A hut was then built on top of the structure. One of the remaining crannogs can be seen as a small island covered with trees. On the north shore stands a 9th- century, cross slab Pictish stone. It is carved with intricate knot work and indicates that there may have been a small monastery or chapel located nearby. At some point in history, the cross was lost and buried; however it was dug up again in the 1820s and erected at Aboyne Castle. In 1959 it was returned to its current location. During the period when the Romans were in Britain (80 - 399 CE) a fort was built on the southern promontory in response to rumours of a Roman invasion. The castle, which used to stand on one of the islets, was first known to have been recorded as a refuge for the Earl of Atholl after the Battle of Culblean in 1335.Simpson, W D (1929a) 'The early castles of Mar', Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, Vol. 63. There have been archaeological finds at the loch including a medieval bronze jug. A history of the loch was published by the Reverend John Grant Michie in 1877 and has been reprinted on at least two occasions.Michie, J G, 'The History of Loch Kinnord', David Douglas, Edinburgh, 1877. Recreation There is a circular walking route around the loch with vantage points for bird watching and wildlife spotting. The starting point for the walk is Burn O'Vat car park on the Ballater to Aboyne road. Since 2009 the Kinord Hall Committee has organised a 10 kilometre run around the loch. The first race was held on Saturday 24 October 2009.

It allowed the steamboats of the Columbia River to bypass the Cascades Rapids, and thereby opened a passage from the lower parts of the river as far as The Dalles. The locks were submerged and rendered obsolete in 1938, when the Bonneville Dam was constructed, along with a new set of locks, a short way downstream.Columbia River History, Northwest Power and Conservation Council. Accessed January 11, 2008. Design and construction Sunset over the eastern lock entrance, now flooded As rail competition grew, and forced steamboats off their old routes, shippers and steamboat lines began agitating Congress to allocate funds for improvements to the river, in the form of canals and locks, that would restore their competitive position relative to the railroads. The two main improvements sought on the Columbia were the Cascade Locks and, about twenty years later, the Celilo Canal and Locks. Studies for a canal at the Cascades had begun in 1875, but interest tapered off when Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company (O.R.& N.) finished the railroad to The Dalles and took its boats off the middle river. Anti-monopoly shippers eventually got Congress to allocate funds in 1893 to begin the canal and locks at the Cascades, which were completed in November 1896. The locks had a lift chamber carved in solid rock long, and 90' wide, with of draft, deep enough for any vessel then on the river, and large enough to accommodate several at once. The locks could raise a vessel 14' at high water and 24' at low water.Newell, Gordon R., ed., H.W. McCurdy Marine History of the Pacific Northwest, at page 5, Superior Publishing, Seattle, WA 1966 The lock gates were wide and high. The locks were carefully designed to address the great variation in the height of the river, the difference between high and low water being . This condition made it necessary to build a series of three sets of gates, increasing in height from the lower entrance to the huge upper guard gate, only two sets being used at one time. When the river was low, the upper guard gates remained open continually and the lower sets were operated. When the water rose enough to drown the lower gates, they were swung open and the lifting work was done by the others. The upper approach was formed by masonry wall extending from the guard gate in a long sweep of , and the bank behind was armored against floods with riprapped stone. \\"Cascade Locks,\\" Scientific American, page 167, March 13, 1897 Image:Cascade Locks, looking east, circa 1897.jpgCascade Locks, circa 1897, looking east, locks are functioning but bank work is still ongoing Image:Cascade Locks, looking south over lower lock, circa 1897.jpgCascade Locks, circa 1897, looking south and downriver across lower lock Image:Cascade Locks, looking south and east, circa 1897.jpgCascade Locks, circa 1897, looking south, showing middle lock and lockmaster and engineer buildings on embankment on south side Effect on river traffic Bailey Gatzert in Cascade Locks, circa 1915, with Columbia River in background In an 1897 article written shortly after their completion, Scientific American was optimistic about the future of the locks, saying: As it turns out, completion of the locks and the canal leading from the east end of the locks, produced some increase in traffic,McCurdy, at 5 but not as much increase in riverine traffic as had been hoped. The North Bank railroad was also completed along the Columbia, which took more business away from the boats. As a result, the Regulator Line, which had been running Dalles City, Regulator, and Bailey Gatzert on the lower Columbia, and, through the locks, on the middle Columbia, sold out to James J. Hill, owner of the Great Northern and other railroads. Not long later, in 1912, the Panama Canal Act made it illegal for a railroad to be owned in common with a competing steamboat line, so in 1915, Great Northern sold its boats.Timmen, Fritz, Blow for the Landing, at page 32-36, Caxton Printers, Caldwell, ID, 1972 Current status Dipnet fishing platforms on the canal The lower lock and the canal were flooded when the Bonneville Dam was completed in the 1930s.

Function  This gene encodes a member of the F-box protein family which is characterized by an approximately 40 amino acid motif, the F-box. The F-box proteins constitute one of the four subunits of ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCFs (SKP1-cullin-F-box), which function in phosphorylation- dependent ubiquitination. The F-box proteins are divided into 3 classes: Fbws containing WD-40 domains, Fbls containing leucine-rich repeats, and Fbxs containing either different protein-protein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the Fbxs class. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified for this gene. FBXO11 is conserved from nematodes to mammals, and both human FBXO11 and its worm ortholog (DRE-1) form functional SCF ubiquitin ligase complexes. By binding to and mediating the degradation of its substrate proteins, FBXO11 plays important roles in regulating cell cycle regulation, tumorigenesis, and tumor cell metastasis. Well established targets of FBXO11 include BCL6,, CDT1, and Snail.  Clinical significance  Inactivation of FBXO11-mediated BCL6 degradation has been shown to contribute to abnormal germinal-center formation and tumorigenesis. The Caenorhabditis elegans DRE-1/FBXO11 was reported to target the conserved transcription factor BLMP-1 for proteasomal degradation, and thereby regulates developmental timing and maturation.Dev Cell. 2014 Mar 31;28(6):697-710. doi: 10.1016/j.devcel.2014.01.028.

The gene encoding FBXO11 was found to be deleted or mutated in multiple diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines, and this inactivation of FBXO11 contributes to increased levels BCL6 and subsequently DLBCL pathogenesis. FBXO11 mutations were also identified in other human cancers, such as colon, lung, ovary, and head and neck tumors. In mice, a homozygous mutation of FBXO11 results in cleft palate defects, facial clefting, and perinatal lethality.

One of the last European-born leaders of American Reform Jewry, he served as president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (UAHC) for 23 years.Albert Vorspan, Schindler's Legacy , Reform Judaism Magazine (1996). Early life, military career, and education Schindler was born on October 4, 1925, in Munich, Germany, to Sali and Eliezer Schindler. His father was a Yiddish poet of note, his mother a businesswoman. He and his family fled the Nazis, first to Switzerland and then to America; Schindler arrived in the United States when he was twelve years old. The family settled in Washington Heights, Manhattan. Schindler studied engineering until the outbreak of World War II, when he joined the U.S. Army's 10th Mountain Division Alpine Ski Patrol in Europe as a corporal. He later served as a forward observer for Army artillery.Alexander Schindler, Encyclopedia of World Biography (Gale Group Inc. 2004). He was decorated with three combat ribbons for bravery and earned a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star for action in the Apennines of Italy. At the end of the war, he traveled from the Yugoslav border into Germany and was motivated to take up social issues after seeing Jews emerge from the Dachau concentration camp. When Schindler returned to the United States after the war, he studied at the City College of New York, graduating in 1949. He also was engaged in the Jewish Theological Seminary, Hebrew Union College (the American Reform movement's seminary) and the New School. In 1953, Schindler graduated from the Hebrew Union College's Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati, Ohio, with a master's degree in Hebrew letters. He was ordained as a rabbi the same year. Rabbinical career and leadership of the UAHC Schindler's first posting was at Temple Emanuel in Worcester, Massachusetts (coincidentally, the same congregation that produced his successor at the UAHC, Eric Yoffie), where he served as Assistant Rabbi and later Associate Rabbi from 1953 to 1959.Feingold, Norma and Sadick, Nancy. Temple Emanuel 1921-1996 75th Anniversary. Published by Temple Emanuel, 280 May Street, Worcester, Mass. 1996. He married Rhea Rosenblum on September 29, 1956. In 1959, Schindler moved to Boston and established the New England Coalition of Reform Synagogues. Later, Schindler moved to New York and was appointed director of the New England regional office of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (later renamed the Union for Reform Judaism). Schindler became the UAHC's national director of education by 1963 and its vice president by 1967. In 1973, Schindler became president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations from 1973; he remained in that position until his retirement in 1996. His best known, and most controversial pronouncements were his call for Jews to accept patrilineal descent (recognizing the children of Jewish fathers as Jewish). During his term, Schindler also \\"prodded the Reform Movement to participate fully in the Zionist world.\\"History: Rabbi Alexander M. Schindler, Union for Reform Judaism. His efforts are credited with the creation of the Association of Reform Zionists of America. He served as chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations in the late 1970s. For his work on the peace process in Israel, he received the Solomon Bublick Award of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1995, the book The Jewish Condition: Essays on Contemporary Judaism Honoring Rabbi Alexander M. Schindler, a collection of essays edited by Schindler and Aron Hirt-Manheimer, was published. The book contained, among other pieces, Reform Rabbi Margaret Wenig's essay \\"Truly Welcoming Lesbian and Gay Jews\\"--the first published argument to the Jewish community on behalf of civil marriage for gay couples. Schindler died at his home in Westport, Connecticut, on November 15, 2000, from a coronary arrest. At the time of his death he was president of the Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture and vice president of the World Jewish Congress.

The competing teams were the Alabama Crimson Tide, representing the Southeastern Conference (SEC), and the Louisville Cardinals, competing as a football independent. In what was the 20th anniversary of the Fiesta Bowl, Louisville won the game 34‚Äì7. Teams=Alabama= Under new coach Gene Stallings, Alabama's secondary coach under Bear Bryant from 1958‚Äì64, the 1990 Alabama squad opened the season ranked No. 13 only to be upset by Southern Miss, led by quarterback Brett Favre, in the opening game en route to an 0‚Äì3 start. The Crimson Tide also lost to Florida and Georgia during the skid. The Tide recovered to win six of their next seven, losing only to Penn State in the final meeting between the schools for 20 years. Following its 24‚Äì3 victory over LSU, Alabama accepted a bid to the Fiesta Bowl. Alabama concluded the regular season with a victory in the Iron Bowl vs. Auburn, giving it a final regular season record of 7‚Äì4. The appearance marked the first for Alabama in the Fiesta Bowl. Stallings, who was fired by the National Football League's Phoenix Cardinals with five games remaining in the 1989 season, coached in college for the first time since leading Texas A&M; in 1971. =Louisville= The Cardinals, known mostly for their basketball prowess under Denny Crum, enjoyed their finest football season to date under Kentucky native Howard Schnellenberger, who was an assistant under Bryant with Stallings before the latter was named head coach at Texas A&M; in 1965. Game summary Cardinals quarterback Browning Nagle started the scoring with a 70-yard touchdown pass to Latrell Ware to give Louisville an early 7‚Äì0 lead. Running back Ralph Dawkins scored next on a 5-yard touchdown run to increase Louisville's lead to 13‚Äì0. Nagle later threw a 37-yard touchdown pass to Anthony Cummings giving the Cards a 19‚Äì0 lead after the 2-point conversion attempt failed. Alabama's next possession resulted in a blocked punt, which Louisville recovered in the end zone for a touchdown. Another failed 2-point conversion kept the lead at 25‚Äì0, a huge lead Louisville raced to after one quarter. In the second quarter, Louisville had the ball again, before backup quarterback Jeff Brohm threw an interception, that was returned 49 yards for an Alabama touchdown. The interception returned for a touchdown cut the lead to 25‚Äì7, but those would be the only points Alabama would score the entire game. Louisville's defense shut down the Alabama offense. In the third quarter, Nagle threw a 19-yard touchdown pass to Anthony Cummings to give Louisville a 32‚Äì7 lead. Louisville's last points came in the fourth quarter on a safety, when Alabama's quarterback was called for intentional grounding in the end zone. Controversy The game was marred by the controversy surrounding Arizona voters' rejection of a state holiday in honor of slain civil rights movement leader Martin Luther King Jr., as a number of teams rejected an invitation to play in the game before Alabama agreed. Players on both teams altered their uniforms in King's memory. Louisville players wore a jersey patch reading, \\"The Dream Lives On\\" (referencing King's 1963 \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech), as well as a helmet decal representing the university's cultural diversity, while Alabama players wore black armbands with \\"MLK\\" on them.

In most mammals, the enzyme hydroxylates N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), producing N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc are mammalian cell surface proteins that are part of the sialic acid family. The CMAH equivalent in humans is a pseudogene (CMAHP); there is no detectable Neu5Gc in normal human tissue. This deficiency has a number of proposed effects on humans, including increased brain growth and improved self-recognition by the human immune system. Incorporation of Neu5Gc from red meat and dairy into human tissues has been linked to chronic disease, including type-2 diabetes and chronic inflammation.  Discovery  The biosynthesis pathway of Neu5Gc from Neu5Ac was discovered by Shaw and Schauer in 1988, while the protein and DNA sequences for Neu5Gc, Neu5Ac, and CMAHP were described by Irie et al. in 1998.  Evolution  Genomic analyses indicate that CMAH genes are present only in deuterostomes, some unicellular algae and some bacteria. CMAH relatives have been lost in many other deuterostome lineages, including tunicates, many groups of fish, the axolotl, most reptiles, and all birds. Among mammals, the gene is missing or nonfunctional in New World monkeys, the European hedgehog, ferrets, some bats, the sperm whale, and the platypus. These animals lacking a functional CMAH gene do not express Neu5Gc. The absence of Neu5Gc in humans is due to a 92-bp deletion of an exon of the human gene CMAH . Sequences encoding mouse, pig, and chimpanzee CMAH have been examined using cDNA cloning techniques and were found to be highly similar. However, the homologous human cDNA differs from these cDNAs by a 92-bp deletion in the 5' region. This deletion, corresponding to exon 5 of the mouse hydroxylase gene, causes a frameshift mutation and premature termination of the polypeptide chain in humans. Neu5Gc seems to be undetectable in human tissues because the truncated version of human hydroxylase mRNA cannot encode for an active enzyme. The deletion that deactivated this gene occurred approximately 3.2 mya, after the divergence of humans from the African great apes, and quickly swept to fixation in the human population. The lineage of this pseudogene in humans indicates another deep split in Africa dating to 2.9 mya, with a complex subsequent history. Sexual selection may have contributed to the fixation of nonfunctional CMAH in humans. This hypothesis has been tested in mice, with females carrying nonfunctional CMAH exhibiting reproductive incompatibility with males carrying functional CMAH due to anti-Neu5Gc antibodies migrating to the female reproductive tract and destroying Neu5Gc-positive sperm.  Function in other mammals  Sialic acids such as Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc are terminal components of the carbohydrate chains of glycoconjugates involved in ligand‚Äìreceptor, cell‚Äìcell, and cell‚Äìpathogen interactions. Neu5Gc has been shown to be involved in a variety of processes in mice, including protein metabolism, signal transduction, metabolism of most organic molecules, and immunity. = Cat AB blood group = The blood type for a cat is mostly covered by the AB blood group system, determined by the CMAH alleles a cat possess. The majority A type seems to be dominant over the recessive B type, which is only found with a higher frequency in some breeds. An \\"AB\\" type seems to be expressed by a third recessive allele.  Function in humans  Neu5Gc has been found in normal human tissue, with larger amounts found in fetal and cancerous tissues. Studies suggest that Neu5Gc could be an excellent cancer cell marker. Since Neu5Gc can only be made by functional CMAH, which is not present in humans, researchers have searched for alternative sources of Neu5Gc in humans. Current research indicates that Neu5Gc is incorporated into human tissues through consumption of red meats and dairy. This incorporation process involves macropinocytosis, delivery to the lysosome, and export of free Neu5Gc to the cytosol via the sialin transporter. Because Neu5Gc differs from Neu5Ac by only one oxygen, it is handled like a native sialic acid by human biochemical pathways. The immune system does not work the same way, however; all humans have varying amounts of a diverse spectrum of anti-Neu5Gc antibodies. If Neu5Gc is constantly being incorporated into tissues due to a diet heavy in red meats and dairy, anti-Neu5Gc antibodies cause chronic inflammation, especially in blood vessels and the linings of hollow organs. These sites are also common places for atherosclerosis and epithelial carcinomas, both of which are associated with red meat and dairy consumption and are aggravated by chronic inflammation. Red meat ingestion and chronic inflammation have also been associated with diseases like type-2 diabetes and age-dependent macular degeneration, so Neu5Gc may be linked to the development of these disorders as well. Recent data suggests that the hypoxic conditions in carcinomas can up- regulate the expression of the lysosomal sialic acid transporter necessary for Neu5Gc incorporation into human tissues. In addition, growth factors may activate enhanced macropinocytosis, which can increase Neu5Gc incorporation. Studies have shown that fetal tissues are also capable of taking up Neu5Gc from maternal dietary sources, which may explain elevated levels of Neu5Gc in the human fetus. The presence of Neu5Gc in various biotherapeutics derived from animal products may impact human health and is still being studied. Some complications could include immune hypersensitivity reactions, reduced half- life of the biotherapeutic in circulation, immune complex formation, increase of Neu5Gc antibody concentration, enhanced immunoreactivity against the biotherapeutic polypeptide, and directly loading more Neu5Gc into tissues.  Implications for human evolution  Pseudogenes such as CMAH can be used to study allele fixation and demographic history. Analyses of CMAH haplotype diversity have been used to examine human demographic history during the Plio- Pleistocene. The functional loss of CMAH after the divergence of humans from the great apes has several implications for its role in human development, including less constrained brain growth and increased running endurance, two traits thought to be important to human evolution. In most mammals, CMAH expression is down-regulated in the brain, and experimental up-regulation of CMAH is lethal in mice. Experimental CMAH loss in mice increases running endurance and decreases muscle fatigue, which could have been beneficial to ancestral Homo during the gene's fixation.  Implications for pathogenicity  The loss of Neu5Gc in humans may have contributed to resistance to generalist pathogens and increased pathogenicity of human-specific pathogens. Human-specific cholera, which employs host sialic acids to trigger a gastrointestinal response, preferentially uses Neu5Ac and is inhibited by Neu5Gc. Nonfunctionialization of CMAH has made humans more susceptible to some viruses by decreasing sialic acid diversity. Viruses that bind to Neu5Ac before entering the cell are enhanced by the high density of Neu5Ac, which would be reduced if other sialic acids were present on human cell membranes. For example, the most serious form of malaria in humans, P. falciparum, binds to Neu5Ac on the membrane of red blood cells. In contrast to these negative effects, losing CMAH should actually protect humans against any virus that targets Neu5Gc, such as those that cause diarrheal diseases in livestock , E. coli K99, transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), and simian virus 40 (SV40).

Clinical significance  SDPR is shown to act as a metastasis suppressor by xenograft studies utilizing breast cancer cell lines. SDPR may elicit its metastasis suppressor function by directly interacting with ERK and limiting its pro-survival role. Moreover, it is suggested that SDPR is silenced during breast cancer progression by promoter DNA methylation. Metastasis suppressor role of SDPR may go beyond breast cancer since tumor samples from bladder, colorectal, lung, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers as well as sarcomas also exhibited loss of SDPR expression.

Both his parents had been born in central North Carolina, his mother in Wake County and his father in Edgecombe County. Battle would have at least 8 siblings. In 1835, after the expulsion of Creek Indians from the area, his parents moved to Irwinton, Alabama (a now-vanished town along the Chattahoochee River near modern Eufaula) in Barbour County, Alabama. Battle received a private education appropriate for his class, then studied at the University of Alabama, and after graduation he read law with his brother-in-law John Gill Shorter, who would become Governor of Alabama. In 1851 Cullen Battle married Georgia Florida Williams of LaGrange, Troup County, Georgia.https://www.ncpedia.org/biography/battle-cullen-andrews In the 1840 U.S. Federal Census, \\"Andrews Battle\\" owed 13 slaves in Troup County, Georgia, but this man indexed as \\"Callin\\" Battle had no dependents nor slaves and his father \\"Cullen Battle\\" with a household of 7 free white people owned 219 slaves in Barbour County, Georgia. They had several children, including Rev. Henry Wilson Battle (b. 1855), a Baptist minister who moved back to North Carolina and later Petersburg, Virginia, and daughters Jenny (b. 1863) and Florence (b. 1867). Early career Admitted to the Alabama bar in 1852, Battle opened his private legal practice in Tuskegee, Macon County, Alabama. In 1850, his father owned 243 enslaved people in Barbour County.1850 U.S. Federal Census slave schedules for Division 23, Barbour County, Alabama pp. 59-61 of 131 In 1860, he or his father would own 66 slaves in Macon County,1860 U.S. Federal Census slave schedules for Southern division, Macon County, Alabama p. 2 of 82 and another 111 slaves in Russell County, Alabama (adjacent to Barbour County and named after an Indian fighter).1860 U.S. Federal Census slave schedules for Southern division, Russell County, Alabama p. 47-48 of 117 The younger Battle also became active in local politics. He became a presidential elector and also was lieutenant colonel of the local militia. When John Brown raided Harpers Ferry, Virginia, Battle raised a militia company and offered to assist the Virginia soldiers, but Virginia's Governor Wise declined his offer.https://www.ncpedia.org/biography/battle- cullen-andrews American Civil War When the Civil War began, Battle received a commission as major of the 3rd Alabama Infantry on April 28, 1861, and was sent with the regiment to Norfolk, Virginia. On July 31, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the regiment. He fought at the Battle of Seven Pines and was promoted to colonel on May 31, 1862. He missed the Seven Days Battles, but returned to the army in time for the Maryland Campaign, in September 1862, fighting at the battles of South Mountain and Antietam. He was injured after falling from his horse just before the Chancellorsville Campaign and was forced to relinquish command. Although he re-assumed command just a day later, his injuries were aggravated when his horse jumped a ditch, forcing him to turn over command again. Battle returned to the regiment for the Gettysburg Campaign. The 3rd Alabama was one of the regiments in Edward O'Neal's Brigade, fighting on Oak Ridge on July 1. After O'Neal's Brigade had been terribly disorganized by the first day of battle, Colonel Battle attached his regiment to Brig. Gen. Stephen D. Ramseur's brigade for the remainder of the battle. General Robert E. Lee became displeased with O'Neal's performance and relieved him of command, putting Battle in his place. Battle subsequently led the brigade in the Mine Run Campaign and the Bristoe Campaign in the autumn and early winter. In 1864, Battle led his men in the battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania Court House, North Anna, and Cold Harbor. Later that year, Battle's Brigade became part of Lt. gen. Jubal A. Early's Army of the Valley and participated in the Battle of Monocacy in Maryland and the Battle of Fort Stevens on the outskirts of Washington, D.C. Back in the Shenandoah Valley, Battle fought at the Third Battle of Winchester, the Battle of Fisher's Hill, and was wounded at the Battle of Cedar Creek. His wound did not permit him to return to duty before the close of hostilities. Postbellum career After the war, Battle returned to his legal practice in Tuskegee, Alabama. He received a pardon from President Andrew Johnson during his controversial self-reconstruction policy for the former Confederate states. Despite Battle's election by voters (who in 3 other states also elected former Confederate Generals as their erstwhile representatives in Congress), the United States House of Representatives denied him a seat (likewise the other former high Confederate officeholders) and instead imposed Congressional Reconstruction on the former Confederate areas until they adopted state Constitutions. In the 1870 census, Battle listed his occupation as \\"farmer\\"1870 U.S. Federal Census for Tuskegee, Macon County, Alabama Family No. 620 and in the 1880 federal census, he listed his occupation as \\"editor.\\" 1880 U.S. Federal Census for Tuskegee, Macon County, Alabama Family No. 58.

Originally published in Galaxy Science Fiction (December 1968), it won a 1968 Hugo Award for Best Novelette and was nominated for a 1969 Nebula Award. The story has appeared in the collections The Night Face & Other Stories (1979), The Dark Between the Stars (1981), Winners (1981), and The Long Night (1983). Plot summary After a galactic dark age, humanity sends an expedition to a primitive human planet, where all cultures practice cannibalism as a rite of manhood. When one of the expedition members is brutally killed, his wife embarks on a mission of vengeance. Evalyth Sairn is a woman of Kraken, from a society where both sexes learn the art of combat. She accompanies her husband Donli, a scientist from the civilized world Atheia, to a planet that reverted to complete savagery during the collapse of galactic civilization. She manages camp security for the expedition. Donli is killed and eviscerated by Moru, a local guide, while out on an expedition. The whole incident is recorded by the camera on Donli's communicator while Evalyth watches in horror. After recovering from the shock, she begins to study Moru's people, discovering their bizarre rites of passage where young boys eat certain organs of men, usually slaves, criminals, or prisoners of war, in order to become men. The organs Moru took from Donli match those used in the rites. Moru himself was lame and too poor to buy them from the usual sources. At first, Evalyth is consumed by the need for vengeance. Under the terms of the expedition, each member is allowed to live by their own customs, which in her society demand blood for blood. With the aid of an artificial intelligence she finds a way of tracking Moru using genetically engineered bugs that detect the unique chemical makeup of Donli's body. With Moru in captivity, she begins to doubt that Donli would have wanted her to kill for him and instead looks at the problem the way Donli himself might have. Instead of assuming that the rites are mere customs, she asks the AI for other possibilities. The AI offers the example of dung flies (the Diptera mentioned in the alternate title) which have evolved to depend on nutrients from prey insects. The conclusion is that Moru's people have lost the ability to undergo maturation without hormones from the cannibalism. The camp doctor informs her that once the genetic defect is found, it can be easily cured. Moru is brought before her. Although she intended to kill him, she announces that she had her revenge by imagining that nothing would be done for his people, and they would live in fear forever. Producing a knife, she does not harm him, but cuts his bonds and tells him to remember Donli.

Most species are epiphytes but a few species only grow on rocks or in leaf litter. Orchids in this genus usually have short stems, leaves arranged in two rows and flowers arranged along unbranched flowering stems. Most species are endemic to Australia but some are found in New Guinea and New Caledonia. Description Orchids in the genus Sarcochilus are epiphytic or lithophytic monopodial herbs with fibrous stems and long, relatively broad leaves folded lengthwise and arranged in two ranks. The flowers are scented, resupinate and arranged on an unbranched flowering stem, each flower on a short thin stalk. The sepals and petals are free from and similar to each other except that the petals are usually smaller than the sepals. The labellum is hinged to the column and has three lobes. The sides lobes are relatively large and upright, sometimes curving inwards. The structure of the middle lobe varies between species. Taxonomy and naming The genus Sarcochilus was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown and the description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. The name Sarcochilus is derived from the Ancient Greek words sarx meaning \\"flesh\\" and cheilos meaning \\"lip\\", referring to the fleshy labellum of these orchids. The genus Sarcochilus has been shown to be non-monophyletic.  Species  The following is a list of Sarcochilus species recognised by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families as at December 2018.

Top row: unaffected fish; bottom row: fish preyed upon by the carnivorous alga Pfiesteria shumwayae. Predatory dinoflagellates are predatory heterotrophic or mixotrophic alveolates that derive some or most of their nutrients from digesting other organisms. About one half of dinoflagellates lack photosynthetic pigments and specialize in consuming other eukaryotic cells, and even photosynthetic forms are often predatory. Organisms that derive their nutrition in this manner include Oxyrrhis marina, which feeds phagocytically on phytoplankton, Polykrikos kofoidii, which feeds on several species of red- tide and/or toxic dinoflagellates, Ceratium furca, which is primarily photosynthetic but also capable of ingesting other protists such as ciliates, Cochlodinium polykrikoides, which feeds on phytoplankton, Gambierdiscus toxicus, which feeds on algae and produces a toxin that causes ciguatera fish poisoning when ingested, and Pfiesteria and related species such as Luciella masanensis, which feed on diverse prey including fish skin and human blood cells. Predatory dinoflagellates can kill their prey by releasing toxins or phagocytize small prey directly.Wiley Interscience Some predatory algae have evolved extreme survival strategies. For example, Oxyrrhis marina can turn cannibalistic on its own species when no suitable non-self prey is available, and Pfiesteria and related species have been discovered to kill and feed on fish, and since have been (mistakenly) referred to as carnivorous \\"algae\\" by the media.  Usage in popular media  The media has applied the term carnivorous or predatory algae mainly to Pfiesteria piscicida, Pfiesteria shumwayae and other Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellates implicated in harmful algal blooms and fish kills. Pfiesteria as an \\"ambush predator\\" utilizes a \\"hit and run\\" feeding strategy by releasing a toxin that paralyzes the respiratory systems of susceptible fish, such as menhaden, thus causing death by suffocation. It then consumes the tissue sloughed off its dead prey. Pfiesteria piscicida () has been blamed for killing more than one billion fish in the Neuse and Pamlico river estuaries in North Carolina and causing skin lesions in humans in the 1990s. It has been described as \\"skinning fish alive to feed on their flesh\\" or chemically sensing fish and producing lethal toxins to kill their prey and feed off the decaying remains. Its deadly nature has led to Pfiesteria being referred to as \\"killer algae\\" and has earned the organism the reputation as the \\"T. rex of the dinoflagellate world\\" or \\"the Cell from Hell.\\" =\\"Pfiesteria hysteria\\"= The prominent and exaggerating media coverage of Pfiesteria as carnivorous algae attacking fish and humans has been implicated in causing \\"Pfiesteria hysteria\\" in the Chesapeake Bay in 1997 resulting in an apparent outbreak of human illness in the Pocomoke region in Maryland. However, a study published the following year concluded the symptoms were unlikely to be caused by mass hysteria.  In popular culture  During the media coverage in the 1990s, Pfiesteria has been referred to as \\"super villain\\" and subsequently has been used as such in several fictional works. A Pfiesteria subspecies killing humans featured in James Powlik's 1999 environmental thriller Sea Change. In Frank Sch√§tzing's 2004 science fiction novel The Swarm, lobsters and crabs spread the killer alga Pfiesteria homicida to humans. In Yann Martel's 2001 novel Life of Pi, the protagonist encounters a floating island of carnivorous algae inhabited by meerkats while shipwrecked in the Pacific Ocean. At a book reading in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, Martel explained that the carnivorous algae island had the purpose of representing the more fantastical of two competing stories in his novel and challenge the reader to a \\"leap of faith.\\" In the 2005 National Geographic TV show Extraterrestrial, the alien organism termed Hysteria combines characteristics of Pfiesteria with those of cellular slime molds. Like Pfiesteria, Hysteria is a unicellular, microscopic predator capable of producing a paralytic toxin. Like cellular slime molds, it can release chemical stress signals that cause the cells to aggregate into a swarm which allows the newly formed superorganism to feed on much larger animals and produce a fruiting body that releases spores for reproduction.

This sinking of a neutral nation's ship in an area considered until then to be relatively safe from U-boats, and the plight of her crew and passengers, caused a political incident in the United States. On the 75th anniversary of its sinking, the American Merchant Marine Museum in Kings Point, New York, opened an exhibit on the sinking of Robin Moor entitled \\"How to Abandon ship.\\" Construction, prior names, and owners  The ship was completed in 1919 by the emergency shipbuilding works of American International Shipbuilding Corp. at Hog Island, just outside Philadelphia. She was a \\"Hog Islander,\\" the name for the class of ugly but sturdy merchant vessels built at the works during that period. She was laid down as Shetucket, and completed as Nobles. In 1928 she was renamed Exmoor for American Export Lines Inc, of New York. In 1940 she was sold to Seas Shipping Co. Inc., of New York, and renamed Robin Moor. Her sinking A painting of the SS Robin Moor sinking. In May 1941 Robin Moor was carrying nine officers, 29 crewmen, eight passengers, and a commercial cargo from New York to Mozambique via South Africa, without a protective convoy. The ship held \\"items of every conceivable description that would go into a general cargo\\", including over 450 autos and trucks, steel rails, tools, agricultural chemicals, over of lubricant in drums, cases of shotgun shells, and a few .22 caliber rifles destined for sporting goods stores. On 21 May, the ship was stopped by in the tropical Atlantic 750 miles west of the British-controlled port of Freetown, Sierra Leone. Although Robin Moor was flying the flag of a neutral country, her mate was told by the U-boat crew that they had decided to \\"let us have it.\\" After a brief period for the ship's crew and passengers to board her four lifeboats, the U-boat fired a torpedo at the rudder and then shelled the vacated ship at the bridge. Once the ship disappeared beneath the waves, the submarine's crew pulled up to Captain W. E. Myers' lifeboat, left him with four tins of pressed black bread (which \\"the lifeboat passengers found ... too tough to eat\\") and two tins of butter, and explained that the ship had been sunk because she was carrying supplies to Germany's enemy. The actions of Metzler of U-69 caused many to question his motives since Hitler himself, preparing for a June invasion of Russia, had specifically instructed his Navy chief, Admiral Erich Raeder: \\"...in the next weeks all attacks on naval vessels in the closed area should cease...\\" Hitler did not wish to provoke America into joining with Britain in its fight against Germany. Source: \\"'Outrageous and Indefensible'/The Sinking of the SS Robin Moor, 1941\\", revised edition, George Haber. Eventual rescue When Robin Moor was stopped, the Germans had forbidden the ship's crew to touch their wireless, but after the sinking, U-69s captain, Jost Metzler, reportedly promised the ship's crew to radio their position. The captain kept the lifeboats near Robin Moors position for 24 hours, then navigated towards St. Paul's Rocks or the Brazilian coast with all four lifeboats bound together. The captain split the lifeboats apart on 26 May as that strategy wasn't working. The lifeboat containing the captain and 10 others was rescued on 8 June after 18 days by the Brazilian merchant ship Os√≥rio with their rescue radioed from Os√≥rio to the Brazilian ship Lages, from there to the US merchant ship Deer Lodge, and from there to RCA which relayed it to Washington D.C. Os√≥rio then went to Pernambuco where Brazil allowed US ambassadors to interview the rescued survivors first. On 14 June, the Maritime Commission asked ships in the area of Robin Moors sinking to be on the lookout for survivors, though the New York Times stated \\"Little or no hope is held out\\" for the remainder of the survivors. On 13 June, two Connecticut residents independently stated they heard short-wave broadcasts from Italy that a submarine had docked at an Italian port and contained eight survivors from Robin Moor. This proved to be unfounded. The occupants of the rescued lifeboat presumed that the remaining crew and passengers were lost, but the others had been discovered on 2 June and taken to South Africa by the cargo vessel SS City of Wellington. City of Wellington (later sunk by a U-boat in August 1942) was operating under radio silence, but were able to receive the news that the captain's party was rescued and those rescued by City of Wellington were presumed dead. The City of Wellington survivors landed in Cape Town on 18 June and their rescue was immediately in the news. All of the crew and passengers were rescued. The Brazil contingent returned to America via SS Delargentino. Aftermath Leo Waalen, FBI file photo. Isolationist United States Senator Gerald Nye, blaming Britain for sinking Robin Moor, said he would be \\"very much surprised if a German submarine had done it because it would be to their disadvantage\\" to torpedo the ship. On 11 June, The New York Times, reporting several different rumors pointing to German blame, also said there may have been Italian submarines in the area, and quoted a German source that said the reports were \\"confusing, unclear, and contradictory.\\" Nye withdrew his comment on 14 June 1941, stating \\"The evidence that the Robin Moor was sunk by a German submarine is too complete to permit my declaration of yesterday noon, to the effect that the boat might have been sunk by Britain, to stand\\", through the America First Committee. President Roosevelt later stated in a message to Congress regarding the sinking that the survivors were \\"accidentally discovered and rescued by friendly vessels. This chance rescue does not lessen the brutality of casting the boats adrift in mid-ocean.\\"John T. Woolley and Gerhard Peters, The American Presidency Project Senator Theodore F. Green (D-RI) stated \\"I don't think the sinking will have any more effect than the sinking of The Panay by Japan. An act of war is bilateral, not unilateral.\\" Also speaking about the Panay incident, Representative Melvin J. Maas (R-MN) said \\"Japan... not only failed to rescue survivors but machine- gunned them afterward and we didn't go to war.\\" Senator Pat McCarran said \\"It is nothing to get excited about\\". Senator Ralph O. Brewster said \\"The effect of the sinking depends on the attitude of Germany whether it is a determined policy or an accident\\". U.S. Representative John William McCormack said \\"It was very unfortunate but there is no reason now to get unnecessarily excited over this incident\\". Representative Andrew J. May, chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, said \\"We ought to convoy with battleships and let the shooting start and see who shoots first and who can outshoot\\". While President Roosevelt responded to the sinking with strong words, the strength of his administration's actions was disputed. His message to Congress described Germany's decision to sink the ship as \\"a disclosure of policy as well as an example of method.\\" His message concluded: German assets were frozen on 12 June, then on 14 June the State Department required Germany and Italy to close all of their consulates in the United States except for their embassies, prompting Germany to issue the same directive to the United States in return. The US also demanded damages and reparations from Germany, without success. In Congress, isolationist Senator Burton K. Wheeler) claimed that 70% of the ship's cargo constituted the kind of materials meeting both German and British standards for contraband, defended the legality of Germany's right to destroy her, and characterised Roosevelt's message as an effort to bring the United States into the war. Others, such as Senator Claude Pepper, urged their colleagues to require the arming of merchant vessels. In October 1941, federal prosecutors in the espionage case against a group of 33 defendants known as the \\"Duquesne Spy Ring\\" adduced testimony that Leo Waalen, one of the 14 accused men who had pled not guilty, had submitted the sailing date of the Robin Moor for radio transmission to Germany, five days before the ship began her final voyage. Waalen and the others were found guilty on 13 December 1941. In literature John J. Banigan, the Third Officer of SS Robin Moor, went on to write How to Abandon Ship (), which details his experience and serves as a survival guide for sailors serving in a wartime environment.

Its remains are located at the east end of Zaimokuza Beach near Kamakura and are still visible at low tide. It was built in 1232 and, in spite of its state of disrepair, it has been declared a national Historic Site because it is the sole surviving example of an artificial harbor from the Kamakura period. Although its component stones have sunk in the sand, its general contour is still clearly visible when the tide is low as a mound about 200m long.

On the beach, a large rock surmounted by a black stele marks the position of the former port. The stele, erected by the Kamakuramachi Seinendan (Kamakura Youth Club) in 1924, explains in Japanese the history of the site and its importance. History During the Kamakura shogunate, Sagami Bay was busy with trading ships, but the shallowness of the bay made the use of barges indispensable. Accidents between ships were common and it was therefore decided to build a port. A priest named applied for permission from the Shogunate to build an artificial port in the area. Permission was granted in 1232. In its first form, the harbor functioned as both a breakwater and a wharf and was built with large stones laid as a foundation, with smaller stones on top.

Eventually, the individual parts of the pig were auctioned; his squeal was auctioned for $25 on at least one occasion. After each auction, King Neptune was returned to be auctioned again later. High demand for appearances by Neptune led them to travel the rest of Illinois raising funds. The mostly red, with white features, Hereford was often displayed covered with a blue Navy blanket and wearing a crown and silver earrings. On March 6, 1943, Illinois Governor Dwight H.

Myopalladin has five Ig-like repeats within the protein, and a proline-rich domain. Myopalladin binds the Src homology domain of nebulette and nebulin and tethers it to alpha-actinin via its C-terminal domain binding to the EF hand domains of alpha-actinin.

On April 16, 1862, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the regiment and on May 5 saw his first action at the Battle of Williamsburg, on the Peninsula. He succeeded to the command of the regiment following the Battle of Seven Pines, where he had been wounded. He returned to duty in time to participate in the Maryland Campaign and fought at the Battle of South Mountain and the Battle of Antietam. At Chancellorsville, Johnston was given command of the 12th North Carolina Infantry, after that unit had lost all of its field officers. He returned to the 23rd for the Gettysburg Campaign and was wounded at the Battle of Gettysburg. He was promoted to brigadier general on September 1, 1863, and was given command of the brigade that Brig. Gen. Alfred Iverson, Jr., had commanded at Gettysburg. He commanded the brigade through the Overland Campaign in the spring of 1864 until he suffered his third wound at Spotsylvania. He returned to the brigade in August during Lt. Gen. Jubal A.

It was promoted as an alternative to the economic sanctions and divestment from South Africa demanded by the UN General Assembly and the international anti-apartheid movement. Encouraging South Africa The Reagan administration vetoed legislation from the United States Congress and blocked attempts by the United Nations to impose sanctions and to isolate South Africa. Instead, advocates of constructive engagement sought to use incentives as a means of encouraging South Africa to gradually move away from apartheid. The policy, echoed by the British government of Margaret Thatcher, came under criticism as South African government repression of the black population and anti-apartheid activism intensified. The policy's architect, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Chester Crocker, designed it to link the independence of South African‚Äìoccupied Namibia to an easing of the arms embargo against South Africa and the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. Author/journalist Christopher Hitchens blamed constructive engagement and \\"the fearlessly soft attitude displayed by Chester Crocker towards apartheid\\" for the ten-year delay in implementing United Nations Security Council Resolution 435 and securing Namibia's independence: > Independence on these terms could have been won years ago if it were not for > Crocker's procrastination and Reagan's attempt to change the subject to the > presence of Cuban forces in Angola. Here again, the United States > dogmatically extended diplomatic recognition to one side only ‚Äì South > Africa's. Here again, without 'neutral' mediators American policy would have > deservedly become the victim of its own flagrant bias. An important > participant was Bernt Carlsson, UN Commissioner for Namibia, who worked > tirelessly for free elections in the colony and tried to isolate the racists > diplomatically. Influence of the Cold War Ronald Reagan's election in 1980 offered the regime in Pretoria a conservative president who, in an early speech, declared his support for the white minority government of South Africa, and their support for the US in times of war. After the administration of previous President Jimmy Carter had pledged to support majority rule in South Africa, South African President P. W. Botha saw in Reagan what he saw in Thatcher: a leader who would respect his regime's battle against communism in Southern Africa. The Cold War and threat of Soviet influence in the region, Namibia in particular, enabled the South African government to appeal to the Reagan administration's fear of an African \\"domino effect.\\" In light of this, South Africa received both economic and military aid during Reagan's first term. The US Department of State also believed that \\"Constructive Engagement\\" would lead over time to a regime change. US policy feared a sudden revolution in South Africa as being a potential power vacuum, opening the door to a Marxist, Soviet-backed regime, like that in Angola. Over-ride of presidential veto The build-up to what was to become the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 can be traced to Archbishop Desmond Tutu who visited the United States in 1984. This visit occurred after President Reagan's comfortable re-election. Speaking on Capitol Hill Tutu delivered a speech, declaring \\"constructive engagement is an abomination, an unmitigated disaster.\\"‚Ä¶ \\"In my view, the Reagan administration's support and collaboration with it is equally immoral, evil, and totally un-Christian.\\" This speech was the turning point for the Reagan administration, and also the beginning of the end of \\"Constructive Engagement\\". In April 1985 President Reagan came under attack from within the Republican Party itself. The Republican majority in the Senate voted 89‚Äì4 on a resolution condemning apartheid. In October 1986, the United States Congress overrode President Reagan's veto of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act (the Senate vote was 78 to 21, the House vote was 313 to 83). During the lead-up to the override, Reagan appointed Edward Perkins, who is black, ambassador to South Africa. Conservative Representative Dick Cheney was opposed to the override, saying that Nelson Mandela was the head of an organisation that the State Department had deemed \\"terrorist\\". In the week leading up to the vote, President Reagan appealed to members of the Republican Party for support, but as Senator Lowell P. Weicker, Jr. would state, \\"For this moment, at least, the President has become an irrelevancy to the ideals, heartfelt and spoken, of America.\\" The legislation, which banned all new US trade and investment in South Africa, also refused South African Airways flights landing permission at US airports. This legislation was seen as a catalyst for similar sanctions in Europe and Japan, and signalled the end of the constructive engagement policy.

Author and screenwriter Phillip Rock wrote the novelization of Dirty Harry in 1971, based on an early draft of the script. Mel Valley wrote the sequel, Magnum Force, in 1973. Wesley Morgan novelized The Enforcer in 1976. The Sudden Impact novelization was written by Joseph Stinson, one of the screenwriters. Stinson, who had rewritten the originally independent script as a Dirty Harry vehicle for Eastwood, adapted the novel in 1983. Original novels Following The Enforcer, Eastwood announced that he would not make any further Dirty Harry films (he eventually returned to the role in Sudden Impact in 1983 and The Dead Pool in 1988).

Fitzroy Recruited from Hamilton Football Club, Colin was a solid, hard working ruckman, with tremendous stamina and a good mark. He was especially valuable when resting in the forward lines, and combined well with champion rover Haydn Bunton, (who started playing with Fitzroy in 1931). Colin played 81 senior games for Fitzroy between 1930 and 1936, and kicked 70 goals. Benham's famous \\"in-off the small boy\\" goal On Saturday 30 June 1934, Fitzroy were playing against South Melbourne at the Lake Oval in front of a crowd of 27,000, plus Baron Huntingfield, who served as Governor of Victoria from 1934 to 1939, who had come to see his first match of Australian Rules Football.\\"A Wonderful Game\\": Governor at South Melbourne, The Age, (Monday, 2 July 1934), p.6. With only seconds remaining, South Melbourne led Fitzroy 13.19 (97) to 12.10 (82). Benham took a mark close to the goals, and went back to line up his kick. The final bell rang and by the time he had started his run-in, most of his teammates had begun to leave the field. As the ball left his boot, some boys had started to jump the fence and run on to congratulate the South Melbourne players, unaware that the match was not yet officially over. The ball veered sideways off Benham's boot, and from his perspective it was clear that it would be a behind; but, as the ball neared the goal-line, it struck one of the running boys and was deflected between the goalposts. Because the football had not hit another player, the goal umpire had no alternative but to award the goal (6 points), rather than the behind (1 point) that it would otherwise have been, and South Melbourne's winning margin was reduced to nine points: 13.19 (97) to 13.10 (88).Chisolm, A.H, \\"Fitzroy's Failure\\", The Argus, (Monday, 2 July 1934), p.9.Gruelling Struggle, The Age, (Monday, 2 July 1934), p.6.Ross, 1996, p.142.

Plot summary On Balfrost, a planet that experiences decades-long seasons, the Playpoint resort attracts tourists during the warm seasons. In winter it is maintained by an artificial intelligence who was once a man, Andrew Aldon, and a pair of custodians, a man and a woman, who are in suspended animation except for a few days each year when they awake to inspect and maintain the resort. The resort has powerful weapons to keep encroaching ice at bay. Paul Plaige, a former custodian who left under suspicious circumstances, returns in winter with his latest paramour, a woman named Dorothy. His real reason for returning is to retrieve some precious stones lost in a cave-in that claimed his partner, a woman named Glenda. In the years since Paul's departure, Andrew Aldon has noticed a change in the weather patterns. He believes that the planet is somehow intelligent, as in the Gaia hypothesis. Paul sets out to find the stones, with the weather curiously helping him by maintaining a calm area around him. Later, Dorothy tries to follow with help from Andrew Aldon. Paul comes upon a cave containing Glenda's corpse, somehow preserved. In fact Glenda is still alive, having merged with a biological network present across the planet, and has been controlling the weather. In the confrontation that follows, Dorothy sees Paul with Glenda's re-animated body. Andrew, in touch through Dorothy's wrist communicator, tries to prevent a conflict, but instead Glenda causes his personality to switch places with Paul's. Andrew and Dorothy leave the planet, while Paul and Glenda act out their hatred for each other with the weapons of Playpoint and the planet's weather.

Canup is known for her research based upon the giant impact hypothesis, using intensive modeling to simulate how planetary collisions unfold. In 2012, Canup first published a refinement to the giant impact hypothesis, arguing that the Moon and the Earth formed in a series of steps that started with a massive collision of two planetary bodies, each larger than Mars, which then re-collided to form what we now call Earth. After the re-collision, Earth was surrounded by a disk of material, which combined to form the Moon. She has written a book on the origin of the Earth and Moon.

In the natural state of the Columbia River, there was an stretch above The Dalles known as Celilo Falls that was impassable upstream and navigable downstream only at high water and at great risk. Celilo Canal was built in the early part of the 1900s to allow steamboat and river-borne traffic to bypass Celilo Falls.  History and construction  In 1858, a -long wagon road, the Oregon Portage Railroad, had been built around the falls on the south side of the river. This was replaced in 1863 by a -long portage railway owned by the Oregon Steam Navigation Company. A number of studies and false starts were made towards building a canal around the falls, but construction on what was to become known as the Celilo Canal did not begin until 1905, and then took ten years to complete.Timmen, at 36-39 In 1909, Scientific American summarized the status of the work and its objectives:Willey, Day Allen, \\"The Improvement of the Columbia River\\", Scientific American, February 13, 1909, page 134 Scientific American was also optimistic about the prospective economic value of the canal: The federal government spent 5 million dollars on its construction. For an inaugural cruise, the steamer Undine left Portland April 29 and arrived in Lewiston, May 3, 1915.  Effect on navigation  Boosters of the Celilo Canal organized the Open River Navigation Company, and put the Charles R. Spencer and J.N.

However, completion of the canal came too late to fend off competition from railroads had taken away most of the steamboat's business. Riverine transportation above Celilo never reached the hopes of the proponents of the canal. Only in the late 1930s did the development of wheat barge traffic, eventually driven by diesel towboats, become an important transport method on the Columbia River.Timmen, at 39-47  Current state  The canal and all related works were flooded following the completion of The Dalles Dam in 1957.

Plot summary The story begins with Brian as a child of around 8 or 9 and it ends with him as an 88-year-old man. The book shows his rise to power and his struggle to maintain it. His personal life is an important part of the plot, because Brian's war against M√°el M√≥rda (leader of the Leinstermen) and Sihtric (king of Dublin) was to be inextricably connected with his complicated marital relations, in particular his marriage to Gormlaith, M√°el M√≥rda's sister and Sihtric's mother, who had been in turn the wife of Amla√≠b Cuar√°n, king of Dublin and York, then of M√°el Sechnaill. Even though the book is based on a historical figure, most of it is fiction. Film adaptation In 2003, Ireland based RiverFilms proposed a film adaptation of the book as Braveheart and El Cid meet The Vikings. On March 4th 2019, it was announced in Deadline that a new movie adaptation was in the works. The series would be created by Irish author Michael Scott. The article was subsequently picked up the Sunday Times, and Irish Central who listed both Scott and BCDF Pictures as producers.

It won a retro Hugo Award for Best Novelette in 1996. Two technologically equal species are making first contact in deep space. Both desire the technology and trade the other can provide, but neither can risk the fate of the home planet based on unfounded trust. It was among the stories selected in 1970 by the Science Fiction Writers of America as one of the best science fiction short stories published before the creation of the Nebula Awards. As such, it was published in The Science Fiction Hall of Fame Volume One, 1929-1964. Plot Space travel is routine between planets in the Solar System. Ships function very much like naval warships or research vessels. There are technologies such as \\"overdrive\\" which allows a ship to travel much faster than light in normal space, and apparently artificial gravity within a ship. Atomic power is used everywhere, even in a space suit propulsion unit. Ships are equipped with \\"blasters\\", not necessarily for use as weapons, but for destroying space debris which would otherwise collide with the ship. The exploration ship Llanvabon is approaching the Crab Nebula when it suddenly detects another ship on its radar. The two ships' radars are, in fact, interfering with each other, so each sees a wildly distorted image of the other ship. Even after the problem is resolved and the two crews, one human, one alien, establish communication, both realize they have a problem. Neither can leave without ensuring that the other cannot track them to their home planet. The aliens are humanoid bipeds, but see in the infrared portion of the spectrum. Also, instead of using sound to communicate among themselves they use microwaves emitted from an organ in their heads. As one human points out, \\"From our point of view, they have telepathy. Of course from their point of view, so do we.\\" The crews discover they have much in common. This is especially true of young Tommy Dort and his counterpart on the other ship, to whom he has assigned the name Buck. Although they are only able to communicate through an artificial code, they are able to establish a rapport. However, Buck is pessimistic about the eventual outcome. He sends Tommy a message, \\"You are a good guy. Too bad we must kill each other.\\" The deadlock persists. Neither ship dares to leave for fear that the other will be able to track it home. Neither captain is ready to gamble by attacking the other ship. Then Tommy realizes the way out of the impasse. He and his Captain arrange an exchange of personnel between the ships. Tommy and the Captain go aboard the alien ship even as two aliens board the Llanvabon. Then they present an ultimatum: they will detonate the atomic power packs in their suits if the aliens refuse to go along with their plan, which is for each crew to take the other's ship back to their home planet. Each will disable all the tracking equipment on their own ship before the exchange, and indeed they will have to be thorough to prevent the new crew from tracking them. At this point the aliens begin behaving very strangely, twitching or lying down and kicking the floor. In fact this is their equivalent of laughter. Their own people have just given the humans the same ultimatum, and the same plan. The story ends with each crew taking over the other's ship. Naturally, before leaving their own ship they are able to remove everything which might point back to their home world. Each stands to benefit from the new technology on the other's ship. Each keeps the other race's fiction library to gain insight into their thinking. They agree to repeat the encounter at the same location some time in the future. Tommy is confident that the two races will get along. He believes this because, as he tells the Captain, he and Buck spent a good deal of time swapping dirty jokes. Radio plays This story was performed as a radio play on Dimension X on September 8, 1951 and on X Minus One on October 6, 1955, condensed somewhat and with a different ending. The story was also performed on Exploring Tomorrow on January 15, 1958.  Style  The style and language of First Contact have been seen as illustrative of the Golden Age of science fiction. Legal action against Paramount Pictures In 2000, Leinster's heirs sued Paramount Pictures over the film Star Trek: First Contact, claiming that as the owners of the rights to Leinster's short story \\"First Contact\\", it infringed their trademark in the term. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia granted Paramount's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the suit.Estate of William F. Jenkins v. Paramount Pictures Corp., 90 F. Supp. 2d 706 (E.D. Va. 2000)\\"No 'First Contact' Lawsuit\\", Trek Today, April 3, 2000, accessed Nov. 2, 2008. The court found that regardless of whether Leinster's story first coined the phrase, it had since become a generic and therefore unprotectable term that described the genre of science fiction in which humans first encounter alien species. Even if the title was instead \\"descriptive\\"--a category of terms higher than \\"generic\\" that may be protectable--there was no evidence that the title had the required association in the public's mind (known as \\"secondary meaning\\") such that its use would normally be understood as referring to Leinster's story. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court's dismissal without comment.

Portrayed as the series' first primary antagonist, Mukuro Rokudo is introduced as a 15-year-old Mafia criminal who is the leader of the Kokuyo Gang, which consists of heinous criminals who have recently escaped from prison. However, later on in the series, after possessing the body of Chrome Dokuro, he takes on a more supportive role for the series' main characters, becoming somewhat of an ally rather than an enemy, though he prefers to not want to associate with them. Apart from the manga and anime, Mukuro has also appeared in other media from the Reborn! franchise including video games and novels. Mukuro's character has been well received by readers since his introduction, ranking as one of the most popular characters in every official Shonen Jump poll of the series. Also, his and Kyoya Hibari's character CD entitled \\"Sakura addiction\\", peaked at seventh place on the Oricon charts. Their performance earned each of their voice actors a Seiyu Awards' nomination for \\"Best Musical Performance\\", in addition to Toshinobu Iida being nominated as the \\"Best Rookie Actor\\" for his portrayal as Mukuro Rokudo. Numerous anime and manga publications have commented on Mukuro's character, mostly receiving positive reviews. Merchandise based on his appearance has also been released including key chains and action figures. Character outline=Personality= Mukuro is often seen with a playful smile and seems apathetic to the suffering of others. Appearing as the series' first antagonist, Mukuro is not averse to disposing of those who get in his way, and is not easily intimidated, usually speaking to others in a very direct and arrogant manner. Prior to his first appearance, he, along with Ken Joshima and Chikusa Kakimoto, is mentioned to have been locked up in a high security Italian prison, which is reserved for the most dangerous of Mafia criminals, who have even committed crimes against the Mafia itself. He cares little for others, and simply considers people to be \\"toys\\" he can sacrifice in order to get to what he wants. However, despite claiming this, he seems to tolerate both Ken and Chikusa, and even protects them, as well as sacrifice himself for them, when need be, though does not do so in front of them. He also seems to care for Chrome, though hides it in front of others. To keep his identity hidden, Mukuro periodically controls several people, most notably Lancia, whom he uses as a \\"fake Mukuro\\". Mukuro is implied to have a strong dislike for the entire Mafia underground, due in part to the experimentations he suffered as a child at the hands of the Estraneo Mafia family. When Mukuro killed his captors, he offered Chikusa and Ken, who were also victims of experimentation, a chance to join him in his quest to destroy the world. However, not only does he want to take revenge on the Mafia by destroying it, he also wants to cleanse the world of its filth by invoking universal suffering through a world war. Even after becoming the Vongola's Mist Guardian, Mukuro still claims to no longer be part of the Mafia, having been exiled from it, and continues to view the organization with great contempt. =Weapons and abilities= Known as someone who has driven both the Mafia and police into dangerous and desperate of situations, Mukuro is a deadly opponent. Though Mukuro's main weapon is a trident, and is capable of using combative skills, he is first and foremost a master of illusions, thus he is not easily deceived by illusions that are cast by others. His abilities lie in his , six different skills which he claims has been carved into his memories by having had his body go through all six paths to Hades. When using his skills, a Japanese numeral, corresponding to the realm he has entered, appears in his right eye. The skills granted from the individual paths varies from enhancing his physical and mind-controlling abilities, as well as his power of his illusions, to enabling him to control and summon animals. Mukuro also possesses the Estraneo Family's Possession Bullet, a forbidden bullet which enables a person to possess the body of another person when the possessor is shot with it. With this, Mukuro is able to possess and control the body of anyone that he has cut with his trident. He can possess several bodies simultaneously, and he is also still able to enter the Six Realms, granting him the ability to use a different skill for each body. Appearances=In Reborn!= Adult Mukuro as depicted in the future. After arriving in Japan from Italy, and enrolling in Kokuyo Middle School, ten days prior to their first appearance, Mukuro, Chikusa, and Ken, started a gang made up of Mafia criminals, and began their quest to find the Vongola's tenth generation boss. After having his subordinates attack the strongest students in Namimori Middle School, he successfully draws out the tenth boss, Tsunayoshi Sawada. During Mukuro's fight with Tsuna, he reveals his plans of taking over Tsuna's body in order to take revenge on the Mafia. However, he loses the battle to Tsuna and he and his friends are imprisoned by the Mafia's guardians, the Vendicare. They later attempt a breakout, but Mukuro uses himself as bait, and ends up being thrown into a lower level jail cell. Whilst strolling in his illusions, he comes upon Chrome Dokuro, who was on the verge of death, and possesses her, saving her life with illusionary organs. He then makes a bargain with the Vongola to become one of the ring guardians in exchange for Ken and Chikusa's safety. Now sharing an existence with Chrome, Mukuro later helps her defeat Mammon after he emerges in his own form. In the story's alternate future, Millefiore member Glo Xinia gloats about having defeated him to a displaced Chrome, who had been transported into the future by the Ten-Year Bazooka. However, the future Mukuro had possessed Glo's owl and helps Chrome defeat him in battle. While spying on the Millefiore Family, Mukuro engages Byakuran in battle but is severely wounded. He reappears as an illusion during the Vongola's battle against Byakuran in order to give the Vongola enough time to escape. He is later able to assist them in person after his apprentice, Fran, frees his body from the Vendicare's Prison. After Tsuna's group returns to the past, Mukuro is lured into possessing Chrome when Daemon Spade endangers her life. Mukuro seemingly defeats Daemon, but the latter is able to take over Mukuro's imprisoned body before Mukuro's spirit can return to it and breaks out of prison to confront the group shortly after. He is later restored to his physical form after Tsuna defeats Daemon and expel his spirit. As the Vindice acknowledge Mukuro's efforts in his fight with Daemon, he is freed and returns to Namimori. Several weeks after the battle with Daemon, Mukuro leaves Chrome. He finds and recruits Fran into the group. Verde requests for Mukuro and his gang to fight for him in upcoming Arcobaleno battle, which Mukuro accepted in order to fight Tsuna and his Family. During the first day of the Representative battle, Mukuro's team able to defeat five people within ten minutes, thanks to Verde's machine that able to change illusion into reality. At the second day of the Representative battle, he, and his team fight Tsuna's team and Byakuran's team. At the third day of the Representative Battle, he reluctantly formed temporary alliance with Team Reborn to defeat the Vindice. With Chrome's help and unleashed combined technique, they able to defeat two Vindice with the last one defeated by Tsuna. After Tsuna's brief battle with Jager and knowing the truth about the Arcobaleno, he, along with the other remaining teams formed alliance with Tsuna as the core to defeat Team Bermuda. At the fourth day of Representative Battle, he, Dino, Squalo, Xanxus, and Byakuran confronts Jager, preventing him from helping his teammates while Tsuna, Enma, and Basil defeats them one by one. =In other media= Besides his appearance in the original manga series and its anime adaptation, Mukuro has appeared in other Reborn! works, including all of the series' video games. Mukuro also appears in the first light novel, Hidden Bullet: Mukuro's Illusions, where the events of how Mukuro took over Kokuyo Middle School are revealed. Also, in the series' character book, Vongola77, there is a short story of how Mukuro uses his spiritual powers to control the body of a small boy in Japan in order to once again try to take over Tsuna's body despite being imprisoned in Italy. After failing and realizing that he is incapable of residing in his host body for a long amount of time due to their unstable \\"connection\\", he thought of later taking Chrome's body instead. On November 7, 2007, Pony Canyon released a character CD entitled \\"Sakura addiction\\", which features both Mukuro and Hibari. It contains duets and individual songs sung by both voice actors: Toshinobu Iida and Takashi Kond≈ç.

In the third poll of the series, Mukuro ranked as the third most popular male character, losing to Tsunayoshi Sawada and Kyoya Hibari, who took second and first place, respectively. Mukuro then placed in both popularity polls the fourth time around, which was divided into current characters, where he placed fourth, and as characters who fans would most like to see in their future forms, where he placed fourteenth.

The second annual Seiyu Awards nominated both Toshinobu Iida and Takashi Kond≈ç for \\"Best Musical Performance\\", and Toshinobu also received a \\"Best Rookie Actor\\" nomination for his portrayal as Mukuro Rokudo, but he did not win either. In publications focused on manga and anime reviews, Mukuro's concept has received praise and acclaim. Leroy Douresseaux of comicbookbin.com views him as \\"murderous and supernaturally powerful,\\" as well as being a \\"slippery and formidable villain\\" by the way he attacks Tsuna and his friends. Sam Kusek of Manga Recon likes Mukuro as the enigmatic villain, though believes him to be a \\"big creep\\". He also praises Akira Amano for the originality of Mukuro's techniques, viewing it as \\"one of the most interesting ideas I've seen,\\" and making him, along with Tsuna, the \\"real winners overall\\" of volume 9. However, David Rasmussen from mangalife.com commented that the fight against Mukuro in the manga is a \\"long, long, DragonBall-Z-sized struggle\\".

Marbach stables The Marbach Stud, , is Germany's oldest state stud farm for horse breeding, has a history that dates back over 500 years. It is located in southwest Germany near Gomadingen in the Reutlingen district of Baden-W√ºrttemberg. The annual stallion parade is an internationally known attraction, and the stud hosts over 500,000 visitors per year. The stud also offers courses for those wishing to learn to ride or drive, as well as an instructor training program. Marbach is known for producing athletic horses with good temperaments, and has careful management practices, including that of allowing young, untrained horses the opportunity to grow in a natural setting conducive to their mental as well as their physical development. Marbach was originally significant for its development of the ancestral bloodstock of several warmblood horse breeds, and today continues to produce the W√ºrttemberger. However, it is probably best known as the home stud of the Weil-Marbach Arabians. The majority of Arabian horses bred at Marbach are sold to private owners as personal riding horses, though some are also used in the sport of endurance riding.\\"Marbach\\" In addition to breeding Arabian and W√ºrttembergers, Marbach also stands stallions of the Black Forest Horse breed as well as a few Thoroughbreds, Haflingers and other heavy warmblood stallions. Horses bred at Marbach are performance tested before being allowed reproduce and are branded with a brand symbol called the Hirschgeweih. History Black Forest Horses (Schwarzw√§lder Kaltblut) Marbach was first established as a private stud between 1477 and 1480 by Graf Eberhard V. Christoph, Duke of W√ºrttemberg (r. 1550-1568) expanded the stud and in 1573 it was named a court and state stud, after the ruling Dukes realized a need for improvement in local horse breeds. During the 18th and 19th centuries, Marbach used Mecklenburger, Holstein, and English and Norman-bred horses to improve quality in local horses, while heavier breeds such as the Cleveland Bay, Yorkshire Coach Horse and Clydesdale were used to make a larger, more solid horse. Following World War II and the recognition that there was less need for work horses and a greater future in developing sport horses and general light riding animals, the stud added additional lines such as the Thoroughbred and Trakehner, with the Marbach stallion Julmond (1938‚Äì1965) a significant contributor of traits that transformed the W√ºrttemberger from a work horse into a sport horse. Weil Bairactar Wilhelm I The Weil stud was founded in 1817 at Esslingen by King Wilhelm I of W√ºrttemberg for the purpose of breeding Arabian horses. Among the foundation horses was the mare Murana I 1808, whose dam line still continues at Marbach today. The stallions Bairactar, imported directly from the Arabian desert and his son Amurath I 1829 played a significant part in the development of the Arabian breed at Weil, and made major contributions to the breed throughout Europe, particularly on Arabian horses bred in Poland. Statue of the Arabian stallion Hadban Enzahi at the Marbach Stud Weil-Marbach transition While this establishment thrived though the 19th century, from 1890 on, it went into considerable decline and by the time the Weil herd was transferred from Princess Pauline zu Wied of W√ºrttemberg to the Marbach State Stud in 1932, only 17 purebred Arabians remained. Cowell, Christine. \\"History of the Stud\\" Haupt- und Landgest√ºt Marbach, web site accessed October 2, 2007. To expand the breeding pool, Arabian horses from Poland were used, particularly those of the Ofir line such as the Witez II son Wisznu and the stallion Abu Afas. In 1955, the Arabian stallion Hadban Enzahi was imported from Egypt, along with some other breeding stock, and this infusion of new blood added to the foundation animals established the Weil-Marbach line of Arabians.

Schlesinger moved to South Africa in 1894, against his family's wishes, when he read about the discovery of gold in Witwatersrand. In 1913, having accumulated wealth throughout various ventures, he ventured in to the entertainment industry in 1913 when he purchased the Empire Theatre in Johannesburg for ¬£60,000 and converted what was an \\"insolvent\\" business into a flourishing one named African Consolidated Theatres, which worked on the national distribution of content like variety shows and films from the Cape of Good Hope to the Zambezi River.  History  The studio was founded and funded in the Johannesburg suburb of Killarney by American citizen Isidore W. Schlesinger (d. 1949). Two years earlier, Schlesinger had bought up Australian Rufus Naylor's Africa's Amalgamated Theatres (est. 1911) and Edgar Hyman's Empire Theatres Company (est. 1912) to form the African Theatres and Films Trusts on 10 April 1913. In this way Schlesinger obtained a monopoly over film importation and distribution throughout Southern Africa.Worsdale, Andrew. Jozi and the Movies ‚Äì A history. Gauteng Film Commission.

South African Scriptwriters' Association. Retrieved online 6 January 2008. Whether this production was inspired by Thomas Edison's 1900 film of the same title is unclear, as no copies remain of the South African version. Five more animated short films followed, and film titles were also often animated. African Film Productions made 43 films between 1916 and 1922. The scarcity of international films during the First World War boosted the development of Schlesinger's company. As befits the political context of a newly unified state (the Union of South Africa, 1910) the earlier films aimed at the white market featured co-operation between Boer and Briton as a common theme. Once apartheid started in earnest after 1948, some films took up the theme of whites standing together against black Africans. Apart from feature films, AFP produced \\"documentaries\\" for the state, as well as industrial safety films. During the 1920s to 1940s the distribution of AFP films to the black African market was aided by missionaries such as Reverend Ray Phillips, who from about 1920 wanted to use the medium to impart (Western) morals to black Africans. Phillips showed films to mine workers (most notably, during the 1922 white miners' strike), as well as to the middle class black elite who attended his Bantu Men's Social Centre (established by Phillips in Johannesburg). Most of these films came from Killarney Film Studios.Peterson, Bekhisizwe, 2003. The Politics of Leisure during the Early Days of South African Cinema.

He commanded the 17th Virginia Infantry and then Corse's Brigade of Pickett's Division in the Army of Northern Virginia, and served in several of that army's most important battles. Early life and career Montgomery D. Corse was born in Alexandria, Virginia in 1816, the eldest son of John and Julia Corse. He attended Major Bradley Lowe's military school at Colross and Benjamin Hallowell's school on Washington Street. As a young boy he witnessed Lafayette's 1825 visit to Alexandria and participated in the inauguration of President Andrew Jackson in 1829.M. D. Corse biography, Alexandria Library He worked in business with his father and was then a captain in the 1st Virginia Regiment during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. He sailed for California in 1849 and participated in the Gold Rush. He returned permanently to Alexandria in 1856 and entered the banking business with his brothers, J. D. and William Corse. Three years later became the first lieutenant of the Alexandria Home Guard. In 1860, he organized a militia company known as the Old Dominion Rifles and became its captain.Evans, Clement, Confederate Military History, Atlanta: Confederate Publishing Company, 1899. Civil War service In early 1861 he was given an appointment as the major of the 6th Virginia Infantry Battalion and soon after that he received the colonelcy of the 17th Virginia Infantry. He commanded the 17th at Blackburn's Ford during the First Battle of Manassas, as well during the 1862 Peninsula Campaign. He saw action at the battles of Yorktown, Williamsburg, Seven Pines, and throughout the Seven Days Battles. During the subsequent Northern Virginia Campaign, Corse commanded Kemper's Brigade during the Second Battle of Manassas until he was wounded. He was healthy enough to participate in the Maryland Campaign and was wounded at both South Mountain and Antietam at the head of his regiment. A new brigade was created for him, and he was promoted to brigadier general on November 1. His brigade was placed in a division commanded by General George E. Pickett and was only lightly engaged at Fredericksburg. Corse married Elizabeth Beverley (1825‚Äì1894) on November 22, 1862. They had four children. In early 1863 he accompanied Lt. Gen. James Longstreet on an expedition to southeastern Virginia, resulting of the absence of Corse and his brigade from the rest of the army during the Battle of Chancellorsville. During the Gettysburg Campaign, Corse's Brigade was detached from Pickett's Division to guard Hanover Junction, north of Richmond. Because of this, the brigade did not participate in the battle nor the disastrous assault known as Pickett's Charge.Sifakis, Who Was Who in the Confederacy Pickett's Division was detached from Longstreet's Corps when they were transferred to Georgia and Tennessee in late 1863, operating in western Virginia. In January 1864, Corse and his brigade participated in Pickett's operations against New Bern, North Carolina. After seeing action at Drewry's Bluff against Benjamin Butler's Bermuda Hundred operation, the brigade finally rejoined the Army of Northern Virginia and fought at Cold Harbor and through the Siege of Petersburg. Following the disaster at the Battle of Five Forks, they began the retreat which would eventually end at Appomattox Court House. Corse himself was captured at the Battle of Sayler's Creek on April 6, 1865. After his surrender, General Corse was conveyed to Fort Warren near Boston, Massachusetts, on the day that Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, and he and the fourteen generals accompanying him narrowly escaped the violence of a mob at a town in Pennsylvania on the next morning. They were only saved by the determination of their small guard of Union soldiers and officers.Evans, Confederate Military History. Postbellum career Following the war, he took the Oath of Allegiance to the United States of America on July 24, 1865, and was released from Fort Warren.Alexandria Library website He subsequently returned to his banking profession in Alexandria, Virginia, with his brothers. He was a charter member of the R.E. Lee Camp of the United Confederate Veterans. In 1870, he was seriously injured when part of the Virginia State Capitol building in Richmond collapsed. He suffered partial blindness for several years thereafter. On May 24, 1880, Corse was a distinguished guest along with Governor Fitzhugh Lee and General Joseph E. Johnston at the dedication of the Confederate monument at Washington and Prince Streets in Alexandria. M. D. Corse died at his home in Alexandria on February 11, 1895, following a brief illness. He and his wife are buried in the town's Episcopal Cemetery. His personal and wartime papers are in the special collections of the Alexandria Library.

Playing career Bullock was born in Gorton and after spending his early days playing with Gorton he joined Manchester City in March 1922. He failed to break into City's first team and in February 1924 he moved to Crewe Alexandra in Division Three North. After half a season with Crewe he was signed by Division Two Southampton in August 1924. He remained at Southampton for five years during which he was usually only called upon to play in the first team when either Bill Rawlings or Arthur Dominy were unavailable. In his first three seasons at The Dell he only made fifteen appearances including a spell of ten games in the latter half of the 1925‚Äì26 season when first Dominy and then Rawlings were unavailable in which Bullock scored four goals, including a brace against Derby County on 10 February 1926. In the following season, although Dominy had now moved on to Everton, Bullock was again unable to secure a regular place as Saints had signed Dick Rowley who became the first choice at inside left. Rowley was injured in early December 1927, and after briefly trying Charlie Petrie at inside left, manager Arthur Chadwick moved Rawlings across and played Bullock at centre-forward. Bullock retained the No. 9 shirt for the rest of the season, scoring eight times from seventeen appearances. Despite this relative success he then sat out the whole of the following season in the reserves, with new signings Jerry Mackie and Willie Haines being preferred in the first team. In his five seasons with the Saints, Bullock made only 33 league appearances scoring 13 goals, although he notched up a \\"staggering\\" 166 goals in 208 games for the reserves. In June 1929, he was recommended by former Southampton player Alec Campbell to his successor as manager at Chesterfield, Teddy Davison. Bullock soon became a fixture in the Chesterfield line-up making 39 appearances at centre-forward in his first season scoring 31 goals as his new club finished fourth in the table. During this season, he scored four hat-tricks, including twice against Darlington. This run of form attracted him to several First Division clubs and he was signed by Manchester United in September 1930 for a fee of ¬£1,250. He made ten first team appearances for United but was only able to find the net in one match, although this was a hat-trick on 8 November 1930 at Leicester City (United lost the match 4‚Äì5). United finished the 1930‚Äì31 season at the foot of the table and were relegated to the Second Division. Bullock then moved to Republic of Ireland for a season with Dundalk on a free transfer, followed by a season in Wales with Llanelli. He then returned to Manchester to his final club, Hyde United. He died in Stockport on 9 March 1977.

Since the time it was established, it was one of the centers of Manila's social life. It was the site of many important events in Philippine‚ÄìAmerican relations. The Building The building was designed by William E. Parsons and has his characteristic trademark of the generous use of arches. It was built by the US Army Corps of Engineers. It was completed on April 17, 1911 In his book, McCallus described the current state of the Army and Navy Club as: > a dignified white structure, nearly hidden by beautiful palms and acacia > trees, and guarded by a well-carved wrought iron fence. The original was a > spacious H-shaped affair (...). The club has a reputation of being among the > best of its type in the world with excellent food, a superb staff, and a > swimming pool. It also boasted a bowling alley, tennis and squash courts, > and a huge officer's bar. History Aerial view of the Army and Navy Club, 1930 The Army and Navy Club of Manila was organized in December 1898. The first president was Col. Smith of California.https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1898/12/10/102080731.pdf Notable persons who became its presidents were Adm. George Dewey, Gen. Arthur MacArthur, Jr. and his son Douglas MacArthur, and Leonard Wood. Originally, the club was housed in a building in Intramuros, Manila and then in April, 1911 transferred to its present site near Rizal Park, an area along the shores of Manila Bay reserved by urban planner Daniel Burnham in his plan of Manila. The club shared a lot with the Manila Elks Club, a local branch of the fraternal lodge of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks whose membership was open to civilians and is still operating. Together they were the center of the social life of Americans in Manila for many decades. During the Second World War, it was used as a bomb shelter and evacuation center during attacks by the Japanese Army and it was occupied by the Japanese during the entirety of the Japanese occupation of the Philippines. The building survived the war but its gradual decline began in the 1960s and for a time served as the city architect's office until the building showed signs of crumbling. It was then used as a manufacturing site for the city's Christmas lanterns, thereby contributing more to the building's decay until it was resurrected as the short-lived Museo de Manila. On April 26, 1991, it was declared a National Historical Landmark by the National Historical Institute. In 2007 the then-derelict building was planned to be renovated.Manila‚Äôs Army and Navy Club to be restored In June 2017, the building reopened as the Rizal Park Hotel with the building still retaining the name Manila Army and Navy Club at the facade. Life at the Club During the American colonial period, Filipinos were not allowed in the club as described by a 1922 New York Times article on a speech from Senator Bingham:Bingham on Brownskins > Mr. Bingham's audience [during a speech in Hawaii] was all attention as he > proceeded to relate how, a few weeks previously, he had been invited as > guest of honor to a banquet in the Army & Navy Club of Manila.

The club in the 1930s was described by Aslakson:http://www.lib.noaa.gov/edocs/AslaksonPhilippines.html > The Army and Navy Club had a large veranda on the second floor on one side > which had a long line of bunks side by side the length of the veranda.

Redevelopment For several years after the Museo ng Maynila closed, the Manila Army and Navy Club building was left in a state of disrepair. In 2014, the City of Manila, with the approval of the NHCP entered into a lease agreement with Oceanville Hotel and Spa Corporation for the renovation and use of the building as a five-star hotel. Oceanville then entered into memorandum of agreement with Vanderwood Management Corporation for the sublease of a portion of the building for 20 years for use as a gaming facility, which it then subleased to the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) for 15 years. The redevelopment of the building started in 2014 with Palafox Associates and AMH Philippines being tapped for the design and structural assessment of the building, respectively. After the assessment was completed, work began in the retrofitting of the building's columns using reinforced concrete. It was also decided, with the approval of the NHCP, to remove two annex buildings at the back of the property that were not part of the original building. Debris, including many of the original wrought-iron windows, wrought-iron railings and ceramic floor tiles inside the building, were also cleared, which caused controversy after photos of the clearing operation circulated in social media. On 5 September 2014, the NHCP issued a cease-and- desist order against Oceanville for tampering with the main building without their permission. Oceanville argued that the clearing was done to remove debris that might pose danger to workers on the site. But the NHCP said the developer acted without the agency's approval. Following Oceanville and Palafox Associates' presentation of the final plan for the building, the NHCP withdrew its cease-and-desist order provided that no additional demolition of the building's historical components will be conducted without the agency's approval. By 2015, the redevelopment of the building resumed but it caused controversy again after the engineering firm behind the project cut several old trees located in the site. It drew criticism from heritage conservationists and environmentalists. According to the developer, 31 trees were cut while 13 were earth-balled and replanted in another location, all with the approval of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. The redevelopment of the building reportedly costs P2.4 billion. Reopening The Rizal Park Hotel had its soft opening and grand launch on 26 July 2017. The launch was attended by Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte who, in his speech, said: \\"The American-owned Army and Navy Club, it's now so beautiful, much may be prettier than the original one. What is very consoling is that all of the American properties are already in the hands of the Chinese. Very good.\\" According to Oceanville Hotel and Spa president Cornelio Abdon, the boutique five-star hotel has 110 rooms, categorized as Standard, Deluxe, Junior Suite, Premier Suite, Premier Suite with Ante Room and Army Navy Club Suite. Among the amenities of the hotel include a 300-square meter spa; all- day dining at the hotel's sole restaurant; a coffee shop and a 600-square meter sky bar. It also has an infinity swimming pool at the back, a bakeshop that sells freshly baked pastries, a banquet that can seat 1,200 person and a completely staffed kitchen with 38 chefs.

A graduate of an unknown university, he served his earliest years as a clergyman at St Andrews, moving on to hold churches in Lothian as well as deputising (as Official) to two archdeacons of Lothian. In the late summer and in the autumn of 1296, between the death of Bishop William Fraser and the arrival of the new Bishop of St Andrews William de Lamberton, Nicholas was placed in charge of the diocese of St Andrews as Official. Nicholas thereafter can be found exercising a senior role in Scottish affairs, and by early 1301 he was Chancellor of Scotland. In his late 60s or (more probably) his 70s by this stage, Nicholas was an extremely old man, yet in 1307 he became Bishop of Dunblane. He held this position until his death in either 1319 or 1320. Background and early life Modern ruins of St Andrews Cathedral. Although it is not known where Nicholas attended university, it is known that much of his early life was spent in and around this location. It is highly unlikely that Nicholas was born later than the 1230s, as he was styled Magister by 1259, indicating that by that date he possessed a Master's degree. It was rare for someone under twenty years old or even older to have such a qualification in this period. The university or universities he attended are not known.Shead, \\"Balmyle, Nicholas (d. 1319/20)\\". Until 1295, Nicholas was referred to as Nicholas of St Andrews (de Sancto Andrea), but in February of that year he began to be called de Balmyle, one source referring to him as de Balmyll dictus de Sancto Andrea (de Balmyle called de Sanctoandrea).Watt, Dictionary, p. 23. It is probable that he adopted de Sancto Andrea when he finished training at St Andrews and went elsewhere, and that he dropped it in 1295 when he moved back. Nicholas' apparent surname, de Balmyle, points to an association with Balmyle near Meigle, in the region where Gowrie and Angus border, though that is only one of two possible locations.Shead, \\"Balmyle, Nicholas (d. 1319/20)\\"; Watt, Dictionary, pp. 23-4. Early career As a graduate, Nicholas is first found active at St Andrews in the entourage of Gamelin, Bishop of St Andrews, in 1259. He does not appear very often in any witness lists during the following few decades, but does appear along with other St Andrews clerics witnessing a charter of William, Earl of Mar at Falkland on 21 January 1268. He disappeared from the records until found as Official to the Archdeacon of Lothian (1283 √ó 1285). It is possible that during this period, he left Scotland for further study. The position of Official was held under the absentee Archdeacon of Lothian, Adam de Gullane, and afterwards, Archdeacon William Frere, and was probably held along with the post of vicar of Haddington; the latter he definitely held by 1295.Watt, Dictionary, p. 24; Watt & Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, pp. 400-1. Nicholas is found as Official in a document dating certainly between 1273 and 1285, a document which can probably be more precisely dated to between 1283 and 1285.Namely because one Nicholas de Lochmaben is attested as the Official of the Archdeacon of Lothian in 1283; see Watt, Dictionary, p. 24 & Watt & Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 424. He was pastor of the church of Calder Comitis, Midlothian, by September 1296.Watt, Dictionary, p. 24. Both churches were indirectly under the patronage of the Bishop of St Andrews, William Fraser. The rector of Haddington was St Andrews Cathedral Priory and although the church of Calder Comitis was normally under the patronage of the Mormaer of Fife, at that point in time the wardship of the young mormaer's lands was being held by the Bishop of St Andrews. On 6 November 1292, he acted as a substitute auditor on behalf of John de Balliol at Berwick in the Great Cause.Barrow, Robert Bruce, pp. 60, 119; Watt, Dictionary, p. 24. The latter was the legal process by which Edward I, King of the English, mediated the succession dispute to the Scottish throne, the end result of which Balliol was selected by King Edward to be king on condition of open subordination. Arbroath Abbey in Angus, where Nicholas would have spent much of his time as Chancellor. Nicholas attended King John's first parliament in February 1293 at Scone.Barrow, Robert Bruce, p. 120; Shead, \\"Balmyle, Nicholas (d. 1319/20)\\"; Watt, Dictionary, p. 24. He is found witnessing a charter at Newbattle Abbey on 20 November 1293, as Archdeacon William Frere's Official, and on 20 December is mentioned by Frere as a commissary of the Official of the diocese of St Andrews appointed to adjudicate on 4 January 1294, a case involving Kelso Abbey. He witnessed a charter along with Archdeacon Frere and Bishop William Fraser at Inchmurdo on 13 February 1295. Nicholas and the wars of Scottish independence In 1296, the agreement that had followed from the Great Cause between King Edward I and the King of the Scots, John Balliol, broke down. King Edward resolved to depose King John, invading the kingdom and beginning the Wars of Scottish Independence. Nicholas, as pastor of Calder- Comitis, swore fealty to King Edward at Berwick on 28 August 1296. His lands were restored thereafter, on 2 September, Edward having notionally confiscated all the lands of the Scottish clergy earlier in the year pending homage.Cockburn, Medieval Bishops, p. 87; Watt, Dictionary, p. 24. In the following year, William Fraser, the Bishop of St Andrews, died, and it was Nicholas who was chosen to be Official of the diocese and to administer it during the vacancy. He performed this function until the return to Scotland from France of the new bishop, William de Lamberton.Shead, \\"Balmyle, Nicholas (d. 1319/20)\\"; Watt, Dictionary, p. 24. After his return in August 1299, Lamberton was Guardian of Scotland and Nicholas became his close associate. Nicholas can be seen to have benefited as a result. He became Chancellor of Scotland by 30 January 1301.This is the first point in time in which he is attested in this office; Dowden, Bishops, p. 201; Shead, \\"Balmyle, Nicholas (d. 1319/20)\\"; Watt, Dictionary, p. 24. Balmyle's pension for being Chancellor was to be paid by Arbroath Abbey, for which the abbey later fell into arrears.Barrow, Robert Bruce, pp. 120, 178; Watt, Dictionary, p. 25. Later in the year, in April, he was one of four Scottish envoys sent to Canterbury for abortive talks with the English and French. In the next few years, Nicholas' activities are difficult to trace, but he was probably involved in much diplomatic activity, including perhaps having a hand in drawing up the brief which Baldred Bisset would later deliver to the pope in the interests of Scottish independence. It was probably in this time too that Nicholas became a clerk at Arbroath Abbey and perhaps a canon of Dunblane Cathedral.Watt, Dictionary, pp. 23-4. Nicholas may have remained as Chancellor until 1305. His accession as Chancellor by 1301 corresponded with a renewed emphasis on the authority of King John in government documents. Becoming Chancellor by 1301, in the words of Geoffrey Barrow, meant that he became \\"one of the handful of key men who directed the national struggle\\".Barrow, Robert Bruce, p. 120. Episcopal election Dunblane Cathedral, the seat (cathedra) of Nicholas' bishopric, as it is today. Following the death of his namesake Nicholas, Bishop of Dunblane (and former Abbot of Arbroath), Nicholas de Balmyle was among the canons of Dunblane with the responsibility of selecting a successor. Bishop Nicholas had died sometime between 1306 (after his last attestation on 26 January) and late 1307.Watt & Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 100. The election was done by compromissarii (a short-list of canons delegated to perform election), with John, Abbot of Arbroath excluded from the vote, perhaps because of his known pro-English tendencies.Watt, Dictionary, p. 25. The seven compromissarii were the dean (name not known),Dean John was last attested on 24 August 1302, and was not known to have died, while Dean William de Yetholm is first attested in office on 23 September 1309; see Watt & Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 106. Maurice, Abbot of Inchaffray, William, Abbot of Lindores, Michael, Abbot of Cambuskenneth, William de Eaglesham, Henry de Stirling, and Nicholas de Balmyle.Dowden, Bishops, p. 201. They were instructed to elect from among themselves, and their decision was the promotion of Nicholas de Balmyle.Dowden, Bishops, p. 201; Watt & Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 101. Nicholas, Bishop-elect of Dunblane, travelled to the Apostolic See along with proctors of the cathedral chapter. After the election was confirmed by Pope Clement V, Nicholas was consecrated by Nicholas, Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia at Poitiers on 11 December 1307. It was Geoffrey Barrow's belief, supported by Donald Watt, that their decision was the result of pressure from the new Scottish king, Robert de Brus, who may have valued Balmyle's experience and trusted his political record.Barrow, Robert Bruce, pp. 174, 263; Watt, Dictionary, p. 25. The usual secular patron of the diocese was the Mormaer of Strathearn, but the incumbent Maol √çosa III was at that stage a prisoner-exile at Rochester in England, thus allowing Robert to take his place.Barrow, Robert Bruce, p. 174; Neville, Native Lordship, p. 33; Watt, Dictionary, p. 25. Bishop of Dunblane When Nicholas returned to Scotland, and the exact nature of his activities over the next few years, remain unclear matters. His episcopal rank makes it likely that he attended the parliaments and took part in the affairs of the kingdom during the early years of his episcopate, but direct proof is lacking.Barrow, Robert Bruce, p. 185; Watt, Dictionary, p. 25. He witnessed a charter of Cambuskenneth Abbey along with John de Kininmund, Bishop of Brechin, on 12 September 1311. He is found witnessing many ecclesiastical and royal documents through 1312, 1313 and beyond. He witnessed royal acts at Inchture and Dundee in April 1312, at Ayr on 27 May 1315, at Edinburgh on 9 March 1317, at Scone on 14 June that year, at Melrose on 24 July 1317, again at Scone on 3 December 1318 and at Arbroath on 8 February 1319. On 6 October 1312, he came to an agreement with Bernard, Abbot of Arbroath, which resolved Nicholas' complaints concerning the non payment of his pension as well as more official disputes between the bishopric of Dunblane and the abbey. In the following year he was in a dispute with Dunfermline Abbey regarding the church of Logie-Atheron in Stirlingshire, a dispute which was never resolved during Nicholas' episcopate. On 9 May 1315, he is found at Perth assisting William de Sinclair, Bishop of Dunkeld, in a judgment regarding Donnchadh de Strathearn. On 27 March 1318 he was named as papal mandatory to oversee the provision of the Italian Robert Barducii of Florence to the deanery of Glasgow Cathedral.Cockburn, Medieval Bishops, pp. 87-8; Watt, Dictionary, p. 25; Watt & Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 198. It is not known exactly when Bishop Nicholas died. The see of Dunblane is first known to have been vacant on 30 January 1320 and Bishop Nicholas' last appearance in the records was witnessing a charter of Coupar Angus Abbey at Arbroath on 8 February 1319: his death therefore fell between these two points.Cockburn, Medieval Bishops, p. 90; Watt, Dictionary, p. 25; Watt & Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 101.

Other interests are: BASE jumping, wingsuiting, skydiving, surfing, skateboarding, trail running, mountain biking and snowboarding. Ammon has been the conductor of many ascents on El Capitan, most of them in a day (under 24 hrs): Plastic Surgery Disaster, Wall of the Early Morning Light, Atlantic Ocean Wall, and most recent climbing one of the hardest routes on El Capitan, The Reticent Wall along with Dean Potter & Ivo Ninov in 34 hours and 57 minutes, shaving the existing time by more than five days. He is recognized as having climbed El Capitan by the most number of different routes - 75 times via 61 routes. McNeely is the first (Nate Brown is the only other one) to have climbed all three routes on The Streaked Wall in Zion National Park, ascending all three routes with a First One Day Ascent. Ammon is also a slackliner and pioneered many highlines throughout the US and has opened up new BASE jumps, as well. In October 2013, Ammon nearly lost his foot in a BASE accident in Moab that he described as: \\"We were with one other jumper who was new, and I voted that Andy goes first, the two new guys go in the middle, and I go last. They had perfect exits, great openings with no wind. I jumped, probably took a tad longer delay than I should have, being it was a new exit with new brake lines, and immediately had a 180-degree opening.

He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1850. Ransom was assigned to the 1st dragoons on July 1, 1850. He attended the cavalry school at Carlisle Barracks in Carlisle, Pennsylvania in 1850-51. On October 9, 1851 he was promoted to Second Lieutenant. Ransom then performed frontier service in New Mexico from 1851-54. Ransom married Minnie Huntt in 1854. He was assistant instructor of cavalry tactics at West Point from 1854-55. In 1855 he was promoted to First Lieutenant and transferred to the 1st U.S. Cavalry. Ransom served as adjutant of the regiment at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas from 1855‚Äì1857, where he took part in the Sioux expedition and in policing the Kansas disturbances. The next few years saw him in the recruiting service and frontier duty in Arkansas, Kansas and Colorado. He was also promoted to Captain. He resigned his commission on January 31, 1861, with the discussion of secession and the sectional crisis that led to the Civil War. Civil War He was initially appointed as a captain in the North Carolina cavalry in early 1861 and served with his regiment in Northern Virginia, where he fought in several minor skirmishes. On October 13, 1861, he was appointed to the colonelcy of the 1st North Carolina Cavalry Regiment. He commanded the Confederate forces at the skirmish around Vienna on November 26, 1861, and was afterward returned to North Carolina. On March 1, 1862, Ransom was promoted to brigadier general and fought on the Peninsula attached to Huger's Division. He led his North Carolina brigade in the September 1862 invasion of Maryland and participated in the capture of Harpers Ferry and the Battle of Antietam. On November 7, he was placed in temporary command of the division and led it through the Battle of Fredericksburg, where Ransom's division had successfully defended Marye's Heights against the attacking Federals. In January 1863, Ransom and his brigade were sent back to North Carolina. In May he was promoted to major general and performed duty around Richmond, western Virginia, and eastern Tennessee. In May 1864 he led a division under General P.G.T. Beauregard in the defense of Drewry's Bluff against Union General Benjamin Butler. He was sent to command the cavalry in the Shenandoah Valley in the summer, under the command of General Jubal A. Early, where he participated in the battles of Monocacy and Fort Stevens. He was relieved of command in August 1864 due to illness and never returned to front line service. He ended the war serving on military courts at administrative posts in Kentucky and at Charleston, South Carolina, before surrendering to Federal troops on May 2, 1865.Sifakis, Who Was Who in the Confederacy Postbellum career Following the war, he was an express agent and city marshal at Wilmington, North Carolina, and then was a farmer until 1878.

Early life Stepan Fedak was the son of a prominent Lw√≥w attorney and Ukrainian activist, Dr. Stepan Fedak. The younger Fedak was a graduate of the Austro-Hungarian Military Academy at Wiener Neustadt. He served in the Legion of Ukrainian Sich Rifles, then in the Ukrainian Galician Army and the Army of the Ukrainian People's Republic. In 1920 he joined the clandestine Ukrainian Military Organization. Fedak was also a member of the secret Committee of Ukrainian Youth and of Volia, an underground militant organization of Ukrainian students and ex-officers of the Ukrainian Galician Army whose purpose was to fight for an independent Ukraine. It was steered from abroad by Colonel Yevhen Konovalets' Ukrainian Military Organization, acting in Czechoslovakia and Germany. The Ukrainian Military Organization planned to organize underground attacks and sabotage in southeastern Poland, with its majority-Ukrainian population, to be followed by open warfare conducted by the Ukrainians against Poland and the Soviet Union until an independent Ukrainian state was reestablished in southeastern Poland and Dnieper Ukraine (Great Ukraine). Assassination plot A meeting of Lw√≥w Volia members decided to assassinate Polish Chief of State Marshal J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski during his planned visit to Lw√≥w on September 25, 1921, to help open the first Eastern Trade Fair. The conspirators had detailed information about his visit to the city. Volia divided itself into five-man groups, one of which was to carry out the assassination. The actual assassin, chosen by lot, was Stepan Fedak. Furnished with a false passport and German visa, immediately after the operation he was to escape to Berlin. He was to be assisted by the remaining members of his group. Paliyiv, a law student, was to stand beside Fedak and, after Fedak had fired, overpower him and summon police. Another conspirator, disguised as a Polish Army major, would hasten to assist. The two would conduct Fedak out of the crowd, get into a rented automobile with him, and ostensibly drive him off to jail, but actually out of town. The attack Having earlier that day participated in the opening of the Trade Fair and then met with bankers, journalists and civic leaders, about 8 p.m. Pi≈Çsudski left the city hall, accompanied by Lw√≥w Province Governor Kazimierz Grabowski. They got into an open limousine, with Pi≈Çsudski seated on the left. Stepan Fedak pushed his way toward them through the crowd. The car was moving very slowly, when a loud noise rang out. The Governor, sure that it was a back-fire, continued sitting upright; Pi≈Çsudski, however, immediately recognized it for a pistol shot and reflexively ducked. The bullet had just missed him by a hair and struck the windshield. Two more shots rang out. One struck the Governor's right shoulder, the other‚Äîhis left arm. The Governor slipped off his seat, and was supported by Pi≈Çsudski. Police senior constable Jakub Skweres threw himself at Fedak and seized him by the throat. Fedak, as he fell, fired a fourth round, wounding himself in the chest. The crowd pounced on him; he was saved from certain death by policemen and soldiers of the guard standing before the city hall, who knocked the would-be lynchers aside with their rifle butts. Aftermath The Governor was treated by physicians and went home, while Pi≈Çsudski, as planned, proceeded to Lw√≥w's Great Theater, where he received an ovation from the gathered public. The wounded and badly contused Fedak was taken under police escort to a hospital. Immediately interrogated by the police, he falsely stated that he had wanted to shoot only the Governor, who was an enemy of the Ukrainian people, and had planned to then hand his pistol over to Chief of State Pi≈Çsudski. After the performance at the Great Theater, a banquet was held at the provincial administrative offices, with the wounded Governor Grabowski in attendance. Fedak subsequently escaped abroad. Toward the end of World War II he disappeared without trace in Berlin. References * W≈Çodzimierz Kalicki, \\"25 IX 1921.

It was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novelette in 1987 and also won a Locus Award in 1987 in the novelette category. The graphic novel The Life Eaters is based on the story. This story was first published in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction in their July 1986 issue; it was later reprinted in the anthology Hitler Victorious. The title is a reference to the Marvel Comics characters Thor and Captain America. Plot summary Just as World War II began to turn against them, Nazi Germany is suddenly aided by the Norse pantheon. However, Loki joins the Allies, and they prepare a last-ditch sneak attack against Valhalla called Operation Ragnarok. The story follows Captain Chris Turing, who is part of the team which is going to attack Valhalla and starts out with them traveling to their attack destination in a group of submarines hoping that what remained of the United States Surface Navy would be able to distract the Nazi and Norse pantheon forces. Originally the plan was to include only Chris' team and their commando escorts, but Loki informs them that he will accompany his troops to Gotland as well. Due to Loki's previous actions in aiding the Allies and the way he ended the Holocaust by saving the inmates of the concentration camps, Chris agrees and convinces Major Marlowe to allow it. While waiting for them to get to their destination, Chris recollects his memory of World War II and how the Nazi Germany was about to be defeated by the allied forces until they received the aid of the Norse pantheon. Loki notices Chris and allows the captain to ask the Norse God three questions. Loki answers the questions asked, and in one answer mentions how he does not think that he is older than Chris and also implies that the Nazi extermination camps were established for reasons other than for \\"Nazi racial purification\\", but refuses to answer any further questions to clarify this. The group arrives at Gotland, and during the operation Loki disappears as √Üsir forces led by Thor defeats the troops. The survivors of Operation Ragnarok are taken prisoner after the failed mission and are given to Thor by his father Odin. While in custody, Chris recollects more of his memories of World War II and recalls how as a child he wished that he would have an event like the war that he could partake in like his father did. He ends up discussing the history of World War II with his captured troops, and argues with the group about the suggestion the United States should have simply bombed Germany in order to end the war as soon as possible. He also takes an opportunity to mock one of his human captors about how the Nazis have become mere puppets of the √Üsir. After these conversations, Chris is taken to be interrogated by Thor. Thor tries to get Chris to reveal the whereabouts of Loki, but the captive captain does not tell him and does not know. Chris ends up insulting Thor, insisting that they are aliens, and as a result Thor orders his death before revealing that the Norse pantheon were invited \\"upon the wings of death itself.\\" O'Leary later tells Chris that he was told by Loki to give Chris an answer to his final question: necromancy. Chris realizes that the death camps were built not for \\"racial purification\\", but for human sacrifices to fuel magic. The captain also realizes that the Norse Gods were created by necromancy due to Loki's admission that he is actually young. After realizing that he has gained superhuman powers from Loki, Chris attacks the guards and dies in an attempt to resist the Norse Gods after managing to destroy Odin's Spear. In doing so, he hopes that his actions will give hope to other heroes who will eventually rise up to overcome the Nazis. Author's notes In the author's notes for this story, David Brin records that he was invited by Gregory Benford to write a piece for an alternate history collection, entitled Hitler Victorious, but voiced the opinion that he could not think of a single event which, if altered, would have let the Nazis win the war, and, contrariwise, that they had required a number of lucky breaks to get as far as they did (see also: alien space bats). Benford‚Äôs reply was ‚ÄúI bet you could think of some premise that would work, David‚Äù. This story was the result.Brin, D The River of Time (1987) p238 Brin also notes in the afterwards of his story that he wrote this story as a possible explanation for why the Nazis \\"do so many horrible, pointless things\\".

The PIGA's main use is in Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) for guidance of aircraft and most particularly for ballistic missile guidance. It is valued for its extremely high sensitivity and accuracy in conjunction with operation over a wide acceleration range. The PIGA is still considered the premier instrument for strategic grade missile guidance, though systems based on MEMS technology are attractive for lower performance requirements. Principle of operation The sensing element of a PIGA is a pendulous mass, free to pivot by being mounted on a bearing. A spinning gyroscope is attached such that it would restrain the pendulum against \\"falling\\" in the direction of acceleration. The pendulous mass and its attached gyroscope are themselves mounted on a pedestal that can be rotated by an electric torque motor. The rotational axis of this pedestal is mutually orthogonal to the spin axis of the gyroscope as well as the axis that the pendulum is free to move in. The axis of rotation of this pedestal is also in the direction of the measured acceleration. The position of the pendulum is sensed by precision electrical contacts or by optical or electromagnetic means. Should acceleration displace the pendulum arm from its null position the sensing mechanism will operate the torque motor and rotate the pedestal such that the property of gyroscopic precession restores the pendulum to its null position. The rate of rotation of the pedestal gives the acceleration while the total number of rotations of the shaft gives the speed, hence the term \\"integrating\\" in the PIGA acronym. A further level of integration of shaft rotations by either electronic means or by mechanical means, such as a Ball-and-disk integrator, can record the displacement or distance traveled, this latter mechanical method being used by early guidance systems prior to the availability of suitable digital computers. In most implementations of the PIGA the gyroscope itself is cantilevered on the end of the pendulum arm to act as the pendulous mass itself. Up to three such instruments may be required for each dimension of an INS with the three accelerometers mounted orthogonally generally on a platform stabilized gyroscopically within a system of gimbals. Image:PIGA_accelerometer_1.png A critical requirement for accuracy is low static friction (stiction) in the bearings of the pendulum; this is achieved by various means ranging from double ball bearing with a superimposed oscillatory motion to dither the bearing above its threshold or through the use of gaseous or fluid bearings or by the alternative method of floating the gyroscope in a fluid and restraining the residual mass by jewel bearings or electromagnetic means. Although this later method still has the viscous friction of the fluid this is linear and has no threshold and has the advantage of having minimal static friction. Another aspect is the accurate control of the gyroscope's rotational rate. Missiles using PIGAs were the Polaris, Titan, Redstone, Jupiter, Saturn Series and MX Peacekeeper. History The PIGA was based on an accelerometer developed by Dr. Fritz Mueller, then of the Kreiselgeraete Company, for the LEV-3 and experimental SG-66 guidance system of the Nazi era German V2 (EMW A4) ballistic missile and was known among the German rocket scientists as the MMIA \\"Mueller Mechanical Integrating Accelerometer\\". This system used precision electrical contacts to actuate the torque motor and achieved an accuracy of 1 part in 1000 to 1 part per 10000 known in technical parlance as a scale error of 1000 to 100. This was equivalent to about 600m of accuracy over the V2 1500m/s speed and 320km flight. Since the number of shaft rotations represented speed, a Cam Switch was used to initiate missile control sequences such as engine throttle-down and shut-off. PIGA accelerometers mounted in the AIRS (Advanced Inertial Reference Sphere) are part of most accurate inertial navigation (INS) developed for the MX Missile. The INS drift rates are less than 1.5 x 10‚àí5 degrees per hour of operation, about 8.5m per hour with the overall accuracy of the missile affected more by defects in the gravitational maps. A recovered MMIA accelerometer from an unexploded V2 was presented to Dr Charles Stark Draper of the United States's MIT instrumentation lab who had been developing the basis of inertial navigation for aircraft by initially concentrating efforts on achieving extremely low drift rate gyroscopes known as a floated integrating gyroscope. Draper combined ideas from his integrating gyroscopes, which were mounted in cans that floated in fluids that were held in place by jeweled bearings, with the recovered V2 accelerometer by floating the pendulum-gyroscope portion. The more generic name of PIGA was suggested by Dr Draper due to the addition of various refinements such as electromagnetic or optical sensing of pendulum position. Such accelerometers were used in the Titan II and Polaris Systems and Minuteman systems. At the Redstone Arsenal and the adjoining Marshall Space Flight Center, near Huntsville Alabama the contingent of ex-German rocket scientists which had been brought into the United States under Operation Paperclip, including Dr Mueller, continued to refine their original instruments in conjunction with American engineers and scientists. At the suggestion of Dr Mueller, the technically difficult task of replacing the original ball bearings with gaseous bearings was achieved. Initially compressed nitrogen was used but later fluorocarbons which had the advantage of being recyclable on board the missile or aircraft during extended waiting periods was used. Hence US accelerometers either consisted of the floated type or the gaseous bearing type with the US Army and US Space program relying on the later type of instrument.

The song is also known by its opening line, \\"What Kind of Shoes You Gwine (Going) To Wear\\". The song became the basis for a minstrel show parody song, \\"Oh, Dem Golden Slippers\\", which itself became an American musical standard. The parody song is also frequently referred to as \\"Golden Slippers\\".  Song  As presented in its earliest recordings, \\"Golden Slippers\\" is a stirring and proud song, considerably different than its rather jaunty parody. In it, the lead singer asks the choir what kind of finery they will wear in going to join the Heavenly choir. The lyrics for the first stanza are: What kind of shoes you goin‚Äô to wear? / Golden slippers! / What kind of shoes you goin‚Äô to wear? / Golden slippers! Golden slippers I‚Äôm bound to wear, / To outshine the glittering sun. / Oh, yes, yes, yes my Lord, / I‚Äôm going to join the Heavenly choir. / Yes, yes, yes my Lord, / Soldier of the cross. Although there are variations between existing recordings, subsequent stanzas involve a \\"long white robe\\" (as in \\"Oh, Dem Golden Slippers\\"), a \\"starry crown\\", a \\"new song\\", and a \\"golden harp\\". Over the first half of the twentieth century, various recordings of the song as \\"Golden Slippers\\" were made by the Fisk Jubilee Singers, the Golden Echo Quartet, the Tuskegee Institute (University) Singers, Wood's Famous Blind Jubilee Singers & Cotton Belt Quartet, and the Wiseman Quartet. As \\"What Kind Of Shoes You Gwine To Wear\\", the song was recorded in the late 1920s with a considerably different up-tempo melody and playful arrangement by William Rexroat and his Cedar Crest Singers. As the chorus sings each of the questions and responses, the lead singer interjects a smart-aleck answer before joining with them. (An example: \\"I'm goin' to wear my old work shoes!\\" to \\"What kind of shoes you gwine to wear, golden shoes\\".) A performance of this latter arrangement appeared on the 1973 folk album \\"Lonesome Robin\\" by Bob Coltman, as \\"What Kind of Shoes\\".

He was most prominent in the Confederate service in the American Civil War as commander of the Washington Artillery out of New Orleans and as Inspector-General of Field Artillery of the Confederate States, the highest position an artillery officer could achieve. He was a descendant of signer of the Declaration of Independence, George Walton. Early life Born in New Jersey, Walton attended college in Louisiana and owned a New Orleans grocery store. Military service=Mexican American War= Walton joined the Washington Artillery as an adjutant when the unit was formed in 1839. In the Mexican War, Walton commanded the 1st Louisiana Artillery as a Major and by 1857 he was Colonel Commanding of the battalion.Antietam on the Web =Civil War= At the outbreak of the Civil War, Walton and four of five batteries went East to serve in Virginia. After fighting at the First Battle of Manassas, Walton and his command were assigned to James Longstreet's forces. These batteries served in the Peninsula Campaign, at Second Manassas, and Antietam. Walton commanded the batteries on Marye's Heights during the Battle of Fredericksburg and the Chancellorsville Campaign. He commanded the artillery reserve of the First Corps artillery and was offended when at Gettysburg a subordinate Colonel E. Porter Alexander was placed in charge of the artillery preparation for Pickett's Charge on July 3, 1863. When the bulk of Longstreet's First Corps were sent to Georgia (United States), only a portion of the artillery was sent with it. Walton held several positions in southern Virginia during the absence of his guns.

He specialized in wedding photography, entering it as a profession in 1947. In the 1970s he operated a studio in Silver Spring, Maryland. Later he lived in Florida. He was Brides Magazine's Wedding Photographer of the Year for 1990 and United Nations Photographer of the Year for 2002,Yvonne Shinhoster Lamb, \\"Monte Zucker; 'Prince' Of Wedding Portraiture\\", Washington Post, March 27, 2007. and one of Canon's \\"Explorers of Light\\". Additionally, he was a prolific author and teacher, with monthly columns in magazines such as Shutterbug. Several manufacturers made equipment bearing his name, most notably Westcott's \\"Monte Reflector\\" and ALM's \\"Monte Zucker Pneumatic Posing Stool\\". Unlike many photographers of his generation, he readily embraced new technology, particularly digital photography and Adobe Photoshop, featuring digital techniques in his columns right up until the end of his life, and relating them to earlier methods. He did a series of traveling workshops taught by himself and Eddie Tapp, who covered Photoshop techniques. Quotations He noted in one column that one of his maxims was \\"See the finished picture before you even snap the shutter!\\", repeated at each of three training seminars attended by, amongst others, British photographer Barney Douglas, in the United Kingdom in the late 1980s, but at the same time he stated of a digitally retouched image, \\"Did I have this in mind when I first created the image? Yes and no. I wanted to create something artistic, something special. Did I know how I was going to do it? Not really.\\" \\"If you like the way it looks, go with it! I liked it and I did it! Of course, it takes a lot of experience to develop good taste. When one is just starting out it's easy to like something without knowing if it's really good or not. That works some of the time, but an educated opinion usually works better.\\" Early career Monte Zucker started doing photography in high school in Washington, D.C., shooting for friends who remained loyal clients over the years as they became successful and affluent professionals and businessmen. By the early 1970s he had specialized in wedding photography, working almost exclusively for the most affluent members of the Jewish community in the Washington, D.C. area, primarily shooting weddings and bar mitzvahs. Innovator In the 1960s most formal portraits were taken with large cumbersome pack and head flash units, with wedding reception \\"candid\\" photos taken with a single flash on camera and dimensionally flat lighting. What set Monte's work apart from his peers was the innovative use of daylight from a north-facing window and a reflector for his formal posed portraits using backgrounds he had hand-painted on linen roll-up window shades to mimic the look of Old Master painters. He cleverly marketed this style as an \\"Old Master Style\\" which appealed to his niche market. By the late 1960s color had started replacing black and white for shooting weddings, and electronic flash guns replaced flash bulbs. A technical shortcoming of color was a much shorter range on the prints which could not reproduce the full range of detail in a photograph containing a bride in white dress standing with the groom in a black suit when a single flash on camera was used. Familiar with conventional studio lighting, thanks in part to training with New Jersey photographer Joe Zeltsman, Monte understood that the solution to the shorter range film was to control the range of the scene with two lights; one off camera for modeling (key light), over a foundation of even centered light (fill) to control the tone of the shadows. With the invention of the photo-cell trigger which allowed wireless firing of the off-camera \\"key\\" flash, Monte utilized the technology to create studio-like lighting \\"on the fly\\" at wedding receptions using two identical direct flash units, one mounted over the camera as fill to control the shadow tone and a second optically triggered key light for 3D modeling which he mounted on a rolling converted medical IV stand, a clever solution to the logistics of working with the off-camera light. The difference in the realism of the photos both in tonal range and 3D modeling that dual-flash candid shooting provided revolutionized wedding photography and created a new career for Monte teaching others how to duplicate his style. His style was characterized by precise control of lighting pattern and facial angles in every \\"candid\\" reception shot. Technically it gave them a three-dimensional quality and full rich tonal range that the work of his contemporaries lacked, but more importantly his photographs always flattered the subjects, even in something as mundane as a group shot of guests. Monte also was innovative in his approach to covering a wedding. Rather than trying to photograph the live action of the ceremony under unflattering available light he would instead, by prior arrangement, recreate all the traditional parts of the ceremony afterwards using carefully controlled dual-flash lighting and poses while the guests were en route to the reception. When combined with the other window and dual flash photos in the leather-bound album, the finished product had the polished look of a Hollywood movie. Logistically the decision to use window lighting and portable flash was also innovative and brilliant. By using window light he was able to set up and shoot anywhere during the day with a minimum of equipment. Not needing a \\"brick and mortar\\" studio allowed him to work for many years out of his Silver Spring home with just a reception area and room for meeting clients which lowered his overhead. Monte later opened studios in a high-end department store, shopping mall and other locations and switched to using studio flash rather than window light. He continued to innovate, setting up his studio with identical \\"key\\" and \\"hair\\" lights on both sides of the room allowing a subject to be faced right or left, depending on their most flattering side, without the need to move the lighting gear‚Äîanother example of his \\"keep it simple\\" approach to the technical part of the craft. It also likely convinced other photographers to equip their studios similarly, which no doubt pleased his studio lighting equipment sponsor. Intuitive marketing genius Monte was highly regarded by others in wedding-related businesses due to his practice of routinely photographing flower arrangements, the wedding cake, food buffets, and the band in action at weddings and sending the vendors free prints to show off their work. He took the extra step of identically matting and framing the prints to make it easy for the vendors to hang them up. It was an example of Monte's intuitive marketing acumen because very top-end wedding business in the Washington area had a \\"Monte Wall\\" with his name gold foil stamped in the corner of every photo, which generated enthusiastic referrals. Second career as a teacher In the 1960s most wedding photographers were members of the Professional Photographers of America (PPofA), which regularly held print competitions at meetings and conventions. Monte, with his innovative combination of window lighting and dual flash, started winning competitions at the state and national levels in the \\"Candid\\" category of the competitions, which gave him recognition beyond his small niche market. Awards in competition led to offers to teach at PPofA events and training seminars, and to writing a column on wedding photography he called \\"Candid Comments\\" in the PPofA magazine. He also attracted the support of sponsors such as Rolleiflex (whose cameras he used at the time) and Meisel Photo Labs (which he used for his own work). Monte's teaching style was based on the idea of keeping the technical side of wedding photography simple to the point of being instinctive and effortless, allowing the photographer to focus 100% of their attention on interaction with the clients and putting them at ease. For example, to get perfect full-range lighting ratios in candid reception shots he used identical flash units controlling the ratio and keeping it consist by controlling distance. If shooting from the off-camera flash would be placed at . When moving in to 8 ft, the off-camera flash would be rolled to , keeping the ratio the same with the aperture closed 1/stop to keep exposure the same. Moving in to for a close-up, the photographer moved the light to and closed the aperture another stop. With that simple-to-grasp technique it was possible to capture every shot at a wedding reception with stunning 3D and perfectly controlled ratios and exposure as instinctively as focusing the camera. Devising similar easy to learn \\"1-2-3\\" techniques for posing people and finding the most flattering facial angles allowed Mr. Zucker to effectively teach complex topics like lighting and posing at large venues like a PPofA National convention to an audience of hundreds in a way they could later go home and duplicate successfully. That made him very popular as a speaker and instructor but also opened him up to criticism by some as having a rigid, non-creative, rule-based \\"paint by numbers\\" or \\"cookie-cutter\\" approach. But in the context of wedding photography where the goal is to flatter the couple and guest, and there is often one chance to capture action, that was a formula for predictable flattering results and a satisfied client. Later years An irony of becoming recognized and very successful for having a distinctive style in a niche market like weddings is that clients, both photographic and students, wanted his trademark style, making it difficult to stray too far from it. Monte's decision to retire from the wedding business and relocate to Florida in the 1990s was liberating for him creatively because it freed him from the constraint of his classic wedding style and coincided with the innovations of digital photography and the Internet. He embraced both with the same enthusiasm and lack of creative restraints he had as a teenager discovering photography for the first time, and shared his experiences with others via Zuga.net, a website collaboration with a former full-time assistant Gary Bernstein who had struck out on his own in 1972 and become a recognized fashion and celebrity photographer and author. His \\"retirement\\" was short- lived, and up to the time of his death he remained a popular speaker and teacher, sharing his enthusiasm for the new digital capture and editing medium without the creative restraint of the conventional style of portraiture and wedding coverage which had made him a renowned photographer who was universally recognized by just his first name. Personal life Unusually for a photography magazine columnist, Zucker mentioned aspects of his personal life in his columns, including his diagnosis of terminal cancer. Shortly after the diagnosis, he arranged a four-generation photo session that included himself, his children, grandchildren, and a great-grandchild, and photos from that session appeared in his Shutterbug column. His marriage to Sondra Wool Zucker ended in divorce. Zucker always recognized his Homosexuality after his divorce. Survivors include two daughters, Tammi Reitzel of Greensboro, N.C., and Sherri Heller of the District; a brother, Seymore Zucker of Greenbelt; two grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter. At the age of 77 Zucker died from pancreatic cancer at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

It is commonly used, albeit on a small scale, for the removal of organic waste from aquariums; these units are known as \\"protein skimmers\\". However it has much broader application in the chemical process industry and can be used for the removal of surface active contaminants from waste water streams in addition to the enrichment of bio-products. History Whilst protein skimmers have been common place in aquaria for many years, it was not until the 1960s that a concerted effort was made by Robert Lemlich of the University of CincinnatiLemlich R, Lavi E 1961 Foam fractionation with reflux, Science 134, p.191Lemlich R 1968 Adsorptive bubble separation techniques: Foam fractionation and allied techniques, Industrial & Engineering Chemistry 60 p.16 to characterise a model of adsorptive bubble separation processes, of which foam fractionation is one example. Until the mid-2000s, there was very little further development of foam fractionation or attempts to understand the underlying physics of the process. Many workers were satisfied with empirical descriptions of specific systems rather than attempt a mechanistic model of the process, and it is possibly for this reason that the adoption of the technology has been slow despite its enormous potential. Foam fractionation is closely related to the allied process of froth flotation in which hydrophobic particles attach to the surface of bubbles which rise to form a pneumatic (i.e. rising) foam. In this way, relatively hydrophobic particles can be separated from relatively hydrophilic particles. Froth flotation is typically used to separate coal particles from ash or particles of valuable minerals from gangue material. It was research into the froth phase of froth flotation conducted at the University of Newcastle, Australia, specifically into the prediction of liquid fraction and liquid flux in a pneumatic foam, that enabled a preliminary mechanistic description of foam fractionation.Stevenson P, Jameson GJ 2007 Modeling continuous foam fractionation with reflux, Chemical Engineering and Processing 39, p.590 The synergies between foam fractionation and froth flotation have been explored in a 2009 special issue of the Asia Pacific Journal of Chemical Engineering. Design considerations Robert Lemlich showed how foam fractionation columns can be operated in stripping, enriching, or combined modes (depending on whether the feed is sent to the top, bottom or middle of the column), and can be operated with or without an external reflux stream at the top of the column. It helps to think of the process as similar to a gas-liquid absorption column. The differences are that: #The target molecules adsorb to a surface, rather than absorb by travelling into the bulk of one phase from another, and #The foam autogenously provides the packing within the column. Just as in gas-liquid absorption, the adoption of reflux at the top of the column can engender multiple equilibrium stages within the column. However, if one can control the rate at which the bubble size changes with height in the column, either by coalescence or Ostwald ripening, one can engineer an internal source of reflux within the column. As in many chemical processes, there are competing considerations of recovery (i.e. the percentage of target surfactant that reports to the overhead foamate stream) and enrichment (i.e. the ratio of surfactant concentration in the foamate to the concentration in the feed). A crude method of moving upon the enrichment-recovery spectrum is to control the gas rate to the column. A higher gas rate will mean higher recovery but lower enrichment. Foam fractionation proceeds via two mechanisms: #The target molecule adsorbs to a bubble surface, and #The bubbles form a foam which travels up a column and is discharged to the foamate stream of foam fractionation. The rate at which certain non-ionic molecules can adsorb to bubble surface can be estimated by solving the Ward-Tordai equation.Ward AFH & Tordai L 1946 Time- Dependence of boundary tension of solutions I. the role of diffusion in time- effects, Journal of Chemical Physics 14, p.453 The enrichment and recovery depend on the hydrodynamic condition of the rising foam, which is a complex system dependent upon bubble size distribution, stress state at the gas-liquid interface, rate of bubble coalescence, gas rate inter alia. The hydrodynamic condition is described by the Hydrodynamic Theory of Rising Foam.Stevenson P 2007 Hydrodynamic theory of rising foam, Minerals Engineering 20, p.282 Applications #Enrichment of the solutions of biomolecules in pharmaceutical and food technologies. #Stripping of surface-active contaminants from streams of waste water. #Stripping of non-surface-active contaminants from streams of waste water (such as metal ions) with the help of one or more assistant surfactants. #The removal of frother downstream of froth flotation operations (known as frother stripping).

Photo comics are a form of sequential storytelling that uses photographs rather than illustrations for the images, along with the usual comics conventions of narrative text and word balloons containing dialogue. They are sometimes referred to in English as fumetti, photonovels, and similar terms. The photographs may be of real people in staged scenes, or posed dolls and other toys on sets. Although far less common than illustrated comics, photo comics have filled certain niches in various places and times. For example, they have been used to adapt popular film and television works into print, tell original melodramas, and provide medical education. Photo comics have been popular at times in Italy and Latin America, and to a lesser extent in English-speaking countries. Terminology The terminology used to describe photo comics is somewhat inconsistent and idiosyncratic. Fumetti is an Italian word (literally \\"little puffs of smoke\\", in reference to word balloons), which refers in that language to any kind of comics. Because of the popularity of photo comics in Italy, fumetti became a loanword in English referring specifically to that technique. By extension, comics which use a mixture of photographic and illustrated imagery have been described as mezzo- fumetti (\\"half\\" fumetti). Meanwhile, the Spanish term fotonovela ‚Äì referring to popular photo-comics melodramas in Latin America ‚Äì was adapted in English as fotonovel or photonovel, and came to be associated primarily with film and television adaptations, which were marketed using those terms. Variations such as \\"photo funnies\\" and \\"photostories\\" have also been used. In Italian, a photo comic is referred to as a fotoromanzo (\\"photonovel\\", plural: fotoromanzi). In Spanish-speaking countries, the term fotonovela refers to several genres of photo comics, including original melodramas. History There were attempts at photo comics in the early days of tabloids in the United States; as early as 1927 the New York Daily News featured Ziegfeld Follies stars Eddie Cantor and Frances Upton appearing in sequential photographs, telling jokes (presumably from the _Follies_ scripts) with speech bubbles superimposed.New York Daily News, December 13, 1927, p. 32 Cover of an issue of Killing Photo comics emerged in Italy in the 1940s and expanded into the 1950s. (Actress Sophia Loren worked for a time as a model.) The lurid Italian crime photo comic Killing ran from 1966 through 1969, and was reprinted in other countries; it has been reprinted and revived numerous times since then. The technique spread to Latin America, first adapting popular films, then for original stories. By the 1960s, there were about two dozen fotonovela movie adaptations circulating in Latin America and nearly three times as many original works. They remained popular in Mexico into the late 1980s, when 70 million copies of fotonovelas were printed each month. Photo comics first became successful in the United States and Canada with Harvey Kurtzman's Help! magazine, which ran humorous photo stories from 1960 to 1965. Similar \\"Foto Funnies\\" ‚Äì often featuring female nudity ‚Äì were a regular feature of National Lampoon magazine beginning in the early 1970s. During the 1970s, lines of American paperback books were marketed as \\"Fotonovels\\" and \\"Photostories\\", adapting popular films and television shows. Although home video largely supplanted this market in the 1980s, a small number of photo comic adaptations continued to be produced as promotional tie-ins to the original work. Photo comics were common in British magazines such as Jackie in the 1980s, and a few are still published. There are a number of photo newspaper strips in the UK and the form was popular in girl's comics in the 1980s. Boy's comics of the early 1980s such as Load Runner and the relaunched Eagle also experimented with photo comics but without much success; when the Eagle was revamped, former photo comic strips such as Doomlord continued as illustrated strips. Online series such as Night Zero, A Softer World, and Alien Loves Predator are more recent examples of photo comics. In 2007, the Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards gave the first award for \\"Outstanding Photographic Comic\\". In 2010 and 2011 the bilingual photo comic Union of Heroes was nominated for the \\"Web- Sonderman\\"-Awards for the best German webcomic. In the 2010s, cartoonist John Byrne ‚Äì inspired by 1970s photo comics adaptations of Star Trek episodes ‚Äì produced a series of \\"photonovel adventures\\" which combined stills from the series with original digitally-rendered background illustrations and new dialogue, to produce new stories featuring the characters. Software applications such as Comic Life, Comic Strip It, and Strip Designer, which allow users to add word balloons and sound effects to their personal photos and incorporate them into storytelling layouts, have revived some interest in the medium.  Common genres = TV and movie adaptations = In the United States, one of the common uses of photo comics has been TV and film adaptations, usually abridged for length. Still frames from the film or video are reproduced, often in simple grids but sometimes with creative layouts and cropping, overlaid with balloons with abbreviated dialogue from the screenplays. They are a cost-effective way to adapt films and TV series into comics without the expense of commissioning illustrations, and were a way for consumers to revisit motion-picture stories before the widespread availability of affordable home recording and video playback equipment such as VCRs. = Educational = The widespread familiarity of fotonovelas in Spanish-language culture makes photo comics an effective vehicle for health promotion and health education.Flora, C.

Career He was born in Leeds, where he lived for most of his life.Palmer (2004). He worked briefly with his brother in an antique business, then turned to landscape painting, for which he travelled widely, which gave him the opportunity to get to know local music.Francmanis (2004), 45-8. He was interested both in living folk music, which he gathered with the help of his niece Emma Mary Kidson (whom he called Ethel), and in the printed remains of popular music, which he collected and on which he was recognised as the leading authority of his day. His early work on folk music, published in Old English Country Dances (1890) and Traditional Tunes: A collection of ballad airs (1891) gave impetus to a rising interest in the subject. He was one of the founders of the Folk-Song Society in 1898 and guided its publications with his knowledge of early ballad literature. \\"English folk-song and dance\\" by Frank Kidson and Mary Neal was published in 1915. Other aspects of the developing folksong revival were less welcome to him, in particular Cecil Sharp‚Äôs enthusiasm for institutionalising folk music and dance in education.Francmanis (2001), 58-60. He published one further book of folk music A Garland of English Folk-Songs (1926); and after his death, on 7 November 1926, Ethel Kidson edited two further books from his collections, Folk Songs of the North Countrie (1927) and English Peasant Songs (1929).

Background A product of the very first crop of one of America's foremost stallions, Sir Archy, Lady Lightfoot was almost certainly his best daughter. Lady Lightfoot was bred by John Tayloe III and foaled at Belair Stud in Maryland. (Tayloe had a hand in many a great horse's life, especially in her sire's life. Though Sir Archy would eventually \\"stand\\" in North Carolina, in those days, sires often traveled from farm to farm selling their \\"services.\\") Racing career In the filly's very first race, a three heat effort of four miles per heat, she went up against a horse called Hermaphrodite. He won the first heat, and she won the next two. The time clocked for Hermaphrodite's win was 7 minutes 52 seconds. Lady Lightfoot's time for the last two heats was 7 minutes 53 seconds and 7 minutes 52 seconds. These are the fastest times for four miles in Maryland in her day. The racing records during Lady Lightfoot‚Äôs life are incomplete. Some say she started 23 times, 15 of these starts in 4 mile heats. Others say there is evidence she could have won 30 or 40 races. It‚Äôs for certain that in the year 1817 when she was five years old, under her trainer William Wynn (known as \\"Racing Billy\\"), she and her half-brother Timoleon, won five of the six races in the Charleston, Virginia winter meet. One of the few races Lady Lightfoot lost was to one of America‚Äôs greats, American Eclipse. On October 15, 1821 at the Union Course on Long Island, New York when Lady Lightfoot was nine, American Eclipse at age 7 beat her in straight heats. Lady Lightfoot raced right through her eleventh year. Breeding record When Lady Lightfoot produced she dropped eight foals in nine years. Several of her foals achieved fame, especially her great daughter, Black Maria by her old rival American Eclipse. (Not to be confused with Lady Lightfoot's dam, also called Black Maria.) Many consider Black Maria a greater runner than her dam. Lady Lightfoot seems to have died soon after her last foal, making the date 1832 or 1833. She would have been 19 or 20 years old.

After Shams al-Din Shah 'Ali's death Qutb al-Din was selected by the malik as his replacement. Both Shah-i Shahan and Qutb al-Din participated in Timur's campaign against the Ottomans in 1402; on the return journey Shah-i Shahan died and Timur appointed Qutb al-Din as his successor. After assuming the governorship of Sistan, Qutb al-Din handed out the governorship of several towns to other Mihrabanids, at the same time initiating a purge amongst the Mihrabanid ranks by executing several family members he considered troublesome. In 1405 he was summoned by Timur, who was preparing to invade China, to Otrar. At the head of an army of Sistan, Qutb al-Din marched north, but at Herat he received news of Timur's death from Shah Rukh and turned around. Shah Rukh, who established himself as the ruler of Khurasan in the aftermath of Timur's death, confirmed Qutb al-Din's position as governor of Sistan. Soon after Qutb al-Din's ascension the neighboring province of Farah was invaded by one of Shah Rukh's commanders, Hasan Jandar. Fearing that Hasan Jandar would target Sistan next, Qutb al-Din gave refuge to the malik of Farah, Iksandar ibn Inaltigin. He then dispatched an army to Farah, which drove out Hasan Jandar and put Iksandar back on his throne. In the fall of 1408 Sistan was invaded by Shah Rukh, who had been angered by Qutb al-Din's failure to acknowledge the Timurid's suzerainty in the khutba or on the coinage, and by the malik's grant of refuge to one of Shah Rukh's rivals, Abu Bakr ibn Miran Shah. Uq was captured and Abu Bakr fled Sistan, but Shah Rukh was reluctant to risk a battle with the Mihrabanid army outside Shahr-i Sistan. Instead, the Timurids went around Sistan destroying agricultural fields and dams, which caused famine in the province. Shah Rukh then departed for Herat, leaving behind some of his forces and appointing a rival Mihrabanid, Shah Sultan ibn Shah Khusraw ibn Shah Arslan as governor of Sistan. Qutb al-Din, however, was determined to maintain his rule over Sistan, and was able to kill Shah Sultan while the latter was still en route to take over the province. The Mihrabanid army then captured a Timurid garrison at the fortress of Lash and was victorious against a Timurid army that had been sent from Herat. The heads of the defeated Timurid soldiers were sent to Shahr-i Sistan and a pyramid of them was made at the gate of the city. Uq was retaken and the Timurids had been forced out of Sistan by mid-1409. At this point the Timurids and Mihrabanids decided to make peace with each other. Qutb al-Din agreed to place Shah Rukh's name first in the khutba and on the coinage, and to send one of his sons or brothers as a hostage to Herat; his son Jalal al- Din was eventually sent to honor this agreement. Both Jalal al-Din and his brother Shams al-Din 'Ali ended up in the service of Shah Rukh's army. Qutb al-Din himself participated in a 1416 Timurid campaign to quell a rebellion in Kerman. In the meantime, trouble in Sistan arose Qutb al-Din's half-brother Najm al-Din Shah Mahmud Hajji demanded a share of power and threatened to revolt. When his appeal to Shah Rukh for support in this endeavor was denied, however, he backed down and decided to go to Arabia to participate in the Hajj. When he returned in 1417 he made no further moves to undermine Qutb al- Din's authority. Qutb al-Din died in 1419 from an illness; the Mihrabanids and amirs then chose his successor, his son Shams al-Din 'Ali. References *Bosworth, C.E.

The Port of Sines is the first largest artificial port of Portugal, and a deep water port, natural backgrounds to -28 m ZH with specialized terminals that allow the movement of different types of goods . Besides being the main port on the Atlantic seaboard of Portugal due to its geophysical characteristics, is the main gateway to the energy supply of Portugal: container, natural gas, coal, oil and its derivatives (Features, 2007). Construction started in 1973 and came into operation in 1978. On December 14, 1977 the Administration was created the Port of Sines (APS) (30, 2007). The port operates 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, providing services such as: control of maritime traffic; pilotage, towage and mooring; access control and surveillance; drinking water and bunkers; prevent accidents/pollution; repairs on board or ashore ( Services, 2007). The Port of Sines is located at 37¬∞ 57‚Ä≤ north latitude and 08¬∞ 52‚Ä≤ west longitude, to 58 nautical miles south of Lisbon ( Map, 2007). General view of the port.  Location and hinterland  The Port of Sines is located on the Southwest of Europe, south from Lisbon, on the cross of the main international maritime routes ‚Äì East-West and North-South. (Latitude: 37¬∞ 57‚Ä≤ N Longitude: 08¬∞ 53‚Ä≤ W) The Port of Sines direct hinterland comprises all the south and midland part of Portugal. It is located at 150 km from Lisbon, 125 km from √âvora, 100 km from Beja and 182 km from Faro. Users of the port can interact with all the authorities and port services through a single communication channel.  Terminals = Liquid Bulk Terminal = The Liquid Bulk Terminal (TGLS), inaugurated in 1978, is the largest liquid bulk terminal in the country. With six jetties and natural beds down to 28 metres ZH, it has the capacity to receive vessels up to 350,000 tones Dwt, and allows the simultaneous handling of different products (crude, refined products, liquefied gases and other liquid bulks). This terminal is operated by CLT ‚Äì Companhia Log√≠stica de Terminais Mar√≠timos. = Petrochemical Terminal = 375px Since 1981 the Port of Sines has a terminal dedicated to petrochemical products, which allows the handling of goods via a dedicated pipeline between vessels and the petrochemical complex located in the ZILS ‚Äì Sines Industrial and Logistics Area of Sines. This terminal is run by Repsol Pol√≠meros. = Multipurpose Terminal = The Sines Multipurpose Terminal came on line in 1992 under a public service concession granted to the company Portsines. It is geared towards handling solid bulk, general cargo and ro-ro. It has 4 berths with a total length of 645 metres at the extrados and 296 meters at the intrados. With depths going down to 18 metres ZH, this allows the reception of ships up to 190,000 tonnes Dwt. = LNG Terminal = The Liquefied Natural Gas Terminal started in 2003 and is run under a private use concession by the company REN Atl√¢ntico, today handling over 60% of the natural gas consumed in Portugal. Equipped with one jetty with beds of 15 metres ZH, it allows the reception of LNG tankers up to 216,000 cubic metres. = Container Terminal ‚Äì Terminal XXI = The Sines Container Terminal, called Terminal XXI, started its operations in 2004 under a public service concession by the company PSA Sines (PSA, a global port operator, formerly the Port of Singapore Authority). Terminal XXI provides beds of 16 metres ZH, allowing the mooring of large container ships from intercontinental routes and of the ships with the respective connections by feeder. The open sea port is sheltered by two breakwaters ‚Äì West Breakwater (2.000 m N-S orientation) and the East Breakwater (2.200 m NW-SE orientation). The Port of Sines and the Industrial and Logistics Zone offer road and rail connections directly linked to the terminals. Links to both the Portuguese and Spanish hinterland (IC33 ‚Äì Sines/√âvora/Spain; IP8 ‚Äì Sines/Beja/Spain; and rail connection Sines/Elvas/Spain) are planned. The land allocated to the development of the ZAL at Sines covers two areas: one situated in the intra-port zone and the other one in the extra-port zone The fishing harbour is formed by an inner basin sheltered by a breakwater.

Another term for an offensive often used by the media is 'invasion', or the more general 'attack'. The offensive was considered a pre-eminent means of producing victory, although with the recognition of a defensive phase at some stage of the execution.p.220, Glantz A quick guide to the size or scope of the offensive is to consider the number of troops involved in the side initiating the offensive. Offensives are largely conducted as a means to secure initiative in a confrontation between opponents. They can be waged on land, at seaEdward Wegener; Henning Wegener, The Soviet Naval Offensive: An Examination of the Strategic Role of Soviet Naval Forces in the East-West Conflict, Naval Institute Press, 1976 or in the air. A naval offensive, such as the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, can have wide-ranging implications for national strategies and require a significant logistical commitment to destroy enemy naval capabilities. It can also be used to interdict enemy shipping, such as World War II's Battle of the Atlantic. Naval offensives can also be tactical, such as Operation Coronado IXp.135, Fulton conducted by the United States Navy's Mobile Riverine Force during the Vietnam War. An air offensive is an operation that can describe any number of different types of operations, usually restricted to specific types of aircraft. The offensives conducted with the use of fighter aircraft are predominantly concerned with establishing air superiority in a given air space, or over a given territory. A bomber offensive is sometimes also known as a strategic bombing offensive and was prominently used by the Allies on a large scale during World War II.Longmate, pp.309-312 Use of ground attack aircraft in support of ground offensives can be said to be an air offensive, such as that performed in the opening phase of the Red Army's Operation Kutuzov and Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev, when hundreds of Il-2 aircraft were used en masse to overwhelm the Wehrmacht's ground troops. Theatre offensive A theatre offensive can be a war and a dominant feature of a national security policy, or one of several components of war if a country is involved in several theatres such as the United Kingdom in 1941. In general theatre, offensives require over 250,000 troops to be committed to combat operations, including combined planning for different arms and services of the armed forces, such as air defence troops integrated into the overall plan for ground operations.Isby, p.52 Strategic offensive A strategic offensive is often a campaign and would involve the use of over 100,000 troops as part of a general strategy of the conflict in a given theatre. For example, the Operation Barbarossa was a theatre offensive composed of three distinct and inter-related campaigns in the Southern, Central and Northern parts of USSR territory. Soviet strategic offensive operations during World War II often involved multi-front coordinated operations. Along with the Wehrmacht operations on the Eastern Front of World War II, these were the largest military operations of the twentieth century. Strategic operations of the Red Army in World War II provides a listing of large-scale Soviet operations. A strategic offensive is the aggressive expression of war planning and the use of strategic forces as a whole, combining all resources available for achieving defined and definitive goals that would fundamentally alter the balance of power between belligerents.p.8, Glantz (1991) However, the planning and execution of strategic offensives are always based on theoretical considerations because it is impractical, uneconomic and difficult to hide a full-scale rehearsal of large-scale operations. A strategic offensive consists of simultaneous, tandem or phased operational offensives that seek to achieve specific operational objectives that eventually lead to the achievement of a strategic goal, usually a complete defeat of the opposition, but also destruction of a significant enemy force or occupation of strategically significant territory, such as the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation.page xvii, Glantz (2003) Any given strategic offensive is a derivative of a combination of factors such as national military doctrine, past military experience, and analysis of socio- political, economic and military circumstances.p.8, Glantz (1991) An offensive An offensive is a conduct of combat operations that seek to achieve only some of the objectives of the strategy being pursued in the theatre as a whole. Commonly an offensive is carried out by one or more divisions, numbering between 10‚Äì30,000 troops as part of a combined arms manoeuvre.

Howard Inc. 1987) ISMB0-930919378 Initially commissioned as captain on June 22, 1861, he fought at the First Battle of Manassas. On August 21, 1861, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the 33rd. He fought in General Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson's Shenandoah Valley Campaign in the spring of 1862, under Col. John F. Neff (a Lutheran minister's son and fellow VMI graduate killed in action at the Second Battle of Manassas). Jones was then appointed to command a brigade in the Stonewall Division. He commanded the brigade throughout the Seven Days fighting at the Battle of White Oak Swamp and Malvern Hill, where he was wounded, mustered out and recommissioned. Jones healed and rejoined the army during the Maryland Campaign and took command of the Stonewall Division, which then captured the Union outpost at Harpers Ferry. At the Battle of Antietam, his brigade was one of two on the front line and attacked early on September 17. They held the line for about an hour before partially retreating. However, a nearby shell burst stunned Jones and caused hearing loss, so he relinquished his command to Brig. Gen. William E. Starke, who fell mortally wounded, leaving Col. A.J. Grigsby in command. Following the Maryland Campaign, Jones returned to the Shenandoah Valley, and was tasked with rounding up deserters. Jones rejoined the Army of Northern Virginia the day before the Battle of Fredericksburg when he returned to command his old brigade. After Fredericksburg, charges of cowardice were levelled against him by several subordinates, who claimed he had used a tree for protection. He was acquitted in April 1863 after a month- long trial, but again charged with cowardice for leaving the Chancellorsville battlefield because of an ulcerated leg. He was never given a field command again and was seized by Federal troops on July 4, 1863, near Smithsburg, Maryland. He was imprisoned for the rest of the war with no desire by Richmond authorities to affect an exchange.

The Tour Royale (also known as La Grosse Tour) is a fort built in the 16th century to protect the entrance of the Petit Rade, the naval port of Toulon. It was the first fortification of the harbor, built 22 years after Provence became a part of France. The fort was commissioned in 1513 by King Louis XII at the request of the bishop of Toulon and of the Senechal of Provence.La Tour Royale et son parc paysager visitor guide published by the city of Toulon, 2nd edition, July 2010 It was placed on the cap de la Manegue, at the end of the pointe de la Mitre, where it could fire at any ships coming into the Rade. The design was by the Italian engineer Gian-Antonio della Porta.Verg√©-Franceschi, Toulon - port royal 1481-1789, Tallandier, 2002. It was a classical example of a Torrioni, a round tower with cannon, constructed around Renaissance Italy in the 16th century. The tower was sixty meters in diameter and seven meters thick. Construction began in 1514 and was finished in 1524, during the reign of Francis I of France, at a cost of 30,000 florins. Because of its impressive size, the residents of Toulon called \\"La Grosse Tour.\\" The tower had hardly been finished when it was captured by the army of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, led by the Connetable de Bourbon, when he invaded Provence. The Connetable avoided a long and costly siege by simply paying the commander of the fort 500 ecues to surrender. After the commander and garrison took their money and left, the fort was occupied by 300 Spanish mercenaries. This event led to the coining of an expression in Toulon, \\"to be sold like the Grosse Tour.\\" When the Imperial army left, the fort was used to imprison the chevalier Bertrande de la Garde, who had fought for Charles V against Francis I. He was the first of many political prisoners to be held in the underground cells of the fort.

In 1798 the future Empress Josephine watched Napoleon's fleet sail to Egypt from the parapet of the Tour Royale Circular stairways lead down from the gun platform to the lower galleries and powder magazines of the Tour Royale In 1543, Francis I formed a temporary Franco-Ottoman alliance with the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, and invited the Ottoman fleet to spend the winter in Toulon harbour. The Tour Royale was used to store all the artillery from the ramparts of Toulon, until the Ottoman fleet departed. In 1572, when the news of the massacre of Protestants in Paris on St. Bartholomew's Day became known, the commander of the fort, Nicolas de Pignan, gave sanctuary to the Protestant families of Toulon within the fort. In 1596, during the wars of religion across France, the commander of the Chateau D'If, who had remained loyal to Henry IV of France, had a meeting in the Tour Royale with the Duke de Guise, Governor of Provence, to agree on a way to drive the Spaniards from Marseille, which had declared itself an independent republic.' 'La Tour Royale et son parc paysager visitor guide published by the city of Toulon, 2nd edition, July 2010 In 1634, Cardinal Richelieu decided to strengthen the harbor defenses and had a second fort, Fort Ballaguier, constructed opposite the Tour Royale. In 1679, Louis XIV sent his chief military architect, Vauban, to make the fortifications of Toulon strong enough to resist a British attack. Vauban described the Tour Royale as a \\"very beautiful work with several floors and batteries,\\" but he considered it unfinished.Vauban, \\"Memoire sur les fortifications de Toulon, 1679 He recommended adding another level of cannons, and a new battery at the foot of the tower, and lowering the hills around to give the gunners a clearer view of approaching enemy ships.Vauban a Toulon - l'arsenal et la rade (see bibliography) The Tour was equipped with forty cannon, but Vauban's other improvements were not carried out. Nonetheless, in 1707, during the War of the Spanish Succession, the Tour helped Toulon to successfully resist a combined attack and siege by a British-Dutch fleet and the army of Eugene of Savoy. In 1770, a new fort, Fort Lamalgue, was constructed at the harbor entrance, the Tour Royale was no longer as important for the defense of the port. It became primarily a place to lock up military prisoners, Corsican rebels, and, during the French Revolution, first royalists and then supporters of the Republic. In 1798, when Napoleon Bonaparte's fleet of 200 ships departed Toulon for Egypt, the future Empress Josephine watched the departure of the fleet from the Tour Royale. The Tour Royale is located at the southernmost point on the east side of the harbor entrance, near the base of the long jetty that now closes the harbor. During the Franco-German War of 1870, the gold reserves of France were secretly stored inside the fort. During the First World War, it was used both as barracks and to intern German prisoners of war. During the Second World War, the fort was occupied by a German garrison. It was badly damaged by Allied bombings in 1943-1944. The Tour Royale was classified as an historic monument on April 11, 1947. The underground cells were filled in, and the chapel, barracks and hospital were removed, but the casemates, circular galleries and embrasures for the cannon still remain as they were. In 2004, the tower became a museum, and in 2006, it was transferred from the Ministry of Defense to the city of Toulon. and opened to the public. A coastal path from the fort connects it to the beaches of Mourillon. As of September 2010 the Tour Royale is open to the public from July 1 until October 31, on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays, from 900 until 1200 and from 1400 until 1800.

Although his ministerial career was not particularly noteworthy, he was a prolific artist in many media including watercolor, printmaking, oil, pen and ink, and pencil. His framed art not only hangs in hundreds of private and public collections, but can also be found in many realms of graphic design, including book and magazine illustration, greeting cards, sign painting and calligraphy, murals, typographic design, and decorative papers. While his style evolved with the times in which he lived, and was particularly influenced by modernism in the 1930s, he is best known for the fine precision of his prints and the realism of his watercolors. Early life Charles Pont was born in Saint-Julien-en-Genevois, France, on 6 January 1898 to a Swiss mother and an unknown father. His mother abandoned him in New York City when he was three months old, and he was raised there by a German immigrant couple who had no other children. Informed of his adoption at age seventeen, Charles reverted to the name on his birth certificate, which included his natural mother's unmarried family name of Pont. Entering the work force at age fifteen in 1913, Pont quickly transitioned through twenty clerical and manual labor jobs by 1925. He registered for the draft in 1917, but a serious illness incapacitated him until the end of the First World War. Family Charles Pont was married in New York on 2 January 1925 to Dorothea Ford, one of five daughters of Irish immigrants. His only child, Joan Dorothea, was born 14 October 1927. At age fifty-two in 1950, Pont was reunited for the first time with his natural mother, Fran√ßoise Fournier-Pont (1872‚Äì1963). Charles Pont lived most of his life in New York City, moving in 1958 to the house he had built in Wilton, Connecticut. He died at home on 28 July 1971 aged seventy-three. His wife died in the same house in 1988, as did his daughter in 2006. Pont is survived by one grandchild and two great- grandchildren. Art career Pont's artistic talent was already evident during secondary school, and he pursued a professional formation at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and The Cooper Union in Manhattan. In 1933 he received a scholarship to continue his training with the American Artists League. His professional career began in 1925 as a carpenter and cabinet-maker in New York. Although he gave up this business in 1932, he never forgot these skills, and twenty years later designed and built his own home in Wilton, Connecticut. In the midst of the Great Depression, Charles Pont turned to the fine arts as a full-time career, working chiefly as a book and magazine illustrator. Pursuing a nautical interest inherited from his adoptive father who had served in the German Imperial Navy, Pont became renowned as a maritime artist, painting covers for magazines such as Motor Boating, Yachting and Power Boating, as well as illustrating numerous marine books by authors such as Alan Villiers. He also illustrated numerous children's books by Joseph Leeming, Irving Simon, John Hooper and others, and Christian literature by such authors as Harry A. Ironside. In 1938-41, he was paid by the federal Works Progress Administration to produce public art, and completed twenty-eight murals among other projects. During the 1930s he also turned to printmaking, receiving honors in wood engraving, lithography and etching. While pursuing a second career as an itinerant preacher in the 1940s, Pont painted not only Biblical themes, but also landscapes in thirty states, as well as Canada and several European countries. Working with equal skill in oil, watercolor, ink, and printmaking, most of Pont's work remained nautical. In retired life he devoted himself to capturing the charm of the New England coast before all the 19th century sail lofts, docks and buildings were demolished. Giving up the ministry as a full-time occupation in the late 1940s, Pont turned again to commercial art for a living, and served as assistant art director for the New York publisher Grosset & Dunlap from 1954 until his retirement in 1963. Later, Pont taught art for Darien High School evening classes, and the Famous Artists School in Westport, both in Connecticut. Pont's art was exhibited in his lifetime in practically every state as well as the 1939 New York World's Fair. His work in permanent public collections includes the Library of Congress, Smithsonian Institution, and Navy Department in Washington DC, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and New York Public Library in New York City, the Syracuse Museum, the Rochester Institute of Technology, and the Wilton, Connecticut, Town Hall, among many others. Pont's professional associations included the American Artists Professional League, Southern Printmakers Society, American Water Color Society, New York Water Color Society, American Institute of Graphic Arts, and The Typophiles. Christian ministry Given six months to live in 1918, Pont became a born-again Christian and eventually considered the ministry his life-calling. He frequently combined his artistic training with his ministry, giving many illustrated talks. The American Artists Group referred to him as \\"America's only artist-cleric\\". While still studying for ordination, Pont was appointed in 1939 to his first pastorate at Gilbert Memorial Church (now Georgetown Bible Church) in Georgetown, Connecticut. During this period he was also director (1940‚Äì1942) of the Old Fashioned New England Bible Hour, a radio program broadcast from Norwalk, Connecticut. Receiving his pastoral training at Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary (now Palmer Theological Seminary) in Pennsylvania, and Shelton College in New York City, he was ordained by the South Brooklyn Baptist Church in 1943, and moved later that year to become pastor of First Baptist Church of New Durham in North Bergen, New Jersey. Resigning that position in late 1944, he became for several years an itinerant preacher in the Eastern and Midwestern States. Unable to adequately support his family in that ministry, he returned to secular work about 1950, but remained available for the rest of his life as a guest and substitute speaker in numerous churches in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey. In the course of his ministry, Pont published two books, The Tabernacle Alphabet (Loizeaux Brothers, 1946), which he also illustrated, and The World's Collision (W.A. Wilde Co., 1956).

Career and awards  Pond spent much of the 80s and 90s writing for television, magazines, and creating cartoons and comic strips for both mediums. She briefly worked on The Simpsons, writing the first full-length broadcast episode, \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\" in 1989, which was nominated for two Emmy awards. Pond, however, did not become a regular member of the writing team, and she alleged it was because the showrunner at the time did not want a woman on the team. She is primarily a cartoonist and illustrator and she got her first big break as a weekly cartoonist with Spectator Magazine. Some of her other early work during the 1980s included creating for publications such as, the National Lampoon, The Village Voice, The New York Times, Adweek, and others. She is the author and illustrator of five humor books and currently contributes to the Los Angeles Times. She won the PEN Center USA award for Graphic Literature Outstanding Body of Work, with a special mention for her 2014 graphic novel, Over Easy, for Canadian publisher Drawn & Quarterly.The 24th Annual Literary Awards Pond also won an Inkpot Award in 2014 at the San Diego Comic-Con, after the release of Over Easy. Pond has also written for Designing Women on CBS and Pee-Wee's Playhouse, as well as being a cartoonist for the Los Angeles Times and other publications.89.3 KPCC  Perspectives  Mimi Pond She also wrote a long- running full page comic for Seventeen Magazine from the 1980s ‚Äì 1990s. Following her book Shoes Never Lie, the Boston Globe described her as \\"perhaps the leading authority on the spiritual, emotional and visceral connection between women and shoes\\" (for a story on the shoe collection of Imelda Marcos). = Graphic memoirs = She has also written two graphic memoirs, Over Easy and The Customer is Always Wrong. The two memoirs are loosely based on Pond's own life and sequentially work together as one large story arc. The subject matter is primarily focused on her time as a waitress in Oakland, trying to become a full-time artist after her studies.  Over Easy  Pond spent over 15 years working on the graphic narrative, however, the idea had been sitting with her since her time as a waitress in an Oakland, California restaurant during the 1970s. Over Easy is a coming of age story about a young Margaret Pond as she works at Imperial Caf√©, a diner full of hippies and punks in the late 70s. It is in this diner that Margaret makes the transition into 'Madge' and gets a glimpse at adulthood, which includes addiction, confusion, awkward moments, the artist dream, and sexual awakenings. Over Easy encapsulates 1970s Oakland in a witty, slightly fictionalized, memoir of Pond's experiences. The memoir also gained a significant amount of praise from journals and news publications such as, USA Today,The Comics Journal, NPR, Publishers Weekly, The National Post and more.  The Customer is Always Wrong  In 2017, Pond released her second graphic memoir and continuation of the narrative in Over Easy. Madge is still working at the vibrant Imperial Caf√© in Oakland, is surrounded by similar misfits in the restaurant, and still has the dream to become an artist. In The Customer is Always Wrong, Madge finally makes the decision to save up enough money to get out of the West coast and head East to New York where she could pursue her art full-time. The second novel also has a darker tone to it compared to the first part of the story, making the subject matter difficult for Pond to relive as she created the story. The Customer is Always Wrong was well received by fans, similar to the first memoir. It gained praise from publications such as PEN America, Entertainment Weekly, Vulture and more.  Personal life  Pond is married to cartoonist and artist Wayne White. They have two children together, Woodrow and Lulu White, who are both artists. In the 1970s, Pond worked at Mama's Royal Caf√©, which became the inspiration for her graphic memoirs. = Education = In the 1970s, Pond attended the California College of the Arts (CCA) for an art degree.

The need for studies in the more natural setting of the child's home, and at a much higher sampling rate approaching the child's total experience, led to the development of this project concept. A digital network consisting of eleven video cameras, fourteen microphones, and an array of data capture hardware was installed in the home of the subject. A cluster of ten computers and audio samplers is located in the basement of the house to capture the data. Data from the cluster is moved manually to the MIT campus as necessary for storage in a one- million-gigabyte (one-petabyte) storage facility. To provide control of the observation system to the occupants of the house, eight touch-activated displays were wall-mounted throughout the house to allow for stopping and starting video and or audio recording, and also erase any number of minutes permanently from the system.

He was the last leader of the liberal Progressive Federal Party and then the co-leader of the new liberal Democratic Party. Educated at Bishop's Diocesan College in Rondebosch, He completed an MBChB degree at the University of Cape Town in 1951. There he was elected president of the Students Representative Council.  Political career  De Beer was first elected to the House of Assembly in 1953 as an MP for the opposition United Party. He was 24 years old at the time, and was the youngest MP ever elected to the parliament. On the party's left wing, he and fellow MPs including Helen Suzman, Colin Eglin, Ray Swart, Harry Lawrence and Dr Jan Steytler resigned from the party after its national congress voted against returning any further land to the black majority for their occupation and use. He and the other liberal MPs formed the new Progressive Party in 1959. Like all the Progressive MPs except Helen Suzman, De Beer lost his seat in the 1961 general election. He joined an advertising agency before moving on to work for the Anglo American PLC/De Beers diamond mining conglomerate. In the 1977 general election, he was returned to Parliament as an MP for what had become the Progressive Federal Party which had been formed that year through a merger of the Progressive Party and various other liberal groups of MPs. He became the PFP's leader in August 1988 and, with Denis Worrall and Wynand Malan was a co- leader of the new Democratic Party when it formed in 1989. Following the DP's defeat in the first post-apartheid election of 1994, De Beer resigned as party leader. He was appointed South African ambassador to the Netherlands by Nelson Mandela. De Beer was for many years a director of Anglo American PLC/De Beers. He died of a stroke at his home in Clifton, Cape Town, in 1999.

Description  Members of the genus Amphioctopus reside in tropical and subtropical waters. These octopuses are found primarily in the Pacific and Indian Oceans but representatives can also be found in the Atlantic. They are characterized by arms that are about two or three times their mantle length with deep lateral webs and very shallow dorsal webs.Norman, M.D. & F.G. Hochberg (2005). The current state of octopus taxonomy. Phuket Marine Biological Center Research Bulletin 66: 127‚Äì154. This genus can be further divided into two subgroups, one group with ocellate octopuses, the other with non-ocellate octopuses.Norman, M. (2003). Cephalopods: A World Guide. Hackenheim, ConchBooks, p. 214.  Taxonomic status  Historically, members of this genus were placed within the genus Octopus, but recognized as forming a distinct group and referred to as the Octopus aegina species complex.Huffard, C.L. & F.G. Hochberg (2005). Molluscan Research 25(3): 113‚Äì128. The genus was originally described by Fischer in 1882. He assigned to it the already described species, Octopus membranaceus (Quoy and Gaimard, 1832), as the type species (not to be confused with Enteroctopus membranaceus (Rochebrune and Mabille, 1889), the original types species of the genus Enteroctopus). Robson in his review of octopus taxonomy in 1929 regarded Amphioctopus membranaceus as a nomen dubium, referring it to his newly named \\"aegina species complex\\", a group of octopuses forming a distinct constellation characterized by Octopus aegina. The genus Amphioctopus was subsequently considered invalid. In 2002, Gleadall suggested that the aegina species group represents a distinct genus with Amphioctopus being the senior name. In 2004, Gleadall resurrected the genus Schizoctopus and assigned Octopus fangsiao as the type species.Gleadall, I.G. (2004). Some Old and New Genera of Octopus. Interdisciplinary Information Sciences. 10(2): 99‚Äì112. In 2005, Huffard and Hochberg, arguing that Robson's designation of Octopus membranaceus as a nomen dubium was premature and considering it a valid name, resurrected the genus name Amphioctopus for the Octopus aegina species complex. Huffard and Hochberg also found Schizoctopus to be a junior synonym for Amphioctopus.

It is a shrub with linear, pointed leaves and faintly scented, pale yellow flowers in open heads on the ends of the branches. It is fairly common in a small area south of Badgingarra. Description Verticordia patens is a slender, woody shrub which grows to a height of between and up to wide. The leaves are linear in shape, semi-circular in cross-section and long with a pointed end. The flowers are faintly scented and arranged in fairly open, corymb-like groups on the ends of the branches on erect stalks long. The floral cup is about long, glabrous and slightly warty. The sepals are spreading, lemon-yellow, long, with between 5 and 7 feathery lobes and two hairy appendages. The petals are erect, pale yellow, about long and egg.shaped with a toothed margin. The style is long, straight and glabrous. Flowering time is from September to November. Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described by Alex George in 1966 and the description was published in Western Australian Naturalist. He collected the type specimen at Moore River. The specific epithet (patens) is a Latin word meaning \\"open\\" referring to the open branching habit of this species. When he reviewed the genus in 1991, George placed this species in subgenus Chrysoma, section Chrysohoe along with V. nitens and V. nitens. Distribution and habitat This verticordia occurs in a small area between Badgingarra, Coorow and Moore River. It usually grows in sand or gravelly soil, sometimes over laterite or loam, in heath, shrubland or low woodland. Conservation Verticordia patens is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Although its range is limited, it is fairly common in that area, part of which includes a significant national park. Use in horticulture It possible to propagate V. patens from cuttings but the plant has proven difficult to maintain in the garden due to its susceptibility to fungal disease.

This house, centered at the western district of Argveti, has survived to the end of the Georgian kingdoms and the Russian Empire which granted them recognition of their princely title (Georgian: tavadi, Russian: knyaz) in 1850.Toumanoff, Cyril (1967). Studies in Christian Caucasian History, p. 272. Georgetown University Press. –ú—Ö–µ–∏–¥–∑–µ. Russian Biographic Dictionary. Retrieved on January 6, 2008.  History  According to the Georgian author Ioane Bagrationi, writing early in the 19th century, the Mkheidze traced their descent to the medieval house of Liparitid-Orbeli though the version cannot be substantiated by servicing historical evidence. A legend has it that the 8th-century nobles David and Constantine killed by the Arabs belonged to the Mkheidze family. The Mkhe(ts)idze are first documented in the 11th-century cross inscription. In the early 16th century, the Mkheidze fief ‚Äì Samkheidzo ‚Äì emerged centered on the village of Zedubani near the present-day town of Tqibuli, but went in decline later that century. In the 17th century, the family partially restored its old prestige. Several of its members occupied high posts at the court of the Imeretian kings. They intermarried with the Dadiani of Mingrelia, the Gurieli of Guria, and the Bagrationi of Kakheti and of Imereti. With the death of Giorgi Mkheidze (1795‚Äì1856), the princely branch of the Imeretian Chkheidze became extinct in their male line. The surviving Chkheidze descend from the gentry (aznauri) line as well as the princely one established in Mingrelia in the first half of the 18th century.

Her main armament consisted of eight QF guns with a secondary armament of eight 3-pounders. As well as four machine guns, the ship also mounted two submerged torpedo tubes. Philomel was launched on 28 August 1890, and completed the following March. After completing sea trials, she was commissioned in the Royal Navy on 10 November 1891. Commanded by Captain Charles Campbell, she was assigned to the Cape of Good Hope Station although fitting work and working up trials meant that Philomel did not arrive in South Africa until June 1892. Operational history For six years, Philomel served on station, intercepting slave traders along the coast of Africa. In 1896, she participated in the Anglo-Zanzibar War, during which rebels murdered the Sultan of Zanzibar and seized his palace. Along with the three gunboats and , she bombarded the palace fortress and the only ship of the Zanzibar Navy, . This action lasted less than an hour and resulted in the routing of the rebels. The following year, Philomel was transferred to the West Africa Station and participated in the Benin Expedition. A refit was completed in 1898 after which Philomel returned to Cape of Good Hope Station. She served throughout the Second Boer War. Some of her complement of 220 men served in the field with the Naval Brigade. Two of her 4.7-inch guns were disembarked and used in the Battle of Colenso. After the war, she returned to Devonport and was paid off on 22 March 1902. She was laid up in the Firth of Forth for several years before a refit was carried out in 1907 at Haulbowline Dock in Ireland. During her tow to Ireland she went adrift for a night in the North Sea when the rope to the towing vessel, , broke. Philomel was recommissioned in February 1908 for service with the Mediterranean Fleet under the command of Captain John Seagrave. She provided assistance in the wake of the earthquake at Messina in Sicily. The following year she served with the East Indies Station, running patrols from Aden in the Persian Gulf for two years and served in operations off Somaliland, 1908‚Äì1910. =Transfer to New Zealand= In 1913 the Admiralty agreed to lend Philomel to New Zealand as a seagoing training cruiser to form the nucleus of the newly established New Zealand Naval Forces, which was a new division of the Royal Navy. This was in response to the desire of the New Zealand Minister of Defence at the time, James Allen, who wanted to establish a local naval force which would co-operate with the fledgling Royal Australian Navy. Philomel was recommissioned in October 1913 in Singapore and later sailed for New Zealand to join and HMAS Pyramus, both s serving in New Zealand waters. Philomel was commissioned for New Zealand service on 15 July 1914, under the command of Captain Percival Hall-Thompson. Although mainly crewed by Englishmen, she was the country's first warship. =First World War= Captain P. Hall-Thompson, who commanded HMS Philomel for most of the First World War Philomel was on a short shakedown voyage to Picton on 30 July 1914, prior to taking on its first complement of New Zealand cadets, when it was recalled to Wellington Harbour in anticipation of the outbreak of war. Largely crewed by personnel from the Royal Navy, volunteers were brought on board to bring the ship up to full strength and after stocking up with supplies, she departed for Auckland to await further instructions. On 15 August 1914 she formed part of the ocean escort for the New Zealand forces which was dispatched to occupy German Samoa (now Samoa). The escort would have been unlikely to offer much resistance to the German cruisers and that were known to be in the area. Fortunately, the convoy did not encounter the German ships. Philomel then steamed for the Kingdom of Tonga to deliver news of the hostilities with Imperial Germany before returning to New Zealand. By now the main body of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, formed for service overseas, were ready to embark from Wellington on a convoy for the Middle East. Philomel escorted the convoy as far as Western Australia. Then, along with Pyramus, she sailed northeastwards for Singapore in search of the German cruiser , which was then carrying out raids in the Indian Ocean. The two ships, which would have been outgunned by the more modern Emden, had reached Christmas Island when they received news of Emdens sinking by . They arrived in Singapore on 12 November from where Philomel continued onto Port Said, escorting three French troopships. From late 1914, Philomel, needing maintenance and an update of equipment, was berthed at Malta and underwent an overhaul. This was completed by late January 1915 and she then started operations in the Mediterranean against the Turks. On 8 February she landed an armed party in Southern Turkey where a large force of Turkish soldiers were encountered, resulting in three seamen being killed and three wounded. This action marked the first deaths in the war of New Zealanders serving with a New Zealand formation. Subsequently, Philomel was deployed in the Red Sea and in the Persian Gulf for much of the remainder of the year. In December 1915 she sailed to Bombay for maintenance work but was back in the Persian Gulf in January 1916, continuing her patrolling. By the end of the year, her engines were giving trouble and her stern glands were worn out. A lengthy and costly refit was required and rather than incur this cost for a ship which was nearly at the end of her operational life, the Admiralty decided to gift her to New Zealand and dispatched her home to be paid off. She duly arrived in Wellington Harbour in March 1917. A large portion of her Royal Navy crew were returned to England to be assigned to other berths. Armament removed, Philomel was recommissioned as a depot ship in Wellington, supporting minesweeping operations until May 1919. =Postwar service= Slaves rescued by HMS 'Philomel', April 1893, Many of the children received by the Universities Mission. In March 1921, on the creation of the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy, Philomel was recommissioned as a training base. She steamed from her berth at Wellington to the dockyard at the Devonport Naval Base in Auckland. Moored alongside the training jetty, she was operated as a training facility for new recruits to the naval service, under the command of a series of officers from the Royal Navy including, for nearly six months in 1923, Commander Augustus Agar VC. Training armament was installed and in 1925, her boilers and engines were removed to create more accommodation space. Further accommodation, in the form of wooden cabins, was later constructed on her deck. In October 1941, on the creation of the Royal New Zealand Navy, Philomel was recommissioned as the training base . =Fate= Philomel was paid off and decommissioned on 17 January 1947 and her name transferred to the Devonport Naval Shore Establishment. On the day of her decommissioning, the New Zealand Naval Board sent a signal to Philomel which stated: The hulk of Philomel was sold to the Strongman Shipping Company, based in Coromandel. She was towed and deliberately ran aground in Coromandel harbour, near the wharf. After her fittings and parts were removed, she was towed out to sea and sunk near Cuvier Island on 6 August 1949. Much of the teak timber and some fittings went into a newly built coaster named Coromel, an amalgamation of Coromandel and Philomel. Her crest is mounted to the gate of the Devonport Naval Base.

He was born in Burgersdorp, in the then Cape Province now Eastern Cape Province. Background Steytler was an Afrikaner. His father Louw Steytler was a veteran of the Second Boer War, who had helped found the National Party (NP). Louw Steytler became a Member of Parliament, as a supporter of J. B. M. Hertzog, who led the NP and then the United Party (UP) after the fusion of 1934. When the UP split in 1939, the Steytler family broke with Hertzog to remain in the UP as supporters of Jan Smuts. Louw Steytler died in 1945. Jan Steytler went to England, in the 1930s, to study medicine at Guy's Hospital, London. As a student and later a member of staff, Steytler played first class Rugby Union for his hospital and was mentioned as a possible England player. On the outbreak of the Second World War, Steytler returned to South Africa to become a member of the Medical Corps of the Union Defence Force. After the war he became a District Surgeon in the Cape town of Beaufort West, where he became active in politics. Political career Steytler contested Beaufort West in the 1948 South African general election, as a UP candidate. Although he had no chance of election, in a strongly NP area, he was seen as a vigorous and attractive candidate. The following year he contested a by-election in another hopeless seat (De Aar-Colesberg), before being offered the UP candidacy in the safe UP seat of Queenstown. Steytler was elected a member of Parliament in the 1953 South African general election. His comparatively liberal views were not welcomed by some UP leaders. However when boundary changes made Queenstown marginal, Steytler won the seat by a majority of 13 in the 1958 South African general election. As a result of his increased prominence Steytler became the leader of the UP in Cape Province and tried to persuade his party to take a more liberal direction on racial issues.The Times, edition of 12 November 1959 (a profile article setting out details of Steytler's background and political career) After failing to prevail within the UP leadership, Steytler became the leading figure in a group of progressives which eventually broke away to found a new party. Steytler resigned from the UP on 17 August 1959 and was named as the first leader of the Progressive Party, when it was founded on 13 November 1959.The Times, edition of 18 August 1959 (reignation) and edition of 14 November 1959 (founding and leadership of new party). Steytler was a powerful personality and a compelling orator, but like all Progressive MPs with the sole exception of Helen Suzman, he lost his seat in the South African parliament in the 1961 general election. Steytler remained party leader until he retired from the post in December 1970.

As such, many Mahayana Buddhists consider it the prologue to the Lotus Sutra, and Chapter one of the Lotus Sutra states that the Buddha taught the Infinite Meanings just before expounding the Lotus Sutra.Shinjo Suguro, Nichiren Buddhist International Center, trans.

Text as Father: Paternal Seductions in Early Mahayana Buddhist Literature. University of California Press, p.59 Title For Buddhists, the term \\"Innumerable Meanings\\" or \\"Infinite Meanings\\" is used in two senses. The first, used in the singular, refers to the true aspect of all things, the true nature of all forms in the universe. The second sense, used in the plural, refers to the countless appearances or phenomena of the physical, visible world. All of these countless appearances are brought forth by the one true, pure world ‚Äì the true aspect of all things (the one true Dharma of \\"nonform\\"). Outline of the Sutra=Virtues= The Innumerable Meanings Sutra, gold, colour on blue paper, 13-14th century, Japan This is the first chapter of the Innumerable Meanings S≈´tra. It begins with the Buddha who is staying at the City of Royal Palaces on Mount G·πõdhrak≈´·π≠a, or Vulture Peak, with a great assemblage of twelve thousand bhik·π£us (monks), eighty thousand bodhisattva-mahƒÅsattvas, as well as gods, dragons, yak·π£as, spirits, and animals. Along with all these beings were bhik·π£u·πáƒ´s (nuns), upƒÅsakas (male laymen), upƒÅsikƒÅs (female laymen), kings, princes, ministers, rich people, ordinary people, men and women alike. The Bodhisattvas are thus called mahƒÅsattvas in the Threefold Lotus Sutra, because they have a great goal of obtaining supreme enlightenment (bodhi) and finally attaining Buddhahood by enlightening all beings. This chapter is called \\"Virtues\\" simply because all the beings in the assembly, no matter what \\"state\\" they were in, desired to praise the Buddha for his virtues (the precepts, meditation, wisdom, emancipation, and knowledge of emancipation) and excellence.Shinjo Suguro, Nichiren Buddhist International Center, trans. (1998): Introduction to the Lotus Sutra, Fremont, Calif.: Jain Publishing Company. ; pp. 6-7 In doing so, they could sow their knowledge of the Buddha deep into their minds. =Preaching= In this chapter, the Buddha addresses the Great Adornment Bodhisattva and the other eighty thousand bodhisattvas in the assembly and explains to them that this sutra makes unawakened bodhisattvas accomplish perfect enlightenment \\"quickly\\". If a bodhisattva wants to learn and master this doctrine of Innumerable Meanings, he \\"should observe that all [phenomena] were originally, will be, and are in themselves void in nature and form; they are neither great nor small, neither appearing nor disappearing, neither fixed nor movable, and neither advancing nor retreating; and they are nondualistic, just emptiness.\\" In order to realize naturally what may emerge from all laws in the future, one must first penetrate and understand them deeply. By realizing this, one can realize that all laws remain settled for a vast number of eons, but even after a vast amount of time, they change. =Ten Merits= The essence of this chapter is the urgent advice to master and practice the teaching of the sutra for the spiritual merit to be gained from it, the good life it leads to, and the usefulness to mankind and the world that it makes possible.Nikky≈ç Niwano: A Guide to the Threefold Lotus Sutra, Kosei Publishing Co 1989. Mentioned earlier in this sutra, the teachings of the Buddha are the truth of the universe. It is no wonder, and certainly no miracle, that if one lives according to the truth, his life works out well.Nikky≈ç Niwano: Buddhism for Today, A Modern Interpretation of the Threefold Lotus Sutra, Kosei Publishing Co/Weatherhill Inc; 1980. Once again, Great Adornment Bodhisattva is present in the assembly and questions the Buddha about where the teaching comes from, its dwelling place, and what purpose it serves. The Buddha answered and said that the teaching originates in the innermost mind of all the buddhas; its purpose is to propel the minds of all man-kind to seek the wisdom of the buddhas; its dwelling place is in the performance of the Bodhisattva Path by all who seek perfect enlightenment.Nikky≈ç Niwano: A Guide to the Threefold Lotus Sutra, Kosei Publishing Co 1989.

The Michigan Court of Appeals is the intermediate-level appellate court of the state of Michigan. It was created by the Michigan Constitution of 1963, and commenced operations in 1965. Its opinions are reported both in an official publication of the State of Michigan, Michigan Appeals Reports, as well as the unofficial, privately published North Western Reporter, published by West. Appeals from this court's decisions go to the Michigan Supreme Court. The court has 25 judges. Cases are heard by panels of 3 judges, similarly to the U.S. Courts of Appeals. Like most appellate courts, the Court of Appeals observes the principle of stare decisis, where a court's reasoning in its past precedents binds its present decisions. When a panel of the court disagrees with a prior precedent, it must abide by the earlier decision in deciding the case at hand. When a panel expresses its disagreement with a prior precedent, there is a mechanism to convene a special 7-member \\"conflict panel\\" (similar to the en banc procedure in the U.S. Courts of Appeals) that would resolve the conflict between the earlier decision and the expressed desire of a panel of the court's judges to depart from that precedent. The court has four districts: District I is based in Detroit, District II is based in Troy, District III is based in Grand Rapids, and District IV is based in Lansing. Each District elects six or seven judges, but the judges on the various panels are not drawn from specific districts, and the court's precedents must be consistent statewide (i.e., each district may not maintain its own precedents as in the various circuits in the federal judicial system). Because there is no connection between the district in which a case arises and the judges who sit on the panel, there are some slight differences between the election districts (which are redrawn every 10 years to maintain approximate population equality) and the case filing districts (which only are to maximize convenience). Due to the enormous geographic size of the 4th District, the court will, on occasion, schedule a panel to hear cases in a northern Michigan city (such as Marquette, Petoskey, or Traverse City), for the convenience of the parties. The court originally had only nine judges, but this number was steadily increased by the Michigan Legislature to accommodate the court's growing caseload‚Äîto 12 in 1969, to 18 in 1974, to 24 in 1988, and to 28 in 1993.

Besides the village of Stringston itself, the parish includes the settlements of Lilstock and Kilton. Administratively, the civil parish falls within the Somerset West and Taunton local government district within the Somerset shire county, with administrative tasks shared between county, district and parish councils. History The name of the village means Strenge's settlement and was part of the Acland-Hood estate. Kilton and Lilstock were separate ancient parishes, part of the Williton and Freemanners Hundred. Kilton took its name from Kilve Hill. It was first mentioned in 873, when King Alfred gave his estate at Kilton to his son Edward the Elder under his will. Kilton became a civil parish in 1866, but in 1886 was combined with Lilstock to form the civil parish of Kilton cum Lilstock, itself abolished in 1933 and absorbed into Stringston.Vision of Britain website Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the non-metropolitan district of Somerset West and Taunton, which was established on 1 April 2019.

Plot  In Sydney, Australia, a puppy named Muffin is living with a human family and his own mother. Muffin, calling himself Napoleon and pretending to be tough, wishes that he could live with the wild dogs that he can hear howling in the distance. The family has a birthday party and one of the decorations is a basket with balloons strapped to it. Out of curiosity, Napoleon hops inside, but the basket, untied from its tether, begins to float away. Napoleon flies high above the city and heads out to the sea. A galah named Birdo drops down on the side of his basket and offers to help him get down. Birdo's idea of help is to pop the balloons suspending the basket, causing Napoleon to land unharmed on a beachhead. Napoleon thinks he can finally seek out the wild dogs and heads into a nearby forest, ignoring Birdo's suggestion to return home. At night, Napoleon starts to fear being alone. A tawny frogmouth in the forest warns Napoleon of terrible things that can happen to pets in the wild, but Napoleon ignores him as well and continues on his way. He discovers a large tree used by a psychotic cat as a home. The cat spots Napoleon and, thinking he is a mouse, chases him. Napoleon escapes when the tawny frogmouth pushes the cat into a pond. The tawny frogmouth then warns Napoleon that the cat will not rest until he is dead. As Napoleon runs off, the cat pulls herself from the pond angrily swearing revenge. The next morning, Napoleon once again encounters Birdo, who decides to teach Napoleon how to live in the wild. Napoleon learns about hunting by practising on a group of rabbits, but fails to catch one and ends up eating moss instead. Birdo's next lessons about friendly and dangerous animals and snowy weather are ignored. A sudden brush fire burns a sugarcane field, but Napoleon escapes with Birdo's help. The cat returns and attempts to attack Birdo, but fails. Birdo reunites with his lost flock but the cat has found them too; Napoleon saves them with a warning of the cat. Napoleon and Birdo then part ways as Napoleon wants to seek the wild dogs and Birdo wants to rejoin his flock. Napoleon is saddened when he realises that the howling he has been hearing was just a perentie lizard. As the area begins to flood, he runs for shelter and discovers two dingo puppies inside a damp cave and assumes they are lost like him. The water floods in and sweeps away Nancy, one of the pups. Napoleon dives into the water and rescues her. The pups' mother returns and Napoleon realises that he has found the wild dogs. The mother agrees to let Napoleon live with her and her pups. While out together, the mother asks why Napoleon wanted to be with the wild dogs. He explains that he always wanted to feel brave by living in the wild, but confesses to being disappointed with the lifestyle. The mother comforts him by reminding him it was his courage that led him out here and helped him save her puppies, which represents the true spirit of the wild dogs. Wanting to go home, Napoleon takes a trip across the landscape in a kangaroo's pouch. Napoleon reaches the shore and discovers that his basket is inhabited by a feisty penguin who resembles his past self, wanting to be a wild and brave creature. That night, Napoleon's plan to sail back to the city with the basket is interrupted by the cat's return. A battle ensues and Napoleon tries multiple times to stop the cat. Before she can kill Napoleon, the cat becomes distracted by the penguin, who taunts her. Napoleon then knocks the cat off the cliff and into the basket, which sails away in the water. On a cliff side, Napoleon sees an image of a wild dog howling, symbolising that he understands his bravery of being a wild dog inside. Birdo reappears with a sea turtle who takes Napoleon back to the city. Napoleon returns home to his mother, who consents to calling him Napoleon instead of Muffin.

Director Mario Andreacchio was inspired to make the film after watching The Adventures of Milo and Otis with his children. During the shoot, 64 different dogs played the title role. Release Napoleon grossed $2,051,855 at the box office in Australia during 1995. In Japan, the film opened on 87 screens during late February under the name Kulta, Finnish for \\"gold\\". According to Andreacchio, the Japanese public mistook the original English title for a kind of brandy. It was released on VHS in the United States, with a different dub, on August 11, 1998 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Reception In the US, the film received no advance screenings for critics. It however received three stars out of four from the New York Daily News. Despite being a financial disappointment, the film has received a cult following.

After studying at Feistritz he went to Laibach (Ljubljana), where he spent nine years (1802‚Äì11) in classical, philosophical, and scientific studies, and completed his school life by a course in higher mathematics at Vienna. From 1814 to 1816 he acted as private tutor in a family in Steinbach, and whilst here he was so attracted by the life and work of the Benedictines of Kremsmunster that he finally entered their novitiate on 5 October 1816, taking the name Marian in place of his baptismal name of Wolfgang. He was ordained priest on 18 August 1821, and after three years of work in the parish of Sippachzell he was recalled to Kremsmunster to teach natural history and physics. In 1830 he was relieved of the professorship of natural history and appointed director of the astronomical observatory, a position he retained for the next seventeen years. He continued also to teach physics until 1839, when he was given general charge of the student body. His administrative abilities attracted the attention of the authorities at Vienna whither he was called in 1847. From this time on he was employed in high offices either in the University of Vienna or in the Department of Education, which was at that time undergoing a process of reconstruction. All matters pertaining to the Realschulen, and to the polytechnic, nautical, and astronomical institutions, were placed under his immediate care, and, as a mark of appreciation for his share in the reorganization of the Realschulen, the emperor bestowed on him the Cross of the Order of Leopold on 27 May 1859. In 1848 he was elected member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, and took an active part in its proceedings.

History Mindanao State University at Naawan was founded as a field laboratory of the MSU College of Fisheries under Dean Domiciano Kapili Villaluz in 1964. This field laboratory was intended to complement the MSU College of Fisheries program in freshwater aquaculture. Through the help of the Municipal government, a 15 hectare mangrove area in Naawan, Misamis Oriental was acquired for training students in the design and construction of brackishwater ponds for the culture of commercially important species of fish. At the same time, a handful of biologists under the leadership of Dean Villaluz was experimenting on the hatchery technique of producing the fry of Penaeus monodon Fabricius under laboratory conditions, the first in the world. In 1969, Dean D.K. Villaluz successful convinced the National Science Development Board (NSDB) of the bright prospect of prawn culture in the country. This led to the NSDB assistance of P37,000/year for three years to research project entitled \\"Reproduction, Larval Development and Cultivation of Sugpo, P. monodon Fab. Project.\\" With this assistance, the research team under Dean D.K. Villaluz managed to construct a pilot laboratory. This first documented successful experiment on prawn culture inspired other institutions and private investors in recent years to put up, commercial hatcheries and provided bright prospect for a new dollar-earning aquaculture industry. In 1971, the Sulu College of Technology and Oceanography was created by Republic Act No. 6060 to develop the fishery potentials of Sulu nearby waters. In line with the objectives of RA 6060, the Institute of Fisheries Research and Development was organized to purposely intensify research on fisheries with MSU-NSDB Marine Fisheries Laboratory at Naawan as its nucleus and research arm on coastal fisheries and with the SCTO Coastal Research Laboratory in Marawi City as its research arms on inland fisheries. The MSU-Institute of Fisheries Research and Development was formally organized and made a distinct unit of the Mindanao State University pursuant to a special order signed by then President Mauyag Tamano on December 4, 1973 placing the MSU Naawan Fisheries High School under its immediate supervision. At that time, the Institute program had the following main components: # Research; # Training and Extension; # Academic; #Conservation When Director Warlito M. Sanguila reorganized the administrative set-up of the Institute, the top level management of the institute consisted of the Director with three deputy-directors, namely: :* Deputy-Director for Research, :* Deputy-Director for Technology Transfer, and :* Deputy-Director for Administration and Development. Expansion of the manpower and service coverage of the Institute demanded another reorganization in 1981. The streamlining was patterned closely to the organizational set up of PCARRD. This reorganization plan was submitted to the Board of Regents and approved under BOR resolution No. 285, S. 1981 in its 108th meeting. In May 1980-81 the School of Marine Fisheries and Technology was established. This was a tertiary level joint project of the MSU-College of Fisheries and the MSU-IFRD. The MSU Board of Regents gave its seal of approval to this venture by passing BOR Resolution No. 2190, S. 1980. The School serves as the academic arm of IFRD. SMFT students have access to the laboratory facilities of IFRD and have the institute researchers as instructors. The students of the school are therefore assured not only of a strong theoretical foundation of their tasks, but are also assured of the required expertise in the application of their career in the field of fisheries. This was the assessment of a study team composed of professors from the UP College of Fisheries at Diliman, and of representatives from the Ministry of Education, Culture, and Sports (MECS) when they toured the IFRD Campus in 1985 and 1986. The group recommended that IFRD be designated as the center for Marine Sciences in Mindanao. SMFT is headed by a dean and it offers courses along its specialization; Bachelor of Science in Marine Biology, Bachelor of Science in Fisheries Major in Mariculture, Diploma in Fisheries Technology major in Fish Culture Technology and Fish Processing Technology, and a graduate program in Marine Biology. By 1981, the Institute was restructured pursuant to BOR Resolution 285 Series of 1981. In 1982 Naawan Fisheries High School was integrated with the Institute pursuant to BOR Resolution 174, Series of 1982. In 1988 MSU Naawan was formally organized as a distinct autonomous unit of the MSU System pursuant to Memorandum Orders No. 3 and no. 45 and BOR resolution 92, Series of 1988. On July 21, 1988, the first Executive Director for the Naawan campus was elected by the Board of Regents of the University. By August 5, after two weeks of dialogic consultations with the campus constituents, the Executive Director completed the revamp of the second and lower level leadership positions of the campus in accordance with its BOR approved new-organizational structure. This was immediately followed by reorientation meetings with the new set of officials where the objectives of the university and the programs to be specifically pursued and charted with mandated objectives towards, research, extension, and instruction.http://www.msunaawan.edu.ph/ Present MSU ‚Äì Naawan Today, since the founding of the MSU College of Fisheries and as a distinct unit of the MSU System, MSU Naawan holds the distinction as one of the campus that has gained both national and international prominence in fisheries research. Last January 2016, MSU Naawan received its first Center of Excellence Award in Fisheries and second Center of Development Award for Marine Science pursuant to CHED Memorandum Order no. 38 series of 2015.

Pope John XII and emperor Otto I. Antipope Clement III and emperor Henry IV. In the Middle Ages, the term universal power referred to the Holy Roman Emperor and the Pope. Both were struggling for the so-called dominium mundi, or world dominion, in terms of political and spiritual supremacy. The universal powers continued into the early 19th century until the Napoleonic Wars. The reshaping of Europe meant the effective end of the Empire. Although the Papacy had its territorial limits confined to the Vatican, it retained its soft power in the contemporary world. Origins Given the Caesaropapism of the Byzantine Empire, the situation in the Western World after the decline of the Roman Empire assumed an exceptionally powerful position of the Bishop of Rome. As the only patriarch in the Western World, his status was soon converted into that of a primate (bishop). In addition to this spiritual power, the Bishop of Rome sought to gain temporal power over a territory held by various Germanic Kingdoms in order to make it a true theocracy. The Bishop of Rome tried to extend his territory from the city of Rome to the whole of Italy and further to the whole of the Western Roman Empire (in accordance with the Donation of Constantine). The coronation of Charlemagne in the year 800, which began the Carolingian Empire, marked the appearance of a secular authority with universal claims. The two century long coexistence of the Pontiff and the Empire (regnum et sacerdocium) was difficult and yielded the Investiture Controversy and several different ideological formulations (the theory of the two swords, Plenitutdo postestatis, Dictatus papae, condemnations of simony, and nicolaism). In these the Pope tried to establish the supremacy of religious authority over civil authority. Meanwhile, the Emperor tried to enforce the legitimacy of his position, which claimed to come from the old Roman Empire (Translatio imperii). In order to do this, he established his military capability to impose his territorial power and extend his power over religious life. This was done in a manner similar to that of his equivalent in the East. Both efforts fell far short of their goals.Julio Valde√≥n Baruque y Jos√© √Ångel Garc√≠a de Cort√°zar, in FERN√ÅNDEZ √ÅLVAREZ, Manuel; AVIL√âS FERN√ÅNDEZ, Miguel y ESPADAS BURGOS, Manuel (dirs.)

Las criuzadas. Capetos y Angevinos, pp. 131‚Äì157. Evolution The division of the Carolingian Empire between the heirs of Louis the Pious and the claims of different dynasties, such as the Ottonian and the House of Hohenstaufen, to the imperial title, debilitated the power of the emperors and subjected them to a system of election. The system of election made them dependent on a delicate game of alliances between the nobles that held the title of Prince- Elector, some laymen and others clergymen. Notwithstanding, he would periodically try to regain imperial power (Otto III, Henry II). At times this led to spectacular confrontations (Henry IV, Frederick I Barbarossa, Frederick II). The strengthening of the power of the papacy was very important from Pope Gregory I on, and depended on the support of the monastic orders, above all the Order of Cluny. The constitution of many of these new kingdoms made them feudally obligated to the Pope, which liberated them from the theoretical feudal subjugation of the emperor or another king (such was the case of Portugal). In the territory of the Sacred Empire, the rivalry between the Guelphs, supporting the Papacy, and Ghibellines, supporting the Emperor, dominated German and Italian political life from the 12th to the 15th century. Eventually, the authority of the Emperor was converted into something purely theoretical, lacking a strong economic or military base. He was incapable of not only standing up to the feudal monarchies definitively free of all subordination Rex superiorem non recognoscens in regno suo est Imperator (Decretal Per Venerabilem by Innocent III, 1202),Francisco Tom√°s y Valiente et al. (1996) [Autonom√≠a y soberan√≠a. Una consideraci√≥n hist√≥rica], Madrid: Marcial Pons; cited in Revista de estudios hist√≥rico-jur√≠dicos n¬∫ 21, Valpara√≠so 1999 but to his own territorial princes or Italian city-states. The papal authority also decayed. The Crusades, advocated by the pope, did not give him more control of the briefly conquered territories in the Holy Land, the European kingdoms, or of the new religious orders. With the Avignon Papacy and the Western Schism, the French Monarchy subjugated the Papacy to its control. This further weakened the Pope's power and undermined the intimidating power of excommunication, which had been greatly feared.Julio Valde√≥n, op. cit., El siglo XIII. El fin de las construcciones universales. El auge de las monarqu√≠as nacionales, vol. 12 pp. 161‚Äì184. The production of theoretical arguments on the theme of universal power, on the other hand, continued and included contributions such as those of Marsilius of Padua, Defensor Pacis or William of Ockham, Eight Questions about the Authority of the Pope (1342) and De imperatorum et pontificum potestate (1347).Bibliographic review of this. Such works continued to undermine the universal ambitions of both authorities and were produced by the most important authors of the scholasticism crisis. The scholasticism crisis debated the adoption and extension of new legal ideas taken from Roman Law, with the jus commune of the School of Bologna on one side and conciliarism of the Counsel of Florence on the other. End Charles V was reconciled with the king Francis I of France both encouraged by pope Paul III, oil by Sebastiano Ricci. Both universal powers entered the Modern Age very debilitated, although their power continued to be notable. They tried to recoup what was lost. These attempts, however, proved unsuccessful, as in the cases of the emperor Charles VThe imperial idea of Charles V has been subject to many different interpretations about its medieval, modern, or ancient nature. The universal nature of Charles's empire, notably proposed by Karl Brandi, suggests that his Imperial idea was rooted in the medieval traditions of his advisors such as the Italian chancellor Murcurino Gattinara, his Flemish preceptor Adrian of Utrecht (future Pope Adrian VI) and the Castilians doctor Mota and monk Antonio de Guevara. The modern nature of Charles's empire has also been significantly studied since the 20th century.(Carlos V y la lengua espa√±ola by Manuel Alvar extracted from: Nebrija y estudios sobre la Edad de Oro. Madrid: C.S.I.C., 1997, pp. 169‚Äì188; which collects and briefly comments on the bibliography of the debate). Other references: File of the article by Joseph P√©rez.

A very brief reference on the subject in Kalipedia. Finally, in \\"Renaissance of Empire\\" Thomas James Dadelet has studied the Imperialism of Charles V in the framework of the general Renaissance of antiquity. and the pontiffs of the Renaissance (Julius II and Leo X) and the Counter-Reformation, whose ambitions proved impossible in the long term. The reality that was imposed during the Ancien R√©gime was that of new authoritarian monarchies (such as the Catholic Monarchy) that evolved towards absolutism (as in France) or towards the bourgeois revolutions (as in the Netherlands with the Dutch Revolt and in England with the English Civil War). In 1648 the Treaty of Westphalia definitively supplanted the role of the universal powers and brought about modern, secularized international relations based on pragmatism and the prominence of states.La evoluci√≥n del sistema interestatal desde la Paz de Westfalia hasta la Revoluci√≥n Francesa, vista desde una perspectiva anal√≠tica (The evolution of the interstatal system from the Peace of Westphalia until the French Revolution, view from an analytic perspective), that cites as a source Rosecrance, The Rise of the Trading State. Commerce and Conquest in the Modern World, New York, Basic Books, 1986. Even within Catholic countries, the theory that only monarchs could grant royalties effectively limited the pontifical power. The 19th century was the end of both universal powers as territorial entities: the Sacro Imperio was formally abolished by Napoleon Bonaparte, who created his own empire, and although Napoleon's empire was defeated, the Holy Roman Empire was not restored in the redrawing of the European map following the Congress of Vienna (1814‚Äì1815). The territories recuperated by the Habsburg dynasty were transformed into a multinational state, first as the Austrian Empire and later as a dual monarchy, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which lasted until 1918. Additionally, the leadership of Prussia in the recently created German Confederation brought about the constitution of the Second German Empire in 1871. Simultaneously, the relations of the Pope with the French Revolution and Napoleon, as with ideological liberalism itself, oscillated between direct opposition and forced coexistence. In 1860, the new Kingdom of Italy, formed by the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, conquered the Papal States' territorial base (called Marche) in the center of Italy. The Kingdom of Italy did not take Rome itself, however, until 1871 when the Second French Empire of Napoleon III withdrew its garrison in Rome which had served to protect the Papal States. The Pope's rejection of the situation and the voluntary confinement of the popes in the Vatican continued until the Lateran Pacts of 1929 with the Italian fascist Benito Mussolini. Since then, the efforts of the Pope in the international scene and in the internal business of Catholic countries have transcended the territorial dimensions of the Vatican City, demonstrating that the religious dimension is very decisive. It has also shown that what has come to be called soft power, though subtle, can be effective because of its moral, ideological, and cultural weight.

Perseverance of the term The name of \\"empire\\" has been applied to types of political entities that have not had a universal function (theocratic or Caesaropapist), but to those with a global, secularized one. This has been possible in geostrategic terms for the first time since the coming about of a global economy.Concepto de Fernand Braudel desarrollado por Immanuel Wallerstein Although the first empires to form (the Portuguese Empire and Spanish Empire in the 16th century) in their day did not refer to themselves as empires, (the Spanish self defined, in providentialist terms, as the Catholic Monarchy), the name typically has been applied by historiography (which applies \\"empire\\" to any political form of the past with multinational dimensions: Turk Empire, Mongol Empire, Inca Empire). Consequently, this is done to the Russian Empire, which claimed to be a third Rome after the fall of Constantinople in 1453 (the title Czar is derived from Caesar). The term is also applied to the overseas territorial possessions of the European states: *the British Empire ‚Äì justified by the Hindu Raj who made Queen Victoria empress of India *the French Empire ‚Äì that of the first Napoleon and that of the Third, although the name continued to be used for the colonies of the Third Republic *the Italian Empire ‚Äì that Mussolini sought in Africa Analogously, the name \\"empire\\" is also used to refer to non-European entities, such as the Chinese Empire and the Japanese Empire, or give the title of emperor to those like the Negus of Ethiopia, the Shah of Persia, and the Sultan of Morocco. pp. 56‚Äì57 In most cases, this is a \\"diplomatic courtesy.\\" Since the Cold War, it has also been common to refer to the two rival superpowers as the American Empire and the Soviet Empire.

The legend is recent in origin, and its character is so fantastic that it is not to be believed.Lanzoni, pp. 300‚Äì301. The first bishop whose date is known with certainty is Eutychius, who was present at the dedication of the Basilica of Monte Gargano in 493.Pope Gelasius is quoted as having believed that the bishop's name was Eutychius, not Eusebius. Benigni, writing in the Catholic Encyclopedia, is certainly wrong, based on the evidence, in calling the bishop Eusebius. Until the end of the tenth century Trani had certainly followed the Latin Rite, and Bishop BernardoOnly Benigni, in the Catholic Encyclopedia article on \\"Trani\\", speaks of this Bishop Bernardo, without reference. opposed the decree of the Patriarch Polyeuctes (968) introducing the Greek Rite; it is uncertain whether Joannes, bishop of Trani, who embraced the schism of Michael Caerularius and in consequence was deposed by Pope Nicholas II (1059), belonged to the Greek Rite. His successor was Delius, and thenceforward Trani continued in the Latin Rite. In 1073 Trani fell into the hands of the Normans, and Count Pierre d'Hauteville became Count of Trani, though he was quickly put down by Robert Guiscard. In 1098 Nicholas the Pilgrim, a Byzantine Christian, died there; under another Byzantine the new cathedral was dedicated to that saint. Bertrand II (1157‚Äì87) tried to arrange a Byzantine‚ÄìSicilian marriage alliance. Samarus was granted the lordship of the Jews of Trani by Emperor Henry VI for his support against Tancred. Bartolommeo Brancacci (1328) distinguished himself on several embassies and was chancellor of the Kingdom of Naples. In 1455 the diocese of Cannae (Italian Canne) was united with that of Nazareth. Cannae was destroyed in 1083 by Robert Guiscard, with the exception of the cathedral and the episcopal residence. It had bishops in the sixth century, for Gregory the Great entrusted the see to the care of the bishop of Siponto; its bishops are again mentioned after the tenth century. In 1534 Cannae was separated from Nazareth and united to the diocese of Monteverde, but in 1552 the united dioceses were incorporated with Nazareth. In 1860 the See of Nazareth (Barletta) was united with Trani, the archbishop of which had been appointed in 1818 perpetual administrator of the see of Bisceglie. With the See of Trani is united the ancient diocese of Salpe (Salapia of the Greeks), its known bishops comprising Palladius (465) and 23 successors before the definitive union in 1547. Another is the see of Carnia, which had bishops before the time Gregory, who entrusted it to the care of the Bishop of Reggio Calabria; in 649 it had a new ordinary, but later the city fell into decay.

On 30 October 1130, while visiting Trani, Anacletus confirmed the possessions and privileges of Hubaldus Archbishop of Trani, and granted him and his successors the use of the pallium. Prologo, Le carte de Trani, p. 77. The coronation at Palermo took place on Christmas Day, 1130. The information about a putative Archbishop Veterandus is defective. If one considers the document in Kehr, p. 292 no. 8, as authentic, then Veterandus's episcopate is impossible. *Hubaldus (attested 1130 to 1138)Kehr, p. 292 no. 8, labels one piece of evidence for Hubaldus, that of 1120, a forgery. *Bisantius (attested 1150)On 4 July 1144 Bisantius was Bishop-elect.

It is published by the Liechtensteiner Volksblatt AG, and as of 2015, had a circulation of 9,000 copies. The Thursday edition is distributed as a large print run, with an estimated circulation of 21,000 copies. [1] The editorial office is located in Schaan.  History  The newspaper was first published on 16 August 1878 [2] as the Press Association Liechtensteiner Volksblatt. The Royal Chaplain Johann Fetz was the founder and first editor, serving in that capacity until 1884.[3] Up until 1918, it was published as a weekly newspaper, until it began printing twice weekly until 1919. The company gradually increased its rate of publication, from three editions per week starting in 1927, expanding to four in 1962, and then five times a week in 1978. Since January 1985, the paper has printed every day, except Sunday. The Oberland newspaper is generally considered to have a conservative outlook, and regularly agrees with the positions of the reigning Prince of Liechtenstein, and the Progressive Citizens' Party. Since September 2006, the paper has been published by \\"Liechtensteiner Volksblatt AG\\", a private publishing house which emerged from the former Press Club. In October 2006, the Vorarlberg media entrepreneur Eugen Russ (Vorarlberger Medienhaus) [4] also holds a minority stake in the publishing house. The majority shares are still in possession of the Royal Family of Liechtenstein. The Liechtensteiner Volksblatt is financed through subscriptions and the sale of advertisements. The newspaper is published in the German language, and is primarily covers current affairs in Liechtenstein, though also providing some coverage of Switzerland and Austria.  Structure  The Liechtensteiner Volksblatt is usually organised into eight sections: * The title page, with current news * News in Liechtenstein * European politics, as well as some global coverage * Business and financial section * Sports * Culture and arts * Weather and industry advertisements * Panorama  Literature  * Wilfried Marxer: Media in Liechtenstein: structural analysis of the media landscape in a small state.

Enrico Mart√≠nez: Cosm√≥grafo e impresor de Nueva Espa√±a. Mexico, 1943.Valerie Mathes, \\"Enrico Martinez of New Spain,\\" The Americas 33, 1976, pp. 62-77. According to some he was of Spanish descent; Alexander von Humboldt says that he was either a German or Dutchman, and according to others a Mexican educated in Spain, but in all probability he was a Frenchman, Henri Mart√≠n hispanicized under the form of Enrico Mart√≠n or Mart√≠nez. In 1607 the Viceroy Don Luis de Velasco entrusted to him the difficult task of draining the valley surrounding Mexico City. The valley formed a closed basin, and when the rains were heavy the Lakes of Zumpango and San Crist√≥bal rose higher than that of Texcoco and overflowed into the basin, inundating the city and threatening it with destruction. Mart√≠nez' plan was to open a canal as outlet to the Lake of Zumpango to prevent its overflow. The work began on 28 November 1607, and was terminated by 13 May 1609. Corrosion and the constant action of the water caused caving-in in the interior of the tunnel, and obstructed the passage to such an extent that, during the viceregency of Archbishop Fray Garc√≠a Guerra (1611‚Äì12), in reply to the inquiry made by Philip III for information concerning the utility of the work, the amount so far expended, and what would still be required to complete it, the archbishop and the municipal government replied that the work done by Mart√≠nez was not sufficient to place the city beyond the danger of inundations and that $413,325 had been expended and 1,126,650 workmen engaged in the work. Mart√≠nez wrote to the king contradicting this information.W.M. Mathes, \\"To Save a City: The Desag√ºe of Mexico-Huehuetoca, 1607,\\" The Americas 26, April 1970. The viceroy, Don Diego Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, Marques de Guadalc√°zar (1612‚Äì21), the successor of Fray Garc√≠a Guerra, was sent from Spain with special instructions concerning the work of the draining of the valley. At the same time Philip III commissioned the Spanish ambassador to the Court of France, Don √ç√±igo Contreras, to find a competent engineer for the work and the Dutchman Adrian Boot, who arrived in Mexico in 1614, was selected. At the suggestion of the viceroy, Boot with Mart√≠nez and the auditor Otalora visited the works and each made a report. Boot reported that Mart√≠nez' canal called Huehuetoca or Nochistongo was inadequate and presented plans for a new work which would cost $185,900; Mart√≠nez offered with 300 men and $100,000 to finish the work, and to moreover divert into the course of the canal the waters of the River Cuauhtitlan, which, when it rose, overflowed into the valley of Mexico. Boot's plan was rejected, and that presented by Mart√≠nez was accepted with the king's approval. The royal approbation was obtained 3 April 1616, and Mart√≠nez received his instructions to begin the work at once. In 1623 when the work was still in an unfinished state the Viceroy the Marquis de Gelvez (1621‚Äì24) to test the utility of the canal directed the work to be suspended and the waters, including that of the River Cuauhtitlan, which was then discharging through the tunnel, to be once more diverted into the lakes of the valley. This caused a flood in 1627 and the municipal government petitioned the Viceroy Cerralvo (1624‚Äì35) to rectify the trouble and avert a disaster. The viceroy entrusted the matter to Boot, Mart√≠nez, and several others who had studied the situation, and all submitted reports. Between disputes and meetings the time up to 1629 was lost and the mouth of Mart√≠nez tunnel having become practically obstructed, the waters of the Cuauhtitlan overflowed into the Lake of Zumpango and Mexico City was placed in great peril. The viceroy had Mart√≠nez arrested and imprisoned on the charge of having purposely closed the mouth of the tunnel, to which he replied that the lack of funds had prevented the repairs being made in the roof of the tunnel, and that the portions that had caved in had impeded the flow of the water. A few days later (21 September 1629) he was released and the work of repairing the tunnel put into his hands. It was, however, too late, as the following day a great flood occurred, water rising in the city proper to the height of two metres. The ravages of the water were terrible, the greater portion of the houses were rendered uninhabitable, and according to some historians 30,000 persons lost their lives. Some years later the auditor, Don Juan de Villabona Cubiaurre, was appointed chief superintendent of the work and submitted an unfavourable report on the work of Mart√≠nez. In 1789 the tunnel was converted into an open canal. At the turn of the twentieth Century an entirely new project was carried out by which the waters of the valley discharge through the Tequixquiac tunnel.New York Times, 1888Louisa Schell Hoberman, \\"Bureaucracy and Disaster: Mexico City and the Flood of 1629,\\" Journal of Latin American Studies, 6(2), November 1974, pp. 211-230.

However, according to a conflicting source, Simon of K√©za (writing about five to eight decades later), El≈ëd was the father of √Ålmos, while the chronicler referred to √úgyek as √Ålmos' grandfather. He is the earliest known ancestor of the √Årp√°d dynasty. Life √úgyek was born in the last third of the 8th century.B. Szab√≥-Sud√°r 2017. p. 226. Anonymus writes that √úgyek married Emese, a daughter of \\"Prince Eunedubelian\\" in 819. She had seen a divine dream of a Turul bird before √Ålmos's birth in c. 820, according to the chronicles. The Turul's role is interpreted as guardian spirit, who protects the baby from harm until he grows up. It is supported by the chronicles, according to whom the Turul appears to the already pregnant woman. Historian Gyula Krist√≥ said √úgyek's name may have been the chronicler' invention, since it derives from the ancient Hungarian √ºgy (\\"saint, holy\\") word. It is said, speculated or at least possible that the earlier Grand Princes of the Hungarians were also descendants of the Hun Khans, as well as other Turkic peoples, and through them from some daughters of Emperors of China. Simon of K√©za's Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum narrated that royal lineage that makes Hunnic ruler Attila the sixth-generation ancestor of √Årp√°d, conqueror of the Pannonian Basin, through Attila's son Csaba, his son Ed, his son √úgyek, his son El≈ëd, his son √Ålmos. √Ålmos was ruler of the Magyars and the father of √Årp√°d.  Meaning of the name  Anonymus gives the name as Vgec; this caused much speculation later, as to the meaning of it. The latest researchB. Szab√≥-Sud√°r 2017. on the subject gives the following explanations regarding the origin and meaning of the name: * √úgyek - Dezs≈ë Pais, in his book of 1926,Magyar Anonymus 1926, 146 put forward the idea that the name is to be derived from the Hungarian word igy/egy (‚Äõholy‚Äô). Gyula Krist√≥ also shared this view. * √ñge/√úge - Turk dignitary name, according to historian Gy√∂rgy Gy√∂rffy. The meaning of it is \\"wise\\" and \\"sage\\", also \\"councillor\\". The word is also used by the uyghurs. * √úge - The last ruler of the Uyghur Empire, also a contemporary to √úgyek. He was murdered in 846 in the Altai Mountains.Dromp, M. R.: Tang China and the Collapse of the Uighur Empire: A Documentary History. Leiden 2005. It is speculated, that when the Empire fell apart, some Uyghur fragments could have escaped westward.  Significance  There are three types of great ancestry in the traditional steppe culture.Sud√°r Bal√°zs: Az √Årp√°dok, Attila √©s a dinasztikus hagyom√°nyok. Sz√°zadok 150:2 (2016) 431‚Äì441 # The distant, 'spiritual' ancestor, who took an important step, but the real power of his dynasty came many generations later; # The founder of an empire, that is inherited by the descendants; # Someone important in the family tree, related to whom the descendants must define themselves. √úgyek clearly belongs to the first group.B. Szab√≥-Sud√°r 2017. Also telling is the fact, what other people belong here: Ertogrul, (father of Osman), Sheikh Safi (founder of the Safavids), Saman Khuda (founder of the Samanids), among many others.B. Szab√≥- Sud√°r 2017. Family tree √úgyek's son or grandson √Ålmos, the first ruler of the Hungarians √Ålmos' son √Årp√°d, who conquered the Carpathian Basin The family tree contains both the contradictory reports of Anonymus and Simon K√©zai. Majority of the historians accept Anonymus' concept which suggests √úgyek was the father of √Ålmos. ReferencesSources * B.

It was also known as the Scuola Grande di Santa Maria della Misericordia. It was erected in 1310 and subsequently enlarged several times; in Venice a scuola was the seat of a charity/religious institution. By the early 16th century, the old church had joined with the nearby Franciscan abbey, and the old meeting hall had been rented out. Construction of a new Scuola meeting hall, the Scuola Nuova della Misericordia was begun in 1507 across the Rio dell Sensa. However, 25 years later this was only a foundation, and new designs by Jacopo Sansovino completed the two story brick structure. This was never faced with marble or stone, and sold in 1634 to the guild of silk weavers. The Scuola Nuova has been recently restored.En Venezia website on restoration.

Belgian singer and composer Luc Smets joined the group in 1975. The group is known for representing the Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest 1970 and Belgium in the Eurovision Song Contest 1977.  History  The Hearts of Soul and composer Pieter Goemans after winning the Nationaal Songfestival The Hearts of Soul at the Eurovision Song Contest 1970 = Early career = The sisters Maessen started their career in 1969 as backing vocalists for Dutch singer Rob de Nijs at the Nationaal Songfestival, the Dutch national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest, performing the song \\"Zaterdagavondshow\\". Shortly after, the group released their debut single \\"Oh What a Price\\", followed by their debut album Hearts of Soul later that year. In 1970, the group returned to the Nationaal Songfestival, this time with their own entry \\"Waterman\\", written by Pieter Goemans. They went on to win the competition, which gave them the right to represent the Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest 1970, held in Amsterdam. At the time, the rules of the Eurovision Song Contest did not allow groups to compete, so Patricia performed as a solo singer, while Bianca and Stella joined her on stage as backing vocalists. They received a total of seven points from the international juries, finishing seventh out of twelve participants. From 1971 onwards, the sisters worked as session singers for several artists, including Dusty Springfield and Rika Zara√Ø. They also provided backing vocals for the Belgian singer Will Tura. = Success in Belgium = Bianca, Patricia and Stella moved to Antwerp in 1973, because there was more work for them in Belgium. In 1975, Bianca's boyfriend (and future husband) Luc Smets, a former member of the Belgian band The Pebbles, joined the group to form Dream Express. In the summer of 1976, their debut single \\"Dream Express\\" reached number two in the Flemish charts. In 1977, they entered Eurosong, the Belgian national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest, with the songs \\"A Million in One, Two, Three\\", \\"Sold It for a Song\\" and \\"Spinning Top\\". Their entry \\"A Million in One, Two, Three\\" went on to win the final and was thereby chosen to represent Belgium in the Eurovision Song Contest 1977, held in London, United Kingdom. This was the first time that Belgium entered the contest with a song that was sung entirely in English. The group received a total of 69 points, finishing in seventh place out of eighteen participating countries. After Patricia decided to leave the group, Dream Express changed its name to LBS (an acronym for Luc, Bianca and Stella) in 1979. Their singles \\"LBS\\" and \\"Uncle Jim\\" received much airplay in 1979. The group broke up in 1981, due to the divorce of Luc and Bianca. = Solo careers = After the breakup of LBS, Bianca pursued a solo career, releasing singles throughout the 1980s. In 1982, Stella released a solo album under the stage name Stella Mason. She represented Belgium in the Eurovision Song Contest 1982 with the song \\"Si tu aimes ma musique\\", reaching fourth place out of eighteen participants. At the Eurovision Song Contest 1986, Patricia provided backing vocals for the winning entry \\"J'aime la vie\\", performed by Sandra Kim. In the 1987 edition, she was a backing vocalist for Plastic Bertrand, representing Luxembourg. Patricia Maessen died on 15 May 1996 in Mortsel, Belgium at the age of 44, from the effects of a stroke. = Comeback = In September 2010, the Hearts of Soul released the single \\"Suddenly You\\". The group now consisted of Bianca, Stella and younger sister Doreen Maessen.

Born in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear he represented England at youth level whilst a trainee at Sunderland and also had a spell in Swedish football. Career=Sunderland= Arnott was a talented midfielder with excellent vision and ball control, who came to prominence during Sunderland's First Division campaign in the 1976‚Äì77 season. He was one of a trio of young players to emerge that season, along with Gary Rowell and Shaun Elliott and remained a key player for several years, helping the team to promotion in 1980. With the arrival of new manager Alan Durban however, Arnott fell out of favour and was loaned to Blackburn Rovers for a spell in 1981 before being placed on the transfer list valued at ¬£350,000. =Sheffield United= Despite a sizable price tag being placed on him by Sunderland Arnott eventually joined Sheffield United on a free transfer, signed by his former Sunderland teammate and now Blades manager Ian Porterfield in 1982. Arriving at the start of the season he struggled to make an impact, spending most of the campaign out on loan, initially to Blackburn once more followed by a spell at Rotherham United. The following season however, Arnott came into his own and was virtually ever present as United gained promotion from the then Third Division. Arnott remained at Bramall Lane until his release in 1987, making over 150 appearances for the South Yorkshire club in all competitions. =Vasalunds and Chesterfield= After leaving Sheffield United he signed for Swedish side Vasalunds but again spent much of his time on loan, initially playing indoor soccer in Dallas before returning to England with Chesterfield. His move to Saltergate was made permanent in the summer of 1988 and he remained there until a knee injury put an end to his league playing career. Post professional career Arnott continued to play non-league football for a period after his retirement, turning out for Gateshead and Hebburn. He later worked in his family building business in South Wearside.

The apse of the church faces the Grand Canal (Venice), between the Palazzo Labia and the Palazzo Flangini. The edifice is popular as the seat of the cult of Saint Lucy of Syracuse, whose remains are housed inside. History The first church was erected here in the 11th century, and was later rebuilt on several occasions. In 1206 it is mentioned to house the remains of St. Magnus of Oderzo (died 670), who had taken refuge in this area from the Lombards. The church of San Geremia in Venice hit by the Austrian bombardment of 1849. A first rebuilding was held under doge Sebastiano Ziani, the new church being consecrated in 1292. The current edifice dates from 1753, designed by Carlo Corbellini; the fa√ßade is from 1861. The brickwork bell tower (probably dating from the 12th century) has two thin Romanesque mullioned windows at the base. The church was damaged by Austrian shelling during their successful siege of the city in 1849 during the First Italian War of Independence. Interior San Geremia interior The interior has rather sober walls. The altar and its presbytery are notable, with two statues of St. Peter and St. Jeremy Apostle (1798) by Giovanni Ferrari. The altar background has a monochrome fresco by Agostino Mengozzi Colonna depicting Two Angels uphold the Globe. A work by Palma the Younger (The Virgin at the Incoronation of Venice by St. Magnus) decorates the fourth altar. The church contains statuary by Giovanni Maria Morlaiter (Madonna of the Rosary) and Giovanni Marchiori (Immaculate Conception). The church is object of pilgrimages and wide devotion for the presence of the relics of Saint Lucy, which were carried here in 1861 when the nearby church dedicated to her was demolished. In 1955 Angelo Roncalli, future Pope John XXIII and then Patriarch of Venice, had a silver mask put on the saint's face to protect it from dust. The saint's body was stolen on November 7, 1981, but was restored in December of the same year without any ransom.

The conjecture sets up a situation in which a monopolist sells a durable good to a market where resale is impossible and faces consumers who have different valuations. The conjecture proposes that a monopolist that does not know individuals' valuations will have to sell its product at a low price if the monopolist tries to separate consumers by offering different prices in different periods. This is because the monopoly is, in effect, in price competition with itself over several periods and the consumer with the highest valuation, if he is patient enough, can simply wait for the lowest price. Thus the monopolist will have to offer a competitive price in the first period which will be low. The conjecture holds only when there is an infinite time horizon, as otherwise a possible action for the monopolist would be to announce a very high price until the second to last period, and then sell at the static monopoly price in the last period. The monopolist could avoid this problem by committing to a stable linear pricing strategy or adopting other business strategies.https://ssrn.com/abstract=496175 [Orbach (2004) Simple two- consumer model Imagine there are consumers, called X and Y with valuations of good with x and y respectively. The valuations are such as x. The monopoly cannot directly identify individual consumers but it knows that there are 2 different valuations of a good. The good being sold is durable so that once a consumer buys it, he or she will still have it in all subsequent periods. This means that after the monopolist has sold to all consumers, there can be no further sales. Also assume that production is such that average cost and marginal cost are both equal to zero. The monopolist could try to charge at a \\\\text{price} = y in the first period and then in the second period \\\\text{price} =x , hence price discriminating. This will not result in consumer Y buying in the first period because, by waiting, she could get price equal to x. To make consumer Y indifferent between buying in the first period or the second period, the monopolist will have to charge a price of \\\\text{price} = dx +(1-d)y where d is a discount factor between 0 and 1. This price is such as dx + (1-d)y < y. Hence by waiting, Y forces the monopolist to compete on price with its future self. n consumers Imagine there are n consumers with valuations ranging from y to a valuation just above zero. The monopolist will want to sell to the consumer with the lowest valuation. This is because production is costless and by charging a price just above zero it still makes a profit. Hence to separate the consumers, the monopoly will charge first consumer (1-d^n)y where n is the number of consumers. If the discount factor is high enough this price will be close to zero. Hence the conjecture is proved.

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Zvezdara.  Location  Slavujev Venac is located in the easternmost section of Zvezdara municipality, bordering the municipality of Palilula. It is located between the streets of Svetog Nikole on the north and Dimitrija Tucoviƒáa on the south and borders the neighborhoods of Bulbuder on the east, Vukov Spomenik on the south, Had≈æipopovac (in Palilula) on the west and New Cemetery (Novo groblje) on the north (and Bogoslovija further).  Characteristics  Slavujev Venac got its name after nightingales, which apparently were abundant in the area as the two nearby neighborhoods (Bulbuder and Slavujev Potok) are also named after them (Serbian slavuj, Turkish b√ºlb√ºl). The creek which used to flow through the neighborhood has been conducted underground into the sewage system. It was named Slavujev potok or Bulbulderski potok and originated near the clinical center Zvezdara. It flew down in the direction of the moderns streets of Dimitrija Tucoviƒáa, Ruzveltova and Mije Kovaƒçeviƒáa, before emptying into the Danube east of the present location of the Panƒçevo Bridge. A small bridge was built over the creek in the 19th century, on the route of the modern Ruzveltova Street, on the western border of the neighborhood. Original wooden bridge was replaced with the stone one in 1929, and today there is a modern overpass. The bridge was replaced mainly to make easier access to the Belgrade New Cemetery, further down the Ruzveltova Street, Old bridge was often getting covered in ice during the winter and numerous accidents were recorded. Originally, an overpass was built above the stream (modern overpass is part of the Ruzveltova Street). In time, the stream was conducted underground, into the sewage, and the underpass was turned into the traffic continuation between the Dimitrija Tucoviƒáa and Cvijiƒáeva streets, forming a leveled intersection with the Ruzveltova and establishing a direct connection between the neighborhoods of Slavujev Potok and Had≈æipopovac. Local community of Slavujev Potok, which covers the neighborhood, had a population of 5,066 by the 2011 census. The area is residential. In 2007, Belgrade city government confirmed that area remains scheduled for the individual residential (family) houses only, to prevent construction of high and large buildings so that area could preserve its historical looks.

The dioxygenases () catalyze the oxidation of a substrate without the reduction of one oxygen atom from dioxygen into a water molecule. However, this definition is ambiguous because it does not take into account how many substrates are involved in the reaction. The majority of dioxygenases fully incorporate dioxygen into a single substrate, and a variety of cofactor schemes are utilized to achieve this. For example, in the Œ±-ketoglutarate- dependent enzymes, one atom of dioxygen is incorporated into two substrates, with one always being Œ±-ketoglutarate, and this reaction is brought about by a mononuclear iron center. Iron-containing enzymes The most widely observed cofactor involved in dioxygenation reactions is iron, but the catalytic scheme employed by these iron-containing enzymes is highly diverse. Iron-containing dioxygenases can be subdivided into three classes on the basis of how iron is incorporated into the active site: those employing a mononuclear iron center, those containing a Rieske [2Fe-2S] cluster, and those utilizing a heme prosthetic group. =Mononuclear iron dioxygenases= The mononuclear iron dioxygenases, or non-heme iron-dependent dioxygenases as they are also termed, all utilize a single catalytic iron to incorporate either one or both atoms of dioxygen into a substrate. Despite this common oxygenation event, the mononuclear iron dioxygenases are diverse in how dioxygen activation is used to promote certain chemical reactions. For instance, carbon-carbon bond cleavage, fatty acid hydroperoxidation, carbon-sulfur bond cleavage, and thiol oxidation are all reactions catalyzed by mononuclear iron dioxygenases. Most mononuclear iron dioxygenases are members of the cupin superfamily in which the overall domain structure is described as a six-stranded Œ≤-barrel fold (or jelly roll motif). At the center this barrel structure is a metal ion, most commonly ferrous iron, whose coordination environment is frequently provided by residues in two partially conserved structural motifs: G(X)5HXH(X)3-4E(X)6G and G(X)5-7PXG(X)2H(X)3N. Two important groups of mononuclear, non-heme iron dioxygenases are catechol dioxygenases and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent dioxygenases. The catechol dioxygenases, some of the most well-studied dioxygenase enzymes, use dioxygen to cleave a carbon-carbon bond of an aromatic catechol ring system. Catechol dioxygenases are further classified as being ‚Äúextradiol‚Äù or ‚Äúintradiol,‚Äù and this distinction is based on mechanistic differences in the reactions (figures 1 & 2). Intradiol enzymes cleave the carbon-carbon bond between the two hydroxyl groups. The active ferric center is coordinated by four protein ligands‚Äîtwo histidine and two tyrosinate residues‚Äîin a trigonal bipyramidal manner with a water molecule occupying the fifth coordination site. Once a catecholate substrate binds to the metal center in a bidentate fashion through the deprotonated hydroxyl groups, the ferric iron ‚Äúactivates‚Äù the substrate by means of abstracting an electron to produce a radical on the substrate. This then allows for reaction with dioxygen and subsequent intradiol cleavage to occur through a cyclic anhydride intermediate. Extradiol members utilize ferrous iron as the active redox state, and this center is commonly coordinated octahedrally through a 2-His-1-Glu motif with labile water ligands occupying empty positions. Once a substrate binds to the ferrous center, this promotes dioxygen binding and subsequent activation. This activated oxygen species then proceeds to react with the substrate ultimately cleaving the carbon-carbon bond adjacent to the hydroxyl groups through the formation of an Œ±-keto lactone intermediate. In the 2OG-dependent dioxygenases, ferrous iron (Fe(II)) is also coordinated by a (His)2(Glu/Asp)1 \\"facial triad\\" motif. Bidentate coordination of 2OG and water completes a pseudo-octahedral coordination sphere. Following substrate binding, the water ligand is released, yielding an open coordination site for oxygen activation. Upon oxygen binding, a poorly understood transformation occurs during which 2OG is oxidatively decarboxylated to succinate and the O-O bond is cleaved to form a Fe(IV)-oxo (ferryl) intermediate. This powerful oxidant is then utilized to carry out various reactions, including hydroxylation, halogenation, and demethylation. In the best characterized case, the hydroxylases, the ferryl intermediate abstracts a hydrogen atom from the target position of the substrate, yielding a substrate radical and Fe(III)-OH. This radical then couples to the hydroxide ligand, producing the hydroxylated product and the Fe(II) resting state of the enzyme. =Rieske dioxygenases= The Rieske dioxygenases catalyze the cis-dihydroxylation of arenes to cis-dihydro-diol products. These enzymes are prominently found in soil bacteria such as Pseudomonas, and their reactions constitute the initial step in aromatic hydrocarbon biodegradation. Rieske dioxygenases are structurally more complex than other dioxygenases due to the need for an efficient electron transfer pathway (figure 2) to mediate the additional, simultaneous two-electron reduction of the aromatic substrate. Figure 2. Electron transfer mechanism of Rieske dioxygenases A catalytically-competent Rieske dioxygenase has three components: an NADH-dependent FAD reductase, a ferredoxin with two [2Fe-2S] Rieske clusters, and an Œ±3Œ≤3 oxygenase with each Œ±-subunit containing a mononuclear iron center and a [2Fe-2S] Rieske cluster. Within each Œ±-subunit, the iron-sulfur cluster and mononuclear iron center are separated by a distance of some ~43 √Ö, much too far for efficient electron transfer to occur. Instead, it is proposed electron transfer is mediated through these two centers in adjacent subunits, that the iron-sulfur cluster of one subunit transfers electrons to the mononuclear iron center of the adjacent subunit which is conveniently separated by ~12 √Ö. While this distance would appear optimal for efficient electron transfer, replacement of the bridging aspartate residue causes a loss of enzyme function, suggesting that electron transfer instead proceeds through the hydrogen-bonding network held in place by this aspartate residue. Active site of Rieske dioxygenase (naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase from Rhodococcus sp.) (PDB 2B1X) The mechanistic picture for this class of dioxygenases is not yet clear, but there is evidence supporting an iron(III) hydroperoxy intermediate in the reaction pathway. This species could represent the active oxidant, or it could undergo hemolytic O-O bond cleavage to yield an iron(V)-oxo intermediate as the working oxidizing agent. The Rieske dioxygenase are a powerful class of redox-active enzymes, and reactions such as sulfoxidation, desaturation, and benzylic oxidation have been reported in addition to dioxygenation. =Heme-containing dioxygenases= While most iron-dependent dioxygenases utilize a non-heme iron cofactor, the oxidation of L-(and D-)tryptophan to N-formylkynurenine is catalyzed by either tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) or indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which are heme dioxygenases that utilize iron coordinated by a heme B prosthetic group. While these dioxygenases are of interest in part because they uniquely use heme for catalysis, they are also of interest due to their importance in tryptophan regulation in the cell, which has numerous physiological implications. The initial association of the substrate with the dioxygen-iron in the enzyme active site is thought to either proceed via radical or electrophilic addition, requiring either ferrous iron or ferric iron, respectively. While the exact reaction mechanism for the heme-dependent dioxygenases is still under debate, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through either a dioxetane or Criegee mechanism (figures 4, 5). Cambialistic dioxygenases While iron is by far the most prevalent cofactor used for enzymatic dioxygenation, it is not required by all dioxygenases for catalysis. Quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase (quercetinase, QueD) catalyzes the dioxygenolytic cleavage of quercetin to 2-protocatechuoylphloroglucinolcarboxylic acid and carbon monoxide. The most characterized enzyme, from Aspergillus japonicus, requires the presence of copper, and bacterial quercetinases have been discovered that are quite promiscuous (cambialistic) in their requirements of a metal center, with varying degrees of activity reported with substitution of divalent manganese, cobalt, iron, nickel and copper. (Quercetin, role in metabolism). Acireductone (1,2-dihydroxy-5-(methylthio)pent-1-en-3-one) dioxygenase (ARD) is found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. ARD enzymes from most species bind ferrous iron and catalyze the oxidation of acireductone to 4-(methylthio)-2-oxobutanoate, the Œ±-keto acid of methionine, and formic acid. However, ARD from Klebsiella oxytoca catalyzes an additional reaction when nickel(II) is bound: it instead produces 3-(methylthio)propionate, formate, and carbon monoxide from the reaction of acireductone with dioxygen. The activity of Fe-ARD is closely interwoven with the methionine salvage pathway, in which the methylthioadenosine product of cellular S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM) reactions is eventually converted to acireductone. While the exact role of Ni-ARD is not known, it is suspected to help regulate methionine levels by acting as a shunt in the salvage pathway. This K. oxytoca enzyme represents a unique example whereby the metal ion present dictates which reaction is catalyzed. The quercetinases and ARD enzymes all are members of the cupin superfamily, to which the mononuclear iron enzymes also belong. The metal coordination scheme for the QueD enzymes is either a 3-His or 3-His-1-Glu with the exact arrangement being organism-specific. The ARD enzymes all chelate the catalytic metal (either Ni or Fe) through the 3-His-1-Glu motif. In these dioxygenases, the coordinating ligands are provided by both of the typical cupin motifs. In the ARD enzymes, the metal exists in an octahedral arrangement with the three histidine residues comprising a facial triad. The bacterial quercetinase metal centers typically have a trigonal bipyramidal or octahedral coordination environment when there are four protein ligands; the metal centers of the copper-dependent QueD enzymes possesses a distorted tetrahedral geometry in which only the three conserved histidine residues provide coordination ligands. Empty coordination sites in all metal centers are occupied by aqua ligands until these are displaced by the incoming substrate. The ability of these dioxygenases to retain activity in the presence of other metal cofactors with wide ranges of redox potentials suggests the metal center does not play an active role in the activation of dioxygen. Rather, it is thought the metal center functions to hold the substrate in the proper geometry for it to react with dioxygen. In this respect, these enzymes are reminiscent of the intradiol catechol dioxygenases whereby the metal centers activate the substrate for subsequent reaction with dioxygen. Cofactor-independent dioxygenases Figure 5. QDO Catalytic Mechanism Dioxygenases that catalyze reactions without the need for a cofactor are much more rare in nature than those that do require them. Two dioxygenases, 1H-3-hydroxy-4-oxo-quinoline 2,4-dioxygenase (QDO) and 1H-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinaldine 2,4-dioxygenase (HDO), have been shown to require neither an organic or metal cofactor. These enzymes catalyze the degradation of quinolone heterocycles in a manner similar to quercetin dioxygenase, but are thought to mediate a radical reaction of a dioxygen molecule with a carbanion on the substrate (figure 5). Both HDO and QDO belong to the Œ±/Œ≤ hydrolase superfamily of enzymes, although the catalytic residues in HDO and QDO do not seem to serve the same function as they do in the rest of the enzymes in the Œ±/Œ≤ hydrolase superfamily. Clinical significance Due to the degree of diversity in the dioxygenase family, dioxygenases have a wide range of influences in biology: * Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) is important for regulating the levels of tryptophan in the body and is expressed in a high number of human tumors. The other heme iron-dependent dioxygenase, IDO, also has relevance to human health, as it functions in inflammatory responses in the context of certain diseases. Since it affects levels of both tryptophan and kynurenine, IDO has also been implicated in influencing systems related to depression in humans. * Alkaptonuria is a genetic disease that results in a deficiency of homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase, which is responsible for catalyzing the formation of 4-maleylacetoacetate from homogentisate. Buildup of homogentisic acid can result in heart valve damage, kidney stones and damage to cartilage in the body. * Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) is an autosomal recessive disorder that can lead to the development of iron granules and Lewy bodies in neurons. A study has shown that patients diagnosed with PKAN were found to have increased cysteine levels in the globus pallidus as a consequence of a cysteine dioxygenase deficiency. Patients with PKAN often develop symptoms of dementia and often die at an early age in adulthood. * In DNA repair, the Fe (II)/2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase AlkB, functions in the oxidative removal of alkylation damage to DNA. Failure to remove DNA alkylation damage can result in cytotoxicity or mutagenesis during DNA replication. * Cyclooxygenases (COX), which are responsible for forming prostanoids in the human body, are the target of many NSAID pain relievers. Inhibition of COX leads to reduced inflammation and has an analgesic effect, due to the lowered level of prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis.

He works primarily on figurative sculpture in clay within the neoclassical tradition. Stoddart is best known for his civic monuments, including bronze statues of David Hume and Adam Smith, philosophers during the Scottish Enlightenment, on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh, and others of James Clerk Maxwell, William Henry Playfair and John Witherspoon. Stoddart says of his own motivation, \\"My great ambition is to do sculpture for Scotland\\", primarily through large civic monuments to figures from the country's past. Stoddart was born in Edinburgh and raised in Renfrewshire, where he developed an early interest in the arts and music, and later trained in fine art at the Glasgow School of Art (1976‚Äì1980) and read the History of Art at the University of Glasgow. During this time he became increasingly critical of contemporary trends in art, such as pop art, and concentrated on creating figurine pieces in clay. Stoddart associates the lack of form in modern art with social decay; in contrast, his works include many classical allusions. Biography=Early life= Stoddart's grandfather was an evangelical Baptist preacher, and his parents met through that church.Jack, Ian. Set in stone. The Guardian. 6 June 2009. Retrieved 1 November 2010. He was born in Edinburgh, though his father, also an artist, moved the family to the village of Elderslie in Renfrewshire, where the young Stoddart immediately noticed the monument there at William Wallace's purported birthplace. Today, Stoddart lives and works in nearby Paisley. At school Stoddart became interested in music (and remains so) but decided he was not good enough to become a professional. =Education= Stoddart went, aged seventeen, to train in fine art at the Glasgow School of Art where he studied from 1976 to 1980. There he settled on sculpture and initially worked within the modernist idiom. Stoddart has recalled an epiphany moment several times: when, after finishing a riveted metal pop-art sculpture (praised by his tutors) he found a bust of the Apollo Belvedere, \\"I thought my pop-riveted thing was rubbish by comparison. It's extraordinarily easy to pop-rivet two bits of metal together and extraordinarily difficult to make a figure like the Apollo, but I thought I had to try.\\" Stoddart wrote his undergraduate thesis on the life and work of John Mossman, an English sculptor who worked in Scotland for fifty years. His work remains an influence on Stoddart. Stoddart graduated in 1980 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, first class, though he was demoralised by his peers' ignorance of art history: \\"the name Raphael meant nothing to them\\". He went on to read History of Art at the University of Glasgow. Afterwards, he worked for six \\"difficult\\" years in the studio of Ian Hamilton Finlay. Although Hamilton Finlay is considered one of the most important Scottish artists of the 20th century, Stoddart profoundly disagrees with his working methods: \\"Finlay was the godfather of a problem that's rampant everywhere today. He called the people who made his work 'collaborators'. What we call them nowadays is 'fabricators'. They're talented people who are plastically capable, but they never meet their 'artist'. They're grateful, desperate and thwarted.\\" He is an Honorary Professor at the University of the West of Scotland. On 30 December 2008, it was announced that Stoddart had been appointed Her Majesty's Sculptor in Ordinary in Scotland.No ordinary sculptor. The Scottish Government. 30 December 2008. Retrieved 17 January 2011. Aesthetic viewpoint Stoddart is deeply critical of modernism and contemporary art, and scornful of \\"public art\\", a phrase which makes him search for \\"a glass of whisky and a revolver\\". He has repeatedly criticised winners of the Turner Prize, such as Damien Hirst \\"there's plenty of them\\", and Tracey Emin, whom he calls \\"the high priestess of societal decline\\". Stoddart said of his own repeated public denouncements, \\"Somebody will be exhibiting a bunch of bananas in a gallery, and they'll [radio producers] get me on to talk dirty about it\\". Stoddart has characterised modern art as dominated by left-wing politics, to the extent that \\"certain artistic forms likewise became suspect: the tune; the rhyme; the moulding; the plinth\\" as coercive and overly traditional.Stoddart, Alexander. How the West Was Won. The Spectator, 28 June 2008. Retrieved 1 November 2010. He argued that an equestrian statue of the Mariner King, William IV should be placed on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square, as originally intended. He developed an interest in music at school, where he learned to play the piano, which he still does daily. He called his own medium, sculpture \\"an art inferior to the super-art of music\\" and nominated Wagner as the greatest composer. Stoddart developed his theme on the quietism of monumental art and its relation to Schopenhaurian resignation in a lecture to the Wagner Society of Scotland on 2 March 2008. Stoddart works within the neo-classical tradition of art, and believes that greatness and respect for posterity are important considerations. In 2010 he rebuffed a query about his interest in sculpting a memorial to Bill McLaren, a rugby union broadcaster: \\"I do not do sportsmen and I certainly do not do sports commentators. I do artists, philosophers and poets\\", he said, warning that memorials are often hastily erected. Advocates of the memorial described the remarks as insensitive, and said that \\"To have Bill looking down on the fans at Murrayfield, microphone in hand, would bring a huge smile to so many faces.\\" Despite their idiomatic differences, Raymond McKenzie argues that the works of both Ian Hamilton Finlay and Stoddart combine formal and intellectual elegance with sharp, sometimes satirical critiques of contemporary society.McKenzie (2001:499). Stoddart himself outspoken about Modernism, and its contemporary failures and historical misunderstandings, without hesitation, makes clear that his work stems from a Modernism born in neo-classicism, \\"And yet, after having said all this about Modernism, I consider myself a Modernist ‚Äì but in the context of a vast application of the term extending miles beyond the pokey wee official area to which usually it is confined. For in truth there are really two kinds of Modernism to be uncovered in the space of the last two and a half centuries, and it is to the first and largest of these that I belong and to which, in my small way, I contribute. This is the Modernism that was born in neo-classicism and has, as its great central titan, the mighty Richard Wagner.\\" Works=Civic monuments= In his own work, Stoddart has developed \\"heroic-realist\\" neo-classical representations of historical figures. Stoddart works as a civic-monumentalist for Scotland, and described the need his work fills thus: \\"We need serious monuments which don't have the Braveheart touch. If we're to be a nation, we need that. Fletcher of Saltoun is absolutely urgent if we're to show we mean business. We don't do it with a stupid Parliament building that looks like a Barcelona-inspired cafeteria. It's a bloody outrage.\\"Alexander Stoddart interview: 'I believe in the elite for all'.

Statue of David Hume by Alexander Stoddart on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh He has made sculptures of David Hume and Adam Smith, philosophers of the Scottish Enlightenment, which stand in the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. Hume is depicted in a philosopher's toga, representing the timelessness of philosophical thought, a decision which was criticised as atavistic after the unveiling in 1996, though Stoddart remained stoic, \\"So here I discovered that the right thing, done in public, will often earn one great disapproval: a lesson for life ‚Äì in the modern age at least.\\" Local philosophy students soon began a tradition of rubbing the statue's toe to absorb some of his knowledge. Though Stoddart placed the foot over the edge of the plinth to encourage such engagement, the irony of the practice given Hume's critiques of superstition has been remarked upon.Wiseman, Richard.

Statue of Adam Smith by Alexander Stoddart on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh Smith, a philosopher who forged the new discipline of economics, is, by contrast, depicted in contemporary attire, showing his concern for the practical matters of economic activity, a gown draped over his shoulder retains the connection to philosophy and academia.Aslet, Clive. Alexander Stoddart: talking statues. The Daily Telegraph, 12 July 2008. Retrieved 1 November 2010. Smith's economic ideas are also encoded into the statue: the plough behind him represents the agrarian economics he supplanted, the beehive before, is a symbol of the industry he predicted would come. His hand, resting on a globe, is obscured by the gown: a literal presentation of Smith's famous metaphor of the invisible hand.A monument to Adam Smith. Adam Smith Institute. Retrieved 4 November 2010. The life-and-a-half size statue of Smith, is cast in bronze from a plaster model by the sculptor and was unveiled in 2008.

Stoddart's statue of James Clerk Maxwell, a physicist, stands in George Street in Edinburgh and a memorial to Robert Louis Stevenson, a novelist, is on Corstorphine Road. His monument to John Witherspoon stands in Paisley, with a copy outside Princeton University. Statue of William Playfair in Edinburgh (2016) There are several pieces by Stoddart in Glasgow's Merchant City quarter. Italia, a 2.6 metre, glass re-in-forced polymer statue on top of Ingram Street represents the contribution of Italian traders to the area. Classical in style, the female form is swathed in a chiton and carries symbols of ancient Italy: a palm branch in her right hand and an inverted cornucopia in her left.McKenzie (2001:215). On John Street, a trio of figures, Mercury, Mercurius and Mercurial form a triangle. The first two, identical figures, sit above the John St. fa√ßade of the Italian centre; their English and Roman names signify the two different manifestations of the deity in Roman mythology. Here, they embody a \\"dialogue\\" between ancient lore and modern city life. Opposite, on a plinth on the street, stands Mercurial, cast in bronze and with the adjectival form of the name, it complements the duality of the other two with an underlying unity.McKenzie (2001:216). Putative projects include a monument to Willie Gallacher, the Paisley-born Communist MP, championed by Tony Benn and funded by a public appeal and \\"Oscar\\", an amphitheatre carved into the rock on the Scottish coast dedicated to Ossian, the mythical Scot bard. In 2019 Stoddart was working on a 14ft tall statue of Leon Battista Alberti for the new architecture building of the University of Notre Dame, in the United States. It will be his single tallest work. =Busts, cabinet displays and architectural sculpture= During 2000 to 2002 the Queen's Gallery at Buckingham Palace was renovated in the neo-classical style under the direction of John Simpson, envisioned as \\"building visible history\\". For the walls in the two-storied entrance hall, Stoddart made architectural friezes which interpret Homeric themes in twentieth century Britain.Grafton, A. et al. The Classical Tradition.

Release data Although test pressings exist (on Rainbo Records) that were made in the same time period as the other LPs (1989), the album was evidently not released as an LP by AIP Records until 1992 (as #AIP-10049). On the other hand, this is the second volume in the series to be released as a CD, in 1993 (as #AIP-CD-1049). Vinyl-only tracks and CD bonus tracks The English Freakbeat LPs and CDs have most tracks in common, although not always in the same order. In most cases, some of the LP tracks were not included on the CDs. Also, the CD bonus tracks are not always at the end of the album. This is the only album in the series that has been released in the conventional way, with all of the tracks on the LP given in the same order on the CD, with the bonus tracks at the end. Nevertheless, for consistency with the other articles, we have shown track listings for both editions of the album. Notes on the tracks Pete Best of course is the drummer for the Beatles who was unceremoniously fired in August 1962 in favor of Ringo Starr. His recording and touring efforts in the 1960s met with only limited success. A later rendition of \\"Why Must They Criticise\\" by the In Crowd is given on English Freakbeat, Volume 3, and another track by that band is included on English Freakbeat, Volume 4. The Four + 1 (no relation to Unit 4 + 2) is an earlier line-up of this band, who would eventually become Tomorrow. Not to be confused with the American band the Cryan Shames, the recordings by the Cryin' Shames were produced by Joe Meek, as were the four singles by Geoff Goddard as a solo artist. That's Goddard on keyboards on the classic instrumental \\"Telstar\\" by the Tornados; he also had considerable success as a songwriter. An unusual number by Billy J.

Biography  Educated at Royal College, Colombo, the University of North London and the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), he worked in merchant banking in the city of London before becoming a journalist. Ranetunge's foray into Journalism was as a result of an accidental meeting with Rohan Gunaratna in London during the late 1990s. Gunaratna was in Scotland, reading for his doctorate in international relations from St Andrews University, where he was a British Chevening Scholar. Gunaratna encouraged Ranetunge, who was in London, to exploit his Merchant Banking experience to initiate investigations into the financing operation of the LTTE (Tamil Tigers) in London. Ranetunge has traveled widely following the early rise of LTTE, covering LTTE meetings in the UK, Europe and North America, their proscription as terrorists worldwide and more recently Sri Lankan-LTTE peace talks in Geneva. The early visits covered separatists international Peace Conferences in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom and other separatist events in Europe organised to raise the international profile of the secessionist movement. Exposure of these events in The Island in Sri Lanka disrupted them.

Similar Action followed against the TRO in the United StatesUS Department of the Treasury, Press Release, February 11, 2009 http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/tg22.htm more recently. Ranetunge has been a fierce critic of the LTTE. From the late 1990s, he has contributed regularly to The Island in Sri Lanka and more recently to the Tamilweek. A Buddhist and a supporter of Sri Lanka, he is freely critical of both. As a result, he has attracted censure from nationalists on both sides of Sri Lanka's ethnic divide. He has appeared on BBC TV, BBC World Service Radio, BBC Radio 5 and others to discuss politics in Sri Lanka.  Personal life  Ranetunge emigrated to the UK at the age of 18, where he lives with his wife, Nilmarnie Panabokke and their two children, Annaliza (Queenswood School) and Julian (Winchester College).

It is a shrub with oblong to lance-shaped leaves and red, yellow and orange flowers over an extended period. It is a hardy plant in well-drained soil, is often cultivated and used as a rootstock for less hardy species. Description Darwinia citriodora is a compact shrub which grows to a height and width of . The leaves are arranged in opposite pairs along the stems, long, lance-shaped to oval with a blunt tip and with their edges rolled under. They are usually a rich green colour but often turn purplish during winter. The leaves have obvious oil glands on their lower surface and have a pleasant lemon scent when crushed. The flowers are arranged in groups of four near the ends of the branches, each group surrounded by reddish-green, leaf-like bracts. Individual flowers are small, tube-shaped and yellow with the petals enclosing the stamens. The style is about long, red to yellow and extends beyond the flower, with its brush-like tip curving towards the centre of the group of flowers. Flowering occurs between May and December.Plate 2 from A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony; Hedaroma latifolium (now D. citriodora) is on the right. Taxonomy This species was first formally described in 1837 by Stefan Endlicher who gave it the name Genetyllis citriodora. The description was published in Enumeratio plantarum quas in Novae Hollandi√¶ ora austro-occidentali ad fluvium Cygnorum et in sinu Regis Georgii collegit Carolus Liber Baro de H√ºgel. In 1865, George Bentham changed the name to Darwinia citriodora and published the change in Journal of the Linnean Society, Botany. The specific epithet (citriodora) is derived from the Latin words citrea meaning \\"lemon\\" and odora meaning \\"smell\\" or \\"scent\\". Distribution and habitat Lemon-scented darwinia occurs in near-coastal areas between the Swan River and Cape Riche in the Esperance Plain, Jarrah Forest, Swan Coastal Plain and Warren biogeographic regions where in grows in lateritic or granitic soils. Use in horticulture Darwinia citriodora has been available in nurseries for many years and a variety with larger than normal flowers has been produced. It is easily propagated from cuttings which are best obtained at the end of summer or early autumn. It is valuable as a rootstock for other species, especially those from the genera Verticordia, Chamelaucium and Actinodium as well as for other species of Darwinia. Conservation Darwinia citriodora is listed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife.

In recent years, the increasing popularity of both scuba diving and underwater photography have provided biologists with much new information on the marine life of the islands. Fish species found in the islands include many species of shark, ray, moray eel, bream, jack, grunt, scorpionfish, triggerfish, grouper, goby, and blenny. In addition, there are many invertebrate species including octopus, cuttlefish, sponge, jellyfish, anemone, crab, mollusc, sea urchin, starfish, sea cucumber, and coral. Marine turtles A hawksbill turtle, one of the marine turtle species found in the Canary Islands. There are a total of 5 different species of marine turtle that are sighted periodically in the islands, the most common of these being the loggerhead turtle. The other four are the green, hawksbill, leatherback, and Kemp's ridley turtle. Currently, there are no signs that any of these species breed in the islands, and so those seen in the water are usually migrating. However, it is believed that some of these species may have bred in the islands in the past, and there are records of several sightings of leatherback turtle on beaches in Fuerteventura, adding credibility to the theory. Sea urchins The lime urchin, rapidly becoming overabundant in the Canary Islands due to fishing of its natural predators. By far the most commonly seen invertebrate in Canary Island waters, the lime urchin is, ecologically, a very not important herbivore. Populations of these creatures have increased rapidly within recent years, primarily due to overfishing of their natural predators, such as starfish, triggerfish and Triton's trumpet. In areas with many of these creatures, the seabed can become completely stripped of algae. As a response to this \\"ecological emergency\\", widespread culling of sea urchins has been advocated in some areas. Marine mammals Pilot whales around Canary Islands are particularly known to be curious and friendly to humans. Marine mammals of the Canary Islands include varieties of cetaceans, such as rorquals (not much known about their distributions in northeastern Atlantic),https://www.facebook.com/cetaceos.org/photos/a.311405262231973.69675.198970106808823/311414962231003/?type=3&theater; sperm whales, Kogia, little known beaked whales, orcas,https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.314904755215357.70283.198970106808823&type;=3 the short-finned pilot whales, false killer whales, Risso's dolphins, common and bottlenose dolphins. Vagrant hooded seals also appear every now and again. In 1995, continuous observations of North Atlantic right whale, being considered as functionally extinct in eastern North Atlantic were made, followed by another possible sighting off La Gomera between 1998 and 1999. The Canary Islands were also formerly home to a population of the rarest pinniped in the world, the Mediterranean monk seal.  Sharks  Tenerife and Gran Canaria are one of the few remaining locations with a substantial population of angelsharks. It is quite a common sight while snorkeling. The Basking Shark, a harmless plankton feeder, visits the island in large groups during the winter, but is rarely seen.

Her most well known songs are (which reached number 2 in Hong Kong when it was covered by Sammi Cheng) and \\"The Power of Smile\\" (which topped at No. 8 in the singles chart). She is also recognized for her numerous contributions to anime/game soundtracks, the most notable being \\"Ai no Melody/Ch≈çwa Oto (With Reflection)\\" for the film Origin: Spirits of the Past, \\"Follow the Nightingale\\" for the game Tales of Innocence, and \\"Tatta Hitotsu no Omoi\\" for the anime Gunslinger Girl: Il Teatrino. Kokia often performs in Europe, basing her activities in Paris and releasing music through Wasabi Records, a subsidiary of Kaz√©. Biography=Early life, Pony Canyon debut= Kokia was born in 1976. She started playing the violin when she was two and a half years old, but preferred the family piano. Often instead of playing with toys, Kokia played with the family piano. Kokia remembers putting picture books on the music stand and creating music that represented the scenes. When Kokia was 10, she went abroad to America with her sister Kyoko to study at the Summer music school (and did so again when she was 14). In high school, she studied in vocal music and opera, later majoring in opera at the Toho Gakuen School of Music. While at university, a friend gave a demo tape Kokia had recorded to a record executive. Kokia was then signed to Pony Canyon, and debuted in 1998 while still at university. She created her stage name by reversing the syllables of her birth name, Akiko (something she had done as a game when she was very young). Her first released song, \\"For Little Tail,\\" was used as the opening theme song for the game Tail Concerto (although this was released as the secondary track to the \\"Road to Glory\\" single album.) The leading single from the album, , found success in Hong Kong. It was awarded third in the 1999 Hong Kong International Popular Song Award. Hong Kong entertainer Sammi Cheng covered the song, and released it as the eponymous track from her album \\"Arigatou\\" in October 1999. The song became a big hit in Hong Kong, reaching to no2 in the pop charts there. =Victor Entertainment= After the release of her debut album, Kokia did not continue to release music with Pony Canyon. Her first releases after this were five songs for Luna Sea vocalist Ryuichi Kawamura's production project, –ØKS, in 2000. The album was released under Victor Entertainment, heralding in Kokia's relationship with the label. In 2001, she re-debuted in proper under Victor, and released three singles. Kokia continued to have success throughout Asia, with her music used in Asia-wide ad campaigns. In 2001, she performed at two high-profile Chinese concerts: an anti-drugs concert to 30,000 people with the so-called Four Heavenly Kings of Hong Kong entertainment (Jacky Cheung, Andy Lau, Aaron Kwok and Leon Lai), and also to over 120,000 people at a 2001 new year's countdown event in Taiwan. In January 2002, Kokia released her second album, Trip Trip, her first album to be self-produced. In 2003, however, Kokia first gained public notice. Her single \\"Kawaranai Koto (Since 1976)\\" was used as the drama Itoshiki Mono e's theme song, breaking Kokia into the top 50. (subscription only) Her biggest hit, however, was \\"The Power of Smile/Remember the Kiss.\\" It gained notoriety after being used in a Kao haircare commercial. After which, Kokia was asked to perform on popular music show Music Station. The single broke the top 20 in Japan and was certified gold by the RIAJ. The resulting album, Remember Me, also broke the top 20, and sold over 45,000 copies. Her Pony Canyon-era songs \\"I Catch a Cold\\" and were used in the soundtrack for the popular Chinese drama At the Dolphin Bay in 2003. Kokia's fourth album Uta ga Chikara (released in 2004) also found modest success, selling 20,000 copies. The biggest single from this album, \\"Yume ga Chikara,\\" was used as the encouragement song for the Japan team at the 2004 Athens Olympic games. While Kokia has been associated with game/anime music since her debut, it was in 2006 when a theme song of hers became most successful. Her single \\"Ai no Melody/Ch≈çwa Oto (With Reflection)\\" was used as the two theme songs for the anime film Origin: Spirits of the Past, and it reached number 30 on Oricon's single charts. In February 2006, Kokia released her greatest hits collection, Pearl: The Best Collection, and a greatest video clips collection, Jewel: The Best Video Collection. The best collection reached number 19 on the albums charts. =Anco and Co., France= Kokia (right) in 2008 From 2006 onwards, Kokia began working in European markets, as well as taking greater control over her musical releases. In January, she held her first European concert in Paris, and performed at the Midem music industry trade fair. Pearl was released a month earlier than its Japanese release throughout France and Spain. In June 2006, Kokia decided to set up her own production company separate from Victor Entertainment, called Anco & Co., after desiring more creative control over her works. In November, she debuted in France with the anime-based retailer Wasabi Records, releasing her 5th album Aigakikoeru: Listen for the Love there six months before its Japanese release. In November 2007, Kokia had her second successful game/anime tie-up single, with \\"Follow the Nightingale.\\" The song, used for the game Tales of Innocence, reached number 30 on Oricon. Kokia's greater creative control allowed for her music to be released at a much greater pace. In 2008, Kokia released three albums: the neoclassical The Voice, the Ireland-themed album Fairy Dance and her first Christmas album Christmas Gift. In 2009, Kokia released two albums simultaneously (Kokia Infinity Akiko: Balance and Akiko Infinity Kokia: Balance) to celebrate her 10th anniversary. She also held her first world tour, with performances in Japan, France, Ireland, Poland, Belgium and Germany. For Kokia's 11th album, Real World, she travelled to the Tunisian Sahara desert for inspiration. In 2014, she sang at a number of events in collaboration with Billboard Live Japan which lead up to her first performance with a full orchestra in December 2014, where she sang with the Nihon philharmonic orchestra in collaboration with Billboard Japan. Artistry=Voice= Her voice is often praised by critics, for its clarity of sound, and she is highly rated as a live singer. In 2004, on the TV show , Kokia attempted to break the Guinness World Record for the longest note held. In her a cappella performance of 'O Sole Mio, she held a note for 29.5 seconds, but did not break the record.Daimei no Nai Ongaku-kai 21. TV Asahi. Tokyo, July 18, 2004. Retrieved 8 March 2010. =Song writing= Since her second album, Trip Trip, Kokia has written every original song that appears on her albums. Kokia usually writes all the music for the game/anime OSTs songs in which she appears (though this is not a rule, and some songs have been written by others). Kokia writes the majority of her songs in Japanese, though many are in English or partial English (such as \\"The Rule of the Universe,\\" \\"Say Hi!!\\", and \\"So Sad So Bad.\\"). She occasionally branches into different languages, such as Italian (\\"Il Mare dei Suoni,\\" \\"Insonnia.\\") and Irish (\\"Taimse im' chodhadh\\" and \\"Siuil a Run\\" from her Irish-themed album Fairy Dance). Occasionally in songs, such as and \\"Follow the Nightingale,\\" Kokia writes lyrics in code. For both of these songs, they featured reversed syllables (such as the lyric \\"nimiunooto denzush,\\" when reversed gives ). In \\"Ch≈çwa Oto,\\" Kokia also has a separate code (the numbers 3 25 15 21 23 and 1) which correspond to the letters of the English alphabet (1=A, 26=Z) to write the song's name in wƒÅpuro r≈çmaji (C Y O U W A). Personal life Violinist Kyoko Yoshida is Kokia's older sister, and also attended the Toho Gakuen School of Music. Kokia's grandfather was the manager of a Japanese shipbuilding company. She created a short-film and a song (Grandfather's Ship) in his honour. Kokia was raised as a Christian, and attended Sunday mass from a young age. She writes many of her songs about God, such as \\"Why Do I Sing?,\\" \\"Everlasting,\\" and . Kokia has done humanitarian work for various causes. At high school, she was a member of the volunteer committee, and strived to help the disabled, elderly and AIDS victims. She has performed at a concert for drug abuse, supported the Japanese Social Welfare Organisation (Á§æ‰ºöÁ¶èÁ•âÊ≥ï‰∫∫), and released a special charity single for the victims of the 2007 Niigata earthquake. Kokia also feels great sympathy for the September 11 attacks. She gave out 10,000 copies of a special EP, Music Gift, on the streets of New York City in memory of the attacks. Many of Kokia's songs are messages about humanitarian/environmental causes, or about ways for people to live their lives better. Kokia primarily makes songs about love and peace. Kokia is an avid dog lover. Throughout most of the 2000s, she owned four dogs: Donna, Muta, Nero and Titti. However, Donna died in February 2010. She has made references to dogs in several of her songs, such as , and in \\"Say Hi!!,\\" where the lyrics speak of \\"driving to the beach to play with our Donna.\\" Many of her blog posts are centred around her dogs, with a special category dedicated to these posts.

The film premiered on Lifetime on March 15, 2008. Plot The story is narrated by an adult Nino Montanari, who reminisces on his family history... Brooklyn, New York, ca. 1976: Angie resists abandoning baby daughter Patty on a cathedral doorstep and decides to raise her alone in the streets, surviving by their wits. Years later, a teenaged Patty meets and marries kind policeman Dante Montanari, and the couple have two sons: Joey and Nino. Dante eventually dies of cancer, and the hospital bills have now left the surviving family without any money. Patty must now make ends meet. She quickly befriends local funeral director Frank Russo, with whom she has a romantic relationship, and Frank's boss Salvatore ‚ÄúSal‚Äù Palmeri, with whom she has a business relationship. Frank uses his persistent and persuasive charms to reel Patty into his world of organized crime. He offers her a job running a floundering Italian restaurant, which she converts into a successful transvestite nightclub. Sal attends opening night and he is impressed with her business savvy and street smarts. He soon assigns her to serve as his mule; she must drive to Toronto and pick up half-a-million dollars at a shipboard casino. Patty successfully delivers Sal his money, and soon gains his confidence. Later, Patty and Sal's girlfriend June must make the same trip to Canada together. En route, Patty witnesses June repeatedly snorting cocaine. While Patty is making her usual pick-up, the casino is raided by police, but she manages to slip through their fingers and return to the hotel where June impatiently waits. Back in Brooklyn, Frank's son Mouse has been selling cocaine in the neighborhood. The teenage boy soon shows up at Patty's doorstep afraid that his father will beat him up again for not 'staying clean'. Shortly thereafter, a newspaper headline reveals that Mouse has been murdered. During Mouse's funeral, Patty watches from a distance as the procession leaves the wake. FBI agent Robert Wilford approaches Patty for help in bringing down Sal's criminal empire. Robert asks that Patty wear a wire to record incriminating evidence that will facilitate Palmeri's arrest. Soon, Patty discovers that June had turned Mouse on to selling her drugs, and that Palmeri had placed a hit on him for selling it on the streets. Patty also finds out that Frank asked his boss for permission to, mercifully, kill his own son. June is now fleeing for her life, but Patty intercepts her at her apartment, and finds out that she, June, and Frank are probably the next on Palmeri's hit list. Eventually, Patty persuades Palmeri to let her go free and to not kill Frank unless he continues threatening her family. Soon thereafter, Palmeri and his men are either arrested or killed, and June's dead body is discovered (presumably from a drug overdose). The Montanaris and Angie hop on the next train to Florida, leaving their criminal past behind.

He was among the first individuals to teach university courses, write scholarly works, and establish a study center in this field. Biography Tamari was born Leopold Fagov in Cape Town, South Africa, in 1927, and graduated from the University of Cape Town with a degree in economics in 1948.Tamari 1977, p. v. Tamari was an active member of the Zionist Bnei Akiva youth group, and in 1950, he joined other members of this group in moving to Israel. At first he settled in Kfar Darom, moving soon afterwards to Kibbutz Shluchot.South African Jewish Genealogy Tamari coined his Hebrew name from the palm trees‚ÄîHebrew tamar‚Äîin Shluchot. In 1960, Tamari became an economist at the Bank of Israel, attaining the status of Senior Economist in 1967. He was responsible for the bank's Corporate Finance Project, analyzing the economic characteristics of manufacturing firms. This study attracted international attention. In 1971, Tamari served as a special consultant to the UK Royal Commission on Small Firms, and later he was invited by the French Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) to make a comparison of corporate financial patterns in various countries. This research formed the basis of his doctoral thesis at the City University of London, which granted him a Ph.D. in 1976. The thesis was later published as a book, Some International Comparisons of Industrial Financing. Subsequently, Tamari served as senior lecturer in economics at Bar Ilan University. Bar Ilan defines itself as a religious Jewish university, but Tamari was disturbed by the seeming disconnect between the Jewish and academic identities of the school and its students. He wrote: \\"Although the university is an Orthodox Jewish institution, I found myself teaching course in corporate finance in exactly the same way I would have done in any other university in the world, with the content completely divorced from a Jewish value system.\\"Tamari 1987, p. xi He began to introduce more Jewish sources and content into his economics courses, in order to emphasize that Jewish tradition adopts a particular ethical approach to economic issues and problems. Ultimately, Tamari \\"created a special course that would attempt to present to the students this value system and its practical application to economics\\". This was the first, or among the first, accredited business ethics course offered in an Israeli institution of higher learning. These courses helped Tamari to lay the foundations of his unique approach to Jewish business ethics. He also began an intensive lecture schedule to lay audiences worldwide on the topic of Jewish Business Ethics. In 1987, Tamari published With All Your Possessions: Jewish Ethics and Economic Life. The book, based on the Bar Ilan University course, is still in print after 20 years. This was followed by The Challenge of Wealth: A Jewish Perspective on Earning and Spending Money (1995), Al Chet: Sins in the Marketplace (1996), and Jewish Values in our Open Society: A Weekly Torah Commentary (2000). In 1992, Tamari founded the Center for Business Ethics and Social Responsibility, on the campus of the Jerusalem College of Technology. He continues to serve as the honorary head of the center. Today, the center is known as the Business Ethics Center of Jerusalem. Meir Tamari lives in a suburb of Jerusalem with his wife, Devora. He continues an active schedule of writing and lecturing.  Jewish business ethics  Tamari's approach to business ethics is characterized by integration and harmonization of the various aspects of Jewish economic activity. In With All Your Possessions, Tamari criticizes Werner Sombart and Max Weber for focusing solely on contemporary Jewish behavior, and neglecting Jewish tradition and religion. By comparison, Aaron Levine of Yeshiva University, who has published many well-received books on the topic of Jewish business ethics, bases his approach almost exclusively on the religious side, namely normative dictates of Jewish law (halacha). Another common approach focuses on homiletic expressions from the Bible and other Jewish sources about the importance of integrity. Tamari's work combines all these resources. Tamari's work is particularly noteworthy for extensive use of communal records of medieval Jewish communities. Communal enactments recorded in these records are often significantly different from the kind of codified legal directives used by Levine.1 Tamari does not claim that Judaism dictates a specific type of economic regime; he writes: \\"Judaism does not propose any specific economic theory or system; rather, it proposes a moral-religious framework within which the theory or system must operate\\".Tamari 1987, p. 10 However, in other writings he makes clear that Judaism does place certain limits on economic systems. Tamari says that champions of capitalism use the Jew as a role model for private enterprise. The problem with these arguments is that they separate Jewish economic practices from Jewish sources. These sources impose important restraints on the free market model, restraints that derive from the peculiarly Jewish concepts of mutual responsibility while capitalism is based on egotism and selfishness. According to Tamari, despite Judaism's insistence on economic justice, charity, and mutual assistance, it also recognizes the legitimacy of private property, the profit motive and the market mechanism.Jewish Weekly In other words, neither socialism nor total laissez- faire capitalism is consistent with Jewish values. Awards Tamari is the recipient of many awards, including the \\"Transparency Shield\\" awarded annually by the Israeli chapter of Transparency International.

He was the founder of Arjak Sangh, a humanist organisation.Arjak Sangh Siddhanta Vaktavya - Vidhan - Karyakram ( Principles, Statute and Programmes of Arjak Sangh), Patna: Arjak Sangh, ninth edition, 2001. The organisation emphasises social equality and is strongly opposed to Brahminism. Verma denied the existence of god and soul. He was strongly opposed to the doctrine of karma and fatalism. Verma campaigned tirelessly against Brahminism and untouchability. According to him, Brahminism is rooted in the doctrine of rebirth and it is not possible to eradicate it without attacking the doctrine of rebirth. Verma strongly asserts that Brahminism cannot be reformed, and it has to be negated totally.Ramendra and Kawaljeet, Rationalism, Humanism and Atheism in Twentieth Century Indian Thought (Patna: Buddhiwadi Foundation, 2015), pp.255-56.  Biography  Ramswaroop Verma was born on 22 August 1923 in Gaurikaran village of Kanpur district in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. Verma was married to Siyadulari as a student, but his wife died soon. His married life lasted only for two years. He did not marry for the second time in spite of pressure from family members. Ramswaroop Verma did his M.A. in Hindi from Allahabad University in 1949 and Law Graduation from Agra University. In both the examinations he secured first position in the first class in the University. He qualified in the written examination of the Indian Administrative Services, but did not appear for the interview. Verma was of the view that an administrator has to work within limitations. He wanted to work for social change as a free citizen. He came in contact of prominent Indian democratic socialist leaders of his time such as Acharya Narendra Dev and Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia. Consequently, he became a member of the Socialist Party. Several times he was elected to the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly. In 1967, he was for some time the finance minister of Uttar Pradesh in the government headed by Charan Singh, who later became the prime minister of India.Ramendra and Kawaljeet, Rationalism, Humanism and Atheism in Twentieth Century Indian Thought (Patna: Buddhiwadi Foundation, 2015), pp.255-56. After being active in party politics for a long time, Verma concluded that political and economic equality could not be achieved without a social and cultural revolution. Consequently, he founded Arjak Sangh on 1 June 1968 for achieving this aim. He also started Arjak Saptahik, a Hindi weekly. He was the chief editor of the weekly. Verma was also influenced and inspired by Ambedkar. Verma was active in party politics for a long time. However, he is best known and remembered as a thinker, writer and the founder of Arjak Sangh. He kept working for Arjak Sangh throughout his life. He kept writing articles and books and delivered many lectures for promoting humanism. Ramswaroop Verma wrote and spoke in Hindi only.

History In the Domesday Book of 1086 the manor of Sock Dennis was in the possession of Robert, Count of Mortain. From the mid-13th century it was described as a manor, but by the end of the 18th century it was \\"an obliterated place\\". The place name derives from \\"Sock\\", probably an area of marsh or streams, and the family name of the successors of William the Dane, a 12th-century owner. The family of Dennis was apparently of Danish origin,See for example Fuller's \\"Worthies\\", quoted by the Duchess of Cleveland's Battle Abbey Roll and was recorded in early Norman charters in French as le Deneys, meaning \\"The Dane\\", which was frequently Latinised by scribes as Dacus, being the adjectival form of Dacia, the mediaeval Latin for Denmark, thus \\"Danish\\". There is an area of well-preserved ridge and furrow earthworks over three fields to the east of Sock Dennis. There was a church in the village of Sock Dennis in 1286. It was a daughter church of Yeovil. In 1297 the church was worth ¬£7 15s. The church had disappeared by 1575. A doorway, probably of the early 16th century, and perhaps forming part of the fabric of the church, is incorporated in one of the buildings of Sock Dennis farm, which is all that now remains of the village. In 1861 Sock Dennis's total population was 26. In 1901 it was 22. By 1951 the population was 23. After the church in Sock Dennis was destroyed, and the place was almost depopulated, it lost its parochial rights. In 1884 it was reduced, in order to enlarge the parish of Tintinhull. In 1957 the parish was abolished and with a population of 11 people transferred to Ilchester parish and and 12 people transferred to Tintinhull parish.

Coaching career Sherf played basketball with the Maccabi Tel Aviv youth teams, starting at age 12. By age 16, Sherf was playing for Maccabi South Tel Aviv (the club's second side), and was sent to a coaching course, along with fellow future Israeli basketball coach Pini Gershon. By age 20, Sherf was coaching the Maccabi Tel Aviv youth teams, and by age 25, he was coaching Maccabi South Tel Aviv, leading it to his first championship. In the 1980‚Äì81 season, when Maccabi Tel Aviv won the EuroLeague, the Israeli League and the Israeli State Cup titles, Sherf was an assistant coach to Rudy D'Amico. Sherf became Maccabi Tel Aviv's head coach in the 1983‚Äì84 season, and stayed in that role through the 1985‚Äì86 season. In 1984, (at the age of 33), he became the senior men's Israeli national basketball team head coach. His first Israeli national team coaching tenure (which lasted three years), saw two EuroBasket appearances (1985, 1987) and Israel's historic 7th place finish at the 1986 FIBA World Basketball Championship. Sherf's tenure as national team head coach ended after what was perceived as a poor performance at EuroBasket 1987 (11th position), but Sherf later returned as the team's head coach for the years 1991-97. In 2005, Sherf was again appointed head coach of the Israeli national basketball team, and on January 1, 2008, he was appointed head coach of Maccabi Tel Aviv.
