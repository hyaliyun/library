Upon graduating from Kuwait University in 1987 with a BA. degree in English language and Literature, she pursued careers in journalism, teaching, and translation before she eventually started to write professionally as a published author. She is a member of both the Jordanian Writers Association and the Arab Writers Federation.  Personal life  Habayeb was born on June 4, 1965, in Kuwait, where she also grew up and studied. She obtained her B.A. in English Language and Literature from Kuwait University in 1987. Forced by the Gulf War that erupted a few years after her graduation, Habayeb—along with her family members—moved to Jordan and settled there for years before she relocated to the United Arab Emirates, where she currently lives.  Employment  Before writing became an actual profession of hers, Habayeb had worked in different fields. She first worked in journalism in Kuwait and worked as a teacher and translator after moving to Jordan. But even after achieving recognition as an eminent writer, she opted to remain existent within the domains of journalism and translation. She has translated several English books into Arabic.  Writing career  Habayeb's writings are majorly fiction, although she also writes non-fiction. The three main literary genres her bibliography includes are poetry, short stories, and novels. = Poetry = Although Habayeb is known to be a prose writer, her early beginnings were with poetry—particularly, free verse. In May 1990, a collection of fourteen free- verse poems by Habayeb—under the title \\"Images\\"—were published in the 23rd issue of An-Naqid magazine, a London-based magazine that has closed down. The most notable poetry work by Habayeb is a poetry collection called \\"Begging,\\" published in 2009 by the Arab Institute for Research and Publishing [AIRP], which is the publishing house that has published most of her works. The collection has received rave reviews from critics. Al Ghad newspaper, in an article published on October 14, 2009, commended Habayeb's new release and concluded by saying \\"through this different written work of hers, Huzama Habayeb is not seeking to announce another aspect of her creative experience, by marching towards poetry after writing shorty stories and novels and excelling at both realms; she's rather seeking to vigorously breathe out the obsessions of the nearby woman within her depths, who is desirous of breeding glowing words, for writing here is an act of salvation that is concerned with not only the aesthetic aspect, but also every other formidable and different aspect.\\" The following is a translation of an excerpt from \\"Begging\\" collection: = Short stories = The cover of Habayeb's third short story collection, \\"A Form of Absence\\" The most literary form that has immensely contributed to Habayeb's regional fame is the short story, which culminated in 1992 when she received her first writing award: Jerusalem Festival of Youth Innovation in Short Stories for her debut short-story collection, \\"The Man Who Recurs\\" (الرَّجُل الذي يَتَكرَّر) published by AIRP. Two years later—after the publication of her second short-story collection, \\"The Faraway Apples\\" (التُفَّاحات البَعيدَة) in 1994 by Al-Karmel Publishing House—the Jordanian Writers Association awarded Habayeb with her second short-story prize, Mahmoud Seif Eddin ِAl-Erani Award. In 1997, published by AIRP, Habayeb put out her third short-story collection: \\"A Form of Absence\\" (شَكْلٌ للغِياب,) which was \\"a turning point\\" in Habayeb's \\"writing technique,\\" as she personally said on a cultural TV show aired on Al Jazeera on May 4, 2004. She explained that all the women characters in the different stories could actually be the same person; all of those personas felt as if they \\"belonged to one woman,\\" which is why \\"many critics saw within this collection a nucleus or a seed for a novel.\\" \\"Sweeter Night\\" (لَيْلٌ أحْلَى,) which was released in 2002—and also by AIRP—was the fourth and last short-story collection Habayeb had gotten published before she made the transition into novel. The collection resulted in more positive feedback from critics. A review that was published on February 1, 2002, in Al-Hayat, the London-based newspaper, praised the collection saying \\"it excavates the same spots her stories usually tackle, but the digging in this new collection is deeper, farther, richer and bolder than it has ever been before. Furthermore, the stories here—in terms of narrative and linguistic technicalities—are more fermented and possessive of vision and tools simultaneously.\\" = Novels = After four successful short-story collections, Habayeb wrote her first novel, \\"The Origin of Love\\" (أصْل الهَوَى,) which was published by AIRP in 2007. The novel provoked a storm of controversy due to the abounding, brazen, sexual content in it; which is presented via both intimation and explicitness. That content caused the novel to be banned in Jordan, where it was printed, upon a directive made by the Department of Press and Publications. On a program broadcast by the Norwegian TV channel NRK2, Habayeb addressed the explicitly sexual and erotic language she occasionally resorts to in her writing emphasizing that \\"we have to put it the way it is.\\" When asked in an interview with Al Ghad newspaper on November 28, 2008, about her opinion on the ban decision, Habayeb said that \\"the media rhetoric flaunts the support of public liberties—and atop them the freedom of speech and writing—but the reality says there's an utter lack of intellectual tolerance; and determination to impose a siege on intellect, limit liberties, confiscate pens, and fabricate taboos on lame pretexts, stemming from a fact that entails imposing a culture of fear and subjection to the system and the official cultural institution.\\" She also noted that \\"the 'pornography' reason is not the real reason behind the ban decision; and the Department of Press and Publications hasn't provided me yet with a direct, candid reason.\\" As for the critical reactions on \\"The Origin of Love\\" (أصْلُ الهَوَى,) they've been highly positive. The Palestinian novelist and literary critic, Waleed Abu Bakr, wrote a critical article about the novel in August 2007, in which he described it as \\"a serious, significant novel in terms of narration techniques or the importance of the issues and crucial themes it tackles.\\" He also added that \\"all the well-structured, plentiful sex scenes do not merely aim to arouse—which is something the reader can feel without any suspicion due to the absence of eroticism in its cliched, tacky form—but to achieve gender equality.\\" And in its article on February 14, 2007, Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper said \\"Huzama Habyeb has written a political novel without writing a single letter in politics; and that's whence the beauty of this text emanates; the text that is drowned in the body's temptations and the details of the everyday life of the men whose external features haven't been described by the author.\\" The article ends by praising Habayeb's linguistic methodology: \\"One must note the fastidious language, the intelligent allegories and lexicon that demonstrate a rich dictionary, in which the popular Palestinian vocabulary stands out, gaining an eloquent impact derived from its fluency in conveying the meaning to the reader.\\" Four years after her debut novel, Habayeb's second novel \\"Before the Queen Falls Asleep\\" (قَبْلَ أن تَنامَ المَلِكَة) got published. The novel, along with the critical acclaim and being deemed \\"a quantum leap\\" in her writing, has achieved popular success according to Goodreads.com. On a TV show that was aired on Sharjah TV channel on October 5, 2013, Huzama Habayeb stated that \\"this novel—within the narrative, tale- telling frame; and without any categorization or any regard to the interpretative or critical perusal— is a story of a woman who's telling her story to her daughter who's about to study abroad.\\" The cover of Habayeb's second novel \\"Before the Queen Falls Asleep\\" Sabry Hafez, a renowned Egyptian writer and critic, described \\"Before the Queen Falls Asleep\\" (قَبْلَ أن تَنامَ المَلِكَة) as \\"a truly important novel, perhaps the most important, Palestinian novel by the second generation of Palestine's writers after the major Palestinian novels by Ghassan Kanafani, Emile Habibi, and Jabra Ibrahim Jabra. It's a novel that digs deep within the humane, Palestinian depth; and offers a narrative of the sins committed by the dishonest; Arabian reality against Palestinians—sins that degrade the humanity of that reality, and heighten the fortitude of Palestinians and the nobility of their stance. And since that she's an author of a generation that wasn't born in Palestine, her writing for Palestine acquires exacerbated significance that emphasizes the Palestinian right and its entrenchment within the cognizance and conscience. It's a novel that writes down the Palestinian woman like she has never been written before in such an efficacious and profound manner, and without any emotionalism.\\" This novel, which addresses the Palestinian perturbation, is \\"the most daring Palestinian novel ever written by a woman who defyingly, candidly, stubbornly and straightforwardly describes what inflicts the woman during the hardship of displacement,\\" according to the Palestine-based newspaper, Assafir. The novel was also among The Guardian's \\"Books of the Year 2012\\" list, as chosen by Ahdaf Soueif. The critic Mohammed Baradah, in an article in Al Hayat newspaper, commended Habayeb's \\"attractive, artistic form; multilevel language; flowing ability of describing; and cynical humor.\\" Waleed Abu Bakr described it as a novel of \\"surplus motherhood.\\" He concluded that \\" the author is possessed with the notion of loss—which dominates the atmosphere of this novel—and she represents the motive for the expectations within; and so she approaches what she has been seeking since a long time ago; and she has struggled to write about life as she has struggled to live it; and in both cases she deserves respect.\\" In \\"Before the Queen Falls Asleep\\" (قَبْلَ أنْ تَنامَ المَلِكَة,) according to Al Ghad newspaper, \\"Habayeb draws thorny and suspenseful pages that are preoccupied with pain and stumble over the concept of loss for a woman who's attempting to question love, approach life within the minimum level of personal and general defeat, clarify the meaning that is devoid of metaphor of existence, and beg the homeland; as a charming idea through telling her story to her daughter. The queen in this story is the mother; and it's also the daughter, as each one gives the other a possible—or even probable—reason to live.\\" The following is the English translation of an excerpt taken from \\"Before the Queen Falls Asleep\\" (قَبْلَ أنْ تَنامَ المَلِكَة): In January 2016, and through AIRP, Huzama Habayeb got her third novel published. The novel, which is titled \\"Velvet\\" (مُخْمَل), illustrates the intriguing realm of Palestinian camps in an unapologetic, profound, brutally honest way. It depicts the Palestinian camp in its raw form and exposes its never-before revealed verities, devoid of any embellishments or masking by the prioritized Palestinian cause. It addresses the \\"social, economic, and even cultural\\" woes and concerns devoid of ethical theorization, shunning spurious ideals and clichéd principles. It won the 2017 Naguib Mahfouz Medal for Literature. \\"Velvet\\" (مُخْمَل) displays a rare paradigm of the true woman, through the main character whose name is \\"Hawwa\\" (the equivalent of \\"Eve\\" in English language,) as Habayeb utilizes that emotionally monumental persona to encapsulate the life within Palestinian camps; projecting various niceties, sensations, and feelings. It is a story of a prodigious woman who struggles to survive and love, revives herself every time she gets shattered, and fulfills her desires through perseverance despite the unmerciful society that relentlessly crushes her. This novel is a place where love, dejection, transgression and embrace converge; developing a scene of egregious realism via a lavish narrative that embodies enchanting and shocking moments and real people, of flesh and blood, with idiosyncratic feelings Habayeb unhesitatingly uncovers. The following is the English translation of an excerpt taken from \\"Velvet\\" (مُخْمَل): = Nonfiction = Throughout her life, Habayeb has written for several daily and periodical newspapers and magazines such as Al Ra'i, Ad-Dustour, Doha Magazine, Al-Qafilah Magazine, and Dubai Al-Thakafiya, a monthly magazine in which she has her own column at present. Habayeb addresses several topics in her nonfictional pieces—politics, literature, social issues, art, anthropology and personal experiences.  International presence  Huzama Habayeb during \\"Viewing Palestine\\" event in Oslo. Despite being an Arab author whose entire published fiction is written in Arabic, Habayeb has managed to develop an international reputation through participating in multiple cultural events that took place outside the Arab World, and having some of her pieces translated into English. In September 2011, Habayeb participated in \\"Viewing Palestine;\\" a cultural, literary event about Palestinian literature held in Oslo. The event included seminars of talks and readings with several Palestinian authors, among whom was Habayeb. She also partook in a cultural event hosted by Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in April 2012, in which she—along with two other writers—gave a lecture about the discrimination to which Palestinians in Arab states are subject. Some of Habayeb's stories have been translated into English, which has helped the echo of her literary voice reach more readers worldwide. The London-based magazine Banipal has published several pieces by Habayeb translated into English such as the short story \\"Sweeter Night\\" (لَيلٌ أحْلَى) from the collection with the same name, and the twelfth chapter of the novel \\"Before the Queen Falls Asleep\\" (قَبْلَ أنْ تَنَامَ المَلِكَة). She was also one of the contributors in \\"Qissat,\\" an anthology of short stories written by Palestinian women writers that was published in 2006. Habayeb's story was \\"Thread Snaps\\" (خَيْطٌ يَنْقَطِع) off her fourth short-story collection, \\"Sweeter Night\\" (لَيْلٌ أحْلَى).  Political influence  The cover of the Arabic version of \\"The Wandering Who\\" In almost every body of work by Huzama Habayeb, whether it's a novel or short story, there is sheer adherence to her Palestinian identity; and that is strikingly evident in her first two novels and a slew of stories from her four collections. She also demonstrates that through her translations, as she tends to choose books whose content reflects the Palestinian crisis and the unjust policies exercised by Israel and affect Palestinians, such as The Wandering Who? by Gilad Atzmon, which she translated into Arabic and was published in this form in June 2013. Habayeb's most prominent milestone in terms of defying Zionism, however, is a campaign she launched against the publication of an anthology of short stories by Middle Eastern women because of the inclusion of stories by Israeli authors. Habayeb had initially accepted to contribute to the anthology, but she withdrew her piece after learning that contributions by two Israeli authors were included in the anthology; and then she contacted all the other Arab authors and persuaded them to follow her lead. The campaign was successful, as most of the authors withdrew their manuscripts, forcing the University of Texas at Austin—the institution that was adopting the project—to cancel the anthology. Habayeb justified her actions in an editorial that was published in Gulf News on May 25, 2012, saying \\"I cannot accept, ethically and morally, that my voice be shared equally with writers who reflect the voice of an obnoxious occupier.\\" Habayeb's stance, relentless efforts, and courageous stand were applauded by many in the Arab world; and she received a lot of support and praise from various Arabic media outlets.

In June 2014 he moved to the EPFL as a Professor of Physical Chemistry, where he is currently director of the Laboratoire de résonance magnétique of the ISIC (Institute of chemical sciences and engineering). In 2015 he received the Bourke award \\"for the development of experimental methods that have transformed the field of solid-state NMR and enabled new applications across chemistry\\". Research Emsley's main research field is solid-state NMR spectroscopy, specifically the development of new spectroscopic methods for the determination the atomic- level structure, the dynamics and the reactivity of a wide range of materials and molecular systems, that have been inaccessible with other analytical methods. He published articles in NMR crystallography, structural biology, protein dynamics, dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) enhanced surface NMR spectroscopy and MRI. His work has involved several collaborations with the Bruker Corporation. In 2010, under his supervision as Scientific Director, the CRMN acquired and began using the world's most powerful currently operating NMR spectrometer, which breaks the billion-hertz barrier. CRMN was also one of the first laboratories in the world to install a high field (800 MHz proton resonant frequency) solid state DNP accessory and to test the new very fast 0.7 mm MAS rotors. =Solid-state NMR sequences= Emsley worked with colleague Anne Lesage to introduce new through-bond carbon-proton correlation techniques in CP-MAS NMR, namely the MAS-J-HSQC and MAS-J-HMQC experiments, both used to improve resolution of two-dimensional heteronuclear correlation spectra through bond homonuclear correlations with the refocused INADEQUATE experiment in solids. They showed also the feasibility of ssNMR spectral editing techniques making use of heteronuclear scalar couplings. These implementations paved the way to the spectral characterization of solid samples at natural isotopic abundance, in a manner similar to liquid-state NMR. It was therefore possible use scalar couplings to probe weak bonding interactions in solids and provide the first ever direct detection of a hydrogen bond in the solid-state, as well as the first experimental demonstration of the presence of agostic interactions in surface species, indicated by carbenic J_{C-H}. His team also introduced a theoretical framework for the application of continuously phase modulated radio-frequency pulses for homonuclear decoupling in solid-state NMR, allowing new families of decoupling sequences. This allowed them to obtain high-resolution proton spectra in solids. a key step for three-dimensional structure determination of organic and inorganic materials at natural isotopic abundance. =NMR Crystallography= The improvements in the area of proton ssNMR, specifically homonuclear decoupling, set the field for the development of NMR Crystallography. Contrary to X-ray, single crystals are not necessary with ssNMR and structural information can be obtained from high-resolution spectra of disordered solids. In 2009 Emsley's group showed the possibility of total structure determination of drug-sized organic molecules through the combination of density functional theory and solid-state NMR. =Surface catalysis= Emsley and co-workers have shown that multi-dimensional solid state NMR can be exploited to chemically and structurally characterize catalytic surface species at a molecular level, such as reaction intermediates and catalytic centres of heterogeneous catalysts. =DNP-enhanced surface NMR spectroscopy= In the field of surface chemistry, Emsley and co-workers introduced a new approach in the characterization of surfaces through ssNMR, called Surface Enhanced NMR Spectroscopy (SENS). Some systems on various support materials of great chemical interest are below the sensitivity limit of detection for the technique, but such low detection limit can be boosted using DNP, coupled with isotopic labeling and high magnetic fields. This approach enhances surface NMR signals allowing the analysis of near-surface species or materials with surface areas three orders of magnitude lower than before (around 1 m2/g, instead of 1000 m2/g). Through DNP, transfer of polarization and relevant signal enhancement can occur from the protons of the solvent batch to the rarer nuclei at natural isotopic abundance on the surface framework, including species covalently bonded to the latter one. Thanks to the description of physicochemically distinct adsorption interactions, new insights can also be offered in hydratation phenomena. =Paramagnetic systems= Another subject concerns the study of paramagnetic systems, such as 4Fe-4S, high spin Fe(II) catalyst, lanthanide-containing complexes or paramagnetic centers in proteins, with specific attention to the development of NMR methods specifically aimed at paramagnetic solids. =Solid-state NMR of proteins and bioaggregates= The CRMN was one of the groups developing tools and protocols for the structural and dynamic characterization of proteins in solid phase, including preparations of micro-crystalline samples, role of solvent, paramagnetic systems and sequential assignment, with a progressive introduction thanks to ultra-fast MAS of direct proton acquisition mimicking the sequences used for liquid NMR spectra. In collaboration with Martin Blackledge his team published some of the first ssNMR methods for the characterization of atom-specific dynamics in biosolids and its relation with solvent behaviour and function, providing detailed insight about the hierarchy of motions in proteins with the increase of temperature. =Whole organism NMR= With Laurent Ségalat Emsley showed on the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans the possibility to use ssNMR on a whole organism for the understanding of its metabolic pattern and the influence of drug assumption or genetic modifications.

It was located about a mile downriver from Peoria. History The town began with a ferry across the Willamette River run by John Smith, and a store owned by John Donald. James Freeman platted the townsite in 1853, at which time it had two houses, two stores, a blacksmith shop, and the ferry. The river silted up and made the boat landings inaccessible so the town's population soon dwindled. Some of the buildings were moved to Peoria. Burlington post office was established in 1855 and ran until 1857 when it was renamed Peoria and likely moved to the other town. Burlington was located on the Donation Land Claim of James Martin who came to Oregon from Little York, Illinois. A family tradition among Martin's descendants holds that Burlington was named after Burlington, Iowa, the nearest market town to Little York. Today Burlington, Oregon is considered a ghost town.

The charity is overseen by a Board, chaired by Rhiannon Spear and Tiffany Kane, and delivers services in schools across Scotland. Beginning its campaign, TIE initially put their case to the public petitions committee of the Scottish Parliament, however, despite finding some support their petition was rejected in January 2016. They were successful in achieving their aims in 2018 when The Scottish Government announced its intention to introduce LGBT-inclusive education in all public schools. TIE have received the backing of leading Scottish political figures, including Nicola Sturgeon, Patrick Harvie, Kezia Dugdale and Mhairi Black. At their 2016 Spring conference, the Scottish National Party moved a resolution to support the campaign and, during the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, all major parties adopted the group's calls for improved teacher training in their election manifestoes. TIE has the support of the Scottish Parliament, after a majority of MSPs signed the group's campaign pledge and committed to supporting their strategic proposals to advance LGBT inclusive education. In 2017, the Scottish Government formed an LGBTI Inclusive Education Working Group with TIE to consider policy recommendations to address the issues the campaign had raised, leading to the adoption of LGBT-inclusive education. TIE was shortlisted for Public Campaign of the Year at the 2016 Scottish Politician of the Year awards, and won Charity of the Year at the 2017 Icon Awards and 2019 Shelia McKechnie Foundation Awards. TIE succeeded in achieving its aims in November 2018, when The Scottish Government announced that the recommendations of its LGBTI Inclusive Education Working Group had been accepted in full, and that LGBT themes would be embedded into the national curriculum in all public schools. The charity's education work is currently ongoing, with its founders expressing that their work will not be over \\"until we live in a society where we are no longer required\\". History Time for Inclusive Education (TIE) was co-founded by Scottish campaigners Jordan Daly and Liam Stevenson, after the pair met following the Scottish independence referendum. It was launched on 28 June 2015, the 46th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, with assistance from Jimmy Reid Foundation project Common Weal. On 5 August 2015, Daly submitted an online petition to the Scottish Parliament on behalf of TIE, calling for the statutory inclusion of LGBT issues within all school curricula, arguing that \\"The current Scottish Education Curriculum allows schools to opt-out of progressive teaching programmes that discuss topics relating to the LGBTI+ community, such as the Relationships, Sexual Health and Parenthood (RSHP) framework. This is unproductive.\\" As the campaign progressed, TIE altered their initial aims and were joined by diversity campaigner and Knightswood Secondary School teacher John Naples-Campbell, who began to advise the group from the perspective of an educator. In October 2015, TIE released its first publication - Time for Inclusive Education - which consisted of the personal stories and testimony of individuals across Scotland, and outlined statistics uncovered by Stonewall Scotland in 2012. The publication was delivered to all 129 Members of the Scottish Parliament and featured contributions from various organisations, campaigners and individuals - including Equality Network, LGBT Youth Scotland, Stonewall Scotland, RISE - Scotland's Left Alliance and the Vale of Leven Academy LGBT committee. Campaigners at the Scottish Parliament. On 27 October 2015, Daly, Stevenson and Naples-Campbell appeared before the Scottish Parliament's Public Petitions Committee to give evidence to MSPs Kenny MacAskill, Hanzala Malik, Jackson Carlaw, Michael McMahon, John Wilson, David Torrance and Angus MacDonald. TIE proposed that every school have a teacher trained in how to teach LGBT issues. The committee agreed to write to the Scottish Government and relevant educational institutions, including the Educational Institute of Scotland and Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. The committee showed interest towards the proposals. In August 2016, TIE released a report entitled 'Attitudes Towards LGBT In Scottish Education', which uncovered statistics and trends in relation to LGBT issues in Scotland's schools. They found that 90% of LGBT respondents had reported experiencing homophobia, biphobia and transphobia while at school and 42% of LGBT respondents who had been bullied because of their identity had attempted suicide. The group also highlighted that teachers were unaware of 2014 government issued guidance around LGBT education in schools, with a majority claiming that they had 'never heard of' or 'never read' the materials. The report led to heightened calls for TIE's proposals to be implemented by the Scottish Government, with cross party MSPs such as Annie Wells, Monica Lennon, Ivan McKee, Patrick Harvie, Ross Thomson, Christina McKelvie and Jenny Gilruth publicly endorsing the campaign and consistently raising the issue within the debating chamber of the Scottish Parliament. In September 2016 TIE launched an online pledge, calling on members of the public and MSPs to sign their support for a five-point national strategy towards achieving LGBT inclusivity in schools. Among the proposals are calls for new legislation for LGBT inclusive education in all schools, teacher training and the recording of all incidents of homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying by Scottish local authorities. Many parliamentarians immediately signed the pledge, and this has led to an increased focus on the group's push for legislative reform. In November 2016, Jordan Daly represented TIE and gave evidence during a scoping session into bullying in schools for the Scottish Parliament's Equalities and Human Rights Committee. He argued that the human rights of LGBT young people are being breached in Scottish schools and that under the Equality Act 2010's Public Sector Duties, all publicly funded bodies are required to be proactive in eliminating prejudice and discrimination against protected characteristics, and so schools should be doing more to address homophobic bullying. He concluded by urging the Committee's MSPs; Annie Wells, Christina McKelvie, Alex Cole-Hamilton, Mary Fee, David Torrance, Jeremy Balfour and Willie Coffey, to move the group's proposals forward in order to advance the human rights of LGBT school pupils. Following the session, McKelvie requested that Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills John Swinney delay publishing the Scottish Government's recently updated National Approach to Anti-Bullying for Scotland's Children and Young People in order that it be scrutinised by MSPs. Swinney granted the request, and the publication has been put on hold until further notice. In December 2016, human rights lawyer Aamer Anwar – a vocal supporter of TIE – urged the Scottish Government to implement the group's proposals in order to \\"save lives\\", stating that \\"as long as young Scots continue to take their own lives because of their sexuality, then equality will remain a soundbite and sexual apartheid the reality.\\" He also addressed the debate as to whether LGBT education should be implemented in Scotland's faith schools, expressing concerns that faith schools having the option to opt-out of delivering LGBT guidance was a political decision. He stated that if TIE's proposals are to be adopted then they \\"must include religious schools, as there can be no opt out - no matter how politically inconvenient it may be.\\" As of February 2017, sixty-seven MSPs had signed TIE's campaign pledge to commit their support to the group's strategic proposals to achieve LGBT inclusive education. This marked a cross-party parliamentary majority in support of the campaign, placing the Scottish Parliament as the first in Europe to express majority support for the teaching of LGBT issues in schools. A second motion in support of the proposals outlined in TIE's pledge, and the formation of a working group with TIE representatives, was debated at the SNP's Spring Conference in March 2017 and passed with acclaim, having been supported by senior party politicians including Christina McKelvie and Jenny Gilruth. Aims TIE's campaigners claimed that the lack of LGBT education in Scottish schools was a \\"national disgrace\\", holding that \\"education is an absolutely vital tool to tackle homophobia, biphobic and transphobic behaviours, and discrimination, and it must be utilised.\\" It lists its primary aim as ensuring that all Scottish schools offer an education that is inclusive of LGBT topics, and outlined various methods to achieve this in its campaign pledge. TIE have argued that LGBT specific teacher training should be made available to all Scottish schools - including faith schools - and urged parties to commit to this during the 2016 Scottish parliamentary election period, claiming that: \\"it is vital that the next strategy to tackle LGBT- phobia in Scottish schools is the right one - for too long we have dealt with a Section 28 hangover, the next Scottish Government must tackle this properly.\\" Support Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has supported TIE. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has supported TIE. The campaign has gained cross party political support as well as endorsements from public figures across Scotland and internationally; including Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish Education Minister John Swinney, Welsh international rugby union referee Nigel Owens, CEO of Ditch the Label, Liam Hackett, human rights lawyer Aamer Anwar, Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell, journalist Owen Jones, actress Emma Thompson, American activist Alicia Garza, Patrick Harvie, Willie Rennie, Kezia Dugdale, Pat Nevin, David Torrance (journalist), Jonathon Shafi and Cat Boyd. The campaign has received the backing of the Scottish National Party's affiliated youth organisations, the Young Scots for Independence (SNP Youth) and Federation of Student Nationalists (SNP Students). Speaking after the decision was made, Rhiannon Spear - convenor of SNP Youth - claimed that \\"...the TIE campaign's values are directly in line with those of the Young Scots for Independence (SNP Youth), and we have made a commitment to campaign against all forms of discrimination and prejudice.\\" At their Spring conference in March 2016, the Scottish National Party moved a resolution from SNP Youth and SNP Students in support of TIE and the campaign's calls for inclusive LGBT education. Youth delegates spoke personally, all of whom cited statistics in the area which highlight higher rates of suicide and self-harm amongst LGBT school pupils. As a result, the party has committed to working with TIE to improve LGBT inclusivity within the Scottish education system. TIE's campaigners called the move \\"historic\\". In March 2016, actress Emma Thompson backed the campaign, stating that: \\"The time for homophobia is long gone. It's over. Any young person indulging in homophobic bullying is a teenage dinosaur who should just go and sit coughing over a sherry in an old white men’s club.\\" First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, expressed her support for TIE during the 2016 Scottish Parliament election campaign, stating that the group's work was \\"very impressive\\" and vowing to work with the campaigners during her current term in government. In April 2016, the Scottish Green Party launched an LGBT manifesto, in which they expressed their support for TIE, and committed to pushing for many of the campaign's aims within the Scottish parliament - including LGBT specific teacher training. The former Children and Young People's Commissioner Scotland, Tam Baillie, has also supported TIE's aims. He publicly backed the campaign in October 2016, arguing that the issues that had been raised by the campaigners regarding homophobic bullying in schools should be \\"addressed by the Scottish Government and education providers to ensure we live up to our international rights obligations and to create school communities based on equality and respect for all.\\" His successor, Bruce Adamson, has also supported the campaign and has strongly advocated the group's calls for legislation on LGBT inclusivity in schools. Columnist and author Owen Jones has also endorsed the campaign, insisting that \\"being exposed to homophobia, biphobia and transphobia at a young age can be damaging to LGBTI people for the rest of their lives\\". Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell, has also endorsed the group's calls. In December 2016, he stated that while he was accepted when he came out as gay earlier in the year, he is aware that there are \\"many LGBTI young people\\" who are being bullied at school. He agreed with the group's proposals for inclusive education, arguing that they should be implemented \\"to tackle prejudice and spread understanding in our schools, giving LGBTI young people equality and respect, which is their right.\\" The leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, has supported the campaign along with the leader of the Scottish Labour Party, Richard Leonard. In late 2017, the campaign was endorsed by the National Parent Forum of Scotland and Scouts Scotland. On 28 June 2018, as part of a stunt to mark TIE's third anniversary, MSPs from all parties wore custom made rainbow ties in the style of the charity's recognisable logo in the Scottish Parliament's debating chamber during First Minister's Questions. Trade Union Support In February 2016, UNISON became the first trade union to officially back the campaign following a speech from Daly at the union's Scottish council conference. Delegates pledged their continued support and gave a financial donation of £1000 - which TIE stated would be used to directly train groups of teaching staff in how to tackle LGBT-phobic behaviours and attitudes in their schools. Following this, the Scottish Trades Union Congress, which represents 39 affiliated trade unions and around 630,000 trade unionists, unanimously voted to endorse TIE. Willie Docherty of UNISON spoke in support of the campaign, stating: \\"A real education can only be in place when young people can be themselves and not have to worry about being bullied, ridiculed or just ignored because of who they are.\\" In June 2017 the Educational Institute of Scotland, the country's largest teacher's trade union, voted to affiliate to TIE. In doing so, the union adopted the group's proposals and officially supported the campaign. 2015: Response to Public Petition Scottish LGBT organisations have expressed their support for TIE's aims, with LGBT Youth Scotland writing to the Scottish Parliament's petitions committee, outlining that: \\"Improvements in LGBT students’ educational experiences have not been consistent within Scottish schools and there are still high levels of prejudice and exclusion.\\" Stonewall Scotland, in their written response, outlined their support for improved teacher training, holding that: \\"We would agree with the TIE campaign that there is significant inconsistency in the approach schools and local authorities take to addressing LGBT issues. Whilst we are delighted to see more schools addressing LGBT issues in a proactive way, they must be the rule and not the exception. We would welcome a clear strategy from the Scottish Government as to how they will systematically address the bullying and lack of support and experienced by LGBT young people in Scotland.\\" The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA), whilst in agreement that teachers must have knowledge of equalities issues, expressed concern regarding teacher training: outlining that \\"...this is a busy time for trainee teachers and that there are lots of other demands on their time\\", and that a teacher's understanding of human rights issues is \\"...likely to be gained and kept updated through information provided by their schools and through career-long professional learning.\\" The teachers' union, Educational Institute of Scotland, furthered this argument in their response: \\"...the EIS is of the view that practitioners are skilled in identifying their own professional learning needs.\\" Following their submission - which expressed concerns for the rights of religious parents and teachers - the EIS came under scrutiny on social media from many of its own members, leading the union to publish a clarification of their position, outlining that they \\"share the concerns of TIE\\". The Scottish Government responded to TIE's calls, stating that: \\"The Scottish Government is clear that there is no place in Scotland for prejudice or discrimination, and that everyone deserves to be treated fairly regardless of age, disability, gender, gender identity, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or sexual orientation. We must continue, unrelentingly, to tackle prejudice and discrimination and promote equality and diversity; and we must begin this work early in schools.\\" They outlined that they have taken specific action to tackle homophobic bullying in the past, with the creation of a teaching toolkit - and claimed that their next steps in tackling this would be to assess whether the current toolkit should be updated to provide teachers with the confidence to tackle homophobic bullying after the revised National Approach is published in 2016. 2016: Rejection of Public Petition On 12 January 2016, the petition put forward by TIE was unanimously rejected by the Public Petitions Committee. Ministers expressed sympathy with the campaign. Committee Convener Michael McMahon explained that the petition called for LGBT education to be engrained in statute, and that the school curricula are not statutory, with the exception of Religious and Moral Education. 2016: Glasgow Pride Partnership TIE Campaign march at Glasgow Pride SNP MPs supporting TIE Campaign at Glasgow Pride In May 2016, it was announced that Pride Glasgow had partnered with TIE for the city's annual Gay pride parade, which would be themed around the campaign. The move was praised for its political significance by campaigners. The parade took place in August 2016, and TIE were joined by various cross-party politicians including Mhairi Black, Alyn Smith, Angela Crawley, Patrick Harvie, Martin Docherty and Clare Haughey in calling for urgent action from the Scottish Government with regards to LGBT inclusivity within education. In a well received speech ahead of the parade, TIE co founder Liam Stevenson restated the campaign's aim of ensuring that LGBT issues were taught in all schools in an effort to tackle homophobic bullying, concluding that \\"...there are young people with laceration marks on their arms and young people who have committed suicide due to being bullied. Clearly we are not getting it right for every child - when is that going to change?\\" 2016: Hate crime incident In August 2016, it was reported that four teenagers were arrested and charged in connection with an incident of homophobic abuse in West Lothian. Footage was being filmed for a documentary about TIE, with LGBT young people speaking about their experiences of being bullied at school, when they were interrupted by the perpetrators who began \\"screaming homophobic abuse\\" at them. The case was resolved by the Scottish Children's Reporter Administration. 2017: Scottish Parliament majority In February 2017 sixty seven Members of the Scottish Parliament had signed TIE's campaign pledge, committing their support to the group's strategic proposals for LGBT inclusive education - including teacher training, legislation and curricular inclusion. The move places the Scottish Parliament as the first in the world to indicate majority support for the teaching of LGBT issues in schools. Speaking at the time, a TIE spokesperson stated that \\"It is important to recognise that this parliamentary mandate for our calls is a historical moment in the push for equal rights in Scotland\\", while Scottish Conservative MSP Ross Thomson claimed that \\"TIE have put the issue of LGBTI-inclusive education firmly to the top of the political agenda.\\" Party leaders Richard Leonard, Patrick Harvie and Willie Rennie are among the MSPs who have signed. By February 2018, seventy MSPs had pledged their support, along with thirty five of Scotland's MPs - meaning that a majority of all of the nation's parliamentarians had endorsed the campaign. 2017: Governmental working group In March 2017, a resolution calling on the Scottish Government to form a joint working group with TIE was debated and passed at the SNP's Spring Conference in Aberdeen. The resolution, moved by the SNP Youth, was supported by senior party politicians and many delegates spoke of their personal experiences of homophobia at school. The proposal for a working group was taken from TIE's strategy paper, which was released publicly in 2016. Following this, the Scottish Government formed the working group with TIE, and other relevant bodies, in order to implement the proposals outlined in TIE's campaign pledge - which has been supported by a majority of MSPs. On 19 April 2017, during a parliamentary debate on TIE led by Scottish Labour MSP Monica Lennon, the Scottish Government formally announced the launch of the working group. Members of the group will be tasked with the implementation of TIE's proposals and include representatives from: TIE, Stonewall Scotland, LGBT Youth Scotland, Educational Institute of Scotland, Equality and Human Rights Commission and the Scottish Catholic Education Services, amongst others. Campaigners and MSPs from all parties have insisted that the group must lead to \\"tangible action\\" and cannot delay. The group concluded policy recommendations in August 2018, and its LGBTI Inclusive Education Report to the Scottish Ministers was launched in the Scottish Parliament in November 2018. 2018: Success The campaign achieved its aims in November 2018, when The Scottish Government announced that it had accepted the recommendations of the Working Group in full and would be embedding LGBT themes across the national curriculum. The policy will apply to all public schools. TIE welcomed the news, claiming that the \\"destructive legacy\\" of Section 28 had been ended. The Scottish Government claimed that the changes were a \\"world first\\" and confirmed that the new curricular content would be nationally implemented by 2021. Impact The group's work and high-profile campaigning has led to a national debate in Scotland around the issue of LGBT inclusion in the education sector. Commentators have referred to the situation as \\"Scotland's new Section 28 culture war\\". In 2016, following the unanimous passing of a motion in favour of TIE at the SNP's conference, Nicola Sturgeon announced proposals to train teachers on equality issues in an effort to tackle homophobia in schools - in what the SNP described as a \\"leap forward\\" for LGBT equality. However, TIE argued that this \\"does not go far enough\\" as Sturgeon's proposals were not reflective of the expectations of the SNP membership. Commentators also noted that there was no specific commitment to funding for the training proposals, with leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats Willie Rennie agreeing with TIE in arguing that the SNP should go further than their pledge. Following the launch of their election manifesto, the party committed to working with TIE. Co-convener of the Scottish Green Party, Patrick Harvie, claimed that TIE has \\"been a really important new voice in the landscape of people campaigning on these issues\\" and outlined that \\"during the next session of the Scottish Parliament we have to see real progress. We wouldn’t even be in that position, of understanding how that progress had to happen, if it hadn’t been for the TIE campaign getting the ball rolling. It really is inspiring, the work they have done.\\" He stated that he, along with other members of the next Scottish parliament, would hold the SNP to account on their commitment to adopt TIE's proposals for LGBT inclusive education. In March 2016, during a leaders debate which focused on LGBT issues, all Scottish party leaders gave their support for LGBT inclusive education, with former leader of the Scottish Labour Party Kezia Dugdale stating: \\"Teachers aren't given enough time outside of the classroom to train on these issues. We've got to give them the confidence to teach LGBT issues.\\" In April 2017, during a parliamentary debate on the campaign, MSPs from all parties praised founders Jordan Daly and Liam Stevenson for their style of campaigning, citing the pair's \\"steely determination\\" and \\"radical edge\\" as indicative of the campaign's success. Services In June 2016, TIE launched a teacher training scheme which piloted in Glasgow and Edinburgh in October 2016. The campaigners claimed that the initiative was a response to the \\"systematic barriers which prevent schools from becoming inclusive of LGBTI young people\\", such as the financial costs attributed to the training programmes that other organisations offer. TIE's training is the first of its kind which is available to teaching staff free of charge and has content which is inclusive of teachers and pupils in the additional support needs sectors. It is delivered by teaching staff Scott Mowat, John Naples-Campbell and Danielle Campbell. TIE also provide free of charge assemblies, workshops and seminars to Scottish primary and secondary schools covering LGBT issues, homophobic bullying and gender stereotypes. Controversy TIE has often attracted controversy, particularly concerning its founders' position that Catholic schools should not be exempt or allowed to opt-out from delivering LGBT education. In August 2016, SNP depute leadership election contenders Alyn Smith MEP and Councillor Chris McEleney were at the centre of a clash over the campaign and its position concerning Catholic schools. Smith, writing for The National newspaper, had expressed his support for TIE and stated that \\"we’re more than capable of setting what our schools need to do, we need to set the bar a bit higher on LGBTI issues. In all schools, no exceptions\\". In response, McEleney insisted that \\"it should be up to [parents] what they want for the future of their children's education\\" and defended Catholic schools. In September 2016, SNP and Scottish Labour councillors in Glasgow City Council became embroiled in a row after SNP Councillor Angus Millar's proposed motion in support of TIE was dropped after the full council ran over time and could not debate the motion. There were suggestions from the floor to extend the meeting to ensure that the motion could be discussed, but this was overruled by council leader Frank McAveety and deputy leader Archie Graham. Following a public backlash, Millar wrote to McAveety recommending that he meet with TIE campaigners and expressing his disapproval of the events, highlighting that: \\"Our city’s schools must be safe, accepting and inclusive environments for young people of LGBTI+ identities to learn in, but too many young people experience homophobic and transphobic abuse, with deeply damaging consequences for their mental and emotional wellbeing.\\" In December 2016, Aamer Anwar addressed the debate as to whether LGBT education should be implemented in Scotland's faith schools. He expressed concerns that faith schools having the option to opt-out of delivering LGBT guidance was a political decision, and stated that if TIE's proposals are to be adopted then they \\"must include religious schools, as there can be no opt out - no matter how politically inconvenient it may be.\\" In January 2017, Reverend John Nugent of the Church of Scotland endorsed the campaign and addressed the division between campaigners and some religious groups over the issue, arguing that the mainstream faith agenda must be \\"seized back from the bigots\\" opposed to LGBT inclusive education. Criticism The campaign has been criticised by Reverend David Robertson of the Free Church of Scotland, who claimed that its aims were in breach of the rights of Christian parents. Writing to the Scottish Parliament, Robertson expressed his concern that TIE's petition was a \\"Trojan horse to impose an ideological perspective on all pupils, whether they want it or not\\". Responding to the announcement that TIE's proposals for teacher training were to be adopted by the SNP, Michael McGrath - former director of the Scottish Catholic Education Service - stated \\"If it means promoting homosexual activity then that is not the job of a government—to be promoting any form of sexual activity\\" and highlighted that he did not expect that Catholic schools would be involved. Writing in the Scottish Catholic Observer, former school teacher Hugh McLoughlin claimed that \\"war was openly declared on our Scottish catholic education system\\" as a result of party leaders' supporting TIE. He further argued that, by discussing his suicidal convictions as a young gay teenager, Daly was \\"shamelessly\\" deploying an emotional tool to \\"affect political and public sentiment\\" to achieve an agenda of LGBT inclusion within the education system. He dismissed TIE's claims that homophobia is a problem in schools and stated that poverty and discrimination against Catholic youth were bigger issues.

Rival software TurnItIn had reported a rate of plagiarism of 15%, several times more than that reported by Spanish Government using PlagScan. The company replied \\"After applying the software internally – using the default settings and no filters – PlagScan cannot confirm this number. An initial scan revealed 21 percent of duplicated content. In order to receive a 0.96 percent result, one must have applied specific settings and actively disqualified sources.

A cultureme is a \\"cultural information-bearing unit\\", the contents of which are recognizable by a group of people. Culturemes are the bridge between linguistic units and culture. Their usage can be seen in cultural expressions, phraseologisms, jokes, slogans, literature, religion, folklore, sociology, anthropology, etc.Luque Nadal, L. (2009): \\"Los culturemas: ¿unidades lingüísticas, ideológicas o culturales?\\" en Language Design 11, págs. 93-120 All of which are subcultures in a culture system. Culturemes of this nature have historical relevance that when translated or explained result in a miscommunication and misunderstanding. The notion of cultureme is being increasingly used in translation studies and other disciplines. It is a recently used concept that is yet to be defined and distinguished from others, such as phraseme, idiom, symbol, cultural word, etc.  Phases of a Cultureme  Fernando Poyatos breaks down the features of a cultureme into four phases. These phases analysis the broadest of culturemes to the most particular aspects of culturemes. = Phase One: Basic Culturemes = Basic culturemes are the broadest of culturemes. They characterize the initial semblance of a culture. Basic culturemes are separated into two cultural \\"realms,\\" urban and rural, and two domains: exterior and interior. Basic culturemes begin with urban and rural realms because of their dichotomy in cultural identity and displays of social interactions. Within either cultures, there are exteriors (what is observed from the outside) and interiors (what is observed from the inside of buildings or establishments that are not seen from an outdoors perspective). The main divisions of culturemes are: urban-exterior, urban-interior, rural-exterior, and rural- interior. The significance of basic culturemes is to give a general sense of surroundings. For instance, > \\"in North America (United States and Canada): the larger size of many > automobiles, the summery sound and smell of lawn mowing, the smell of city > bus exhausts, the basic separation of the 'downtown' business and > residential areas in the small town or village, the sirens of their police > cars, the smell of hamburger and French fries of many eating establishments, > the unique drugstore smell, the 'Licensed' signs in many second-rate > restaurants (indicating a cultural attitude towards drinking\\" = Phase Two: Primary Culturemes = Primary culturemes exist in the phase when acculturation occurs, in which one's culture is becoming more complex. The basic four culturemes are subcategorized into environmental (cultural settings) and behavioral (behaviors of people and their interactions). These culturemes are a result of recognizing cultural patterns and \\"experiencing it through mere observation or systemic learning.\\" = Phase Three: Secondary Culturemes = Culturemes are further broken down into settings, in which a specific culture is exemplified. These includes cultures in the school, the park, the bar, etc. These are secondary culturemes. Phase three is the point where the cultures identified in phase two begin to interact; interrelationships are seen among different cultural systems and values. = Phase Four: Tertiary Culturemes = Phase four delves deeper into human senses, analyzing to the fullest extent possible. The completion of phase four allows one to identify the cultureme's cultural system and subculture. Knowing the cultural system and subculture are important as it helps to navigate through other identifiable systems within the culture.  Translation  Translating a cultureme can be challenging, as connotations are sometimes very strong. For instance: the Spanish word alcázar means \\"the castle\\", \\"palace\\" or \\"fortress\\", but, as it is of Arabic origin, it recalls eight centuries of history (Al Andalus), which cannot be easily translated into English, so the translator must adopt a crucial decision: either choose the English word \\"fortress\\" and lose all the historical and cultural connotations, or use the loan word alcazar.Translation of culturemes for tourism A language may have various cultures and various languages may share the same culture. Cultures may differ in conceptualization that may in turn affect how thoughts are conveyed in their languages. The asymmetry of language complicates the matter of providing a linguistically and culturally sound equivalent of a cultureme in another language. The complex relationship of language and culture is significant in giving culturemes their intended value. Dictionaries further complicate cross-cultural gaps of meaning because without the collaborative effort of all cultures, it is impossible to define the significance of words that may be culturemes in the dictionary. Though, slowly, interactive and multimedia dictionaries have become extensive in information that lessen the bridge across languages and cultures. Culturemes are translated in several ways: * Literal translation: Language of the cultureme is rendered in another language in attempts to convey the same core meaning. * Functional equivalence: Translating meaning without the inclusion of its cultural association. * Near-synonymy: A translation has a similar meaning to the cultureme without being identical. * Under-specification: A space-saving technique that give a short and manageable definition. * Distortion: A translation that does not preserve the same meaning as the cultureme. * Explanation: A translator uses this technique in their efforts to get the audience to fully understand the meaning. This can involve lengthy and overly detailed descriptions. * Category change: In the instance that the cultureme is obsolete or no longer relevant, a modern-day equivalent is provided. * Glossary: A given text provides a definition at the end * Over-specification: More information is given than required. * No translation: Some culturemes are kept in their original language. This applies mainly to Roman script languages, though other languages may have their culturemes romanized. * Omission: The translator may omit what they judge to be peripheral in what is meant to be said. = Culture: Norms, Ideas, and Materials = In translating, the inability to convey cultural meaning strips a cultureme of its \\"cultureme\\" title and it simply becomes an ambiguous word. Culture is classified into three categories: Norms, Ideas, and Materials. * Norms refer to the habits and traditions of a societal group. A culture with a foundation of politeness that uses honorific terms of address, such as in the Korean language, has very intricate forms of pronouns that have nonequivalence in other languages, e.g. English. Different cultures and languages have different interpretations of politeness that affects how successful a cultureme is translated. Traditional holidays are norms in a culture. The Vietnamese New Year Tết is a cultureme of the Vietnamese language and culture. Tết signifies the start of the new year on the Lunar calendar. It is a day of being home with family and cheerful celebration. A literal translation of Tết to English would be \\"New Year.\\" But, anyone who had no knowledge of the cultureme would think the traditions and practices of \\"New Year's\\" all the same. *Ideas refer to \\"scientific truths, religious beliefs, myths, legends, works of literature, superstitions, aphorisms, proverbs, and folklore.\\" These culturemes are deep rooted in shared, personal history that outsiders of a culture are unfamiliar with knowing. Culturemes pertaining to cultural ideas do not need explained in the present, their meanings and significance are cemented in the people's knowledge. *Materials refer to physical culture. Food, for instance, is an important example of tangible culture; it can illustrate dietary culture/lifestyle. Certain dishes are staples of the culture and can be a product of the local surroundings. The existence of a food or dish may have historical relevance to a culture. Translation in recipes that involve food cultureme can result in the wrong ingredients being introduced.

He was director of Courtaulds from 1946 to 1962, served as a director of the Bank of England from 1936 to 1963, and held various positions in the royal household. Early life Hanbury-Williams was born in Henley-on-Thames, the son of Major-General Sir John Hanbury-Williams and Annie Emily Reiss. He was educated at Wellington College. He began his business career at Rice Bros. in London and Manchester, prior to the First World War breaking out. He served in France with the 10th Royal Hussars and also served at General Headquarters. He was wounded during the war and mentioned in despatches. Career In 1926, Hanbury-Williams joined textile company Courtaulds in Coventry before being transferred to the company's headquarters in London. He concentrated on the company's yarn trade overseas and soon oversaw administration of Courtaulds' foreign-affiliated companies. In 1930, he was elected to the company's board of directors. In 1935, he was appointed a managing director, concentrating on the companies international trade. He was directly involved in the founding of British Cellophane. In 1936, Hanbury-Williams was elected to the court of directors of the Bank of England, and served as a director until his retirement in February 1963. From 1940 to his retirement, he also served as a member of the Bank of England's Committee of Treasury. Prior to the Second World War, Hanbury-Williams was responsible for Courtaulds involvement with nylon, invented in 1935 by DuPont. After the War began, he worked full-time as an executive director of the Bank of England in 1940–41. In 1942, he served under the Minister of Economic Warfare, Lord Selborne. In 1943, he returned to Courtaulds and was appointed deputy chairman. In 1946, he succeeded Samuel Courtauld as chairman of the company. Courtaulds had suffered during the wartime years and had been forced to sell off its almost wholly owned American subsidiary, the American Viscose Corporation, for badly needed dollars for Great Britain. Post-war, the company also needed to replenish its staff across the board and underwent a period of major recruitment. A particular achievement for Hanbury-Williams was the return to the United States in 1951 with the establishment of a new American subsidiary, Courtaulds, Inc. Additionally, Hanbury-Williams served as chairman of the Prime Minister's Committee on the ordering procedure for civil aircraft in 1948; honorary treasurer (and later a trustee) of the Commonwealth Study Conference at Oxford in 1956; president of the International Association for the Protection of Industrial Property in 1959–60; and a vice-president of the National Council for Social Service. Hanbury-Williams was knighted in the 1950 New Year Honours, for public services. Courtier Hanbury-Williams became a Gentleman Usher to George V in 1931, and served as Gentleman Usher to Edward VIII in 1936. Between 1936 and 1965 Hanbury-Williams held the office of Lieutenant of the City of London.

The sum of any 360-gon's interior angles is 64440 degrees. Regular 360-gon properties A regular 360-gon is represented by Schläfli symbol {360} and also can be constructed as a truncated 180-gon, t{180}, or a twice-truncated enneacontagon, tt{90}, or a thrice-truncated tetracontapentagon, ttt{45}. One interior angle in a regular 360-gon is 179°, meaning that one exterior angle would be 1°. The area of a regular 360-gon is (with ) :A = 90t^2 \\\\cot \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{360} and its inradius is :r = \\\\frac{1}{2}t \\\\cot \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{360} The circumradius of a regular 120-gon is :R = \\\\frac{1}{2}t \\\\csc \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{360} Since 360 = 23 × 32 × 5, a regular 360-gon is not constructible using a compass and straightedge,Constructible Polygon but is constructible if the use of an angle trisector is allowed.  Symmetry The symmetries of a regular 360-gon. Symmetries are related as index 2 subgroups in each box. The 6 boxes are related as 3 and 5 index subgroups. The regular 360-gon has Dih360 dihedral symmetry, order 720, represented by 360 lines of reflection. Dih360 has 23 dihedral subgroups: (Dih180, Dih90, Dih45), (Dih120, Dih60, Dih30, Dih15), (Dih72, Dih36, Dih18, Dih9), (Dih40, Dih20, Dih10, Dih5), (Dih24, Dih12, Dih6, Dih3), and (Dih8, Dih4, Dih2, Dih1). And 24 more cyclic symmetries: (Z360, Z180, Z90, Z45), (Z120, Z60, Z30, Z15), (Z72, Z36, Z18, Z9), (Z40, Z20, Z10, Z5), (Z24, Z12, Z6, Z3), and (Z8, Z4, Z2,Z1), with Zn representing π/n radian rotational symmetry. These 48 symmetries are related to 66 distinct symmetries on the 360-gon. John Conway labels these lower symmetries with a letter and order of the symmetry follows the letter.John H. Conway, Heidi Burgiel, Chaim Goodman-Strauss, (2008) The Symmetries of Things, (Chapter 20, Generalized Schaefli symbols, Types of symmetry of a polygon pp. 275-278) Full symmetry is r720 and a1 labels no symmetry. He gives d (diagonal) with mirror lines through vertices, p with mirror lines through edges (perpendicular), i with mirror lines through both vertices and edges, and g for rotational symmetry. These lower symmetries allows degrees of freedom in defining irregular 360-gons. Only the g360 symmetry has no degrees of freedom but can seen as directed edges.  Dissection Coxeter states that every zonogon (a 2m-gon whose opposite sides are parallel and of equal length) can be dissected into m(m-1)/2 parallelograms.Coxeter, Mathematical recreations and Essays, Thirteenth edition, p.141 In particular this is true for regular polygons with evenly many sides, in which case the parallelograms are all rhombi. For the regular 360-gon, m=180, and it can be divided into 16110: 90 squares and 89 sets of 180 rhombs. This decomposition is based on a Petrie polygon projection of a 180-cube. { class=wikitable + Examples 240px 240px } 360-gram A 360-gram is a 360-sided star polygon.

Upper Chuvashs wore long footwraps and puttees. Feet wrapping was thick, similar to that of Finno Ugric neighbours. Virjal had black broadcloth footwraps, Anat Jenchi (Middle Lower Chuvashs) had black and white ones, and Anatri had just white. Dialect In Virjal dialect vowel о [o] is often used instead of literary у [u] and sometimes others: окçа [okśa] instead of укçа [ukśa] (money), орпа [orpa] instead of урпа [urpa] (barley). Plural affix -сам [-sam] is often used instead of literary -сем [-sem]: лашасам [laşasam] instead of лашасем [lașasem] (horses). As opposed to subgroups of some adjacent ethnicities like Maris and Mordvins which have distinctive differences between dialects, Chuvash dialects and specific ethnic subgroup cultural features developed relatively late. It is evidence of Chuvash ancestors in pre-Mongol era were basically united Bulgarian nation which was in process of ethnic consolidation. At the same time all the basic features of common Bulgarian language were formed on basis of different tribal dialects consolidation. Bulgarian language later became a foundation of Chuvash language.Иванов В.П., Николаев В.В., Димитриев В.Д.

It achieved considerable popularity and went through numerous editions. The third edition, published in 1781, was censored in France.Andrew S. Curran, Diderot and the Art of Thinking Freely, Other Press, 2019, p. 361 The Histoire des deux Indes filled a public need for knowledge in the Age of Enlightenment, answering questions that preoccupied the minds of those in the late 18th century, around the time of the French Revolution. Content Raynal's idea was to write a history of European enterprises in the East Indies and the New World, having observed the influence of the great explorations on European civilisation. The book first discusses the Portuguese and their oriental colonies, going on to give a history of British and French enterprises, then Spanish and Dutch, in the Orient. It then turns its attention to European conquests in the Americas, giving an account of atrocities against slaves in New Guinea and presenting a table of French and British colonies in North America, after which there is a series of essays on religion, politics, war, commerce, moral philosophy, belles-lettres, and so on. Style The Histoire des deux Indes lacks consistency in its style: Raynal limited himself to collecting articles provided by friends and pieces borrowed from existing published texts, without taking the trouble to rework them. Authors Although the book was published anonymously, some authors are known, if only in name. * According to Melchior Grimm, Denis Diderot contributed a large part of the work.Nevertheless, see the Lettre apologétique de l’abbé Raynal à monsieur Grimm (1781). He is certainly one of its main contributors, and it is estimated he wrote between a third and a fifth of the book, especially the parts on philosophical themes.Andrew S. Curran, Diderot and the Art of Thinking Freely, Other Press, 2019, p. 364 * The nineteenth chapter, summarising doctrine and drawing conclusions, was by Alexandre Deleyre. * On subjects concerning commerce, Raynal used the writings of Jacques Paulze, d’Aranda and Manuel de Faria e Sousa. * On philosophical subjects, in addition to Diderot, he used the writings of Paul Henri Thiry d'Holbach, Jacques-André Naigeon and Jean de Pechméja * He also used work by Abbé Martin, the medical doctor Dubreuil, Valadier, Jean-François de Saint- Lambert, Joseph-Louis Lagrange and Jacques-André Naigeon. Proud of his work, Raynal sometimes forgot it was only as good as its contributors made it. This can be seen in the pieces supplied by a Dr Sanchez, the author on Portugal and its possessions in the East and West Indies. Pechméja once found Sébastien- Roch Nicolas de Chamfort reading the Histoire des deux Indes: \\"What have you found?\\", he asked. \\"I have just been reading an excellent piece, but it finishes with such an awful turn of phrase\\" (). \\"Let me see: you're right. I much think that Raynal writes is nonsense; he has added that phrase, the rest is mine\\". () When Raynal left Paris, Chamford said (\\"He is tired of living with his author\\"). Reception Portrait of Guillaume-Thomas Raynal signing the third edition The Histoire des deux Indes was a great success. In France, over thirty different editions were published between 1770 and 1787, and over fifty were published abroad. Abridged versions were published called (\\"Potted Raynal\\") and (\\"Children's Raynal\\"). Napoleon Bonaparte proclaimed himself a \\"willing disciple of Raynal\\" () and took the book with him on his Egyptian campaign. Horace Walpole wrote to Marie Du Deffand: \\"It attacks all governments and all religions!\\" ( Anne Robert Jacques Turgot heavily criticized the book in a letter to André Morellet: (He is sometimes rigorous as Richardson, sometimes immoral as Helvetius, sometimes enthusiastic of soft and tender virtues, sometimes of debauchery, sometimes of fierce courage ; treating slavery as abominable and willing slaves; deraisonnant in physics, deraisonnant in metaphysics and often in politics. It does not follow anything of his book, if the author is a man of great intelligence, well educated, but has no fixed idea, who is carried away by the enthusiasm of a young rhetorician. He seems to have undertaken the task of supporting all the paradoxes that are presented to him in his lectures and in his dreams.) At the time, the Histoire des deux Indes was considered an encyclopaedia of the colonial age and the Bible of anticolonialism in the Age of Enlightenment. In 1780, Raynal produced the third edition of his Histoire philosophique des deux Indes, which was characterised by bolder and more violent tirades than the previous two, and under his signature at the bottom of his portrait he added the inscription: (\\"In defence of humanity, truth, and freedom\\"). Louis XVI referred the book to the Parlement de Paris for censorship, and also to the Church. It was banned, and burned by the public hangman on 29 May 1781. Declared a public enemy, Raynal was forced to leave France for Prussia, where he stayed the large part of his exile. He was allowed to return to France in 1787, on condition he did not enter Paris.

They crossed the Blue Ridge Mountains not far from present-day Floyd, Virginia and made their way into the New River Valley. Not primarily interested in exploring or map making, let alone establishing permanent farms and communities, they depended on friendly relations with Indians and profitable relations with fur-bearing animals. Deliberate exploration parties pushed west across the Blue Ridge as early as the 1670s, long before the settlement of what is now Montgomery County. Abraham Wood sent out a party of exploration, probably along the Trader's Path, in 1671 from what is now Petersburg, Virginia. The party included his brother, Thomas Wood; Thomas Batts, Robert Fallam; and an Indian guide, Perecute. The men made their way up the Roanoke River to present-day Salem, Virginia, across the Allegheny Ridge, along Stroubles Creek, and down a river-they called it Wood's River, though it later acquired the name New River-into present-day western Giles County, Virginia.

There have been religious buildings on the site since the 4th century AD, which were repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt during the Early Middle Ages. The present basilica was constructed in stages between the 12th and 15th centuries. It was severely damaged in World War I (1914–18), and was only reopened in 1956 after extensive reconstruction. Origins The town of Saint-Quentin has been identified with the Roman city of Augusta Veromandurorum, a commercial center at an important crossroads. It takes its present name from the Christian missionary Saint Caius Quintinus, who was beheaded there in 287 AD. Legend says the body was found many years later in the nearby marches of the River Somme by a Roman widow named Eusebia. She reburied the remains at the top of the hill at the center of the present town and built a small shrine to the martyr. Excavations round the crypt of the present church have indeed found traces of a building from this date. Some sources say the town became the seat of a bishopric around 365, but after barbarians destroyed it in 531 the bishop moved to Noyon. The chapel is listed as a pilgrimage destination by Gregory of Tours (–594). Saint Eligius (–660), Bishop of Noyon and counselor to Dagobert I, Merovingian king of France, rediscovered the tomb in the 7th century \\"under the pavement of the basilica\\". There are records of Saint Eligius having enlarged the building. Remains of a floor from this period have been found near the crypt. A large fragment of mosaic has been preserved. The first community of monks was established in or around Saint-Quentin by the mid-7th century, probably by Irish monks with the backing of the bishops of Noyon. The bishops claimed ecclesiastic jurisdiction over most of Vermandois, including Saint-Quentin. The church was rebuilt with the assistance of Charlemagne (–814), and consecrated by Pope Stephen IV (r. 816–817). There may have been two churches in the early Middle Ages, one dedicated to Saint Quentin and the other to the Virgin Mary. Archaeologists have found the remains of walls from the Carolingian period, when the location was a flourishing monastery and pilgrimage site. Limited archaeological investigations indicate that the crypt in the section of the nave between the two transepts may have replaced a Carolingian crypt with a circular corridor. The church was burned down by the Normans in 816, rebuilt in 824 and burned down again in 883. The site was fortified after 883. In 900 the bodies of Saint-Quentin and two other saints were placed in stone sarcophagi in a newly constructed crypt. In the 10th century the Herbertian counts of Vermandois, principally Adalbert I (Albert the Pious –987), replaced the monks with a congregation of secular canons. The counts claimed the title of abbot, and were overlords of the church. A dean administered the collegiate church. The dean was appointed by the count and reported only to the count, not to the bishop of Noyon and then to the archbishop of Reims. There are records of rebuilding in the mid-10th century. The church was damaged during local warfare in 1102–03. At one time Count Raoul of Vermandois (–52) was thought to have rebuilt the church, but this now seems unlikely. The canons of the collegiate chapter lived in separate houses within the church precincts, and most were not ordained priests. Often they were property owners and businessmen from noble families and main role was to administer the chapter's property. By 1200 the chapter was large and prosperous, with 72 canons. The semi-independent counts of Vermandois were originally closely associated with the County of Flanders, but gradually came under French control, a process that was completed when Eleanor of Vermadois died in 1214. That year Cardinal Robert of Courçon instituted a reform whereby ordained parish priests in nine parish churches would administer the sacraments, independent of the chapter, although they would pay the chapter a portion of their fees for baptisms, marriages and funerals. The construction of the huge new collegiate church may have been motivated in part by a desire of the collegiate chapter to reassert its authority after loss of jurisdiction to the town authorities and the parish priests. History Reliquary of the skull of Saint Quentin =Construction= A tower, now the bell tower, was started around 1170. It was completed between 1195 and 1200. Around 1190 the canons decided to build a more imposing church to welcome the growing numbers of pilgrims. The apse was completed in 1205. The apse was some distance to the east of the tower. Construction then continued westward from the apse towards the 12th-century tower, which eventually became the entrance to the collegiate church. There were frequent disputes between the chapter and the Bishops of Noyon, whose authority they refused to recognize. In the early 1220s Bishop Gérard de Bazoches placed the chapter under interdict, but in 1228 Pope Gregory IX rescinded the interdict. That year Nicolas de Roye, who was related to several of the canons, became the new bishop after Gérard's death. Later in 1228 the relics of Saint Quentin, Saint Victoric of Amiens and Saint Cassian of Auxerre were moved from the old crypt to a temporary location in the nave. The remains of the saints were exposed for veneration. Their heads, hands and arms were detached from their bodies, and each body part was placed in its own reliquary. After completion of the sanctuary the reliquaries were placed behind the high altar. The crypt, its tombs now empty, was preserved as a sacred place. Medieval fresco A synod was held in the church in August 1231. The archbishop sat in the center of the apse, with the bishops of Soissons, Beauvais, Noyon, Tournai and Senlis to his left, and the bishops of Laon, Châlons, Amiens, Thérouanne and Arras to his right. In 1257 Louis IX of France (1214–70) (Saint Louis) attended a great ceremony in which the relics of the saint were translated to the choir. The choir was mostly completed at that time apart from the high windows, which were built in the last third of the 13th century. Construction proceeded slowly due to lack of funds and structural problems. In 1316 the master mason Jean Le Bel had to strengthen the pillars of the choir. His successor, Gilles Largent, repaired the cracked vaults in 1394. In 1417 Louis XI of France (1423–83) donated 1,000 gold crowns to completely rebuild the south arm of the small transept, which was at risk of collapsing. The large transept was completed in the middle of the 15th century. The nave was completed in 1456, finally linking the apse to the 12th- century tower of St. Michel. The portal in the tower was completed in 1477. In 1509 foundations were laid for a massive facade with two towers to replace the existing entrance tower, but this project was soon abandoned due to lack of funds. =Fire, war and revolution= Ruined basilica on 14 October 1918 The building was damaged by a large fire in 1545, and by another fire during the Spanish siege of 1557. There was yet another fire in 1669. During the French Revolution (1789–99) the building was damaged by Jacobins who converted it into a Temple of Reason, then a fodder store and a stable. The building was given a Monument historique classification in 1840. During the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71) the building damaged by 18 shells on 19 January 1871. The building was designated a minor basilica in 1876 by Pope Pius IX. During World War I (1914–18) the city was occupied by German forces on 28 August 1914. The priest managed to hide the most valuable possessions. On 1 July 1916 an allied airplane dropped a bomb on the railway station, which ignited a wagon of explosives. Great damage was done to the buildings of the city by the explosion, and seven of the large windows of the basilica were broken. The city was evacuated on 15 March 1917. The church roof was destroyed by fire on 15 August 1917. When French forces recaptured Saint-Quentin on 1 October 1918 they arrested a German engineer who was preparing to blow up the severely damaged building. 93 holes had been made in the walls and pillars and filled with explosives for this purpose. By then the vaulting of the central nave had completely collapsed. Parts of the flying buttresses had been destroyed, and the walls and buttresses had many breaches. There was a risk that falls of unstable masonry could trigger larger collapses. =Modern reconstruction= Labyrinth (foreground) Reconstruction of the basilica began in 1919, directed by the Historical Monuments Commission. Emile Brunet was charged with reconstruction. As a first step about of cut stone and rubble were cleared by German prisoners of war. Some further damage was caused to carvings and decorations in the process. Specialized workers undertook urgent reinforcements of masonry, and parts of damaged sculptures were stored for later restoration. A temporary roof was built to protect the structure from weather, covered by fibro-cement and Ruberoid sheeting. It took 25 years to complete the basic restoration. The surviving 13th-century stained glass windows were reinstalled in 1948, with modern windows made by Hector de Pétigny (1904–92) to replace those that were missing, The restored basilica was reopened for worship in 1956. The steeple over the transept crossing was only finished in 1983. Further restoration work was undertaken in 2006 to clean the walls and restore the gatehouse to its state at the end of the 17th century. Building =Dimensions= thumb The basilica is the largest religious building in Picardy after Amiens Cathedral. It is long and high. The nave is wide. There are 110 windows. The 1976 steeple gives the building of height. The entrance tower is high. The interior is long, wide, and rises to below the vault. =Exterior= The building has a bold design with flamboyant details. It shows the evolution of the Gothic style during its lengthy construction period. It has a square tower above the transept crossing topped by a slender steeple that was installed in 1983. The entrance to the church dates from the 9th century. It was once part of the Carolingian church, and has been extensively modified. It now has three levels above the semi-circular entrance. There is a chapel dedicated to Saint Michael above the entrance passage. The central section of the building is braced by flying buttresses and by the side aisles. The two transepts, of unequal width, add to the monumental strength of the building. The facade of the north arm is attributed to Gilles Largent, and is notable for its sober composition. =Interior= Choir, ambulatory and radiating chapels The nave is built to a conventional 12th-century plan with three levels: arcades, triforium and high windows. The great high window is crowned by a magnificent star with five branches. The rich medieval decoration of the interior has been lost. The floor of the nave has an octagonal labyrinth of black and white paving stones from the late 15th century, in length. The pilgrim was invited to follow the complex course of black stones before opening his soul to God. One wall of the nave has a half relief stone sculpture of the Tree of Jesse, the genealogy of Christ, from the 16th century. To the east of the main transept there are four straight bays of choir and then a second, narrower transept. The curved structure of the east end extends from this transept. The choir and chevet assembly was probably built between around 1220 to 1257. The double-transept plan is found in the Cluny abbey church of 1088, but is otherwise very unusual in France. The concept seems to have come from England, where it was becoming popular at the time. The south branch of the small transept was almost ruined in 1460, and was completely rebuilt by Colard Noël in Flamboyant Gothic style. The north branch is mostly the original 13th-century structure, although the windows were remodeled in the 15th century. The ambulatory has a scalloped eastern wall from which five radiating chapels open. Each chapel is round, with independent dome-like vaulting and is lower than the ambulatory, so a clerestory above the chapels can illuminate the ambulatory. The chapels, built around 1190, are each brightly lit by seven windows. They each open onto the ambulatory through three arches divided by two columns. =Organ= The organ was completely destroyed by fire in 1669. A new grand organ was donated by Louis XIV of France, completed in 1703. It fills the space above the last bay of the nave. The organ case was built by Robert Clicquot between 1699 and 1703. The cabinet was drawn by Jean Bérain. Its rich design incorporates large seraphim angels with outstretched wings, cherub musicians and a medallion representing the Assumption of the Virgin supported by two angels. There is a statue of the apostle Quentin on the central turret, executed by Pierre Vaideau, one of the king's carpenters. The support platform was made by the local sculptor Girard de la Motte. In 1840 Antoine Sauvage, a follower of Aristide Cavaillé-Coll, undertook a full restoration. He installed a Barker machine and made changes that reflected the new romantic aesthetic. In 1917 the piping was melted, the mechanism destroyed and the cabinet seriously damaged. The cabinet was rebuilt during the restoration of the basilica. Haerpfer-Erman of Boulay-Moselle, was given the job of reconstructing the organ in 1961, and the new organ was inaugurated on 27–28 May 1967. It has four keyboards with 61 notes and a pedal with 32 notes. File:Ruins of Cathedral of St. Quentin.

She was the first Canadian female short track speed skater to win three individual Olympic medals in a single Olympics and the first Canadian woman to win an Olympic medal in the 1,500 m. As a result of her three medal performance she was named the flag bearer for Canada at the closing ceremonies for the 2018 Winter Olympics. Boutin has also won junior and senior world championship and World Cup medals. On November 3, 2019, she set a new world-record time of 41.936 seconds in the women's 500m event, becoming the first woman to skate the 500 in under 42 seconds. Career =2018 Winter Olympics= Boutin participated as part of Canada's team at the 2018 Winter Olympics. She came in 4th in the Women's 500 m, but following the judge's disqualification of South Korean Choi Min-jeong who finished 2nd in a photo finish, Boutin was awarded the bronze. Reports initially suggested the disqualification was due to contact with race winner Arianna Fontana, but were later stated to be due to an earlier contact with Boutin. The following day, it was announced that Boutin had been receiving negative comments from South Koreans, including reports of death threats. The Canadian Olympic Committee took the threats very seriously and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police were investigating the incidents. It was an emotional and painful experience for the skater and, upon receiving her medal, she was photographed in tears. She said later of it all that \\"it was pretty tough. I'm a sensitive person.\\" Boutin started in the 1,500 m heats with the threats still looming over her. She said that \\"of course, it scared me, and just after my warm-up, I cried. I cried a lot, because I was scared. But I have a pretty awesome team behind me.\\" She would put that fear behind her in the final of the 1,500 m when she skated out in front and led the pack until the second last lap when she was passed by Choi, but hung on for the bronze medal. This was her second individual medal of the games and made her the first female Canadian short track speed skater to win two individual medals in a single Olympics. Boutin would go on to win silver in the 1,000m race a few days later, earning a medal in all three individual distances.https://www.thestar.com/sports/olympics/2018/02/22/canadas-kim- boutin-takes-silver-in-womens-1000m-short-track-speedskating.html The Canadian team made the relay finals but after being tripped up by the Korean team and the chaos that followed the Canadian women finished off the Olympic relay podium for the first time ever.

The report was produced by the Foresight unit at the UK's Government Office of Science. It became known colloquially as 'The Foresight Report' among people working in the field of climate-linked migration. The report was led by Professor Richard Black of Sussex University. The report was one of the first assessments of all the existing evidence and research on the connections between climate change and migration. The report authors also commissioned a number of new peer reviewed articles on migration and climate change, significant adding to the evidence base of the topic. The report attracted significant media attention on its release. The report was critical of previous predictions of the number of people who could be forced to move by climate change. It argued that making such numerical predictions was impossible because attributing climate change as the sole cause of someone's migration was difficult. The report popularized the idea of trapped populations. The report argued that as well as being forced to move by climate change impacts, people might also be forced to stay where they are. The report drew on evidence showing that as people become poorer as a result of a degraded environment, they become less able to migrate. The idea of trapped populations had been present in the academic literature for sometime, however the media attention results from the release of the report brought the idea to a wider public for the first time. The report also popularized the idea of migration as climate change adaptation. Again, the authors drew on existing academic literature on the topic. They made the case that migration should be seen as a legitimate and empowering way for some people to adapt to the impacts of climate change.

He was born in New York City and died in St. George, Utah. Goldstein was a statistician, accountant, and attorney before becoming a photographer in 1970. Goldstein helped to popularize landscape photography of the national parks of the United States.  Early life  Milton started his law career in New York City. In 1949, Goldstein decided to transfer his law offices out West to Southern California. After working for 15 years in California, Milton began contemplating photography. His love for the mountains led to a few changes in his life, and he wanted to be near the mountain grandeur he loved. Because of its proximity to Yosemite National Park he wanted to move to Fresno first, but after he found out about fog and low visibility in winter, he cancelled his interest. His second decision was the Pacific Coast Highway, but he abandoned his plans for the same reasons. In 1976 he moved to Bishop, California, for a few years, but returned to Los Angeles from November 1979 to July 1981. His call of the mountains stayed. To be closer to nature and the mountains, but still able to work with his clients in Los Angeles, he moved to Westlake Village, northwest of Los Angeles. Milton Goldstein was born in New York City and died on May 17, 2000, in St. George, Utah. He started his career as an attorney and a certified public accountant before he moved to Utah and became a photographer. He was fascinated by the American West which led to the Smithsonian Institution exhibiting his dye transfer as a one-man show: The Magnificent West: An American Heritage. After the loss of his mother, he was left deeply disturbed and turned to the camera in his own personal attempt to create an ideal world of unknown mountain beauty. His wife, Martha, was a devoted editor and supporter to all of his practice.  Influences  Goldstein was a highly spiritual man. Although he was Jewish, he quoted from the New Testament quite frequently with his photos. Goldstein was an active member of a TV/radio show called Religion in Media (or RIM) where he was elected president from 1982-1983. He was known to give beautiful and poetic prayers on the show, from which he received many compliments and fan mail. Two of the books that Goldstein claimed most influential on his works were The Nature of Light and Colour in Open Air, by M. Minnaert, and Photographers on Photography, by Lyons. Goldstein was highly influenced by the words of Romantic poets (such as Keats and Wordsworth) because of their shared interest in Nature and the divine qualities that it has. Many Romantic poets worshipped Nature almost religiously. This idea resonated with Goldstein because of his spirituality. He used Nature as a supplement to his religious beliefs. Milton Goldstein had many different influences throughout his journey as a photographer as one read his collections you begin to pick up on just who influenced him the most. We see his style of writing which is very flowery and poetic of his love for nature just like the many quote he has above each of his manuscripts. Most of the people he would often quote were people such as William Shakespeare, Kahlil Gibran, and John Muir.  Photography career  Goldstein did not own a camera until 1964. He assumed that the field of photography was saturated, and there was no more work to be done. However, upon further realization, he discovered that only the surface of photography had been scratched. Inspired by the vast beauty of the American West, Goldstein began photographing in 1967. By 1971, he had closed his attorney and C.P.A. offices, and became a full-time photographer. One of the highlights of Goldstein's career was a traveling exhibition done in collaboration with the Smithsonian Institution entitled Magnificent West: American Heritage. The exhibition was highly successful and was displayed in more destinations for a longer amount of time than Smithsonian traveling exhibitions. The Magnificent West: American Heritage exhibition ran for four years, from July 1973 to May 1977, traveled to 26 states, and had 39 shows. This exhibition was well received by many museums and schools. Dennis A. Gould from the Smithsonian commented, > Milton Goldstein's photographs produced feelings that cannot be articulated. > Many should be able to view these works and be bathed in their light, marvel > over their subtleties, and be quieted by their magnificent grandeur. Robert A. Weinstein of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County said of Milton Goldstein's work, > In a time when the public presentation of visual images is near- > overwhelming, it is no mean feat to find new meanings in old subjects or add > even greater pleasure to oft-seen images. It is precisely here that > Goldstein brings to bear the awesome power of his vision. Within his work on the \\"Magnificent West\\" Milton produced several works focused on Zion National Park. Goldstein stressed that within his photos, transparency counted most. Accepting that the vast park could never fully be captured, he set out to capture glimpses of the park that did justice to its beauty. To aide his photographs he included quotes from several different writers, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, John Keats, Henry David Thoreau, John Muir, William Shakespeare, in order to help embody not only visually but spiritually the essence he tried to capture. Goldstein spent decades in and out of the park capturing the different seasons, finding that spring brought rich foliage color, summer dealt with vibrant light, fall focused on light and shadow, and winter focused on saturating light, finding that the light provided by the afternoon and sunset was undeniably when the park was most beautifully displayed. As he worked to capture several angles of different mountains, Goldstein was passionate about the beauty of Zion and his work. He expressed that it was \\"The Sentinel\\" in the light of a new sunrise one morning that permanently sealed his love for the park. As he spent a great deal of time in the park he was always patient with his photos, stressing the importance of capturing the park's true essence. A great example of this was his work with \\"Lady Mountain\\". Goldstein worked to capture the glory of this mountain and its \\"superb glowing tone\\", but he found that it took two full years from his first encounter with it to capture a photograph he felt did it justice. Even still, it was 23 years from his first encounter that he set out to, not only do it justice, but to create something that \\"yielded infinite pleasure\\". Milton stated that, after countless attempts, he gave up. Two days later snow fell, and on his last effort he managed to capture a photo of \\"lady mountain\\" that embodied everything he wanted from it. Goldstein strived to capture mountain portraits in all seasons, weather, and lighting. This way of photographing included a lot of observation and study of the mountains photographed. He stated that it takes a series of photographs to be a \\"complete portrait of a majestic mountain\\", but that it was still a \\"barely adequate introduction\\". Goldstein focuses on individual peaks instead of the vast mountain ranges. He shows that they all have something interesting and beautiful to be captured. He strived to illuminate or expose the beauty in nature to those that may overlook the grand simplistic wonder of these mountain forms. Goldstein said, \\"The greatest challenge, and most thrilling exhilaration, comes from reducing the artist's materials to a stark simplicity.\\" He wanted to bring the viewer to a new sense of appreciation. In one of his Zion compilations, Goldstein says, \\"To those who think that to have seen one mountain is to have seen them all, (as I heard an exhausted husband yell at a thrilled wife, in Yosemite), it may be difficult to realize that one can never completely see even one mountain. Even its basic form will be continually hanging, re-shaped by light and shadow, during the course of any day. In addition, changes in the viewpoint of the observer, the color and tones of light, and the moods of the sky, provide any mountain with so many faces that its appearance is always a fresh vision.\\" In his photography he exposes the wonders of God's creation as if to say \\"How can you not believe?\\" Goldstein often quotes the words of Romantic poets because of their shared interest in Nature. John Keats, William Wordsworth, John Muir, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Henry David Thoreau are some that are frequently quoted in his works.  National Park Service  On June 8, 1906, came the Lacey Antiquities Act, in which the President of the United States was authorized to reserve and establish sites and structures containing historic or scientific value to the nation. Congress officially authorized the National Park Service on August 24, 1916, but did not begin providing funding until April 17, 1917. Goldstein was featured in a full spread from Century City News in June 1978. It discusses his relationship with Horace Albright of the National Park Service: > Horace Alrbright secured and preserved millions of acres of national parks > and monuments so people could enjoy them; Milton Goldstein has captured and > preserved their beauty so people can understand and respect them.  Death and legacy  Many people wrote letters to Mr. Goldstein and his family, expressing appreciation for his work and commenting on his spiritual connection. A letter written by Leslee Scamahorn after his \\"Religion in Media\\" show on March 16, expressed just this.

After graduating from the Recording Engineering Program at the University of Miami, he spent some time working for New England Digital as a field service technician for the Synclavier, one of the first digital synthesizers / samplers / workstations, then on the road with Stevie Wonder (as a keyboard tech) and Michael Jackson (mixing live sound), before settling in LA. Having gotten into mixing a few years before the analog-to-digital revolution, Andrew worked with a collection of vintage gear at his Punkerpad West studio in Van Nuys, California, including a Neve Electronics BCM-10 with ten 1073s that were used for reference during the Waves Audio Scheps 73 plugin modeling process. Scheps is known for his balanced, modern sounding and often loud mixes.http://en.audiofanzine.com/sound-technique/editorial/articles/mixing-in- parallel-part-1.html In July 2015, while being interviewed on Pensado's Place,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zc1dJg3Uzs he declared to work completely \\"ITB\\" (in the box), which stands for working completely inside a computer, without the use of external gear. His 100% transition to ITB mixing occurred halfway through mixing the Hozier record in the summer of 2014. \\"Going back into the box wasn't a sonic decision, but I actually rediscovered that I really like it. It's great to be able to work on three or four songs at the same time. I have not gone back to working on the desk since then. While I miss some of the visceral hands-on aspects of the console, there is a lot of creative freedom working this way. It might seem like a drastic change, but it is only the tools that have changed: remarkably my philosophy and sound have stayed the same\\".https://mixwiththemasters.com/videos/master/297/andrew/scheps He is also the owner and president of Tonequake Records and Punker Pad West.

She is considered to be a popular representative of Mandinka culture and has released several records in local languages. Early life Bako Dagnon was born in the little village of Golobladji, around 20 kilometers away from Kita in a family of griots and n'goni players. The origins of her family can be traced back to the time of Sundiata Keita. In her birth village, she learned the songs from Ségou from her grandmother and those from Guinea from her mother, while her grandfather who had fought with Samori Ture taught her battlefields songs. When her mother died when Bako Dagnon was seven years old, her father gave her in the care of the childless wife of a griot in Kita. She was badly treated and left her adoption family later on to study the stories of the Mandinka Empire before its colonisation (the \\"tariku\\") with the grand Mandinka griot Kele Monson Diabate. Career =First success= In 1966, Bako Dagnon gave her first public concert in Kita during the local edition of the \\"Youth Week\\" (Semaine de la Jeunesse). This event had been created by the first president Modibo Keïta to \\"boost the cultural traditions of Mali\\". She performed a Fulani song in Bambara, Yirijanko Le, for which she won an award that allowed her to participate at the regional edition of the \\"Youth Week\\" of Kayes Region the following year. There she won again and performed at the national competition, the Bamako Biennale. Following these successes she performed regularly with the Regional Orchestra of Kita. In Bamako, she sang on weddings and gained popularity. =Work with the Ensemble Instrumental National= On demand of the Minister of Arts, Sports and Culture of the time, in 1974, Bako Dagnon joined Mali's National Instrumental Ensemble (Ensemble Instrumental National or EIN) which had been established shortly after the declaration of independence in 1961. The EIN was the most prestigious music ensemble in the country and consisted of about forty of the best Malian musicians. Although Bako Dagnon didn't live in Bamako but in Kita with her husband and children, she regularly performed with the EIN. She also joined the ensemble on a concert tour in Korea and China, where she played for Mao. Her performances led to an increase of her own reputation and of that of the ensemble. She gained notoriety in the whole of Mali with the song Tiga Monyonko (meaning \\"while pealing peanuts\\") which remains one of her most popular songs. = Career without the EIN = It was only in 1980 that the singer chose to move to Bamako with her children. After a serious road accident, Bako Dagnon decided to leave the National Instrumental Ensemble of Mali which at the time was also suffering from a lack of funding and the omnipresent government corruption. In 1990, she was offered a record deal by an Indian music producer from Liberia and registered her first cassette record. After the recording of a second cassette, the production company disappeared in the midst of the First Liberian Civil War. In the 1990s, Bako Dagnon continued giving public and private concerts. She did no recordings until the beginning of the 2000s when she also managed in gaining popularity outside of Mali. She participated on the albums Mandekalou (2004) and Mandekalou II (2006) of the Mandika griot collective of the same name of Ibrahima Sylla. She also appeared on the song Donso Ke on the album Electro Bamako (2006) by Marc Minelli. Her first international solo album, Titati, was again produced by Ibrahima Sylla and appeared on his label Syllart Records in 2007. François Bréant was the musical director. Sidiba, her seventh album, was released two years later. The song Le guide de la révolution was the only song in French and was released as a single. On 14 January 2009, Bako Dagnon was made a knight of the National Order of Mali. Death The singer died on 7 July 2015 at around six in the morning at the Hospital of Point-G in Bamako after a long illness. Her funeral was organised the following day in the neighbourhood Hamdallaye ACI 2000 where she had been living. It took place in the presence of numerous public figures, including members of the government and Keïta Aminata Maiga, the First Lady of Mali.

It has glaucous, sickle-shaped or curved, light green leaves, slender stem with 2 branches, and 3 violet, light blue violet, dark violet, and dark purple flowers. It was only found and described since 1973, and is not yet in general cultivation. It was once thought to be a form of Iris germanica, but has different morphological characteristics and different chromosomal differences. Description It is similar in form to Iris germanica, but it has more curved leaves (or sickle-shaped,) greener, and longer leaves, the stem is less glaucous,British Iris Society (1997) and it has less scarious (membranous) spathes. It has a thick rhizome, with many stoloniferous and fibrous branches. The rhizomes grow at ground level. It has herbaceous, (or deciduous), falcate (sickle-shaped), light green and slightly glaucous leaves. They can grow up to long. They often have 2–3 basal (rising from the rhizome) leaves, with one sheathing the stem. It has a flattened stem, or peduncle, that can grow up to between tall. It has 2 short branches, (or pedicels), the lowest branch is similar in length to the bract. The other branch, appears from the midpoint on the stem. The stem has 2–3 green, marked with purple, slightly inflated, rounded, spathes (leaves of the flower bud). They are scarious (along the top part of the leaf), at blooming time. The stem (and the branches) hold up to 3 flowers, in early season, in April, May, or between May and June. The slightly fragrant, flowers come in shades of violet, light blue violet, dark violet, and dark purple. It sometimes has bi-toned flowers. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The falls are obovate or cuneate (wedge shaped), and long and 4.5 cm wide. They have dark veining on the haft (near to the stem), They also sometimes curl under. In the centre, of the falls is a 'beard', or line of white hairs, tipped with yellow. The standards are elliptic shaped, with a narrow haft, and long and 3.8 cm wide. It has 3.8 cm long perianth tube, the style branch is normally, white with violet crest. The crest is toothed (dentate). It has white or blue filaments, and pale cream pollen. It has a triangular in section ovary. After the iris has flowered, it produces a seed capsule, which has not been described. =Biochemistry= In 2000, 11 iris species were studied and their leaf flavonoid, isoflavonoid and xanthone (chemical) constituents were analysed in order to investigate their phylogeny. Iris marsica is thought to have originated from Iris pseudopumila Tineo (chromosomal count of 2n= 16) x Iris variegata L. (2n = 24) but other possible parents are Iris pallida Lam., Iris cengialti Kern. (Terpin et al. 1996),Iris illyrica Tomm. (2n = 24) and Iris reichenbachii Heuff. (2n = 24). As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has a chromosome count: 2n=40, it was counted by Colasante & Sauer in 1993. The chromosomal count of 2n=40 is the same as Iris setina, Iris bicapitata, Iris lutescens, Iris relicta and Iris revoluta. Taxonomy It has the common name of 'Marsican iris'.Luciano Di Gregorio The Latin specific epithet marsica refers to Monti Marsicani (a mountain range) in Abruzzo, Italy. It was first published and described by Ignazio Ricci (1922–1986) and Maria Antonietta Colasante in 'Annali di botanica' Vol.32 page218, in 1973 (published in 1974), published in Rome, with 14 colour illustrations. It was later published in the 'Bulletin of the American Iris Society' Vol.292 on pages 82–85 in January 1994. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, then updated on 3 December 2004. It is listed in the Encyclopedia of Life. Iris marsica is an accepted name by the RHS. Distribution and habitat It is native to South-eastern Europe. =Range= It is endemic to Italy, within the regions of Umbria, Marche, Lazio, Molise and Abruzzo. It has geographic range of , which includes the Apennine Mountains, Monti Simbruini (with Iris sambucina (a synonym of Iris germanica L.) and Iris chameiris (a synonym of Iris lutescens Lam.)), and The Abruzzo National Park. It is listed in a checklist of Vascular Flora in Italy, with Iris albicans, Iris bicapitata, Iris foetidissima, Iris germanica, Iris marsica, Iris pallida, Iris planifolia, Iris pseudacorus, Iris pseudopumila, Iris relicta, Iris revoluta Iris setina, Iris sibirica and Iris xiphium. It is also listed as endemic species of the Apennines with Aquilegia magellensis, Centaurea scannensis, Jonopsidium savianum, Goniolimon italicum, Astragalus aquilanus and Achillea luncana.Franco Pedrotti =Habitat= It grows on the dry grasslands, mountain pastures, and scrub lands. Conservation Iris marsica has only been recorded from a limited number of locations, about 12 localities have a stable population. Most (10), are within the Abruzzo National Park. It is at risk of extinction, due to the threat of collection (from the wild). It is listed on the IUCN Red List of Plants of Italy, on both the national and regional sections, as 'lower risk (LR). It is now listed as a 'strictly protected' flora species.Council of Europe Staff It is protected by the EU Habitats Directive (Annex IV) and the Berne Convention (Annexe I) 1979.Council of Europe (Editors) 3 records are listed on Global Biodiversity Information Facility. In 2011, it was listed on the European Red List of Vascular Plants of the IUCN as 'Data Deficient' (DD). Cultivation It is hardy. It prefers situations in well-drained soils in full sun. It can be grown on slopes, and can be grown in similar situations as other bearded irises. It is not regularly available for sale, but only cultivated by iris collectors. Specimens can be seen in 'Michele Tenore Majella Botanical Garden', (also known as 'Giardino Botanico della Majella') situated within the scree slopes section of the garden. =Propagation= Irises can generally be propagated by division, or by seed growing. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), and if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Handling the plant may cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske References Sources * Mathew, B. 1981. The Iris. 31. * Tutin, T. G. et al., eds. 1964–1980.

A Democrat, she was the first woman to take the oath of office as state representative in January, 1925. She felt that the legislature should seek fewer, better laws, and introduced one bill in first term, providing increased state funding of bridges. She was a strong supporter of a bill to extend water mains in small towns, believing that this would be a great boon to women. She continued in the house and served five consecutive terms from 1925 to 1935 as representative of the seventh district. In 1937, she lost to Charles McLaughlin.\\"Mabel Gillespie Ran Good Race\\".

He is the founder and executive director of Adventure Scientists, a nonprofit organization that equips scientific partners with data collected from the outdoors that are crucial to addressing environmental and human health challenges. Gregg Treinish in Bozeman, MT, March 2020 Background Gregg was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio. He says he felt like an outsider as a child, unable to fit into friend groups and bristling in the confines of the classroom. At age 16, after years of struggling with school suspensions and self-doubt, he joined a backpacking and sea kayaking trip in British Columbia. That experience, and the empowerment he felt in the mountains, lifted him from despair. In 2004, Treinish thru-hiked the 2,174-mile Appalachian Trail. Several years later, he and filmmaker Deia Schlosberg spent 22 months trekking 7,800 miles along the spine of the Andes Mountains, for which National Geographic named them 2008 Adventurers of the Year. After returning from the Andes, Treinish worked as a wildlife biologist, studying species such as grizzly bears, lynx, owls and sturgeon. Combining his love of exploration and science, he led and participated in expeditions tracking wolverines in Mongolia, testing animal migration corridors in the northern Rockies, and documenting wildlife in the Okavango Delta in Botswana. Treinish became increasingly cognizant that many outdoor adventurers like him benefited so much from nature that they felt compelled to give back. in 2011, he founded Adventure Scientists, which mobilizes outdoor enthusiasts to use their unique skills to collect scientific data from difficult-to-access locations and across vast areas of the globe. The nonprofit recruits, trains and manages these volunteer adventurers to collect high quality data that enable scientists to advance conservation and human health. He earned a bachelor's degree in sociology at University of Colorado Boulder in 2002, and a second bachelor's degree, in biology, from Montana State University in 2009. He continues to live in Bozeman, Montana, where he and his wife are raising their two children.

She is known for being the first American woman scientist to live and work in the interior of the Antarctic, where she developed new methods to analyze the deep glacial ice by studying the effect it has on radio waves. Early life and education Born in 1925 in Topeka, Kansas, Irene was the oldest of three girls, her mother was also the oldest child of four, in a Swedish immigrant family. Her mother was a school teacher in math and music education. Her father was in the automobile business. She graduated from Central High School in Kansas City, Missouri. After graduating from Kansas City Junior College, Irene went on to graduate from the University of Colorado with a degree in electrical engineering in 1947. She later went to graduate school at Stanford University, where she conducted research for her doctoral dissertation in the Stanford Microwave Lab. In 1962, Irene became the first woman to earn a PhD in engineering from Stanford. Both Peden's M.S and Ph.D from Stanford were in electrical engineering. Professional career After graduating from the University of Colorado from 1947 to 1949, Irene worked as a junior engineer for Delaware Power and Light Company, and then for Aircraft Radio systems Laboratory of the Stanford Research Institute from 1949 to 1950. From 1953 to 1954, she worked as a research engineer for Midwest Research Institute. Once she earned her doctorate degree, Irene joined the electrical engineering faculty at the University of Washington, first as an assistant to associate professor from 1961 to 1971, and then promoted to full professor in 1971. Later, she was an associate dean of engineering from 1973 to 1977, and then the associate chair of the electrical engineering department from 1983 to 1986. Peden became the Professor Emerita of electrical engineering at the University of Washington in 2002. Peden has also had her hand in several scientific publications, either writing alone or with others. Some of her works include: \\"Radio Science\\", \\"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation\\", \\"Transactions on Geoscience Electronics\\". = Work in the Antarctic = In 1970, Irene became the first American woman engineer or scientist to conduct research in the Antarctic interior.Kristen Pope, \\"Trailblazing Engineer Irene Peden Broke Antarctic Barriers for Women,\\" Smithsonian, June 7, 2019 While there, she conducted research with a grant from the Polar Upper Atmosphere Program at the National Science Foundation. Her work during her time in the Antarctic consisted of characterizing glacial ice. They often worked 12-hour days in temperatures as low as -50°C. She and her students were the first to measure many important electrical properties of the glacial ice. Paths in the ice were measured using very low frequency propagation. Structures and other items were found under the ice using very high frequency radio waves. Peden designed the mathematical models and methodology needed to find this characteristics. In 1979 she spent an entire winter at the South Pole, becoming the first woman to do so.Karina Peggau, \\"Overcoming Ice and Stereotypes at the Bottom of the World,\\" Eos, September 5, 2019. Because of the significance of her work, the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) named a line of cliffs near Rhodes Icefall after her scientific contributions, now called Peden Cliffs ().  Memberships  Irene Peden is a member of several scientific organizations. Some of these are the Explorer's Club, the ASEE, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, the New York Academy of Sciences, and the American Geophysical Union. Other organizations she is a member of include International Union of Radio Science (URSI), the Society of Women Engineers, National Academy of Engineering, and the Association of Women in Science. She is also an alum of several academic honor societies. These include Tau Beta Pi, Sigma Xi, and Mortar Board. Awards and honors This might sound very minor but the author of one of only a tiny number of 'career novels' mentioning that engineering could also be for girls, noted her special thanks to Peden in 1966, presumably for helping with the background reality for young women entering the male-majority profession. Peden received the Society of Women Engineers' Achievement Award in 1973 as well as the U.S. Army's Outstanding Civilian Service Medal in 1987 for her research and work in the Antarctic. Irene Peden was elected member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1993 for her leadership in engineering education in antennas and propagation and contributions to radioscience in the polar region. Also that same year, the National Science Foundation named her as the Engineer of the Year. Among her other numerous awards she was inducted into the ASEE Engineering Educators Hall of Fame. She is also a Fellow of IEEE, which honored her with their Distinguished Achievement Award, the Centennial Medal in 1984, and Third Millennium Medal for 2000. Irene Peden received the Diamond Award from the University of Washington in 2018 which is given to alumni and others who have made great strides in the field of engineering.

The Brothers Grimm published it in 1812 in the first edition of their collection Grimms' Fairy Tales. It was titled in (in modern orthography Schneewittchen) and numbered as Tale 53. The Grimms completed their final revision of the story in 1854.Jacob Grimm & Wilhelm Grimm: Kinder- und Hausmärchen; Band 1, 7. Ausgabe (children's and households fairy tales, volume 1, 7th edition). Dietrich, Göttingen 1857, page 264–273. It has generally been regarded as purely a tale of fiction; however, recent research suggests that the story may have been inspired from a real story. Theories Folklorist Joseph Jacobs, in Europa's Fairy Book, in his commentaries, points out that the story of Snow White seems to combine motifs from several tales.Jacobs, Joseph. Europa's Fairy Book. London: G. Putnam and Sons. 1916. pp. 260-261. =Chione= Scholar Graham Anderson compares the story of Snow White to the Roman legend of Chione, recorded in Ovid's Metamorphoses. The name Chione means \\"Snow\\" in Greek and, in the story, she is described as the most beautiful woman in the land, so beautiful that the gods Apollo and Mercury both fell in love with her. Mercury put her to sleep with the touch of his caduceus and raped her in her sleep. Then Apollo, disguised as an old crone, approached her and raped her again. These affections led Chione to openly boast that she was more beautiful than the goddess Diana herself, resulting in Diana shooting her through the tongue with an arrow.Ovid, Metamorphoses, Book XI, 289 =Margaretha von Waldeck= In 1994, the German historian Eckhard Sander published Schneewittchen: Märchen oder Wahrheit? (Snow White: Fairy Tale or True Story?), claiming he had uncovered an account that may have inspired the story that first appeared in Grimm’s Fairy Tales. According to Sander, the character of Snow White was based on the life of Margaretha von Waldeck, daughter of Philip IV, Count of Waldeck- Wildungen (1493–1574) and his first wife, Margaret Cirksena (1500–1537), daughter of Edzard I, Count of East Frisia. According to Bad Wildungen city documents, she was famous for her beauty.Dekker, p. 33 Since 1539, she had a very strict stepmother, Katharina von Hatzfeld (1510–1546), and perhaps soon after, Margaretha was raised at nearby Weilburg at the court of Philip III, Count of Nassau-Weilburg. In 1545, she traveled through the Siebengebirge (\\"seven hills\\") to live with her mother's brother Johann Cirksena (1506-1572) at Valkenburg Castle, in present day Limburg, Netherlands.Dekker, pp. 31-32 In 1549, her father sent her on to the Brussels court of Mary of Hungary, governor of the Habsburg Netherlands and sister of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. Margaretha's presence at the court was partially meant to improve the relationship of her father with the emperor and help the release of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, who had been imprisoned in Brussels for his role in the Schmalkaldic War. The situation at the court was complicated, as several high ranking personalities were striving for Margaretha, including Lamoral, Count of Egmont. Charles V's son, Crown Prince Philip, arrived at his aunt's court in 1549. Tradition has it that he pursued Margaretha during the few months he was there, as well, though no official relationship could occur, as she was Lutheran.Dekker, p. 35 Three surviving letters from Margaretha to her father show that her health declined steadily over the next few years and she died at the age of 21 in March 1554.Dekker, p. 40 In Waldeck chronicles, she was suggested to have been poisoned. Since, however, her father's second wife died in 1546 and he only remarried again in October 1554, her stepmother never was a suspect in the alleged poisoning case. Margaretha's father owned several copper mines; a majority of workers were children, and Sander suggested that the legendary reference to the seven dwarfs is related to child labor in the mine. The residence of the seven dwarfs has been suggested to be the former copper-mining village Bergfreiheit, now a district of Bad Wildungen that calls itself Schneewittchendorf (Snow White village). Like the fairy tale's dwarfs, the child laborers there used to live in groups of about 20 in a single room house. =Maria Sophia von Erthal= According to a study group in Lohr, Bavaria, Snow White is based on Maria Sophia von Erthal, born on 15 June 1729 in Lohr am Main, Bavaria. She was the daughter of 18th-century landowner, Prince Philipp Christoph von Erthal and his wife, Baroness von Bettendorff. After the death of the Baroness, Prince Philipp went on to marry Claudia Elisabeth Maria von Venningen, Countess of Reichenstein, who was said to dislike her stepchildren. The castle where they lived, now a museum, was home to a mirror that was famous for its extremely smooth and even surface, something uncommon in that period. It was referred to as ‘talking mirror’, because “it always spoke the truth” (now housed in the Spessart Museum). The mirror, constructed in 1720 by the Mirror Manufacture of the Electorate of Mainz in Lohr, had been in the house during the time that Maria’s stepmother lived there. Her gravestone was found in 2019.https://www.foxnews.com/science/snow-white-gravestone-surfaces The dwarfs in Maria’s story are also linked to a mining town, Bieber, located just west of Lohr and set among seven mountains. The smallest tunnels could only be accessed by very short miners, who often wore bright hoods, as the dwarfs have frequently been depicted over the years. The Lohr study group maintains that the glass coffin may be linked to the region’s famous glassworks, while the poisoned apple may be associated with the deadly nightshade poison that grows in abundance in Lohr.

It is represented by a single species, Thalassocalyce inconstans, which is the only species in the family Thalassocalycidae and the order Thalassocalycida.Madin, L. P., and G. R. Harbison. \\"Thalassocalyce inconstans, new genus and species, an enigmatic ctenophore representing a new family and order.\\" Bulletin of Marine Science 28.4 (1978): 680-687. T. inconstans is a pelagic ctenophore typically occurring in upper-mesopelagic depths, but has been observed at depths up to 3,500 m in Monterey Canyon.Swift, H. F., Hamner, W. M., Robison, B. H., & Madin, L. P. (2009). Feeding behavior of the ctenophore Thalassocalyce inconstans: revision of anatomy of the order Thalassocalycida. Marine biology, 156(5), 1049-1056. Due to their fragility, gelatinous zooplankton are inherently difficult to sample by traditional methods (i.e. net tows),Harbison, G. R., Madin, L. P., & Swanberg, N. R. (1978). On the natural history and distribution of oceanic ctenophores. Deep-Sea Research, 25(3), 233-256. and among ctenophorans Thalassocalyce inconstans is especially fragile having thin, flaccid tissues, likely contributing to broad under- sampling. The individual collection of undamaged specimens via scuba and novel instrumentation (e.g. Remotely Operated Vehicles, submersibles, and imaging systems) has allowed for more robust investigation of T. inconstans.Luo, Jessica Y., Benjamin Grassian, Dorothy Tang, Jean-Olivier Irisson, Adam T. Greer, Cedric M. Guigand, Sam McClatchie, and Robert K. Cowen. (2014) Environmental drivers of the fine-scale distribution of a gelatinous zooplankton community across a mesoscale front. Marine Ecology Progress Series 510: 129-149.  Morphology  Thalassocalycid morphology is unique within the Ctenophora, sharing certain similarities to both cydippid (i.e. canal structure) and lobates, and characterized by absence of auricles and muscular lobes. Rather, unmuscular lobes are fused into a continuous dome forming a medusa-like body plan. While morphologically and structurally distinct from the oral lobes of lobate ctenophores, the thin thalassocalycid bell is functionally analogous as mechanism for prey-capture. When fully expanded, the body forms a hemispherical bell, but a bi-radial (“two-globe”) morphology is apparent when the organisms is partially contracted. The function of fully developed tentacles that do not extend outside of the “bell” has not been resolved. Several lobate ctenophores, (e.g. Leucothea multicornis) pass through larval stages that are ‘mudisoform,’ but the retention of a medusoid- like bauplan in adults is unique to Thalassocalyce inconstans. Initial description of this species overturned suggestions that T. inconstans was a larval form of species already described. Auricle-free ctenophorans are known from the deep-sea, but these species have not yet been described due to sampling obstacles.  Foraging  Thalassocalyce inconstans is a predatory ctenophore that feeds on euphasiid krill and small crustaceans. A passive foraging mechanism is employed, whereby T. inconstans ‘fishes’ for prey with its bell expanded. Prey that come into contact with foraging (bell-expanded) T. inconstans stimulate the rapid contraction of the bell, and are trapped within a mucus-covered inner surface.

George was a twentieth century American collector of Native American artifacts.  Collector  He amassed a large collection of Native American artifacts from St. Joseph, Missouri between 1904 and 1923. This notable collection includes over 4,000 objects, hundreds of photographs, books and two large ledgers filled with correspondence surrounding the collection. The collection is owned by St. Joseph Museums, Inc. In 1904, Harry George purchased his first basket on a trip west and by 1914 the Kansas City Star wrote he had \\"assembled one of the finest collections [of Native American artifacts] in existence\\". George corresponded with George Gustav Heye, Francis La Fleshe, Grace Nicholson, Luther Standing Bear, and many other notable collectors and dealers in Native American artifacts in the early 1900s. His correspondence includes letters from reservation agents and lesser known collectors yet to be significantly researched.  Personal life  George was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in November, 1849. He moved to St. Joseph, Missouri, in September, 1869, and entered the employ of R. L. McDonald & Co., with whom he continued for twenty-seven years. On January 23, 1884, he married his employer's daughter Maggie Beattie McDonald. They had two daughters. The St. Joseph businessman and textile broker died in 1923, leaving his collection to his heirs. His hope was to create a museum for St. Joseph and he had worked towards raising $25,000 for that purpose. In 1924, the collection was loaned to the State Museum in Jefferson City, Mo. It returned to St. Joseph in 1944 on loan and was purchased by the St. Joseph Museum in 1947.

Story  In the African jungle, in ancient times, Ribo-a-Irep, the daughter of Irep, is a teenager girl living in a village of gatherers. She was promised to Dik- a-Gan, the son of Gan, chief of the neighboring village of dancers, while still inside her mother's belly. While the betrothed await their upcoming marriage, Teter-a-Mum, chief of a third village, a village of warriors, wants to make Ribo his new wife, one who would finally give him a child.

They made up about 80% of the ridership of the city buses in the early 1950s but, under Jim Crow rules, black people were forced to sit in the back of the bus, even when the front of the bus was empty. State laws prohibited black citizens from owning private buses outside the city systems. Background Activists proposed to the city that black riders would be allowed to ride in the front of the bus, but voluntarily refrain from sitting next to whites. The City Council initially approved this concept and passed Ordinance 222. But the cadre of all-white bus drivers refused to enforce the ordinance, and they went on strike. The ordinance was overturned after the strike went on four days. The drivers returned to work after the Louisiana Attorney General overturned the ordinance and declared victory. Rev. T. J. Jemison helped organize the United Defense League and a bus boycott after the integration ordinance was overturned. Black residents met in four mass meetings and raised $6,000 for the boycott in just two days. About 14,000 residents refused to board the city's buses and instead accepted rides in free taxis set up by the community and in private car pools. About 125 private cars were used to transport people while the boycott was in force. After six days, the boycott ended when the city passed Ordinance 251. It directed that black riders would fill the bus from the rear forward and whites from the front toward the back. Blacks and whites were prohibited from sitting next to each other in the same row. Two front seats were declared off-limits to black riders, and only black riders could occupy the wide rear seat that spanned the back of the bus. The boycott had an economic impact on the city's transportation system and on the broader Civil Rights Movement. Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. became aware of the bus boycott and spoke with Rev. Jemison about the fight for social justice in Baton Rouge. He especially wanted to discuss the free car ride system, which was a key part of enforcing the Baton Rouge bus boycott. The 1953 Baton Rouge Bus boycott served as a model for the internationally known 1955 Montgomery bus boycott. The 1953 Baton Rouge Bus boycott also inspired residents to mobilize around other issues, such as securing the right to vote. In recognition of the importance of the 1953 Baton Rouge Bus Boycott in African-American history and world history, the Toni Morrison Society's \\"Bench by the Road\\" project selected Baton Rouge as a site to memorialize. The project places benches at sites with historical significance for people of African ancestry. The permanent site of the bench commemorating the bus boycott is the McKinley High School Alumni Center. Further reading *Beauchamp, M. (2008). Baton Rouge Bus Boycott. ABC-CLIO, LLC. *Joiner, L. L.

Marriage and death  Emibai Jinnah was born in 1878 in Paneli Moti, a village in Rajkot district of Gujarat, during the time of British India. When she was 14 years of age, Muhammad Ali Jinnah's mother Mithibai Jinnah was urging him to marry his cousin Emibai. Jinnah complied with his mother's wishes and married Emibai at Paneli Village. Shortly after the wedding, Muhammad Ali Jinnah left for England to engage in higher academic studies, and a few months later Emibai died.

The painting shows a toast at a wedding feast following a boyar marriage, where the bride and the groom are expected to kiss each other. The bride looks sad and reluctant, while the elderly attendant standing behind her encourages the bride to kiss the groom. The work won a gold medal at the World's Fair held in Antwerp, Belgium in 1885, and is considered to be one of Makovsky's most popular works. Background Konstantin Makovsky was a Russian realist painter who opposed academic restrictions. His paintings venerate Russia's old world customs. A Boyar Wedding Feast is painted as a scene from the seventeenth-century – depicting the old way of Russian life, bringing back memories of the cherished past. Painting A Boyar Wedding Feast is an oil on canvas painting measuring , set in either the 16th or 17th century, in which a room of guests are depicted toasting a newlywed couple. A traditionally offered boyar wedding toast is meant to encourage the first kiss to make the wine sweeter. The couple stands at the head of the table (right), where the groom presents his bride to the wedding guests and sees her without her veil for the first time. She appears timid and bashful as the men toast for the first kiss. To the right of the couple, the \\"Lady of Ceremony\\" gently urges on the bride. Detail: the roasted swan on a large platter Makovsky's depiction of the wedding, an important social event of 16th and 17th century boyar life, is dramatically lit. The guests are depicted at the table with food and drink served on silverware in front of them. A roasted swan is being brought in on a large platter, the last dish served before the couple retire into the bedroom. Luxurious details such as silver cups, richly embroidered garments, and an ivory chest with a silver bowl in the foreground are depicted. The bride and the other women are wearing pearl-studded kokoshniki, a Russian woman's headdress. Provenance Winning the 1885 medal of honor at the Exposition Universelle d'Anvers (2 May – 2 November 1885), A Boyar Wedding Feast was purchased by American jeweler and art collector Charles William Schumann in August 1885 for $15,000 (or £10,000). Schumann reportedly outbid Alexander III of Russia to obtain the work. The painting was auctioned as part of Schumann's estate on 23 January 1936 and sold for $2,500. Sometime after the sale, A Boyar Wedding Feast entered the collection of Robert Ripley, creator of Ripley's Believe It or Not!. It was sold during his estate sale on 26 August 1949 for $2,200. The painting was again offered for sale on 18 December 1968. Between 1968 and 1973, the painting was acquired by Marjorie Merriweather Post. Upon her death in 1973, the Hillwood Estate, Museum & Gardens was founded by Post's estate, and A Boyar Wedding Feast was donated to the collection.

The film is a remake of the 2011 South Korean film Blind, also by the same director. It was released in China on October 30, 2015. Plot Lu Xiaoxing is a rookie cop when one night, she abandons her post to find her brother and aspiring singer an bring him back home after his constant rebellion. As they fight in the car, Xiaoxing loses control of the vehicle and crashes into a truck, killing her brother and leaving her blind. Three years later, Xiaoxing is living life as a blind woman. Amidst a string of female disappearances in the city, she tries unsuccessfully to persuade her former police academy senior to allow her another chance at being an officer. Upset and unable to come to terms with the rejection and her brother's death, Xiaoxing calls a taxi to head home. After waiting for a while, a luxurious car pulls up and asks her if she needs a taxi. Upon getting in, she immediately realizes strange things about the car and her driver offers her a coffee. As they fight over opening the coffee, they crash into a woman. In the middle of chaos, Xiaoxing is left in the rain as he drives off. At the police station, she reports her experience to the head of police, Captain Lu and with her police training, is able to deduce key details of the incident despite being blind. After a hefty reward is posted for any eyewitnesses, it attracts the attention of reckless, music-loving teenager Linchong. Xiaoxing and Captain Lu both dismiss his account. One night, when Linchong rollerblades home after Xiaoxing and Captain Lu claim that they will be late, he is tailed by Tang Zhen on a motorcycle. After temporarily escaping, he is knocked over by Tang Zhen’s car and admitted to the hospital, and was lucky to be alive with no severe damage to his skull and brain. However, a few days later, Linchong sees a man tailing Xiaoxing as she boards a bus. Sensing danger, Linchong calls Xiaoxing and asks her to turn on her video camera to film her surroundings so he can guide her to safety. Her pursuer notices and gives chase, but she manages to escape. However, her guide dog, Cong-Cong is killed in the melee. The search now begins as the police unit notice that all the missing women had disappeared after being set up for a date on the \\"Let's Meet\\" dating app. Linchong notices the male usernames are all lyrics from the same song and guesses the next username will be the song's next line. They trace the owner of the account to Tang Zhen, a plastic surgeon and the culprit, who began kidnapping women using the dating app after he accidentally killed his own sister in a confrontation about her online dating in an effort to remake them into his late sister's image. Xiaoxing brings Linchong to her old home, and she reveals that she is the older sister of the dead singer Linchong greatly admires. Tang Zhen traces Xiaoxing to her home and he fanatically offers to kill the both of them together, since they are so similar to the other, both having loved and lost a sibling. However, Linchong appears and temporarily subdues Tang Zhen. Xiaoxing sets the room on fire before escaping the house. In a fury and half burnt, Tang Zhen chases after her, but Linchong swings a violin at him and incapacitates him before the police arrive. A year later, Xiaoxing watches Linchong performing her brother's song onstage.

She was a prolific author on the topic of food preservation. To facilitate her investigations, as the Annual Report of the Librarian of Congress (1940) states, she collected \\"materials on the sources, preparation, and consumption of foods, their chemistry, baterriology, preservations, etc., from earliest times to the present day.\\" She and her husband, Arvril Bitting, donated a significant collection of materials related to cookery to the Library of Congress. The Bitting Collection containing numerous English and American publications on food preparation from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and a sampling of notable French, German, and Italian works. Many modern food safety practices and techniques result directly from research conducted by the couple. Personal life Katherine Bitting was born April 29, 1869, in Stratford, Ontario, Canada. Her family immigrated to Massachusetts in the United States when she was young. She married Arvill Wayne Bitting, a professor of veterinary science, cookery expert and author of several cookbooks. Katherine and Arvill Wayne Bitting formed a close partnership, working at the same institutions and collaborating on several publications. Education and early career Bitting graduated from the Salem Normal School, now Salem State University, in 1886. From Purdue University, she earned a Bachelor of Science degree in 1890, a Masters of Science in 1892, and a Doctor of Science in 1895. Bitting was an assistant botanist with the Purdue Agricultural Extension Station while completing her masters thesis. In 1893 she started working as an instructor at Purdue, teaching biology, structural botany, and bacteriology.  Career  In September 1907 Bitting was appointed as a microanalyst in the chemistry division of the US Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Chemistry, where she worked with Avril Bitting and gained expertise on food preservation and related topics, authoring nearly fifty pamphlets in that subject area. During her time at the Bureau of Chemistry, Katherine worked as a microbotanist. Her first job involved working with her husband to develop a method of producing ketchup without adding preservatives. To answer this question, the Bittings turned their Lafayette home into a ketchup factory, producing hundreds of bottles of the condiment. They collected ketchup samples from dozens of factories for analysis. Observing the samples and performing spoilage experiments, they determined that the addition of sugar and vinegar will prevent spoiling. Arvill Bitting published their findings under the title Experiments on the Spoilage of Tomato Ketchup in 1909. In 1915 two additional monographs were published. Ketchup Methods of Manufacturer and Microscopic. In the 1920s, the Bittings began working for the National Canners Association as microanalists. They published Appertizing or, The Art of Canning in 1937. The apparent mis-spelling is a reference to Nicolas Appert, the French inventor of airtight food preservation. =Employment timeline= * 1890-1893: Assistant Botanist, Indiana Experiment Station. * 1893-1901: Biology instructor, Purdue University. * 1901-1904: Assistant professor of biology, Purdue University. * 1907-1913: Microanalyst, Bureau of Chemistry, United States Department of Agriculture. * 1913-1918: Technician, National Canners Association research laboratory in Washington D.C. * 1919-1923: Bacteriologist, Glass Container Association.

It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include constipation, low blood magnesium, and abdominal pain. It works by binding potassium in the gut. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 2015. Medical uses Patiromer is used for the treatment of hyperkalemia, but not as an emergency treatment for life-threatening hyperkalemia, as it acts relatively slowly. Such a condition needs other kinds of treatment, for example calcium infusions, insulin plus glucose infusions, salbutamol inhalation, and hemodialysis. Typical reasons for hyperkalemia are chronic kidney disease and application of drugs that inhibit the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) – e.g. ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, or potassium-sparing diuretics – or that interfere with renal function in general, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Adverse effects Patiromer was generally well tolerated in studies. Side effects that occurred in more than 2% of patients included in clinical trials were mainly gastro-intestinal problems such as constipation, diarrhea, nausea, and flatulence, and also hypomagnesemia (low levels of magnesium in the blood) in 5% of patients, because patiromer binds magnesium in the gut as well.  Interactions  Patiromer was tested for drug-drug interactions with 28 drugs and showed binding or interaction with 14 of these drugs. This could reduce their availability and thus effectiveness, wherefore patiromer has received a boxed warning by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), telling patients to wait for at least six hours between taking patiromer and any other oral drugs. Of the 14 drugs that did show an interaction in vitro, 12 were selected for further testing in phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers to assess whether the results seen in vitro translated into an effect in people. These studies showed patiromer did not alter the absorption of nine of the 12 drugs when co-administered. Patiromer reduced absorption of three drugs when co-administered, however, there was no interaction when patiromer and these three drugs were taken 3 hours apart. This information was submitted to the FDA in the form of a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) and as a result, in November 2016 the FDA approved the removal of the boxed warning regarding the separation of patiromer and other oral medications. The updated label recommends patients take patiromer at least three hours before or three hours after other oral medications. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= Patiromer works by binding free potassium ions in the gastrointestinal tract and releasing calcium ions for exchange, thus lowering the amount of potassium available for absorption into the bloodstream and increasing the amount that is excreted via the feces. The net effect is a reduction of potassium levels in the blood serum. Lowering of potassium levels is detectable 7 hours after administration. Levels continue to decrease for at least 48 hours if treatment is continued, and remain stable for 24 hours after administration of the last dose. After this, potassium levels start to rise again over a period of at least four days. =Pharmacokinetics= Patiromer is not absorbed from the gut, is not metabolized, and is excreted in unchanged form with the feces. Chemistry The substance is a cross-linked polymer of 2-fluoroacrylic acid with divinylbenzenes and 1,7-octadiene. It is used in form of its calcium salt (ratio 2:1) and with sorbitol (one molecule per two calcium ions or four fluoroacrylic acid units), a combination called patiromer sorbitex calcium. File:2-Fluoroacrylic acid.svg2-fluoroacrylic acid File:Divinylbenzene12.PNGo-divinylbenzene File:Divinylbenzene14.PNGp-divinylbenzene File:1,7-Octadiene.svg1,7-octadiene Patiromer sorbitex calcium is an off- white to light brown, amorphous, free-flowing powder. It is insoluble in water, 0.1 M hydrochloric acid, heptane, and methanol. History =Studies= In a Phase III multicenter clinical trial including 237 patients with hyperkalemia under RAAS inhibitor treatment, 76% of participants reached normal serum potassium levels within four weeks.

She was a union organizer, social worker and health care advocate, who participated in the Alcatraz occupation, providing support at the health clinic established on the island. She spent 40 years researching social issues and providing social services to Native Americans, children, prisoners, and mental health patients in California and was posthumously inducted into the California Social Work Hall of Distinction in 2004. Biography Dorothy Lonewolf Miller, who was part Blackfoot, was born in 1920 in West Liberty, Iowa. At the age of 19, she was part of the Iowa Writers' Workshop and began publishing poems in anthologies. Around the same time, she began working in factories in Iowa as a union organizer, starting a lifelong career of activism. Miller enrolled in the University of Iowa earning a bachelor's degree in 1955 in sociology. She continued her studies there, obtaining a master's degree in Social Work in 1957. In the 1960s, she moved to California and became a part of the national deinstitutionalization movement, advocating for mental health patients to be treated from home rather than institutionalized. She worked and researched at the California Department of Mental Hygiene and contributed to the legislative reforms of the state hospital systems. In 1966, Miller left public service to found a non-profit research firm, Scientific Analysis Corporation, of San Francisco. Among the social policies she researched were alcoholism's effect on children, mental health, prison reform, runaways and urban American Indians. In 1967, Miller completed her PhD in Social Welfare at UC Berkeley and in 1968 her research was used to help pass the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act. That same year, she founded and became director of the Institute for Scientific Analysis (ISA). When Native Americans began the occupation of Alcatraz Island, Miller worked with Stella Leach, an LPN who was the primary organizer, and Jenny Joe, along with volunteer doctors to provide health services at a clinic established on the island in one of the buildings. She also wrote poems about the event to help publicize it and preserve the memory of the occupation for posterity, in nearly a dozen verses written during the occupation. Miller also sat up an \\"Indian Desk\\" at her company to channel money and communications to the occupiers, manning both the Indians of All Tribes bank account and radio services between Alcatraz and the mainland. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Miller conducted research and published her findings on social services and welfare. Many of her studies were state- or federally-funded programs which launched initiatives and organizations for improving education and services to various sectors of society. She continued serving as director of the ISA until her retirement in 2000. She donated 400 books on Native Americans to the Soboba Band of Luiseno Indians in San Jacinto, California shortly before her death to enable to tribe to establish a library. In her honor, they created the Lonewolf Reading Room and established the Cham-Mix Poki (House of our Culture) to house the collection. Miller died on May 30, 2003, and in 2004 was posthumously inducted into the California Social Work Hall of Distinction.

Niamh was introduced as a General practitioner at The Mill. She first appeared on 1 May 2014, and made her last appearance on 1 April 2016. Development The character was introduced in May 2014, as a replacement for Jas Khella (Vineeta Rishi). A writer for Inside Soap described Niamh as \\"bubbly\\" and a \\"sunny motormouth\\". Regan thought that Niamh was flawed, but \\"very well-meaning and sincere, with a really good heart\\". She also called Niamh an incompetent doctor. Producers established a romantic relationship between Niamh and Al Haskey (Ian Midlane). The pair get off to a bad start, as Al is \\"miffed\\" when his favourite candidate does not get the job, and he talks down to Niamh. However, when he helps her out with a diagnosis, she kisses him on the cheek to thank him, forcing Al to reconsider his feelings towards her. In November 2014, series producer Peter Lloyd promised more to come from Al and Niamh, saying \\"There was an immediate chemistry between Al and Niamh – but the trouble is that they don't quite know each other as well as they think they do. That will catch them out after Christmas.\\" On 20 March 2016, Regan announced via her social media that she was leaving Doctors after two years in the role. She explained that it was her decision to leave and praised the writers for her character's exit storyline. Her final scenes aired on 1 April. The storyline sees Niamh helping her love interest Ben Owens (James Daffern) take his critically ill son Harry Owens (Cuchulainn Canning) to Switzerland for surgery. Upon her return, practice manager Anthony Harker (Adam Astill) fires her and Niamh decides to move back to Ireland, following \\"a final farewell\\" with Al. Storylines Her early storylines include moving in with Emma Reid (Dido Miles) and Ayesha Lee (Laura Rollins), and dealing with the fact that she couldn't save a patient dying. Niamh's final storyline was illegally smuggling her lover's son to Switzerland for life-saving treatment against his mother's will. After being fired, Niamh heads off in a taxi to the airport en route to Ireland after sharing a heartfelt goodbye with Al. Reception For her portrayal of Niamh, Regan won Best Newcomer at the 2015 British Soap Awards. Regan's win marked the first time Doctors had won an award at the event in six years. Of her win, Regan commented, \\"I really was in complete shock, I wasn't pretending. I'm not that good an actress! I was delighted, especially as Doctors hadn't won for so long.\\" Speaking to Digital Spy about the result, Lorna Laidlaw who plays Mrs Tembe commented: \\"We were all ecstatic. Beforehand we were like, 'It's ridiculous, what's the point of us turning up here every year?!' So it was time – it always is time.\\" Regan was also nominated for Best Actress and Best On-Screen Partnership with Midlane. Regan received \\"quite a lot of flak\\" from fans when Niamh and Al's relationship ended. She said, \\"I was shouted at on a plane, with someone telling me not to be such a B-word to Al.

All 101 passengers and crew evacuated the aircraft and survived, but twenty-two of them were injured. Accident Flight 2D405 caught fire while taxiing for departure at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. The aircraft was leaking fuel shortly before it caught fire, according to the pilots of an aircraft that was following Flight 405. All passengers and crew evacuated the aircraft. Fifteen were taken to a local hospital to be treated for injuries. The airport's two runways were closed. The south runway reopened around 3:20 PM. Dynamic Airways continue to operate Flight 405 on the Fort Lauderdale - Caracas route. Aircraft The aircraft involved in the incident (c/n 23280) was a Boeing 767-269ER with registration N251MY. The 131st Boeing 767 built, it first flew on January 30, 1986 and was delivered to Kuwait Airways approximately seven weeks later. While owned by Kuwait Airways, the airframe was leased at times to EgyptAir, Qatar Airways and Polynesian Airlines. In 1995, Kuwait Airways sold the airframe to Birgenair, which subsequently leased the airframe to Alas Nacionales and LAN Airlines. Following the collapse of Birgenair shortly after the crash of Birgenair Flight 301, Air Gabon acquired the airframe for two years until its acquisition by First Security Corporation (now part of Wells Fargo) in 1999. The plane was then stored for the next five years out of service until United Arab Emirates-based Phoenix Aviation (later AVE.com) purchased the frame from Wells Fargo in 2004, leasing it to Kam Air in early 2004. Current owner KMW Leasing of Salt Lake City, Utah (owned by the founder and former CEO of Extra Space Storage, who in turn also is a part-owner of Dynamic Airways) acquired the plane from AVE.com in June 2006, who subsequently leased the airframe on a \\"power by the hour\\" basis to MAXjet and Sunny Airways prior to its placement with Dynamic. Despite its age of nearly 30 years, as of October 6, 2015, the airframe had only flown for 29,970 hours over 9,937 flight cycles. Previous to being leased by Dynamic Airways, the aircraft was in dry storage for approximately 29 months. Dynamic had only logged 240 hours during the six-week period prior to the fire at Fort Lauderdale. Investigation The National Transportation Safety Board has begun an investigation. On November 3, 2015, the NTSB released an update to its ongoing investigation, which stated that they found that the main fuel supply line coupling assembly had disconnected in the wing-to-engine strut above and behind the left engine. Examination of the left engine revealed no evidence of an engine uncontainment or other failure. Also, the lower inboard portion of the left wing, left engine cowling, and left fuselage center section sustained thermal damage. The fire did not penetrate the fuselage. The report condemned some passengers for taking their luggage.

The IFA teams, Columbia, Harvard, Princeton, and Yale, are now members of the Ivy League.  From soccer to rugby  The 1869 game between Princeton and Rutgers, which has been called the first intercollegiate football game in America, was a version of association football, known in North America as soccer. The rules were based on London's The Football Association and the round ball could not be advanced by carrying or throwing it. The first IFA was founded in 1873 by Princeton, Yale, and Rutgers to adopt common rules to replace the practice of playing under the home team's rules. Harvard refused to attend the founding meeting, preferring to keep the \\"Boston game\\", a cross between soccer and rugby football.  Massasoit House conventions  Walter Camp, pictured here in 1878 as the captain of the Yale University football team. On November 23, 1876, representatives from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia met at the Massasoit House in Springfield, Massachusetts to standardize a new code of rules based on the rugby game first introduced to Harvard by McGill University in 1874. The rules were based largely on the Rugby Football Union's code from England, though one important difference was the replacement of a kicked goal with a touchdown as the primary means of scoring (a change that would later occur in rugby itself, favoring the try as the main scoring event). Three of the schools—Harvard, Columbia, and Princeton—formed the second Intercollegiate Football Association as a result of the meeting. Yale did not join the group until 1879, because of an early disagreement about the number of players per team. This was the first comprehensive effort to organize and standardize American football. This IFA lasted from the 1877 season until 1893. Walter Camp, the \\"father of American football\\", was instrumental in creating the rules of American football. Camp became a fixture at the annual Massasoit House conventions where rules were debated and changed. He proposed a rule change at the first meeting he attended in 1878: a reduction from fifteen players to eleven. The motion was rejected at that time but passed in 1880. The effect was to open up the game and emphasize speed over strength. Camp's most famous change, the establishment of the line of scrimmage and the snap from center to quarterback, was also passed in 1880. At the 1882 rules meeting, Camp proposed that a team be required to advance the ball a minimum of five yards within three downs.

Ayesha was introduced as a Practice Nurse at The Mill, and made her first appearance on 30 September 2014. Since her arrival in the series, Ayesha has faced storylines such as her relationship with Sid Vere (Ashley Rice), dealing with her mother's alcohol and drug addictions, and being drugged in a bar. In May 2020, Rollins confirmed her departure from the cast of Doctors, and her final scenes aired on 5 June 2020. Casting Rollins became aware of the role the night before initial casting auditions took place. Rollins' agent gave her three scenes to prepare for her audition. She booked the day off work claiming to be ill, to free up her time and attend the audition. She met with Doctors' casting directors Rowland Beckley and Stephen Moore, and showcased her audition. Rollins told James Collins from Mandy.com that \\"it was really relaxed and fun to play the scenes.\\" She got recalled to the second stage of auditioning where she met with producers. She performed an additional four scenes in character. There Rollins was also able to ask questions and give her opinion on how she perceived Ayesha to be. One week later, Rollins was contacted to confirm she had secured the role. Rollins' casting was announced on 19 July 2014. Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy reported that Ayesha would \\"shake things up for the existing staff members.\\" Rollins stated that Ayesha would be a practice nurse with a \\"very dramatic\\" introduction into the series. Development Ayesha is characterised as a feisty female with a penchant for partying. The BBC Online publicity team describe her persona as \\"kind, practical and feisty but can also be sulky and sarcastic.\\" They branded her \\"a real party animal\\" and her constant clubbing often result in hangovers and lateness. Rollins told a reporter from Inside Soap that \\"I'm lucky that Ayesha is well-rounded, and has a fun side as well as a more fierce nature.\\" The actress believed Ayesha made a good friend for her colleagues because \\"her core values are good, and she is fiercely loyal.\\" Ayesha is portrayed as an unlucky in love female, whose relationships always come to an end. Rollins said that it would be nice for Ayesha to have better luck with men, but found relationships in turmoil \\"more interesting to play.\\" To aid the role of a nurse, Rollins learned basic medical skills such as taking a pulse and syringing human ears. Rollins also enjoyed playing the \\"grief-stricken\\" version of Ayesha because she found it difficult. She added that \\"in terms of being an actress, it's the most challenging thing I've done, and has been very rewarding.\\" Writers gave the character a dramatic introduction into the series. Ayesha arrives at The Mill to work as a nurse. Rollins explained that Ayesha would be unique because writers had chosen to explore her extended family. She added that Ayesha would share stories with her mother, Bren Lee (Andrea Gordon) and younger sister, Debs Lee (Rebecca Carrie). Ayesha's family were used to add heightened drama to the show. Of this, Rollins stated that \\"Ayesha's family all have their own emotional baggage, which will get thrust onto The Mill. It's really exciting stuff and there's some quite harrowing, high-stakes stories happening.\\" Bren is portrayed as an alcoholic who makes life difficult for Ayesha. Rollins explained that \\"Bren was quite a contentious character, and Andrea is such an excellent actress that it was never hard to play those scenes with her.\\" Bren was only featured in Doctors for a short time but Rollins was delighted with the story. She explained that the story had \\"naturally reached its conclusion and it was a really good exit for her.\\" In another story, Doctors producers decided to create a series of episodes to coincide with the \\"Mental Health Awareness Week\\" campaign. The episodes featured a local outreach bus being brought in to allow patients to visit and share their mental health. Rollins told Inside Soap's Allison Jones that Ayesha's role in the story is to medically assess the patients with sensitivity. She explained that \\"it's all about how she - along with the rest of her Mill colleagues - deals with these people, without casting judgement.\\" Rollins confirmed her departure from Doctors in late May 2020. She admitted that leaving the show was \\"a scary decision to make\\", but she wanted to pursue new acting roles on the stage and in film, as well as more television. Rollins told Allison Jones of Inside Soap that she was in every scene during her last day of filming, which left her little time to think about her departure, until the final scene in the storyline when she realised that she was saying goodbye to her character. Ayesha's departure aired on 5 June 2020, as she makes the decision to leave The Mill for \\"a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\\". Storylines Ayesha begins working at The Mill and develops an instant attraction to Sid Vere (Ashley Rice). They begin dating but after they have sex, Ayesha believes their relationship is developing too fast. She behaves in a reluctant manner which causes a separation. They begin to develop romantic feelings for one another but Ayesha vomits on Sid, which abruptly ends their relationship. Ayesha's half-sister, Debs asks for her help with their struggling mother Bren, but Ayesha refuses to intervene. Debs eventually makes Ayesha reconsider and upon visiting Bren, she blames Ayesha for her other daughter, Sierra being taken away by her aunt. Ayesha calls a rehab centre but there is a six-month waiting list. Ayesha then finds Bren drunk and leaves. Bren arrives at The Mill, begging Ayesha for alcohol. Ayesha meets policeman Tyler Green (David Atkins) and they clash due to Ayesha's distrust of police. Initially hesitant, Ayesha agrees to go on a date with Tyler. Ayesha is later disgusted to find that her colleague Valerie Pitman (Sarah Moyle) has been assaulted by a student. Ayesha is disappointed when Tyler invites Karen Hollins (Jan Pearson) and Rob Hollins (Chris Walker) on a date to a bowling alley. She feels that he undervalued by Tyler which causes an argument. Tyler tracks down Bren which causes Ayesha to accuse Tyler of meddling. Ayesha then confides in Emma Reid (Dido Miles) and she advises her not to visit Bren to avoid damaging her reputation; she also defends Tyler's actions. Bren steals money and a laptop computer from Ayesha's home. Ayesha agrees to not inform the police on the condition they cease contact. Ayesha subsequently ends her relationship with Tyler. Ayesha dating social worker Leo Tomas (Aaron Fontaine), who is working on a case of child endangerment with one of Ayesha's patients. The pair begin a relationship and Leo asks Ayesha to move in with him. Ayesha has doubts about their relationship and makes list of pros and cons about Leo, which he finds and confronts her. Ayesha acts blase about the negative points, but the pair agree to end their romance. While on a night out with Imogen Hollins (Charlie Clemmow), Ayesha is drugged in a student bar, and falls unconscious. When she awakens, she panics, unsure of what has happened to her. Emma performs a test on her to see whether or not Ayesha was raped; the test determines she was not. When Ayesha becomes dissatisfied with the waiting times of prescribing in The Mill, Becky Clarke (Ali Bastian) suggests that she takes a course in nurse prescribing. She gets the permission of Becky and Zara Carmichael (Elisabeth Dermot Walsh), but is unable to persuade Daniel Granger (Michael Chambers), to which Ayesha gets annoyed about. Daniel later agrees, and Ayesha begins her course paid for by The Mill. She passes, and in January 2020, she begins prescribing medication for patients. Upon discovering this, Zara insists on reviewing the prescriptions that Ayesha sets for patients. However, Zara later visits advanced nurse practitioner Harry Pierce (Tom Hall), who gives Joe Granger Carmichael (Oliver Falconer) a correct prescription, and Zara agrees to let Ayesha independently prescribe. For Valentine's Day, Bear Sylvester (Dex Lee) gifts Ayesha an expensive bracelet, and confused by the gesture, she follows him. Ayesha finds him transporting boxes to a lockup at night, and informs Daniel and Zara about what she saw. He reveals that he has been ordering lubricant through The Mill, selling it onto sex shops for a profit, and transferring the money into The Mill's account to help with the low NHS funding. Valerie and Bear take part in a charity ball, and Ayesha learns the routine from watching Valerie perform it at home. Needing more dance practice while Valerie is busy, Bear asks Ayesha to dance with him. They dance and become close to kissing, until Valerie interrupts them. After the charity ball, Valerie asks Ayesha if she has feelings for Bear, but she describes him as arrogant, and insists that she is not interested in him, unaware that Bear is listening. She continues to pursue a friendship with Bear, but when he responds coldly, the pair have an argument in his office, which is interrupted by Zara. She is told by Zara that she should behave professionally at work, and in response, Ayesha agrees to be civil with Bear. With Bear, Ayesha starts a campaign to persuade BAME not to opt-out of organ donation, titled #DontOptOut. She enlists Sid, Shak Hanif (Sunjay Midda) and Jimmi Clay (Adrian Lewis Morgan) to help, and the group film an advertisement for social media. After the #DontOptOut campaign is featured in a newspaper, the group celebrate its success with a drink at The Icon, and when Jimmi and Shak leave, Ayesha and Bear are left alone, where they discuss starting another campaign in the future. Ayesha returns home with Bear, where the pair sleep together. A former university friend of Ayesha, Fern Williams (Ellena Vincent), phones Ayesha with talk of an opportunity. She meets with her at Fern's office, where she offers Ayesha a job opportunity as a Project Manager for a worldwide campaign, with a large salary and travel opportunities. Ayesha asks Valerie for advice, who pushes her to pursue it. She then meets with Zara, and tells her about the job offer, stating that if The Mill can offer a higher salary, she would consider staying out of loyalty. Zara takes offence to what Ayesha says, but agrees to let her work a 30-day notice. Ayesha learns that Valerie has accidentally told Bear about the job offer, who is hurt that Ayesha kept it a secret from him despite them beginning a new relationship. She tells Bear that the job comes with a one-year contract, and that he could hire a temporary nurse in case she wants to return. Ayesha then receives a call from Fern, who tells her that training for the job will start in a few days, so she meets with Zara again to inform her, who is furious with Ayesha. Ayesha calls Zara a \\"jealous old cow\\", and states that Zara \\"would grab the opportunity with two hands\\" if she was 20 years younger. In return, Zara fires Ayesha. Ayesha tells Bear about being sacked, and he tells her that he feels Ayesha has used him for career opportunities. She states that she is happy with the outcome, and walks out of The Mill. Valerie hosts a leaving party for Ayesha, which Emma, Sid and Al Haskey (Ian Midlane) attend. Zara later arrives to apologise for firing Ayesha, and informs her that she always has a job at The Mill. After the party, Ayesha tearfully looks over photos from her time at The Mill. Reception For her portrayal of Ayesha, Rollins has been nominated for several awards and won one.

Design and construction The Class 670 was designed by Eng. Giuseppe Zara of the Rete Adriatica (one of the two major railway companies in Italy at the beginning of the twentieth century); its design was very unorthodox, as the boiler was reversed on the frames, so that the cab and the firebox were leading and supported by the bogie, while the cylinders were at the rear. The compound arrangement was also highly peculiar, as it was the first experiment with the Plancher compound engine: this arrangement meant that there were four cylinders, in which the two high pressure (HP) ones and the two low pressure (LP) ones were paired together respectively on the left- hand and the right-hand side of the boiler, and each pair was served by a single piston valve through a crossed-port arrangement. While simplifying the valve gear, this feature made it difficult to equalize the work done by each pair of cylinders, and this provoked hunting. The locomotive also had a peculiar arrangement for its tender; the coal was kept near the cab on the left side of the locomotive, while a tender carried either of water, depending on the series. The first locomotive, initially classified as RA 3701 (later changed to RA 500), was taken to France and subjected to trials with a dynamometer car loaned by the Chemin de Fer de l'Ouest, which were successful. As a result, other forty-two were built by Ernesto Breda and the German firm Borsig-Werke. When in 1905 the railways in Italy were nationalised, the Ferrovie dello Stato initially reclassified the locomotives as Class 690 (FS 69XX), but were ultimately classified as Class 670. Operations Nicknamed Mucca (Italian for \\"cow\\"), the Class 670 spent its career on the mainline railways of the Po Valley; while quite fast and powerful for its day, the unorthodox shape of the locomotive in the end didn't prove successful, with more orthodox designs (like the FS Class 680) eventually being built. Withdrawals of both the Class 670 and Class 671 locomotives began in the 1930s, and by the end of the decade all the locomotives had been taken out of service; none survived into preservation. Variants and experiments =Class 671= Between 1919 and 1930 29 Class 670 locomotives were rebuilt with a superheater, and were classified as Class 671. =Franco-Crosti= In 1936 the locomotive 670.030 was rebuilt with a Franco-Crosti boiler. Articulated ducts carried the combustion gases from the main boiler to the preheater (placed on a standard bogie tender), and these passed to a chimney at the end of the tender. Exhaust steam from the cylinders similarly went through articulated ducts to the blastpipe at the rear of the tender, while articulated pipes connected the preheater and main boiler to take water and steam from one to the other. The whole locomotive-tender complex was given a streamlined casing. The locomotive was reclassified FS 672.001 and was subjected to trial runs, which showed a 22 per cent fuel saving compared to other Class 671 locomotives. Although it paved the way to other, more successful conversions, this locomotive was only meant as a trial essay, and was quickly discarded.

The letters serve a guidebook for his friend, Zach Walker (a pseudonym), and draw on Greitens’ personal experiences and knowledge of ancient and modern philosophers. Background In 2012, Greitens received a phone call from a friend and former SEAL, Zach Walker, whom he served with in the Navy, asking him for help. The introduction of his book Resilience describes the character of Walker, \\"a tough guy who would do anything for anyone\\". Yet, when he returned home, Walker was struggling with PTSD, losing his sense of purpose. Although it had been over a decade since they served together, Greitens and Walker began talking and exchanging letters almost daily, giving help to his friend who was in dire need.Greitens, Eric. Resilience: Hard-Won Wisdom for Living a Better Life. New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2015, page ix. Print. Greitens discusses how his friend's story is unique, but that many people deal with loss, fear, and a loss of purpose. His book Resilience, offers advice to his friend, that is intended to be useful to any reader in overcoming hardship and becoming a resilient person. Content In his book, Greitens covers many topics, meant to help his friend recover and heal including: happiness, identity, philosophy, pain, freedom, and death. In discussing happiness, Greitens says to Walker, \\"When I was in Iraq, we knew that our work was saving the lives of American marines. We woke up everyday to live a life that mattered. When you come home from war, all of that -- the adrenaline, the love, the purpose, the pursuit, the calling -- vanishes. The happiness of excellence, of personal endeavor, is gone.\\"Greitens, Eric. Resilience: Hard-Won Wisdom for Living a Better Life. New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2015, page 61. Print. Greitens repeatedly mentions the importance of purpose in attaining happiness and flourishing. In another letter to his friend, Greitens writes about pain, stressing the difference between physical pain and emotional pain, and pain we seek and pain that seeks us. He offers the following advice on pain: \\"To work through pain is not to make it disappear, but to make it mean something different for us -- to turn it into wisdom.\\"Greitens, Eric. Resilience: Hard-Won Wisdom for Living a Better Life. New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2015, page 166. Print. Greitens also gives advice on the notion of freedom, telling Walker that he should \\"give yourself the freedom to live a life that's balanced -- not like a seesaw but like a beautiful work of art.\\" Greitens, Eric. Resilience: Hard-Won Wisdom for Living a Better Life. New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2015, page 258. Print. Reception Publishers Weekly said that \\"Greitens sets out a series of practical lessons designed to move his friend—and readers—past difficulties. Greitens doesn’t sugarcoat the difficulties involved in following his advice, but he convincingly argues that those who accept it are on the road to a brighter future.

A eutriconodont, it is known from the Cedar Mountain Formation, and is both a large sized and possibly ecologically specialised taxon, showcasing the diversity of mammals in the Mesozoic. Description Jugulator is known primarily from isolated teeth and dentaries. The species is most distinctive in regards to its large size, being among the largest mammals in the region, some lower molars exceeding 5 mm in length and with an estimated body weight of about 750 g. The medial lower incisor is greatly enlarged, with a mitten- shaped crown that bears sharp cutting surfaces. Phylogeny Always recognised as a triconodontid eutriconodont, the most recent phylogenetic studies recover Jugulator as the sister taxon of a clade comprising Volaticotherium, Ichthyoconodon, Triconolestes, and Argentoconodon, known as Volaticotherini.A. O. Averianov and A. V. Lopatin. 2011. Phylogeny of Triconodonts and Symmetrodonts and the Origin of Extant Mammals. Doklady Biological Sciences 436:32-35 [M. Uhen/M. Uhen] Biology Jugulator is noted as being a rather large mammal for Mesozoic standards. Combined with the general adaptations for carnivory that eutriconodonts display, it is safe to say that it was a predator of other vertebrates like mammals, lizards and small dinosaurs. Other large eutriconodonts like Repenomamus and Gobiconodon show evidence of scavenging and direct predation on such creatures, so it is likely that Jugulator also displayed these behaviours. Ecology Jugulator occurs in the mid-Cretaceous deposits of the Cedar Mountain Formation, where several of North America's more iconic dinosaurs like Utahraptor and Cedarosaurus occur. A large variety of mammal species are known from here as well, including other eutriconodonts like Astroconodon and Corviconodon as well as multituberculates like Cedaromys and Janumys and several therian mammals such as Montanalestes and Atokatheridium. These diverse mammal faunas offer a transition from dominant taxa in the Early Cretaceous and the multituberculate and therian dominated laurasian mammalian faunas of the Late Cretaceous.

The game was announced in 2014 at Gamescom. According to DLCompare, new images were released in April 2020 and the game is still in development. Gameplay Wild is set during the prehistoric Neolithic period (approximately 10,000–2,500 BC), in a procedurally generated world of seemingly infinite size. Within the game world, the player controls a human and can use smaller animals to spy on others, or larger animals to support the player and their tribe in fights with other humans. Animals can be controlled by using shamanic powers - once \\"possessing\\" an animal the gameplay moves to the point of view of the controlled creature, and then proceeds using the skills and characteristics of that animal. Development Wild began development in 2014 at Wild Sheep Studio, a developer based in Montpellier founded by Michel Ancel from Ubisoft. Initial plans for the game included a very large, continent-sized open world, dynamic weather complete with seasonal variations, online play, and the ability to play as any wild creature in the world, including wolves, sheep, fish, ants, cats, birds, etc. A gameplay trailer for the game was shown at Gamescom in August 2014 and then at Paris Games Week in October 2015, where the developers released a new gameplay trailer and a film about the production of the game. Despite lead designer Michel Ancel posting screenshots of the game on social media in January 2017, many journalists have cited the game to be vaporware. When Ancel announced his departure in September 2020, he stated that both the project and Beyond Good and Evil 2 were in capable hands with his departure.

Early life and education The son of Fannie and Robert Gordis, Leon was born in New York City and raised in Far Rockaway, Queens. Robert was a prominent Conservative rabbi and biblical scholar at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York. Gordis moved to Baltimore in the 1960s after earning degrees from Columbia University and the Jewish Theological Seminary, and a medical degree at the State University of New York Downstate College of Medicine. He earned a master's degree in public health (MPH) in 1966 and a doctorate of public health (DrPH) in 1968 from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health (later named the Bloomberg School of Public Health). Abraham Lilienfeld, prominent public health pioneer, served as Gordis’ advisor. Professional experience Gordis completed his pediatrics training at Hopkins while also a member of the U.S. Public Health Service. He joined the faculty of the Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in 1971, teaching epidemiology. Gordis then became chair of the Department of Epidemiology in 1975, a position he held until 1993. During his tenure at Hopkins, Gordis designed and taught courses at both the School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where he became Associate Dean for Admissions and Academic Affairs. He also authored Epidemiology, now in its fifth edition, and considered by many as the seminal textbook on epidemiologic principles and clinical practice applications. PowerPoint slides taken directly from the book have been translated for public health students around the world. He established a cardiovascular fellowship program in 1980 with an institutional grant from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. More recently, Leon was named a visiting professor at Tel-Aviv University School of Medicine and School of Public Health in 2007. The Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research, which has enriched the schools of public health, medicine and nursing, is in no small part a culmination of Leon’s vision and commitment to collaboration. Gordis faced controversy from many in the health care industry in the 1990s when he served as chairman of a National Institutes of Health (NIH) expert panel, suggesting that women in their 40s may not require routine mammograms but instead, should weigh the tests' risks and benefits and decide for themselves. Personal life Gordis died of a subdural hematoma on September 7, 2015 at Mount Sinai Roosevelt Hospital in New York. His funeral and burial were held the next day in Jerusalem. Gordis and his wife, Hadassah, were long-time residents of Pikesville, Maryland, and in later life, also lived in Israel. They have three sons, eight grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

The series featured Batman, Robin, and their allies, and was a follow up series to Batman Eternal. Batman and Robin Eternal was written by James Tynion IV, Scott Snyder, Tim Seeley, Steve Orlando, Genevieve Valentine, Jackson Lanzing, Collin Kelly, and Ed Brisson. Batman Day 8-page preview In September 2015, DC Comics held another Batman Day celebration, re-releasing Batman #35 as Batman: Endgame Special Edition for free in stores and electronically. This comic contained an 8-page preview of Batman and Robin Eternal written by Tynion and drawn by Tony S. Daniel, announced as the lead artist for the series. The 8-page preview format matched what DC Comics had done at the end of the Convergence event, with 8-page previews giving readers a taste of the new, relaunched, or continuing series coming in June. In the preview, two timelines converge on the climax of the forthcoming series - Batman hiding a secret on a Bat-flashdrive concerning the villain \\"Mother\\" from Dick Grayson many years ago, while Grayson was still Robin, and in the future, a massive worldwide battle between Mother's forces and the Batfamily. Plot The series toggles between the present, where Dick Grayson and his allies battle the plans of the mysterious Mother, and the past, where Batman and Robin face the Scarecrow for the first time. =Present= Dick Grayson, on assignment for Spyral, teams up with Tim Drake (Red Robin) and Jason Todd (Red Hood) to stop a cyborg cyclist. Later, he is attacked by a group of children and his own field handler, both claiming to act on behalf of someone called \\"Mother\\". Running away, he meets a nearly silent young woman who also says one word - \\"Mother\\", but instead of attempting to kill him, she deliberately holds back and gives him a Bat-flashdrive containing a confession from Batman, as well as a list of names. The recording identifies the young woman as Cassandra Cain. Harper Row, bitter that Batman's apparent death at the hand of the Joker has robbed her of the chance to be Batman's partner, suffers an attack by one of Mother's agents calling himself the Orphan. Cassandra Cain saves her, then chases after the Orphan. Dick meets Harper and her roommate Stephanie Brown (the Spoiler), and takes them to the Batcave to get Harper medical attention and meet with Tim and Jason. Dick's superior, Helena Bertinlli, Matron of Spyral, discovers that Mother's agents are going to attack Bruce Wayne at a party. Dick rushes off to save Bruce, and is met by members of the We Are Robin gang (including Duke Thomas) and Batgirl. They save Bruce from dozens of ax-wielding assassins, and Dick follows a lead while Tim, Jason, and Stephanie deal with the disappearance of an injured Harper and the mysterious Cassandra. Dick's lead turns out to be Tim's witness-protection-program parents, which causes a split in the Robins - Tim and Jason investigating one lead, Dick another. Dick, Harper, and Cass head to Prague, where they find Mother waiting for them. She entices Dick to join her, but he rejects her offer and instead battles her agents at the ballet alongside Harper and Cass. In the wake of their victory, Harper accidentally triggers something in Cass, who flees. Jason and Tim follow the electronic signal that coincided with the attack on Bruce and find Bane attempting to take back his former country from the mysterious Order of St. Dumas. Working together with the villain, Jason and Tim stumble upon Azrael, also known as Jean-Paul Valley, apparently another one of Mother's children, sold to the Order as an angel of death against their enemies. Tim suffers the effects of Azrael's mental attack, and Jason carries him away to safety. Dick and Harper follow the trail of the Orphan to the identity of David Cain, but are surprised to find the Sculptor, Cain's other half in Mother's inner circle. The Sculptor has powerful telepathic powers which Mother uses to shape children traumatized by Cain's violence. Using these powers, the Sculptor shows Harper Cassandra's training, deprived of language so that she must read movement and body cues, and forced to kill a woman in a dark alley. Dick breaks the mind meld when the Sculptor begins showing Harper Batman's meetings and deals with Mother, but the Sculptor only shows Dick her own orphaning and abduction by Mother, as well as a few hints of what Batman did in her service, before she disappears and reveals the entire encounter was her projection. Based on the Sculptor's warning, Dick and Harper know that Mother is murdering all of her old children, and rush to her training center, the Nursery, where they find Cassandra standing against her father. Inspired by her meeting with Batman, Cassandra paints the Bat on her face with blood as a mask, and together, Dick, Harper, and Cass fight their way past the Orphan to escape from the nuclear self destruction of the base and on to Spyral's headquarters to plan their next moves. =Past= In Dick's first confrontation with a supervillain as Batman's partner, Batman and Robin face Jonathan Crane's students, driven by Scarecrow's fear toxin. Later, they are ambushed by Crane in a cornfield and first exposed to the fear toxin. They follow Scarecrow to a meeting with the Orphan and Cassandra Cain, and discover that the villains are headed to Prague. After a failed attempt to stop Scarecrow's plane, Bruce discovers the existence of a woman known as Mother from a fellow society member, who tells him he purchased his wife made to order by this human trafficker. The man is murdered by the Orphan that night, and Batman keeps the secret from Dick, telling him that they are chasing Scarecrow alone to Prague. After setting up an international Batcave, Batman secretly meets with Mother and Orphan, apparently wanting to replace Dick with a more reliable partner. Batman and Robin conduct an assault on Scarecrow's warehouse, and while Robin disables a bomb on the roof, Batman forces Scarecrow to work for him against Mother. In his ambition, Scarecrow reveals that Mother plans to gas every major city in the world with his newly created \\"trauma toxin\\", leaving billions of children ripe for her new process of brainwashing and manipulation. Premise and characters At San Diego Comic- Con 2015, Tynion and Snyder announced that Cassandra Cain would return to mainstream continuity in Batman and Robin Eternal, and serve as one of three main characters alongside Dick Grayson and Harper Row (Bluebird).

Something Better to Come won the Special Jury Award at the world's biggest documentary festival – IDFA, where the film had premiered.  Content  In 2000, in parallel with shooting The Children of Leningradsky, Hanna began working on Something Better to Come. This was the same year Vladimir Putin stepped into power in Russia and coincidentally, the story of Yula, the main character of the film, is parallel to the unfolding story of Putin's Russia. Ten-year-old Yula has but one dream – to lead a normal life. For 14 years, Hanna Polak follows Yula as she grows up in the forbidden territory of Svalka, the garbage dump located 13 miles from the Kremlin in Putin's Russia. Something Better to Come is Yula's story – a dramatic tale of coming of age and maturing to the point of taking destiny into one's own hands. It is a story of hope, courage, and life, all shot in gripping vérité style that stuns with its directness and immediacy.  Reception  The film has received wide positive acclaim from critics. Mark Adams from Screen Daily stated that Something Better to Come is \\"strikingly visceral and plaintively moving documentary that is arresting right from its first powerful moments\\" and added that \\"This is a film that packs an emotional punch and is strikingly directed and shot by the talented Hanna Polak.\\" Aleksandr Gorbachev from Newsweek called the film \\"a great coming-of-age story – Boyhood from a trash can.\\" Sheri Linden from Los Angeles Times described the film as \\"work of powerful images – heart-rending, elegiac, charged with hope.\\" Joshua Oppenheimer, director of The Act of Killing, stated that his \\"most powerful experience of nonfiction cinema this year was [...] Something Better to Come.\\" While Neil Young from The Hollywood Reporter reviewed it as \\"an eye-opening documentary.\\" = Awards = * Special Jury Prize International Documentary, Hot Springs Documentary Film Festival (USA) * Youth Jury Award, (Germany) * Best Documentary Award, Jameson CineFest (Hungary) * Berlin's Favorite Award and Bremen's Favourite Award, Favourites Film Festival Berlin (Germany) * The Estonian People's Award, Pärnu Film Festival (Estonia) * Best Documentary, Valletta Film Festival (Malta) * Best International Feature Award, Documentary Edge Festival (New Zealand) * Best Cinematography, Gdansk DocFilm Festival (Poland) * Special Mention, Underhill Festival (Montenegro) * Special Award Club 418 Mirror of Art DocFest and Small Mirror of Art DocFest, Andrey Tarkovsky International Film Festival (Russia) * Millennium Award for Best Feature Documentary Film and Canon Non Fiction Frame Special Mention, Docs Against Gravity (Poland) * VIKTOR Main Competition DOK.international, DOK.fest Munich (Germany * Second prize of the Jury, DocumentaMadrid (Spain) * Special Mention, One World Brussels (Belgium) * Jury's Main Prize, Eurodok – European Documentary Film Festival (Norway) * Special Mention, ZagrebDox (Croatia) * Grand Prix, Open Documentary Film Festival \\"Artdocfest\\" (Russia) * Youth Jury Award, International Film Festival and Forum on Human Rights (Switzerland) * Alpe Adria Cinema Award: Best Documentary, Trieste Film Festival (Italy) * Special Jury Award, International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA) (Netherlands)  References   External links   * Oscars: 124 Pics Vying For Feature Documentary Trophy - Deadline Hollywood * Something Better to Come - Facebook Category:2014 films Category:Polish documentary films Category:Polish films Category:Danish documentary films Category:Danish films Category:Documentary films about street children Category:Documentary films about Russia Category:2014 documentary films ","title":"Something Better to Come"},{"id":"48407115","text":"Streptomyces amakusaensis is a bacterium species from the genus of Streptomyces which has been isolated from soil from the Amakusa Island in Japan.UniProtDeutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen ATCC Streptomyces amakusaensis produces tuberin and nagstatin.

After Tom Poes it was his second most successful and well known comic strip and very popular in foreign translations. It debuted in 1946 and ran until 1991. Concept Panda is a funny animal comic strip about a young panda, Panda. The stories take place in a fantasy environment with anthropomorphic animals. Like many Dutch comic strips in the 1940s and 1950s it was published in a text comic format, with the text below the images. Later stories have been published as a balloon comic too. =Characters= * Panda: A young, smart and intelligent panda who travels into the wide world. In terms of design he looks very similar to Tom Poes. He lives in Hobbeldonk. * Jollipop: A dog who is Panda's personal servant. In terms of design he is an expy of Joost, the butler of Oliver B. Bumble in the Tom Poes stories. * Joris Goedbloed: A sly fox who is a con-artist and a trickster. He often expresses himself in macaronic Latin. He serves as the antagonist of the series, but despite his lies, tricks and frequent abuse of Panda's confidence he also ensures that the little bear is not put in actual danger. History Marten Toonder created the strip on December 23, 1946. The series was a success in the Netherlands, but was also published in Australia, Belgium, Curaçao, Denmark, Germany, Great Britain, Finland, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, Norway, Iceland and Sweden. Most of the art work was done by his personal studio, Toonder Studios. Among the artists who drew the series are Jan Gerhard Toonder, Lo Hartog van Banda, Eiso Toonder, Wim Lensen, Ben van Voorn, Richard Klokkers, Jaap Lamberton, Harry Hargreaves, Terry Willers, Fred Julsing, Dick Matena and Piet Wijn. About 199 stories have been drawn. On December 31, 1991 the final episode was published. Availability The Dutch publishing company Panda, who specialize in luxury editions of Dutch comics, were named after the series.

The name derives from \\"ghurāb\\" or \\"ghorāb\\", Arabic for raven, which in turn came into Marathi and Konkani as \\"gurab\\". The ghurāb was originally a galley, but the type evolved. The grab combined an indigenous hull form with a pointed prow, with or without a bowsprit, combined with European rigging on two to three masts. A description from 1750 states that the grabs of Angria's fleet narrowed from the middle forward and instead of a bow had the prow of a Mediterranean galley, covered with a strong deck level with the main deck but separated from it by a bulkhead. The grab pitched violently when sailing against a head sea so the prow sides were open to permit water easily to run off. On the main deck under the forecastle there were two 6 or 9-pounder guns pointing forward through port-holes cut in the bulkhead and firing over the prow. The grabs then had 6 or 9-pounder guns on their broadsides.Gazetteer (1894). pp. 523-4. The vessel was generally of shallow draft, and broad in proportion to its length. Size could range between 150 and as much as 500 tons (bm). The sail plan typically was that of a snow, or a brig. The Bombay Marine, the British East India Company's (EIC) navy, had two grabs named Bombay that overlaped in their service dates. The Bombay Dockyard built both. *Bombay, of 430 tons (bm) and 24 guns, was built in 1739 of teak. She spent much of her career convoying vessels on the coast to protect them from pirates operating from states north and south of Bombay. A fire on 29 September 1789 destroyed her in Bombay Harbour. *Bombay, of 363 tons (bm), and 32 guns, was launched in 1750.

Evaluating Three Decades of Reform and Change in UK Central Government is a book written by Christopher Hood and Ruth Dixon, and published by Oxford University Press in 2015. The authors attempt to assess the success of three decades of New Public Management, which was intended to create \\"a government that works better and costs less\\", concluding that \\"The short answer seems to be: higher costs and more complaints\\". The book was described by Michael Moran as \\"brilliant, highly original\\", and he concluded that \\"Future researchers will see further precisely because they will be able to stand on the shoulders of these scholars\\". In November 2015 the book was awarded the Louis Brownlow Book Award of the National Academy of Public Administration \\"for its comprehensive study of reform, cost and performance\\". In November 2016 it was awarded the W. J. M. Mackenzie award of the Political Studies Association, the jury stating that the book \\"carries considerable implications for policy-making, as well as the field of academic enquiry which it addresses.\\" The book was repeatedly cited in Michael Barber's report Delivering better outcomes for citizens: practical steps for unlocking public value. In a review published in Civil Service World, and subsequently republished in Total Politics, Austin Mitchell wrote that \\"the message of this book is clear and simple: don’t believe the messianic idea merchants who tell us that their reforms will put everything right, or that if you make senior civil servants managers and delivery boys rather than policy wonks, all will be well\\". Sir David Bell summarised the conclusions for Times Higher Education as \\"Rather prosaically, but perhaps unsurprisingly, Hood and Dixon conclude that, actually, government has cost a bit more and worked a bit worse over the period\\". Writing for the LSE Review of Books Tom Thatcham described the book as \\"required reading for students of New Public Management\\". In The Guardian David Walker described the authors as \\"ingenious\\" and \\"painstaking\\". The book received four separate reviews in the academic journal Governance, and further reviews in the Journal of Contemporary European Studies, in Political Studies Review, and in Social Policy & Administration.

A train was scheduled to leave London Liverpool Street Station at 9.00am to Harwich, which connected with the paddle steamer Adelaide which departed at 11.00am to arrive in Antwerp the same evening. There was a corresponding return service from Antwerp on Tuesdays and Fridays, reaching London the same night. In addition the company offered an ordinary week-day service which left London Liverpool Street Station at 8.00pm every evening, with a connecting boat service overnight to Antwerp and Rotterdam, with arrivals early the following morning.

He was born in Brooklyn, New York City and went on to work in the fashion industry like his grandmother. Bevans has won awards from organizations such as Woolmark. Early life and education Christopher Bevans was born in Brooklyn, New York City to parents of Jamaican and Belizean descent. He grew up in Rochester, New York. His grandmother was a dressmaker in the 1960s and 70s. Bevans grew up around her business and industry, which caused him to become interested. While doing art, he would ask his grandmother for both assistance and materials. He and his family moved out of the city for a period of time while his father got a job with Kodak. Bevans started as an apprentice to a tailor as a teenager and became the shop's owner at 19. Bevans was the sole owner of a shoe repair shop, which did not do well, with Bevans owing this to his inexperience in running a small business. Bevans returned to New York City for his education, majoring in textiles at the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) and working as a freelance tailor in fashion and advertising, including Ang Lee's work for BMW Films and as a dresser at Bryant Park. Career After college, Bevans developed his skills as a designer for Sean John, where he worked on the CFDA award-winning 2004 collection, and as a senior designer for Rocawear, where he worked on Kanye West's unreleased first clothing line, Pastelle, created in collaboration with West on The College Dropout tour. Additionally, Bevans created his own line of custom menswear for celebrities, including Prince, Jay Z, John Legend and LeBron James. Bevans moved to Portland, Oregon in 2006 to join Nike as global design director of urban apparel. At Nike, he led the design of the Air Force 1 25th Anniversary campaign, the Blue Ribbon Sports collection, Roger Federer's \\"RF\\" logo and Kanye West's first collaboration with Nike on the Air Max 1. In 2012, Bevans became creative director of Billionaire Boys Club, the clothing line established by Pharrell Williams and Nigo. In 2013, Bevans was chosen by MIT Media Lab Director Joi Ito to be part of the inaugural Director's Fellows program, defined by Ito as \\"extraordinary individuals from a broad range of sectors and geographies to join us in doing collaborative research and to expand our growing global community.” Bevans joined speakers at the Media Lab's first Platform Summit, to address an audience of business and thought leaders in science, technology, finance, politics, education, media, design and the arts. He regularly lectures on mentorship and design, most notably for Cooper Hewitt and Art Dubai’s Global Art Forum. Since 2014, Bevans is working with Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch and Relativity Media to develop the Beast Mode brand, clothing and accessories line. In 2015, Bevans introduced DYNE, his debut line of tailored, technologically advanced sportswear, at Men's Fashion Week in New York City. DYNE has been in the work for years, and Bevans cites his love for technology, fabrics, sports, electronics, and tailoring. Bevans partnered with Google Cloud and Bemis Associates to debut their SS19 RTW collection during the New York Fashion Week Men's. DYNE-brand clothing features NFC chips embedded in them to provide information about the clothing and access playlists. Bevans was the creative director for Milan Fashion Week: Men's in 2019, for which he was praised as a good choice by Fashion United. He also collaborated with sustainable fashion brand “Save the Duck” in 2018. Bevans created an installation for his fall collection at his alma mater at FIT, being inspired to do so by having gotten his degree from the institute. In April 2019, Bevans participated as a judge in the Fashion Institute of Technology's Future of Fashion show. Bevans has also been a judge at the Green Carpet Fashion Awards, an awards show relating to sustainability. Other clients Bevans have worked with include P. Diddy, Kanye West, Pharrell, A$AP Rocky, Adidas, and Under Armor. Awards and accolades In 2017, Bevans won International Woolmark Prize regional final. He was also awarded Woolwork's Innovation Award for his 1980s-inspired snowboard outfit created under DYNE in January 2018. He was given AUS$100,000 as part of this award. One Woolmark Prize judge, Livia Firth, praised as an example of “young designers” who are “changing the conversation.” Bevans was named an honoree of the BE (Black Enterprise) Modern Man program. To commemorate Black History Month, Willamette Week listed Bevans among others as examples of black people who have made strides in the Portland fashion industry. He was featured in an article in and on the cover of Women's Wear Daily. The Council of Fashion Designers of America admitted Bevans to its 493-large organization, which only adds new members once per year. The Root writer Maiysha praised the induction of Bevans as well as Venus Williams as a sign of progress for the organization on admittance of black people.

Myers is a Canadian-American ecologist. In 2014 she was elected president of the Canadian Society for Ecology and Evolution. Professor Myers is well-known for her decades-long research into plant-animal-microbe interactions, including insect pest outbreaks, viral pathogens of insects, and pioneering work on biological control of insects and plants, particularly invasive species. Throughout her career she has advocated strongly for both the public understanding of science and for increasing the number of women in the STEM subjects: Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. Myers was a trustee of the Entomological Society of Canada. In 2004, she was awarded its Gold Medal for her contributions to the theory and practice of biological control. She also won the McCarthy Award from the Professional Pest Management Association of British Columbia. As a published author, she is widely held in libraries worldwide.  Research  Myers is known for her work on population cycles spanning more than four decades. She has made important contributions to understanding cycling dynamics through theory, reviews, and data via her long-term monitoring of western tent caterpillars. Early in her career Myers became one of the pioneers for studying biocontrol. Her research takes an interdisciplinary, collaborative, inclusive approach to the management of environmental pest problems. She emphasizes the importance of long-term ecological data with which to challenge and inform ecological models. Myers is currently (since 2006) Professor Emerita in the Department of Zoology at the University of British Columbia (UBC). She joined the faculty in 1972 after being a Miller Research Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley (1970-1972). She was cross-appointed to the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences (now Faculty of Land and Food Systems). Myers worked with fellow ecologists Charles Krebs, Tony (Anthony) R.E. Sinclair and her late husband, Jamie (James N.M.) Smith, initially in the Institute of Animal Resource Ecology and later in the Biodiversity Centre at UBC. Biography In addition to research, Myers made lasting contributions to teaching at UBC, notably developing the long-running 'Conservation Biology' course. She is the mother of Iain and Isla Myers-Smith, who were born in Vancouver, British Columbia and Canberra, Australia respectively. Isla Myers-Smith is currently a lecturer at the University of Edinburgh Myers has served on various NSERC (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada) committees, particularly those related to women in science including the Women's Faculty Award Committee and the Women in Science and Engineering Chair Program. She was a member of the NSERC Biological Control Network and was Theme leader – Greenhouses (2001-2006) and co-theme leader – New, improved microbial agents for management of insect pests (2001-2006).  Advocacy for women in STEM  Myers was at the forefront of Canadian post-secondary education's efforts to recruit more women in STEM fields during the late 1980s and early 1990s, when she was Associate Dean of Science at the University of British Columbia. At that time simply discussing data related to the leaky pipeline could be contentious. Myers is quoted on p. 298 of Martin Loney's 1998 book critiquing what he described as identity politics in Canadian post-secondary education, The Pursuit of Division: Race, Gender, and Preferential Hiring in Canada. Loney challenged Myers to produce data to support her assertion that policies impeding women being hired were operating during the 1960s. Research into the complex nature of barriers to women being hired in the post-secondary education STEM sector has since expanded significantly. Judy Myers continues to be a strong advocate for women in STEM. Myers describes some of her own experiences as a woman in STEM (including being the first person to take maternity leave in the UBC Faculty of Science) in a special issue of the journal Evolutionary Applications. In addition to her 2014-2016 presidency of the Canadian Society for Ecology and Evolution (CSEE), Myers is past President of the Canadian Coalition for Women in Science, Engineering, Trades and Technology (CCWESTT) and of the Society for Canadian Women in Science and Technology.

The first concepts of the theory were explored by Susan Cain in her book Quiet where she looked at how western cultures, particularly the United States, value extroversion over introversion and how that could possibly make it difficult for introverts to thrive in society. Northern Arizona University professor Jorge Rodriguez III took the idea a step further and viewed how the opposite could be viewed in eastern cultures where introversion is valued over extroversion. These observations and further research led to the concept of \\"personality bias\\" which suggests certain personalities are favored over others and that these opposing personalities are \\"intentionally or unintentionally oppressed or muted.\\" The concept of personality bias was later formally formulated into Temperament Isolation Theory. The theory is currently not widely accepted among social scientists, but it is gaining ground thanks to the research of Rodriguez and others.  History/Origins  The concept of personality bias was explored by Susan Cain in her book Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking, released in January, 2012. Cain explored how western cultures, particularly that of the United States, place much value on extroversion. The social structures of the U.S. including the workforce and public education encourage and teach people to be outspoken, engaging and group-minded. Cain refers to this bias as the \\"extrovert ideal\\" where people are valued for what they say and how they present themselves rather than their character, talents and skills. She also discusses the rise of collaboration and groupthink in the United States and how group work is seen as superior or more effective than individual contribution. Cain argues that the extrovert ideal has made it difficult for introverts to thrive and succeed in the United States. Cain also introduced definitions and parameters for temperament. According to the Cain, temperament (extroversion and introversion) is a person's core personality and influences many of the traits the person develops over his or her lifetime. Temperament is not defined on how social a person is or on whether they are shy or not. Rather, temperament is influenced by sensory sensitivity. Introverts are highly sensitive to outside stimulus and can often be overwhelmed by it. Extroverts are much less sensitive to stimulus and often need more exposure to it in order to feel a response. For example, an introvert may feel overwhelmed at a rock concert because she is sensitive to all the stimuli (music, lights, voices, touch etc.) and she is taking all of it in at once, whereas an extrovert is not sensitive and wants to experience these stimuli even more. Cain also notes that temperament is a spectrum rather a definitive extreme. Some introverts are less sensitive than others and feel more comfortable in social situations and vice versa. People lean more towards introversion or extroversion and, in some cases, fall in the middle (ambivert). Temperament can also be situational in which a single individual may exhibit more extroverted or introverted traits in specific situations. Temperament as it pertains to eastern cultures is also briefly touched on by Cain. She notes that eastern cultures are the opposite of western cultures in that they tend to value introversion over extroversion. She specifically examined the experiences of Asian-American families. Asian-Americans struggle a lot in American society because their culture and home life encourage introversion, but their social lives outside the home put pressure on them to be extroverted. Susan Cain and her book Quiet are credited with starting what is called the \\"Quiet Revolution\\" which calls for introverts to learn to value and appreciate themselves and use their strengths to find their place in society. The movement is rather small but is nonetheless designed to help introverts cope with inequalities and difficulties they face in an extroverted-dominated society.  Expansion and Social Scientific Research  Social Scientist and Associate Professor at Northern Arizona University Jorge Rodriguez III was intrigued by the ideas presented by Cain and began to research them scientifically in 2012. Rodriguez's research found that extroversion is indeed highly valued in the United States and that this value of extroversion often does come at the expense of marginalizing introverts. However, Rodriguez believed this was mostly unintentional and some introverts have been successfully able to bypass the \\"personality bias\\" with strong, creative ideas and hard work ethic. Regardless, a personality does exist which can lead to the oppression of introverts. Rodriguez took his research a step further and looked how personality bias differs among cultures. While Cain briefly touched on the subject in Quiet, Rodriguez felt further research and observation was needed. Rodriguez found that eastern cultures, particularly that of Hong Kong, China, had a personality bias for introversion. Unlike the U.S., China places more value on character and individual leadership. The good of organization or group, including the family, is much more important than individual desire and need. Being quite is seen as a symbol of wisdom, humility and selflessness. By contrast, extroversion can be viewed as a symbol arrogance and self-interest. Much like how the climate in the U.S. has marginalized introverts, the value of introversion in China has made difficult for extroverts to find respect and success. However, unlike the U.S. where this oppression is mostly unintentional, Rodriguez believes it is more deliberate in China as the culture has a spoken affliction towards extroverts. Rodriguez based much of his research in the concepts and ideas of other social scientific research and theory. In particular, Rodriguez used Muted Group Theory to see if temperaments can be muted/silenced much like other minority groups. While much less common and less extreme than with other minority groups based on sex and race, people of certain temperaments can indeed be muted by the dominant group, intentionally or unintentionally.  Formulation of a Formal Theory  Not long after his research into personality bias, Rodriguez began work on the formulation of a formal theory. Using Muted Group Theory as the basis and incorporating the findings and observations of his research, Rodriguez formally introduced Temperament Isolation Theory in his book Temperament Isolation: The Study of Personality Bias in Culture. Rodriguez used the term temperament in his theory to emphasize that it covers \\"overall personality\\" and not \\"individual traits and idiosyncrasies.\\" He also wanted to use temperament to emphasize that extroversion and introversion are not a measure of sociability but \\"other factors that have the potential to affect how one socializes.\\" The term isolation is also used to show that oppression is not always intentional. The theory suggests that certain temperaments, relative to culture, are inherently favored over others and this favoritism can often lead to the muting or oppression of opposite temperaments which can then make living in this culture challenging, impeding their success and acceptance of their beliefs, behaviors and values. Assumption of Temperament Isolation Theory: * Cultures are naturally inclined to favor certain temperaments. * Favoritism towards a temperament almost always results in the isolation of other temperaments, intentional or not. * Temperament refers to overall personality. * Temperaments are not a measure of sociability. * Temperaments are biologic and fixed from birth like race and sex. While personality bias is not viewed to be on the same scale as racial discrimination or sexism, Rodriguez argues that it is still a concern because temperament is biologically fixed like race and sex. While people may be able to adjust their behaviors and \\"mask\\" their true personalities but they cannot change their core temperament. If a person is introverted, they will always be introverted and vice versa. Rodriguez did not formulate Temperament Isolation to be a critical theory, but he acknowledges that it might address social inequality issues.  Expansion, Criticism and Future  Rodriguez plans to expand on the ideas of Temperament Isolation, particularly as it relates to other cultures. While most cultures can be divided into western and eastern, Rodriguez believes it may be more diverse than that. Rodriguez in particular wants to study Middle Eastern and South American cultures as he feels they don't quite align with the standard western and eastern distinctions. Rodriguez is also interested in researching the possibility of temperaments beyond introversion and extroversion. The idea of ambiversion is of particular interest as ambiverts are supposed to be sensory balanced. Temperament Isolation Theory is not currently accepted as formal social science theory. Many sociologists feel the theory needs more concrete concepts and empirical data. Rodriguez's research and observations are considered preliminary and many feel there needs to be more measurable results (qualitative and quantitative) to support the theory. In addition to preliminary nature of the theory, some sociologists suggest the idea of personality bias in itself is illogical. Critics feel Cain and Rodriguez are \\"over extending\\" by trying to suggest that discrimination or oppression of personality is similar to racial discrimination or sexism. In addition to Rodriguez's future research plans, other social scientists are exploring the idea of personality bias. Researchers like Janise Hoalburrough and Sean Greeson applied concepts of personality bias to workforce performance and success. Personality bias has also reinvigorated the study of personality and temperament by psychologists. Michelle Chavira recently published an article that explores new research in temperament and included some of Rodriguez's findings. Susan Cain is also continuing her \\"Quiet Revolution\\" where she attempts to empower introverts and help them find success.

Dick Co., 224 U.S. 1 (1912), was a 1912 decision of the United States Supreme Court that upheld patent licensing restrictions such as tie-ins on the basis of the so-called inherency doctrine—the theory that it was the inherent right of a patent owner, because he could lawfully refuse to license his patent at all, to exercise the \\"lesser\\" right to license it on any terms and conditions he chose.. In 1917, the Supreme Court overruled the A.B. Dick case in Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co.,. Background Patented Rotary Mimeograph machine of A.B. Dick Co. A.B. Dick owned a patent on a mimeograph machine, which was designed to print multiple paper copies of papers by exuding ink through apertures in a stencil onto paper sheets. Dick sold one of the patented machines to Miss Christina B. Skou. A plate had been fastened to the machine, reading that the machine was \\"sold by the A.B. Dick Company with the license restriction that it may be used only with the stencil, paper, ink, and other supplies made by A. B. Dick.\\" Sidney Henry then sold to Miss Skou a can of ink suitable for use upon the mimeograph machine, with knowledge of the license agreement, and with the expectation that she would use the ink with the machine.224 U.S. at 11-12, 26. A.B. Dick then sued Henry in the circuit court for the Southern District of New York, which ruled in favor of Dick.A.B. Dick Co. v. Henry, 149 Fed. 424 (C.C.S.D.N.Y. 1907). The Second Circuit certified to the Supreme Court the question whether the conduct constituted patent infringement. Ruling of Supreme Court The Court ruled (4-3) that Henry's conduct was contributory infringement, in a decision written by Justice Lurton, joined by Justices McKenna, Holmes, and Van Devanter. Chief Justice Edward White, joined by Justices Hughes and Lamar, dissented. (Two justices were unavailable: Justice Harlan had died and Justice Day was absent.). =Majority opinion= Justice Lurton Justice Lurton noted preliminarily that Henry could not be guilty of contributory infringement unless Skou was guilty of direct infringement in using Henry's ink. \\"It is not denied that she accepted the machine with notice of the conditions under which the patentee consented to its use. Nor is it denied that thereby she agreed not to use the machine otherwise.\\" 224 U.S. at 12. The only issue was whether breach of the agreement to use only Dick's ink was patent infringement. Henry argued that the exhaustion doctrine prevented such a post-sale restriction from being enforceable. \\"He cannot make a sale with the condition attached that the article shall be used or disposed of in a certain manner, leaving the title, however, in the purchaser in case of a breach of the condition.\\"224 U.S. at 18. The majority said that principle applied only to unconditional sales. This machine was sold subject to the condition that it must be used only with Dick's ink. \\"But if the right of use be confined by specific restriction, the use not permitted is necessarily reserved to the patentee. If that reserved control of use of the machine be violated, the patent is thereby invaded. This right to sever ownership and use is deducible from the nature of a patent monopoly, and is recognized in the cases.\\"224 U. S. at 24-25. The Court dismissed Henry's arguments that holding the licensing restrictions permissible would lead to great harm to the public: > For the purpose of testing the consequence of a ruling which will support > the lawfulness of a sale of a patented machine for use only its connection > with supplies necessary for its operation, bought from the patentee, many > fanciful suggestions of conditions which might be imposed by a patentee have > been pressed upon us. Thus, it is said that a patentee of a coffee pot might > sell on condition that it be used only with coffee bought from him, or, if > the article be a circular saw, that it might be sold on condition that it be > used only in sawing logs procured from him. These and other illustrations > are used to indicate that this method of marketing a patented article may be > carried to such an extent as to inconvenience the public and involve > innocent people in unwitting infringements. > > But these illustrations all fail of their purpose, because the public is > always free to take or refuse the patented article on the terms imposed. If > they be too onerous or not in keeping with the benefits, the patented > article will not find a market.224 U.S. at 34. The majority capped this argument by pointing out that under U.S. law the inventor may decline to exploit his patented invention and yet he can refuse to let others use it during the life of the patent, because that is his inherent right under our patent system: > This larger right embraces the lesser of permitting others to use upon such > terms as the patentee chooses to prescribe. It must not be forgotten that we > are dealing with a constitutional and statutory monopoly. . . . And if it be > that the ingenuity of patentees in devising ways in which to reap the > benefit of their discoveries requires to be restrained, Congress alone has > the power to determine what restraints shall be imposed. As the law now > stands, it contains none, and the duty which rests upon this and upon every > other court is to expound the law as it is written. Arguments based upon > suggestions of public policy not recognized in the patent laws are not > relevant. The field to which we are invited by such arguments is > legislative, not judicial.224 U.S. at 35 (emphasis supplied). =Dissenting opinion = Chief Justice White Chief Justice White expressed his \\"forebodings as to the evil consequences to result from the application of the construction now given to the patent statute\\" if Congress failed \\"to amend the statute so as to avoid such evils.\\"223 U.S at 50. He strongly objected to the doctrine \\"that a patentee, in selling the machine covered by his patent, has power by contract to extend the patent so as to cause it to embrace things which it does not include; in other words, to exercise legislative power of a far-reaching and dangerous character.224 U.S. at 51-52. This occurs, he said, because \\"the ruling now made in effect is that the patentee has the power, by contract, to extend his patent rights so as to bring within the claims of his patent things which are not embraced therein, thus virtually legislating by causing the patent laws to cover subjects to which, without the exercise of the right of contract, they could not reach.\\" 224 U.S. at 53. White then listed a catalog of dangerous results of the ruling: *Take a patentee selling a patented engine. He will now have the right by contract to bring under the patent laws all contracts for coal or electrical energy used to afford power to work the machine, or even the lubricants employed in its operation. *Take a patented carpenter's plane. The power now exists in the patentee by contract to validly confine a carpenter purchasing one of the planes to the use of lumber sawed from trees grown on the land of a particular person, or sawed by a particular mill. *Take a patented cooking utensil. The power is now recognized in the patentee to bind by contract one who buys the utensil to use in connection with it no other food supply but that sold or made by the patentee. *Take the invention of a patented window frame. It is now the law that the seller of the frame may stipulate that no other material shall be used in a house in which the window frames are placed except such as may be bought from the patentee and seller of the frame. *Take an illustration which goes home to everyone—a patented sewing machine. It is now established that, by putting on the machine, in addition to the notice of patent required by law, a notice called a license restriction, the right is acquired, as against the whole world, to control the purchase by users of the machine of thread, needles, and oil lubricants or other materials convenient or necessary for operation of the machine.224 U.S. at 55. White explained that these evils were not imaginary but were already becoming prevalent, as a result of the widespread following that had attached to the Sixth Circuit's decision in the Button-Fastener case:The Button-Fastener case, 77 Fed. 288 (6th Cir. 1896), was authored by Judge Lurton, as he then was, who was now a Supreme Court Justice and was the author of the majority opinion in this case. Neither majority nor dissenting opinion alludes to that fact, but both opinions cite that case. > The illustrations might be multiplied indefinitely. That they are not > imaginary is now a matter of common knowledge, for, as the result of a case > the Button-Fastener case decided some years ago by one of the circuit courts > of appeal, which has been followed by cases in other circuit courts of > appeal, to which reference will hereafter be made, what prior to the first > of those decisions on a sale of a patented article was designated a > condition of sale, governed by the general principles of law, has come in > practice to be denominated a license restriction. ...

White argued that this legal development was contrary to the exhaustion doctrine on which many earlier Supreme Court cases had been based, including Adams v. Burke.224 U.S. at 56-68. White maintained that the Button-Fastener case and the court of appeals decisions following it were all wrongly decided and should be overruled. \\"[T]he Button-Fastener case and the confusion which has followed the application of the ruling made in that case was but the consequence of failing to observe the difference between the rights of a patentee which were protected by the patent and those which arose from contract, and therefore were subject alone to the general law.\\"224 U.S. at 69. Subsequent developments The American Bar Ass'n's Intellectual Property Handbook asserts that the A.B. Dick decision \\"spurred congressional action\\" to pass section 3 of the Clayton Act in 1914, which prohibited tie-ins of patented or unpatented products when the effect was to substantially lessen competition in a market., 71–72 (2007). Two Supreme Court decisions failed to follow or distinguish A.B. Dick in 1912 and 1913 but did not overrule it.See id. at 72. The A.B., Dick case was overruled in 1917 in Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., The A.B. Dick case's reasoning that a sale on condition (i.e., the product was sold subject to a restriction on its use) was not within the exhaustion doctrine was revived in the Federal Circuit in Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc. That case apparently was overruled sub silentio in Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.. However, an en banc decision of the Federal Circuit refused to overrule Mallinckrodt and instead reaffirmed it. A certiorari petition is now pending in that case.Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Impression Prods., Inc.. Commentary In 1917, when the Motion Picture Patents case overruled A.B., Dick and the Button-Fastener case, a commentator remarked: > It by no means follows that because a patentee may withhold the use of the > patented article entirely he may license its use with any conditions he > chooses. It may be better that the public should not enjoy the article at > all than that it should be used under restrictions obnoxious to public > policy.Comment, Restraint of Trade: Common Law: Patents, 5 425, 428 (1917). In 2011, Professor Vincent Chiapetta explained this point in greater detail. He concluded that the inherency doctrine ignores the issue of whether the benefits of increased usage of the patented invention under a restrictive license exceed the harms resulting from the restriction. A proper legal analysis, Chiapetta argues, must balance benefits against harms.Vincent Chiapetta, Living with Patents: Insights from Patent Misuse, 15 1, 26-27 (2011(, The A.B. Dick case has been called \\"the high-water mark of judicial deference toward patentees.\\", 71 (2007).

The military nature of Mycenaean Greece (c. 1600–1100 BC) in the Late Bronze Age is evident by the numerous weapons unearthed, warrior and combat representations in contemporary art, as well as by the preserved Greek Linear B records.. The Mycenaeans invested in the development of military infrastructure with military production and logistics being supervised directly from the palatial centres. This militaristic ethos inspired later Ancient Greek tradition, and especially Homer's epics, which are focused on the heroic nature of the Mycenaean-era warrior élite. Late Bronze Age Greece was divided into a series of warrior kingdoms, the most important being centered in Mycenae, to which the culture of this era owes its name, Tiryns, Pylos and Thebes. From the 15th century BC, Mycenaean power started expanding towards the Aegean, the Anatolian coast and Cyprus. Mycenaean armies shared several common features with other contemporary Late Bronze Age powers: they were initially based on heavy infantry, with spears, large shields and in some occasions armor. In the 13th century BC, Mycenaean units underwent a transformation in tactics and weaponry and became more uniform and flexible and their weapons became smaller and lighter. Some representative types of Mycenaean armor/weapons were the boar's tusk helmet and the \\"Figure-of-eight\\" shield. Moreover, most features of the later hoplite panoply of Classical Greece were already known at this time. Military ethos Krater depicting marching soldiers, Mycenae, c. 1200 BC. The presence of the important and influential military aristocracy that formed in Mycenaean society offers an overwhelming impression of a fierce and warlike people. This impression of militarism is reinforced by the fortifications erected throughout Mycenaean Greece,.. the large numbers and quality of the weapons retrieved from the Mycenaean royal graves, artistic representations of war scenes and the textual evidence provided by the Linear B records... The Linear B scripts also offer some detail about the organization of the military personnel, while military production and logistics were supervised by a central authority from the palaces. According to the records in the palace of Pylos, every rural community (the damos) was obliged to supply a certain number of men who had to serve in the army; similar service was also performed by the aristocracy.. The main divinities who appear to be of warlike nature were Ares (Linear B: A-re) and Athena Potnia (Linear B: A-ta-na Po-ti-ni-ja).. Tactics and evolution Fresco depicting a \\"figure-of-eight\\" shield, Mycenae. Mycenaean armies shared several common features with other significant Late Bronze Age powers: they were initially based on heavy infantry, which bore pikes, large shields and, in some occasions, armor.. Later in the 13th century BC, Mycenaean warfare underwent major changes both in tactics and weaponry. Armed units became more uniform and flexible, while weapons became smaller and lighter. The spear remained the main weapon among Mycenaean warriors until the collapse of the Bronze Age, while the sword played a secondary role in combat. The precise role and contribution of war chariots in battlefield is a matter of dispute due to the lack of sufficient evidence.. In general, it appears that during the first centuries (16th–14th century BC) chariots were used as a fighting vehicle while later in the 13th century BC their role was limited to a battlefield transport.: \\"The history of Mycenaean chariot can be divided into two phases ... The second coincides with the period 1300–1200 BC (LH IIIB) when chariot design had changed dramatically with the development of the 'rail-chariot'. The shift from box-chariot to rail-chariot marks the transition from a purely mobile vehicle to a battlefield transport at a time when the Mycenaean world was in a state of fragmentation and dissolution.\\" Horse-mounted warriors were also part of the Mycenaean armies, however their precise role isn't clear due to lack of archaeological data.. Fortifications The construction of defensive structures was closely linked with the establishment of the palatial centers in mainland Greece. The principal Mycenaean centers were well-fortified and usually situated on an elevated terrain, such as in Athens, Tiryns and Mycenae or on coastal plains, in the case of Gla. Mycenaean Greeks appreciated the symbolism of war as expressed in defensive architecture, thus they aimed also at the visual impressiveness of their fortifications. The walls were built in Cyclopean style; consisted of walls built of large, unworked boulders more than thick and weighing several metric tonnes.. The term Cyclopean was derived by the Greeks of the classical era who believed that only the mythical giants, the Cyclops, could have constructed such megalithic structures.. On the other hand, cut stone masonry is used only in and around gateways.. Weaponry =Offensive weapons= Reconstructed Mycenaean swords. Spears were initially long and two-handed, more than long and possibly handled with both hands. During the later Mycenaean centuries, shorter versions were adopted which were usually accompanied with small types of shields, mainly of circular shape. These short spears have been used for both thrusting and throwing.. From the 16th century BC, swords with rounded tips appeared, having a grip which was an extension of the blade. They were long and broad.. Another type, the single- edged sword was a solid piece of bronze c. – long. This shorter sword was most probably used for close-quarters combat. In the 14th century BC, both types were progressively modified with stronger grips and shorter blades.. Finally in the 13th century BC, a new type of sword, the Naue II, became popular in Mycenaean Greece.. Archery was commonly used from an early period in battlefield.. Other offensive weapons used were maces, axes, slings and javelins.. =Shields= Boar's tusk helmets were typical of Mycenaean warfare. Early Mycenaean armies used \\"tower shields\\", large shields that covered almost the entire body. However, with the introduction of bronze armor, this type was less utilized, even if it didn't completely go into disuse, as attested in iconography.. \\"Figure-of-eight\\" shields became the most common type of Mycenaean shields. These shields were made of several layers of bull-hide and in some cases they were reinforced with bronze plates.. During the later Mycenaean period, smaller types of shields were adopted. They were either of completely circular shape, or almost circular with a cut-out part from their lower edge. These were made of several layers of leather with a bronze boss and reinforcements. They occasionally appear to have been made entirely of bronze. =Helmets= The most common type of Mycenaean helmet is the conical one reinforced with rows of boar tusks. This type was widely used and became the most identifiable piece of Mycenaean armor, being in use from the beginning to the collapse of Mycenaean culture. It is also known from several depictions in contemporary art in Greece and the Mediterranean. Boar's tusk helmets consisted of a felt-lined leather cap, with several rows of cut boar's tusk sewn onto it... Helmets made entirely of bronze were also used, while some of them had large cheek guards, probably stitched or riveted to the helmet, as well as an upper pierced knot to hold a crest. Small holes all around the cheek guards and the helmet's lower edge were used for the attachment of internal padding. Other types of bronze helmets were also used.. During the late Mycenaean period, additional types were also used such as horned helmets made of strips of leather.. =Armor= 14th century BC Dendra panoply. A representative piece of Mycenaean armor is the Dendra panoply (c. 1450–1400 BC) which consisted of a cuirass of a complete set made up of several elements of bronze.. It was flexible and comfortable enough to be used for fighting on foot,. while the total weight of the armor is around 18 kg (about 40 lb). Important evidence of Mycenaean armor has also been found in Thebes (c. 1350–1250 BC), which include a pair of shoulder guards, smaller than to those from Dendra, with additional plates protecting the upper arms, attached to the lower edge of the shoulder guards.. The use of scale armour is evident during the later Mycenaean centuries, as shown on iconography and archaeological finds.. In general, most features of the later hoplite panoply of classical Greek antiquity, were already known to Mycenaean Greece. Chariots Chariot depiction in a fresco from Pylos, c. 1350 BC. The two- horse chariot appeared on the Greek mainland at least from the 16th century BC.. Mycenaean chariots differed from their counterparts used by contemporary Middle Eastern powers. According to the preserved Linear B records, the palatial states of Knossos and Pylos were able to field several hundreds.. The most common type of Mycenaean chariot was the \\"dual chariot\\", which appeared in the middle of the 15th century BC.. In 14th century BC, a lighter version appeared, the \\"rail chariot\\", which featured an open cab and was most probably used as a battlefield transport rather than a fighting vehicle.. Ships Mycenaean ships were shallow-draught vessels and could be beached on sandy bays.. There were vessels of various sizes containing different numbers of oarsmen. The largest ship probably had a crew of 42–46 oarsmen, with one steering oar, a captain, two attendants and a complement of warriors.. The most common type of Mycenaean vessel based on depictions of contemporary art was the oared galley with long and narrow hulls. The shape of the hull was constructed in a way to maximize the number of rowers. Thus, a higher speed could have been achieved regardless of wind conditions. Although it carried mast and sail, it was less efficient as a sailing ship.. The Mycenaean galley offered certain advantages. Although lighter compared to the oared-sailing ship of the Minoans of Crete, it seated more rowers. Its steering mechanism was a triangular steering oar, a forerunner of the latter steering oar of Archaic era.. Campaigns Around 1450 BC, Greece was divided into a series of warrior kingdoms, the most important being centered in Mycenae, Tiryns, Pylos and Thebes. Before the end of the same century, this militaristic civilization replaced the former civilization of Minoan Cretans in the Aegean. Thus, the Mycenaeans began to build up their maritime power in the Aegean Sea, expanding towards the Aegean Islands and Anatolian coast.. The warlike nature of the Mycenaeans was probably a decisive factor in their diplomatic relations towards the other Late Bronze Age powers. Mycenaean warriors were also hired as mercenaries in foreign armies, such as in Egypt.. Contemporary Hittite texts indicate the presence of Ahhiyawa, which strengthened its position in western Anatolia from c. 1400 to c. 1220 BC.. Ahhiyawa is generally accepted as a Hittite translation of Mycenaean Greece (Achaeans in Homeric Greek)... During this period, the kings of Ahhiyawa were clearly able to deal with the Hittite kings both in a military and diplomatic way.. Ahhiyawa activity was to interfere in Anatolian affairs, with the support of anti-Hittite uprisings or through local vassal rulers, which the king of the Ahhiyawa used as agents for the extension of his influence.; . In one occasion, in c. 1400 BC, Attarsiya (a possible Hittite translation of Atreus) launched a campaign deploying an army headed by war chariots and attacked regions which were under Hittite influence. Later, Attarsiya, invaded the island of Alashiya (Cyprus) together with a number of his Anatolian allies.. The invading force finally succeeded in controlling the island and overthrowing the local Hittite authorities.. The campaigns of Attarsiya represent the earliest recorded Mycenaean Greek military activity against the Hittites.. The Hittite-Ahhiyawan confrontation in Wilusa, the Hittite name for Troy, in the 13th century BC may have provided the historical foundation for the Trojan War tradition.. In circa 1250 BC, the first wave of destruction has been witnessed in various centers of mainland Greece for reasons that cannot be identified by archaeologists.. These incidents appear to have triggered the massive strengthening and expansion of the fortifications in various sites. In some cases, arrangements were also made for the creation of subterranean passages which led to underground cisterns.. Nevertheless, none of these measures appear to have prevented the final destruction of the Mycenaean palace centers in the 12th century BC. The reasons that lead to the collapse of the Mycenaean culture have been hotly debated among scholars. The two most common theories are population movement and internal conflict.. Legacy Due to the information offered by the Greek epics and especially by Homer's epics, the Iliad and Odyssey, this time period of Greek history was regarded as a period of warrior-heroes who led various military campaigns in Greece and adjacent areas. The picture of the Mycenaean Greeks in the Homeric Epics is one of a quarrelsome people and of a warrior élite to whom personal honor was the highest value..

At the head of the center stands a brigadier-general rank officer. The center (named after the late Chief-of- Staff David \\"Dado\\" Elazar) is charged with the development of the military campaign learning approach based on the broad operational approach and its assimilation in the IDF, and with assisting the General Staff and top IDF commands (regional commands, ground forces, etc.) in implementing it. In so doing, the Dado Center deals with the development of the fundamentals of operational learning in the IDF, assistance to the commands in their learning and thinking processes, and preparing officers in relevant posts in these fields.  History  The Dado Center is rooted in the activities of MOTRI- Military Operational Theory Research Institute (\\"Maltam\\" – in its Hebrew acronym). The Maltam, which was founded by Brig-General (Res.) Dr. Shimon Naveh, Brig-General (Res.) Dov (Dovik) Tamari, and Dr. Zvi Lanir, operated in the IDF from the 1990s until the middle of the 2000s. The approach it advanced can be found, among other places, in Dr. Naveh's book, \\"Operational Art: The Emergence of Military Excellence,\\" published in 2001. At the beginning of 2007, the institute was reorganized under an active duty brigadier, Itai Brun, and its name was changed to \\"The Dado Center for Interdisciplinary Military Studies\\", after former chief of staff Lt.-Gen. David Elazar. New researchers were hired as civilian employees. Brun ran the center until 2011, when he was replaced by Brig.-Gen. Yoram Hamo, who served until 2014. Since then, Brig.-Gen. (Res.) Dr. Meir Finkel has headed the Dado Center.  Areas of activity  The Dado Center operates in three primary fields: * A center for learning processes which accompanies the IDF central thinking processes. In this role, it assists in methodology and content top bodies in the General Staff, heads of the regional commands, and the commanders of other top bodies in the IDF as they carry out processes of critical military analysis and development of strategies and tactics. * A school for the development of senior military leadership in operational thought. In this role, the center prepares senior officers for positions in the IDF General Staff, and runs targeted seminars to groups of officers on learning processes and operational thought, in order to develop new organizational and operational concepts. * A research institute that employs both civilian and military researchers for data mining and study of various subjects connected to the center's activities. As part of its activities, the center also runs wargames for senior commanders, joint learning seminars with foreign militaries, and joint day-long seminars between the IDF and academic bodies. Brig. Gen. Eran Ortal's Quote  Publications  As part of its role of developing learning approaches for the highest ranks in the IDF, the center develops and disseminates a series of internal professional manuals. Since February 2014, the center publishes a journal named \\"Bein Ha-ktavim\\" (\\"In between the Poles\\"), which is edited by COL Eran Ortal. The journal seeks to develop IDF's knowledge processes on new and developing phenomena that influence the DF. Each issue of \\"Bein Ha-ktavim\\" is dedicated to a different subject. The journal is published on-line in the Ma'arachot publishing website, and is distributed to senior IDF commanders, government officials, research institutes, relevant civil organizations, colleges and universities.

He was then a postdoc at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics, Toronto, 1989–91, a research fellow at the University of Michigan 1991-94 and a Prof. Research in the Physics Department at Princeton University 1994–96.  Research career  Hume has been a researcher in the study of the large-scale peculiar velocity field for the past two decades. His explanation of the systematic errors, aliasing and incomplete cancellations of small-scale noise masquerading as large-scale signal lead to the reemergence of peculiar velocities as a premier tool in our arsenal to probe the dynamics and statistics of the large-scale structure of the Universe. He developed a formalism to optimize the determination of cosmic flows from proper distance surveys and enabled for the first time direct comparison of independent surveys and cosmological models as a function of scale, thus establishing the cosmological significance of flow probes. His work has led to many widely cited results (such as a nearly 3-sigma flows on 100 Mpc/h scales),Richard Watkins, Hume A. Feldman & Michael J.

He worked extensively on the constraints on galaxy bias, matter density, and primordial non-Gaussianity in redshift surveys and his detection of the bispectrum signal was the first observational confirmation of the Gravitational Instability Model. He helped develop an artificial neural network formalism to interpolate the fully non- linear power spectrum of matter fluctuation and provided the community with a fast and accurate (<1% errors) software to determine the non-linear power spectrum given an input cosmology. His APS Fellow Citation reads:  Public activities  He travels widely for presentations to a diverse array of groups, from elementary to high school students to churches, interest groups, legislators and professional societies. He became involved in the Creationism/Intelligent Design in Kansas in 1999 when the nearly successful attempts of various fundamentalist groups to force the teaching of religion in public schools began in earnest. Hume was one of the leaders of a group of academics and educators that addressed, publicized and confronted the issue head on by organizing conferences, public forums and workshops, and through political advocacy including testimonials to the Kansas legislatures, providing high school science teachers with the tools and knowledge to discuss these issues locally to parents, students and the interested public.

It is somewhat analogous to the structure factor in solid-state physics, and the form factor (quantum field theory). The nucleon (proton and neutron) electromagnetic form factors describe the spatial distributions of electric charge and current inside the nucleon and thus are intimately related to its internal structure; these form factors are among the most basic observables of the nucleon. (Nucleons are the building blocks of almost all ordinary matter in the universe. The challenge of understanding the nucleon's structure and dynamics has occupied a central place in nuclear physics.)

The album will be released through G-Unit Records and Caroline Distribution. Initially reported to be released during the summer of 2011, the release date of Street King Immortal has since been revised on several occasions. Officially announced release dates of November 13, 2012; February 26, 2013; and August 18, 2016 have been set in the past, though the album remains currently unreleased. In July 2017, 50 Cent stated that the album would be released in the end of the year; this did not occur. 50 Cent said on a Instagram post that \\"Still Think I'm Nothing\\" is the first single off of Street King Immortal. As of 2020, Street King Immortal has yet to be released. Background 50 Cent performing on The Invitation Tour in 2010. Originally, 50 Cent's fifth studio album was set to be Black Magic, an album influenced by several genres including rock and dance music. However, its release was postponed as 50 Cent began to write more material based on a different concept. As a result, recording sessions for a brand new album began from scratch, and material recorded for Street King Immortal is reportedly of a traditional hip hop nature, involving producers such as Alex da Kid, Bangladesh, Cardiak, Dr. Dre, Hit-Boy, Jake One, Jim Jonsin, and Just Blaze among others. It was later reported that the album would be titled 5 (Murder by Numbers), and would be released on July 3, 2012. 50 Cent instead decided to make 5 (Murder by Numbers) a separate album, to be released as a free download on July 6, 2012, and release a new collection of material as his sixth studio album, titled Street King Immortal: In November 2009, 50 Cent released his fourth studio album, titled Before I Self Destruct. The album did not match the previous commercial success of his first three studio albums, only selling 160,000 copies in its first week of release in the United States, peaking at number five on the Billboard 200. To help promote the album, 50 Cent went on The Invitation Tour; while on the European leg of the tour, he visited nightclubs and was impressed with the vastly changing styles of music played. Because of this, 50 Cent began to write and record material for an album called Black Magic while still on tour. This new album's music would be influenced by number of genres, including dance, rock and pop music; it would have a \\"higher tempo\\" than his previous work, although he claimed that the predominant genre of the music would still be hip hop. However, 50 Cent later revealed to the Brazilian edition of music magazine Rolling Stone that he was unsure whether to continue with the recording of the album, which he had begun while in the European venues of the tour, as he had begun to write material that he claimed \\"didn't quite fit the concept\\" of the album. He later revealed the release of Black Magic had been postponed indefinitely, although he stated the album may be released in the future. Street King Immortal will be more hip hop-influenced than the material recorded for Black Magic, which was inspired and influenced by a number of genres. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, 50 Cent announced that he would never release the album Black Magic, as it no longer makes sense to do so: In an interview with MTV, 50 Cent discouraged fans from comparing Street King Immortal to his debut studio album Get Rich or Die Tryin. In the same interview, 50 Cent revealed the album's release date and said it would not be changed again, as it will serve as a commemoration of the tenth anniversary of Get Rich or Die Tryin: 50 Cent confirmed in an interview with British hip-hop music television channel Flava, aired on January 3, 2012, that he had recorded seventy songs for the album, and only fourteen would make the final cut. In early January 2013 Street King Immortal was included on multiple \\"Most Anticipated albums of 2013\\" lists including E!, MTV and being eleventh on a list by XXL Magazine. On January 25, 2013, 50 Cent announced that he is still recording material for the album in an interview with Fuse. In January 2014, 50 Cent said he plans on a releasing a project called Animal Ambition in the first quarter of 2014 before the album comes out. He wanted to release the project as his \\"viral marketing plan\\" in order to hype up Street King Immortal. However a month later it was announced that the Animal Ambition LP would instead be released on June 3, 2014. In June 2014, 50 Cent announced the album would be released on September 16, 2014. However, it yet has to be released. Development =Recording and production= In November 2010, in an interview with MTV News, Surf Club producers Hit-Boy and Chase N. Cashe revealed that they had contributed production work for Street King Immortal. Hit-Boy revealed that they had visited 50 Cent to play him a selection of their productions and hear \\"where he was going with it\\". He went on to talk positively about the album's material and its musical variation: Whilst attending the Sundance Film Festival on January 25, 2011, 50 Cent revealed to MTV News that \\"80 percent\\" of the album had been recorded, and also revealed that he had recorded material for the album with record producers Boi-1da, Alex da Kid and Symbolyc One. In an interview in March 2011 with online blogger DDotOmen, record producer Cardiak revealed that he had produced a song for the album called \\"Outlaw\\", which was later released to several digital outlets to promote the album. On April 8, 2011, MTV Mixtape Daily reported that producer Jim Jonsin had been involved in the album's recording sessions. In an interview with Rap- Up on May 13, 2011, American rapper Soulja Boy revealed that 50 Cent had requested several productions from him for the album whilst the pair were in California the previous month, and that he had given him roughly five of these productions to record over. He also claimed that 50 Cent had played him all of the material recorded for the album at the time, and was impressed with the material, stating that \\"His album was kinda dope. I ain't gonna lie to you. That's my big bro and all that. I got love for him. He's got some good stuff on there\\". In an appearance with singer Nicole Scherzinger on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, hosted by comedian and actress Ellen DeGeneres, on May 24, 2011, 50 Cent and Scherzinger performed their single \\"Right There\\", and 50 Cent revealed that the album was only a single song away from completion. He also confirmed that the mixing process for the album had already begun. 50 Cent later elaborated on Boi-1da's contribution in an interview with DJ Whoo Kid on the hip-hop radio station Shade 45, when he revealed that Boi-1da had produced two potential songs for the album. In the same interview, he revealed that producer Just Blaze had contributed two song productions for the album. In September 2011, 50 Cent revealed that he had finished recording material for the album, although it still had to be mixed. He later confirmed Dr. Dre's involvement with Street King Immortal, claiming that he had produced two of the songs on the album. Hip hop producer DJ Felli Fel also revealed that he had produced a song for the album called \\"Lighters\\", featuring Chris Brown. He stated that he had wanted the collaboration to occur as 50 Cent and Brown had not previously appeared together on a song. 50 Cent confirmed in a radio interview with Power 92.3, that J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League and Drumma Boy produced songs for the album 5 (Murder by Numbers). However the tracks didn't appear on the free album and were saved for Street King Immortal. 50 Cent confirmed some more producers for the album, who include Jake One, Bangladesh, Dr Dre – who had already produced the first single for the album – and several more. On December 4, 2012, with magazine Billboard, 50 revealed that another producer on the album is Frank Dukes. While promoting his Animal Ambition LP 50 spoke on SKI coming out later in the year, \\"It's gonna ride right into it. Street King Immortal is more personal. It's way more personal than this record. Of course this one is about a portion of my actual experience, but that one is...I talk about things that I haven't talked about.\\" =Guest appearances= Although a confirmed track listing for the album is yet to emerge, several other recording artists have been reported to be appearing on the album. On January 24, 2011, Rap-Up reported that fellow rapper and longtime collaborator Eminem would appear on the album, along with Lil' Kim, Akon, Swizz Beatz, Busta Rhymes, and former G-Unit member Lloyd Banks. In the aforementioned interview on Shade 45, 50 Cent elaborated on Eminem's contributions to the album, revealing that he would appear on four songs. He also stated that the songs were designed to appear to various audiences: two of the songs were referred to as \\"definite singles\\", and the other two were described as created to appeal to his \\"core audience\\", as well as being \\"more aggressive\\" and having a \\"different kind of energy\\". On July 11, 2011, while on the set of the video for the Tony Yayo song \\"Haters\\", 50 Cent revealed that New Orleans rapper Kidd Kidd, formerly of Young Money Entertainment but now of G-Unit Records, would appear on the album's title track. Chris Brown's contribution to the album was elaborated upon when DJ Felli Fel revealed that he would be on a song titled \\"Lighters\\". Black Hippy member Schoolboy Q stated that in addition to having a good rapport with 50 Cent, the two had done multiple collaborations, which could be featured on the album. On June 29, 2012 the G-Unit Philly rapper Mike Knox tweeted that he was in the studio with 50 Cent and Alicia Keys. Later the lead single featuring her and Dr. Dre was released . In an interview with DJ Whoo Kid on Shade 45 for his birthday, 50 Cent confirmed an upcoming song with Young Jeezy. 50 also stated that he wished to work with Kanye West, adding him to the list of possible featured guests. Drake shouted out 50 Cent while performing at a concert on the latter's birthday. He also talked about his work plans with 50 Cent, making a collaboration between the two rappers possible. 50 Cent stated that he wanted to work with Rihanna and Frank Ocean, in an interview with Digital Spy, making two more appearances possible. On August 2, 2012 the website of magazine Complex confirmed that there would be appearances from Adam Levine, Chris Brown and Eminem. 50 Cent confirmed in an interview with Global Grind, that he had selected one track of the four he had recorded with Eminem for inclusion on the album. He also stated that another collaboration between them for a bonus track was possible, with Eminem later saying there are multiple tracks on the album that feature both of them. 50 Cent, on September 21, 2012, in an interview with the radio station KDON-FM, confirmed appearances by Eminem, Chris Brown, Ne-Yo and Trey Songz among a list of other guest appearances. In the interview 50 Cent also commented about his new business ventures, the Street King Energy Drink, SMS Audio headphones line and his new upcoming fitness book, Formula 50: On December 4, 2012, 50 Cent's official news website listed more guests for the album, including Wiz Khalifa and the already announced Eminem, Alicia Keys, Ne-Yo and Trey Songz. In an interview with Fuse he announced a guest appearance from GOOD Music artist John Legend. 50 Cent also used Twitter to reveal a collaboration with Kendrick Lamar for the album. On February 16, 2015, 50 Cent on a Shade 45 radio interview with G-Unit said that he recorded more tracks with Chris Brown for his album. 50 Cent also featured on Chris Brown and Tyga's album Fan of a Fan: The Album which was recorded earlier in the year. Drake has a verse on one of the tracks on the album.  Composition  = Music and influence = While recording Street King Immortal, 50 Cent listened to a mix of music performed by his favourite artists, including rappers Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G.. In an interview with the Detroit Free Press, 50 Cent explained these actions, stating, \\"I listen to those records to create expectations... It creates a level to me, within myself, of how good the record has to be before I'm ready to launch it.\\" In the same interview, he described the album as a \\"whole new sound\\" for him and felt that it was \\"more soulful\\" and \\"more mature\\" than his previous work. 50 Cent reported, on March 16, 2012, that he believes Street King Immortal will be better than his most successful studio album to date, Get Rich or Die Tryin'. Explaining, he said he had repeatedly listened to the album, and believed it wasn't better than Street King Immortal. On October 17, 2012, 50 Cent mentioned the concept of the album, saying it would be based on its title. When asked about the main theme of it, he said: He elaborated on this saying Street King Immortal will be his most insightful album. Release and promotion During his appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on May 24, 2011, 50 Cent revealed that Street King Immortal was one song from completion and being mixed, and he expected to release it as early as summer 2011, stating: \\"This summer they'll have new music from me\\". However, due to 50 Cent's various disputes with Interscope Records over the promotion and release of the album, including the leakage of several songs intended for the album, the album's release was briefly cancelled by 50 Cent himself, before being rescheduled to November 2011, when it was to be released in conjunction with his headphone line Sleek by 50. The album was then set to be released on July 3, 2012, when it was still believed to be 5 (Murder by Numbers), however, he later decided to make \\"5 (Murder by Numbers)\\" as a separate free album, and release a new collection of songs titled \\"Street King Immortal\\" as his official fifth studio album in November 2012 instead. Shady Records president Paul Rosenberg announced in February 2013 that Street King Immortal would be released in the first half of 2013. However the album would again be delayed due to staff changes at Interscope Records. 50 Cent has been working on the album since 2010. It has been pushed back several times, with the first release date set for November 13, 2012, then February 26, 2013, and finally September, 2015. In July 2013, 50 Cent opened up about the long delay in an interview with MTV saying: \\"I don't really need the money off of the record. I want the record to be right. I'm not doing it without a plan; I'm not putting it out like that.\\" He also explained that he needed the support of Interscope Records in order to move forward with the project. \\"It's a lot of staff changes, a lot of different people moving in and moving out, so you got to kind of wait until everything's right; until it's settled in.\\" =Interscope Records tensions= Steve Baughman, music producer, engineer and mixer, assumed mixing duties on the album, as he has with past 50 Cent albums. Street King Immortal was set to be 50 Cent's final release on his current contract at Interscope Records, originally signed when he joined the label in 2002, as the contract requires him to release five albums with the label. However, there have been tensions between 50 Cent and the label throughout the album's recording process. The first reports of disagreement between the label and 50 Cent emerged on June 16, 2011, when 50 Cent released a series of messages through his account on Twitter: he explained that Interscope Records were disputing with him over the album's recording process, and claimed he would delay the album's release until the dispute was resolved. He also stated that the album would not be released during 2011. The issues with Interscope intensified when a song called \\"I'm On It\\", produced by The Cataracs, leaked onto the Internet on July 27, 2011 ahead of its intended release date. 50 Cent blamed Interscope Records for the leakage, and, as he had intended to release the song as the album's next single, revealed through Twitter on July 28, 2011 that he would retaliate against the label by cancelling the release of album. He also revealed that he planned threatening to leak the single from the Dr. Dre album Detox, \\"The Psycho\\", in which he is featured. He later clarified his comments, revealing that he was willing to collaborate with other artists during his remaining time at the label, but confirmed that he would not release another album with the label because \\"[Interscope] dropped the ball with me one time too [sic] many\\". However, he later retracted these statements, and apologized to Jimmy Iovine, head of Interscope Records, and also to Dr. Dre for threatening to leak \\"The Psycho\\", as he stated that the pair of them had been supportive of his career throughout his time at the label. After his statements were retracted, 50 Cent later announced that the album's release date had been rescheduled to November 2011. In an interview with MTV News on June 22, 2011, 50 Cent revealed that the incident had left him unsure as to whether to resign to Interscope once his five-album contract with the label ended, upon the release of Street King Immortal: Despite these comments, 50 Cent confirmed that it was not certain that he would leave Interscope after the release of the album, admitting that problems with finding a suitable alternative label would be difficult: \\"If not [signed to a label], if you don't have that support, why would you want to sign to another system?\\". In an interview with AllHipHop, 50 Cent revealed that he would release the album regardless of whether Interscope wished to promote it or not. He later confirmed on Twitter the release date to be on July 3, just 3 days before his birthday. He also uploaded the cover for this album as a preview for his fans on June 15 via Instagram and posted the link onto Twitter. The album was released under the name of \\"5 Murder By Numbers\\" as a free download. He later confirmed he will be releasing a proper album in stores later and this was just a free album for the fans to listen to.

He is the current world record holder for the number of pull-ups completed in 24 hours (5,804) while wearing a 30 lb pack. He is the founder of the Twelve Labors Project, a philanthropic organization in which McCastle performs feats of strength and endurance to raise awareness for causes. McCastle is also a petty officer in the United States Navy. Endurance feats McCastle attempted his first endurance feat in 2014 when he sought to break the world record for the most pull-ups completed in a 24-hour period. He decided to attempt the feat while recovering from an ACL injury suffered in Naval Special Warfare Preparatory School portion of the Navy SEALs training pipeline. The 24-hour pull-up record at the time of McCastle's first attempt was 4,030. After he had completed around 2,300, McCastle suffered muscle tears in his forearms and biceps as well as rhabdomyolysis. He managed to finish 3,202 pull-ups in 19 hours before quitting due to injury. He spent two days in the hospital recovering. Through this feat, McCastle helped raise $9,600 for the Wounded Warrior Project. His next feat took place in December 2014 and involved flipping a 250-pound truck tire 13 miles, attempting the feat one day after he lost his father. The initial plan was for McCastle to flip the tire along a 13-mile stretch of road where he was stationed Oak Harbor, Washington. He could not secure the requisite municipal permits for the journey and ended up flipping the tire in a parking lot. The stretch of pavement was 500 feet, and McCastle flipped the tire across that stretch 137 times to equal 13 miles. The feat took around 10 hours to complete. In the process, McCastle raised $700 for the Wounded Warrior Project. The feat is generally considered a world record for the longest distance traveled while flipping a 250-pound truck tire. In May 2015, McCastle successfully climbed 29,029 feet (the equivalent of climbing to the top of Mount Everest) by scaling a 20-foot rope 1,450 times in under 27 hours. McCastle's goal was to raise $20,000 for the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research. McCastle had lost his father to Parkinson's a few months earlier. Prior to the rope climb, McCastle also completed a 50k run for cancer research. In September 2015, McCastle announced that he would be attempting the 24-hour pull-up record again. During this attempt, McCastle wore a 30-pound pack on his back to represent the burden of wounded soldiers. This feat was performed to raise funds and awareness for Operation Enduring Warrior, a charity and advocacy group for wounded soldiers. McCastle surpassed the record of 5,801 pull-ups by three reps and is the current world record holder at 5,804 pull-ups in a 24-hour period. Personal life McCastle was driven to join the Navy after the September 11 attacks. He has been deployed around the world and currently works as an air traffic controller at the Naval Air Station Whidbey Island in Washington, with a rank of petty officer, first class. He is also the founder of the Twelve Labors Project, which is named in reference to the Twelve Labors of Hercules. The organization's goal is to raise awareness and funds for a variety of causes through the completion of various feats of strength and endurance.

According U.S. News and World Report, Louisiana's education system ranks 48th out of all 50 states in the nation. A Republican from Alexandria, Jones was elected to the District 5 seat for primarily northeastern and Central Louisiana in the primary held on October 24, 2015. Background Born in a military family in Washington state, Jones himself served for 37 years in the military, in both the United States Army and the United States Navy. He reached the rank of brigadier general in the Louisiana Army National Guard, of which he was a member from 1976 to 2006. Jones obtained his Bachelor of Arts, Master of Education, and Ed.D. from the University of Louisiana at Monroe. He engaged in Strategic Studies from the U.S. Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, all dates unavailable. Career From 1971 to 1999, Jones was employed by the city school system in Monroe in Ouachita Parish, which he considers his hometown. From 1999 to 2003, he was superintendent for the Claiborne Parish School Board in Homer. From 2003 to 2012, he was superintendent for the Rapides Parish School Board in Alexandria, where he still resides. In 2011, he was named \\"Superintendent of the Year\\" by the American Association of School Administrators and the Louisiana Association of School Executives. In Rapides Parish, Jones turned around an $11 million school deficit into a $14 million surplus by what he calls \\"targeting\\" resources: \\"A lot of money comes through our district. I just try to put it where it will get the best results.\\" Jones said that as superintendent he worked with troubled students to keep them out of trouble with the law: \\"I get personally involved with troubled students. Instead of getting expelled, such students meet with Jones to sign a performance contract. We negotiate a contract between the student and me, and then we both agree to live up to it.\\" In the 2009–2010 school year, Jones was the president of the Louisiana Association of School Superintendents. From 2012 to June 2015, he was the assistant state education superintendent for policy implementation in Baton Rouge under John C. White. Since July 2015, he has been an educational consultant. In his race for the BESE seat, incumbent Republican Jay Guillot, an engineer with the firm Hunt Guillot & Associates LLC of Ruston, did not seek a second term. Jones instead defeated another Republican, Johnnie Ray Fatheree (born February 1953) of Downsville in Union Parish, a businessman who formerly studied at the University of Louisiana at Monroe. Jones polled 77,301 votes (62.3 percent) to Fatheree's 46,863 (37.7 percent). The district encompasses these nineteen parishes, some of small population: Caldwell, Catahoula, Claiborne, Concordia, East Carroll, Evangeline, Franklin, Grant, Jackson, LaSalle, Lincoln, Madison, Morehouse, Ouachita, Rapides, Richland, Tensas, Union, and West Carroll. Neither Jones nor Fatheree reported having any campaign contributions for the race. Prior to the election, however, Jones received $35,000 from four political action committees. James Garvey, Jr., who won a third term in District 1 in suburban New Orleans, reported the most assets prior to the 2015 primary election. Jones said that he expects the controversial Common Core State Standards to be phased out in Louisiana with the establishment of academic standards in mathematics and English by the individual states. As an incoming BESE member, he vowed to work for higher standards in Louisiana: \\"A kid should not get condemned to a lower quality education because of his zip code.\\" Jones indicated that he prefers a series of informal teacher evaluations, rather than one annual formal evaluation. He also supports merit pay. Since joining BESE, Jones has faced continuing issues regarding Common Core and the status of the employment of State Superintendent John White who was given a positive annual review by the board in 2017, but he has not had an official contract since 2016. As Jones noted, the board lacks the 6/11 vote to place Jones under a renewed contract, and it lacks the same vote required to dismiss him. Jones said that he has generally supported White: \\"He has done some good things for Louisiana. I know there are folks that won't agree with that statement, but I look at it, I haven't always agreed with everything he did, but on balance, I have to (acknowledge that).\\" Jones said that the future focus of BESE must be on school accountability: \\"What I have become a big fan of is parents having opportunities.\\" References Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:People from Washington (state) Category:University of Louisiana at Monroe alumni Category:Louisiana Republicans Category:Educators from Louisiana Category:American school superintendents Category:Members of the Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education Category:People from Alexandria, Louisiana Category:People from Homer, Louisiana Category:People from Monroe, Louisiana Category:People from Baton Rouge, Louisiana Category:United States Army officers Category:United States Navy officers Category:United States Army War College alumni ","title":"Gary Jones (Louisiana politician)"},{"id":"48408304","text":"Visions: How Science Will Revolutionize the 21st Century is a popular science book by Michio Kaku first published in 1997.

It is a white solid chemical with a slight aromatic smell. It is soluble in water and also in organic solvents.http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi- bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+7271 Mode of action Tebufenpyrad is a strong mitochondrial complex I inhibitor. Like Rotenone, it inhibits electron transport chain by inhibiting the complex I enzymes of mitochondria which ultimately leads to lack of ATP production and finally cell death. Use Tebufenpyrad is used mainly in greenhouses around the world. It has been registered under various trade names (i.e.Masai, Pyranica) in countries like Australia, China and certain South American countries. It is registered in USA for use on ornamental plants in commercial green houses. The data available presented enough evidence to support unconditional registration of tebufenpyrad for use on ornamental plants in greenhouses. Exposure and toxicity It is mainly used in greenhouses and the major form of exposure is through occupational exposure where this chemical is manufactured or used extensively. The possible routes of exposure are through inhalation or dermal exposure. Since it is used in ornamental plants the exposure through food is limited. The LD 50 values for various laboratory animals are as follows: LD50 Rat (male) oral 595 mg/kg LD50 Rat (female) oral 997 mg/kg LD50 Mouse (male) oral 224 mg/kg LD50 Mouse (female) oral 210 mg/kg LD50 Rat dermal >2000 mg/kgMacBean C, ed. Tebufenpyrad (119168-77-3). In: The e-Pesticide Manual, 15th Edition, Version 5.0.1 (2011-2012). Surrey UK, British Crop Protection Council Biotransformation Hydroxylation is the major and primary biotransformation of tebufenpyrad reported both in vivo and in vitro. Ethyl and tetra-butyl groups are the targets of hydroxylation. The alcohol groups are oxidized to carboxylic groups which can then be conjugated with other groups in vivo. In rodent studies it was shown that 80% of the pesticide was absorbed mainly in the digestive system within 24 hours, the major metabolites being the hydroxylated forms. Most of the compound and its metabolites were excreted through feces and urine. There was no evidence of accumulation in the body of the rodents. The metabolites excreted out differed from male to female in rodents. While males excreted the carboxylic derivatives of the parent compound, the female rats excreted the sulfate conjugates of carboxylic acid. The LD50 values of male and female rats was very different. While the LD50 value of female rats was 997 mg/kg the LD50 for male rats was only 595 mg/kg. This vast difference in LD 50 value might be attributed to this biotransformation. Consequences of exposure Tebufenpyrad exposure has been linked to cancer but to date no human data has been conclusive enough to link the two.USEPA Office of Pesticide Programs, Health Effects Division, Science Information Management Branch: \\"Chemicals Evaluated for Carcinogenic Potential\\" (April 2006) Recently this pesticide has been shown to affect the dopaminergic neuronal cell lines N27 by disrupting the mitochondrial dynamics. Loss of dopaminergic cells have been linked to Parkinson's disease in which the neuronal mitochondria are affected. These findings may show that tebufenpyrad might also be able to affect the neurons. Overexposure of the pesticide has also led to the development of resistance among different target organisms. Recent studies have detected tebufenpyrad resistance in two spider mite species in apple trees in Western Australia.

Lanterman (November 4, 1901 – April 29, 1981) was a California State Assemblyman from 1950–1978. He was known for authoring the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Act. Biography He was the grandson of the co- founder of La Cañada Flintridge, Jacob Lanterman. During his lifetime, he was a theater organist, a Republican activist, a real estate developer and a water company manager, as well as a politician. He also mentored many young politicians. One of his first jobs was playing the organ at the Alexander Theatre in Glendale, California for four years.Sadler, Jo Anne. Crescenta Valley Pioneers & Their Legacies. Charleston, SC: History Press, 2012. In 1928, he went to Melbourne, Australia, where he became an organist at the State Theatre, where he remained for two years. He was also involved in Civil Defense work and served as an Air Raid Warden and Instructor for the Los Angeles County Civil Defense and Disaster Commission during World War II. He studied organ, piano and composition at the University of Southern California. Although he did not formally graduate from the university, he was given an honorary degree in Law. Political career Frank Lanterman was elected to the California State Assembly in 1950 and was reelected to serve for fourteen consecutive terms. His original 48th Assembly District included Pasadena, South Pasadena, La Cañada Flintridge, La Crescenta, Montrose, and North Glendale. The author of approximately 400 bills, Lanterman sponsored groundbreaking legislation affecting issues such as water, transportation, noise and air pollution, and the needs of the aging and developmentally disabled. During his time in office, he served on the Committee on Municipal and County Government, the Transportation Committee, and the Budget Committee. His work with the transportation committee led to the naming of a portion of the upper Glendale freeway (2) as the Frank Lanterman Freeway. He was the co- author of amendments to the 1911 Municipal Water District Act that allowed for the creation of the Foothill Municipal Water District serving the communities of La Cañada Flintridge, La Crescenta, and Altadena. At the time, all were unincorporated communities that would otherwise have been forced to annex themselves to surrounding cities if they wanted to receive water from the Metropolitan Water District. He also provided legislative relief for cities impacted economically by freeway projects. In 1955, Frank Lanterman sponsored Assembly Bill 3574 requiring motor vehicles to be equipped with an approved pollution-reducing muffler. By 1960, he was supporting a bill requiring the installation of anti-smog devices on all motor vehicles. As a result, by 1966, California became the first state in the nation to have motor vehicle emission standards, leading to requirements for pollution controls. He was especially known for his work relating to mental health and the rights of the handicapped.Bardach, Eugene.(1977). \\"The Implementation Game: What Happens after a Bill Becomes a Law\\", p.9-17,89-99. MIT Press. Cambridge. Lanterman was instrumental in the passage of the Short–Doyle Act of 1957 which created a system of community-based mental health services and provided the funding and structure to improve care and encourage deinstitutionalization. By the time of Lanterman's retirement in 1978, the number of patients in state mental hospitals was just 6,000, one-sixth of the 1957 total. The Lanterman-Petris- Short Act of 1969, authored by Frank Lanterman, Nicholas Petris, and Alan Short, gave persons with developmental disabilities the right to get the services and support they needed to live like people without disabilities. It established regional centers so that disabled Californians could get the help they needed while living at home or on their own. In 1972, the Act was expanded to include persons with cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism, and other neurological disabilities. One of the regional centers in Southern California was renamed in the 1970s as the Frank D. Lanterman Regional Center in honor of his efforts. Frank Lanterman also authored legislation to implement California's Master Plan for Special Education, which expanded educational opportunities for the handicapped. Prior to the adoption of the Plan, children with disabilities could be denied access to a public education. The last bill he sponsored before his retirement in 1978 would have provided free care for pregnant women whose children might be born mentally ill or physically handicapped; it was vetoed by Governor Jerry Brown, whom Lanterman called \\"the jerry-built governor\\" or merely \\"Junior.\\" Frank Lanterman's numerous public contributions to the state inspired such nicknames for him as \\"Mr. California,\\" \\"The Sage of the Assembly,\\" and \\"The Workhorse of Sacramento.\\" Personal life Frank Lanterman never married and lived for sixteen years at the Senator Hotel in Sacramento with occasional visits back to his home in La Cañada, California. He had a favorite brown suit which he wore week in and week out until, one day, it became so threadbare that it had to be replaced. The next day, Lanterman entered the Assembly wearing checked trousers and a navy blazer. At the close of the session, the speaker announced, \\"We close this session in memory of Frank Lanterman’s brown suit.\\" When he retired in 1978, Lanterman was third on the Assembly's seniority list. Frank Lanterman was very active in his hometown of La Cañada Flintridge, California. He was involved with the La Cañada Congregational Church (formerly the Church of the Lighted Window) and its musical program. He also helped start the La Cañada Valley Chamber of Commerce in 1938 as a successor to the original LC Valley Improvement Association that had been formed in 1912. Frank Lanterman was honored as La Cañada's Citizen of the Year in 1959. His La Cañada home, the Lanterman House, is a historic site listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1995. It is open to visitors several days a week throughout the year.

Using an 1879 copy of Appleton's Guidebook to the railroads of the United States and Canada, Portillo travels across the United States and Canada primarily by train, though at times using other forms of transportation where necessary. On his journeys, he makes stops to learn how places, events and people, and the railroads of the 19th century influenced the country's growth into a major superpower. When originally broadcast, each series consisted of 30-minute episodes, shown on consecutive weekday evenings. , 4 series of the programme have been broadcast since its debut on 1 February 2016. Episodes =Series 1 (2016)= In his first series, Portillo took two railroad journeys in the north-east of the United States, spanning a total of 15 episodes. His first journey took him across the US State of New York, travelling around New York City and Long Island before heading to Niagara Falls via New York's state capital of Albany and Buffalo. His second journey took him across the Mid-Atlantic States of Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia, travelling from Philadelphia to Jamestown, via Washington, D.C.. Series 1 was repeated later in the year in a revised schedule (described as \\"Reversions\\") which combined and re-edited two episodes of the original broadcasts to create a series of 1-hour episodes; as series 1 consisted of fifteen 30-minute episodes, the \\"Brooklyn to Montauk\\" episode was revised as an extended version that included additional content not seen in the original broadcast schedule.

New York City to Niagara Falls Philadelphia to Jamestown =Series 2 (2017)= In his second series, Portillo took two railroad journeys around the midwestern and central regions of the United States, spanning a total of 20 episodes. His first recreated the experience that would have been felt by those travelling across the 19th century American Frontier, beginning in St. Louis, Missouri and travelling towards Kansas City, Dodge City, Colorado Springs, Albuquerque, and finishing at the Grand Canyon. His second focused on discovering how the modern Midwest was made, beginning in the Twin Cities and following the Mississippi River, before heading towards Chicago, and then turning back southwards towards Minneapolis, eventually rejoining the Mississippi at the finishing point at Memphis. St. Louis, Missouri to the Grand Canyon The Twin Cities to Memphis =Series 3 (2018)= =Series 4 (2020)= This is a re-edited version of Great Alaskan Railroad Journeys and Great Canadian Railway Journeys (both first shown in early 2019), with two of the original 30-minute episodes merged, plus scenes not previously shown, to produce each 60-minute programme. The titles in the opening sequences are unaltered, except for episode 3, for which the final episode of Great Alaskan Railroad Journeys was integrated with the 6th episode of Great Canadian Railway Journeys under the title Great Alaskan & Canadian Railway Journeys. Subsequent 30-minute episodes from Great Canadian Railway Journeys were combined in pairs, thus: 7+8, 9+10, 1+2, 3+4, 5+11, 12+13, 14+15.

Bastian is an American medical doctor and neuropathologist, who previously worked at Louisiana State University, moved to a university in New Orleans in 2019.https://www.outdoorlife.com/can-cwd-really-be-cured#page-4 He specializes in the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), which include, but are not limited to, Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) \\"Mad cow disease\\" in cattle, scrapie in sheep and goats, and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) in humans.“MultiBriefs:” Professor claims cure for CWD, but others aren't sure” Bastian challenges the widely popular theory that the TSEs are caused by prions, which are composed mostly if not entirely of a misfolded form of a protein called PrP (i.e. PrPSc). He claims instead that the TSEs are caused by an extremely small, cell wall deficient bacterium called Spiroplasma, and that prions are the result of the disease process. The lack of a cell wall means it is not susceptible to most common antibiotics such as penicillin, which target cell wall synthesis. Bastian first found Spiroplasma in the brain of a CJD patient in an autopsy in 1979. He later demonstrated that Spiroplasma mirum strain SMCA (suckling mouse cataract agent) induces a microcystic spongiform encephalopathy in suckling rats that is similar to rat CJD. In 2007 he isolated Spiroplasma from scrapie and Chronic wasting disease (a TSE affecting deer, elk, and moose, abbreviated CWD), cultured them, and inoculated them into sheep and deer. According to Bastian, the scrapie and CWD Spiroplasma isolates caused a spongiform encephalopathy identical to scrapie and CWD. Under his hypothesis, because PrPSc is not the cause it is merely an imperfect marker of infection (with both sensitivity and NPV <1), and is either induced by Spiroplasma directly or by a defence mechanism of the host. In 2014 he discovered that Spiroplasma forms biofilms which give them significant resistance to radiation, heat, and disinfectants. He, along with Laura Manuelidis of Yale University, who claims that the TSEs are caused by an as yet undiscovered virus, are two of the main sceptics of the prion theory. Other scientists have so far been unable to duplicate his results, casting doubt on this hypothesis. Dr Bastian however maintains that the inability to detect Spiroplasma in 100% of cases stems from genetic variability of cases.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11940477_Spiroplasma_sp_16S_rDNA_in_Creutzfeldt- Jakob_Disease_and_Scrapie_as_Shown_by_pCR_and_DNA_Sequence_Analysis Publications See also *Laura Manuelidis *Stanley Prusiner *Prion *Slow virus *Virino *Spiroplasma References Category:Living people Category:American neurologists Category:American pathologists Category:Prions Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Frank O.

He played more than 100 roles in films, mostly secondary. Due to the psycho-physical conditions often was cast as a villain, in the roles of suspects, petty thugs, but is also known for his many comic roles.

In 1636 the Halincourt gate was built to the Rhone. The fort was completed in the 18th century, but construction of the current building began in 1834. Fort Saint-Jean has an area of 17,000 m2 and dominates the Saône river from 40m above the river. In 1932, the Military Health Service had its regional pharmacy there. On 2 September 1944, when Lyon was occupied by the Germans, a group of volunteers gathered at the fort to prevent the occupiers from destroying the bridges over the Saône. In 1984 the fort was occupied by the Veterinary Service of the Armed Forces.  Today  View of the fort from the quays of the Sâone Rehabilitated in 2001 by architect Pierre Vurpas, Fort St. Saint-Jean has been home, since 2004, to the National Treasury School (ENT) which became the National School of Public Finance (ENFiP) on 4 August 2010.

The registration process was conducted by Pedro Correa, Patricio Rosende and Waldo Carrasco. The new party adopted the slogan \\"To refound society\\" as a symbol and a yellow star on a blue background with the words \\"Liberal Party\\" at the bottom. In 1999 the Liberal Party, then headed by Adolfo Ballas, decided to support the presidential candidacy of Ricardo Lagos, to which a dissident faction that formed the Democratic Liberal Movement, which supported the candidacy of Joaquín Lavín, then dissolve and integrate formed the National Renewal party. The Liberal Party was re-registered as a political party legally constituted before the Electoral Service of Chile on March 17, 2000, after having taken steps to your re-enrollment in 1998. That same year was elected Armando Jaramillo Lyon as its president, and Party joined the electoral coalition Concertación for municipal elections.

It is part of the Photron FASTCAM line of cameras, introduced in 1996. Photron FASTCAM Ultima 40K was introduce in 2000. However, the camera was trade branded previously in 1992 as a KODAK MASD product. The Kodak HS4540 and the Photron Ultima 40K are the same camera, just different trade names. Overview and features The FASTCAM Ultima 40K native resolution is 256 x 256 pixels x 8 bits at 4,500 FPS. By reducing the resolution, the frame rate for recording can be increased. As an example, 40,500 FPS is achieved with a resolution of 64 x 64 pixels at 8 bits. The FASTCAM Ultima 40K processor came with three memory configurations that allowed full frame storage of 8192 images (512 MB), 16,384 images (1GB) or 24,576 images (1.5 GB). At 4,500 fps and maximum memory, the recording time is 5.46 seconds. The Ultima 40K image sensor reads images in blocks which is commonly called a Block Readout sensor. The image sensor is divided into 16 blocks where each block is 256 x 16 pixels. And within one block, one half to one fourth of the block can be partially read out. Digital image data could be read from the Processor through a SCSI interface. Live video images could be displayed on NTSC or PAL monitors. Ancillary information would be display as OSD (On-Screen-Data). The camera cable could be up to 15m from the Processor. The system could be controlled from a computer through an RS-232 interface sending simple ASCII commands. The FASTCAM Ultima 10K has been used in ballistic studies, airbag design and qualification studies, combustion studies, flow visualization studies such as aerosol dispersion and many other high-speed camera applications. Photron manufactured various version of this high-speed camera system ( Photron Rabbit, Kodak HS4540, Photron Ultima 40K and the Photron FASTCAM SE all using the same image sensor) from 1990 to 2006. Kodak MASD manufactured a similar high speed camera before the Photron Rabbit called the Kodak SP2000. This camera also used a Block Readout sensor with 240 x 192 pixels 8 bits at 12,000 fps. The SP2000 was first introduced in 1981, a full decade ahead in performance over any other high speed camera .

The film explores the production, impact, and legacy of the Back to the Future film series, and includes interviews with members of the series' cast and crew, including Robert Zemeckis, Steven Spielberg, Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, as well as fans of the franchise.  Synopsis  The film includes footage of various cast and crew members of the Back to the Future film series, discussing the trilogy and its cultural impact. Among these interviewees are actors Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Donald Fullilove, and Claudia Wells; filmmakers Robert Zemeckis, Bob Gale, and Steven Spielberg; musicians Huey Lewis and Alan Silvestri; fans of the films such as Dan Harmon, co-creator of the Back to the Future-inspired animated series Rick and Morty; and former head of Columbia Pictures, Frank Price. While delving into the legacy of the films themselves, the documentary also studies the cultural importance of the DeLorean, used as a time machine in the series, the technology involved in creating a real-life hoverboard, and the cast and crew's experiences during the pre-production, production, and post- production of the original film.  Production  Back in Time began as a project conceived by Jason Aron, a fan of the Back to the Future series, that was posted to the crowdfunding website Kickstarter on June 26, 2013. Over 600 people backed the campaign, pledging over $45,000 in order for the documentary to be made. The film was shot over a period of two years; while production primarily took place in the United States, another filming location was that of London, England during a Back to the Future fan event. The film was released online on October 21, 2015, the day that the series' protagonist Marty McFly travels to in Back to the Future Part II. Shortly after its release, the documentary was added to the Netflix streaming service. Critical reception Gregory Weinkauf of The Huffington Post said that the documentary \\"gets to the heart of the Back to the Future phenomenon, proving as enjoyable as the franchise it affectionately explores\\", calling it \\"a delightful return to, and updating of, a beloved story\\". Reviewer Logan J. Fowler of the website Pop-Break noted that while the film's segment on the science of hover technology didn't \\"seem to gel in with the rest of the documentary\\", it was \\"a well crafted and awesome look back at the movie that changed so many lives in the past, and will continue to do so in the future\\".

A minority stake in the venture is owned by NextEra Energy and Duke Energy. The pipeline has been being planned since before 2011. In July 2013 it was announced that Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) jointly awarded its parent corporation, NextEra Energy and Spectra Energy the bid to build the pipeline. In May 2015, Duke Energy bought an interest in the venture. Construction began in September 2016. The pipeline is currently scheduled to be in service by June 2017. Environmental concerns and federal agency permission The construction of the pipeline has drawn concern from the communities through which it is planned to be built. Protests in Albany, Georgia and Valdosta, Georgia have occurred in response to the plans to build the pipelines. The threat of eminent domain and the environmental impact are among the concerns that have been voiced by citizens. In late October 2015, the United States Environmental Protection Agency recommended to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that the pipeline be rerouted away from the Floridan aquifer because of the karst geology that is prone to sinkholes and also contains wetlands. Environmental concerns have also been raised regarding threats to endangered species habitat along the route including crocodile, manatee and sea turtle breeding and nesting grounds.Sinkhole raises collapse concerns at pipeline drilling site, WTLV, Anne Schindler, December 5, 2016. Retrieved 18 June 2017. Others including Sanford Bishop, Hank Johnson, David Scott and John Lewis have voiced concern over the construction of a proposed compressor station near an already disadvantaged African American community in Albany, Georgia. Despite the recommendations of Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the pipeline's route in February 2016. In August 2016, the Army Corps of Engineers approved the route through North Florida. Some citizens from the areas of the route continued to voice concerns about the environmental impact the pipeline would have the environment after it was approved by the various governmental agencies. The federal permits require the companies constructing the pipeline to engage in mitigation banking. On February 26, 2017 an apparent protester was seen firing a high powered rifle at the pipeline construction site. The man fled and was chased by police until he crashed and was killed by a deputy after he tried to engage police in a gunfight [] Construction In September 2016, construction began on the pipeline. On November 12, 2016, fourteen protesters were arrested at a pipeline construction site in Gilchrist County, Florida after one protester locked himself to truck on site and the others obstructed its path. They had been inspired by the Dakota Access Pipeline protests and used similar protest signage. In late October 2016, drilling mud seepage began leaking into the Withlacoochee River at construction along the border of Brooks County, Georgia and Lowndes County, Georgia from a pilot hole that had been drilled underneath the river in preparation for the horizontal directional drilling hole. After the leakage was discovered, the Sabal Company installed containment booms at the site and posted a vacuum truck to capture the mud seepage. The spill prompted protests from concerned local citizens on November 16, 2016. As part of the company's biweekly report for the week ending on November 27 to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, it was reported that a sinkhole had developed southeast of the horizontal directional drilling (HDD) hole exit point at the work site near the Withlacoochee River. The sinkhole had been identified on November 5 by workers in the field.

He is a Republican member of the eleven-person (eight elected, three appointed) Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, which sets and monitors education policy. Since 2008, he has represented District 1, which encompasses populous Jefferson, Orleans, and St. Tammany parishes. Background Garvey is descended from a prominent Roman Catholic family in his native New Orleans, a grandson of Thomas Joseph Garvey and the former Loretta Kuntz. His father, James Garvey, Sr., and his uncle, Lawrence \\"Larry\\" Garvey, established the former Radiofone paging company, based in Metairie, into a regional wireless telecommunications operation. The Garvey brothers launched the company in 1958 with the conversion of their parents' physician-calling business. In 1984, they demonstrated their cellular telephone service at the New Orleans World's Fair. From 1992 to 2000, early in his legal career, Garvey Jr., was counsel for Radiofone. In 2000, however, the Garvey brothers sold Radiofone for $400 million to SBC Communications. It was then sold again to the former Alltel company, based in Little Rock, Arkansas. Lawrence Garvey was heavily involved in the right to life movement in New Orleans. Another Garvey uncle, Richard Joseph Garvey, Sr. (1926-2015), born in Pierce City, Missouri, moved to New Orleans at the age of three. He was a Loyola graduate and from 1966 to 1996 the Division C judge of the Orleans Parish Civil District Court. In 1982, James Garvey, Jr., graduated from the Catholic-affiliated Jesuit High School in New Orleans. In 1987, he received a Bachelor of Business Administration from Loyola University New Orleans. In 1991, Garvey obtained a Master of Business Administration from Loyola and a Juris Doctorate that same year from Loyola University New Orleans College of Law. Admitted to the bar in 1992, Garvey has been affiliated since 2006 with the Metairie office of the firm, Hailey McNamara, with specialization in product liability, commercial transportation, personal property litigation, and insurance law. He handled numerous cases stemming from Hurricane Katrina. One of his law partners is his cousin, Richard J. Garvey, Jr. Garvey is a board member for the New Orleans chapter of Teach For America, a nonprofit organization which recruits college graduates to teach for at least two years in lower-income American communities. He also sits on the boards of the Jefferson Parish Education Foundation and the Jefferson Parish Economic Development Commission. He has been active with the Metropolitan Battered Women's Program and served as well on the Governor's Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Advisory Board. Garvey is a member of Phi Delta Phi, the international legal honor society. Garvey and his wife, Katharine Clarie Garvey, have four children. Political activities Garvey won the BESE seat, an unpaid position but with reimbursement for expenses, without opposition in the nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 20, 2007. The position opened when Republican Penny Dastugue, the wife of former State Representative Quentin D. Dastugue, did not seek reelection. In the 2011 primary, Garvey won a second term by defeating two opponents, fellow Republican Sharon Hewitt of Slidell in St. Tammany Parish, and the No-Party candidate Lee Price Barrios, a Baton Rouge native, a former manuscript assistant to the author Walker Percy, and a retired teacher who resides in Abita Springs, also in St. Tammany Parish. Garvey polled 57,910 votes (58.4 percent); Hewitt, 29,483 (29.7 percent); Barrios, 11,856 (12 percent). On October 15, 2015, The Baton Rouge Advocate reported that PAC-Empower Louisiana had allocated about $818,000 to the BESE races. The PAC members included Alice and Jim Walton, Wal-Mart heirs who reside in Bentonville, Arkansas, and Eli Broad of Los Angeles, California. Four candidates in eight districts, including Garvey, were declared \\"acceptable\\" to Empower Louisiana; Garvey received $230,459 from the group, the most of any in the state. Another report placed his independent expenditure PAC contributions at $217,493 from independent expenditure PACS. A supporter of teachers' unions, Barrios opposes what she calls excessive reliance on standardized testing, the Common Core State Standards initiative, charter schools, and state Education Superintendent John C. White, backed by outgoing Governor Bobby Jindal who was formerly affiliated with Teach for America. Garvey supports standardized tests, Common Core, charter schools, and Superintendent White. Garvey favors the use of pupil standardized test results as the major criteria for the annual evaluation of teachers. He stresses parental choice and the establishment of an early childhood education system. In February 2015, Garvey called for an early review of the Common Core standards to seek consensus: \\"That is something that I have been pushing behind the scenes.\\" BESE requires a review every seven years; the compromise plan moved up the review by one year. \\"We still have the authority on what is in our standards. We have not given up any control to the feds [U.S. government] despite what some people have been claiming to the contrary,\\" Garvey added. Barrios disagreed with Garvey on key policy issues. Garvey predicted that voters will benefit from the contrasting views of the candidates: \\"If I have to run against someone, I would like it to be a clear choice for the public.\\" As the sitting board vice president, Garvey won his third term on the board against Lee Barrios, who ran in 2015 as a Republican. Garvey outspent Barrios $218,460 to $2,886. The Louisiana Association of Business and Industry contributed $40,000 to Garvey; departing BESE president Chas Roemer gave him $2,500. The bulk of Garvey's funding was left over from the 2011 race; he raised $21,200 in nine contributions between July to September 2015. Common Core supporters won most of the races statewide though one opponent, interim member Mary Johnson Harris of Shreveport, backed by the group \\"Flip BESE\\", led her District 4 race and is headed to a runoff election on November 21. Garvey polled 84,447 votes (71 percent) to Barrios' 34,487 (29 percent). In the same 2015 primary in which Garvey defeated Barrios, his other former opponent from 2011, Sharon Hewitt, was elected to the District 1 seat in the Louisiana State Senate vacated by the retiring A. G. Crowe. Hewitt handily defeated her intra-party rival, former State Representative Pete Schneider of Lacombe. Garvey is a campaign contributor to his fellow New Orleans area Republicans David Vitter, the U.S. senator who is running for governor in 2015, and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana's 1st congressional district.

By reducing the resolution, the frame rate for recording can be increased. As an example, 40,500 FPS is achieved with a resolution of 64 x 64 pixels at 8 bits. The FASTCAM SE processor came with three memory configurations that allowed full frame storage of 8192 images (512 MB), 16,384 images (1GB) or 24,576 images (1.5 GB). At 4,500 fps and maximum memory, the recording time is 5.46 seconds. The SE image sensor reads images in blocks which is commonly called a Block Readout sensor. The image sensor is divided into 16 blocks where each block is 256 x 16 pixels. And within one block, one half to one fourth of the block can be partially read out. Digital image data could be read from the Processor through a SCSI interface. Live video images could be displayed on NTSC or PAL monitors. Ancillary information would be display as OSD (On-Screen-Data). The camera cable could be up to 15m from the Processor. The system could be controlled from a computer through an RS-232 interface sending simple ASCII commands. The FASTCAM SE has been used in ballistic studies, airbag design and qualification studies, combustion studies, flow visualization studies such as aerosol dispersion and many other high-speed camera applications. Photron manufactured various version of this high-speed camera system ( Photron Rabbit, Kodak HS4540, Photron SE and the Photron FASTCAM Ultima 40K all using the same image sensor) from 1990 to 2006. Kodak MASD manufactured a similar high speed camera before the Photron Rabbit called the Kodak SP2000. This camera also used a Block Readout sensor with 240 x 192 pixels 8 bits at 12,000 fps. The SP2000 was first introduced in 1981, a full decade ahead in performance over any other high speed camera .

It is the highest residential building in the Czech Republic with 104 metres in height and 30 floors. Construction started in 2016 and ended in 2018. It was designed by Czech architect Radan Hubička and the investor was Aceur Investment.  Location  City Tower, City Empiria (in the background) and V Tower, 2016 The building is located in an area above the Vltava river with views of the city centre, as well as the Prague Castle and the residential neighbourhoods Vysehrad and Vinohrady. The apartment complex is also to be situated close to a number of leisure facilities or schools. The site is approximately the same distance from the downtown shops on Parizska Street, and the State Opera, as it is to the Hodkovicky Golf Resort and the Velka Chuchle horse racing facility. Pankrác Plain is the only suitable location within the center of Prague which is suitable for the construction of high-rise flats. This was verified using a number of widely accepted architectural tests which date back many years. The tower is to be situated on Pankrác Plain and will be near three other pre-existing buildings. These high-rises are each of 109, 104, and 79 meters in height. Because of the high number of high-rises in the area, the plain has been dubbed the “Prague Manhattan” as the skyline is becoming reminiscent of one which would be seen in New York. In addition to the other buildings which are also situated on the plain, V Tower will be close to a residential building, which is also yet to be built, but is planned to have a height of 108 metres.  Description  An example of modern Czech architecture, the building is divided into a pair of towers which are to be linked at two-thirds of their height, above which they continue upwards separately. This is allowing for the tower to expand in size as it rises whilst minimising its ground appropriation, leaving space for terraces around the outside of the building. The larger area towards the top of the towers is where the residential apartments are, resulting in the highest apartments having more space than those which are slightly closer to the bottom of the towers. Development =Design= The \\"V\\" (Victoria) is the general symbol of openness, freedom, joy and optimism. The idea behind the shape of V Tower is also to represent the yin and yang – the masculine and the feminine. The building itself is constructed of glass walls which are designed so that they will reflect light from every angle, as opposed from being transparent. Glass partitions and sliding doors will be used inside the apartments to create the openness of which the \\"V\\" is symbolic. V Tower was designed by the award- winning architectural studio, Radan Hubička. The architectural studio has been successful in producing renowned designs for residential buildings and luxury apartments and, in 2005, the company won a competition to design the City Epoque Complex in Prague. This is now the location of V Tower, in addition to a four star Sheraton Hotel. The apartments in V Tower boast technology never seen before in the Czech Republic, including technology for tranquil cooling, heating and ventilation to ensure the right temperature for residents which has only been seen before at the 2010 Olympics sites in Vancouver, Canada, and in a small number of residences in Cote d'Azur, France. The developers also focused on the smart use of electric energy. Working on the acoustics of the apartments are British experts who specialise in soundproofing. This will be done to prevent excessive noise caused by high winds – particularly in the higher apartments. =ECM Real Estate Investments Bankruptcy= The original developer of V Tower was ECM Real Estate Investments but, upon the company's bankruptcy in 2013, Aceur Investments took over the project. This resulted in the redesigning of the building, with the new developers working in conjunction with architect Radan Hubička to create the new designs. The plans changed so drastically that new planning and construction permits had to be acquired before construction could begin and the progress of development was pushed back by two years, with new completion date expected to be in the third quarter of 2017. When the project was being developed by ECM Real Estate Investments, it was called \\"Epoque\\". =Cost= It is estimated that the cost of construction of V Tower will come to 3 Billion CZK, which is approximately $123,706,230.00 USD. Objections V Tower during construction in summer 2016 In the initial stages of planning V Tower (even before ECM Real Estate Investments went bankrupt) there were concerns over whether or not the building would be approved. Prague locals objected to the further construction of high-rises and started a campaign in an attempt to prevent the towers from being built. This campaign was picked up by experts from UNESCO World Heritage Committee, who were also worried that the \\"skyscrapers\\" would destroy Prague’s historical and unique skyline. UNESCO objected to the heights of the buildings which were proposed to be erected in such close proximity to Prague’s historical centre. They required one of the proposed buildings be reduced to a maximum height of 70 metres as they feared any higher could be detrimental to Prague’s tourist industry. The result of this decision was that the Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic reviewed their decision to construct the buildings. The plans for the buildings had to be revised due to this in order to try and resolve the issue. When development was taken over by Aceur Investments, there were no new concerns raised over the new construction plans, and V Tower has been allowed to go ahead as planned. Apartments There are 120 flats in total, ranging from smaller studios, to large apartments, and four story penthouses with private gardens and recreational swimming pools on the roof of the complex. Additionally, there is a gym, a spa and sauna, and a swimming pool available to all residents between the ground floor and the third level, as well as facilities to care for the residents' pets, dry cleaning facilities, and catering services. The ground floor of the complex will consist only of a reception desk and vertical cores. There is also to be a concierge in the lobby at all times and each apartment owner will have access to the tower’s garages, where they can safely park their vehicles whilst on the premises. These garages are located underneath the complex, with 254 spaces across 3 floors. Additionally, there is a dedicated team of handymen working at the complex who cater to the needs of the residents. The individual apartments are all designed to be primarily sunlit and will open into the park area which surrounds the building. There are one to five bedrooms in each apartment and residents will have access to a children's room in the building. The sales of the V Tower’s apartments launched in September, 2015. The apartments have been put on the market at a starting price of 100,000 Crowns (approximately $3200 USD) per square meter. However, the higher up the apartment is in the complex, the higher the price becomes and Aceur Investments have been unwilling to disclose the cost of the most expensive apartments and luxury penthouses. The flats vary in their size with the smallest ones being 50 square meters and the largest being 380 square meters. Awards The V Tower won two awards before its completion. The building received both Best Residential High-rise Architecture Czech Republic and Best Residential High-rise Development Czech Republic awards in the European category at the International Property Awards in 2015. It also aspires to acquire Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum certification, requiring the building to adhere to what are considered to be the most stringent set of requirements before it can receive the green building certification. It is the only building in the Czech Republic and the whole of Europe to have achieve such ranking. Additionally, V Tower will also compete in the International Property Awards on behalf of Europe. It will compete in the world finals in the architectural high-rise building division, where it will come up against the winners from this category from all around the world. The tower will be challenged by the UK, America, Africa, Arab countries, and the Asia-Pacific region. A committee made up of 80 experts in the fields of real estate, architects, and designers will decide the winner based on the award criteria, which consists of: safety, sustainability, and architecture. The finals of the International Property Awards, where the winner will be decided, takes place in early December in London in 2015.

It is exceptional for its unusual morphology and for the unusual features in its genome, often considered to represent large differences in internal organization compared with most prokaryotes. G. obscuriglobus has been described as \\"the platypus of microbiology\\". Discovery G. obscuriglobus is a freshwater bacterium, originally described on the basis of a single strain isolated from the littoral region near the Maroon Dam in Queensland, Australia. Morphology and internal structure G. obscuriglobus is a large, roughly spherical bacterium with a cell diameter of 1–2μm. It is motile and possesses multiple flagella per cell (that is, it is multitrichous). Dense, compact DNA and a deeply invaginated membrane are characteristics of the species. =Membrane structure= Among the most notable features of G. obscuriglobus is its highly complex and morphologically distinctive cell membrane system, including deep invaginations of its membrane that historically have been described as closed internal membranes that may surround the bacterium's DNA by analogy to a eukaryotic cell nucleus. The concept of membrane-bound genetic material has been described as a \\"cell plan\\" unique to a proposed superphylum composed of the Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Chlamydiae (PVC) and distinct from the rest of the Gram-negative bacteria. The question of whether G. obscuriglobus and other members of the PVC group possess closed internal membranes and therefore have a unique \\"cell plan\\" is considered important in understanding the evolution of membrane-bound compartments, which are often considered a distinguishing feature between eukaryotes and prokaryotes; the lineage that gave rise to the PVC superphylum is speculated to be related to an \\"intermediate\\" state between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The question of how the PVC superfamily membranes are organized and how they relate to eukaryotes is an active and controversial area of research. Three-dimensional tomogram reconstructions of whole cells reported in 2013 suggest that contrary to historical belief, G. obscuriglobus membranes are continuous and do not enclose distinct cellular compartments. However, this study has been criticized for not detecting or modeling some commonly reported structural features, and a 2014 study using similar methodology was interpreted as supporting the earlier hypothesis of closed internal compartments. =Membrane and cell wall composition= Early characterization of G. obscuriglobus found that it lacked a traditional Gram-negative peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall and instead possessed a proteinaceous exterior layer, later described as possibly analogous to an archaeal S-layer. More recent reports have found the exterior to more closely chemically resemble typical Gram-negative features. Compositional analysis of the membrane has been reported to find lipopolysaccharide in G. obscuriglobus, consistent with typical features of Gram-negative outer membranes. A 2015 study of several planctomycetes including G. obscuriglobus identified the presence of a PG cell wall following the typical Gram-negative structure by both biochemical and bioinformatic analysis. =Nucleoids= One or more nucleoid-like regions of densely compact DNA is commonly observed in G. obscuriglobus cells. Complex internal structure resembling a liquid crystal has been reported, with some structural similarities to the chromatin of eukaryotes such as dinoflagellates. The structure of the nucleoid has been implicated in the unusual radiation tolerance of G. obscuriglobus. Transcription and translation of genes have been reported to occur in spatially segregated locations within the cell, which is otherwise characteristic of eukaryotic but not prokaryotic cells. Sterol synthesis G. obscuriglobus is one of the few prokaryotes known to synthesize sterols, a process critical to the maintenance of eukaryotic cell membranes and ubiquitous in eukaryotes. The sterols identified in the bacterium, lanosterol and parkeol, are relatively simple compared to eukaryotic sterols; as indicated by phylogenetic analysis, the G. obscuriglobus sterol biosynthetic pathway was among the most primitive known at the time it was identified. Endocytosis G. obscuriglobus was the first bacterium shown to possess a mechanism for protein import into the cell, analogous to eukaryotic endocytosis. Active, ATP-dependent, likely receptor- mediated import of extracellular proteins has been observed under laboratory conditions, although it is of unknown functional significance. This may suggest that planctomycete and eukaryote endocytosis mechanism share a common evolutionary origin, that the two processes may be an example of convergent evolution, or that G. obscuriglobus acquired its endocytotic infrastructure through horizontal gene transfer; of the three possibilities, the latter is considered unlikely due to statistical features of the bacterial genes associated with the process. There is disagreement over the possibility that proteins with homology to clathrins are represented in the G. obscuriglobus proteome. The bacterium's ability to synthesize sterols may also be involved in its capacity for membrane invaginations and endocytosis because sterols are known to facilitate membrane deformation. Genomic content and organization The G. obscuriglobus genome was sequenced by the J. Craig Venter Institute. The bacterium has a large genome by the standards of other PVC bacteria, around 9 megabases, and contains about 8,000 genes. It has 67% GC content. It possesses unusual genetic infrastructure, lacking a key component of most bacterial cell division processes, the protein FtsZ. A study of indels in protein-coding genes of the PVC grouping identified a number of biochemical pathways with unusually high numbers of indels in the G. obscuriglobus genome, including ribosomal proteins. Reproduction Electron micrograph of G. obscuriglobus in the process of dividing by budding. Labels indicate the nucleoid (N) of the mother (larger) and daughter (smaller) cells, and the nucleoid envelope (NE) of the daughter cell, which is described as not yet fully formed. Scale bar = 1μm. Like most planctomycetes, G. obscuriglobus reproduces by budding rather than the fission more commonly observed in bacterial species. It is relatively slow-growing, with an estimated generation time of around 13 hours based on bulk cell culture. Its life cycle consists of a motile or \\"swarmer\\" phase and a sessile phase during which budding occurs, although these are less distinct than in other planctomycetes whose life cycles have been studied. Observations of individual cells in culture found that approximately 12 hours were required for bud maturation and separation, followed by an asymmetrical lag phase in which mother cells were quicker to begin a new budding cycle than were newly budded daughter cells. It has been reported that the budding process involves transfer of naked DNA to the daughter cell, after which it is then surrounded by a nucleoid membrane. However, three-dimensional reconstructions indicate that DNA is never surrounded by a closed membrane in a newly created bud, but instead is free to diffuse from the mother to daughter cell cytoplasm after the \\"neck\\" between the mother and daughter cell membranes, initially as narrow as 30 nanometers, widens sufficiently to accommodate condensed DNA.

BESE sets policies for some 700,000 public school pupils statewide. Background Harris is one of five children, four surviving, born in Shreveport to the late Julius Johnson and Eleanor Frazier Johnson (1933-2014), who was an active Roman Catholic and a secretary for St. Johns Berchelmans Grade School and the B'Nai Zion Jewish congregation in Shreveport. Mary Johnson Harris received her bachelor's degree in liberal arts, with teacher certification, from Louisiana State University in Shreveport, date unavailable. In 2005, she obtained a master's degree in counseling from Louisiana Tech University in Ruston. In 2007, she obtained an educational specialist degree from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. Thereafter, she pursued another forty-five graduate hours from Louisiana Tech. Her training includes elementary education leadership and childhood literacy. Harris is married to Keith David Harris. They have a son, Robert Keith \\"Robbie\\" Harris (born September 1984). She also has two stepdaughters and three grandchildren. A Christian, she has been involved in various mission trips and as a result has taught in such countries as Mexico, Honduras, the Dominican Republic, and Jamaica. Harris began her career when her son was in kindergarten and she was in school two to three nights per week while also working. \\"I don't think I could have done this if I had not had a wonderful support system in my husband and parent,\\" she said. Since 2011, Harris has been the principal of South Highlands Elementary Academic and Performing Arts Magnet School in Shreveport. Her magnet school has twice been designated a \\"Blue Ribbon School of Excellence.\\" From 2009 to 2011, Harris she was the instructional coordinator at the Oak Park MicroSociety Elementary School in Shreveport. Earlier, from 2007 to 2009, she was master teacher at South Highlands Elementary School. From 2003 to 2007, she was a reading specialist at Summer Grove Elementary School. Prior to 2002, she was affiliated with St. Joseph Elementary School in Shreveport. Her Facebook campaign website in 2015 indicates that she had twenty-seven years of experience in professional education. Harris is a former \\"Teacher of the Year\\" for both Caddo Parish and the northwestern region of her state. Both former Governor Kathleen Blanco, a Democrat, and outgoing State Senator Sherri Smith Buffington, a Republican, recognized her for her achievements in education. She once testified before a congressional committee on National Board Certification for teachers. She is a past winner of the National Milken Family Foundation Teacher Award. BESE role In January 2015, then Governor Bobby Jindal appointed Harris to succeed Walter C. Lee, another Shreveport Republican educator. A former superintendent of both Caddo and DeSoto parishes, Lee resigned his seat under an ethics cloud in December 2014. He had been the longest serving member ever of BESE. A special election to fill Lee's seat was initially planned for March 28 but was cancelled by the governor. Therefore, Harris did not face voters for the balance of the unexpired term until the regular nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 24, 2015. In the primary, Harris led two other Republican candidates, James Tony Davis (born September 1981), a businessman from his native of Natchitoches, and Glynis Rae Johnston (born April 1957), an educator at A.C. Steere Elementary School in Shreveport and like Harris an opponent of the Common Core State Standards program. In the campaign, Johnston described herself as \\"the people's voice. I will not be controlled. I will not be a puppet. Jindal's puppet or anyone's puppet.\\" No Democrat contested the position. Harris received 47,834 votes (43.2 percent) and faced a general election, often called a runoff in Louisiana, with Tony Davis, who polled 40,895 votes (36.9 percent). Johnston held the remaining but critical 22,107 votes (20 percent). In the second round of balloting, Davis unseated Harris, 63,610 votes (51.2 percent) to her 60,746 (48.9 percent). Her campaign website describes Harris as a lifelong Republican, a conservative, and an opponent of Common Core. Johnson proposed that Common Core be replaced with an initiative that is \\"more beneficial to our students.\\" Harris opposes taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood and other groups performing abortions. She objects to incest or rape exceptions as grounds for a legal abortion and opposes sex education which emphasizes contraception and abortion. She opposes sexual orientation as a protected class. She opposes penalties being imposed upon individuals, businesses, or public employees who decline to perform services in violation of their moral objections. She objects to the expansion of gambling. She opposes illegal immigration and signed a \\"No New Taxes\\" pledge. She favors repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Regarding state educational issues, Harris said: > We need more educators making decisions about education. There will be many > important issues facing BESE in the next few months, including replacing > Common Core, funding and proposed revisions to the current evaluation system > of our teachers. This is an important time for our state and I have the > educational knowledge, experience (local, state and national) and proven > leadership ability to navigate the myriad of issues that a board member > faces. Her opponent, Tony Davis, a graduate of Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, has been since 2010 the president and chief executive officer of the Natchitoches Area Chamber of Commerce. Since 2014, he has been president of the Natchitoches Community Alliance Foundation, Inc., since 2014. He is a board member too of the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry. Davis supports setting standards in schools, which Harris said means that he supports Common Core. Davis had he is \\"not an educator and I don't think that is a prerequisite for the job by any means. My experiences involve ... the chamber and any type of development work that I do.\\" Harris carried the backing of State Representative Mike Johnson of Bossier Parish and BESE appointed member Jane H. Smith, one of Johnson's predecessors in the House. She was backed by all twelve members of the Bossier Parish School Board, three Caddo Parish School Board members, one, Ralph Wilson, of the Natchitoches Parish School Board, and another, Ronnie Broughton of the Webster Parish School Board, who is the state chairman of the Constitution Party. Harris is the official choice of the Louisiana Republican Party and the Tea party movement. After the primary, the whole DeSoto Parish School Board also endorsed Harris. A political action committee, Continuing America's Strength and Security, which supports Harris in the amount of $2,500, is tied to Republican U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, who opposes Common Core and instead supports local control over education. Tony Davis, conversely, has drawn $35,000 from other such groups supportive of Common Core.

Its strategy focused on the male readers' market, competing with other publishers such as Beacon Books. The covers of many Midwood Books featured works by prolific illustrators of the era, including Paul Rader. Novels from Midwood Books were written by many well-known authors, most writing under pseudonyms. Among these were Lawrence Block, Donald E. Westlake, Robert Silverberg, and Richard E. Geis.  History  Harry Shorten was a writer and editor who had worked for MLJ Comics, publisher of Archie, for most of the 1940s and 1950s. He had made his fortune by creating, with comics artist Al Fagaly, a syndicated gag cartoon called There Oughta Be a Law!. Looking for an investment in the financial results of his comics, Shorten decided to become an editor of paperbacks. He wanted to follow the example of publishers Beacon Books and Universal Distributing, which specialized in publishing cheap, lightweight books telling dramatic or erotic romances, with suggestive covers, for a male audience. Thus he created in 1957 the publishing house Midwood Books, named after his neighborhood in Brooklyn. At the time, the publishing house address was 505 Eighth Avenue in Manhattan. Unlike other New York publishers such as Bennett Cerf at Random House, Shorten did not have extensive knowledge of quality literature. But he knew what would entice the average American reader. His books were bright, colorful, and eye-catching. Midwood's first publications were paperback collections of the There Oughta Be a Law! strips and an unnumbered book series in the same style as Beacon Books. With the 1958 release of Midwood 007 — Love Nest, by Robert Silverberg, writing as \\"Loren Beauchamp\\" — began the emergence of authors and artists recognized later as appurtenant to Midwood. Shorten quickly began soliciting manuscripts from the Scott Meredith Literary Agency (which also provided manuscripts for fellow pulp publisher Nightstand Books). Only five people wrote most of the first 40 issues of the Midwood numbered series: Lawrence Block (\\"Sheldon Lord\\"), Robert Silverberg (\\"Loren Beauchamp\\"), Donald E. Westlake (\\"Alan Marshall\\"\\"), Orrie Hitt, and Hal Dresner (\\"Don Holliday\\"). This group stabilized Midwood until Shorten was able to put together a stable of recurring writers, such as Sally Singer, Gilbert Fox, Julie Ellis, John Plunkett, and Elaine Williams. Although nobody at Midwood knew it at the time, several writers were providing books for both Midwood and Nightstand, but under different pen names. For example, \\"Loren Beauchamp\\" (Robert Silverberg) become \\"Don Elliott\\" a year later at Nightstand, \\"Sheldon Lord\\" (Lawrence Block) became \\"Andrew Shaw.\\" Some writers wrote under the same name for both publishers. Shorten obtained his cover illustrations from the Art Balcourt Service, the same agency that provided covers for Beacon. Artists such as Nappi, Rader, and Robert Maguire were significant to the company's success. The covers sold the books: Midwood's novels were not great literature, but were generally very entertaining. Many pages contained sex scenes, described as pornographic, full of insinuations and veiled references. Although romances and melodramas were of more interest to women, the target audience of companies like Midwood and Beacon was men. This was apparent from their covers. In 1964, Midwood merged with Tower Publications to form two subsidiaries: Midwood-Tower and Tower Comics. Shorten went on to be editor-in- chief of Tower Comics.Irving, Chris. \\"Rise and Fall of Tower Comics,\\" Comic Book Artist #14 (July 2001). By 1965, Midwood's headquarters were at 185 Madison Avenue (alongside fellow pulp publisher Lancer Books).Montgomery, Paul L. \\"Pulp Sex Novels Thrive as Trade Comes Into Open,\\" New York Times (September 5, 1965).  Popularity among lesbians  Pulp titles with strong connotations of lesbians were very popular; the authors were frequently men using female pen names, such as \\"Barbara Brooks,\\" \\"Jill Emerson,\\" and \\"Kimberly Kemp;\\" while the target audience was male readers, an unexpected second small audience base was lesbians themselves, with these books often reviewed in early lesbian and gay publications such as One Magazine and The Ladder by Barbara Grier, under her pseudonym \\"Gene Damon.\\" Julie Ellis, though not lesbian herself (unlike Singer and Williams), bucked her bosses by insisting on putting happy endings for the lesbian lovers in her lesbian pulp fiction, a brave act for which she received much appreciative fan mail from emerging lesbian social and activist groups during Ellis's Midwood-Tower authorship period (1962-1968).

It is known from several media that he conducted art innovation based on traditional Chinese painting and calligraphy skills, focusing on line and stroke manipulation. Simultaneously he brought in Western painting techniques such as visual contrast and special perspectives of painting, and integrated these Chinese and Western art elements. Also, he developed a macro-to-micro observation approach by boldly mimicking digital camera dynamic zoom functionality to find various perspectives that maximize the detailed beauty of objects in the work. The objects were expressed by the variety and contrast of lines, brushing strokes and ink. Several media, including \\"Calligraphy Reported·Field of Calligraphy and Painting\\", \\"People's Daily Online\\" and \\"Chinese Painting & Calligraphy\\"(中国书画), considered that all of these produced the novel Chinese art style called \\"Heaven Style\\", which was an innovation that brought new vigor and vitality to Chinese art field, and shaped a new trend of art.Chinese Painting & Calligraphy(中国书画), 2014 Issue 9 http://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFDTotal-SHUH201409020.htm Some of these \\"Heaven Style\\" representative works include Florida Impression(佛州印象), Fun in the Lotus Pond Looking from Heaven(从天堂看到的荷塘乐趣), and Blossom of Hydrangea(绣球花开).https://www.lightspacetime.com/artist-news/shaoqiang-chens- art-works-in-hangzhou-china/ Light Space & Time Gallery Artist News-Shaoqiang Chen’s Art Works in Hangzhou, China According to Calligraphy Reported·Field of Calligraphy and Painting and other international media, post Shaqiang Chen's creation in \\"Heaven Style\\" painting, there has been known influence in Chinese painting field.

It is one of the 19 Upanishads attached to the Atharvaveda, and is classified as one of the eight Shakta Upanishads. It is, as an Upanishad, a part of the corpus of Vedanta literature collection that present the philosophical concepts of Hinduism. The text was likely composed between 9th- to 14th-centuries CE. It refers to Mahadevi as representing all goddesses. The Devi Upanishad is part of the five Atharvashiras Upanishads important to Tantra and Shakta philosophy traditions. The Upanishad states that the Goddess is the Brahman (ultimate metaphysical Reality), and from her arise Prakṛti (matter) and Purusha (consciousness). She is bliss and non-bliss, the Vedas and what is different from it, the born and the unborn, and all of the universe. Etymology Devi and Deva are Sanskrit terms found in the Vedic literature, such as the Rigveda of the 2nd millennium BCE.Klaus Klostermaier (1984), Mythologies and Philosophies of Salvation in the Theistic Traditions of India, Wilfrid Laurier University Press, , pages 198-202 Deva is masculine, and the related feminine equivalent is Devi. They mean \\"heavenly, divine, terrestrial things of high excellence, exalted, shining ones\\".John Stratton Hawley and Donna Marie Wulff (1998), Devi: Goddesses of India, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 18-21 Etymologically, the cognates of Devi are Latin dea and Greek thea.John Stratton Hawley and Donna Marie Wulff (1998), Devi: Goddesses of India, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 2 The term Upanishad means it is knowledge or \\"hidden doctrine\\" text that belongs to the corpus of Vedanta literature collection presenting the philosophical concepts of Hinduism and considered the highest purpose of its scripture, the Vedas.Max Muller, The Upanishads, Part 1, Oxford University Press, page LXXXVI footnote 1, 22, verse 13.4 History According to Cheever Mackenzie Brown – a professor of Religion at the Trinity University,C Mackenzie Brown Trinity University, Department of Religion, Texas (2015) this important Tantric and Shaktism text was probably composed sometime between the ninth and fourteenth centuries CE. The Devi Upanishad is part of the five Atharva Shiras Upanishads, each of which are named after the five main deities or shrines (panchayatanan) of Ganapati, Narayana, Rudra, Surya and Devi. Its philosophy is also found in the Tripura Upanishad, Bahvricha Upanishad, and the Guhyakala Upanishad. Composed in Sanskrit, it is a minor Upanishad. The text is listed at 81 in the modern era anthology of 108 Upanishads found in the Muktika enumerated by Rama to Hanuman. Some manuscripts of this Upanishad are titled as the Devyupanishad (देव्युपनिषत्).Vedic Literature, Volume 1, , Government of Tamil Nadu, Madras, India, pages 424-425 Foundation and structure The Devi Upanishad comprises 32 verses after an invocation from the Atharvaveda. The text describes the goddess as the highest principle, and the ultimate truth in the universe (Brahman).James Lochtefeld (2002), Brahman, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing, , page 122PT Raju (2006), Idealistic Thought of India, Routledge, , page 426 and Conclusion chapter part XII The foundational premises of reverence for the feminine, as stated in the Devi Upanishad, are present in the Rigveda, in the following hymn, The Devi Upanishad, in a manner similar to this Rigvedic hymn, asserts that from the Goddess arise Prakṛti (matter) and Purusha (consciousness), she is bliss and non-bliss, from her emerged the Vedas and what is different from it, the born and the unborn, and all of the universe. She suggests that \\"Brahman and non-Brahman must be known\\", that she is all the five elements, as well as all that is different from these elements, what is above, what is below, what is around, and thus the universe in its entirety. Contents =Who is the Goddess?= The Devi Upanishad opens with a gathering of gods, who ask, \\"Great Goddess, who are you?\\" The Devi asserts that she is Svarupini – identical in form to – Brahman. In verses 2 and 3, states Thomas B. Coburn, Devi explains her forms of nirguna (without attributes) and suguna (with attributes), the true being (Sat), the consciousness (Citta) and the bliss (Anand). The verses 2 and 3 further assert that she is the universe, the Prakrti (nature) and Purusha (consciousness), the knowledge and ignorance, Brahman and Non-Brahman, the Vedas and whatever is different from it, \\"the unborn and the born, I am below, above and around\\". In verses 4 and 5, the Devi Upanishad mirrors the opening verses of the Devi sukta hymn of the Rigveda. The first five verses of the Devi Upanishad resonate with ideas from the Mahanarayana Upanishad and the Shvetashvatara Upanishad. There, states June McDaniel – a Professor of Religious Studies,June McDaniel, Department of Religious Studies, College of Charleston (2015) the ideas of metaphysical reality called Brahman is in \\"everything below, around and above is her own personification\\". After suggesting in the first six verses that she is identical with Mahadevi, Durga, Kali, Mahalakshmi, Vaishnavi, Saraswati and all goddesses, Devi asserts that it is she to whom the oblations of any Yajna (fire rituals) reach.॥ देवी उपनिषत् ॥ Sanskrit text of Devi Upanishad, SanskritDocuments Archives (2009) In verse 7, with a hymn structure resonating with the Gayatri Mantra, the Devi states, that one who knows \\"my essence in the water of the inner sea\\", attains her. =Devi stuti and iconography= In verses 8 through 14, the gathered gods acknowledge Devi's answer. They accept, states Devi Upanishad, that she is the Shakti, the Maha-vidya (the great knowledge), the Vedas, the power of Vishnu, she is the inspirer, she is the reason that gods were born, she is the love in the universe, the primordial source of universe, the bearer of thunderbolt, the cave, the wind, the cloud, the enchanting, the power of Self. This part of the Upanishad is the same as the Devi Stuti in Devi Gita 1.44–1.48. Iconography found in sculpture and paintings of Devi as Durga, such as above from 11th century Nepal, is mentioned in the Devi Upanishad. In verse 15, in an iconographic description of the Great Goddess, the text states Devi carries a noose, a goad, a bow and arrow, and enchants all. According to verse 18, she is venerated because Devi is eight attendant deities of Indra (\\"Vasus\\"); the eleven Rudras; and the twelve Adityas or sun gods representing each month of a year. She represents all gods who consume the Vedic ritual drink Soma or those who choose not to. She is also all the goblins, the demons, the evil beings, the ghosts, the super-human and the semi-divine, the planets, stars and all that shines in the sky, she is time and its divisions, she is everything that was, is and will be in the universe. She is, states the text, the three Guṇas – Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. She is Prajapati, Indra and Manu. She is infinite, pure, Shiva, refuge and the giver of that which is good, states verse 19. In another iconic description, in verses 20 and 24, the texts says that she is seated in one's \\"lotus heart\\", adorned with a crescent moon, conjoined with fire, glowing like the early morning sun, propitious, armed with the \\"noose and goad\\", with expressions marking her benevolence and dissolving fears, and that she is three eyed, attired in red, tender, bestows all wishes to her devotees. =Epilogue= The Upanishad, in verses 26 to 28, asserts that Devi is \\"Unknowable, the Endless, the Incomprehensible, the Unknown, the One and the Many.\\" The Upanishad states that Devi is the fountainhead of all mantras. All knowledge is her inherent characteristic, beyond her there is nothing, she is the pilot of worldly life. In verses 29 to 32, the benefits of reciting this Upanishad, at specific times and days are explained. Reciting the Upanishad ten times removes all sins and obstacles; also prescribes recitation in the morning and evening hours to get the same benefits. Recitation at midnight makes one's speech perfect. Recitation during the consecration of an image of a deity imbibes the image with energy. Influence in Tantra The tantric aspect in this Upanishad, says McDaniel, is in the usage of the terms yantra, bindu, bija, mantra, shakti and chakra. The five verses from 8 to 12 form part of the Devi Stuti (in Devi Gita 1.44–48). This reflects the Vedicization of tantric nature of the Devi Upanishad, a fusion, which the author of the Devi Gita says \\"as one of those texts whose recitation is pleasing to her.\\" Her progeny through Shiva like Aditi and Skanda, her comradeship with goddesses like Saraswati and Lakshmi, her status as Maya (the empirical reality) and her representation of the wind, the cloud and Indra are all recalled in verses 8 to 14.

A skillful whistler could supposedly summon animals, communicate with supernatural beings, and control weather phenomena. Transcendental whistling is a common theme in Chinese literature, for instance Chenggong Sui's (3rd century) Xiaofu 嘯賦 \\"Rhapsody on Whistling\\" and Ge Fei 's (1989) Hūshào 忽哨 \\"Whistling\\" short story. The most famous transcendental whistlers lived during the 3rd century, including the last master Sun Deng, and two of the eccentric Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove, Ruan Ji and Ji Kang, all of whom were also talented zitherists. Terminology The Chinese language has two common words meaning \\"to whistle\\": xiào 嘯 or 啸 \\"whistle; howl; roar; wail\\" and shào 哨 \\"warble; chirp; whistle; sentry\\". Word usage of xiào 嘯 (first occurring in the c. 10th century BCE Shijing, below) is historically older than shào 哨 (first in the c. 2nd century BCE Liji describing a pitch-pot's \\"wry mouth\\", tr. Legge 1885: 397). Both Chinese characters are written with the mouth radical 口 and phonetic indicators of sù 肅 \\"shrivel; contract\\" and xiāo 肖 \\"like; similar\\". The 16-stroke character 嘯 has graphically simpler versions of 14-stroke 嘨 and 11-stroke 啸, and an ancient variant character xiao 歗 (with the yawn radical 欠). =Xiao= The etymology of Old Chinese *siûh 嘯 \\"to whistle: to croon\\" is sound symbolic, with cognates of Proto-Tibeto-Burman language *hyu or *huy \\"whistle\\" and Chepang language syu- \\"blow through (hand, etc.)\\" (Schuessler 2007: 422). This same onomatopoeic and semantic sù < *siuk 肅 \\"shrivel; contract\\" element is also used to write xiāo 簫 \\"bamboo flute\\" (with the bamboo radical ⺮), xiāoxiāo 蕭蕭 \\"rustling sound (of falling leaves); whistling (of wind); whinnying (of horses)\\" (with the plant radical 艹), and xiāoxiāo 瀟瀟 \\"whistling (of wind) and pattering (of rain)\\" (with the water radical 氵). The (121 CE) Shuowen Jiezi dictionary uses chuī 吟 \\"blow; puff; play (a wind instrument)\\" to explicate xiao; defining xiao 嘯 as 吹聲也 \\"to make sound by blowing\\", and xiao 歗 as 吟也 \\"to blow\\" (citing the Shijing 22, below). The semantic field of xiào in Modern Standard Chinese includes human whistling and singing (for instance, xiàojiào 嘯叫 \\"whistle\\", yínxiào 吟嘯 \\"sing in freedom; lament; sigh\\", xiàogē 嘯歌 \\"sing at full voice\\"), whistling sounds (hūxiào 呼嘯 \\"whistle; scream; whiz (arrow)\\", xiàoshēng 嘯聲 \\"whistle; squeak; squeal; howl\\", hǎixiào 海嘯 \\"tsunami; tidal wave\\"), animal sounds (hǔxiào 虎嘯 \\"tiger's roar\\", yuánxiào 猿嘯 \\"monkey's cry\\", xiàodiāo 嘯雕 \\"whistling kite\\"), Daoistic counterculture (xiào'ào 嘯傲 \\"be forthright in speech and action; be leisurely and carefree\\", xiào'àoshānquán 嘯傲山泉 \\"lead a hermit's life in the woods and by a stream\\", xiàojù shānlín 嘯聚山林 \\"form a band and take to the forests\\"), and the present Daoist transcendental whistling (chángxiào 長嘯 \\"utter a long and loud cry; whistle\\", yǎngtiānchángxiào 仰天長嘯 \\"cry out at length to heaven; make a long throaty noise in the open air\\"). Donald Holzman (2009: 151) says xiao \\"has a distracting range of meanings, clustered around the basic idea of 'producing sound through puckered lips', from the lion's roar to a man's whistling, passing through vocalization, chanting or wailing.\\" The Hanyu Da Cidian unabridged Chinese dictionary defines two meanings for chángxiào 长啸 or 長嘯: 大声呼叫，发出高而长的声音 \\"Call out in a loud voice, issue a long, high-pitched sound\\", and 撮口发出悠长清越的声音 \\"Protrude the lips and issue a long, drawn-out, clear, and far-carrying sound\\". While the English lexicon has diverse whistling vocabulary, such as whistled language and whistle register, it lacks a standard translation equivalent for Chinese changxiao, literally \\"long whistle/whistling\\". Direct translations fail to denote the word's supernatural aspects: \\"whistling without a break\\" (Giles 1948), \\"long whistle\\" (Kroll 1983), \\"prolonged whistle\\" (Egan 1994), and \\"long piercing whistle\\" (Hegel 1998). Explanatory translations are more meaningful to English readers; the commonly used \\"transcendental whistling\\" was coined by Victor Mair (1996, 1998) and adopted by other authors (e.g., Minford 2014—and many famous whistlers were xian \\"transcendents\\"). Some less common renderings are \\"cosmic 'whistling'\\" (Chan 1996), \\"Taoist mediative [sic] whistle\\" (Hegel 1998), and \\"cosmic whistle\\" (Varsano 1999). =Shao= The semantic field of shào includes whistling sounds and whistle instruments (for instance, hūshào 呼/忽/唿哨 \\"to whistle\\", húshào 胡哨 \\"a whistle signal\\", kǒushào(r) 口哨 \\"a whistle (instrument and sound)\\", shàozi 哨子 \\"a whistle\\"), birds (niǎoshào 鳥哨 \\"birdcall\\", shàoyīng 哨鷹 \\"chanting goshawk\\", gēshào 鴿哨 \\"whistle tied to a pigeon\\"), and (whistle-signaling) guards (shàobīng 哨兵 \\"sentinel; sentry; guard\\", fàngshào 放哨 \\"to stand sentry\\", liàowàngshào 瞭望哨 \\"watchtower; lookout post\\"). The common \\"whistle\\" term hūshào (for which hū can be written 呼 \\"exhale; shout\\", 忽 \\"disdainful; sudden\\", or 唿 \\"sad\\") refers to a type of shrill, forceful finger whistling that is often mentioned in traditional Chinese short stories and novels of the Ming and Qing periods as a kind of remote signaling or calling (Mair 1998:43). Textual examples The Chinese classics provide a means of tracing the semantic developments of xiao from \\"wail\\", to \\"call back\\", to \\"whistle\\". The earliest usages in the Western Zhou dynasty (1046–771 BCE) Shijing \\"Classic of Poetry\\" described the sound of women expressing high emotion or grief. The Warring States period (c. 475 – 221 BCE) Chuci \\"Songs of the South\\" used xiao and changxiao to mean a piercing whistle or call to summon back the spirit or a recently deceased person. The (1st century BCE) Liexian Zhuan \\"Collected Biographies of Transcendents\\" first associated transcendental whistling with Daoism, as represented by the Madman of Chu who mocked Confucius. During the Eastern Han (25–220 CE) and Jin dynasty (265–420) xiao and changxiao whistling became especially associated with Daoism. For example, the Hou Hanshu (82, tr. DeWoskin 1983: 77) biography of Xu Deng 徐登 mentions his companion Zhao Bing 趙柄 whistling to call up wind. \\"On another occasion, he was seeking passage across a river, but the boat man would not take him. [Bing] spread out a cloth and sat in the middle of it. Then with a long whistle he stirred up winds [長肅呼風] and whipped up wild currents which carried him across.\\" Later texts associated (chang)xiao transcendental whistling with Daoist inner-breath yoga techniques and qi- circulation. Daoist meditation and healing use a breathing technique called Liuqi fa 六氣法 \\"Method of the Six Breaths\\" that is practiced in various ways. The Six Breaths are si 嘶 \\"hissing with the lips wide and teeth together\\", he 呵 \\"guttural rasping with mouth wide open\\", hu 呼 \\"blowing out the breath with rounded lips\\", xu 嘘 \\"gently whistling with pursed lips\\", chui 吹 \\"sharply expelling the air with the lips almost closed\\", and xi 嘻 \\"sighing with mouth slightly open\\" (Kohn 2012: 233). Su (2006: 29, 32) calls the Six Dynasties (222-589) the \\"golden age of whistling\\". Xiao seems to have permeated all strata of Six Dynasties society, and practitioners included persons from almost all walks of life: recluses, hermit-scholars, generals, Buddhist monks, non-Chinese foreigners, women, high society elite, and Daoist priests. \\"In general, poets, hermits, and people of all types in the Six Dynasties utilized whistling to express a sense of untrammeled individual freedom, or an attitude of disobedience to authority or traditional ceremony, or to dispel suppressed feelings and indignation.\\" Ancient superstitions about whistling continue in Chinese folklore. In the present day, some Han Chinese consider it taboo to whistle in the house at night for fear of provoking ghosts, and similarly, the minority Maonan people and Kam people (mostly in South Central China) believe that whistling while working in the fields will invoke demons to damage the harvest (Su 2006: 28). =Shijing= The earliest recorded textual usage of xiao 嘯 or 歗 meant \\"wail\\" not \\"whistle\\". Three (c. 10th-7th century BCE) Shijing \\"Classic of Poetry\\" odes use xiao to describe heartbroken women expressing sadness. Since the ancient, lyrical language of the Shijing can be difficult to interpret, the English translations of James Legge (1976), Arthur Waley (1937), and Bernhard Karlgren (1950) are cited. Two odes use xiao 嘯 along with gē 歌 \\"sing; song\\". Ode 22 江有汜 \\"The Yangzi Splits and Joins\\" is interpreted as concubines who were not allowed to accompany their bride to her new home, [江有沱]之子歸不我過 不我過其嘯也歌, translated as: *Our lady, when she was married, would not come near us; Would not come near us, but she blew that feeling away, and sang. (Legge 1876: 33) *Our lady that went to be married, Did not move us with her. She did not move us with her, But in the end she has let us come. (Waley 1937: 74) *This young lady went to her new home, but she would not pass us on; She would not pass us on, but (now) crooningly she sings. (Karlgren 1950: 13) Waley says the last words \\"are certainly corrupt\\" and suggests 宿也可 \\"allow to lodge\\". Karlgren explains \\"She can do nothing but croon (wail) and resign herself to it.\\" Ode 229 \\"White Flowers\\" uses xiaoge to describe a wife whose husband is gone, 嘯歌傷懷念彼碩人: *I whistle and sing with wounded heart thinking of that great man. (Legge 1876) *Full of woe is this song I chant, Thinking of that tall man. (Waley 1937: 103) * I (crooningly) wailingly sing with pained bosom, I am thinking of that tall man. (Karlgren 1950: 182) These translators agree that ge means \\"sing; song\\" but differ over whether xiao means \\"whistle\\", \\"chant\\", and \\"croon; wail\\". Ode 69 \\"In the Midst of the Valley are Motherworts\\" uses the graphic variant xiao 歗, interpreted as \\"groan\\", \\"sob\\", or \\"weep\\", describing another separated couple, 有女仳離條其嘯矣: *There is a woman forced to leave her husband, Long-drawn are her groanings. (Legge 1876) *Bitterly she sobs, Faced with man's unkindness. (Waley 1937: 59) *There is a girl who has been rejected; long-drawn-out is her (crooning:) wailing. (Karlgren 1950: 47) Based on these Shijing contexts, (Su 2006: 16) says xiao means \\"to whistle\\" and is related to singing and chanting in general. Bernhard Karlgren's (1964: 104-105) detailed Shijing gloss concludes xiao means \\"wail; groan\\" instead of \\"whistle\\". The Han version commentary says xiao means 歌無章曲 \\"to sing without stanzas or (fixed) melody, i.e., \\"to croon\\", thus \\"When she croons she sings\\" = \\"crooningly she sings\\"; Zheng Xuan's commentary to the Mao version says it means 蹙口而出聲 \\"to compress the mouth and emit a sound\\", i.e., \\"to whistle\\", \\"When she whistles she sings (=) she whistles and sings\\". Zhu Xi says xiaohu 嘯呼 means sù or sòu 嗖 \\"wail; whiz\\". Karlgren notes that xiao can mean either \\"to whistle\\" or \\"to croon; to wail\\"; citing the Liji 不嘯不指 \\"He does not whistle, nor point with the finger\\" and Huainanzi 黃神嘯吟 \\"The yellow spirit wails and moans\\". Like the Shijing, Han and Six Dynasties texts frequently associated whistling with women expressing their sorrows. The Lienu zhuan \\"Biographies of Exemplary Women\\" (Su 2006: 17) has a story about a secretly wise \\"Girl from Qishi 漆室 in Lu\\" (modern Zoucheng, Shandong). The girl was leaning against a pillar and whistling [倚柱而嘯]. Her neighbor heard and asked if she was whistling sadly because she longed for a husband, which the neighbor offered to arrange. The girl answered that she was not worried about getting a husband, but was worried because the ruler of Lu was old and but the crown prince was still too young. As the girl feared, Lu fell into chaos and was invaded by neighboring states. =Chuci= The (c. 3rd century BCE-2nd century CE) Chuci \\"Songs of Chu\\" uses xiao to mean \\"call back (a dead person's soul)\\", monkey and tiger \\"calls; roars\\", and \\"whistle; call out\\". The earliest textual example of xiao meaning \\"to summon a spirit\\" is in the Zhaohun \\"Summons of the Soul\\", which describes a shamanistic ritual to resuscitate a recently deceased person by calling back their hun \\"spiritual soul that leaves the body after death\\", as opposed to their po \\"corporal soul that remains with the deceased corpse\\". This poem uses the compound xiàohū 嘯呼 with \\"shout; call\\" > O soul, come back! And enter the gate of the city. Skilled priests are there > who call you, walking backwards to lead you in. Qin basket-work, silk cords > of Qi, and silken banners of Zheng: All things are there proper for your > recall; and with long-drawn, piercing cries they summon the wandering soul > [永嘯呼些]. O soul, come back! Return to your old abode. (tr. Hawkes 1985: 105) Wang Yi’s commentary invokes yin and yang theory. \\"Xiao has yin characteristics, and hu has yang characteristics. Yang governs the hun spiritual soul, and yin governs the po animal soul. Thus, in order to summon the whole being, one must xiaohu. Karlgren (1964: 104-105) translates \\"Long- drawn I (croon:) wail\\". David Hawkes (1986: 219-220) notes that the Yili ritual handbook section on zhaohun \\"soul-summoning\\" does not mention the shamanistic xiao \\"whistling\\" found in the Chuci, and suggests that the Confucian ritualist who compiled the text \\"evidently did not expect this somewhat perfunctory soul-summoning to be successful.\\" The Yili says the soul- summoner should take a suit of clothing formerly worn by the deceased, climb a ladder to the roof, stretch out the clothes, get up on the roof ridge, and \\"call out three times in a loud voice, 'Ho, Such a One! Come back!\\" Then he hands the clothing down to an assistant, who puts it on the corpse for viewing, and then the summoner climbs back down. Zhaoyinshi \\"Summons for a Recluse\\" uses xiao describing the calls of yuanyou 猿狖 \\"gibbons\\". > The cassia trees grow thick In the mountain's recesses, Their branches > interlacing. The mountain mists are high, The rocks are steep. In the sheer > ravines The waters' waves run deep. Monkeys in chorus cry; Tigers and > leopards roar [猿狖群嘯兮虎豹原]. One has climbed up by the cassia boughs Who wishes > to tarry there. (tr. Hawkes 1985: 244) Miujian \\"Reckless Remonstrance\\" uses xiao for a tiger's \\"roar\\", among examples of ganying \\"correlative resonance\\". > Like sounds harmonize together; Creatures mate with their own kind. The > flying bird cries out to the flock; The deer calls, searching for his > friends. If you strike gong, then gong responds; If you hit jue, then jue > vibrates. The tiger roars, and the wind of the valley comes [虎嘯而谷風至兮]; The > dragon soars, and the radiant clouds come flying. (tr. Hawkes 1985: 257) Sigu \\"Sighing for Olden Times\\", which is attributed to the Chuci editor Liu Xiang, uses xiao meaning \\"whistle; call out\\". > I think how my homeland has been brought to ruin, And the ghosts of my > ancestors robbed of their proper service. I grieve that the line of my > father's house is broken; My heart is dismayed and laments within me. I > shall wander a while upon the sides of the mountain, And walk about upon the > river's banks. I shall look down, whistling, on the deep waters [臨深水而長嘯兮], > Wander far and wide, looking all about me. (tr. Hawkes 1985: 298) =Huainanzi= Liu An's (c. 139 BCE) Huainanzi \\"Masters of Huainan\\", which is a compendium of writings from various schools of Chinese philosophy, has two xiao \\"howl; wail; moan\\" usages, which clearly exclude \\"whistle\\" (Karlgren 1964: 105). The \\"Celestial Patterns\\" chapter uses xiao \\"roar\\" in a context giving examples of yin-yang ganying resonance, including the Chinese sun and moon mirrors yangsui 陽燧 \\"burning mirror\\" and fangzhu 方諸 \\"square receptacle\\". > Fire flies upward; water flows downward. Thus, the flight of birds is aloft; > the movement of fishes is downward. Things within the same class mutually > move one another; root and twig mutually respond to each other. Therefore, > when the burning mirror sees the sun, it ignites tinder and produces fire. > When the square receptacle sees the moon, it moistens and produces water. > When the tiger roars, the valley winds rush [虎嘯而穀風至]; when the dragon > arises, the bright clouds accumulate. When qilins wrangle, the sun or moon > is eclipsed; when the leviathan dies, comets appear. When silkworms secrete > fragmented silk, the shang string [of a stringed instrument] snaps. When > meteors fall, the Bohai surges upward. (3.2, tr. Major et al. 2010: 116) The Huainanzi \\"Surveying Obscurities\\" chapter uses xiao \\"moan\\" referring to people suffering under the legendary tyrant Jie of Xia. > Beauties messed up their hair and blackened their faces, spoiling their > appearance. Those with fine voices filled their mouths with charcoal, kept > their [talent] shut away, and did not sing. Mourners did not [express] the > fullness of grief; hunters did not obtain any joy [from it]. The Western > Elder snapped her hair ornament; the Yellow God sighed and moaned [黃神嘯吟]. > (6., tr. Major et al. 2010: 227) The honorific names Xilao 西老 \\"Western Elder\\" and Huangshen 黃神 \\"Yellow God\\" refer to the Queen Mother of the West and Yellow Emperor. =Liexian zhuan= The Daoist Liexian Zhuan \\"Collected Biographies of Transcendents\\", edited by Liu Xiang (c. 79-8 BCE), uses changxiao in the hagiography of Lu Tong 陸通 (better known as Lu Jieyu, or Jie Yu 接輿, the madman of Chu). The story of Lu Jieyu meeting Confucius (551-479 BCE) is well known. The first version is in the Confucian Lunyu. > Chieh Yü, the madman of Ch'u, came past Master K'ung, singing as he went: > \\"Oh phoenix, phoenix How dwindled is your power! As to the past, reproof is > idle, But the future may yet be remedied. Desist, desist! Great in these > days is the peril of those who fill office.\\" Master K'ung got down [from his > carriage], desiring to speak with him; but the madman hastened his step and > got away, so that Master K'ung did not succeed in speaking with him. (tr. > Waley 1938: 219) The Daoist Zhuangzi gives an anti-Confucian version. > When Confucius went to Ch'u, Chieh Yü, the madman of Ch'u, wandered about > before his gate, saying: \\"Phoenix! Oh, Phoenix! How your virtue has > declined! The future you cannot wait for, The past you cannot pursue. When > the Way prevails under heaven, The Sage seeks for accomplishment; When the > Way is absent from the world, The sage seeks but to preserve his life. In an > age like that of today, All he can hope for is to avoid punishment. …\\" (tr. > Mair 1994: 40-41) The Liexian zhuan entry about the feigned \\"madman\\" says. > Lu Tong was the madman of Chu, Jieyu. He loved nourishing life, his food was > beggarticks, wax-myrtles, and turnips. Lu traveled to famous mountains, and > was sighted over many generations on the peak of Mount Emei, where he lived > for several hundred years before departing. Jieyu delighted in talking about > nourishing the inner nature and concealing one's brilliance. His custom was > to mock Confucius, and proclaim a decline in [the virtue of] the phoenix. He > matched breaths with harmony and cherished the abstruse. He strode across > lofty mountains, and transcendentally whistled on Mount Emei. [陸通者雲楚狂接輿也 > 好養生食橐廬木實及蕪菁子 游諸名山在蜀峨嵋山上世世見之歷數百年去 接輿樂道養性潛輝 風諷尼父諭以鳳衰 納氣以和存心以微 高步靈岳長嘯峨嵋] =Xiaofu= The Xiaofu 嘯賦 \\"Rhapsody on Whistling\\" was written by Chenggong Sui 成公綏 (231-273), a renowned Jin dynasty (265-420) author of fu \\"rhapsody; poetic exposition\\" rhymed prose. The Heian period scholar-official Sugawara no Kiyotomo's (814) Ryōunshū poetry collection includes his Japanese Shōfu 嘯賦 \\"Rhapsody on Whistling\\" (Su 2006: 41). The (648) Book of Jin (92) biography of Chenggong Sui is the primary source about his life and writing the prose-poem Xiaofu. Sui, whose courtesy name was Zi'an 子安, was a native of Boma 白馬 in the Eastern Commandery 東郡 (present day Hua County, Henan). As a youth, he read widely in the classics, and had a great talent for writing beautiful fu. Sui especially loved musical temperament [音律]. Once during hot weather, he received instruction/enlightenment from the wind and whistled [承風而嘯], making his tune cool and clear [泠然成曲]. Following this, he composed the Hsiao fu [… quoting full text]. The poet-official Zhang Hua regarded Chenggong Sui's writings as peerless and recommended him as an official. Sui served as Chancellor to the Minister of Ceremonies and Palace Writer Attendant. He died in 273 at the age of 43. The Rhapsody on Whistling begins with an idealized recluse who retires from the world with a group of friends to learn Daoist secrets through techniques of transcendental whistling, with which the whistler expresses his disdain toward the vulgar world, and releases his indignation and suffering (Su 2006: 37). > The secluded gentleman, In sympathy with the extraordinary, And in love with > the strange, Scorns the world and is unmindful of prestige. He breaks away > from human endeavor and leaves it behind. He gazes up at the lofty, longing > for the days of old; He ponders lengthily, his thoughts wandering afar. He > would Climb Mount Chi, in order to maintain his moral integrity; Or float on > the blue sea to wander with his ambition. So he invites his trusted friends, > Gathering about himself a group of like-minded. He gets at the essence of > the ultimate secret of life; He researches the subtle mysteries of Tao and > Te. He regrets that the common people are not yet enlightened; He alone, > transcending all, has prior awakening. He finds constraining the narrow road > of the world – He gazes up at the concourse of heaven, and treads the high > vastness. Distancing himself from the exquisite and the common, he abandons > his personal concerns; Then, filled with noble emotion, he gives a long- > drawn whistle [乃慷慨而長嘯]. Thereupon, The dazzling spirit inclines its luminous > form, Pouring its brilliance into Vesper's Vale. And his friends, rambling > hand in hand, Stumble to a halt, stepping on their toes. He sends forth > marvelous tones from his red lips, And stimulates mournful sounds from his > gleaming teeth. The sound rises and falls, rolling in his throat. The breath > rushes out and is repressed, then flies up like sparks [氣衝鬱而熛起]. He > harmonizes [the notes of the Chinese pentatonic scale] 'golden kung' with > 'sharp chiao,' Blending shang and yü into 'flowing chih.' The whistle floats > like a wandering cloud in the grand empyrean, And gathers a great wind for a > myriad miles. When the song is finished, and the echoes die out, It leaves > behind a pleasure that lingers on in the mind. Indeed, whistling is the most > perfect natural music, Which cannot be imitated by strings or woodwinds. > Thus, the Whistler Uses no instrument to play his music, Nor any material > borrowed from things. He chooses it from the near-at-hand—his own Self, And > with his mind he controls his breath [役心御氣]. (tr. White 1994: 429-430) In this context, Mair (1994: 430) notes that shen 身 \\"body; person\\" means \\"Self\\" in the sense of Daoist meditation. \\"The whistler finds the music and the means of producing it within himself … Everything is available within the Self. The breath and the mind are closely linked. By cultivating the flow of his attention, he simultaneously gains control over the flow of his breath.\\" The Rhapsody then elaborates on transcendental whistling. It spontaneously harmonizes with the world, \\"For every category he has a song; To each thing he perceives, he tunes a melody.\\"; \\"Thus, the Whistler can Create tones based on the forms, Compose melodies in accordance to affairs; Respond without limit to the things of Nature.\\" (tr. White 1994: 430, 432). The marvelous sounds affect both the whistler, \\"Pure, surpassing both reed and mouth-organ; Richly harmonious with lute and harp. Its mystery is subtle enough to unfold fully pure consciousness and enlighten creative intelligence.\\"; and the listener, \\"Though you be lost in thoughts, it can bring you back to your Mind; Though you be distressed, it will never break your Heart.\\" (tr. White 1994: 431). > Should he then Imitate gong and drum, or mime clay vessels and gourds; here > is a mass of sound like many instruments playing – Like reed pipe and flute > of bamboo [xiao 簫] – Bumping boulders trembling, An horrendous crashing, > smashing, breaking. Or should he Sound the tone chih, then severe winter > becomes steaming hot; Give free play to yü, then a sharp frost makes summer > fade; Move into shang, then a long autumn rain appears to fall in > springtime; Strike up the tone chiao, then a vernal breeze soughs in the > bare branches. (tr. White 1994: 433) Chenggong Sui obviously understood the technical aspects of the pentatonic scale and the relationship of musical notes and pitch standards (Goodman 2010: 139). The Rhapsody on Whistling concludes by describing famous musicians, singers, and animals all enthralled by hearing the whistler's performance, and uses changxiao again, \\"They understand the magnificent beauty of the long- drawn Whistle [乃知長嘯之奇妙]; Indeed, this is the most perfect of sounds.\\" (tr. White 1994: 434). This prose-poem has many Daoist elements besides researching \\"the subtle mysteries of Tao and Te\\" (above). Transcendental whistling is presented as a powerful method of self-cultivation through breath control. The statement that \\"with his mind he controls his breath\\" uses the Daoist term yùqì 御氣 \\"control the breath; move qi through the body\\", further described as, > The [eight] sounds and [five] harmonies constantly fluctuate; The melody > follows no strict beat. It runs, but does not run off. It stops, but does > not stop up. Following his mouth and lips, he expands forth. Floating on his > fragrant breath, he wanders afar [假芳氣而遠逝]. The music is, in essence, subtle > with flowing echoes. The sound races impetuously, but with a harsh clarity. > Indeed, with its supreme natural beauty, It is quite strange and other- > worldly. (tr. White 1994: 434) Fangqi 芳氣 \\"fragrant breath\\" is a Daoist metaphor for meide 美德 \\"beautiful virtues\\". =Shenxian zhuan= Ge Hong's (c. 4th century) Daoist Shenxian zhuan \\"Biographies of Divine Transcendents\\" has two hagiographies that mention supernatural whistling powers; Liu Gen 劉根 could summon ghosts, and Liu Zheng 劉政 could summon powerful winds. First, the hagiography of the Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) fangshi Liu Gen 劉根 says he saved himself from punishment by changxiao whistling to summon the prosecutor's family ghosts who insisted on his freedom. > Liu Gen, styled Jun'an 君安, was a native of the capital at Chang'an. As a > youth he understood the Five Classics. During the second year of the suihe > period of Han Emperor Cheng's reign [7 BCE], he was selected as a Filial and > lncorrupt and was made a Gentleman of the Interior. Later he left the world > behind and practiced the Way. He entered a cave on Mount Songgao that was > situated directly above a sheer cliff over fifty thousand feet high. Winter > or summer, he wore no clothing. The hair on his body grew one to two feet > long. … Commandant Zhang, the new governor, took Liu Gen to be a fake, and > he sent lictors to summon him, plotting to have him killed. … The commandant > ordered over fifty men brandishing swords and pikes to tie Liu up and stand > him at attention. Liu's face showed no change in color. The commandant > interrogated Liu as follows: \\"So, do you possess any arts of the Dao?\\" > \\"Yes.\\" \\"Can you summon ghosts?\\" \\"I can.\\" \\"Since you can,\\" said the > commandant, \\"you will bring ghosts before this chamber bench at once. If you > do not, I will have you tortured and killed.\\" Liu replied, \\"Causing ghosts > to appear is quite easy.\\" Liu Gen borrowed a brush and an inkstone and > composed a memorial. [In a moment,] a clanging sound like that of bronze or > iron could be heard outside, and then came a long whistling sound, extremely > plangent [因長嘯嘯音非常清亮]. All who heard it were awestruck [聞者莫不肅然], and the > visitors all shook with fear. In another moment, an opening several dozen > feet wide appeared in the south wall of the chamber, and four hundred or > five hundred armored troops could be seen passing orders down the lines. > Several dozen crimson-clad swordsmen then appeared, escorting a carriage > straight through the opened wall into the chamber. The opened wall then > returned to its former state. Liu Gen ordered the attendants to present the > ghosts. With that, the crimson-clad guards flung back the shroud covering > the carriage to reveal an old man and an old woman tightly bound inside. > They hung their heads before the chamber bench. Upon examining them closely, > the commandant saw that they were his deceased father and mother. Shocked > and dismayed, he wept and was completely at a loss. The ghosts reprimanded > him, saying, \\"When we were alive, you had not yet attained office, so we > received no nourishment from your salary. Now that we are dead, what do you > mean by offending a venerable official among divine transcendents and > getting us arrested? After causing such a difficulty as this, aren't you > ashamed even to stand among other people?\\" The commandant came down the > steps and knocked his head on the ground before Liu Gen, saying that he > deserved to die and begging that his ancestors be pardoned and released. Liu > ordered the five hundred troops to take out the prisoners and release them. > As the carriage moved out, the wall opened back up; then, when it was > outside, the wall closed again and the carriage was nowhere to be seen. Liu > had also disappeared. (tr. Campany 2002: 240-242) Robert Ford Campany notes, \\"The whistlers may be not the ghosts of the departed but the spirit-officials who are ushering them along. Esoteric techniques of whistling numbered among Daoist arts.\\" In the History of the Latter Han version of this story, it is Liu Gen himself who does the xiao rather than changxiao whistling. > Liu Gen was a native of Yingchuan. He dwelt in seclusion on Mount Song. > Curiosity seekers came from afar to study the Dao with him. The Governor Shi > Qi 史祈 took him for a charlatan and had him arrested and brought in to his > offices. He questioned him, saying, \\"What arts do you have, that you mislead > and deceive the people so? You will perform a confirmatory feat, or else you > will die at once.\\" Liu said, \\"I truly have no unusual powers, except that I > have some small ability to cause people to see ghosts.\\" \\"Summon one right > now,\\" Shi said, \\"so that I can see it with my own eyes, and only then will I > take it as clearly established.\\" At this, Liu Gen looked to the left and > whistled [左顧而嘯]. In a moment, Shi's deceased father, along with several > dozen of his departed relatives, appeared before them, bound. They knocked > their heads on the ground toward Liu and said, \\"Our son has acted wrongly > and should be punished!\\" Then they turned to Shi Qi and said, \\"As a > descendant, not only do you bring no benefit to your ancestors, but you > bring trouble to us departed spirits!

Suddenly he [and the > ghosts] all vanished. (tr. Campany 2002: 249) Second, the hagiography of Liu Zheng 劉政, who lived to an age of more than 180 years, uses chuīqì 吹氣 \\"blow one's breath\\" to mean \\"whistle up (wind)\\". > Liu Zheng was a native of Pei. He was highly talented and broadly learned; > there was little his studies had not covered. … He lived for more than one > hundred eighty years, and his complexion was that of a youth. He could > transform himself into other shapes and conceal his form … Further, he was > capable of planting fruits of all types and causing them immediately to > flower and ripen so as to be ready to eat. He could sit down and cause the > traveling canteen to arrive, setting out a complete meal for up to several > hundred people. His mere whistling could create a wind to set dust swirling > and blow stones about [能吹氣為風飛沙揚石]. By pointing his finger he could make a > room or a mountain out of a gourd; when he wanted to tear it down, he simply > pointed again, and it would become as before. He could transform himself > into the form of a beautiful woman. He could create fire and water, travel > several thousand li in a single day, create clouds by breathing over water, > and make fog by raising his hands. (tr. Campany 2002: 322-323, cf. DeWoskin > 1983: 82-83) =Shishuo xinyu= The (5th century) Shishuo Xinyu version of this whistling story about Ruan Ji visiting the unnamed Sun Deng, referred to as the zhenren \\"perfected person\\" in the Sumen Mountains 蘇門山. > When Juan Chi whistled [嘯], he could be heard several hundred paces away. In > the Su-men Mountains (Honan) there appeared from nowhere a Realized Man [真人] > about whom the woodcutters were all relaying tales. Juan Chi went to see for > himself and spied the man squatting with clasped knees by the edge of a > cliff. Chi climbed the ridge to approach him and then squatted opposite him. > Chi rehearsed for him briefly matters from antiquity to the present, > beginning with an exposition of the Way of Mystical Quiescence [玄寂] of the > Yellow Emperor and Shen Nung, and ending with an investigation of the > excellence of the Supreme Virtue [盛德] of the Three Ages (Hsia, Shang, and > Chou). But when Chi asked his opinion about it he remained aloof and made no > reply. Chi then went on to expound that which lies beyond Activism [有為之教], > and the techniques of Resting the Spirit [棲神] and Conducting the Vital Force > [導氣]. But when Chi looked toward him for a reply, he was still exactly as > before, fixedly staring without turning. Chi therefore turned toward him and > made a long whistling sound [長嘯]. After a long while the man finally laughed > and said, \\"Do it again.\\" Chi whistled a second time [復嘯], but as his > interest was now exhausted, he withdrew. He had returned about half-way down > the ridge when he heard above him a shrillness like an orchestra of many > instruments, while forests and valleys reechoed with the sound. Turning back > to look, he discovered it was the whistling of the man he had just visited > [向人嘯]. (49, tr. Mather 1976: 331) Holzman (2009: 152) says that when Ruan Ji whistles, Sun Deng realizes that he is \\"not merely a pedant, but also an adept of an art that imitates nature, that he is able to control his breath so as to make it resemble that very breath of heaven.\\" The Shishuo xinyu commentary by Liu Xiaobiao quotes two texts. First, the (4th century) Wei Shi Chunqiu 魏氏春秋 version says, > Juan Chi often went riding alone wherever his fancy led him, not following > the roads or byways, to the point where carriage tracks would go no farther, > and always he would return weeping bitterly. Once while he was wandering in > the Su-men Mountains there was a recluse living there whose name no one > knew, and whose only possessions were a few hu-measures of bamboo fruit, a > mortar and pestle, and nothing more. When Juan Chi heard of him he went to > see him and began conversing on the Way of Non-action [無為] of high > antiquity, and went on to discuss the moral principles [義] of the Five > Emperors and Three August Ones. The Master of Su-men remained oblivious and > never even looked his way. Chi then with a shrill sound made a long > whistling whose echoes reverberated through the empty stillness. The Master > of Su-men finally looked pleased and laughed. After Chi bad gone down the > hill, the Master gathered his breath and whistled shrilly with a sound like > that of the phoenix. Chi had all his life been a connoisseur of music, and > he borrowed the theme of his discussion with the Master of Su-men to express > what was in his heart in a song, the words of which are: \\"The sun sets west > of Mt. Pu-chou; The moon comes up from Cinnabar Pool. Essence of Yang is > darkened and unseen; While Yin rays take their turn to win. His brilliance > lasts but for a moment; her dark will soon again be full. If wealth and > honor stay but for a trice must poverty and low estate be evermore?\\" (tr. > Mather 1976: 331-332) Second, the Zhulin Qixian Lun 竹林七賢論 (tr. Mather 1976: 332), by Dai Kui 戴逵 (d. 396) explains, \\"After Juan Chi returned (from the Su-men Mountains) he proceeded to compose the \\"Discourse on Mr. Great Man\\" [大人先生論]. What was said in this discourse all represented the basic feelings in his breast and heart. The main point was that Mr. Great Man was none other than Juan himself.\\" In addition, the Shishuo xinyu biography of Liu Daozhen 劉道真 says he was \\"good at singing and whistling [善歌嘯]\\". =Jin shu= Two chapters in the (648) Book of Jin record the meeting between Ruan Ji and Sun Deng. Ruan Ji's biography (in chapter 49, Biographies) uses changxiao and xiao to describe his visit with Sun Deng. > Once [Juan] Chi met Sun Teng on Su-men Mountain [蘇門山]. [Juan Chi] touched on > topics of ancient times, and on the arts of \\"posing the spirit\\" and \\"leading > the breath\\" [棲神導氣之術]. [Sun] Teng kept silent throughout. As a result, [Juan] > Chi expelled a long whistle [籍因長嘯而退], and took his leave. When he had > descended halfway down the mountain, he heard a sound like the cry of the > phoenix resounding throughout the peaks and valleys. It was the whistling of > [Sun] Teng [乃登之嘯也]. (tr. Varsano 1999: 56) Varsano (1999: 57) explains this transcendental whistling as a direct representation of the ineffable Dao, \\"his superhuman whistle, a primordial sound that does not describe the secrets of the universe, but incarnates it.\\" Sun Deng's biography (94, Hermits and Recluses) does not mention xiao whistling, but this chapter uses xiao in the biography of Tao Qian 陶潛 [登東皋以舒嘯] and changxiao in that of Xia Tong 夏統 [集氣長嘯]. The Jin shu account of Sun Deng says, > Sun Teng, whose tzu was Kung-ho [公和], was a man of Kung in Chi commandery. > He was homeless, but stayed in the mountains in the north of the commandery > where he lived in a cavern in the earth that he had made for himself. In > summer he wove grasses to wear as a shirt and in winter he let his hair down > to cover himself. He liked to read the I ching and played a one-stringed > zither [一絃琴]. All those who saw him felt friendly towards him and took > pleasure in his company. There was not an ounce of hatred or anger in him. > He was one thrown into the water to arouse his anger, but he just came out > and broke into an enormous guffaw. From time to time he would wander among > men and some of the householders he passed would set out food and clothing > for him, now of which he would keep: when he had taken his leave he threw > them all away. Once when he went to the mountains at I-yang [宜陽山] he was > seen by some charcoal burners who knew he was not an ordinary man. But when > they talked to him, he did not answer. Wen-ti [Ssu-ma Chao] heard about it > and sent Juan Chi to investigate. (tr. Holzman 2009: 149-150) The context goes on to say that after Sun Deng refused to talk with Ruan Ji, Xi Kang followed Sun Deng travelling for three years. Since Sima Zhao became generalissimo in 255, Holzman dates Ruan Ji's visit around 257, and Xi Kang's around 258 to 260. Based on the different mountain names, Chan (1996: 151, 158) says Ruan Ji visited Sun Deng twice, first around 226-230, and then around 255-263; and dates Xi Kang's travels at around 249-251. The Jinshu biography of Liu Kun 劉琨, the Governor of Bingzhou 并州 (modern Shanxi), records that once when the capital Jinyang was under siege by an army of Xiongnu cavalry, Liu supposedly ended the siege by giving a qingxiao 清嘯 \\"clear whistle\\" and playing a hujia \\"a Mongolian double-reed instrument\\". \\"Liu Kun ascended a tall building by moonlight and emitted a clear xiao [清嘯]. When the Xiongnu soldiers heard it, they sighed sadly. In the middle of the night he played the hujia [a kind of oboe originating on the steppes, perhaps the predecessor of the sona]; the Xiongnu became homesick on hearing it. He played again at dawn and he Xiongnu lifted the siege and left.\\" (tr. Watt and Harper 2004: 8). =Xiaozhi= The anonymous (c. 8th century) Xiaozhi 嘯旨 \\"Principles of Whistling\\" is included in several collections of Tang dynasty literature, such as the Tangdai congshu 唐代叢書. According to the (c. 800) Fengshi wenjian ji 封氏聞見記, written by Feng Yan 封演, the Xiaozhi was written in 765 by a judge Sun Guang 孫廣, who is otherwise unknown. The titular word zhǐ 旨 means \\"intention; aim; meaning\\", and the translator E. D. Edwards (1957: 218) says the text is about \\"How to Whistle\\". Paul W. Kroll (1983: 250) translates Xiaozhi as \\"Directives on Whistling\\". There are two theories regarding the origin of the \\"Principles of Whistling\\" (Edwards 1957: 217). The first is that during the Six Dynasties (220-589) period, some people opposed to Confucianism went into the mountains and did what they liked, including as, for example whistling, since Confucius looked down on those who whistled (e.g., Liji). The other is the Daoist theory, which is more probable since the Xiaozhi frequently mentions Dao. The Daoists believed that breathing the breath of Nature was one means of gaining immortality, and by whistling they were breathing in accord with Nature, and therefore they came nearer to Immortality. The Xiaozhi Preface begins with a definition that semantically expands xiao from \\"moan; call out\\" and \\"call back (a soul)\\" to a new meaning of \\"communicating (with the Daoist gods and spirits)\\". > Air forced outwards from the throat and low in key is termed speech; forced > outwards from the tongue and high in key is termed hsiao (whistling). The > low key of speech is sufficient for the conduct of human affairs, for the > expression of our natural feelings; the high key of whistling can move > supernatural beings and is everlasting. Indeed, though a good speaker can > win response from a thousand li, a good whistler commands the attention of > the whole world of spirits. (tr. Edwards 1957: 218-219) Donald Holzman (2009: 152) translates this as \\"a sound produced by breath striking against the tip of the tongue … a method of communicating with the spirits and achieving immortality\\", and comments, \\"Whatever whistling did signify, the important thing to note is that it was an unintellectual art, probably a fairly strange kind of sound divorced from speech and reason.\\" The Preface then outlines a Daoist mytho-history of xiao transmission. > Laozi transmitted it to Queen Mother of the West, she to the Perfected > Person of the South Polar Star 南極真人 [controller of human longevity], he to > Guangchengzi, he to the wind god Feng Bo, and he to Xiaofu 嘯夫 Father of > Whistling. Father of Whistling taught it to [7-inch-tall] Wu Guang 務光, he to > Emperor Yao, and Yao to Emperor Shun, who invented the zither. Shun > transmitted whistling to Yu the Great, after whom the art declined until it > was revived by the Jin dynasty (265–420) Daoist transcendent Sun Gong 孫公 of > Mt. Taihang who obtained the technique, achieved the Way, and disappeared > without teaching it to anyone. Ruan Ji had a smattering knowledge of the art > but after him it was lost and no longer heard (adapted from Edwards 1957: > 219-220). The Shanhaijing (tr. Birrell 2000:24) says, \\"In appearance, Queen Mother of the West looks like a human, but she has a leopard's tail and the fangs of a tigress, and she is good at whistling. She wears a victory crown on her tangled hair.\\" The Shanghaijing using xiao for the tiger-like Queen Mother's \\"whistling\\" parallels the Huainanzi using it for a tiger's \\"howl\\" (Su 2006: 19). The Liexian Zhuan lists the Father of Whistling, who could control fire, but does not mention whistling. The Xiaozhi 嘯旨 has fifteen sections. Section 1 \\"First Principles\\" tells how to practice whistling, for instance, \\"regulate the respiration, correct the relative positions of lips and teeth, compose the sides of the mouth, relax the tongue, practise in some retired spot.\\" It also gives twelve specific whistling techniques, such as (tr. Edwards 1957: 220-221), Waiji 外激— \\"Place the tongue in close contact with the inside of the upper teeth. Open wide both lips and force the breath outwards, letting the sound go out.\\"; and Neiji 內激—\\"Place the tongue as before; close both lips, compressing them to a point, like the opening of a stalk of wheat. Pass the breath through, making the sound go inwards.\\" Titles of subsequent sections are either poetic descriptions of tunes, e.g., \\"Tiger in a Deep Ravine\\" (3), \\"Night Demons in a Lonely Wood\\" (5), and \\"Snow Geese and Swans Alighting\\" (7); or references to famous historical whistlers, e.g., \\"Su Men [Mountains]\\" (11) was transmitted by Sun Deng, and \\"The Loose Rhymes of Ruan\\" was composed by Ruan Ji (both mentioned above). The Xiaozhi explains and describes each whistling tune. Take, for example, \\"Su Men\\", which retells the story of Sun Deng and Ruan Ji (above), but with whistling instead of zither playing. > The 'Su Men' was composed by the Taoist Immortal Recluse, who lived in the > Su Men Mountains (of Honan). The Holy One transmitted, he did not make it. > The Immortal transmitted (the music of) Kuang Ch'eng and Wu Kuang 務光 in > order to rejoice the spirit and expand the Tao. He did not regard music as > the main task. In olden days there were those who roved in Su Men listening > to the phoenix' songs. The notes were exquisitely clear, very different from > the so-called pretended phoenix. The phoenix makes sounds but humans cannot > hear them. How then can the Su Family know the sound of the phoenix? > Hereafter, when seeking the sound, bring up the Immortal's whistle. The > Immortal's whistle does not stop at fostering the Tao and gratifying the > spirits; for indeed, in everyday affairs it brings harmony into the world, > and peace in season. In oneself the Tao never dies, in objective matters it > assists all that is sacred, and conducts the Five Influences. In the arcana > of Nature order prevails. For success in obtaining response (to such > efforts) nothing approaches music. The Immortal has evolved the one > successful form. As to all wild things whistling is the one thing needful. > Yuan Szu-tsung of Chin (Yuan Chi) was a fine whistler. Hearing that the > Immortal thought himself his equal, he (Yuan) went to visit him. The > Immortal remained seated with his hair in disorder. Yuan bowed repeatedly > and inquired after his health. Thrice and again thrice he addressed his > (uncivil) host. The Immortal maintained his attitude and made no response. > Chi then whistled some score of notes and left. The Immortal, estimating > that his guest had not gone far, began to whistle the Ch'ing Chueh [清角] to > the extent of four or five movements. But Chi perceived that the mountains > and all growing things took on a different sound. Presently came a fierce > whirlwind with pelting rain, followed by phoenixes and peacocks in flocks; > no one could count them. Chi was alarmed, but also pleased, and he returned > home and wrote down the story. He obtained only two-tenths of it, and called > it 'Su Men'. This is what they tell there. The motif of the song is lofty > mountains and wide marshes, great heights and distances. (tr. Edwards 1957: > 226) The Xiaozhi explains the essence of xiao whistling in the \\"Fleeting Cloud\\" (section 6, tr. Edwards 1957: 222-223), \\"The lute suits southern manners; the reed-organ suits the cry of the phoenix; the fife suits the dragon's drone. Every musical sound has its counterpart (in nature). So, the roar of the tiger and the drone of a dragon all have a proper sequence of notes.\\" Transcendental whistling evokes the sounds of nature. Ronald Egan (1994: 248) describes changxiao as \\"a well-known method, associated with Taoist practices, by which the devotee prepares his own mind for the experience of nature and, simultaneously, attempts to elicit a sympathetic reaction\\" from nature. \\"Standard Notes\\" (14, tr. Edwards 1957: 227) mentions Daoist immortality, \\"In comparatively modern days, Sun Kung [Sun Deng] was successful, but people did not listen. As to peaceful notes [平和], they stave off old age and do not allow one to die. These Standard notes are known about, but the notes themselves are lost.\\" The last \\"Conclusion\\" section (15, tr. Edwards 1957: 228) says, \\"The conclusion is at the extremities of the [pentatonic] scale, the end of the Great Tao. After the days of Yao and Shun there was some idea of these notes, but the actual notes were lost.\\" The Conclusion includes a (1520) colophon written by Ming dynasty scholar Geng Chen, who describes the book as exceedingly rare, and probably written by someone during the Tang dynasty. > The preface says, \\"the (Western) Queen Mother taught the Fairy of the South > Polar Star; he passed it on to Kuang Ch'eng-tzu\\". This is extravagant talk, > and not usually accepted. But the twelve methods are found in Sun Teng and > Yuan Chi [i.e., Ruan Ji], so that we can truly say we have the general > purport of Whistling. The Preface also says that Sun Teng did not hand on > (the gift) to anyone, and after Yuan Chi it disappeared and was no more > heard. … Now the voice of man is the voice of the universe (nature). Man may > be ancient or modern, but sound is eternal, never new or old. Now this book > is going forth and who knows whether a Sun or Yuan may not appear in some > mountains or woods and, that being so, who can say that there is an end to > Whistling? (tr. Edwards 1957: 228) The Xiaozhi houxu 肅旨後序 \\"Postface to the Principles of Whistling\\", written by the Ming dynasty scholar and artist Tang Yin (1470-1524), compares the non- verbal art of xiao whistling with a Daoist priest's secret incantation and a Buddhist monk's magical formula in Sanskrit (Su 2006: 43). =Tang poetry= Tang poetry is renowned in history of Chinese literature. Kroll (1983: 250) says many medieval poems mention changxiao \\"long whistling\\", but translators generally convert it into a dull \\"humming.\\" In the extensive Quan Tangshi collection of Tang poetry, xiao occurs in 385 poems, and changxiao in 89. For one example, the famous poet Li Bai (701-762) wrote six poems entitled \\"Wandering on Mount Tai\\", the first of which uses changxiao. > Climbing to the heights, I gaze afar at P'eng and Ying; The image > imagined—the Terrace of Gold and Silver. At Heaven's Gate, one long whistle > I give, And from a myriad li the clear wind comes. Jade maidens, four or > five persons, Gliding and whirling descend from the Nine Peripheries. > Suppressing smiles, they lead me forward by immaculate hands, And let fall > to me a cup of fluid aurora! I bow my head down, salute them twice, Ashamed > for myself not to be of a transcendent's caliber.—But broad-ranging enough > now to make the cosmos dwindle, I'll leave this world behind, oh how far > away! (tr. Kroll 1983: 249) =Hushao= The preeminent Chinese avant-garde author Ge Fei wrote the (1995) Hūshào 忽哨 \\"Whistling\\" short story, using the modern \\"whistle\\" term with shào 哨 instead of xiào 嘯 in Xiaofu, Xiaozhi, etc. The two main characters are based on the historical figures Sun Deng and Ruan Ji who were proficient in transcendental whistling. Victor Mair, who translated \\"Whistling\\" into English, says > An old legend of the celebrated encounter between the two men has Ruan Ji > visiting Sun Deng in his hermitage but not receiving any responses to his > questions. Thereupon, he withdraws and, halfway up a distant mountain, lets > out a loud, piercing whistle. This is followed by Sun Deng's magnificent > whistled reply, which inspires Ruan Ji to write the \\"Biography of Master > Great Man,\\" an encomium in praise of the Taoist \\"true man\\" that also > satirizes the conventional Confucian \\"gentleman\\". (1998:43) \\"Whistling\\" tells how the famous poet Ruan Ji regularly came to visit the aged hermit Sun Deng on Su Gate Mountain 蘇門山 in present-day Henan, and play games of weiqi go. During one go game, Sun was silently pondering how to move a piece, and Ruan surprised him. \\"When the whistling sound suddenly arose, Sun Deng was totally unprepared for it. The strange, strident sound, mixed with the sounds of the billowing pines, reverberated through the valleys of Su Gate Mountain for a long while without expiring.\\" (tr. Mair 1998:43). After a final game of go, Ruan took his leave from Sun owing to the \\"prolonged and profound silence that made him feel bored.\\" Sun watches Ruan's silhouette gradually dissolving into the dark green distance, > When the sound of whistling rose beneath the sunny empyrean, Sun Deng > shuddered as though it were a bolt out of the blue. Shielding his eyes from > the strong light with one hand, he saw Ruan Ji standing on the peak of Su > Gate Mountain beneath a solitary tree. Against a backdrop of white clouds > like thick cotton fleece, he stood motionless, seeing to wait for Sun Deng's > answer. Sun Deng looked all around him, then quietly inserted his thumb and > forefinger in his mouth—the extreme frailness of his body and the looseness > of his teeth caused him to be unable to produce any sound. The shrill, > desolate, plaintive whistle, accompanied by the soughing of the billowing > pines, reverberated for a long time in the mountain valleys. It was like the > sad wail of the poet who died long ago, penetrating through the barriers of > time, continuing up till today, and sinking into the easily awakened dreams > of a living person. (tr.

The catalyst event, extraction from her cell and being tasered while shackled, was captured on the video of the Fairfax County jail. During a team's efforts to extract the mentally ill prisoner, who resisted, they tasered her four times while she was restrained. No charges were filed against the deputies who tasered McKenna, but the case became the subject of a federal civil rights investigation because of several related issues.  Early life  At the age of 12, McKenna was diagnosed with schizophrenia, bi-polar disorder and depression. (Other sources say the diagnosis was made when she was 14 years old.) According to a family photograph, she was an honors graduate student from high school in Fairfax County. She had a 7-year-old daughter.  Event  McKenna, a 37-year old woman, was being held at the Fairfax County Adult Detention Center by the Fairfax County Police Department and Fairfax County Sheriff's Office in Fairfax County, Virginia, due to an outstanding warrant issued over her suspected attack on a police officer in Alexandria, Virginia. Fairfax County officials had notified Alexandria police, whom they expected to pick up the suspect. But, there was an unexplained week-long delay in their response, and Fairfax decided to transport the prisoner to Alexandria. They said her mental condition was deteriorating. In Alexandria, better assistance could be provided, namely, the resources (i.e., legal representation to petition for a mental health hold) that were required to be provided by the warrant-issuing city. Due to the previous assault charge against her, when McKenna was taken out of her cell, she was restrained with her arms behind her back and in handcuffs, her legs shackled, and a spit mask placed over her head. 17 minutes into the 45-minute struggle to extract her from her cell, McKenna, who was and tall, was tasered. A sheriff's deputy used a stun gun to taser her four times because she wouldn't bend her knees to be put into a wheeled restraint chair. Because she was classified as mentally ill, a specialized team was attempting to ready her for transport to Alexandria. The team was made up of six members of the Sheriff’s Emergency Response Team (\\"SERT\\"); they were dressed in full-body biohazard suits and gas masks. Shortly after being tasered, McKenna suffered cardiac arrest and lost consciousness. She was resuscitated by emergency responders while being taken to Inova Fairfax Hospital. There she was placed on life support. After five days, she was determined to be brain dead and was removed from life support. She was pronounced dead on February 8, 2015.  Response  The Fairfax County Sheriff Department, led by Sheriff Stacey Ann Kincaid, conducted an initial internal investigation. This was later assigned to the Fairfax County Police, which is responsible for investigations of prisoner deaths. There were no criminal charges filed against the officers involved in McKenna's death. The Virginia medical examiner's office made the determination that McKenna's cause of death was accidental, due to excited delirium, and that it was linked to the use of the stun gun. Use of the stun gun was questioned by her family and counsel as being an excessive use of force on a restrained person, a small woman. Following McKenna's death, the Fairfax County Sheriff's Office suspended such use of stun guns at the county jail in April 2015. The question of how police treat mentally ill prisoners became a focus of the discussion surrounding McKenna's death. The Sheriff’s Emergency Response Team (\\"SERT\\") records its work of cell extractions of inmates by video. The video of the incident related to McKenna was released by the Fairfax County Sheriff's office. The Commonwealth of Fairfax County released a 51-page report prepared by their attorney, Ray Morrogh.

The pairing is often consumed as a simple breakfast, and is often consumed in doughnut shops. Coffee is a brewed drink that is typically served hot. Doughnuts are sweet, deep fried desserts. The pairing may also be served and consumed as a refreshment. Coffee breaks are sometimes taken as a work break during the mid-morning or mid-afternoon \\"to consume coffee and doughnuts (or rolls).\\" In 1989, Harry Balzer, the chief industry analyst of the market research company NPD Group, stated that in the United States, 41–42% of all breakfasts included coffee and that 14.2% of all breakfasts included a doughnut. Coffee and doughnuts are sometimes provided as a part of events and fundraisers for various organizations, charities, groups and companies. Companies Some companies use the phrase \\"coffee and doughnuts\\" in their business name, such as Bob's Coffee and Doughnuts in Los Angeles, California. Krispy Kreme has provided free coffee and doughnuts in commemoration of National Coffee Day, and other companies have offered discounts or special offers in commemoration of the day. Tim Hortons is a Canadian multinational fast casual restaurant chain known for its coffee and doughnuts. In September 2015, Dunkin' Donuts, a doughnut and coffee shop chain, announced plans to move forward with a delivery program that includes delivery of coffee, doughnuts and other foods, to begin sometime in 2016. The delivery program is devised to use a mobile application for ordering products, and will be launched when the company updates its mobile application. The program was under consideration in June 2015. The New York Post reported that this was done in efforts to increase competition with Starbucks Coffee. Properties Coffee and doughnuts provide caffeine, and large amounts of fat and sugar. Venues In March 2013, it was reported that U.S. taxpayer money was funding the consumption of coffee, doughnuts, and other foods by U.S. lawmakers. Coffee and doughnuts are commonly served at twelve-step meetings, such as Alcoholics Anonymous. In language The English slang language terms \\"coffee-and\\" and \\"coffee-an\\" have been used in the 20th century as a noun to denote a cup of coffee and cakes or doughnuts, such as that being the most affordable meal available in a diner or café, and commonly considered to be 'the office diet'. As an adjective, the term \\"coffee-and\\" was used in the 1930s relating to money, as in \\"just enough to buy coffee and doughnuts\\", and in the 20th century as a term referring to things that are \\"cheap, minimal\\" or \\"second rate\\". The 20th century English language slang term \\"coffee-and- doughnut gun\\" can refer to a \\"small, relatively powerless gun\\", and was also used in the 1920s as a slang term for \\"a second-rate, unthreatening gangster\\". Police are often described as favoring coffee and doughnuts for their rather inexpensive meals, especially in mornings, owing to the generally low pay they may receive for their work. This is common enough for a trope dealing with \\"cops in doughnut shops\\" to have arisen. Others have speculated that the association police have with coffee and doughnuts arose as officers on night shifts used doughnut shops (one of the few businesses open all night in the 1940s) to write up notes, use the bathroom, and have a snack.

It used rotating antennae and a PPI (Plan Position Indicator) display to allow its use for ground mapping. Although only a handful of sets were constructed, they saw service on the Fw 200 Condor.  Description  = Influence of the British cavity magnetron = FuG 224 Berlin A, and the contemporary FuG 240 Berlin N1 or Nachtjagd air interception radar, both made use of captured examples of the British cavity magnetron in the H2S radar. A H2S-equipped Short Stirling bomber had crashed near Rotterdam on the night of 2 February 1943. This led to H2S being given the German codename Rotterdam Gerät. Telefunken were instructed to examine the wreckage and build six replicas of it. This study also led to the development of the Naxos radar detector against it. Telefunken studied the design of the cavity magnetron and found it superior to the German split-anode magnetrons, particularly for its high power, high frequency performance. Magnetrons based on this captured 9 cm wavelength design, the British CV64, were produced, the German LMS10 operating with a power of 10 kW. Radar using them followed, but not quickly, the FuG 224 not appearing until early 1944. Few sets were built, around 50. One difference with the German magnetron was the source of the magnetic field. British magnetrons used high quality permanent magnets. These were so difficult to obtain in Germany that they were recovered from crashed Allied aircraft. The main German magnetron used an electromagnet instead. = Antenna = The antenna of the FuG 224 was unusual, a four element Dielektrische Strahler or polyrod (British) array. Capture of the magnetron had allowed the development of the Naxos radar detector as a countermeasure to it. This had been the first equipment to use a polyrod antenna. Each rod is a tapering end-fed rod made of a polystyrene dielectric. The four array elements were 3 λ long (27 cm) apiece, and spaced 1.5 λ (13.5 cm) apart. Using this array, rather than a parabolic dish, gave an extremely compact antenna, with only a shallow protrusion, which was well- suited for aircraft carriage, particularly when needed to rotate. The array could rotate at the high speed of 400 rpm, fast enough that the PPI display did not require the usual long persistence phosphor. = Display deflection = Magnetic deflection was used to produce the PPI display. The first design used two fixed sets of deflection yokes, at right angles to each other, and varying the drive signal to both of them by means of a goniometer. Later designs used the more conventional approach, where a single deflection yoke was physically rotated, in synchronism with the antenna's rotation. The rotating deflection yoke was an advantage for naval use, where multiple displays were provided for the same radar set. By using the established technology of synchros and resolvers, stable slaved displays could be provided.  Naval developments  = FuMO 81 = FuMO 81 was a development of Berlin A for large surface warships. It was installed on the Tirpitz and Prinz Eugen. = FuMO 83 = FuMO 83 Berlin I U1 = FuMO 84 = FuMO 84 Berlin II was a naval development of the FuG 224, intended for the type XXI U-boats.

It is one of three memorials to British military leaders of World War II on Raleigh Green, outside the Ministry of Defence's Main Building, the others being Oscar Nemon's 1980 statue of Lord Montgomery and Roberts-Jones's statue of Lord Alanbrooke, erected later in 1993. Slim's bronze statue stands approximately high on a pedestal of Portland stone. History The campaign to erect a memorial to Slim was launched by the Burma Star Association in early 1988, when eight sculptors were invited to submit designs for a statue. Of these, five agreed to compete: Roberts-Jones, James Butler, David Norris, Christopher Marvell and Michael Rizzello. An appeal for subscriptions was launched in The Independent newspaper on 28 June, by which time planning permission had been obtained for a site near the statue of Montgomery on Whitehall. The competition's assessors requested that the artists respect the wishes of the second Viscount Slim to depict his father \\"as all the troops who served under his command in Burma will remember him ... in Bush hat and jungle dress\\". Roberts-Jones's winning competition entry was singled out for praise by Slim's widow, who thought that the sculptor had got \\"Bill's stance and jawline just right\\", and by his son. The artist had himself fought under Slim in the Burma Campaign of World War II and was a member (albeit an inactive one) of the Suffolk branch of the BSA. Roberts-Jones regarded the field marshal as \\"the one genuine hero I have ever personally laid eyes on\\"; his encounter with Slim had occurred \\"in a paddy field on the road to Mandalay (in March 1945)\\". He would periodically re-read Slim's memoirs Defeat into Victory and Unofficial History, and apparently based the statue's pose on a photograph of Slim reproduced in his own copy of the former book. The statue was unveiled by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 April 1993; the Queen was reported as having remarked on the day that it was \\"not before time\\" for such a tribute. The sculpture was of particular personal significance to Roberts-Jones; his assistant Brian Jarvis observed that the work was a \\"labour of love\\" for the elder artist, and Roberts-Jones was satisfied at the prospect of having Slim's statue \\"to be remembered by\\". The maquette for the statue is in the collection of the Henry Moore Institute in Leeds. Inscriptions The statue in its setting on Raleigh Green, with the Ministry of Defence Main Building behind.

Developed over a period of about 40 years beginning c. 1906, the complex, with two surviving buildings, it represents one of Vermont's largest commercial enterprises of the period. The property, located on the eastern side of Bellows Falls Island, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The former Bellows Falls Creamery is located on the eastern part of the island formed by the Connecticut River and Bellows Falls Canal. It is located just south of the rail yard on the northern part of the island, and north of the Adams Gristmill Warehouse. It consists of one large multi-component building, three stories at its tallest, and an adjacent heating plant. The main building has openings to the rail yard to the north, and a drive accesses the complex from Bridge Street to the south at a higher elevation. Its main sections, three stories in height, are built of concrete with brick and other exterior finishes. Added sections give the building a U shape, with the opening to the south. Immediately southeast of the southeastern leg of the U stands the two- story brick heating plant. left The first creamery established in Bellows Falls was a two-story wood frame structure built by the Boston Dairy Company about 1906. The main building of the surviving creamery complex was built about 1918 by the Liberty Paper Company, and both buildings were acquired by the Bellows Falls Co-operative Creamery in 1921. This business, which processed milk from more than 200 member farmers, shipped milk products to market in Boston, Massachusetts by rail. In 1932 the plant was expanded, replacing the 1906 building with a larger modern structure, now part of the main building. The company remained successful, growing its plant over the following decades. In 1964, however, it lost its contract with Finast, a major regional grocery chain, and ceased operations in 1965. The buildings were used as storage and stood vacant for many years thereafter, suffering from neglect, vandalism, and fires that destroyed one wing and part of the main building. Despite that, the buildings represent a major reminder of an important element of Vermont's economy in the early 20th century.

In total, the series received three Emmy Awards, five Emmy nominations, and five Telly Awards. The series examines how small towns like Canton and Massillon, Ohio were the blueprint for fielding early pro football teams as well as fostering healthy rivalries. As precursors to the current day NFL, teams like the Akron Pros, Dayton Triangles, Columbus Panhandles, Portsmouth Spartans, Ironton Tanks, Shelby Blues, Oorang Indians, Rochester Jeffersons, Buffalo All-Americans, Milwaukee Badgers, and Green Bay Packers laid the groundwork for the successes of today's big city NFL teams. The series focuses mainly on the Ohio League, the NFL's most immediate predecessor, while also making note of other regional teams and circuits such as the western Pennsylvania conference and New York Pro Football League. Actors and historians The documentary film is narrated by Chuck Campbell.

Ali Çelebi was born in Isparta, Anatolia in the Islamic year of 916, corresponding to 1510 or 1511, member of a notable family. He was the son of Kadı (judge) Emrullah Mehmed (d.1559) and the grandson of Abd' al- Kadir Hamidi. As his father, he became a judge and served in several locations within the Empire: Damascus, Bursa, Cairo, and Edirne. In October of November 1570 he settled in Constantinople. Ali was appointed Kadi'asker for Anatolia in early summer 1571. He died on January 22 or 23, 1572, during the Holy Ramadan month. Ali left two sons, both noted poets of the time. Mehmet Fehmı Efendi (d. May 1596), known as Fehmî, and Hasan, known as Kınalızâde Hasan Çelebi. Though both left their name in the Ottoman literature, according to the historian Mustafa Âlî who knew the family members, none of them rose at the level of their father. Beside being a judge, Ali was a very industrious writer, producing a number of glossaries and commentaries on Islamic theological works. His notable work was Akhlak-ı Ala'i written in 1564 and dedicated to the beylerbey of Syria, Ali Pasha. It is a high end study on ethics. The original manuscript is conserved in the \\"Rhagib Pasha Library\\" in Istanbul. It was printed in February 1833 in Bulaq, published in 1974, and was first translated by the Venetian Giovanni Medun. Another valuable work is his collection of letters, divided in five sections. It contains stylistic masterpieces of different kinds of literary compositions.

The French language is used on Lebanese pound bank notes, road signs, vehicle registration plates, and on public buildings, alongside Arabic. The majority of Lebanese people speak Lebanese Arabic, which is grouped in a larger category called Levantine Arabic, while Modern Standard Arabic is mostly used in magazines, newspapers, and formal broadcast media. Code-switching between Arabic and French is very common.

Blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a rare disease characterized by the conditions it is named after: blepharophimosis, ptosis and epicanthus inversus. There are two types; type 1 is distinguished from type 2 by including the symptom of premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) in females, which causes menopausal symptoms and infertility in patients as young as 15 years old.  Signs and symptoms  The most prominent symptoms of BPES are horizontally narrow eyes (blepharophimosis), drooping eyelids (ptosis) and a fold of skin running from the side of the nose to the lower eyelid (epicanthus inversus). Other common symptoms include lack of an eyelid fold, an appearance of widely spaced eyes (telecanthus), low nose bridge and ear malformations (including cupping and incomplete development). Rare symptoms include microphthalmos (abnormally small eyes), tear ducts in the wrong location and a high-arched palate. Type 1 BPES is distinguished by including premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) in females, which causes menopausal symptoms and infertility in patients as young as 15 years old.  Genetics  BPES is caused by a mutation in the gene FOXL2, located at 3q23 (band 23 on the long arm of chromosome 3). There are two types, caused by different mutations in this gene, but both follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.  Diagnosis  Though BPES can be suggested by the presence of blepharophimosis, ptosis and/or epicanthus inversus, it can only be definitively diagnosed by genetic testing. Other disorders that appear similar include Waardenburg syndrome and Ohdo blepharophimosis syndrome.  Treatment  The main treatment is symptomatic, since the underlying genetic defect cannot be corrected as of 2015. Symptomatic treatment is surgical.  Epidemiology  BPES is very rare: only 50–100 cases have been described. It affects slightly more males than females.

Born in St Leonards, New South Wales on 20 July 1896, Orr played junior cricket in Australia before enlisting in the Australian 9th Flying Corps Engineers in 1916. Following the war, he worked for Sydney solicitors Minter Simpson & Co. until 1922 when he accepted a role with the New Zealand Farmers' Co-operative Distributing Company in Wanganui, New Zealand. An opening batsman, Orr quickly gained local attention for his cricketing skill, being lauded for his \\"solid defence and an exquisite square cut\\",Whitehorn, p. 20. and after some high scores was selected for Wanganui for the Hawke Cup match against Rangitikei on 15 November 1922, making 72. He was soon selected in a Minor Associations side to play the touring MCC side, scoring one and eleven. Despite the poor returns against the MCC, Orr was chosen for the Minor Associations side in a match against Wellington which served as a trial for Wellington's upcoming Plunket Shield match against Auckland. He made 27 and 44; enough to be included in the Wellington team for his first-class debut. Orr made his debut on Christmas Day 1923 against Auckland at the Wellington College Ground, making 69 and 35 as Wellington won by 365 runs. Orr's performance was rated highly by the media, with one newspaper reporter stating \\"He is a finished batsman, with a wide range of good scoring strokes. He gave the impression that he could score fast if he were to take the brake off but in each innings ... he played for the side rather than himself.\\"Whitehorn, pp. 20–21. Orr was retained for Wellington's next match, against Canterbury at Basin Reserve, scoring nine and zero. At the time Wellington's sole selector Kinder Tucker did not travel outside Wellington to watch regional matches and was notoriously reluctant to select country players, so players were selected on their performances in Wellington. As a result, Orr continued to score heavily for Wanganui, including 124 against Auckland in January 1924 but failures in matches played in front of Tucker meant Orr did not return to first-class cricket until Wellington's 7 January 1927 match against Auckland. Orr scored 68 in the first innings and was run out for six in the second but was never again selected for Wellington. He continued to play for Wanganui, including a match against the touring 1927/1928 Australian team, where he top scored with 24 out of 83 as former Wellington cricketer Clarrie Grimmett took eight wickets for thirty runs (8/30) for the tourists. Orr continued to appear for Wanganui sporadically until his retirement from cricket in 1934, having scored 1412 runs for Wanganui at 27.60. While his first-class career was brief, Orr's career with Wanganui was highly regarded, with cricket author T.W. Reese, in his book New Zealand Cricket, stating that the resurgence of cricket in Wanganui post war could be attributed to Orr who \\"not only proved himself a very sound batsman but seemed by his success to inspire the others.\\" Following his retirement, Orr was a long serving Wanganui delegate to the Wellington Cricket Association and became a respected figure in the Wellington media for his views on cricket. Orr served in the Pacific conflict during World War II as a lieutenant in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force before returning to Wanganui where he served as Chairman of Directors of the Wanganui Traders' Association, Secretary of the Wanganui Grain and Seed Merchants' Association and Chairman of Directors, Amalgamated Grain Distributors Association, Wellington.Whitehorn, p. 21.

Both groups aim to reform the Thai education system. Netiwit is one of the outspoken activists who against Thai Junta both on his Facebook and in the public. In 2018, the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) filed a police complaint against him and six activists for being leaders of the protest and accused them, along with thirty-two other protesters, of violating the 2015 Public Assembly Act., which might cost him 7 – 9 years in jail. In 2018, Netiwit was announced as 1 of 50 Asians to watch in public and social sector by the Straits Times as an honor to his social works, especially on democracy, education and military conscription. Netiwit was also the elected student council president at Chulalongkorn University\\"Netiwit's monument gesture fires up internet\\" (Bangkok Post, 20 July 2016). But he was striped off the position and reduced the behavioural points by university authorities after 2017 Chulalongkorn University incident, even the supports of him by Eight nobel laureates and the academics such as Noam Chomsky, Steven Pinker and many others. However, after he filed a petition with the Court against Chulalongkorn University, then a year later, the administrative court ruled in his favor and his position and behavioural points was returned. Netiwit is currently studying at Chulalongkorn University, majoring in political science. and a librarian at the Santi Pracha Dhamma Library. In April, 2020, he was voted by students of Faculty of Political Science, Chulalongkorn University to be a President of Political Science Student Union of Chulalongkorn University for 2020 - 2021.  Early life  Netiwit Chotiphatphaisal was born 10 September 1996 in Bangkok, Thailand. He is the second child of a middle-class family of shopkeepers, growing up in Samut Prakan Province.  TERA  In 2012, Netiwit and a group of fellow students formed TERA (Thailand Education Revolution Alliance). A student-led organization, TERA aimed to pressure education authorities to reform the Thai education system. This includes abolishing of the strict uniform codes, increasing the quality of teachers and the curriculum, reducing rote-style education, and increasing the number of public schools. Netiwit gained public recognition after appearing on a television program to speak about the organization and its cause.  Education for Liberation of Siam  Education for Liberation of Siam was formed in December 2013 by Netiwit and other student activists. Netiwit serves as the first secretary of the organization. The purpose of the group is to provide a platform for student activism and disseminating questionable actions and misconduct by authority figures in the Thai education system. In 2014, under the secretary general Nattanan Warintarawet, the organization gained prominence for protesting against educational reforms put in place by the Junta.  Activism at Chulalongkorn University  In July 2016, Netiwit and a friend caused controversy by refusing to prostrate before the statue of King Rama V at an annual Chulalongkorn University event citing that King Rama V himself abolished the act. He received both praise and criticism from the act, notably the ire of General Prayut Chan-o-cha, leader of Thailand's junta. Netiwit has also spoken out against hazing in a common Thai initiation tradition known as \\"rub nong\\" (; ; ). In 2016, Netiwit personally invited activist Joshua Wong to speak at an event commemorating the 1976 Thammasat University massacre. Wong was detained for twelve hours upon entering Thailand but managed to speak to attendees via Skype after being deported. In May 2017, Netiwit was elected as Student Council President at Chulalongkorn University.  Removal from student council  Netiwit and seven other members of the student council walked out of an oath-giving ceremony requiring them to prostrate in front of a statue of King Rama VI in symbolic protest. As a result, one of the members was assaulted by a professor, Reungwit Bunjongrat, and the protesting members had their \\"behavioural scores\\" cut by the university as punishment. Subsequently, this led to the members, including Netiwit, being removed from their position on the student council. Netiwit has since received support from academics and activists internationally, including the Nobel Prize laureate Roald Hoffmann, the scholar and political activist Noam Chomsky, and the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker. In January 2018, seven Nobel laureates sent a petition to Chulalongkorn University to appeal for Netiwit and his seven friends and to criticize the university. In 2019 after he filed a petition with the Court against Chulalongkorn University, the administrative court ruled in his favor since then Chulalongkorn university authority returned his position and behavioural points to him.  Political case  = 2018 sedition charges = On 25 January 2018, Netiwit joined as an observer in an anti-junta protest organized by the Democracy Restoration Group (DRG) in the subway close to the MBK Center. On 29 January, the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) filed a police complaint against him and six activists for being leaders of the protest and accused them, along with thirty-two other protesters, of violating the 2015 Public Assembly Act. On 8 February, the court released him unconditionally, along with the other thirty- two activists. However, the police sent the appeal to the court, so the case is still not being ruled. = RDN50 = On 10 February 2018, Netiwit joined as an observer in an anti-junta protest \\"Stop power Stop late election time up NCPO. start Democracy\\" in Mac Donald near Democracy Monument. Next week, he has been accused for violating the 2015 Public Assembly Act and disturbing peace in the country. The case is still not ruled by the court. = ARMY57 = On 24 March 2018, Metiwit joined as an activity of Thammasart University and Royal Thai Army. He has been one of the 57 people accusing by the police for violating the 2015 Public Assembly Act and disturbing peace in the country. The case is still not ruled by the court.  UN 62  On 22 May 2018, Netiwit joined as a protester calling the Junta to give the general election to Thai people, and resign from the government. In that day, the protesters went to protest in front of the United Nation headquarter in Bangkok. Netiwit did not go there. However, next week he had been accused by the police for violating the 2015 Public Assembly Act and disturbing peace in the country. The case is still not ruled by the court. In May 2018, the Humboldt University student council stated the public statement on the official website calling on university leaders and student representatives in Germany to stand with him and asking the Thai government to drop all charges against him and others immediately.  Blocked by Police to be Board Member of Amnesty International Thailand  In 2018, he ran to be board members of Amnesty International Thailand, AIT, and to be elected in the Annual General Meeting 2019 on 21 July 2018. Then, AIT filed a request to the Bangkok Association Registrar to have a replacement of board member. However, the Bangkok Association Registrar informed AIT that they could not register and issue a permit for the registration of all new board members invoking Netiwit's improper demeanor or lack of qualification to be a member of an Association's Board. An appeal was filed as a result of which the authority accepted to register the three new board members save for Netiwit. AIT later filed an appeal with the Minister of Interior furhishing and was further informed that Netiwit was being held criminally liable in four cases for “being complicit in an act to defy the Head of the National Council for Peace and Order no. 3/2558 on “The Maintenance of Public Order and National Security's Article 12”. The authority therefore deemed the demeanor of him was not fit for the administration of a good association that serves public interest and to set an example for general public and youth. It was deemed his behavior was improper and he was therefore not qualified to sit as a board member of the association since it may affect public order and national security. The alleged police document leaked to Netiwit in 2020 outlines four points regarding his ‘unsuitable behavior’ from when he was in high school to his time at Chulalongkorn University. The four points are: *insuitable behavior that breaches Thai etiquette and culture (citing his demand to abolish school hair-cut rules when he was in high school) *Non-cooperation with military conscription in accordance with the law *Leading and/or participating in a protest that would harm Thai diplomatic relations (citing his demonstration in support of Liu Xiaobo and 1989 Tiananmen Square protests) *Actions against provisions and litigation In October 2019, AIT and Netiwit filed a lawsuit with the Administrative Court, the defendants are the registrar for alleged abuse of power in disqualifying Netiwit and Interior Minister Gen Anupong Paochinda for neglect of duty for failing to deliver the appeal result in the stipulated timeframe. Recognition * In 2013, Netiwit had been nominated for a National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) award, but he rejected it, stating that he doubts whether the NHRC really takes the human rights issues seriously. *In 2018 Netiwit was invited as one of the speakers at Oslo Freedom Forum 2018, which sponsored by the Human Rights Foundation. *In 2018, Netiwit was announced as 1 of 50 Asians to watch in the public and social sector by the Straits Times (Singapore Press) as an honor to his social works, especially on democracy, education and military conscription. Publishing After he was stripped of the position of the president of the student council, Netiwit and his colleagues founded Sam Nak Nisit Sam Yan Publishing (SCPH), non-profit publisher, with the aim of publishing students’ books and Thai translations of foreign political and philosophical works concerning with human rights and democratic ideas. In the statement on SCPH website, it emphasizes to bridge knowledge from the ‘east’ and ‘west’ together in order to promote a secure foundation for upholding human rights both in and out of Thailand as well as the mean to strengthen communication between professors, students and the general public. The first work published by SCPH was the book published during Joshua Wong was in jail due to his conviction overturned by the Hong Kong court in October 2017. The book, Time is on our side: A birthday book for Joshua Wong’, which translated by Netiwit himself, contained translated essays from Martin Luther King Jr. ( Letter from Birmingham Jail) and Liu Xiaobo (Tiananmen Square: The hunger strike declaration, 2 June 1989), as well as a translated interview with Joshua Wong. After that SCPH has published the work of philosopher such as Isaiah Berlin, Liu Xiaobo, Cass Sunstein, Timothy Snyder, Vaclav Havel, Rebecca Solnit as well as many activism work. Joshua Wong, a prominent activist, said about the publishing as ‘Sam Nak Nisit Samyang Publishing offers to youngsters of Thai a lesson on how to confront authoritarian oppression under a hard-line policy of the regime’ Writing and Translating Netiwit has written many books on the Thai education he experienced in general and his school in particular; His well-known book is ‘A Bad Student In an Excellent Educational System’ concerning his struggle in high school. He also wrote the opinion on Thai politics, and on Chinese abusing human rights of Uighurs, Hong Kong and Tibetans.

He was the first New York-born champion since the Marquess of Queensberry rules were adopted. The professional career of Spider Kelly as a boxer began in 1887 when he knocked out Larry Boylan, with Boylan being removed from the ring unconscious. Continuing to win his fights, at the end of 1887, Kelly claimed the title of American bantam-weight champion, having defeated Tommy Russell. In early 1888, Kelly fought a draw against George Dixon and then obtained his first victory over Michael Chappie Moran, who would later become his greatest career rival. In a second match with Moran, in an 1889 fight that was billed as a world title bantam-weight fight, Kelly was victorious, allowing him to claim the world bantam-weight title. However, only a few months later, in his third duel against Moran, Kelly was defeated and the world title went to Moran. Nevertheless, in early 1890, Kelly and Moran fought a fourth time. Kelly managed to serve a definitive knockout to his rival during this match, as Kelly laid Moran out on the canvas within a time of 38 minutes. Kelly held on to his world bantam-weight title until 1892, when he was dethroned by Englishman Billy Plimmer in 10 rounds at Coney Island. After losing his title to Plimmer, Kelly fought - through a hard series of defeats - Tim Murphy (3 times), Maxie Haugh, Kid Gleason, Frank Brierley, Harry Fisher, Casper Leon, and Fred Mayo. Finally, after a discouraging nine years of on and off fighting with just three wins to eight losses, Kelly decided to retire in 1901 after four consecutive draws against the light-weight fighter, Kid Goodman.

Roger Thatcher, was a British statistician. Thatcher was born in Birmingham and spent his formative early years in Wilmslow, Cheshire. He attended The Leys School in Cambridge and went on to university at St John's College, Cambridge, where he concentrated his studies in statistics, economics, and mathematics. After brief training in meteorology as part of his national service, he instructed Royal Navy pilots in weather patterns. He married his wife Mary in 1950; they had two children. He served in the North Western Gas Board before moving into the area of government statistics in 1952. He worked for the Admiralty and then Central Statistics Office, where under Lionel Robbins he worked on the Robbins Report. By 1971 he was deputy director of statistics for the Ministry of Labour, and wrote British Labour Statistics: Historical Abstract 1886–1968. He became director of the Department of Employment and Productivity, serving under leaders including William Whitelaw, 1st Viscount Whitelaw, Barbara Castle, Baroness Castle of Blackburn, and Michael Foot. He became registrar general for England and Wales and the director of the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys in 1978. He worked on the 1981 census in the United Kingdom and reported directly to Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Margaret Thatcher, who had him remove three questions from the census to trim it down. He became interested in research into centenarians in this role, and found in 1981 that their numbers in the United Kingdom had increased significantly from prior 1971 data. He served as director at the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys until 1986. Thatcher compiled research into population data and centenarians and contributed a significant body of scholarly work in addition to his government statistics duties. He predicted a good number of those born during the post–World War II baby boom would live beyond the age of 116. His work on the Kannisto-Thatcher Database on Old Age Mortality is held by the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research and regarded as one of its most vital collections. The Journal of the Royal Statistical Society called him one of the \\"stalwarts\\" within the field of statistics. He died in 2010 at the age of 83, and remained active within his field of academia corresponding with other scholars until shortly before his death. Early life and family He was born as Arthur Roger Thatcher on 22 October 1926 in Birmingham to Arthur Thatcher and Edith (née Dobson). Thatcher spent his formative years in Wilmslow, Cheshire. He attended The Leys School in Cambridge for his secondary education. He went on to attend St John's College, Cambridge, and while there focused his academic concentration on the three areas of statistics, economics, and mathematics. By his third-year of studies at the college in 1946, he had attained high honours. He was mobilised as part of national service, instructed briefly in meteorology, and went to assist pilots in the Royal Navy with weather analysis. In 1950 he married his wife Mary; they subsequently had two children: Susan and Jill. Statistics career =Government service= Subsequent to his departure from national service, Thatcher was hired by the North Western Gas Board. He transferred from this agency to government statistics in 1952, and was first employed by the Admiralty and then afterwards by the Central Statistics Office two years later. He worked on the Robbins Report under Lionel Robbins while in this office, compiling information about higher education. Thatcher served as deputy director of statistics for the Ministry of Labour, where in 1971 he put together the original version of the publication, British Labour Statistics: Historical Abstract 1886–1968. Under the newly formed version of the same agency in 1968, subsequently titled the Department of Employment and Productivity, Thatcher served as director. In this role he worked under agency leaders including William Whitelaw, 1st Viscount Whitelaw, Barbara Castle, Baroness Castle of Blackburn, and Michael Foot. In 1978, Thatcher became registrar general for England and Wales and the director of the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys. His work on the 1981 census in the United Kingdom in this role proved to be a difficult task, primarily due to the sheer size of total effort required for the operation. Thatcher was required to delete three queries from the census after personally meeting to discuss the matter with then-Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Margaret Thatcher. In 1981, Thatcher found that over the prior thirty-year-period, the number of individuals alive to reach the age of 100 had increased by a figure of sixfold. At a 1981 meeting in Sussex held by the Medical Journalists Association, Thatcher presented the findings from his research and called the results \\"spectacular\\". He reported that in 1971 there were less than 300 people in the United Kingdom over 100 years of age, and that this number had risen to 1800 total people of the same age range by 1981. Thatcher served as director of the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys until 1986. =Population research= He subsequently was drawn into researching discrepancies between the 1981 census and a prior version completed in 1971, specifically on data involving centenarians. During the course of this research, he found that there was a lack of study regarding the well-being of centenarians in the United Kingdom. Thatcher posited that the increase in longevity amongst those individuals that actually get to one-hundred was likely attributable to lack of stress in these older years. Thatcher found that contributing factors towards this progress in longevity also included better overall healthcare and an ever-increasing total population size in general. According to his research, Thatcher predicted that in the decade of the 2080s, each year the United Kingdom would see one individual reach the age of 116. He asserted that a fair number of individuals born between the 1950s–1960s attributed to the post–World War II baby boom would see a life expectancy age range between 116–123 total years. In addition to his roles within government Thatcher contributed to the field of statistics through writings collaborated upon with other academics. His 1983 article \\"How Many People Have Ever Lived On Earth?\\", a publication of the International Statistical Institute, disproved the notion that the number of people living in the 20th century was in actuality much less than the total number of individuals previously in existence. His work on the Kannisto-Thatcher Database on Old Age Mortality is held by the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research and regarded as one of its most vital collections. The database contains information from over 30 sovereign states on mortality and population size for males and females older than the age of 80. Their research was entered into computer format by the medical school at Odense University in the early part of the 1990s. Academic scholars James Vaupel and Väinö Kannisto helped him co-author the book The Force of Mortality at Ages 80 to 120, which was first published in 1998. Writing in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society in 2000, Douglas Liddell placed Thatcher amongst \\"stalwarts\\" within the field of statistics, and compared him to others influential within the field including fellow statistician Michael Healy. Death Thatcher remained active within the field of statistics throughout his old age, communicating with academics in Asia, the United States, and Europe. Until the day he died, he was enthusiastically involved in research within the field of demographics. He died at the age of 83 on 13 February 2010. He was outlived by his wife and two children.

That same year, Anderson Sr. founded the Howard Anderson Special Photographic Effects Company, where Anderson Jr. began working part-time in the 1930s, when he was still in his pre-teens. By age 10, Anderson had become what he later called a \\"Navy enthusiast,\\" and he joined the U.S. Navy Reserve while in high school. He began attending Alexander Hamilton High School in 1934 and transferred to Hollywood High School the following year, graduating in 1938. He then enrolled in UCLA, where he studied mathematics and took part in the university's Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps program. He left UCLA after two years to get married; his first child, Howard A. Anderson III, was born in 1947, and a daughter followed in 1948I was a classmate in high school. He found work shooting industrial films for the Douglas Aircraft Company, including documenting the construction of the Douglas XB-19 and the company's public relations film We Give Them Wings. In 1943, Anderson began serving in the U.S. Navy, primarily as a still photographer and as a cameraman on training films.  Career  = Television = After returning from naval service in 1946, Anderson began working at his father's company alongside his father and brother. Some of the early shows he worked on were The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show, Dragnet, The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet, and Hopalong Cassidy. In 1954, the Anderson brothers took over the company from their father. During the 1950s and '60s, Anderson helped create title sequences and other visual elements for many of the programs made by Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball's Desilu Productions, including I Love Lucy, The Lucy Show, The Untouchables, Mission: Impossible, and Star Trek. Anderson designed the \\"heart on satin\\" titles for the daytime rebroadcasts of I Love Lucy that have since become opening familiar to most viewers. On Star Trek; in addition to creating the show's title sequence, he and his brother were one of four visual effects teams on the series. They began working with Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry in 1964 to develop effects for the show's first pilot, \\"The Cage\\", and continued working on the series throughout its three seasons. Among the visuals which the brothers created for Star Trek were the star fields through which the USS Enterprise cruised, the photographic method for the illusion of people being transported or \\"beamed\\" to and from the ship, and matte paintings and other effects for the various alien worlds seen throughout the show. Anderson helped create the title sequences for The Brady Bunch, which featured the show's nine cast members in a tic-tac-toe board—a sequence which Anderson himself shot. He also helped create the title sequences for The Addams Family, The Andy Griffith Show, The Beverly Hillbillies, Daniel Boone, The Dick Van Dyke Show, The Fugitive, Get Smart, I Spy, The Invaders, The Mod Squad, My Favorite Martian, My Three Sons, The Outer Limits, That Girl, The Twilight Zone, and many other shows. During the 1970s, he was behind the opening titles of shows such as Happy Days, including the shot of the jukebox record and providing the neon sign displaying the show's title, and Kung Fu, of which he was particularly proud, calling it his \\"claim to fame.\\" He also worked on the titles for Barnaby Jones, Charlie's Angels, Dallas, Little House on the Prairie, Love American Style, The Love Boat, The Waltons, and Wonder Woman, among many others. Title sequences he created during the 1980s include those for The A-Team, Cheers, and Dynasty. = Film = Anderson created main titles and visual effects for over 100 films throughout his career, with some of his earliest being Prehistoric Women and Phantom from Space. He collaborated with fellow special effects artist Milt Rice on the science fiction thriller Invasion of the Body Snatchers and on several Billy Wilder comedies, including Some Like It Hot and The Apartment, with Anderson creating the titles for the latter two films. Anderson also shot the inserts for the Americanized version of Godzilla Raids Again, which was released in 1959 as Gigantis the Fire Monster. He also did effects work on such films as George Pal's The Time Machine, J. Lee Thompson's Taras Bulba, and Nathan H. Juran's Jack the Giant Killer. The highlight of Anderson's film work was Arthur Hiller's war film Tobruk, for which Anderson and Albert Whitlock were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects at the 40th Academy Awards. He later did uncredited work on such films as Escape from the Planet of the Apes, Blazing Saddles, Gray Lady Down, Heaven Can Wait, Superman, and Annie.  Retirement and death  Anderson retired from active effects work in 1990, though he continued to run the Howard Anderson Company until 1994. In 2004, Anderson received the President's Award for lifetime achievement from the American Society of Cinematographers, of which he had been a member since 1962. In 2007, he received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, the organization behind the Emmy Awards. Anderson died in California on September 27, 2015. He was 95.

Koch. It was published in the United States by Crown Business, an imprint of the Crown Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House LLC. It was published in the United Kingdom by Piatkus. It is a follow-up to a 2007 book by Koch called The Science of Success. Book summary In the book, Koch explains the business strategy behind the remarkable success of his family-owned firm, Koch Industries, which is the second largest privately owned company in the United States. Koch is the firm's co-owner, CEO, and chairman of the board. This strategy, or “management framework,” is called “Market-Based Management,” or “MBM.” Koch says that his book is meant for all business readers who desire to move beyond “anecdotes, buzzwords, and laundry lists” to apply MBM methods to generate profit for themselves, their business, and to improve society as a whole. In explaining MBM, Koch writes that it involves analyzing “business through a win-win mind-set.” This strategy, he maintains, has enabled the firm to deal with dramatic geopolitical, economic, and technological changes, and at the same time to earn what he describes as “good profits.” By this, he means profits that result from treating customers with respect and placing their values first. By contrast, “bad profit” involves “disrespecting customers by making them subsidize our business with their tax dollars and higher prices, siphoning away the good profit other companies could have earned.” The book argues, then, for a free market, liberated from the distortions of corporate welfare. Koch calls for the elimination of government “distortions,” such as ethanol mandates and import tariffs. Although Koch Industries profits “short term from these market distortions,” states Koch, they “don't lead to good profit” and thus “leave virtually everyone worse off long term, including us.” Koch explains that he has willingly shared MBM principles with other firms and organizations, since he is confident that the success of others will not diminish his own. “On the contrary, MBM is win-win” Koch has stated, revealing his view that there are no zero-sum scenarios. Dimensions of Market-Based Management =Vision= Koch underscores that in order to achieve long-term success a business cannot rely on short-term profits but must accept the necessity of what economist Joseph Schumpeter calls “creative destruction.” This means that a firm must innovate at least as quickly as its most effective competitor. Koch also cites Adam Smith's maxim that “Consumption is the sole end and purpose of production; and the interests of the producer ought to be attended to only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer.” Building on these insights, Koch explains that at the heart of MBM is the understanding that the role of business “is to help people improve their lives by providing products and services they value more highly than their alternatives, and to do so while consuming fewer resources.” =Virtue and Talents= Koch explains that the most important attribute his firm looks for in potential employees is “good character and compatible values.” The company has a list of ten “Guiding Principles,” which include integrity, compliance, value creation, humility, and respect. Koch elaborates at length on each of the characteristics he seeks out in job applicants, and outlines the process by which his firm seeks to develop good hires into optimal employees. He offers many observations that might surprise some readers, noting, for example, that while some firms favor Ivy League graduates, “Koch has enjoyed much better results hiring from Wichita State or Kansas State than from Harvard.” =Knowledge Processes= Koch discusses what he calls “disruptive innovation,” which involves “creating, acquiring, sharing, and applying knowledge.” It is important, he underlines, for a business to be informed immediately about developments occurring all around the world, and to adjust its operations accordingly. He reflects on the advantages and disadvantages of hiring consultants, discusses how to convert information into results, and expands on the insight that “Knowing why something is profitable is often as valuable as knowing what is profitable.” He also discusses such procedures as “benchmarking,” which involves “identifying, understanding, and adopting superior practices from anywhere in the world.” =Decision Rights= The fourth dimension of MBM is “decision rights,” which, Koch explains, “should reflect an employee's demonstrated comparative advantages.” For example, a top salesperson's time should be devoted time to making sales, while analysis of those sales should be left to a technically qualified sales analyst. Such a division of labor, explains Koch, leads to greater value creation. The bestowal of decision rights upon an individual, moreover, should not be predicated upon that individual's position in the corporate hierarchy. Some decisions, Koch further observes, need to be centralized, while a change in circumstances can make it necessary to transfer decision rights from one person, department, or level to another. Koch also outlines his firm's “Decision Making Framework,” an eight-step procedure that stresses the importance of using “no more steps or complexity than is necessary to make a sound decision.” =Incentives= “MBM,” writes Koch, “eschews limits on what employees can earn.” Providing incentives is important, although he distinguishes between “beneficial incentives and perverse incentives.” The former are incentives that “reward creating the most value in society,” while the latter “motivate employees to do the wrong things.” Beneficial incentives are characteristic of prosperous societies; perverse incentives are found in societies, including Communist societies that suffer from poverty, waste, and corruption. =Case studies and conclusion= Toward the end of his book, Koch recounts four case studies in MBM from the corporate history of Koch Industries, specifying the ways in which the five dimensions of MBM came into play in each instance. In his conclusion, he stresses the importance of grasping MBM as a “holistic” strategy and lists several mistakes to avoid when implementing MBM. Critical responses In his review of Good Profit for the Financial Times, Ed Crooks described it as “invaluable as a window on the thinking of a hugely important US figure who is uneasy in the public eye.” Reviewing the book in the Wall Street Journal, Joseph Maciariello, professor emeritus of social science and management at Claremont Graduate University, wrote: “C. William Pollard, chief executive emeritus of ServiceMaster, has posed the question: 'Can the business firm make money, create wealth, and also be a moral community for the development of human character and social concern?' In Good Profit, Mr. Koch not only makes a strong argument in the affirmative but also provides a systematic framework—aimed at honing the vision and talent of executives and employees—for how it can be done.” F.H. Buckley, writing in the American Spectator, suggested that Good Profit was “written for two different kinds of readers”: ambitious entrepreneurs and those who are curious “to know how a company that forswears crony capitalism can thrive, as Koch Industries did.” Koch, explained Buckley, believes in “a system of government and of laws that permits people to flourish – a system that clearly defines and protects property rights, that enforces bargains, and that allows people to speak freely.” Noting that this view has put Koch “at odds with the progressive Left,” Buckley concluded: “We’ve had countless novels and plays about how wealth is built on crime, about the evils of capitalism, from people like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Arthur Miller, people who had not the faintest idea about success in business or in life. How refreshing it is to get the real story!” In his review of Good Profit for National Review, William Bennett, noting the left's attacks on the Koch brothers, argued that Charles Koch “should be applauded, not vilified,” for he “aims to revive our belief in entrepreneurship, labor, the joys of work, and the ability of a free people to prosper, innovate, and create value for themselves and others.” Bennett pointed out that “Koch’s philosophy is not to maximize short-term profit, but rather to create and sustain value for his customers over time and to do so in an ethical manner.” Good Profit, stated Bennett, “is as much a course in ethics as one in business management, and Koch is a business icon with the soul and inclination of a philosopher” – an icon, moreover, who offers “the uplifting vision of entrepreneurship and work that America needs right now.” Good Profit has been praised by John Mackey, Co- Founder and Co-CEO of Whole Foods Market, who said that it “helps show you the way to good profit – whether you work for an international supermarket chain, a medium-sized regional business, or your own start-up.” General Richard B. Myers, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called it “The ultimate 'how to' book on running a successful business.... A must read for those who want to take their enterprise to the next level.” John Schnatter, CEO of Papa John's Pizza, called Koch “a genuine patriot” whose “lifelong mission is to make America as strong and free as she can be” and who “believes the principles of economic opportunity that have guided America are worth protecting.” Charles R. Schwab described the book as “a clear example of the American dream and how our country benefits when successful entrepreneurs create new jobs (and more taxes for government services) while providing the golden egg for philanthropic efforts.” References Category:Business books Category:Management books Category:2015 non-fiction books ","title":"Good Profit"},{"id":"48411578","text":"Booubyjan Homestead is a heritage-listed homestead at Booubyjan Road, Booubyjan, Gympie Region, Queensland, Australia. It was built from the 1860s to the 1870s circa. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Booubyjan Homestead is a complex of timber structures built by the Lawless family at varying times in the nineteenth century as their accommodation needs increased. The homestead has, variously, been referred to by a number of variations of the spelling of its title in both personal and business correspondence, Government publications and histories of the area. Such variations include Boombyjan, Boonbyjan, Booubijan and Boombagan. The Lawless' occupation of the Booubyjan run began in 1847, when two brothers Paul and Clement Lawless took up three properties in the Burnett River district. The Lawless brothers arrived in Australia from County Cork, Ireland in 1841. After initially establishing themselves on a farm in the Hunter Valley, the brothers moved to the Moreton Bay district, where they took up the Nindooimba run in 1842. With the intention of finding land more suitable for sheep farming, Paul and Clement Lawless joined an expedition travelling to the Brisbane Valley, where they discovered their future home, Booubyjan, named after a nearby large rock. A letter which Clement Lawless wrote to his sister-in-law, Alicia Lawless-Pyne, dated March 1849, provides many details about the early occupation of the Booubyjan run by the Lawless family. Lawless writes of the effects of the low wool prices and the consequent economic hardships which saw the importation and employment of many \\"Celestials\\" on the station. The wages books from the station attest to the large proportion of Chinese labourers at Booubyjan, who were, it seems, paid considerably less than their European counterparts. The problems with language were overcome because the Chinese did everything by signs most readily and were excellent at tending sheep. This letter goes on to give details of the early ownership of the station: \\"We have not got any Title as yet from the Governor to our Station, which is keeping us in hot water, but expect it during the year. A great deal of business has accumulated in the Lands Office in consequence of a change in Squatting regulations; the whole of the country has to be surveyed before they can give Leases, which must occupy a long time.\\" And by 1850, the New South Wales Government Gazette (June 19) published a list of successful tenders for runs in Crown Lands beyond the settled districts. Paul Lawless is listed with Windera and Clement Lawless with \\"Boombagan\\". According to early Lands Department Registers the Lawless brothers ran a station called Booubyjan and this comprised three runs, namely Booubyjan, Boonimba and Windera. These Registers indicate that Paul was the sole proprietor of Windera and Clement the sole proprietor of Booubyjan run and both brothers oversaw the Boonimba run. An early Register indicates that a lease was issued for the Booubyjan (therein referred to as Boombagan) and Windera Runs in 1862 for a term of 14 years for an annual rent of . However, under Section 55 of the Pastoral Leases Act of 1869, the Lawless' brothers surrendered their leases at both Booubyjan and Windera and were issued with new leases for the two runs in July 1869. Clement Lawless returned to Ireland in about 1860 to marry and remained living in Kilcrone, Ireland until 1869 when he returned to Booubyjan for one year before, again, returning to his country of birth. In 1873 Clement sold his interest in both the Booubyjan station property and another family property, Imbil in the Mary Valley, purchased in 1857, to Ellen Lawless, the wife of his brother Paul. Around 1858, Paul Lawless had also returned to Britain where he married Ellen Nash in Bath, and the young couple set out for Australia in April 1859. Paul and Ellen had three children, and by 1865 it was necessary for the sake of Paul's health to return to Britain where he died shortly after. Ellen, who now held her husband's share in the Australian properties, and her young children spent some years travelling around Europe before returning to Booubyjan in late 1870. After Ellen's death in 1922, the property was bequeathed to her two sons, one of whom, William Burnett Lawless was actually residing at the homestead at the time of his mother's death. William and his wife, Beatrice Muriel Walker, did not have children, and the property was passed on William's death in 1945 to William's nephews, Ivan Desmond Lawless and Burnett Rhys Lawless, who were the sons of John Paul Lawless, then in residence at Windera. Burnett Rhys Lawless continued on at the homestead for many years until his death in 1995, and Booubyjan is now run by Burnett's son, Michael, along with his wife and children. It is not possible to date the buildings and structures on the homestead with any degree of certainty. It seems that the oldest building is that known as the Dining Room, which is thought to have been previously used as a nursery. The Queensland Women's Historical Association placed their first \\"blue plaque\\" in the state on this building in 1960, giving its approximate age as being from 1860. Photographs dating from the 1870s suggest that the two other principal buildings, referred to as the Homestead and the Cottage, were built either during or before the early 1870s. Early photographs of the head station at Booubyjan indicate that the complex has been subject to many changes, where buildings have been removed or added, and in some instances moved slightly. There is evidence, for example, that an elevated timber building to the south west of the Cottage was removed from the complex of buildings comprising the homestead at Booubyjan. The 1950s saw the destruction of an early kitchen to the rear of the Dining Room, and its replacement with another kitchen built onto the rear of the Homestead. In the 1970s a storm unroofed both the Cottage and the Homestead, and these were replaced, though not in the previous steeply pitched Dutch gabled roof form, but simply with hipped corrugated iron roofs. Photographs taken in 1928 by the travelling photographer of The Queenslander, show the remarkably unchanged state of the buildings from this time, particularly the interiors which retain many pieces of furniture and other items from earlier periods of inhabitancy.  Description  Booubyjan Homestead is situated on a 9000-acre run in the Kilkivan Shire (later part of Gympie Region), about north of the small town of Tansey, which is north of Goomeri. The homestead is on an elevated section of the run, allowing comprehensive views of the surrounding run. The complex consists of timber buildings, linked by open verandahs and covered walkways. Three principal buildings facing north east comprise the residence, with various outbuildings to the south and west of these. The one storeyed building located centrally in the complex, the largest of the buildings, is referred to as the Homestead. This building, which is elevated on timber stumps, is of drop slab timber construction, although the front of the building has been faced with horizontal timber weatherboards. The hipped corrugated iron roof is centrally pierced with a brick chimney shaft, with simple brick corbelling and chimney hood. Verandahs surround the building although these have been infilled and altered to the south west or rear of the building. Access is provided to the verandah via a centrally located open tread timber stair, which is emphasised with a planted trellis. Four half glazed French doors with transom lights above open from the homestead to the front verandah, and similar doors open on the north western and south eastern sides of the building. The corrugated iron verandah awning is supported on chamfered timber posts, and the soffit is clad with fibrous cement sheeting to the north west of the building. Internally, the Homestead is divided into three principal rooms, to which the French doors provide access. These rooms are internally clad with fibrous cement sheeting braced with timber strips. Some of the internal walls are covered with calico and hessian lining. A chimney piece, with rudimentary timber mantle, is found in the largest of the rooms on the north west end of the homestead, and another in the adjacent room. The rear of this building is lined with infilled and open sections of verandah, and also with substantial additions comprising a laundry, kitchen and billiard room. The timber frame additions are externally clad with horizontal weatherboards and internally with fibrous cement sheeting, similar to that found in the front rooms of this building. To the north west of the homestead, abutting its verandah on this side, is a one-roomed timber building known as the Dining Room. This is thought by the Lawless family to be the oldest building on the site. The building has a hipped corrugated iron roof and verandahs to the north east and north west, the awnings of which are incorporated in the main roof made discernible by a slight change of pitch. The walls of the building are of drop slab construction, and apparent on the underside of the verandah are early shingles and framing. The building is constructed with a system of two roof structures, an external iron clad covering and another timber framed and clad under- roof which meets the top of the external walls, allowing the outer roof to remain at a distance above the walls, allowing a gentler pitch. Three sets of half glazed French doors open onto the verandah from the interior. The interior walls of the Dining Room are plastered, with stained timber wainscotting to dado rail height. The stained timber beaded board ceiling is coved, following the rake of the under roof previously mentioned. To the south east of the Homestead and connected to its verandah with a covered walkway, is a smaller timber building known as the Cottage. Encircling it are wide verandahs on all sides, with an infill section of the south east. This building is constructed of vertical slabs of timber housed in recessed timber sections at the top and base of the wall, and the building features a similar double roof system to that previously described. The verandah is supported on chamfered timber posts. Half glazed French doors give access to the three internal room from the verandah, though some of these have been replaced with single half glazed doors. Internally the Cottage is clad with fibrous cement sheeting, braced with timber strips. Several outbuildings of various ages surround the three principal buildings, these include a power house to the south-west of the homestead; an early bush house and entrance gates to the north west of the Dining Room; sheds, stores and garages to the north west of the bush house. Many mature trees and plants surround the homestead, these include a hoop pine.  Heritage listing  Booubyjan Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. As one of the earliest pastoral stations in Queensland, Booubyjan Homestead demonstrates the pattern of land use and settlement in rural areas of the state from the late 1840s and, in particular the development of the Burnett region. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Booubyjan provides rare surviving evidence of early timber building construction techniques, including drop slab and vertical slab construction, and shingled roofing. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. Booubyjan Homestead has the potential to yield further information through archaeological research about timber building construction techniques of the mid nineteenth century and of the early pastoral station. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The homestead is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of early Queensland homesteads, constructed as the head station of a large run. The various accretions, dating from the 1860s, demonstrate the growth of the Lawless family. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The buildings are picturesquely situated in an early garden at the crest of an incline, and have aesthetic significance. Booubyjan Homestead has a number of significant furniture pieces, important to the understanding of the history of the homestead. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Booubyjan Homestead has special associations with the Lawless family, who originally took up the land in 1847, and have remained on the run to this day. The family included early pioneers of the Burnett region.

By then he had married another slave, Mary. His wife Mary Meachum had been taken by her owners when they moved to St. Louis, Missouri in 1815. Meachum bought her freedom as well, after moving to the river port city to be with her.\\"John Meachum\\", Black Past Achievements In St. Louis, Meachum met white Baptist missionary John Mason Peck. With Peck, he started the African Church of St. Louis (later renamed as the First Baptist Church of St. Louis). It was the first black church in the state. Meachum taught religious and secular classes there to both free and enslaved black students. After he was ordained in 1825, Meachum constructed a separate building at the same location for his church and school, which he called \\"The Candle Tallow School.\\"Tim 0'Neil, \\"First Black Minister Founds Church, Buys Freedom for Slaves\\"], St. Louis Post Dispatch, April 26, 2014 The school, which charged a dollar per person in tuition for those who could afford to pay, attracted 300 pupils. Around the same time, St. Louis passed an ordinance banning the education of free blacks, and Meachum had to close the school. In 1847, the slave state of Missouri banned all education for black people, one of several restrictions on the lives of both enslaved blacks and free people of color. It also prohibited them from having independent black religious services without a white law enforcement officer present, or from holding any meetings for education or religion.The statute read as follows: \\"Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows: 1\\\\. No person shall keep or teach any school for the instruction of negroes or mulattoes, in reading or writing, in this State. 2\\\\. No meeting or assemblage of negroes or mulattoes, for the purpose of religious worship, or preaching, shall be held or permitted where the services are performed or conducted by negroes or mulattoes, unless some sheriff, constable, marshal, police officer, or justice of the peace, shall be present during all the time of such meeting or assemblage, in order to prevent all seditious speeches, and disorderly and unlawful conduct of every kind. 3\\\\. All meetings of negroes or mulattoes, for the purposes mentioned in the two preceding sections, shall be considered unlawful assemblages, and shall be suppressed by sheriffs, constables, and other public officers.\\" Laws of the State of Missouri Passed at the First Session of the Fourteenth General Assembly (City of Jefferson: James Lusk Public Printer, 1847) at pp. 103-04. In response, Meachum moved his classes to a steamboat in the middle of the Mississippi River, which was beyond the reach of Missouri law. He provided the school with a library, desks, and chairs, and called it the \\"Floating Freedom School\\".Robert W. Tabscott \\"John Berry Meachum Defied The Law to Educate Blacks\\" , St. Louis Beacon, August 25, 2009Loren Schweninger, Black Property Owners In The South, 1790-1915, University of Illinois Press, 1997 \\"Trace the Origin of the \\"Floating School Story\\", University of Missouri St. Louis Among Meachum's students was James Milton Turner. After the Civil War, he founded the Lincoln Institute, the first school in Missouri for higher education for black students. Meachum and his wife, Mary, helped enslaved people gain their freedom by supporting them through the Underground Railroad, which helped people get to free states, and by purchasing their freedom. Sometimes they transported people by boat across the Mississippi River to the free state of Illinois. Through profits from his successful carpentry business, Meachum purchased and freed 20 enslaved individuals. He trained them in carpentry and other trades so that they could earn a living.\\"Notable Kentucky African Americans Database\\", University of Kentucky Nearly every person freed paid Meachum back, so, he continued to be able to free others. As a slave owner, Meachum was sued by some of his slaves for their freedom and for his treatment of them as workers.Vandervelde, Lea. Redemption Songs, Courtroom Stories of Slavery, Oxford University Press USA, 2013 In 1846, Meachum published a pamphlet, \\"An Address to All of the Colored Citizens of the United States,\\" in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He emphasized the importance of collective unity and self-respect. He said that black people needed to receive practical, hands-on education so they would could support themselves after emancipation.Dennis L. Hurst, \\"The Reverend John Berry Meachum (1789-1854) of St. Louis: Prophet and Entrepreneurial Educator in Historiographical Perspective,\\" The North Star: A Journal of African American Religious History 7:2 (2004) Death and legacy Meachum died in his pulpit on February 19, 1854. He is buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis. His wife Mary continued her work with the Underground Railroad. She was arrested in 1855 at the river's edge for transporting slaves to freedom across the Mississippi River to Illinois, a free state. Beginning in 2003, the work of John and Mary Meachum on the Underground Railroad has been commemorated annually by re- enactors at the site of Mary's arrest in St. Louis. It has been named as the Mary Meachum Crossing at the Mississippi River, and is designated on the Great River Greenway's Riverfront Trail along the river. In 2015 the event also celebrated the 150th anniversary of the end of the Civil War.\\"Reenactors celebrate end of slavery at Mary Meachum Freedom Crossing\\", St. Louis Public Radio, May 9, 2015 A mural painted on the river side of the levee wall commemorates her work. The First African Baptist Church, now First Baptist Church, moved to 14th and Clark streets in 1848. In 1917 it moved again, to its present address at Bell Avenue. The church later purchased the adjacent four-family flat and converted it into an educational building. The church had a fire and burned to the ground in 1940. The congregation had it reconstructed on the same site within thirteen months.Donnie D.

A PAPR, gown, and biosafety cabinet in use in a BSL-3 laboratory. All parts of the PAPR are visible: the waist unit holding the fan, filter, and battery; the hose; and the mask, in this case a flexible, loose-fitting one. A PAPR with a rigid, tight-fitting mask A powered air- purifying respirator (PAPR) is a type of respirator used to safeguard workers against contaminated air. PAPRs consist of a headgear-and-fan assembly that takes ambient air contaminated with one or more type of pollutant or pathogen, actively removes (filters) a sufficient proportion of these hazards, and then delivers the clean air to the user's face or mouth and nose. They have a higher assigned protection factor than filtering facepiece respirators such as N95 masks. PAPRs are sometimes called positive-pressure masks, blower units, or just blowers. Description The modularity of PAPRs allows them to be customized for different working environments. Regardless of type, a PAPR consists of: * some kind of headgear (mask or hood), * a powered (motor- driven) fan which forces incoming air into the device, * a filter (or multiple filters) for delivery to the user for breathing, and * a battery or other power source. The mask may be hard and tight-fitting, or flexible and loose- fitting. The former affords a higher level of protection, but is less comfortable. Tight-fitting PAPRs require a fit test, while loose-fitting ones do not. This makes loose-fitting PAPRs useful when a fit test for a tight- fitting respirator cannot be successfully passed, for example when facial hair is present. Masks may be reusable or disposable. Some masks allow the full face to be seen by others, aiding in interpersonal communication. The fan, filter, and power-pack may be carried around freely by the user, often secured by a belt around the waist. Alternatively, with certain units, the air is fed to the user via lengthy tubing while the fans and filters are remotely mounted. PAPRs have low breathing resistance, unlike filtering facepiece respirators such as N95 masks. A PAPR may have adjustable air flow rates for added comfort. While they are often referred to as positive pressure masks, they are not true positive-pressure devices as overbreathing can overcome the pressure supplied by the fan. Filters PAPRs may be outfitted with mechanical filters for atmospheres with particulate contamination, with a chemical cartridge for atmospheres with toxic gases or vapors, or both in combination. PAPRs can provide an assigned protection factor between 25 and 1000 depending on the type, as compared to an N95 mask's assigned protection factor of 10. Loose-fitting PAPRs have an AFP of 25, and PAPRS with elastomeric masks that seal to the face (similar to those in elastomeric respirator masks) have a PAPR of 1000.:File:Respirator Types.webm, time 8:19 (loose) and 8:43 (tight-fitting) In the United States, HE (high-efficiency) filters are the class of particulate filter used with PAPRs. These are 99.97% efficient against 0.3 micron particles, the same as a P100 filter. PAPR HE filters used in industry are generally re-used until they are soiled, damaged, or reduce PAPR air flow below specified levels. In healthcare settings involving a live virus, CDC recommends that a practical replacement cycle be implemented. The type of filter incorporated into a PAPR must be appropriate to the contaminants that need to be removed. Some respirators are designed to remove fine particulate matter such as the dust created during various woodworking processes, or from working with mineral-based materials. When used with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, airborne particles containing pathogens (viruses, bacteria) smaller than 5 microns will be removed. (PAPRs are typically required for lab workers in BSL-3 facilities, and sometimes in BSL-2 as well.) When used in combination with the correct filters, [PAPRs] are suitable for working with volatile organic compounds such as those used in many spray paints. At the same time, the filters that are suitable for volatile substances must typically have their filter elements replaced more often than particulate filters. In addition, there is some confusion over terminology. Some literature and users will refer to a particulate filtering unit as a dust mask or filter and then use the term respirator to mean a unit that can handle organic solvents.  Usage  dead space, and, since it is being used against asbestos, exhalation valves (white). The hose connects to a PAPR filter-pump. According to the NIOSH Respirator Selection Logic, PAPRs are recommended for concentrations of hazardous particulates or gases that are greater than the relevant occupational exposure limit but less than the immediately dangerous to life or health (IDLH) level and the manufacturer's maximum-use concentration, subject to the respirator having a sufficient assigned protection factor. For substances hazardous to the eyes, a respirator equipped with a full facepiece, helmet, or hood is recommended. PAPRs are not effective during firefighting, in an oxygen-deficient atmosphere, or in an unknown atmosphere; in these situations a self-contained breathing apparatus or supplied-air respirator is recommended instead. PAPRs have the advantage of eliminating breathing resistance caused by unpowered negative-pressure respirators such as N95 masks. This makes them usable by persons who are medically disqualified from negative-pressure respirators. Loose-fitting PAPRs may also be selected for people who cannot pass a fit test due to facial hair or other reasons. PAPRs have disadvantages in terms of ergonomic impacts, and they restrict peripheral vision. = In healthcare = Because they provide higher assigned protection factors, PAPRs are suitable for use during aerosol-generating procedures and by hospital first receivers. In healthcare settings, CDC recommends cleaning of all components except the filter after each use; care must be taken to select PAPRs that are not damaged or deteriorate due to cleaning and disinfecting agents.Racal suits consist of a PAPR combined with a separate protective suit. They are used in healthcare settings, in this case by the U.S. Army Aeromedical Isolation Team at Fort Detrick, Marylandalt=left In healthcare, a product known as the Racal suit can be used, consisting of a plastic suit and a PAPR fitted with HEPA filters. They were used by the U.S. Army Aeromedical Isolation Team to perform medical evacuations of patients with highly infectious diseases. =For CBRN defense= chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear contaminants (CBRN) Some PAPRs have special certification for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear contaminants (CBRN). In the United States, they must be certified to resist permeation of chemical warfare agents, which may involve additional protective coverings; that gas or vapor will not pass through the filter before a specified amount of time; and its ability to fit a wide range of facial sizes and shapes. Under immediately dangerous to life or health (IDLH) conditions, tight‐fitting full facepiece gas mask respirators with canisters (those with \\"14G approval\\") with CBRN approval may be used for escape, but loose‐fitting hoods and cartridges (those with \\"23C approval\\") with CBRN approval may not. Neither may be used to enter an IDLH atmosphere. The 23C CBRN PAPRs also must not be used if liquid droplet exposure occurs.

It was first introduced by Chris Harris and Mike Stephens in 1988 upon the improvement of Moravec's corner detector. Compared to the previous one, Harris' corner detector takes the differential of the corner score into account with reference to direction directly, instead of using shifting patches for every 45 degree angles, and has been proved to be more accurate in distinguishing between edges and corners. Since then, it has been improved and adopted in many algorithms to preprocess images for subsequent applications.  Introduction  A corner is a point whose local neighborhood stands in two dominant and different edge directions. In other words, a corner can be interpreted as the junction of two edges, where an edge is a sudden change in image brightness. Corners are the important features in the image, and they are generally termed as interest points which are invariant to translation, rotation and illumination. Although corners are only a small percentage of the image, they contain the most important features in restoring image information, and they can be used to minimize the amount of processed data for motion tracking, image stitching, building 2D mosaics, stereo vision, image representation and other related computer vision areas. In order to capture the corners from the image, researchers have proposed many different corner detectors including the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) operator and the Harris operator which are most simple, efficient and reliable for use in corner detection. These two popular methodologies are both closely associated with and based on the local structure matrix. Compared to the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi corner detector, the Harris corner detector provides good repeatability under changing illumination and rotation, and therefore, it is more often used in stereo matching and image database retrieval. Although there still exists drawbacks and limitations, the Harris corner detector is still an important and fundamental technique for many computer vision applications.  Development of Harris Corner Detection Algorithm  Without loss of generality, we will assume a grayscale 2-dimensional image is used. Let this image be given by I. Consider taking an image patch (x, y) \\\\in W(window) and shifting it by (\\\\Delta x,\\\\Delta y). The sum of squared differences (SSD) between these two patches, denoted f, is given by: : f(\\\\Delta x,\\\\Delta y) = \\\\underset{(x_k,y_k)\\\\in W}\\\\sum\\\\left(I(x_k,y_k) - I(x_k+\\\\Delta x,y_k+\\\\Delta y)\\\\right)^2 I(x+\\\\Delta x,y+\\\\Delta y) can be approximated by a Taylor expansion. Let I_x and I_y be the partial derivatives of I, such that : I(x+\\\\Delta x,y+\\\\Delta y) \\\\approx I(x,y) + I_x(x,y)\\\\Delta x+I_y(x,y)\\\\Delta y This produces the approximation : f(\\\\Delta x,\\\\Delta y) \\\\approx \\\\underset{(x,y)\\\\in W}\\\\sum \\\\left( I_x(x,y)\\\\Delta x + I_y(x,y)\\\\Delta y \\\\right)^2, which can be written in matrix form: : f(\\\\Delta x,\\\\Delta y) \\\\approx \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\Delta x & \\\\Delta y \\\\end{pmatrix} M \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\Delta x \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Delta y \\\\end{pmatrix}, where M is the structure tensor, : M = \\\\underset{(x,y)\\\\in W}\\\\sum \\\\begin{bmatrix} I_x^2 & I_x I_y \\\\\\\\\\\\ I_x I_y & I_y^2 \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\underset{(x,y)\\\\in W}\\\\sum I_x^2 &\\\\underset{(x,y)\\\\in W} \\\\sum I_x I_y \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\underset{(x,y)\\\\in W}\\\\sum I_x I_y & \\\\underset{(x,y)\\\\in W}\\\\sum I_y^2 \\\\end{bmatrix}  Process of Harris Corner Detection Algorithm  Commonly, Harris corner detector algorithm can be divided into five steps. # Color to grayscale # Spatial derivative calculation # Structure tensor setup # Harris response calculation # Non-maximum suppression = Color to grayscale = If we use Harris corner detector in a color image, the first step is to convert it into a grayscale image, which will enhance the processing speed. The value of the gray scale pixel can be computed as a weighted sums of the values R, B and G of the color image, :\\\\sum_{C\\\\,\\\\in\\\\,\\\\\\\\{R,B,G\\\\\\\\}} w_C \\\\cdot C, where, e.g., :w_R=0.299,\\\\ w_B=0.587,\\\\ w_G=1-(w_R+w_B). =Spatial derivative calculation = Next, we are going to compute I_x( x, y) and I_y( x, y). = Structure tensor setup = With I_x( x, y) , I_y( x, y) , we can construct the structure tensor M . = Harris response calculation= For x\\\\ll y, one has \\\\tfrac{x\\\\cdot y}{x+y}=x\\\\tfrac{1}{1+x/y}\\\\approx x. In this step, we compute the smallest eigenvalue of the structure tensor using that approximation: \\\\lambda _{min} \\\\approx \\\\frac{ \\\\lambda _1 \\\\lambda _2} {(\\\\lambda _1+\\\\lambda _2)} = \\\\frac{\\\\det(M)} {\\\\mathrm{tr}(M)} with the trace \\\\mathrm{tr}(M) = m_{11} + m_{22} . Another commonly used Harris response calculation is shown as below, R = \\\\lambda _1 \\\\lambda _2 - k\\\\cdot(\\\\lambda _1 + \\\\lambda _2)^2 = \\\\det(M) - k\\\\cdot\\\\mathrm{tr}(M)^2 where k is an empirically determined constant; k \\\\in [0.04, 0.06] . = Non-maximum suppression = In order to pick up the optimal values to indicate corners, we find the local maxima as corners within the window which is a 3 by 3 filter.

Established in 1985, the program was a collaboration of most of Oregon’s public universities. OCATE later was absorbed by Portland State University and discontinued in 2006. History OCATE was created by the Oregon Board of Higher Education in 1985 in an effort to encourage state engineering schools to collaborate in an effort to increase high-tech education in the state. It was established with $1 million in funding provided by the Oregon Lottery and first held classes at Tektronix. Politician and businessman Tom Bruggere was one of the people credited with founding the center, and served as chairman of the group in the early 2000s. Along with the Oregon Joint Graduate Schools of Engineering, OCATE was designed to coordinate Oregon public universities’ technology education. In 1988, the state recruited the private Oregon Graduate Center to teach some of the OCATE courses. Intel scientist Justin Rattner was given OCATE’s Globe Award in 1989. OCATE merged with the Lintner Center in 1991. The center was forced to cut 22 positions in 1992 due to statewide budget cuts. OCATE was part of a pilot project started in 1994 with a National Aeronautics and Space Administration grant to create a high-speed network linking it to Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU), the Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and Technology) since merged with OHSU, the University of Oregon, Portland State University, and Oregon State University. The $4.5 million Nero Project would provide speeds of 155 MPS. The school moved to the Capital Center in 1995, which was a former Tektronix's facility. It began a lecture series in 1996, and converted to mostly a distance education program in 2003. The program was discontinued in 2006 and absorbed by Portland State University's School of Extended Studies. The School of Extended Studies at PSU was eliminated in 2012 and the programs under the School moved into Colleges and Schools at PSU. At that time OCATE was moved to the College of Engineering and Computer Science. Currently the Maseeh College of Engineering and Computer Science (MCECS) offers Graduate level courses in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and Engineering and Technology Management (ETM) at PCC-Willow Creek. The courses are taught in the evening and are mainly for working professionals on the Westside. Courses are offered in technical areas that are relevant to engineers working at neighboring technology companies. Most of the courses are project-based and provide an opportunity to meet other engineers with similar interests working in related areas. Sufficient courses are offered to meet the degree requirements for our masters program without having to take time off from work during the day or having to travel to downtown Portland. Courses are offered to support both students who are and are not seeking a graduate degree. Details OCATE’s mission statement was to “act as a facilitator, coordinator, and promoter of cooperative, world-class, graduate-level, advanced technology education. OCATE will bring together the best faculty from Oregon's public and private higher education institutions, leading industrial researchers, and out-of-state experts to provide state-of-the-art technological and business education to the advanced technology industries in Oregon.” The center was located at the Capitol Center in Hillsboro, though it had a Beaverton address.

Background  The 7th Congress was the first Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea held since the 6th Congress in 1980, despite party rules stipulating that Congresses be held every five years. The purpose of the Congress was to review the party's work from the time period since the 6th Congress, but also to instill public loyalty toward the leadership of the country. On 30 October 2015, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported that the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea announced a decision to hold a Congress in early May 2016, saying:  Preparations  On 17 February 2016 joint slogans were issued by Workers' Party of Korea's Central Military Commission and Central Committee, and they were published by Rodong Sinmun and KCNA. The Congress was preceded by a \\"70-day battle\\" mass mobilization campaign. Human Right Watch claims that the campaign meant uncompensated and forced labor for people across the country, including children, and that the object of the campaign was to boost outputs in manufacture and agriculture and demonstrate loyalty. A five-day holiday was declared for the duration of the Congress.  Congress  April 25 House of Culture decorated for the Congress The Congress was opened on 6 May 2016 at the April 25 House of Culture in Pyongyang, in the presence of 3,467 voting delegates. Unlike the last congress, there were no major foreign delegations, but 128 foreign journalists from 12 countries were allowed to cover the event. Reporters were kept outside of the venue, and a recording of the opening event was only televised later in the evening. The Congress opened with an address by Kim Jong-un. In it, he praised the country's January 2016 nuclear test and satellite launch. After having chosen its presidium and secretariat, the Congress approved its agenda: #Review of the work of the 6th WPK Central Committee #Review of the work of the WPK Central Auditing Commission #Revision of the WPK Charter #Election of Kim Jong-un to the leadership of the WPK #Election of members to the central leadership organs of the WPK The Congress continued on 7 May with Kim Jong- un's report on the work of the 6th Central Committee. In the report, Kim Jong- un reiterated the country's nuclear policy, calling it \\"a responsible nuclear weapons state\\". According to Kim, North Korea would not use nuclear weapons unless its sovereignty was violated. With regards to the economy, Kim announced the country's first Five-Year Plan since the 1980s. Speeches by other delegates expressed support for Kim's report. A decision on approving Kim's report was unanimously adopted on 9 May. In it, the party vowed to continue building a more extensive nuclear arsenal. A report on the work of the Central Auditing Commission was then heard. On the 9th, foreign journalists were briefly let in the Congress venue for the first time, during the announcement of Kim Jong-un's election as Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea. The Congress ended on the 9th, and the day also saw a huge parade in Pyongyang in its honor. = Officials elected by the Congress = On May 9, Kim Jong-un was re-elected to the leadership of the party. His title in this capacity was changed from First Secretary to Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea, a title reminiscent of that held by Kim Il-sung until 1966: Chairman of the WPK Central Committee. 15 members were elected to the 7th Central Auditing Commission: Choe Sung-ho, Pak Myong-sun, Kim Kyong-nam, Hwang Chol-sik, Kim Yong-chol, Ri Yong-ik, Kim Myong-hun, Kye Yong-sam, Jo Jong-ho, Kye Myong- chol, Jang Jong-ju, Pho Hui-song, Jong Pong-sok, Choe Kwon-su and Ho Kwang-uk. The Commission soon convened and chose as its Chairman Choe Sung-ho and Vice- Chairwoman Pak Myong-sun.  7th Central Committee  129 members and 106 alternate members were elected to the 7th Central Committee, including Kim Jong-un. It held its first plenum immediately after the Congress, on 10 May, and elected officials.

Chapala was the third named storm of the 2015 North Indian Ocean cyclone season. It developed as a depression on 28 October off western India, and strengthened a day later into a cyclonic storm. Chapala then rapidly intensified amid favorable conditions. On 30 October, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) estimated that Chapala attained peak three-minute sustained winds of 215 km/h (130 mph). The American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated sustained winds of 240 km/h (150 mph), making Chapala among the strongest cyclones on record in the Arabian Sea. After peak intensity, Chapala skirted the Yemeni island of Socotra on 1 November, becoming the first hurricane-force storm there since 1922. High winds and heavy rainfall resulted in an island- wide power outage, and severe damage was compounded by Cyclone Megh, which struck Yemen a week later. While Chapala encountered less favorable conditions after leaving Socotra, it maintained much of its intensity; upon entering the Gulf of Aden on 2 November, it became the strongest known cyclone in that body of water. Chapala brushed the northern coast of Somalia, killing tens of thousands of animals and wrecking 350 houses. Ahead of the cyclone's final landfall, widespread evacuations occurred across southeastern Yemen, including in areas controlled by al-Qaeda, amid the country's ongoing civil war. Early on 3 November, the storm made landfall near Mukalla, Yemen, as a very severe cyclonic storm and the strongest storm on record to strike the nation. Chapala weakened into a remnant low the next day over land. Several years' worth of heavy rainfall inundated coastal areas, damaging roads and hundreds of homes. Eight people died in Yemen, a low total credited to the evacuations, and another 65 were injured. After cyclones Chapala and Megh, several countries, non-government organizations, and agencies within the United Nations provided monetary and material assistance to Yemen. The country faced food and fuel shortages, and residual storm effects contributed to an outbreak of locusts and dengue fever, the latter of which killed seven people. Meteorological history The monsoon trough spawned a fragmented area of convection, or thunderstorms, southwest of India on 25 October, 2015. The system was located within an environment of moderate wind shear, which prevented early development but decreased over time. On 26 October, the system developed a distinct low pressure area, which gradually became better defined, with good outflow to the north and south. At 03:00 UTC on 28 October, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the system as a depression. Nine hours later, the agency upgraded it to a deep depression, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 04A at 21:00 UTC. The deep depression moved slowly to the north at first, steered by an anticyclone to the northeast. The IMD upgraded the system to a cyclonic storm at 00:00 UTC on 29 October, giving it the name Chapala. Around the same time, the storm turned towards the west, influenced by another anticyclone to its northwest. With low wind shear, as well as record-warm water temperatures, Chapala began a 33-hour period of rapid deepening, in which the barometric pressure dropped 59 hPa (1.74 inHg). The storm developed well-defined rainbands and thunderstorms that consolidated into an eye feature. The JTWC estimated Chapala attained hurricane-force winds of 120 km/h (75 mph) at 12:00 UTC on 29 October. Meanwhile, the IMD upgraded Chapala to a severe cyclonic storm at 09:00 UTC that day, and further to a very severe cyclonic storm at 18:00 UTC. By early on 30 October, Chapala had developed a well-defined eye wide. Based on satellite intensity estimates using the Dvorak technique, the JTWC assessed Chapala as a high-end Category 4-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale at 06:00 UTC with one-minute sustained winds of 240 km/h (150 mph). Based on their estimate, Chapala was the second- strongest cyclone on record over the Arabian Sea; at the time, only Cyclone Gonu of 2007 was stronger, and Cyclone Kyarr tied it in 2019. Meanwhile, the IMD upgraded Chapala to an extremely severe cyclonic storm at 00:00 UTC on 30 October and estimated peak three-minute sustained winds of 215 km/h (130 mph) at 09:00 UTC. The agency estimated a minimum central pressure of . alt=Chapala approaching Yemen on 2 November At the time of peak intensity, Chapala was moving to the west-southwest due to a ridge to the north. Initially, the IMD forecast that Chapala would intensify further into a super cyclonic storm, and the JTWC anticipated t strengthening into a Category 5-equivalent. Instead, the storm began an eyewall replacement cycle on 30 October, causing the inner eyewall to degrade and an outer eyewall to form; this resulted in a slight drop in intensity. As well, drier air began affecting the storm, causing the thunderstorms around the eye to diminish. Chapala maintained much of its intensity due to strong outflow in all directions, especially to the northeast due to a tropical upper tropospheric trough over India, despite increased wind shear. The new eyewall became established on 31 October, reaching a diameter of , although the thunderstorms around the eye continued to weaken. On 1 November, Chapala passed just north of the island of Socotra, marking the island's first hurricane-force impact since 1922. After the cyclone passed Socotra, its convective core became better-defined due to improved outflow. Chapala entered the Gulf of Aden on 2 November, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone on record in that region. At 12:00 UTC that day, the IMD downgraded the system to a very severe cyclonic storm, after Chapala had been an extremely severe cyclonic storm for 78 hours. The structure became disorganized due to increased easterly wind shear and interaction with the Arabian Peninsula to the north, allowing cooler and drier air to enter the circulation. Around this time, the storm began moving more to the west- northwest toward Yemen, rounding the southwestern periphery of a ridge. Between 01:00-02:00 UTC on 3 November, Chapala made landfall near Mukalla with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). This marked the first Yemeni hurricane-intensity landfall on record, and the first severe cyclonic storm to hit the country since May 1960. The center straddled the coast before heading inland. Chapala quickly weakened over land, degenerating into a depression by 00:00 UTC on 4 November and weakening into a remnant low pressure area three hours later. Preparations and impact =Oman= By 30 October, well ahead of the storm, officials in Oman relayed the potential for flash flooding and high waves along the coast. The public was advised to stay away from low-lying areas, while fishermen were asked to avoid venturing into the sea, because of the potential for waves reaching in height. Officials closed schools in Dhofar Governorate. The storm ultimately passed south of the country, sparing the feared impacts from the cyclone. =Somalia= Ahead of the storm, the threat of high seas spurred the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to dissuade Somali and Ethiopian refugees from crossing to Yemen. Large swells produced by Chapala caused extensive coastal damage in Somalia, damaging 280 boats. Eastern Puntland was hardest-hit, where the cyclone damaged of roads, and nine schools; about 2,000 students had to continue learning in tents. In the Bari region, Chapala wrecked 350 houses, leaving thousands of residents homeless. Also in the region, the storm killed 25,000 animals and downed 5,100 trees. Heavy rainfall from the storm spread to the northeastern tip of Somalia, and westward to the Berbera District in Somaliland. There, the storm killed 3,000 sheep and goats, as well as 200 camels; this severely affected the local nomadic population who rely on the livestock for their livelihood. Continuous rainfall forced families to leave their homes in low-lying areas for higher grounds. After the storm, the government of Somaliland distributed rice, sugar, and plastic sheets. After Chapala and the subsequent Cyclone Megh, the local Red Cross chapter distributed blankets, sleeping mats, and mattresses to the affected families. The CARE relief agency provided US$300,000 toward relief goods and the restoration of safe water. =Yemen= alt=Video of Chapala making landfall on Yemen Cyclone Chapala was slated to be the strongest tropical cyclone ever to affect Yemen, and this sparked fears of catastrophic flooding amid the ongoing civil war. The United Nations indicated that Yemen was in the midst of \\"one of the largest humanitarian crises in the world.\\" Rainfall was forecast to total more than several years' worth of precipitation in some areas, bringing fears of \\"massive debris flows and flash flooding.\\" Some weather models showed peak accumulations of or more. Fears of damage and loss of life were compounded by the power vacuum in areas controlled by al-Qaeda, particularly the port city of Mukalla where approximately 300,000 people lived. The internationally recognized government, which controls most of southern Yemen, announced the suspension of schools in four governorates: Hadhramaut, Socotra, Al Mahrah and Shabwah. Yemen's meteorological agency told residents to stay at least 1 km (0.6 mi) inland. About 18,750 people left their homes ahead of the storm on the Yemen mainland. Most people sheltered in public buildings like schools or hospitals, or stayed with relatives. The World Health Organization distributed gasoline to ambulances and hospitals to ensure they would continue operating effectively. Al-Qaeda controlled Mukalla evacuated a coastal neighborhood. Socotra alt=Flooding in Socotra on 1 November On Socotra, over 1,000 families evacuated to schools set up as shelters. On 1 November, Chapala produced hurricane-force winds and heavy rainfall to the island. Residents described rainfall as the most severe in decades. Northeastern areas of the island were rendered inaccessible due to flooding, forcing residents to ride out the storm on their roofs. Chapala damaged Socotra's main port, and also caused an island-wide power outage. The cyclone destroyed 237 homes on the island and damaged 497 others, forcing about 18,000 people to leave their homes. Chapala caused at least 200 injuries. Despite initial reports of three deaths on the island, there were no confirmed fatalities on Socotra, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Mainland High winds, strong waves, and heavy rainfall affected the southern Yemen coast. The weather station at Riyan Airport reported sustained winds of , with gusts to , before it stopped recording; the continued increase in winds supported that Chapala made landfall in Yemen as the equivalent of a hurricane. Some parts of the region received 610 mm (24 in) of rainfall, 700% of the yearly average, in just 48 hours. As the area usually receives less than 50 mm (2 in) of rainfall per year, the ground was unable to absorb much of the water. The resulting runoff triggered flash floods, collected along wadis, or typically dry river beds, and inundated coastal areas several kilometres inland. Across Yemen's mainland, Chapala destroyed 214 homes and damaged another 600. The storm caused eight deaths - five by drowning and three inside collapsed homes. One of the deaths occurred as far west as Aden, where a fisherman drowned amid rough seas. Officials attributed the low death toll to the widespread evacuations ahead of the storm. About 65 people were injured, including 25 in Mukalla. Aon Benfield estimated nationwide damage in the hundreds of millions (USD). Flooding from Chapala damaged crops, killed livestock, and wrecked boats. There, the storm damaged seven health facilities, including two in the nation's fifth-largest city, Mukalla. The storm severed phone lines, disrupted water access after damaging pipes, and damaged 90 houses. Residents in Mukalla took shelter in schools as the storm destroyed the waterfront. The city's main hospital was closed because of flooding, but reopened two days later. About of primary and secondary roads in and around Mukalla, including the coastal road from Aden to the city, were clogged with mud due to the floods and landslides. About 80% of the village of Jilah was flooded, damaging 250 houses. Aftermath alt=Satellite image of Chapala after its landfall over Yemen The Yemeni Government declared a state of emergency for Socotra shortly after the storm's passage on 1 November. The local Red Cross gave cooked meals and tarps to the island's residents. Several Persian Gulf countries sent 43 planes with supplies to the island by 19 November. Neighboring Oman sent 14 cargo planes' worth of food totaling 270 tons, as well as blankets and tents. The United Arab Emirates also sent a ship and a plane carrying 500 tons of food, 10 tons of blankets and tents, and 1,200 barrels of diesel fuel. The International Organization for Migration provided 2,000 shelter kits as well as a medical team to Socotra. Due to damage to the island's main port, residents built a makeshift pathway to help the distribution of aid. In the days after the storm, airstrikes and attacks continued elsewhere in the country. One week after Chapala, Cyclone Megh followed a similar path. Together, the passages of Chapala and Megh near Socotra and mainland Yemen killed 26 people and displaced 47,000 people. Relief distribution was disrupted due to the poor communications in the region, worsened by the ongoing civil war, with the hardest hit areas under al-Qaeda control; aid trucks had to pass security clearances, resulting in delays. Workers began restoring communications and clearing roads in the days after the storm. By 19 November, most of the displaced residents had returned home, although some remained in shelters due to housing damage. Southern portions of Yemen saw food and fuel shortages following the two storms. Mukalla experienced an outbreak of dengue fever by January 2016 due to the floods, affecting 1,040 people; earlier efforts to kill disease carrying mosquitoes were ineffective due to residual floods and unsanitary conditions. Seven people died due to the outbreak. Flooding from Chapala led to a locust outbreak in March 2016, which spread across Yemen and reached as far as Pakistan. Agencies under the United Nations and non-government organizations provided assistance to the storm victims, although aid agencies were cautious in helping a city under control of Al Qaeda. The Red Crescent Society of the United Arab Emirates, in conjunction with the Khalifa Foundation and the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre, provided aid to the hardest hit areas of mainland Yemen via an airbridge, as well as over land. United Nations agencies sent 29 trucks carrying 296 tons of non-food items, and the World Health Organization sent a ship from Djibouti with 18 tons of medical supplies. To prevent the spread of disease, officials distributed mosquito nets and began mass-immunizing children under five years old beginning in early November. A national effort to vaccinate against polio was disrupted in six governorates by the cyclone, but was completed by December. Médecins Sans Frontières established a medical clinic in Mukalla while also setting up a water tank. To help with food shortages, the World Food Programme had provided High Energy Biscuits by 30 November to 24,900 people, using pre-stocked supplies. The International Organization for Migration provided of water per day in Shabwah and Abyan governorates, and also helped clean sewage and storm debris. Agencies also delivered hygiene kits and food to the hardest hit areas. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees provided emergency beds, cooking utensils, and other supplies to about 1,600 families.
