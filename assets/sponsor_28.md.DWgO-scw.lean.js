Of the many Rabbi Yose's in the Talmud, Yose Ben Halafta is the one who is simply referred to as Rabbi Yose. Biography He was born at Sepphoris; but his family was of Babylonian-Jewish origin.Yoma 66b According to a genealogical chart found at Jerusalem, he was a descendant of Jonadab ben Rechab.Yerushalmi Ta'anit 4 2; Genesis Rabba 98:13 He was one of Rabbi Akiva's five principal pupils, called \\"the restorers of the Law,\\"Yevamot 63b who were afterward ordained by Judah ben Baba.Sanhedrin 14a He was also a student of Johanan ben Nuri, whose halakhot he transmittedTosefta, Kelim Bava Kamma 2:2; Tosefta Kelim Bava Batra 7:4 and of Eutolemus.Eruvin 35a; Rosh Hashanah 15a It is very likely that he studied much under his father, Halafta, whose authority he invokes in several instances.Bava Kamma 70a; Megillah 17b But his principal teacher was Akiva, whose system he followed in his interpretation of the Law.Pesahim 18a; Yevamot 62b After having been ordained in violation of a Roman edict,Sanhedrin, l.c. Jose fled to Asia Minor,Bava Metzia 84a where he stayed till the edict was abrogated. Later he settled at Usha, then the seat of the Sanhedrin. As he remained silent when his fellow pupil Simeon bar Yohai once attacked the Roman government in his presence, he was forced by the Romans to return to Sepphoris,Shabbat 33b which he found in a decaying state.Bava Batra 75b He established there a flourishing school; and it seems that he died there.Sanhedrin 109a; compare Yerushalmi Avodah Zarah 3:1. Jose's great learning attracted so many pupils that the words \\"that which is altogether just shalt thou follow\\"Deuteronomy 16:20 were interpreted to mean in part \\"follow Jose to Sepphoris\\".Sanhedrin 32b He was highly extolled after his death. His pupil Judah ha-Nasi said: \\"The difference between Jose's generation and ours is like the difference between the Holy of Holies and the most profane.\\"Yerushalmi Gittin 6 9 Owing to Jose's fame as a saint, legend describes him as having met Elijah.Berakhot 3a; Sanhedrin 113b Jose, complying with the levirate law, married the wife of his brother who had died childless; she bore him five sons: Ishmael, Eleazar, Menahem, Halafta (who died in his lifetime), and Eudemus.Yerushalmi Yevamot 1 1 He exemplified Abtalion's dictum, \\"Love work\\";Pirkei Avot 1:10 for he was a tanner,Shabbat 49a a trade then commonly held in contempt.Pesahim 65a Teachings =Halakha= His legal decisions are mentioned throughout the greater part of the Mishnah, as well as in the Baraita and Sifra. The Babylonian Talmud says that in a dispute between Rabbi Jose b. Halafta and Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, the halakha follows Rabbi Jose b. Halafta. So, too, in any dispute between himself and his colleagues, Rabbi Yehuda b. 'Ilai and Rabbi Meir, the rule of practice is in accordance with Rabbi Jose.Babylonian Talmud, Yevamot 46b; Sanhedrin 27a; Yerushalmi Terumot 3:1; Eruvin 51a His teaching was very systematic. He was opposed to controversy, declaring that the antagonism between the schools of Shammai and Hillel made it seem as if there were two Torahs.Sanhedrin 88b For the most part, Jose adopted a compromise between two contending halakhists.Compare Terumot 10:3; Eruvin 8:5 (86a); Yoma, 4:3 (43b) Like his master Akiva, Jose occupied himself with the dots which sometimes accompany the words in the Bible, occasionally basing his halakhot on such dots.Pesahim 9:2 (93b); Menahot 87b. He was generally liberal in his halakhic decisions, especially in interpreting the laws concerning fastsTa'anit 22b and vows.Nedarim 21b, 23a =Aggadah= Jose was also a prominent aggadist. The conversation which he had with a Roman matron, resulting in her conviction of the superiority of the Jewish religion,Genesis Rabba 68:4 shows his great skill in interpreting Biblical verses. Jose is considered to be the author of the Seder Olam Rabba, a chronicle from the creation to the time of Hadrian, for which reason it is called also known as \\"Baraita di Rabbi Jose ben Halafta.\\"Yevamot 82b; Niddah 46b; compare Shabbat 88a This work, though incomplete and too concise, shows Jose's system of arranging material in chronological order. Jose is known for his ethical dicta, which are characteristic, and in which he laid special stress on the study of the Torah.Compare Avot 4:6 A series of Jose's ethical sayingsIn Shabbat 118b shows his tendency toward Essenism. As has been said above, Jose was opposed to disputation. When his companion Judah desired to exclude Me√Ør's disciples from his school, Jose dissuaded him.Kiddushin 52a; Nazir 50a One of his characteristic sayings is, \\"He who indicates the coming of the Messiah, he who hates scholars and their disciples, and the false prophet and the slanderer, will have no part in the future world.\\"Derekh Eretz Rabbah 11 According to BacherMonatsschrift, 42:505-507 this was directed against the Hebrew Christians. = Quotes = *Let your friend's money be as precious to you as your own, and prepare yourself for the study of the Torah since it (i.e. learning and knowledge) is not passed down unto you by way of an inheritance.Avot de-Rabbi Nathan 17:1 *If any man says to you, 'There is worldly wisdom to be found among the gentiles,' believe him.

The series has inspired three soundtracks featuring music from the games. The soundtracks mainly consist of, often experimental, chiptune-based electronic dance music, encompassing electronic genres such as electro, house, techno, hardcore, jungle, ambient, breakbeat, gabber, noise, and trance. The music was produced using the Yamaha FM-synth sound chips of the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis video game console (YM2612) and NEC PC-88 computer (YM2608), along with Koshiro's own audio programming language \\"Music Love,\\" a modified version of the PC-88's Music Macro Language (MML). The soundtracks have been critically acclaimed. They are considered ahead of their time, and as some of the best video game music of all time. The soundtracks have influenced a range of chiptune, electronica, grime and dubstep musicians through to the present day, including artists such as Ikonika, BT, Labrinth, Martyn, Joker, Darkstar, Childish Gambino, and Danger. Streets of Rage When Streets of Rage's development began in 1990, Koshiro was influenced by electronic dance music, or club music, specifically techno and house music, and wanted to be the first to introduce those sounds to chiptune and video game music. Many tracks also have a warm, Caribbean quality, and the soundtrack shows the influence of contemporary R&B; and hip hop music; Yuzo Koshiro said that he was influenced by black music, which was growing together with house and techno, so he \\"naturally began to think about taking them all in.\\" He was particularly influenced by \\"the swinging rhythms that characterized breakbeats,\\" especially the \\"ground beat\\" (used in Soul II Soul's \\"Keep On Movin'\\" in 1988 and Enigma's \\"Sadeness (Part I)\\" in 1989) which inspired \\"The Street of Rage\\" title track. Other artists who influenced him include Black Box, Maxi Priest and Caron Wheeler around the time of composing. The soundtracks for the Streets of Rage series were composed using then outdated PC-88 hardware alongside Koshiro's own original audio programming language. According to Koshiro: \\"For Bare Knuckle I used the PC88 and an original programming language I developed myself. The original was called MML, Music Macro Language. It's based on NEC's BASIC program, but I modified it heavily. It was more a BASIC-style language at first, but I modified it to be something more like Assembly. I called it ‚ÄòMusic Love'. I used it for all the Bare Knuckle Games.\\" Reprinted from The soundtrack versions of the tracks use the NEC PC-88's Sound Board II (Yamaha YM2608) sound chip rather than the Sega Mega Drive's Yamaha YM2612 chip. He said the most important element in recreating club music sounds for the games was to emulate the timbre and percussion sounds of Roland's rhythm machines (the most famous models being the TR-606, TR-707, TR-808, and TR-909), stating that \\"it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that that sound defined the genre.\\" In order to achieve this, he used the YM2612 sound chip's 8-bit PCM channel in conjunction with the other FM synthesis channels, with the Roland TR-909's kick and snare sounds sampled by the PCM, while the FM synth replicated the metallic sounds, hi-hat, and cymbal. He also replicated other percussion sounds such as the conga using detailed FM synth and MML programming. Beyond percussion, he also simulated the \\"unique, piercing\\" sounds of the Roland TB-303, an analog synthesizer that remains the most widely used bass synthesizer in club music (particularly acid and psychedelic music). He stated that it took \\"a good deal of painstaking work to recreate the sound of analog synths on FM synth, which lacks filter circuits, but I accomplished it using the same programming techniques as with the rhythm section.\\" GamesRadar considers the soundtracks to have some of the best video game music ever composed. Streets of Rage 2 The soundtrack for 1992 video game Streets of Rage 2 was released in the United States. The tracks on this soundtrack are identical to the Japanese CD soundtrack known as Bare Knuckle II. It was mostly composed and played by Yuzo Koshiro, with a few tracks also composed by Motohiro Kawashima. The soundtrack is said to be one of Koshiro's greatest and it shows the power of the 16-bit Mega Drive/Genesis's YM2612 sound chip. The music was described by Koshiro as \\"hard-core techno.\\" The game has also been noted as one of the first video games where the composer's name, Yuzo Koshiro, appears on the title screen. The soundtrack was influenced by electronic dance music, specifically house, techno, hardcore techno, progressive techno, breakbeat,Streets of Rage 2 on Discogs: * * funk, and ethnic music. Koshiro also attempted to reproduce the Roland TR-808 and TR-909 beats and Roland TB-303 synths using FM synthesis.http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2014/09/yuzo-koshiro-interview The soundtrack for Streets of Rage 2 (1992) is considered \\"revolutionary\\" and ahead of its time, for its \\"blend of swaggering house synths,\\" \\"dirty\\" electro-funk and \\"trancey electronic textures that would feel as comfortable in a nightclub as a video game.\\" Square Enix Music Online praised the soundtrack for having \\"some of the baddest beats ever to grace a video game soundtrack\\" and its creative use of the Mega Drive/Genesis's limited sound chip, such as \\"panning in the left and right speakers\\" to keep \\"the melodic material briskly moving forward\\" in the first stage \\"Go Straight\\" track. \\"In the Bar\\" has been described as \\"dreamy\\" blues-influenced piece with \\"a briskly walking bassline\\" and \\"a semi-improvisational feel that adds a jazz mystique.\\" The boss theme \\"Never Return Alive\\" is described as an \\"insane piece\\" where the \\"saw wave drills into your mind and serves as a nice syncopative measure to keep the edgy nature of the musical material intact throughout the piece's duration.\\" The second stage \\"Spin on the Bridge\\" track, described as \\"hip hop on crack,\\" has been praised for its \\"absolutely wicked breakbeats!\\" \\"Dreamer\\" has been described as a \\"dream-like\\" track with electronica arpeggiations, ethereal tones, and trance elements. \\"Alien Power\\" has been described as trip hop with \\"a bit of ethnic drum percussion,\\" giving it a \\"strange and a bit creepy\\" feel. \\"Slow Moon\\" has been praised for its funk and call-and-response elements. \\"Jungle Base\\" has been described as a hard-hitting dance song. Another stand-out track is the seventh stage \\"Expander\\" theme, which was composed by Motohiro Kawashima and has been praised as a hard-hitting track with \\"raunchy synth bass, panning synths,\\" and fast tempo. \\"Too Deep\\" has been described as an ambient track, though with sound effects that \\"sound like a ringing phone.\\" When originally reviewing the game, MegaTech gave the sound a score of 98%, and said it was \\"the best music you've ever heard on the Megadrive.\\"Streets of Rage II review, MegaTech magazine, EMAP, issue 13, January 1993 Streets of Rage 3 The music style of Streets of Rage 3 has a different feel to that of the first two games. Described by Yuzo Koshiro as \\"fast-beat techno like jungle,\\" it was composed using his own \\"Automated Composing System,\\" used to produce heavily randomized sequences. The soundtrack also had elements of abstract, experimental, gabber, and trance music. As with Streets of Rage 2, the soundtrack features tracks composed by both Koshiro and Motohiro Kawashima. Unlike the first two soundtracks, the tracks are not in the order that they appear in-game. The full title of this CD is Bare Knuckle 3: Iron Fist Scriptures. The disc itself is difficult to find today. For the soundtrack to Streets of Rage 3, Koshiro created a new composition method called the \\"Automated Composing System\\" to produce \\"fast- beat techno like jungle.\\" It was the most advanced techno technique of the time, incorporating heavily randomized sequences. This resulted in innovative and experimental sounds generated automatically that, according to Koshiro, \\"you ordinarily never could imagine on your own.\\" This method was very rare at the time, but has since become popular among techno and trance producers to get \\"unexpected and odd sounds.\\" The game's experimental, abrasive noise- based, electronic music received a mixed reception upon release, but has since been considered to be ahead of its time. According to Mean Machines, the \\"music takes some getting used to ‚Äì ironically it pre-dated the 'trance' era that came a short while after release.\\" The experimental sounds and use of heavily randomized sequences are also considered ahead of its time. Streets of Rage 4 Streets of Rage 4, developed by Dotemu, Lizardcube, and Guard Crush Games, was composed by Olivier Deriviere, with additional compositions from Yuzo Koshiro, Motohiro Kawashima, Yoko Shimomura, Keiji Yamagishi, Harumi Fujita, Das M√∂rtal, and Groundislava. The soundtrack is structured so that Deriviere wrote the primary themes, while each boss fight's theme was written by one of the guest composers. Koshiro was not a part of the project from the start, but joined in June 2019 after playing a demo of the game at BitSummit, an indie game showcase in Japan. He cited fan requests and how the game was coming along as reasons for joining. Hideki Naganuma was also originally set to contribute, but dropped out of the project due to scheduling conflicts before being replaced by Fujita. The soundtrack was released digitally alongside the game's release on April 30, 2020 by Brave Wave Productions.http://www.bravewave.net/streetsofrage4/ost A limited vinyl disc print was also released by Limited Run Games.https://limitedrungames.com/products/streets-of-rage-4-signed- soundtrack-vinyl References Category:Streets of Rage Category:Video game soundtracks Category:Video game music discographies ","title":"Music of the Streets of Rage series"},{"id":"5656068","text":"\\"Southampton Dock\\" is a song from Pink Floyd's 1983 album, The Final Cut.

It lies roughly 23 km east of Munich on the northern edge of the Upper Bavarian district of Ebersberg. Neighbouring communities are Anzing, Forstinning, Pliening and Poing, (all in Ebersberg district) as well as Finsing, Ottenhofen and Pastetten (all in Erding district). Geography Through the town flows the Hennigbach, into which empties the Gigginger Bach southwest of Markt Schwaben. The River Sempt flows by to the east. The highest point in town is in the Wittelsbacher H√∂he (heights) on the town's southern outskirts, which forms part of an alpine terminal moraine. Also in the south is the sport centre with its bathing pond. North of the railway tracks lie the Burgerfeld new town with its theatre hall, more housing estates and several commercial-industrial areas. The castle with the town hall, the marketplace and St. Margaret's Church are downtown, and the school centre somewhat southwest of there. Coat of arms and flag Coat of arms from Munich archive Markt Schwaben's arms might heraldically be described thus: In gules upon a three-knolled hill sable a falcon with wings outstretched argent armed Or. The official blazon in German, however (In Rot auf schwarzem Dreiberg ein golden bewehrter silberner Falke), makes no mention of how the falcon's beak and tongue are to be coloured (\\"bewehrter\\" refers to the claws), and indeed, two variant coats of arms are in use. In one version, both are golden, and in the other, both are white. There is no official word as to which is right. The flag bears a red and a white stripe with the coat of arms. In 1409, Duke Stephan III of Bavaria-Ingolstadt granted the town the arms of the former County of Falkenberg, which had fallen back to the Dukes of the Wittelsbachers as liege lords about 1272 after the Counts of Falkenberg had died out, thus making their arms \\"free\\" to be given out again as the new owners deemed fit. History The old Markt Schwaben castle's remaining wing, nowadays part of the Town Hall Markt Schwaben's history can be traced back to the 11th century. From this time comes a document witnessing the granting of a mill among the Swabians. The town gets its name from the settlers who came from the Alemannic region of Swabia. First, the town of Schwaben found itself in the ownership of the Count of Ebersberg. It was then later owned by the Count of Limburg/Wasserburg and eventually the Lords of Neuburg-Falkenstein, finally passing to the Wittelsbachers. In 1283, Duke Ludwig the Strict of Upper Bavaria built a castle on a rise, as in those days, the old border between Upper and Lower Bavaria ran just behind Markt Schwaben to the northeast. The strategically well placed castle was destroyed many times, being built anew each time until in 1650 there arose on the spot a great, four-winged castle, whose south wing, made over in the neo-Gothic style in 1908, is still maintained today in the middle of town. The rest of the castle was torn down in 1812 (east and north wings together with the St. Magdalenenkapelle and the \\"bridgehouse\\") and 1969 (west wing and southwest corner) owing to decaying building materials and reasons of cost. The community acquired the property in 1967 and incorporated it into a new community centre and town hall. The castle's former moat can still be made out in the south and west. In 1340, Markt Schwaben was granted market rights by Duke Rudolf. Through this and village status the town blossomed further and eventually boasted a state court seat ‚Äì at the Electoral palace. In 1805, the last \\"blood court\\" sentence was imposed, as a result of which two murderers from Grafing were beheaded in the Galgenh√∂lzl. In 1811, the court was moved to Ebersberg, leaving the town to suffer for a long time under the threat of sinking into insignificance. After the Second World War came a great inflow of Germans driven from their lands in the east, some of whom settled in Markt Schwaben. This is recalled by some street names in the town's southwest, such as K√∂nigsberger Stra√üe, Neusatzer Stra√üe and √ñdenburger Stra√üe. At this time, the population mostly drew together and worked to provide the market and the outlying villages with products. Many streets were named after these industrious citizens, such as Wei√ügerberweg (\\"Tawer Way\\"), Kupferschmiedberg (\\"Coppersmith Hill\\") and Nagelschmiedgasse (\\"Nailsmith Lane\\"). Since the community decided in 1922 to include the designation Markt in its name, the town‚Äôs official name is Markt Markt Schwaben. Under the Bavarian government lead by Wilhelm Hoegner, a number of market towns were raised to city status, among them Grafing and Ebersberg but the word \\"Markt\\" in the town's name at that time thwarted the community's efforts to be raised to city status. In the 1960s, as everywhere else in the Munich suburban area, a building boom happened in Markt Schwaben, leading to two highrise developments in the town (von-Kobell-Stra√üe and Dr. Hartlaubring). Postcards from the time describe the community as a \\"residential area in east Munich\\". Connection to the Munich local transport network (MVV) for the Olympics in 1972 afforded the town something of a boom, as there now was a quick route into the city in addition to the regional service. In 1990, the Autobahn interchange was finished. In 1992 and 1993, the Sportpark with the bathing pond was built in the southeast of the town as an addition to and partial replacement for the older sports area close to the schools. Religion In Markt Schwaben stand a Catholic church and an Evangelical Lutheran church. Moreover, the League of Free Evangelical Communities in Germany is also present, and there is a Turkish mosque. In 1315 there was a Romanesque church in Schwaben built out of brick. In 1474 a small Gothic church was consecrated. It was already known as Saint Margaret's at that time. In 1671, building work was begun on the new Pfarrkirche St. Margaret (Saint Margaret‚Äôs Parish Church) 20 metres southeast of its forerunner. The work took ten years. The first set of bells consisted of three new (in 1684) ones and one other taken from the old church (1585). In 1704, the Rosenkranzbruderschaft ‚Äì the \\"Rosary Brotherhood\\", a lay Dominican order ‚Äì endowed the Marienaltar (\\"Mary's Altar\\"). In 1718 the Jungfrauenaltar (\\"Virgins' Altar\\", with Saints Agatha, Barbara and Catharine), the Josefialtar (\\"Joseph's Altar\\") and the Antoniusaltar (\\"Anthony's Altar\\") were built. The brewer Trappentreu had the high altar installed in 1723 with a new top and tabernacle, all richly gilt. In 1862 the church was renovated, at which time the original high altarpiece was removed. Its whereabouts remain unknown to this day. In 1873 a new organ was built. The country couple Hundseder endowed a complete new set of bronze bells in 1911, poured at the bellworks in Erding with the \\"Salve Regina\\" motif in the arrangement D - F# - A - B. While the church managed to keep its bells in the First World War, in 1942 they were seized and melted down for war requirements. In 1948 the parish church received a substitute set of bells poured from steel in Bochum, with the same tonal arrangement as the old ones, which is still in use today. In 1975 came yet another, quite extravagant, restoration, whereby the church's south side, facing Erdinger Stra√üe, had to be deeply underpinned owing to the vibration from traffic. In the mid-1990s, the church tower was threatening to tear away from the nave. A woodworm infestation was successfully dealt with in 1999. As of 2015 a further expensive restoration is expected as the stuccoed vault is showing threatening cracks apparently caused by bell vibrations. On 22 May 1955, the Evangelical Philippuskirche with its vicarage was consecrated in the town's northeast. In 1962, the parish vicariate became a parish in its own right. In 1967, the church received an organ. In 1976, another community centre was added to the church. In 2005 the church was renovated.

The second and third mayors are Bernd Romir (Freie W√§hler) and Albert Hones (CSU, since 2008) respectively. Winter resigned preterm on 1 March 2011. In the elections for a new mayor on 13 March 2011, Georg Hohmann (SPD) was elected. He was re-elected again on 16 March 2014. As of 2014, 24 members (in addition to the mayors) belong to the market town's council, of whom 8 are CSU members, 6 SPD, 5 Freie W√§hler, 3 Greens and 2 members of the factionless voter's association \\"Zukunft Markt Schwaben\\" (ZSM) (\\"Future Markt Schwaben\\"). Twin towns * Ostra, Italy, since 25 October 2003 Economy =Transport= Footbridge over railways Markt Schwaben is well connected by way of transport. The railway line from Munich to M√ºhldorf carries both regional and S-Bahn trains (line S2 of the Munich Transport and Tariff Association) to Markt Schwaben. The S-Bahn can reach Munich's East Railway Station (Ostbahnhof) in about 20 minutes and Marienplatz in about 30. In the morning rush hour, the S-Bahn runs express trains at 20-minute intervals that between Markt Schwaben and the East Railway Station only stop at Riem. These trains are supposed to lighten the regular S-Bahn trains' load, since according to Deutsche Bahn, 10-minute intervals, commonplace on other S-Bahn lines during rush hour, cannot be introduced on this line. The express S-Bahn service is still undergoing testing. Thus far, the dearth of signage and the danger for passengers on the platforms when express trains pass by without stopping have been being criticized. Also, the regular S-Bahn trains have been shortened by a few coaches, which despite the lighter passenger loads are still overfull. By way of Bundesautobahn 94 from Munich to Passau, completed through to the Forstinning interchange in 1990, drivers can reach the expressway junction M√ºnchen-Ost (Munich-East, to Salzburg, Nuremberg and Stuttgart) and Munich city limits in the east. Coming from the east, the interchange for Markt Schwaben is the one at Forstinning, and coming from the west it is Anzing. With the completion of the Flughafentangente Ost, a relief road which is to connect the Autobahn with Munich Airport, some relief from through traffic was achieved. =Established businesses= The large commercial-industrial area in the town‚Äôs northwest is home to several big firms, among them the specialized wholesale business Wilhelm Gienger and the head office of the firm Seidenader, which builds machines for the pharmaceutical industry. In the south on Ebersberger Stra√üe is the Schweiger private brewery with its attached brewery inn. The market town moreover has at its disposal a post office, three filling stations, three banks and five supermarkets. A further supermarket is planned for Erdinger Stra√üe. There are also many inns, craft businesses and retail shops. Public institutions =State institutions= In 2006 the scientific department of the Zolltechnischen Pr√ºfungs- und Lehranstalt (ZPLA ‚Äì Customs-Technical Examination and Teaching Institution) was established in Markt Schwaben. This is an authority of the Bundeszollverwaltung (Federal Customs Administration). =Educational institutions= Markt Schwaben has four schools: * Grundschule Markt Schwaben (elementary school, built 1978) * Volksschule Markt Schwaben (built 1971 with extensions to 1972) * Lena Christ Realschule (built 1973/74) * Franz-Marc-Gymnasium (built 1973) =Offices= Municipal offices are found at the town hall. =Sport and leisure= Sporting facilities: * Sport centre with: grass playing field, running tracks, two training squares (one grass, one artificial turf), exercise and gymnastic field, tennis court, summer \\"stock\\" rinks, four bowling alleys, bathing pond and sporting inn. * Jahnsportplatz with all-weather square and playing field * BSG-Sportplatz with playing field and pitching place * Ausweichsportplatz * Tennis court on Hauser Weg (clubhouse burnt down in December 2005) * Indoor swimming pool with sauna and solarium Culture and sightseeing =Theatre= Weiherspiele Markt Schwaben The Weiherspiele Markt Schwaben (\\"Markt Schwaben Pond Plays\\"), an open-air theatre, was founded in 1984 by amateur theatre enthusiasts. Another very active theatre group is the Junge B√ºhne Markt Schwaben (\\"Young Stage\\"), which has its origins in the Theater im Burgerfeld. It is a theatre group for young people between 15 and 25 founded in 2003. =Museum= On Bahnhofsstra√üe is found the Heimatmuseum Markt Schwabens (\\"Markt Schwaben Local Museum\\") which houses exhibits from the Stone Age up to the present, and has on hand two scale models of the castle and the later Electoral palace. =Buildings= The Pritzl-Haus Onto the still maintained wing of the old castle has been built the town hall's modern brick building. Rather striking is the old watertower across the street with its merlons, which despite its appearance does not date from the Middle Ages. Also worthy of mention is the Pritzl-Haus with its rare roof construction and tower with cupola. Dating from 1890, it once housed a bakery. Some of the more than 30 rooms are no bigger than a closet. Furthermore, the Haydn-Villa is worth seeing. The town's oldest building, the Unterbr√§u, was thoroughly renovated in 2006. Its history stretches back before the Thirty Years' War. Here, among other things, are a great event hall and space for Markt Schwaben‚Äôs lively club life. The Mariahilf-Kapelle built in 1720 on Gerstlacher Weg now once more, after a lavish renovation that included the grounds, has its old glamour. =Regular events= Known throughout the district and far beyond are the Schwabener Sonntagsbegegnungen ‚Äì the Swabian Sunday Meetings. Guests at these dialogues between high-profile personalities, held several times a year since 1994, have included among others Johannes Rau, Joschka Fischer, Rita S√º√ümuth, Kurt Beck, Gerhard Polt, Alois Gl√ºck, Gesine Schwan, former Polish prime minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Abbot Primate Notker Wolf and Turkish Family Minister G√ºldal Aksit. The event is commonly attended by several hundred listeners. The host is Hans-Jochen Vogel. As well, the Schweiger private brewery has since 1998 set itself the goal of holding a Brauereifest (\\"Brewery Festival\\") every other year in late summer over a long weekend, with a traditional-cultural social programme, as an alternative to the folk festival observed yearly since 1994. Other Panorama view Every year, storks breed in Markt Schwaben on the old schoolhouse's roof next to the Hauptschule on Gerstlacher Weg. The great birds can often be seen standing on roofs, flying over the town or seeking food on the River Hennigbach. The stork has become a symbol for Markt Schwaben. There is a webcam trained on the storks' nest, whereby the brood may be observed over the Internet. =Curiosity= Supposedly, Markt Schwaben's Catholics have, since the end of building work on St. Margaret's Parish Church, been praying in the \\"wrong\\" church, for a local tale has it that architect Georg Zwerger's building plans for the church in Markt Schwaben and the one in Anzing somehow became transposed with each other. A key indication that the story might be true is that the Marienkirche in Anzing had always been foreseen as a pilgrimage church. Such churches as a general rule always have two great portals so that pilgrims may enter through one and leave through the other over on the other side. The church in Markt Schwaben is built like this, but the pilgrimage church in Anzing on the other hand has only one great door.

Alive, specimens typically stood about tall at the shoulder, weighed about and would have superficially resembled a modern elephant with spiral-shaped tusks.  Taxonomy  Molar tooth of Cuvieronius The species now known as Cuvieronius hyodon was among the first fossil animals from the New World to be studied. The first remains of this species were recovered from Ecuador by Alexander von Humboldt, at a location the local population referred to as the \\"Field of Giants\\".Mayor, A. (2005). Fossil legends of the first Americans. Princeton University Press. Humboldt recognized that, rather than being bones of giant humans as had been thought by the local population and previous Spanish colonists, they were similar to the giant elephants (Mastodon) being described from Ohio. Humboldt sent teeth that he had collected from Mexico, Ecuador, and Chile to French anatomist Georges Cuvier, who classified the teeth into two species, which he referred to as the \\"mastodonte des cordili√®res\\" and the \\"mastodonte humboldtien\\", in an 1806 paper.Lucas, S.G. (2009). Case 3479 Cuvieronius Osborn, 1923 (Mammalia, Proboscidea): Proposed conservation. Bull. Zool. Nomen, 66, 1-6. It was not until 1824 that Cuvier formally named the species. He referred both to the genus Mastodon, calling them M. andium and M. humboldtii. Unknown to Cuvier, Fischer had, in 1814, already named the two species based on Cuvier's original description, in the new genus Mastotherium as M. hyodon and M. humboldtii. The idea of two distinct species continued to be accepted into the 20th century, usually using Cuvier's names, though Fischer's names were older. In 1923, Henry Fairfield Osborn recognized that these species were distinct from Mastodon, and assigned each to its own new genus, as Cuvieronius humboldtii and Cordillerion andium. However, by the 1930s, general agreement had shifted to regard both forms as representing a single, geographically widespread species, with Cuvieronius humboldtii considered to be the correct name. During the 1950s, the nomenclature of this species became increasingly tangled, as various scientists regarded the type species of the genus Cuvieronius to be Fischer's first published name Mastotherium hyodon, rather than the originally designated Mastodon humboldtii. This situation went unaddressed until 2009, when Spencer Lucas petitioned the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature to officially change the type species of Cuvieronius to M. hyodon as had been followed for over 50 years by that time, rather than abandoning the well-known Cuvieronius as a synonym. In 2011, Opinion 2276 of the ICZN ruled to conserve the names. Cuvieronius hyodon skull in lateral view =Evolution= Cuvieronius initially evolved in North America during the Late Pliocene. It is considered closely related to, if not derived from, Rhynchotherium, a North American gomphothere genus known from the Late Miocene and Pliocene.Lucas, S.P., 2008a. Cuvieronius (Mammalia, Proboscidea) from the Neogene of Florida. In: Lucas, S.P., Morgan, G.S., Spielmann, J.A., Prothero, D.R. (Eds.), Neogene Mammals, vol. 44. N. M. Mus. Nat. Hist. Sci. Bull., pp. 31e38 Cuvieronius was expirated from most of North America during Irvingtonian after the arrival of mammoths in North America around 1.3 Ma, presumably due to competitive exclusion by mammoths and mastodons, but persisted in southern North America until the very end of the Pleistocene. During the Great American Interchange , Cuvieronius and a relative, Notiomastodon, dispersed into South America. Cuvieronius apparently reached South America considerably later than Notiomastodon, with the oldest possible date being 0.76 ¬±0.03 Mya and the oldest confirmed date being 304 ¬±54 ka, and had a much more restricted range, confined mostly to the Andes.Restoration of C. hyodon Cuvieronius remains have been identified as far south as Chile, with remains initially suggested to represent Cuvieronius at the Quereo I site (Quereo Quebrada) dating to the Late Pleistocene 11,600‚Äî11,400 BP.Paleobiology database, Collection 71265, Quereo Quebrada, Chile. Authority: John Alroy February 5, 1999. However, more recent studies suggest that they were extirpated from South America by the end of the Late Pleistocene, before the arrival of people.  Distribution and habitat  Restoration The oldest fossil remains to date are of Cuvieronius species found in Lincoln County, Nevada, which date to an accurate 4.6 million years ago (Mya). It was also found as far east as South Carolina and North Carolina in Pleistocene rocks dating to 1.81 million to 126,000 years ago. In Florida, remains show both Cuvieronius living from 2 to 0.5 Mya. The most recent findings of Cuvieronius in North America are in Sonora, Mexico, that date to 13,390 years BP at a Clovis culture kill site. As well as remains found near the town of Hockley in Texas near Austin, which date to around 24,000 years BP. According to a group of Brazilian mammalogists, many sites in South America referred to Cuvieronius actually refer to Notiomastodon, with many previous studies simply labeling fossils one or the other depending on location, with only localities definitely identified as Cuvieronius, the range now extends in the high Andes from Ecuador in the north, to Bolivia in the south, with the localities in the southern Andes in Chile and Argentina now thought to belong to Notiomastodon. The same group maintains that all the South American specimens represent the single species C. hyodon, and that no confirmed fossils of Cuvieronius are more recent than 44,000 years ago in South America, so the species would not have been in South America at the time of human arrival. By the end of the Pleistocene, the northern limit of the range of Cuvieronius was in Mexico and Central Texas. Fossils of Cuvieronius have been found in the Ulloma and Tarija Formations of Bolivia, the Sabana Formation of Colombia,Correal Urrego, 1990, p.77 Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, United States (Florida, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas), and Venezuela.Cuvieronius at Fossilworks.org An account has Cuvieronius remains being found in Ecuador with human artifacts dated around 200 to 400 AD.D.

It is about north-northwest of the Ghost Ranch. Legend Sandstone cliffs near the Echo Amphitheater In the spring of 1861, a group of settlers from Iowa were farming in northern New Mexico when they were set upon by a band of Navajo who had ventured into the region. The settlers (one family was the Zendalters and another family was the Treblers) were taken to the top of the amphitheater and executed. Their blood spilled into the amphitheater, staining its walls. Three years later, when the Navajo were being forced on the \\"Long Walk\\" to Bosque Redondo by the U.S. Army, ten Navajo men were killed at the top of the amphitheater in retribution for the earlier deaths. Once again, blood spilled down the walls of the amphitheater. The blood seeped into the pores of the rock and dried and supposedly is still visible today. It is said that in the echoes returned from the cliff's walls one can hear the anguished cries of the dead. Protest Rock face and desert varnish in the Echo Amphitheater In October 1966, the Alianza Federal de Mercedes, an organization dedicated to the restoration of certain land grants entrenched in the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo to descendants of then- Mexican citizens, occupied Echo Amphitheater in an attempt to create a land grant community.

It was the result of a recording session in early 1969 at Chess Records in Chicago (home to Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, et al.) with Fleetwood Mac, then a young British blues band, and a number of famous Chicago blues artists from whom they drew inspiration. The album has also been released, with slightly different track listings, under the titles Blues Jam at Chess and Blues Jam in Chicago Volumes One and Two. The members of Fleetwood Mac at the time of this recording were Peter Green, Jeremy Spencer, Danny Kirwan, Mick Fleetwood, and John McVie. The Chicago blues musicians who played at this session were Otis Spann (piano, vocals), Willie Dixon (upright bass), Shakey Horton (harmonica, vocals), J.T. Brown (tenor saxophone, vocals), Buddy Guy (guitar), Honeyboy Edwards (guitar, vocals), and S.P. Leary (drums). Critical reception Writing in Rolling Stone in 1976, Greil Marcus said, \\"Thanks to the near-permanent success of the current Fleetwood Mac LP, virtually all the band's pre-Warner Bros. material ‚Äì featuring guitarists Peter Green, Danny Kirwan and Jeremy Spencer ‚Äì is back on the market. The best stuff is to be found on Fleetwood Mac in Chicago (Sire), a double album cut in '69 at the Chess studios, with real-life black bluesmen sitting in.... The Fleetwood Mac that cut this album was a rough, derivative band, full of enthusiasm and committed to their music... The shade of Elmore James smiled on the band, and never more so than on Chicago...\\" AllMusic said, \\"Put together on short notice, and recorded in one day, the sessions have something of a ramshackle feel, but the energy of the performances transcends any shortcomings on this date....\\" \\"Given that the Peter Green-led Fleetwood Mac was already deeply rooted in Chicago blues, the project proved to be a natural for the group...\\" Robert Christgau wrote, \\"Knowledgeable song selection, expressive playing ‚Äì especially by Peter Green, who filters B.B.

T. Edwards Hospital in Tallahassee, FL; 1960 Sunland Hospital refers to a chain of defunct mental health facilities located throughout the state of Florida. Originally named the W. T. Edwards Tuberculosis Hospitals, the facilities were later remodeled into \\"Sunland Centers\\" with services for the mentally and physically disabled, specializing mostly in children. A large majority of the centers were shut down by 1983 for various health and safety reasons.  W. T. Edwards Tuberculosis Hospital  W.T. Edwards was the first chairman of the State Tuberculosis Board.About Sunland Center at Marianna, Agency for Persons with Disabilities When a new series of state-of-the-art tuberculosis hospitals opened in roughly 1952, they were named in honor of him. The hospitals were located all over the state of Florida, including Tampa, Lantana, Marianna, Tallahassee, Miami and several other cities in south Florida. All of the hospital buildings were constructed in the same basic way. The main buildings were all very long and thin, consisting of 5 floors with a few smaller wings branching off from the main building. At the time, it was thought that fresh air was the best treatment for TB, so the buildings were riddled with multi-pane windows which could be opened by cranks. The back side of each building was a wall of windows, while the front windows were more evenly spaced apart, especially in sections that did not house patients. When antibiotics effective against TB were developed, there was no longer a need for tuberculosis hospitals and the W. T. Edwards Hospitals were all closed by the start of the 1960s. The facilities fell under the jurisdiction of the Florida Department of Health and it wouldn't take long for the hospitals to reopen as Sunlands across the state.\\"tuberculosis Hospital Named Mental Center\\", St. Petersburg Times, December 7, 1966  Sunland Training Centers  In 1961 the Division of Sunland Training Centers was established on the Board of Commissioners for Institutions and replaced the Division of Farm Colonies in Florida. Many former W. T. Edwards Hospitals were remodeled and reopened as Sunland Mental Hospitals. The main Sunland building, located in Orlando, was the only one not housed in a former Edwards hospital. W. T. Edwards Hospital in Tampa, FL; November 2006 At first the Centers did well, but soon they were plagued with problems, mostly due to understaffing and underfunding. The most infamous facility for patient neglect was the Sunland located in Tallahassee, which not only suffered from severe staff shortages, but also significant deterioration of the physical plant itself.\\"Sunland Center Sanitation, Food Protested\\", St. Petersburg Times, March 11, 1967. Page 2-B. Many Sunlands had various activities for the patients, who were mostly children, to engage in. There were swimming pools with rails and plastic wheelchairs, hopscotch, shuffleboard and frequent appearances by figures like Woodsy Owl and even the state governor himself. Many of the patients were also official Boy Scouts and often held meetings on the hospital grounds with Scoutmasters. Pictures still exist in the Florida archives of children in full uniform posing in their wheelchairs and hospital beds. As the state of the hospitals declined, they fell under the Florida Department of Children and Families and underwent several name changes. Eventually, groups like the Association for Retarded Citizens stepped in and began speaking out against institutions like Sunland, which often treated its patients as \\"sub-human\\", subjecting them to a variety of treatments that were considered cruel. As the 1970s came to an end, it soon became obvious that Sunland would not survive. Most of the centers closed down by 1980 and dispersed their patients to foster homes.  Sunland Center at Tallahassee  Sunland at Tallahassee as it stood in June 2006 The Sunland Center at Tallahassee received its first 10 residents from the Orlando Sunland in March 1967. The Sunland Center at Tallahassee was considered a hospital because it cared for both mentally and physically disabled patients while all other centers cared for mentally disabled patients only. Within a year of the Center opening, it started to suffer from a shortage of funds and overcrowding conditions. These forces caused a variety of problems to form within the hospital from poor and inadequately prepared food, overcrowding of the cottages, inactivity of the children, unsanitary conditions, inadequacy of dental services, to unacceptable and torturous hygienic practices. Conditions within the hospital continued to worsen causing various psychologists to call for the closing of the center.\\"Psychologists Urge Closing Sunland Center\\", St. Petersburg Times, October 8, 1968 Over time, to help cover costs of various vocation and rehab programs within the state, funds were shifted away from the Sunland Centers to other programs.\\"Rehab Program Ok To July 1\\", The Evening Independent, March 6, 1971 After various scandals, lack of funds, and the move towards community care, the Sunland Center closed in 1983.Cornwell, Bill. \\"State moving Toward More Community Care For The Retarded\\", St. Petersburg Times, May 10, 1983 The property was almost purchased in 2004 by a Winter Park businessman, but that deal fell through.Ensley, Gerald. \\"Buyer backs out of $4.5 million Tallahassee, Fla., hospital deal\\", Tallahassee Democrat, December 9, 2004 Over a year later, the property was finally sold for use in a housing and commercial district project, which later became the Victoria Grand Luxury Apartments. Demolition of the hospital building and all the surrounding buildings and wooded areas started in early 2006 and was completed in November of the same year. Months later, construction began on the Victoria Grand Apartments. Today, there is no sign of Sunland at Tallahassee remaining on Phillips road. However, relics from the old hospital were said to be collected and used to create part of the Sunland Asylum wing at the Terror of Tallahassee (a local haunted attraction).  A. G. Holley Hospital  A. G. Holley State Hospital (AGH) was opened in 1950 as the Southeast Florida Tuberculosis Hospital. It was originally built to serve 500 patients, with living accommodations for the physicians, nurses and administrative staff. It was the second of four state tuberculosis hospitals built in Florida between 1938 and 1952. The other hospitals have since closed. A. G. Holley was the last of the original American sanatoriums that continued to be dedicated to tuberculosis. With the discovery of drugs to treat tuberculosis patients outside of the hospital setting, the daily census at the hospital by 1971 dropped to less than half of the original 500. By 1976 the beds and staff at A. G. Holley were reduced to serve a maximum of 150 patients. As space became available, other agencies were invited to move onto the complex to utilize the unique environment. Tuberculosis in the United States and especially in Florida began to increase in the mid '80s. This was due to the emergence of HIV, an increase in homelessness, drug addiction, immigration from areas of high tuberculosis, the spread in institutional settings, and the spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis. As the incidence of TB declined, so did the number of beds. Although the hospital was licensed for 100 beds, it was only funded for 50. As the rate of tuberculosis continued to decline, the Florida Legislature felt it was no longer cost effective to run the hospital at a deficit of $10 million per year. Similar outcomes are expected by treating patients at home or in local acute care settings. The Florida legislature mandated in the 2012 session that the hospital close its doors by January 1, 2013. The Department of Health accelerated the closure by six months and the hospital closed July 2, 2012. Demolition of the main building began on November 18, 2014.

It is on the river Neckar, southwest of Heilbronn. The town is famous as the birthplace of the poet Friedrich H√∂lderlin and for its quality wines ‚Äì in particular the \\"Lauffener Katzenbei√üer Schwarzriesling\\".  Geography  Lauffen is located in the southern part of the district of Heilbronn, south of Heilbronn and north of the capital of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Stuttgart, on the Neckar. The small river Zaber flows into the Neckar at this point. The neck of the previous great bow in the course of the north-flowing Neckar was broken through by erosion somewhere between 400 BC and 100 BC and for several centuries the watercourse survived as a ring of lakes. The old circular riverbed is now dry, apart from one small artificial lake. Along the old riverbed, a round hill was formed ‚Äì its slopes now partially covered by the Kaywald forest and with other areas given over to the cultivation of vines. There is a hill on the western bank of the Neckar at the centre point of the ancient river bow. This hill became separated from another on the present eastern bank when the river broke through. Lauffen grew up on the western bank, on the ridge which is the site of today's Regiswindis Church. This hill settlement became known as Lauffen-Dorf (Lauffen village). In the middle of the river, between the two hills, is an island with a castle. This castle, originally the seat of the Earls of Lauffen, is now home to the town hall ‚Äì the island itself is a nature reserve. Another settlement, Lauffen-Stadt (Lauffen town), later established itself on the hill on the eastern bank. The two districts, Lauffen-Dorf and Lauffen-Stadt, are joined by a bridge. A smaller bridge from Lauffen-Stadt leads to the island and the town hall. Yet another district, the so-called Lauffen-D√∂rfle (Lauffen little village), grew up around a convent and is situated on the western bank to the north of Lauffen-Dorf and the Zaber. An exclave of Lauffen, the town's forest of Etzlenswenden, is located further east in the L√∂wenstein Mountains. It is presumed that this forested area was allocated to the town by its founders in around AD 1200, as there was no other forest within its boundaries from which timber and firewood could be obtained. It is here, in the exclave, that the highest point is situated above sea level; the lowest point above sea level is by the Neckar.Das Land Baden-W√ºrttemberg.

S. 1‚Äì16 = Neighbouring municipalities = Neighbouring towns and villages of Lauffen are (clockwise from the west): Brackenheim, Nordheim, Heilbronn, Talheim, Isfeld, Neckarwestheim and Kirchheim am Neckar (District of Ludwigsburg). The exclave Stadtwald Etzlenswenden is surrounded (from the west) by Abstatt, Untergruppenbach, L√∂wenstein and Beilstein. All neighbouring villages as far as Heilbronn and Kircheim come under the Landkreis (district) Heilbronn. Lauffen has combined with Neckarwestheim and Nordheim to form a joint association of administrations. = Town structure = The localities of Lauffen-Stadt (town) and Lauffen-Dorf (village) were combined on 1 April 1914 to create today's Lauffen am Neckar. The outlying farmsteads of the Landturm, an old customs house on the former W√ºrttemberg boundary, are included as part of the town. The defunct hamlets of Osterhofen and Talhofen originally lay within its bounds.  History  =First settlement and origin of place name= Villa rustica in Lauffen It is presumed that the area around Lauffen had already been settled in pre-Christian times, although the only evidence consists of a few bones. The settlement's high level of frequentation can be attributed to the shallow water between the present old Neckar bridge and the cliffs by the castle and Regiswindis Church. Here the river was fordable for most of the year and the spot used by both men and animals as a crossing point. Such opportunities were few and far between along this stretch of the original Neckar. Indeed, the nearest fords were some kilometres distant. The two prominent cliffs may well have served as lookouts and refuges since primeval times. The foundations of a Roman estate (Villa Rustica) dating from between the 2nd and 3rd centuries, along with coins and pottery, were discovered some two kilometres () to the southeast of the present town centre.:de:Villa rustica (Lauffen) Villa rustica (Lauffen) (German: accessed 3 October 2007) Archaeological excavations show that the Alemannians came to the area in around 260 AD upon the departure of the Romans. With the arrival of the Franks in 500 AD, a royal estate was founded together with a church dedicated to St Martin. The ownership of the estate alternated frequently between princes and church. A document from 823 refers to this ‚Äúchurch in the tribal district of Neckar which is dedicated to Saint Martin in the Villa Hlauppa.‚Äù The name \\"Hlauppa\\" (which has become \\"Lauffen\\") is characteristic of places with rapids or waterfalls. Other examples of this derivation are Laufen and Laufenburg.:de:Stromschnelle Origin of Place Name (German: accessed 5 October 2007) The rapids which are occasionally visible at Lauffen were created by erosion when the Neckar shortened its course after breaking through the neck of a great bow ‚Äì an event which is estimated to have taken place between 400 BC and 100 BC Painting in the Regiswindis Church depicting emperor Ludwig granting margrave Ernst the fiefdom of Lauffen in 832 =9th century to 11th century= In 832 Emperor Ludwig Louis the Pious granted the then unfortified village to his son-in-law Ernst, the margrave of Nordgau in the Upper Palatinate, on condition that the inhospitable place be suitably developed ‚Äì it was the property of the Emperor, who intended to use it for hunting. The initial cultivation of the Neckar slopes and the first castle can be traced back to Ernst. According to legend, the Graf's infant daughter, Regiswindis, was murdered by her wet nurse and the body thrown into the Neckar.:de:Regiswindis Regiswindis (German: accessed 3 October 2007) After this incident, the margrave Ernst returned to his home in the Upper Palatinate and the village was transferred back to the emperor with effect from 861, before the expiration of the lease and the death of the Graf. In 889, 923 and 993, various German emperors transferred their rule over the village to the Bishopric of W√ºrzburg. In 1003, Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor called for the establishment of a convent in the village, which had meanwhile been fortified. A Benedictine convent was accordingly set up under the auspices of Bishop Heinrich von W√ºrzburg. =High Middle Ages= The end of the 11th century saw the arrival of the Gaugrafen von Lauffen (Frankish earls):de:Grafen von Lauffen Earls of Lauffen (German: accessed 7 October 2007) who were allied to the Bishopric of Worms and noble descendants of the Poppon tribe of Lauffen. They pressed ahead with the fortification of the settlement and of the castle. In around 1150, they had the rocks on the eastern riverbank cut back, thus creating the basis for a moated castle ‚Äì the present-day \\"Pfalzgrafenburg\\". The three brothers ‚Äì Heinrich II, Boppo V and Konrad II ‚Äì all died without male issue. With the death of the last scion in 1218 or 1219, the house of Lauffen died out, although its coat of arms survives to this day as the arms of the District of Heilbronn. In the 13th century, the town once again reverted to the German Emperor (Holy Roman Emperor). In 1227, the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II mortgaged Lauffen, Sinsheim and Eppingen to Herman V of Baden. In the mortgage deed, Lauffen was first referred to as \\"civitas\\" (town with civic institutions). The upward designation to \\"town\\" is frequently dated as having taken place in the year 1234. Lauffen first documented as town (German: accessed 3 October 2007) The Margraves of Baden administered the town through a family of bailiffs. A church was built in 1227 to replace an existing chapel and dedicated to the now canonized Saint Regiswindis. The families of the ruling aristocracy were beset with problems over complex inheritance disputes and mortgage debts. As a result, hegemony over the town changed frequently, transferring to (among others) the Dukes of Teck. In 1327, Lauffen was mortgaged to W√ºrttemberg. In 1346, Sir Albrecht (Ritter Albrecht Hofwarth) acquired town and castle from the Margraves of Baden for 3,000 heller. However, in 1361, he resold his acquisition to Graf Eberhard von W√ºrttemberg and his brother for double the purchase price. Due to the proximity of the Free Imperial City of Heilbronn, the rulers of W√ºrttemberg demanded a commitment of loyalty from the inhabitants of Lauffen. =Late Middle Ages and Peasants' War= The 15th century at Lauffen was characterized by conflicts over complex fishing and tithe rights which affected many of the inhabitants. The lake of Lauffen was created by Ulrich V, Count of W√ºrttemberg in 1454. In 1460 his troops were called upon to defend fishing and customs rights against Palatinate troops. However, the following year, the Palatinate Graf Friedrich gave an undertaking to stop attacks against various localities in W√ºrttemberg. Then, in 1469, a treaty between the Palatinate and W√ºrttemberg resolved the customs disputes over the transportation of timber along the River Murr. In 1474 the first bridge at Lauffen was built over the Neckar thus bringing the entire customs duties for river traffic to the town. The bridge was destroyed by the flood of 1529 and rebuilt in 1532. A town hall was built and a weekly market established in 1480. Two years later, the bubonic plague caused the death of 1,300 inhabitants. During the German Peasants' War, an 8,000-strong army of peasants set up camp between Lauffen and Gemmrigheim in 1525. Bowing to superior force, the town council sided with the peasants ‚Äì as a result only the convent was sacked. On 13 May 1534, at the Battle of Lauffen, the 11,000 troops of Austria were outnumbered by those of the Rulers of Hesse, whose forces consisted of some 25,000 men. As a result of the victory over the Austrians, Ulrich, Duke of W√ºrttemberg regained his territory and led his subjects towards the Reformation. Lauffen was occupied for over a year in approximately 1547 by Imperial troops during the war of the Schmalkaldic League, then reverted to W√ºrttemberg. 1564 saw the return of the bubonic plague, which claimed some 800 victims. The plague returned in 1606, 1607 and 1626 although there were fewer fatalities. =Thirty Years' War= Lauffen C 1640. Illustration by Matth√§us Merian's Topographia Germaniae During the Thirty Years' War, Lauffen was the scene of several battles and troop movements. The bridge and the nearby ford proved to be of major strategic significance. In April 1622, a large force belonging to Wilhelm, Duke of Saxe- Weimar and George Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach assembled at the bridge to engage the imperial troops. Battle was joined at Wimpfen early in May and resulted in victory for the imperial forces. After this defeat, two companies of the Margrave's troops and many Neckargartach farmers took refuge in Lauffen. The town was spared major fighting for several years, but almost 20 years of suffering were still to come. In 1629, a large force of imperial troops moved through the town, to be followed in 1631 by troops of Lorraine. In 1634, Croatian soldiers plundered Lauffen and two days later the imperial forces returned. In November the last 16 head of cattle were confiscated. At Christmas 1634, Lauffen provided winter quarters for five transiting regiments. At Whitsun 1635, the M√ºhlheimische K√ºrassier-Regiment seized the entire winter crop, thus creating a famine which claimed 800 lives. In 1636, Lauffen was sacked by a Colonel Liddaw and his regiment of cuirassiers. In the autumn of 1637, it was overrun by two different regiments ‚Äì a state of affairs which caused a shortage of food during the winter and resulted in the deaths of 200 people. In 1638, it had to endure the presence of a company of Parischen troops; then, in May and again in September, it was once more descended upon by imperial forces. In the autumn, two regiments of cavalry looted the harvest and, at the beginning of December, three cavalry regiments sacked the town. At Christmas 1638, the imperial general staff took over Lauffen. By the end of that year, the population had fallen to just 30. The misery continued during 1639 with frequent occupations by troops. The years 1640 to 1642 were comparatively quiet, but in 1643 French Weimar regiments were in occupation, along with the entire French general staff. The so-called \\"Weimar occupation\\" lasted until May 1643, when victory was achieved after three days of fighting by the Bavarian army under the command of Graf Fugger. In 1645, the town was again plundered by French and Hessian troops. Subsequently, the Bavarians moved back, but provisions were barely enough to feed them. Virtually all that remained were cabbages, beets and new wine. A year later, Swedish troops joined the Bavarians and extensive defences were constructed. After the armistice of 1647 between France and Bavaria, the town's defences were razed to the ground. The Bavarians withdrew, to be replaced over the winter by a company of Weimar cavalry. With the failure of the armistice, a French garrison arrived and set about constructing more defences, which nevertheless became redundant with the conclusion of peace in 1648. For many years after the end of the war, and at frequent intervals, Lauffen would be taken over and occupied by troops. At the end of the Thirty Years' War, the population was 155. The upper castle had been destroyed, the lower one severely damaged. The town's church was also badly damaged. In all, 270 houses were damaged and of vineyards, of fields and of meadows had been laid to waste. =The War with France= Since the political situation in the second half of the 17th century was far from stable, Eberhard III strengthened the fortifications around Lauffen with drawbridges and parapets as a defence against potential attacks by the French. Just a few years after the devastating Thirty Years' War, Lauffen was the scene of invasions for a second time. In 1674, the army of the Elector of Brandenburg crossed the Neckar on the way to Strasbourg, to be followed by the L√ºneburg-Zellsche army. Upon the withdrawal of these forces, the Brandenburgers set up their headquarters at Isfeld. In May 1675, the imperial army, arriving from The Netherlands, crossed the river near Lauffen. In 1676, the town served as winter quarters for an imperial regiment of cuirassiers and, in 1679, for a company of cavalry from Lorraine. In 1688, the French army arrived, confiscating all the horses and destroying the bridge. During the following decade, the area witnessed more hostilities and was again occupied. Yet more looting occurred, along with the destruction of agricultural land. The population, which had increased between the two wars, was later decimated to 210 persons in 1697. =18th century= Lauffen from south-east; watercolour C 1800 Lauffen, castle and Regiswindis Church from north-west; watercolour by Caspar Obach C 1850 The 18th century was also dominated by matters military. In 1704 the Anglo-Dutch cavalry crossed the Neckar at Lauffen, and in 1707, 2000 French horsemen sacked the town for a second time. 1709, a cuirassier regiment from K√ºrnbach was quartered there. However, more than 100 years after the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War, Lauffen was starting to recover from the damage which had been inflicted. In 1721, the town hall was rebuilt and in 1724 the temporarily repaired bridge dating from 1693 was converted into a covered suspension bridge. From 1728, a night watch was established in response to a spate of murders and robberies. In 1744, Lauffen was besieged by the imperial Bavarian army under Feldmarschall von Seckendorff and 1754 witnessed repeated returns of the French. There followed subsequent occupations by troops from Wimpfen and Anhalt. In 1755, the previous protectorate structure was abolished and Lauffen became an \\"Oberamt\\" (administrative area). Thirty years later, 160 inhabitants died of typhus. =19th century= The Oberamt Lauffen was wound up in 1808, and the town came under the jurisdiction of the Oberamt Besigheim. Two years later, the bridge over the Neckar was again renovated, the wooden elements being replaced by masonry. In 1817, the council bought the Neckar Island with the intention of using the site for a town hall. During the 19th century, emphasis was placed on agriculture. The lake of Lauffen was drained in 1820, thus producing of additional land. With the lake gone, the inhabitants lost a rich source of food but, on the other hand, the water had also been the cause of fevers. Wine growing was improved by abandoning unprofitable varieties. The main variety became Pinot blanc. The town planted more than 2,000 fruit trees within its boundaries and countless willows along the banks of the Neckar. Agriculture continued to increase in importance. From 2000 inhabitants in 1800, the population increased to approximately 4000 in 1850. The section of railway between Stuttgart and Heilbronn was completed in 1847, giving rise to the construction of buildings around the railway station. Following a fire on 14 October 1861, a volunteer fire brigade was formed on 19 November of the same year.History of the Lauffen Volunteer Fire Brigade (German: accessed 9 December 2007) In 1889, the second shaft of the railway tunnel (584 m) was completed between Kircheim am Neckar and Lauffen, thus removing a major bottleneck on the Franconia Railway from Heilbronn to Stuttgart. The year 1891 saw the world's first long distance transmission of alternating three-phase electric current. This important technical achievement ‚Äì a link between Lauffen and Frankfurt Main ‚Äì is described in the section 'Economy and infrastructure' below. =20th century= In 1914, two districts (Lauffen-Stadt and Lauffen-Dorf) were merged to create the new town of Lauffen am Neckar. The new town council marked the occasion by planting a lime tree in the terraced garden in front of the Pfalzgrafenburg castle. This tree stands opposite another lime at the Regiswindis Church on the other bank, the two trees thus symbolising unity. Of the soldiers who served in the First World War, 189 failed to return. A war memorial was erected in their honour in front of the town hall in 1922. This was removed in 1949 to make way for a widening of the canal, and to enable the plaque bearing the names of the fallen to be set into the wall of the old cemetery alongside another dedicated to the even greater number of victims of the Second World War. In the mid-1930s, work was started on the construction of a by-pass canal for the Neckar. This new canal had the effect of making the rocks of the Pfalzgrafenburg into an island once more. For a time, the cliff was linked to the town via a millrace which had been artificially created, and the Neckar sped in front of the cliffs and the bridge over rocks which had been placed there to produce rapids. (Pictures dating from 1640 and 1800 provide an interesting comparison.) The building of the canal was given high priority ‚Äì several houses and even the first commercial three-phase power station were demolished. The original generator is now on display at the Deutsches Museum in Munich. Nearby, the Oskar von Miller Strasse (the westerly access road to the cement works) is a reminder of the power station's previous location. Electricity has since been generated at the dam further upstream. Parallel with the construction of the canal came the laying of a narrow gauge railway for the transportation of stone along the right bank of the river between the Lauffen cement works and the quarry at Neckarwestheim. The railway ceased operation in 1984, with the rails later removed to create a new footpath and cycle way. The engine is preserved on a playground near the old bridge beside the former railway track. The quarry is now the site of the Neckarwestheim Nuclear Power Plant (GKN). Between 1935 and 1938, work took place on the so-called ‚ÄòNeckar-Enz Line‚Äô between Eberbach and Unterriexingen. This was a series of fortifications designed to resist a possible attack from the west. Eleven bunkers were constructed in the Lauffen sector, none of which had any impact on the end of the war. There are two locks at Lauffen, both upstream of the castle. The first was constructed between 1938 and 1945 ‚Äì the second between 1950 and 1951. Following boundary change legislation in 1938, the administrative area known as the Oberamt Besigheim was dissolved and Lauffen became part of the Landkreis Heilbronn (district of Heilbronn). During the Second World War the town suffered 37 air raids, this number being partly influenced by its proximity to the decoy target known as ‚ÄòBrasilien‚Äô, which was laid out to look like the main railway station at Stuttgart.:de:Brasilien (Scheinanlage) (German: accessed 7 February 2008) On 13 April 1944, an allied bomber formation was returning to base having failed to bomb its primary and secondary targets (Nuremberg and Stuttgart) when it was attacked by a German fighter and forced to jettison its load over Lauffen. The town escaped serious damage and casualties from the bombs, which were dropped at random and in some cases unprimed. Most fell in fields or the river although some dropped on the Sonnenstrasse, the Br√ºckenstrasse, the old cemetery and in the vicinity of the cement works and St Martin's Church. There were 59 fatalities including a number of forced labourers. The then mayor was criticised for not having sounded the air raid warning. Secondary targets for the bombers had been in northern W√ºrttemberg, Hesse or the Ruhr. As was so often the case, a return to base with the bomb load had not been included in the fuel calculations. The bombing of Lauffen can thus be regarded as the sacrifice of a pawn ‚Äì a sacrifice in favour of a city. On 20 June 1959, there was a serious accident at Lauffen when a public service bus operated by the Deutsche Bundesbahn crashed into an express train on the T√ºbingen-W√ºrzburg (via Stuttgart) route. At the time, this accident was the worst since the Second World War, killing 45 and seriously injuring a further 27. The cause of the accident was attributed to human error on the part of the level-crossing keeper; the level-crossing has since been replaced by an underpass. A commemorative plaque was erected in memory of those who lost their lives.This first report in the British press did not include those who later died of their injuries.  Religion  Following the Battle of Lauffen in 1534, the town became the first in W√ºrttemberg to embrace the Reformation. A reference to the first Protestant vicar, Hieronymus Hailbrunner, occurs in 1546 but he was no doubt already in office before this date. Since then, a majority of the town's worshippers has been of the Protestant faith. A Roman Catholic congregation did not exist until 1946. The Protestant congregation numbers some 6,000; there are approximately 3,000 Roman Catholics, some of whom are in Neckarwestheim. There is also a New Apostolic Church and congregation in the town.  Politics  =District council= Former castle, present town hall Following the municipal election of 7 June 2009, the district council of Lauffen has 22 seats. The election result is as follows: { style=\\"background:#aaaaaa\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" - bgcolor=\\"#f9f9f9\\"  CDUalign=right  8 Sitze align=right  (34.21%) - bgcolor=\\"#f9f9f9\\"  FW Lauffenalign=right  4 Sitze align=right  (18.67%) - bgcolor=\\"#f9f9f9\\"  FDP/DVPalign=right  4 Sitze align=right  (17.64%) - bgcolor=\\"#f9f9f9\\"  SPDalign=right  4 Sitze align=right  (17.21%) - bgcolor=\\"#f9f9f9\\"  GR√úNEalign=right  2 Sitze align=right  (12.28%) } The mayor is also a member of the district council and its chairman. =Arms and flag= Blazon: Argent a messenger vested Vert in shoes Gules, holding in his dexter hand an envelope of the field sealed of the third and in his sinister hand a spear of the same headed Azure. The town's colours are green and white. Lauffen originally bore the coat of arms of the founders of the town, the Grafen von Lauffen (the Earls of Lauffen). This was a clawless eagle (cp. the present arms of the district of Heilbronn). From 1220 to 1346, the town was a possession of Baden, and in 1311 the arms of Baden first appeared in a Lauffen seal. The present coat of arms, one of the type which alludes to its owner, was first verified in a seal for the year 1464.Heinz Bardua: Die Kreis- und Gemeindewappen im Regierungsbezirk Stuttgart.

Buildings  *Town Hall and Museum: This former castle of the Grafen (Earls) of Lauffen was built in the 11th century. Destroyed during the Thirty Years' War, it was rebuilt after 1648 as the seat of the governor. The castle's Roman keep survives. The structure has served as the town hall from 1818 and has since been subject to frequent alterations. Lauffen Town Hall (German: accessed 3 October 2007) The town's museum in the convent yard was rebuilt in 1923 from the remains of the previous convent church. It is now the home of exhibitions devoted to the history of Lauffen and Friedrich H√∂lderlin. Regiswindis Church *Regiswindis Church: The rebuilding of the church in its present form was well underway by 1567 after a fire had destroyed all but the choir three years previously. The church dates from 1227, when it was dedicated to Saint Regiswindis, but previous structures (St Martin's Church) date back to 741. Fragments of a Mount of Olives painting C 1507 by Hans Seyfer survive on the exterior of the choir. *Regiswindis Chapel. At the left of the picture can be seen one of the two lime trees on opposite sides of the River Neckar. Planted in 1914, these symbolise the unity of the town. Regiswindis Chapel: Originally a graveyard chapel dedicated to Saint Ann, its crypt served as a charnel house. In 1901, the piles of bones were collected and buried. The stone sarcophagus containing the remains of Regiswindis were transferred to the chapel in 1882, at which point the building acquired its present name. Grabengasse (moat lane)Kirchbergstra√üe *There are many historic buildings in the town centre, including dwellings in the baroque style dating from the 18th century, and those associated with the Kirchberg, which include an old bake house. The curious Grabengasse (moat lane) winds its way by the Kirchberg. This lane is part of the town's original moat which has been overbuilt with timber-framed houses. At one time it was the route for river traffic, which included even motorised craft. *The pedestrianised area known as St√§dtle is also worth a visit. This consists mainly of well-preserved 15th-century houses built in the traditional timber-framed style. Significant are the Erkerhaus (bay-fronted house), the Alte Kelter (old winery) the Vogtshof (governor's residence) as well as the town wall with its two gates ‚Äì the 13th century Heilbronner Tor (Heilbronn Gate) and the Neues Heilbronner Tor (New Heilbronn Gate) and the Gef√§ngnisturm (Gaol tower), both of which date from 1772. *The Martinskirche (Martin's Church) in the Lauffen-Stadt district, erroneously named thus since the middle of the 19th century, was built in honour of St Nicholas in around 1200. Not an independent church, it was ministered by priests from Lauffen- Dorf. Following the Reformation the chapel fell into disrepair and became a store for hay and oats. Lauffen's Landturm The Martinskirche was renovated in 1883/4, badly damaged during the Second World War but renovated yet again in 1949 and 1977/78. This chapel, with its single nave, has been used for services since 1978. In 1977/78, several layers of wall paintings were discovered during renovation work. *The Lauffener Rustica Villa is located out of town on the road to Ilsfeld. This Roman villa was excavated in 1978 and has been partially restored. Also on the Ilsfeld road can be seen the remains of the W√ºrttemberg Landgraben (defensive moat) and the Landturm (tower), which was formerly a customs post. Clubs and societies The various clubs and societies include cultural organisations such as a music school and choirs, sports bodies like a rowing club and a swimming club, and parent-teacher associations linked to local schools. In all there are over 70 such bodies: a complete list, together with links, is published on the town's website at  Economy and infrastructure  =Electricity= Former power station on the M√ºhlgraben (millrace) Lauffen am Neckar was the birthplace of alternating current transmission. For the International Electro-Technical Exhibition - 1891 in Frankfurt am Main, Dolivo-Dobrowolsky and Oskar von Miller constructed a three-phase high-voltage transmission line which came into operation on 24 August 1891. For this, a three-phase alternator made by Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon was installed in the cement works at Lauffen, with an overhead cable to carry the current under 15 kV to Frankfurt ‚Äì a distance of . The entrance to the exhibition was lit with 1000 light bulbs and the middle section surmounted by an arch bearing the inscription \\"Power Transmission Lauffen ‚Äì Frankfurt 175 km\\".Moderne Energie f√ºr eine neue Zeit ‚Äì Die Drehstrom√ºbertragung Lauffen a.N.‚ÄìFrankfurt a.M. 1891. 1.

At the close of the exhibition, transmission of current from the Lauffen three-phase alternator was maintained to Heilbronn, which thus became the first town in the world to receive a regular supply of electricity from a remote location. To this day, the name of the local electricity utility, ZEAG (Zementwerk Lauffen ‚Äì Elektrizit√§tswerk Heilbronn AG), is a reminder of this achievement.:de:ZEAG Electricity Supply (German: accessed 6 October 2007) =Wine-growing= The Lauffen winemaking cooperative was founded in 1935 and, with an annual yield of some six million litres and sales of approximately 22 million euros, is one of the largest high-quality cooperatives in the wine region of W√ºrttemberg. The cooperative has some 600 members, the area of vines covering approximately 570 hectares.Imagebrosch√ºre der Lauffener Weing√§rtnergenossenschaft Quality wines marketed under the name \\"Katzenbei√üer\\" are especially well known. In addition to those forming part of the cooperative, other growers cultivate and market their own wines independently. The vineyards at Lauffen are part of the greater Kirchenweinberg area of the W√ºrttemberg lowland winegrowing region. An annual event is the selection of W√ºrttemberg's ‚ÄòWeink√∂nigin‚Äô (Wine Queen), whose role it is to represent the winegrowing industry at events not only in W√ºrttemberg, but also throughout Germany and elsewhere in Europe. A prerequisite for the title holder is a knowledge of wine and the wine-production process. Press Release 79 ‚Äì Weinverband W√ºrttemberg E.V.

The golden trevally is widely distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, ranging from South Africa in the west to Central America in the east, extending to Japan in the north and Australia in the south. The species predominantly occupies inshore waters where it inhabits both reef and sandy substrates. The golden trevally is easily distinguished from its relatives by its fleshy, rubbery lips and unique colouration, which ranges from bright yellow with black bars as a juvenile to a golden-silvery colour as an adult. It is known to grow to 120 cm in length and 15 kg in weight. The golden trevally schools as a juvenile, often closely following larger objects including sharks and jellyfish. The species uses its protractile jaws to suck out prey from the sand or reef, and consumes a variety of fish, crustaceans and molluscs. Spawning aggregations gather at night at different times of the year throughout its range. The golden trevally is a considerable constituent of several Middle Eastern fisheries and being of minor importance to many others, with a worldwide annual catch of 1187 t to 3475 t recorded between 2000 and 2010. The golden trevally is a popular gamefish, taken by bait, lure, fly and also spear throughout its range. Several Asian countries currently farm the fish in caged aquaculture. Due to their brilliant colouration, juveniles are popular in marine aquaria. Taxonomy and phylogeny A school of subadult golden trevally in Panama The golden trevally is the only member of the monotypic genus Gnathanodon, which is one of the thirty genera in the jack and horse mackerel family Carangidae, which in turn is part of the order Carangiformes. The species was scientifically described for the first time by the Swedish naturalist Peter Forssk√•l in 1775. Forssk√•l referred the species to the genus Scomber, where many jacks were placed before the recognition of the family Carangidae. The species is initially referred with two epithets; Scomber rim, speciosus in this publication; however the following page names it as Scomber speciosus with 'rim' given as a transcription of the species' Arabic name. Consequently, authorities regard Scomber rim as a junior synonym. Forssk√•l's description was based on an individual from the Red Sea off Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The holotype has since been lost and a neotype was invalidly designated by Ronald Fricke in 1999. The specific epithet speciosus is Latin for beautiful. The species was transferred to Caranx before the Dutch ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker placed it in its own genus Gnathanodon, with this name derived from the Latin for 'toothless jaws'. In addition to Forssk√•l's naming, seven other later names have been ascribed to the fish, with all of these now recognised as invalid junior synonyms under ICZN rules. The species common names generally refer to its appearance with 'golden trevally' (or kingfish), 'banded trevally' and 'king trevally' used. In Hawaii the species is referred to as 'ulua pa ªopa ªo' or 'papio' when small. A study on the phylogenetic relationships of the Carangidae-based primarily on osteology by Soko Gushiken found that Gnathanodon is closely related to and forms a monophyletic group with Caranx. The species has yet to be included in any molecular phylogeny study of the family. Distribution and habitat A golden trevally foraging in the sandThe golden trevally is widely distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. In the Indian Ocean, the species is distributed from South Africa along the east African coastline, including the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. Its distribution extends east along the Indian and South East Asian coastlines, and south through Indonesia and northern Australia. Golden trevally are recorded from many Indian Ocean islands including Madagascar, Seychelles and The Maldives. In the Pacific, the species is spread throughout the South East Asian and Indonesian archipelago north mainland China and Japan and south to eastern Australia and New Zealand. Golden trevally have been recorded from many central Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, with their distribution extending to central America. Here its range extends from the Gulf of California in the north to Colombia in the south. The golden trevally predominantly occupies inshore waters of varying substrate, although is known to occur on deeper continental shelf reefs in Australia. In coastal areas the species inhabits rocky and coral reefs as well as open sand flats where it forages for food. A systematic study in northern Australia indicated it to be one of the only species to be approximately equally distributed in both reef and soft-bottom habitats. Golden trevally appear to prefer clear water to turbid waters, and thus is only encountered rarely in low turbidity estuarine environments. One known exception to this was the capture of several individuals in a shallow mangrove swamp in Baja California which appeared to be foraging for prey. Description A juvenile golden trevally displaying the prominent dark bands The golden trevally is a relatively large fish, growing to a maximum recorded size of 120 cm (47 in) in length and 15.0 kg in weight. It is similar to most other trevallies and jacks in having a compressed, oblong body, with the dorsal profile slightly more convex than the ventral profile, particularly anteriorly. The species' mouth is one of its defining features; the mouth is highly protractile and fleshy, with specimens greater than 90 mm having no teeth on the jaws, vomer or tongue. Smaller individuals have a series of small villiform teeth in both jaws. The dorsal fin is in two parts, the first with 7 spines, the second with 1 spine and 18 to 20 soft rays. The anal fin has 2 detached spines followed by 1 spine and 15 to 17 soft rays, while the pelvic fin consists of 1 spine and 19 to 20 soft rays. The curved part of the lateral line is moderately arched; containing 62 to 73 scales, and approximately equal in length to the straight section containing 15 to 27 scales and 18 to 25 scutes. The breast is completely scaled. There are 27 to 30 gill rakers and 24 vertebrae in total. The golden trevally's colour is the species most prominent distinguishing feature, and for which it acquired its common names. Juveniles are a bright golden yellow colour over their entire body and all fins, with 7 to 11 black vertical crossbars all over their body. These bars generally alternate between broad and narrow. The caudal fin lobes have dark tips and there is a prominent black edge to the operculum. As the fish grows, the body becomes more silver to silvery golden and the cross bars fade or disappear, often replaced by dark blotches. The fins remain yellow, often with greenish tinges. The dark edge of the operculum also fades with age. Biology and ecology Golden trevally often follow large fish such as this giant grouper. The golden trevally is found either as a solitary individual or in small schools as an adult. Juveniles tend to form larger schools which tend to congregate and follow ( or \\"pilot\\") larger fish such as groupers, sharks, and even jellyfish. This behaviour mimics that of the related pilot fish, Naucrates ductor, with their maneuverability protecting them from their hosts, which in turn provides them with protection from predation from other fish. This behaviour extends to scuba divers, with one diver reporting a single young individual obsessively stationing itself in front of his face plate. The golden trevally is a diurnal foraging carnivore which, unlike other carangids, does not normally seek out individual prey items. The highly protractile mouth possessed by the species is used to form a tube to suck prey out of both reef- and algae-dominated habitats, as well as filtering organisms out of sandy substrates. In the latter case, both sand and any prey items are taken into the mouth and filtered through the gill rakers; sand is expelled, while small organisms are trapped and swallowed. The species takes a variety of prey including crustaceans such as shrimp, crabs, and amphipods, as well as molluscs and small fish. Golden trevally found inhabiting a mangrove swamp were found to have fed exclusively on fish (Mugil curema), suggesting the species also actively hunts down fleeing prey. A laboratory study using only four individuals being fed found that one fish will take the 'lead' position in this situation while another will attack the other fish in the school, apparently in competition for food. A variety of parasites have been recorded from the species, including copepods, flatworms, and a nematode which inhabits the fish's swimbladder. Reproduction in the golden trevally has been studied in both the Indian and Pacific Oceans. In Hawaii, spawning occurred from late February to early October, with a peak from late April to early September. Five distinct peaks during this time were correlated with the first and third quarters of the moon. Spawning occurred from the early evening into the night. In the Indian Ocean, in the southern Persian Gulf, spawning occurred in April and May, with defined peaks in recruitment of juveniles into the local fishery during September and October. The male:female sex ratio in this population was 1:1.01, close to parity. Growth rates were also studied using otoliths in this population, with an increase in growth rate during the winter (November to April). Von Bertalanffy growth curves were also calculated for the species. Relationship to humans A fisherman's catch of golden trevally The golden trevally has long been used as a food fish by humans, with archeological sites in the United Arab Emirates yielding the remains of this species dating back to prehistory. The species is still fished for using many traditional methods in the Pacific Islands, where it is netted and speared when it moves to shallower waters. On a larger commercial scale, the species is often caught using gill nets and other artisanal fish-trapping methods. The FAO catch records for golden trevally indicate it forms a regular part of the fisheries of the UAE, Qatar, and Bahrain and to a much lesser extent in Australia and Singapore. Records in Western Australia indicate commercial fisheries took 3.3 t of golden trevally in 2010, while the catch in Queensland has fluctuated between 0.6 and 5.9 t from 1988-2005. Between 2000 and 2010 the worldwide catch recorded by the FAO varied from 1187 t to 3475 t. The golden trevally is also farmed in cage aquaculture by Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Indonesia, with spawning demonstrated in captivity in Japan. Juvenile golden trevally at Prague Sea Aquarium The often kept juvenile golden trevally hosting an emperor angelfish in an aquarium store. The golden trevally is commonly targeted by both anglers and spearfishermen, and is considered to be a gamefish. Golden trevally will take a variety of baits and lures and may be caught from both the shore and boats, making it a highly accessible species. Baits commonly employed for golden trevally include prawns and a variety of small fish or cut baits. The fish are known to follow a burley stream right up to the back of a boat, allowing for easy capture on unweighted baits. A variety of lures may be employed when targeting the species, including jigs, poppers, spoons, slices, and minnows, with large minnows trolled around reefs often accounting for larger specimens. The use of saltwater fly fishing to specifically target golden trevally has developed in recent years, especially over shallow, sandy flats. In these cases, a sinking line and leader is employed to not spook the fish in these shallow waters. Once hooked, golden trevally are known for fast runs and hard fights, especially when reef or other structures are present. Golden trevally are considered one of the best members of the trevally family for eating, with bleeding recommended. The fish has slightly translucent, dark-pink flesh while fresh, becoming white and juicy during cooking, although has a tendency to become dry, flaky, and fibrous. A rich, tangy fish flavour is noted. town of 1770, Queensland, Australia Juvenile golden trevally are often used in marine aquaria due to their vivid yellow colour and black banding, with larger individuals also kept in larger tanks. The development of laboratory culturing specifically for the aquarium trade has been achieved in Singapore.

The story is told in the Kalki Purana. The prophesy of Kalki and his battle with Kali appears in the Kalki Purana, a collection of predictions concerning when, where and why Kalki will manifest himself and what he will do. According to Hindu cosmology the world will experience four immensely long ages, or yuga, of which the Kali Yuga is the last. The Kali Yuga began in 3102 BCE and has 4270 centuries to left; Kali, the demon-king of the Kali Yuga, will be assisted by his generals, the twin brothers Koka and Vikoka, who will threaten to defeat Kalki by raising themselves from the dead faster than he can kill them. The god Brahma eventually appears to Kalki and reveals to him that no earthly or celestial weapon can kill the brothers if they are allowed to hold on to one another; the only way Kalki can defeat them is to separate and attack them both simultaneously. Kalki then forces himself between the two and lands crushing blows to each demon‚Äôs temple at the same time. They both die, this time forever. The Kalki Purana states Koka and Vikoka are the grandsons of Shakuni and sons of Bakasura, who are not to be confused with the Shakuni and Bakasura from the Mahabharata - former are father and son, whereas the latter are unrelated. The etymology of Koka's name is obscure, and the Monier-Williams Sanskrit dictionary gives no ready definition; Vikoka's name is formed by adding Vi-, used to form names from other names, to \\"Koka\\".

Its ranged throughout North America from the early Blancan ~4 Ma, to the early Irvingtonian (~1.2 Ma). The South American species have been synonymized with Notiomastodon platensis.  Species  The following definite species have been described:Stegomastodon at Fossilworks.org * S. aftoniae * S. mirificus * S. nebrascensis * S. primitivus S. waringi is considered synonymous with S. platensis. A dispute now exists over whether S. platensis should remain within the North and Central American genus Stegomastodon or should be moved over to the exclusively South American genus Notiomastodon. The genus Haplomastodon is regarded as synonymous with the South American Stegomastodon species.  Origin and evolution  Stegomastodon is considered by some to be derived from New World populations of Gomphotherium. The number of species within the genus has varied between S. mirificus being the only valid species, to Osborn's seven species of ‚Äúascending mutations‚Äù (S. primitivus, S. successor, S. mirificus, S. chapmani, S. texanus, S. arizonae and S. aftoniae) Lucas et al, 2013 accepted 3 overlapping chronospecies S. primitivus, S. mirificus S. aftoniae.  Description  Restoration of S. mirificus Stegomastodon mirificus is known from NMNH 10707, a roughly 30-year-old male, of which most of the skeleton has been found. Alive, it stood about tall, with a weight around . Like modern elephants, but unlike most of its closer relatives, it had just two tusks, which curved upward and were about long. The tall, head and robust lower jaw suggest a strong vertical bite. Stegomastodon's molars were covered in enamel and had a complex pattern of ridges and knobbly protrusions on them, giving the creature a large chewing surface that suggests it was a grazer. During the early Irvingtonian, Stegomastodon was replaced by Mammuthus, which was presumably a more efficient grazer. Its brain weighed about . The genus lived in North America from the Zanclean of the Pliocene to the Late Pleistocene. The most recent specimens in the fossil record originate from Jalisco, Mexico, and date to 28,000 BP. but this late date is over 1 million years after the last confirmed specimens.  Taxonomy  The South American Stegomastodon fossils were reassigned to Notiomastodon . Although, in literature, the outdated genus and species names are used until in 2016.

To work in CDMA networks, the R-UIM contains an early version of the CSIM application. The card also contains SIM (GSM) application, so it can work on both networks. It is physically compatible with GSM SIMs and can fit into existing GSM phones as it is an extension of the GSM 11.11 standard.www.3gpp2.org C.S0023 This interface brings one of the main advantages of GSM to CDMA network phones. By having a removable identity card, CDMA users can change phones while keeping their phone numbers by simply swapping the cards. This simplifies many situations such as phone upgrades, phone replacements due to damage, or using the same phone on a different provider's CDMA network. The R-UIM card has been superseded by CSIM on UICC. This technique allows all three applications (SIM, CSIM, and USIM) to coexist on a single smartcard, allowing the card to be used in virtually any phone worldwide that supports smart cards. The CSIM application, a port of R-UIM functionality to the UICC, is defined in standard.www.3gpp2.org C.S0065 This form of card is widely used in China under the CDMA service of China Telecom (The CDMA service of China Telecom was acquired from China Unicom in 2008).

History Aerial view (1954) M√ºntschemier is first mentioned in 1185 as Munchimur. The earliest traces of a settlement in the area are some Mesolithic flint tools which were found at Baholz- Oberfeld. Other prehistoric traces include a Bronze Age grave or ruins of a settlement at M√ºntschemier marsh and a Roman era burial site at Gugleracker. In 1185 the Abbey of St. Johannsen began ruling over the village. In 1474 the entire Herrschaft of Erlach, including M√ºntschemier, was acquired by Berne. It became part of the Bernese court of Ins in the bailiwick of Erlach. In addition to belonging to the court, M√ºntschemier has always been part of the parish of Ins. In 1827, part of the village was destroyed in a fire. It was rebuilt in the following years. The cost of the 1874-83 Jura water correction project forced the B√ºrgergemeinde to sell the common fields or Allmend. In 1876, the B√ºrgergemeinde no longer had a purpose and was dissolved. The Jura water correction helped drain the Grand Marais marsh and allowed the village to spread into the rich farmland left behind. In 1858-63 a major highway through le Grand Marais connected the village with the rest of the country. In 1902 the Berne-Neuchatel railway provided another route into the village. The easy transportation links led to population growth. In 1956 a freight yard and warehouses turned M√ºntschemier into a center for vegetable production and shipping in Switzerland.

History Aerial view (1954) Ins is first mentioned in 1009 as Anestre. In 1179 it was mentioned as Anes. The area around Ins has been inhabited since at least the Iron Age. On Schaltenrain hill, individual graves and groups of grave mounds have been found stretching over of the hill. At least four different sites have been discovered. The first excavation was carried out under the direction of Gustav von Bonstetten in 1848, who placed his discoveries in the Historical Museum of Berne. In the following year, Emanuel F. M√ºller excavated other sites on the hill. The third large excavation was in 1908-09 under Jakob Heierli, who placed his finds in the Museum Schwab in Bienne. Due to the number and variety of artifacts, smaller sites and individual items continue to be discovered. Bonstetten's excavations discovered a minimum of ten grave mounds, in height, arraigned in a line. The sixth mound contained two Hallstatt \\"wagon graves\\" (graves containing wagons or parts of a wagon) from the 7th century BC. Golden objects found in this mound and other nearby mounds show an Etruscan influence or were produced on the Italian peninsula and traded. In addition to gold and the wagons, jewelry made from glass, amber, lignite, pearls and bronze were found. An early La T√®ne iron sword from the 5th century BC was also found. The richness of the finds and the relatively long settlement duration indicates that this was a wealthy and successful settlement that traded with the Mediterranean. During the Roman era there was a wide band of settlements that stretched from the Grosses Moos marsh up into the vineyard covered hills. A Roman road ran through the march and connected the settlements with the Roman towns of the Swiss Plateau. During the Middle Ages Fenis Castle, the seat of the Counts of Fenis, was built on the Hasenburg which is now part of the municipality of Ins. During the Late Middle Ages the village was part of the Herrschaft of Erlach. During the Burgundian Wars, the village along with the Herrschaft of Erlach was annexed by Bern. Under the new Bernese Bailiwick of Erlach, Ins remained an important regional administration center. The former village church of St. Mary was first mentioned as a romanesque building in 1228. However, since it was located close to an early medieval cemetery, it was probably built over or near an earlier church. It was rebuilt in the 16th and 17th centuries. The church's patronage rights were held by the Cathedral of Bern until the Protestant Reformation ended it in the 16th century. Historically the village was surrounded by extensive vineyards. The nearby Grosses Moos marsh was a source of peat from the 18th until the early 20th century. The village was a regional administration and financial center. The old Rathaus was used as the seat of the low court until it burned down in 1848. The village Landgerichtsplatz held the stone Landstuhl for the Landvogt and benches for his court. A tithe barn was built in 1680 for the parish. During the 17th and 18th century wealthy landowners built elegant manor houses in the village, including the Schl√∂ssli, Lilienhof, Altes Spital and Wagnerhaus. Geography Ins has an area of .

The story targets a mature audience. Plot summary The story spans two parts titled \\"Afghanistan's Plains\\" and \\"Black Arrow\\" (after a monologue in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit) each consisting of three issues and centers around a Russian Spetsnaz colonel. In the first part the colonel leads a Russian team investigating a plane crash in Afghanistan. Violence soon erupts after first British and then American military forces become involved in the investigation. In the aftermath, the colonel helps a wounded British Special Air Service trooper who translates a document found on the plane. The document suggests that there is a high-level conspiracy in the United States; that the global war on terror was started in order to facilitate the west taking over the oil-rich Middle East. In the second part the colonel travels alone to the United States in order to carry out a self-assigned mission, where he first faces a sheriff troubled by the loss of his wife because of the deficiency of their insurance. The story also focuses on the problems of illegal Mexican immigrants apparently exploited at a slaughterhouse called \\"McHell\\".

Access on March 16, 2015. After Disney acquired Abadazad, along with the rest of CrossGen's intellectual property, the story was resumed in June 2006 in a hybrid format: a children's book series that combines sequential art segments alternating with prose segments. Originally meant to be a tetralogy, Disney Publishing changed plans to eight Abadazad volumes, of which only three were published. Story Abadazad is a magical land that Kate Jameson ‚Äî a surly, cynical fourteen-year- old child ‚Äî has only known through a series of famous fantasy novels written a century ago by one Franklin O. Davies. When Kate suddenly finds herself journeying through the real Abadazad in search of her beloved younger brother, Matt ‚Äî who vanished five years earlier ‚Äî she discovers that the truth of Abadazad is far stranger, and more amazing, than fiction. She is guided to enter Abadazad by Little Martha, the protagonist of the novels which she had read, and is given cause to confront the villain known as Lanky Man, to whom is ascribed the disappearance of Matt.

The synopsis for Book 4 from Amazon.UK reads as follows: \\"A groundbreaking mix of fiction and full-colour comic strip that follows a headstrong girl's journey into the bizarre fictional world of Abadazad to rescue her brother. In 'Historcery', Kate has finally gathered the group of friends she hopes will help her to rescue her brother Matt from the evil Lanky Man: the walking candle Master Wix, Professor Headstrong, the puppet Mary Annette and Mr Glum.\\" Although he and artist Mike Ploog originally signed up for eight volumes (with hopes for twelve, depending on sales), J.M. DeMatteis said the Abadazad book series ended after three books, and the third book would not released in the United States. DeMatteis credits the Abadazad experience as inspiring his 2010 prose children's fantasy novel Imaginalis. Franklin O. Davies Davies wrote \\"nineteen or twenty\\" Abadazad books, from 1898 to 1924, starting with Little Martha in Abadazad. Other titles mentioned include Queen Ija of Abadazad, The Eight Oceans of Abadazad, Professor Headstrong of Abadazad, The Enchanted Gardens of Abadazad, The Balloonicorn of Abadazad, The Edges of Abadazad, The Battle for Abadazad and The Wretchedly Awful City of Abadazad. Most of these feature Martha Cooper, a small, determined girl who possesses the means, in the form of a blue sphere, of travelling to Abadazad at will. The historical book series reveals that Martha herself had related the stories to Davies, who had written them into books, altering the appearance and characters as he thought best suited the audience. The difference between his version of Abadazad and the version Kate encounters in person is a recurring theme throughout the story. In the original Crossgen comic book, the fictitious author's name had been Franklin O. Barrie. References External links *Official website * J.M.

The technique is called 'reverse' because the palms of the person applying the choke are facing the person who is applying the choke. The thumbs are on top, outside of the clothing and the fingers grab inside underneath the gi or clothing. The hands are high up each side of the neck. Scissoring the hands applies pressure to the carotid arteries reducing blood flow, rapidly resulting in loss of consciousness.

History Pieterlen is first mentioned in 1228 as Perla. In 1268 it was mentioned as Bieterlo. The Vorem Holz 3 archeological site contains the remains of a Bronze Age settlement in the Pieterlen municipality. A first- to third-century Roman estate has also been discovered. During the Middle Ages there were several settlements in the modern municipal borders. A medieval bath house was found at Th√ºrliweg. The early medieval Totenweg cemetery served two different settlements during the 7th-8th centuries. A medieval fortification at Gr√§uschenhubel has also been discovered. During the Late Middle Ages the village was mentioned as the personal property of the Lords of Pieterlan. By the end of the 13th century, the village passed through the hands of a number of nobles before ending up under the Prince-Bishop of Basel. Under the Prince-Bishops the village was combined with Romont, Reiben (now part of B√ºren an der Aare and Meinisberg) to form the southernmost ecclesiastical district of the Erguel seigniory. The low court met in Pieterlen while the high court was in Reiben and was held on the bridge over the Aare river. Militarily it was part of the banner of Biel. In 1797 the region was invaded and annexed by France. It was initially part of the D√©partement of Mont-Terrible, but in 1800 it was transferred to the D√©partement of Haut-Rhin. After the collapse of Napoleonic France in 1815, the village was assigned to the Canton of Bern and in the following year it became part of the newly created B√ºren District. In 1833 the old parish was divided into four new political municipalities; Pieterlen, Meinisberg, Reiben (joined B√ºren an der Aare in 1911) and Romont (joined the Courtelary District in 1840). Murals on the wall of the Protestant village Church of St. Martin The village Church of St. Martin was first mentioned in 1228, though it was built on the site of an earlier, probably 10th century, church. The modern church's nave was built in 1615 and remodeled in 1858. The choir is decorated with medieval murals and the grave plate of the Lords of Eptingen-Wildenstein from the 14th century. The right to appoint the village priest was given to Bellelay Abbey in 1416. Despite the Protestant Reformation and the church becoming Protestant in 1529, the Abbey continued to exercise this right until the secularization of the Abbey in 1797. Today the Reformed parish of Pieterlen includes Meinisberg. Starting in 1860, a number of small businesses and cottage workshops began manufacturing watch and clock parts. The Olten- Biel railroad built a station in the village in 1857. Around 1900 a watch factory and a brick works opened in the village. By 1904 the watch factory employed 80 workers. The factories, good roads and railroad connections transformed Pieterlen from a farming village, producing grain and wine, into an industrial town. The rapidly growing population required places to live so the workers' settlement of Sonnenhof and the new neighborhoods of Rebenweg, Romontweg, Rain and L√∂schgatter were built to house them. After the departure of the watch industry in the 1970s and 1980s, the town diversified its industrial base and built the Industrie-West industrial zone. In 2005 nearly half (49%) of the working population work in industry, while 47% work in the services sector. Starting in 2002, a section of the A5 motorway from Solothurn to Biel was built through the municipality. Aerial view from 400 m by Walter Mittelholzer (1925) The Schl√∂ssli, a country estate for the Wildermeth family of Biel, was built in 1838. Today it is the retirement home Schl√∂ssli. The secondary school opened in the village in 1907. The nature reserve Felsenheide was established outside the town in 1952.

There are also Parish nurses in Australia, the Bahamas, Canada, England, Ghana, India, Kenya, Korea, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Palestine, Pakistan, Scotland, Singapore, South Africa, Swaziland, Ukraine, Wales, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Faith community nursing is a practice specialty that focuses on the intentional care of the spirit, promotion of an integrative model of health and prevention and minimization of illness within the context of a community of faith. The intentional integration of the practice of faith with the practice of nursing so that people can achieve wholeness in, with, and through the population which faith community nurses serve. Parish nursing began in the mid-1980s in Chicago through the efforts of Rev. Dr. Granger Westberg as a reincarnation of the faith community nursing outreach done by religious orders, such as the \\"Parish Deaconesses\\" in Europe and America in the 1800s. Parish nursing is rooted in the Judeo-Christian tradition, and the historic practice of professional nursing, and is consistent with the basic assumptions of many faiths that we care for self and others as an expression of God's love. However, it is not only available to Christian congregations. There are Jewish Congregational Nurses, Muslim Crescent Nurses, and RNs serving in similar capacities within other faith traditions. Faith Community Nursing (FCN) is recognized as a specialty nursing practice. Faith Community Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice was approved by the American Nurses Association in 2005 (and updated in 2012) and define the specialty as \\"...the specialized practice of professional nursing that focuses on the intentional care of the spirit as part of the process of promoting holistic health and preventing or minimizing illness in a faith community.\\" (American Nurses Association, 2012, Faith Community Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, Silver Springs, MD: Author, p1). The 16 standards of Faith Community Nursing Practice reflect the specialty's professional values and priorities and provide practice directions and the framework for practice evaluation. Each standard is measurable by a set of specific competencies that serve as evidence of minimal compliance with that standard. Faith community nursing focuses on a wholistic approach to patient care. Faith community nursing believes that by promoting a wholistic approach this will prevent or minimize illnesses in faith communities (How is faith community nursing the same or different, 2015). Nurses in this specialty, cares for the patient as a whole; physically, emotionally, and spiritually. A good relationship between the nurse and client is vital for this specialty. The role of a faith community nurse is to provide routine spiritual care in partnership with a faith community; it also involves routine implementation and coordination of activities, resourcing and referring. Faith community nurses also maintain the goal of patient care towards wholistic functioning. Patients have needs that are not related to clinical nursing. These needs can affect the way they view their care, the way they receive that care, and the way they engage in that care (The Joint Commission, 2010). For some, their faith is their way to cope with illnesses and stress; faith community nursing helps to bring faith and clinical nursing together to achieve this goal. To become a faith community nurse, the registered nurse must have a minimum of 2 years experience, must have a current license in the state where the faith community is located, and have completed a parish nurse foundations course for the specialty practice as recognized by the American Nurses Association. There are several different curriculum offerings for the faith community nurse which have been developed by a panel of nursing faculty. These are offered though a partnership with the International Parish Nurse Resource Center (IPNRC) at more than 130 nursing schools and health systems around the US and abroad. Faith community nurses serve in several roles, including: ‚Ä¢ Health advisor ‚Ä¢ Educator on health issues ‚Ä¢ Visitor of church members at home or in the hospital ‚Ä¢ Provider of referrals to community resources and provide assistance in obtaining needed health services ‚Ä¢ Developer of support groups within the church ‚Ä¢ Trainer and coordinator of volunteers ‚Ä¢ Provider of health screenings Faith community nursing plays a tremendous role in increasing patient outcomes. Through the encouragement of spirituality, faith community nurses decrease post hospitalization adverse events; decrease hospital readmission's and increase patient's ability to thrive at home after hospital discharge. Post hospitalization adverse events can be decreased with the use of faith community nurses, during post hospital follow up care. Medical guidance and education provided by faith community nursing increases patient‚Äôs adherence. Supportive networks and measure creates leverage when reaching out to hard to reach populations like; poverty stricken, low income, homeless, and medically uninsured individuals. These individuals remain the hardest for health care professionals to keep in touch with after hospital discharge, as well as the most least likely to adhere to medical treatment once discharged. Home visits, follow up care, community services and resources are available to these individuals through the use of faith community nurses. The utilization of social services provides preventative measures, health screening, and education on topics like: exercise, health, and nutritional, to improve the patient‚Äôs health and disease status. Not only does a faith community nurse improve patient outcomes but they also improve the spiritual, mental and physical well-being of the patient, through counseling and the use of other community health programs (Schroepfer, 2016). (SHarrisCSU) It is important to note that faith community nurses are not expected to provide patient care in the church or at a patient's home but rather to be a source of referrals for services in the community. They coordinate existing services and supplement them with a holistic dimension of health and caring. A parish nurse program or faith community nurse program can operate in several different ways. Models include: 1) one church supporting its own full or part-time nurse, 2) several churches supporting one nurse, 3) a group of volunteer nurses supporting one or several churches or 4) a nurse related to a hospital or clinic who supports a church or churches as part of his or her job. Of the several thousand faith community nurses, only about 35% in the US are compensated financially for their ministry. In the United States, faith community nurses typically belong to the Health Ministries Association which is the national professional membership organization for faith community nurses. They also have available the International Parish Nurse Resource Center and the American Nurses Association, among others. The Caribbean has joined the community of Parish Nursing and Health Care Ministry with the launching of Health Care Ministry in The Bahamas. It began with an initial course spanning a three-week period and brought together nurses from various denominations who were commissioned on 27 February 2005. Initially, the Canadian and Australian models of Parish Nursing were introduced to The Bahamas as an extension of the Pastoral Care Ministries of Diocese 2000 & Beyond, a programme of the Anglican Diocese of The Bahamas and Turks & Caicos Islands. To date, more than 60 people have been trained and actively engaged in the ministry as either Parish Nurses or Health & Wellness Carers. Since the ministry began in 2005 it has grown steadily and was known as the Anglican Diocesan Health Care Ministry [Parish Nursing] Council. However, effective 7 March 2008 the name changed to the Ecumenical Health Care Ministry Council. It is intended that there will be continued training and that the programme will spread throughout the Commonwealth of The Bahamas and the Caribbean. To this end, the ministry will be recognised by the Bahamas Christian Council and by extension the Caribbean Council of Churches (Ecumenical Health Care Ministry, Bahamas).

It first began with Jesuit missions, that controlled education for a long time. Then, two hundred years after their arrival, their powers were limited by Marquis de Pombal. Shortly after the Jesuits' power was limited, the Brazilian government took over education and it is now is run by the Brazilian government through the Ministry of Education. Issues in education are now seen through PISA, the Programme for International Student Assessment, and the Idep assessment now used by the Ministry. They have historically tested below average on all topics but are improving in mathematics. Brazil uses both public and private school systems. They have the traditional primary, secondary, tertiary and technical school levels. History Federal University of Paran√° in Curitiba. Medicine College of S√£o Paulo. When Kingdom of Portugal's explorers arrived in Brazil in the 15th century and started to colonize their new possessions in the New World, the territory was inhabited by indigenous peoples and tribes who had no writing system or school education. The Society of Jesus (Jesuits) was, since its beginnings in 1540, a missionary order. Evangelisation was one of the main goals of the Jesuits and they were committed to teaching and education, in Europe and overseas. The missionary activities, in the cities and in the countryside, were complemented by a strong commitment to education. This took the form of the opening of schools for boys, first in Europe but rapidly extended to America and Asia. The foundation of Catholic missions, schools, and seminaries was another consequence of the Jesuit involvement in education. As the spaces and cultures where the Jesuits were present varied considerably, their evangelising methods were very often quite different from one place to another. However, the society's engagement in trade, architecture, science, literature, languages, arts, music and religious debate corresponded to the same main purpose of Christianisation. By the middle of the 16th century the Jesuits were present in West Africa, South America, Ethiopia, India, China, and Japan. This enlargement of their missionary activities took shape to a large extent within the framework of the Portuguese Empire. In a period when the world had a largely illiterate population, the Portuguese Empire was home to one of the first universities founded in Europe ‚Äî the University of Coimbra, which is one of the oldest universities in continuous operation. Throughout the centuries of Portuguese rule, Brazilian students, mostly graduated of the Jesuit missions and seminaries, were allowed and even encouraged to enroll at higher education in mainland Portugal. College of Law. The Jesuits, a religious order founded to promote the cause and teachings of Catholicism, had gained influence with the Portuguese crown and over education, and had begun missionary work in Portugal's overseas possessions, including the colony of Brazil. By 1700, and reflecting a larger transformation of the Portuguese Empire, the Jesuits had decisively shifted from the East Indies to Brazil. In the late 18th century, Portuguese minister of the kingdom Marquis of Pombal attacked the power of the privileged nobility and the church, and expelled the Jesuits from Portugal and its overseas possessions. Pombal seized the Jesuit schools and introduced education reforms all over the empire. In Brazil, the reforms were noted. In 1772, before the establishment of the Science Academy of Lisbon (1779), one of the first learned societies of Brazil and the Portuguese Empire was founded in Rio de Janeiro: the Sociedade Scientifica. In 1797, the first botanic institute was founded in Salvador, Bahia. During the late 18th century, the Escola Polit√©cnica (Polytechnic School) was created, then the Real Academia de Artilharia, Fortifica√ß√£o e Desenho (Royal Academy for Artillery, Fortifications and Design) was created in Rio de Janeiro, 1792, through a decree issued by the Portuguese authorities as a higher education school for the teaching of the sciences and engineering. Its legacy is shared by the Instituto Militar de Engenharia (Military Engineering Institute) and the Escola Polit√©cnica da Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (Polytechnic School of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro) ‚Äî the oldest engineering school of Brazil and one of the oldest in the world. A royal letter of November 20, 1800 by the King John VI of Portugal established the Aula Pr√°tica de Desenho e Figura (Practice Class for Design and Form) in Rio de Janeiro. It was the first institution in Brazil systematically dedicated to teaching the arts. During colonial times, the arts were mainly religious or utilitarian and were learnt in a system of apprenticeship. A decree on August 12, 1816 created the Escola Real de Ci√™ncias, Artes e Of√≠cios (Royal School of Sciences, Arts and Crafts), which established an official education in the fine arts and built the foundations of the current Escola Nacional de Belas Artes (School of Fine Arts). Music school of Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. In the 19th century, the Portuguese royal family, headed by D. Jo√£o VI, arrived in Rio de Janeiro, escaping from the Napoleon's army invasion of Portugal in 1807. D. Jo√£o VI gave impetus to the expansion of European civilization to Brazil. In the short period between 1808 and 1810, the Portuguese government founded the Academia Real dos Guarda Marinha (Royal Naval Academy), the Real Academia Militar (Royal Military Academy), the Biblioteca Nacional (National Library of Brazil), the Jardim Bot√¢nico do Rio de Janeiro (Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden), the Academia M√©dico-Cir√∫rgica da Bahia (Medic-Cirurgical Academy of Bahia), now known as Faculdade de Medicina (Med School) in the Universidade Federal da Bahia (Federal University of Bahia) and the Academia M√©dico- Cir√∫rgica do Rio de Janeiro (Medic-Cirurgical Academy of Rio de Janeiro) which is now the medical school of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Brazil achieved independence in 1822. Until the 20th century, it was a large rural nation with low social and economic standards comparing to the average North American and European standards. Its economy was based on the primary sector, possessing an unskilled and increasingly larger workforce, composed of free people (including slave owners) and slaves or their direct descendants. Among the first law schools founded in Brazil were the ones in Recife and S√£o Paulo in 1827. But for decades to come, most Brazilian lawyers studied at European universities, such as in the ancient University of Coimbra, in Portugal, which had awarded degrees to generations of Brazilian students since the 16th century. In 1872 there were 9,930,478 inhabitants (84.8% free and 15.2% slave). According to the national census made in this year, among the free inhabitants (8,419,672 people), 38% were white, 39% mulattoes (white and black mix), 11% black and 5% caboclos (white and Indian mix). Only 23.4% of the free men and 13.4% of the free women could read and write. In 1889, six decades after independence, only 20% of the total population could read and write. In the former colonial power, Portugal, about 80% of the population was classified as illiterate. With the massive post-war expansion that lasts to date, the government focused on strengthening Brazil's tertiary education, while simultaneously neglecting assistance to primary and secondary education. The problems of primary and secondary education were compounded by significant quality differences across regions, with the northeast suffering dramatically.Ralph Harbison and Eric Hanushek, Educational performance of the poor: lessons from rural northeast Brazil (New York: Oxford University Press, 1992). In the aftermath of Brazilian military rule, education became seen as a way to create a fairer society. \\"Citizen schools\\" emerged, designed to promote critical thinking, incorporation of marginalized people, and curiosity (over rote memorization and obedience).Ignoramuses Academy, 2016 Today, Brazil struggles to improve the public education offered at earlier stages and maintain the high standards that the population has come to expect from public universities. The choice on public funding is an issue. In particular, the U.N. Development Goal of Universal Primary Education and a larger offer of education for students with special needs are pursued by Brazilian policy- makers. Despite its shortcomings, Brazil has progressed substantially since the 1980s. The nation witnessed an increase in school enrollment for children age 7‚Äì14, from 80.9% in 1980 to 96.4% in the year 2000. In the 15-17 age demographic, in the same period, this rate rose from 49.7% to 83%. Literacy rates rose from 75% to 90.0%. Constitution of 1824 Voting has been mandatory for all citizens of Brazil since the first Constitution of 1824. However, people who are illiterate have, historically, not been able to be registered to vote. The Constitution of 1988 changed this, stating that those who are illiterate have the option to vote but it is not compulsory for those. The Constitution of 1824 also stated that those who made less than 100,000 reis were not able to vote. Throughout the 20th century, in response to campaigns occurring in other Latinoam√©rican countries, Brazilian states began their own literacy campaigns. Led by educators like Paulo Freire, the campaigns hoped to combat the high amounts of illiteracy in the countryside. Beginning in 1963, the campaigns were centered in rural areas. Paulo Freire's methods were widely popular due to the immediacy in which they seemed to work: as he claimed, a student could learn to read and write in 40 hours. The growing fear of communism and the rising power of the military led to the end of the campaigns in 1964 and the exile of Freire and others like him. The military government began new campaigns in the late 1970s to questionable improvements.  Issues  According to PISA, the Programme for International Student Assessment, Brazil, on average, underperforms. Brazilian students score lower than the average in reading, mathematics, and science, the three categories of testing. Their scores have improved since 2000, the first year the test was taken. Since 2000, Brazil has started the Brazil Literate Program to lower the rate of illiteracy in those ages 15 and older. Brazil has also implemented the IDEP, the Index of Basic Education Development, which evaluates school flow and performance rates in the test. According to the website, the index is used to tell whether the educational system should be improved. The program is important in deciding public policy of the educational system. IDEP also led to the creation of the Social Mobilisation program which works to involve the entire community in the educational system. Several other committees have created programs in individual municipalities in order to curb the IDEP findings. It takes an extra three years to finish elementary school for low- income students, PNAD, the national household survey, shows. Costs of finishing school rise each year until it is impossible to attend, meaning that low-income students also have the lowest rates for completing school. Rio de Janeiro began a program in 2009 called the Refor√ßo Escolar testing all students in the beginning of the school year to discover all who are not yet at grade level. Those who are not receive two weeks of in-depth tutoring. S√£o Paulo and Paran√° have also created programs to help those who are behind, either due to being low-income or for other reasons. As of 2018, the illiteracy rate for people age 15 or more was of 6.8%  Organization and structure  Table showing how the education system is organized in Brazil Education is divided into three levels, with grades in each level: * Pre- school education (educa√ß√£o infantil) is found in public institutions and private institutions. * Basic education (ensino b√°sico) is found in public institutions and private institutions, and mandatory for those between the ages of 6 and 17. It consists of elementary school (ensino fundamental) and high school (ensino m√©dio). * Higher education (ensino superior) (including graduate degrees) is found in public institutions and private institutions. = Pre-school education (educa√ß√£o infantil) = Pre-school education is optional and exists to aid in the development of children under 6. It aims to assist in all areas of child development, including motor skills, cognitive skills, and social skills while providing fertile ground for the later acquisition of knowledge and learning. There are day nurseries for children under 2, kindergartens for 2- to 3-year-olds, and preschools for children 4 and up. Public preschools are provided by city governments. = Elementary school (ensino fundamental) = Elementary school is mandatory for children ages 6‚Äì14. There are nine \\"years\\" (as opposed to the former eight \\"grades\\"). The current \\"first year\\" broadly corresponds to the former pre-school last year of private institutions, and its aim is to achieve literacy. Generally speaking, the only prerequisite for enrolling in first year is that a child should be 6 years old, but some education systems allow children younger than 6 to enroll in first year (as long as they turn 6 during the first academic semester). Older students who have not completed their elementary education are allowed to attend, though those over 18 are separated from the younger children. The National Council of Education (Conselho Nacional de Educa√ß√£o) establishes a core curriculum consisting of Portuguese language, history, geography, science, mathematics, arts and physical education (for years 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5). As for years 6, 7, 8 and 9, one or two foreign languages are also compulsory (usually English and an optional language). Each education system supplements this core curriculum with a diversified curriculum defined by the needs of the region and the abilities of individual students. Elementary education is divided in two stages, called Ensino Fundamental I (years 1‚Äì5) and Ensino Fundamental II (years 6‚Äì9). During Ensino Fundamental I each group of students is usually assisted by a single teacher. In Ensino Fundamental II, there are as many teachers as subjects. The length of the school year is set by the National Education Bases and Guidelines Law (Lei de Diretrizes e Bases da Educa√ß√£o) to at least 200 days. Elementary schools must provide students with at least 800 hours of activities per year. The school calendar is set by individual schools, which often organize their calendars according to planting and harvesting seasons in rural areas. Public elementary schools are funded by municipal and state governments. The education is similar to the British. =High school (ensino m√©dio)= Students must have finished their elementary school before they enroll in high school. Secondary education takes three years. The minimum is 2,200 hours of teaching over four years. Secondary education core curriculum comprises Portuguese (including Portuguese language, essay studies, Brazilian and Portuguese literatures), foreign language (usually English, also Spanish and very rarely French), History, Geography, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Philosophy and Sociology, which were banned during the military dictatorship (1964‚Äì1985), have become compulsory again. High school education is provided by all levels of government. =Technical education (ensino t√©cnico)= The movement of the eleventh or twelfth grade of high school or the end of those grades is mandatory for those wishing to pursue technical education, through courses in several areas of knowledge. In addition, students must pass an entrance examination for their specific course. These institutions usually have a greater number of hours per week. The instruction of the technical course lasts from one year and a half to two years. =Higher education (ensino superior)= Federal University of Minas Gerais TV station in Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte The secondary education is mandatory for those wishing to pursue higher education. In addition, students must pass a competitive entrance examination (known as vestibular) for their specific course of study. The number of candidates per available place in the freshman class may be in excess of 30 or 40 to one in the not so competitive courses at the top public universities. The most competitive ones excess 80 or 150. In some courses with small number of vacancies, this number can be as high as 200 (medical school, for example). As is the case in many nations, higher education in Brazil can be divided into undergraduate and graduate work. In addition to providing education, universities promote research and provide separate classes to the community. The Brazilian standard for technology, licentiate or bachelor's degree is awarded in most areas of the arts, humanities, social sciences, exact sciences, or natural sciences, and lasts two to three years for technology courses, three to four years for licenciate and bachelor's courses in general and five to six years for special bachelor's courses such as law, architecture, engineering, human medicine and veterinary medicine. After graduation students can take postgraduate courses being these latu sensu or stricto sensu. Latu sensu graduate degrees are specializations and refinements lasting one to two years and do not confer academic title. At the end of the course the student must present a course completion work. (Example of latu sensu: MBA, specialization, medical residency, among others). Graduate degrees stricto sensu are courses that confer academic title. After graduation, the student must do a master's degree with a duration of two years and after that period present a master's thesis. If it is approved by the examining board, it will receive the master's degree. The doctorate course in Brazil is the most academic degree course. In order to study this postgraduate course it is necessary to have the title of Master. The doctorate has a duration of four years and must be unpublished. After four years of course the student will present the doctoral thesis to an assessment bank, if approved will receive the title of Doctor. There are more than 2,600 universities in Brazil, between private and public, according to MEC. Higher vocational education is in general assumed by non-university institutions and the federal Institutions for Education, Science and Technology (38 in 2008). Studies show that, despite the expansion of access to Higher Education in Brazil, this had very limited impact on the country's social disparities. Teacher training and qualification Students can obtain teacher training in secondary schools through vocational programs. In addition to the required courses to graduate, students take teacher training courses which includes a supervised internship and need 300 hours of teaching practice. Students can be certified through the secondary school program; however, to teach secondary schools, most teaching students need higher education to obtain either a master's or doctorate's. Schools do offer school administration training, but it is not compulsory for students hoping to become an administrator. The licenses and degrees are as follows: teaching certification through vocational programs, a bachelor's, master's, and doctorate. Recently, the government has released a new National Education Plan outlining 20 goals to improve national education, four of which outline improvements to teacher training. Educational statistics Private German school in S√£o Paulo. As a large middle-income country, Brazil has several regions. Its education system is accordingly plagued by many deficiencies and social and regional disparities. As of 2017: *Literacy rate of 91.73% for people age 15 or older As of 2017: *The nation invests 5.95% of GDP on education, approximately 15.72% of total government expenditures.

ISC defines an 'international school' in the following terms: \\"ISC includes an international school if the school delivers a curriculum to any combination of pre-school, primary or secondary students, wholly or partly in English outside an English- speaking country, or if a school in a country where English is one of the official languages, offers an English-medium curriculum other than the country‚Äôs national curriculum and is international in its orientation.\\" This definition is used by publications including The Economist.

The picture stars Keaton and Marceline Day. The Cameraman was Keaton's first film with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. It is considered by fans and critics to be Keaton still in top form, and it was added to the National Film Registry in 2005 as being deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\\" Within a little over a year, however, MGM would take away Keaton's creative control over his pictures, thereby causing drastic and long-lasting harm to his career. Keaton was later to call the move to MGM \\"the worst mistake of my career.\\"Buster Keaton web site. Plot Buster (Buster Keaton), a sidewalk tintype portrait photographer in New York City, develops a crush on Sally (Marceline Day), a secretary who works for MGM Newsreels. To be near her, he purchases an old film camera, emptying his bank account, and attempts to get a job as one of MGM's filmers. Harold (Harold Goodwin), an MGM cameraman who has designs on Sally himself, mocks his ambition. Sally, however, encourages Buster and suggests he film anything and everything. Buster's first attempts show his total lack of experience. He double exposes or over exposes much of the footage, and the rest is simply no good. Despite this setback, Sally agrees to go out with Buster, after her Sunday date cancels. They go to the city plunge (pool), where Buster gets involved in numerous mishaps. Later, Harold offers Sally a ride home; Buster has to sit in the rumble seat, where he gets drenched in the rain. The next day, Sally gives him a hot tip she has just received that something big is going to happen in Chinatown. In his rush to get there, he accidentally runs into an organ grinder, who falls and apparently kills his monkey. A nearby cop makes Buster pay for the monkey and take its body with him. The monkey turns out only to be dazed and joins Buster on his venture. In Chinatown, Buster films the outbreak of a Tong War, narrowly escaping death on several occasions. At the end, he is rescued from Tong members by the timely arrival of the police, led by a cop (Harry Gribbon) who had been the unintentional victim of several of Buster's antics over the last few days. The cop tries to have him committed to the mental hospital, but Buster makes his escape with his camera intact. Returning to MGM, Buster and the newsreel company's boss are dismayed to find that he apparently forgot to load film into his camera. When Sally finds herself in trouble for giving Buster the tip, Buster offers to make amends by leaving MGM alone once and for all. Buster returns to his old job, but does not give up on filming, setting up to record a boat race. He then discovers that he has Tong footage after all; the mischievous monkey had switched the reels. Sally and Harold are speeding along in one of the boats. When Harold makes too sharp a turn, the two are thrown into the river. Harold saves himself, but Sally is trapped by the circling boat. Buster stops filming to jump in and rescues her. The monkey gets behind the camera to film the daring rescue. When Buster rushes to a drug store to get medical supplies to revive her, Harold returns and takes credit for the rescue. The two go off, leaving the broken-hearted Buster behind. Buster decides to send his Tong footage to MGM free of charge. The boss decides to screen it for Harold and Sally for laughs, but is thrilled by what he sees, calling it the best camerawork he has seen in years. They also see footage of Buster's boat footage and the monkey's shot of Buster's rescue of Sally. The boss sends Sally to get Buster. She tells him he is in for a great reception. Buster assumes a ticker-tape parade is in his honor, whereas it is really for Charles Lindbergh.

Buster Keaton: Cut to the Chase. New York, NY: Da Capo Press. 1997. . p. 184. The deal required 2 films per year from Keaton and paid him $3,000 a week, making him the third highest-paid actor at the studio. Keaton brought most of his own crew with him from his own independent production company. He immediately pitched the idea for The Cameraman to MGM, who paid him $1,250 for it.Meade. 1997. p. 185. Keaton later said that the MGM deal was \\"the worst mistake of my life.\\"Wakeman, John (1987). World Film Directors, Volume 1. New York, New York: The H. W. Wilson Company. . p. 529. The film was overseen by producer Lawrence Weingarten. Weingarten and Keaton fought on set and Weingarten called Keaton a child. Keaton was accustomed to complete control over his own productions and was unaccustomed to interference from producers.Meade. 1997. p. 186. However MGM's head of production Irving Thalberg loved the finished film and laughed during screenings of its rushes (a rare display of emotion from Thalberg).Meade. 1997. p. 187. 22 writers were assigned to work on it, but Keaton convinced Thalberg to throw out the script and allow him to film it his own way.Wakeman. 1987. p. 529. The Cameraman would later serve as inspiration for part of the 1950 comedy Watch the Birdie, starring Red Skelton, with Keaton working as a gagman for MGM and serving as an advisor to Skelton. Critical reception The film was a box office hit, grossing $797,000, and was well-received by film critics. MGM writing department used the film to train new writers as a \\"perfectly constructed comedy\\" for decades. Critic Mordaunt Hall, writing for the New York Times, liked the film and the work of Buster Keaton. He said, \\"Mr. Keaton's latest effort is The Cameraman, which is filled with guffaws and grins, the sort of thing with many original and adroitly worked-out gags. But whether they belong to the story is immaterial...There are other sections that are wild and watery, but nonetheless humorous.\\"Hall, Mordaunt. The New York Times, film review, September 17, 1928. David Robinson wrote that the film \\"betrays nothing of the struggle and strain that went into its preparation. It is a lucid, beautifully formed dramatic comedy.\\" Honors In 2005, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Preservation status The Cameraman was at one point considered a lost film, destroyed in the 1965 MGM vault fire. However, a complete print was discovered in Paris in 1968. Another print, of much higher quality, although missing some footage, was discovered in 1991. The two prints were combined into a version which now is available. The Cameraman was released on Blu-ray and DVD through The Criterion Collection on June 16, 2020.

The overhaul came at a time when the president's leadership abilities were being broadly questioned, and he was being heavily criticized by California governor Ronald Reagan and others from the nascent conservative wing of the Republican Party.  Cabinet shake-up  The shake-up had its roots at the beginning of Ford's presidency in August 1974. As was the case when Lyndon Johnson and Harry S. Truman succeeded to the presidency intra-term, in 1963 and in 1945 respectively, under similarly strained sets of circumstances, Ford inherited President Richard Nixon's cabinet and staff of presidential advisers. Over the course of several months, Ford slowly replaced several Nixon holdovers with his own appointees. These two groups often clashed, and the resulting acrimony often got in the way of policy making. The changes were: *Henry Kissinger was fired as National Security Advisor (Kissinger retained his post as Secretary of State), and replaced by Brent Scowcroft. *William Colby was fired as Director of Central Intelligence and replaced by Ambassador (and future President) George H. W. Bush. Colby was offered the post of U.S. Permanent Representative to NATO, but declined. *James Schlesinger was fired as Secretary of Defense and replaced by Chief of Staff Donald Rumsfeld. Rumsfeld's deputy and prot√©g√©, future Vice President Dick Cheney, moved up to be the Chief of Staff. *Under pressure from Republican Party conservatives, Vice President Nelson Rockefeller announced that he would not run for election as Ford's running mate in 1976. Subsequent to these events, Rogers Morton was also replaced by Elliot Richardson as Secretary of Commerce.  Impact and legacy  Various newspaper and magazine articles at the time identified Donald Rumsfeld as the one orchestrating these events. At the time, Ford said he alone was responsible for firings. Later, he expressed regret: \\"I was angry at myself for showing cowardice in not saying to the ultraconservatives, 'It‚Äôs going to be Ford and Rockefeller, whatever the consequences.'\\"  References  Category:Ford administration controversies Category:November 1975 events in the United States ","title":"Halloween Massacre"},{"id":"5656538","text":"is a retired Japanese actor.

History Originally it was known as Rufshausen and that name was first recorded in 1100 as Rudolfshausen. It was first mentioned in 1677 as Schwartzenhe√º√üeren, a name that would become Schwarzh√§usern. Several mesolithic or neolithic flint tools have been found in sites around the municipality. There are several early medieval graves at Klebenrain. By the 13th century, a bridge was built over the Aare river, which connected the village to regional center of power in Aarwangen. In 1432, Aarwangen came under Bernese power and brought neighboring Schwarzh√§usern with it. For a few decades, Bern and Solothurn shared authority over the parish of Niederbipp, which included Schwarzh√§usern. However, in 1463, it came completely under Bern's control. Following the 1798 French invasion, under the Helvetic Republic it became part of the District of Wangen. Schwarzh√§usern remained in the Wangen district until 1871, when it joined the Aarwangen district. During the 17th and 18th centuries cottage industry weaving began to supplement agriculture in the local economy. During the 19th century, as agriculture became increasingly mechanized and required fewer workers, many residents were forced to emigrate to find work. At the beginning of the 21st century, agriculture and small businesses provide only 17% of the jobs in the municipality and about three-quarters of the workers commute to nearby towns for work. It shares an upper secondary school with Bannwil and Aarwangen and a Gymnasium with Langenthal. Geography Aerial view of Schwarzh√§usern, showing the Aare river Schwarzh√§usern has an area of .

Of the agricultural land, 40.9% is used for growing crops and 10.6% is pastures. All the water in the municipality is flowing water. Schwarzh√§usern lies in the Oberaargau in the Swiss plateau on the left bank of the Aare and the border with the Canton of Solothurn. It consists of the village of Schwarzh√§usern and the hamlets of Rufshusen and Moosbach as well as scattered farm houses. At the southern end of the municipality the Aare has a reservoir created by the hydroelectric plant of Wynau. On 31 December 2009 Amtsbezirk Aarwangen, the municipality's former district, was dissolved.

The park, named after Sara Roosevelt (1854‚Äì1941), the mother of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, stretches north-south along seven blocks between East Houston Street on the Lower East Side and Canal Street in Chinatown, bordered by Chrystie Street on the west and Forsyth Street on the east. The park is operated and maintained by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. The park cuts off Stanton, Rivington, Broome and Hester Streets between Chrystie and Forsyth Streets, and is crossed by Delancey and Grand Streets. History The site was previously occupied by walk-up apartments and before that, an African-American burial ground. Originally, part of it was the Dutch Reformed Church Cemetery. The land was originally acquired by the City of New York in 1929 for the purpose of widening Chrystie and Forsythe Streets and building low-cost housing, but was instead used for parkland. The new park was named for Sara Roosevelt in 1934 despite her written objection. It was designed under the leadership of newly installed Parks Commissioner Robert Moses, landscape architect Gilmore D. Clarke, and architect Aymar Embury II. The original design placed an emphasis on athletic fields and \\"active recreation\\" spaces for children, such as wading pools, with separate areas for boys and girls. In later decades, community groups adapted the park to various uses. The Sara D. Roosevelt Park Coalition, formed in 1982, established the M‚Äôfinda Kalunga community garden in 1983, and has initiated several other initiatives. Another group, the Forsyth Garden Conservancy, has built several smaller gardens inside the park since the mid-1990s, including the Hua Mei Bird Garden, where songbird owners congregate. Amenities The park offers playing surfaces for several sports, including a basketball court, roller skating rink and a soccer field. It is also the home of the New York City Bike Polo Club. The park had a service facility which included a public restroom until 1994, when it was closed. Memorials In the park, just south of Stanton Street, the M‚ÄôFinda Kalunga Garden honors the memory of an African-American burial ground that was located on nearby Chrystie Street between Rivington and Stanton Streets. A commemorative plaque was installed in 1983. Across Forsyth Street from the Park, between Stanton and Rivington Streets, was the \\"Garden of Eden\\", a community garden during 1975‚Äì1985 created by local activist and environmentalist Adam Purple.

He studied music at Loyola University New Orleans, where he studied under Dorothy Hulse, also the teacher of Audrey Schuh and Harry Theyard; he graduated in 1951. The tenor sang the role of the Messenger in Il trovatore, at the New Orleans Opera Association, in 1947. At the age of twenty-two, he auditioned under his birth name for the Metropolitan Opera's Auditions of the Air. He won the auditions, but Sir Rudolf Bing convinced him to drop his surname, saying that it would invite comparisons with Enrico Caruso. At the Metropolitan Anthony made his debut at the Metropolitan on March 6, 1954, playing the role of the Simpleton in Boris Godunov. Critics were impressed; The New York Times wrote, \\"Mr Anthony had better be careful. If he does other bit parts so vividly, he'll be stamped as a character singer for life.\\" In the event, this proved true; although Anthony performed some larger roles early in his career (including Don Ottavio, to the Donna Anna of Herva Nelli, in Don Giovanni), he made his mark as a comprimario singer. On February 17, 1992, following Act II of a performance of Puccini's Tosca, Anthony was honored in an onstage ceremony on the occasion of his breaking the record of George Cehanovsky for most appearances by an artist at the Metropolitan Opera.

The first office was in the Keeler building, in downtown Grand Rapids, Michigan. Children's Bible Hour's first director, was \\"Uncle Mel\\" Johnson, who served from 1942 to 1946. Dr. D.O. Fuller, pastor of Wealthy Street Baptist Church, served as chairman of the CBH board from the very beginnings in 1942 for thirty-three years. One of the first two aunts, \\"Aunt Dorothy\\" Boli, described the radio program as \\"... an hour long divided into four sections - Bible Question Time, Chorus Time, Bible Memory Time, Bible Story Time, each having fifteen minutes. As to the script, there was little written out... most of the program was ad lib. But the spontaneous response and harmonious spirit made it a lively and profitable program.\\" By 1943, CBH was being heard world-wide via HCJB Radio. That year, a printed communication with their listeners and donors was started with the \\"CBH News\\". They also started printing yearly calendars to encourage people to pray for them regularly. Nineteen years later, the \\"Cheery Chats\\" newsletter was introduced as a bi-monthly contact with contributors. It was changed twenty-seven years later to \\"News And Notes\\". The year Children's Bible Hour went global, 1943, the one year anniversary celebration was the beginning of a 56-year series of annual rallies. The first rally was held at the Welsh Civic Auditorium in Grand Rapids. From 1944 to 1999, the song \\"Boys And Girls For Jesus\\" was the rallying cry for CBH. Beginning in 1945, Mr. Trover wrote many of the radio dramas aired, and when CBH needed a new office manager, he recommended his sister Bertha Shooks, from Canton, Ohio, and she later became CBH's third executive director until 1972, and became well known as \\"Aunt Bertha\\". For many years, starting in 1958, Aunt Bertha gathered many interested ladies every month to pray for the ministries. That same year, the future \\"Uncle Charlie\\" at age nine was picked out of a studio audience to read, and he joined CBH two years later in 1947 and after college graduation joined CBH full-time as an assistant director to Aunt Bertha. Uncle Charlie continued serving as the ministries' \\"Ambassador-at- Large\\" until his death at the age of 84 in February 2019. In 1949, CBH began a television ministry that was broadcast live and produced in a 13 program series for several years. In 1958, \\"Search The Scriptures\\" correspondence Bible course was launched, eventually over 7,000 were enrolled in the course. In 1970, a lending library was started where cassettes of the broadcast were made available to missionaries, military and others that weren't able to access the program on radio. In 1971, recognition for CBH's growth came from a future US president, Gerald R. Ford. Around that same time, a \\"Phone-A-Story\\" ministry started in Tucson, Arizona, where children could phone in and hear shortened stories. Eight years later, it was being used in over 170 areas of the United States. In 1965, the first foreign language program was released in Russian of the 15 minute story aired on HCJB and continues to air today. In 1981, CBH began broadcasting in Chinese, and eventually in Spanish, Romanian, Russian, and the Ilongo dialect in the Philippines. In January 1982, the idea for a devotional for kids was incubated at CBH, and the first run of 5,000 copies of Keys for Kids was in the mail. Demand was so great, there was an immediate reprint of 10,000 more of the first issue. In September 1984, the Keys Radio program was started as a 4¬Ω minute broadcast six days a week hosted by Uncle Charlie based on the Keys for Kids devotional, and continues to be printed, posted online in text and audio files, and emailed. In 1986, a Spanish version, Tesoros Para Ninos (Treasures For Children) was first released, stories adapted to the fit the culture and language. Keys for Kids was also translated into Romanian, Portuguese, and Arabic, among many other languages throughout the world. In 1988, Tyndale House began publishing the One-Year Book of Devotional line using Keys For Kids. In just four years, over 100,000 were being printed yearly, and it continued in print for nine editions. A full broadcast singing group began touring the United States and Canada every summer for 10-day music concert tours in 1976, and every month through the rest of the year in Michigan. Also, along the line of music, \\"Mr. Paul\\" Storm sang in 1940s programs, and played guitar on the program starting in the 1960s. Ken Louis also served as the music director for 39 years. In 1996, CBH launched their first website, as one of the first to be part of the www.gospel.com work. In 2006, CBH's second website won the award for \\"Christian Broadcaster Website of the Year\\". In 1999, Uncle Charlie was promoted from Director to Ambassador-At-Large and traveled with his wooden friends Wally and Chico, and bag of magic tricks illustrating the Gospel, throughout the United States, as well as Canada, Jamaica, Fiji Islands, Europe and Africa with his ministry. Randy Hekman served as Director from 1999 to 2003, and helped develop \\"Down Gilead Lane\\" as well as starting a radio ministry called \\"Parent Minute\\". A former juvenile court judge, as well as father of twelve children, he had a strong desire to reach children with the Gospel. In 2002, CBH partnered with Tyndale Ministries to publish seasons of Down Gilead Lane in Christian bookstores. In 2003, Mrs. Terre Ritchie stepped in as Executive Director after thirty years in children's ministry, and thirteen years on the CBH Board of Directors. By 2004, over 45,000 Keys For Kids devotions were being printed and marketed around the nation. In 2005, the first two booklets of a new Bible Study called Camp-Be-Yon-Key was printed to give children a more in-depth study beyond Keys For Kids. By 2007, CBH was up to 95,000 Keys for Kids every month. Ritchie retired in August 2015. The current Executive Director (thru at least October 2019) is Greg Yoder. On Friday, February 22, 2019, Charles \\"Uncle Charlie\\" Vander Meer passed away at the age of 84. He is missed by the generations he influenced.

Geography The community is located in a valley of the same name, only a few kilometres east of the border with North Rhine-Westphalia. Rittershausen has 952 inhabitants, representing 14.2% of Dietzh√∂lztal's population (as of 31 December 2005), making it the constituent community with the smallest population, but with a rural area of 1 847 ha (Dietzh√∂lztal: 3 744 ha), that is, 49.3%, Rittershausen is almost as big as the three other communities of Ewersbach, Mandeln and Steinbr√ºcken put together. The reason for this relates to what happened in the Late Middle Ages (see History below). =Neighbouring communities= Dietzh√∂lztal borders in the northwest on the town of Netphen, in the north on the town of Bad Laasphe (both in Siegen-Wittgenstein district in North Rhine-Westphalia), in the east on the community of Breidenbach (Marburg-Biedenkopf), in the southeast on the community of Eschenburg, and in the southwest on the town of Haiger (both in the Lahn-Dill-Kreis). =Constituent communities= The community consists of the following centres: * Ewersbach * Mandeln * Rittershausen * Steinbr√ºcken History In the Middle Ages, the upper Dietzh√∂lze Valley (German: Dietzh√∂lztal ‚Äì the community's namesake), owing to its great number of trees, was an important centre for metal production. The ores were mined in the Dillenburg area and smelted in furnaces in the Dietzh√∂lze Valley. Thus the \\"Hammerweiher\\" was dammed up at Steinbr√ºcken. Even today, a few metalworking companies are still represented in the Dietzh√∂lze Valley, among them Kreck Metallwarenfabrik GmbH in Rittershausen. =Ewersbach= As of 1 January 2004, Ewersbach had 3,329 inhabitants. It was first documented mention under the name Ebirspach in 1302. Ewersbach itself was an amalgamation of three former villages, Bergebersbach, Stra√üebersbach, and Neuh√ºtte. The last-named former village's name means \\"new foundry\\", reflecting the area's traditional industry. =Mandeln= Mandeln, with 1200 years of history behind it, is one of the district's oldest villages. It had its first documentary mention on 13 July 800 according to the Lorsch Codex (Bayerisches Hauptstaatsarchiv, HL Mainz 19, folg. 210 v. [12th century]). A landlord named Lager and his wife Duda donated to the Nazarius Monastery at Lorsch (near Heppenheim) under Richbodo's abbacy three farmyards, as many subsistence farms and five bound farmers in Mauventelina (Mandeln) in the Perfgau, whose political and ecclesiastical centre was Breidenbach. This old village, under the name Moyndille, lasted until at least 1298, but the village's downfall eventually came, presumably as a result of a dispute between the Landgraves of Hesse and the Counts of Nassau, putting the date of the destruction sometime between 1433 and 1443. The village lay waste, though, for hardly any longer than half a century, for in 1489, about a kilometre south of where the old village had stood, came the refounding of Mandeln by the widow von Hutzmanns Heinz with her son Henn, and Gerlach, a certain Mr. Palmenie's son-in-law from Roth in Hesse. The population grew steadily, with the odd slight swing, between 1489 and 2005. The greatest change, and the only major one in a short time, came in 1597 when the population fell from about 100 to about 20 owing to the Plague. A greater than average rise in population was seen in the 1970s due to the eviction of the weekend cottage area of Ebachseite and the arrival of guest workers' families. An upswing also came with German Reunification and the inflow of ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union. In 2004, there were 1430 people living in Mandeln in 450 houses. =Rittershausen= For Rittershausen's age, one must look at historical evidence stretching across the whole time period from the 8th to 13th centuries. The old form of the name, Rudershusz, the favoured location in the Dietzh√∂lze Valley, and the village's persistence even during the period of abandonments (due to an agrarian depression) in the Late Middle Ages all suggest that Rittershausen was founded in the 9th century, or at the latest, the 10th. There were, however, people living in the area much longer ago. About 1912, the Reverend Karl Nebe, with sponsorship from councillor of commerce and local landowner Gustav Jung, and under the leadership of the State Museum in Wiesbaden, carried out a number of digs around the Ley (‚âà cliff or crag). Ceramic objects, tools and jewellery were unearthed from what turned out to be a ringwall, as these structures are known, from Celtic times, between 450 and 250 BC, in the time of the La T√®ne culture. Rittershausen's first documentary mention came in 1344 when the Mann- und Zinsbuch der Herren von Bicken (\\"Man and Interest Book of the Lords of Bicken\\") mentioned that in Ruderszhausen disz seyt der Bach (ie \\"this side of the brook\\"), the Lords were entitled to Gro√ü- und Kleinzehnt (great and small tithes). Within the fields attached to Rittershausen once lay the villages of Langenbach, Dunnenbach, Hilgeshausen, and possibly also Kirsebach. Nobody quite knows when these places were abandoned, but according to the aforesaid Reverend Karl Nebe, who was reporting local oral history, Langenbach was destroyed by the Plague, and the last few survivors moved to Rittershausen. Langenbach is mentioned in a list of nobles from about 1400, but in the record of the sale of the court district of Ewersbach by the Lords of Bicken to the Counts of Nassau, Langenbach is not mentioned, and there has been no further mention of it. To this day, there is a field called Dorfwiese ‚Äì \\"Village Meadow\\" ‚Äì even though the village disappeared centuries ago. These former villages' rural areas are now attached to Rittershausen.

Painted between 1970 and 1971, it depicts the fashion designer Ossie Clark and the textile designer Celia Birtwell in their flat, shortly after their wedding, with one of the couple's cats on Clark's knee. The white cat depicted in the painting was Blanche; Percy was another of their cats, but Hockney thought \\"Percy\\" made a better title. Background The work is part of a series of double portraits made by Hockney from 1968, often portraying his friends. Hockney and Clark had been friends since meeting in Manchester in 1961, and Hockney was Clark's best man at his wedding to Birtwell in 1969. Hockney did preparatory work for the painting from 1969, making drawings and taking photographs. He worked on the painting from early 1970 to early 1971. Description The couple are depicted in the bedroom of their flat in Notting Hill Gate, near life size, either side of a tall window with a pair of shutters, one open to reveal the balustrade of a balcony looking out over trees to a Georgian fa√ßade beyond. To the left, Birtwell stands in a purple dress with hand on hip; to the right sits Clark in green jumper and trousers, lounging on a modern metal-framed chair with his bare feet in the thick pile of a rug and a cigarette in his left hand, and with a white cat on his lap. Both Birtwell and Clark are looking out at the viewer, drawing them as a third person into the composition. The cat rebels by ignoring the viewer, looking out of the window instead. The room is relatively bare and uncluttered, in simple 1960s minimalist style, with a telephone and a lamp on the floor to the right of Clark, and a plain table to the left of Birtwell bearing a vase of lilies and a yellow book. There is a framed print on the wall behind her. Hockney worked and reworked the portraits many times until he was satisfied, repainting Clark's head perhaps twelve times. He has described the style of the painting as being close to naturalism, although the surfaces are characteristically abstracted and flattened. Hockney achieves the difficult task of balancing the dark figures \\"contre-jour\\", against the light flooding in through the window behind them. The work is in acrylic on canvas, and measures (or in its frame). The painting was presented to the Tate Gallery by the friends of the gallery in 1971, and remains in the Tate collection. It featured in the final ten of the Greatest Painting in Britain Vote in 2005, the only work by a living artist to do so. Symbolism Hockney drew on both the Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck and A Rake's Progress by William Hogarth in the symbolism and composition of the painting. A copy of a Hockney etching, showing his own interpretation of A Rake's Progress (1961‚Äì63), is on the wall behind Birtwell. The positions of the two figures are reversed from the Arnolfini Portrait, with the implication that Birtwell is the assertive partner. Hockney's portrait, with the bride standing and the groom sitting, also reverses the convention of traditional wedding portraiture, such as Mr and Mrs Andrews by Thomas Gainsborough. The lilies next to Birtwell, a symbol of female purity, are also associated with depictions of the Annunciation (at the time of the portrait Birtwell was pregnant). The cat \\"Percy\\" (slang for penis) sits erect on Clark's crotch. The cat is a symbol of infidelity and envy, echoing the dog (a symbol of fidelity) in the Arnolfini Portrait. In this case, Clark continued to have affairs with men and women, which contributed to the breakdown of the marriage in 1974: Hockney's depiction of the couple together but separated foreshadows their divorce. The informal interior scene littered with symbolic objects echoes Victorian paintings, such as William Holman Hunt's The Awakening Conscience.

Since the German Mediatisation Meitingen belongs to Bavaria in 1803. In 1844 the railroad line Augsburg-N√ºrnberg arrived Meitingen. The construction of the Lech-channel determined series of flooding caused by the river Lech. In 1928 the Catholic priest Dr. Max-Josef Metzger founded the Christk√∂nigshaus. Because of his dedication in the international peace movement he was a thorn in the Nazis' flesh. He was murdered after a denunciation in Brandenburg- G√∂rden in 1944. His corpse rests at the local graveyard. His gravestone, a memorial tablet at the Christk√∂nigshaus, the name of a street and of the secondary school remember his dedication. With the construction of the hydro- electric power plant of the Lech-channel the industrialization of Meitingen started. Until 1972 Meitingen was a part of the district of Wertingen but because of local government reforms Erlingen, Herbertshofen, Ostendorf, Langenreichen and Waltershofen became a part of Meitingen.

It is considered to be the first Indian movie to be remade in 9 other languages - which is also the highest for any Indian movie. The film also has the distinction of receiving most Filmfare awards (nine) by any South Indian film. Plot Santosh (Siddharth) is a rich city boy born to millionaire parents Janaki (Geetha) and Prakash (Prakash Raj) and brought up in London. On the other hand, Siri (Trisha) is a traditional, simple, rural girl from Andhra Pradesh who is brought up by her only brother Sivaramakrishna (Srihari). He is heartbroken when their father marries another woman and throws them out of the house, humiliating them on the way. Their mother dies, and her tomb is built on the small land which they, own until the Zamindar Narasimha (Narsing Yadav) tells them that it is his land, since their mother had taken a loan from the man. Sivaramakrishna volunteers to work day and night to pay off the loan, as long as they don't tear down his mother's tomb. Narasimha agrees, and the local station master (Paruchuri Venkateswara Rao) helps them. Slowly, Sivaramakrishna and Siri grow up. One day, Lalitha (Veda Sastry), Siri's best friend and Santosh's cousin, comes to their house to invite Siri to their house as she is getting married. Santosh also arrives on the same day with his parents. Slowly, Santosh and Siri fall in love, but Janaki does not bear it as Siri is not as rich as them, and is thus not to their standards. Santosh is also to be married to Janaki's elder brother Srinivasa Rao's (Tanikella Bharani) business partner's (Jaya Prakash Reddy) daughter Dolly (Nanditha). Janaki humiliates Siri as well as Sivaramakrishna, who arrives a minute before, and both are thrown of the house after Janaki accuses them of trying to entice and trap Santosh. When Santosh learns of this, he goes to Siri's house and pleads to her brother to accept him. Sivaramakrishna gives him a chance, just like he was given a chance by Narasimha when he was little. Santosh is tasked to take care of the cows, clean up after them, and grow more crops than Sivaramakrishna by the end of the season; if he does not, Santosh will be thrown out of the village and can never see Siri again. Narasimha and his son (Ajay) are not happy as Narasimha's son wanted to marry Siri. With them, Dolly, and her father trying to get Santosh to lose the competition, Santosh has to work hard for his love, eating red chillies and rice everyday, even though he can't bear it. Through many antics from Narasimha's and Dolly's side, Santosh eventually proves his love for Siri to Sivaramakrishna, and succeeds in growing more grains. However, Narasimha and his son kidnap Siri and then try to rape her. A fight takes place in which Santosh kills Narasimha's son while Sivaramakrishna violently defeats Santosh's uncle's business partner and Narasimha. After realizing that Santosh and Siri should be together, Sivaramakrishna takes the blame for this murder and spends five years in prison. The movie ends with Sivaramakrishna's release from prison, which is also when Siri and Santosh get married, in everyone's presence.

She wrote several books for both popular and scientific audiences and conducted extensive fieldwork on Lemurs in Madagascar, primarily at the Berenty Reserve, a small private reserve of gallery forest set in the semi-arid spiny desert area in the far south of Madagascar. Biography Born Alison Bishop in Ithaca, New York, she held a BA from Cornell University, and a PhD from Yale University; she had been a researcher at the New York Zoological Society, Cambridge University, University of Sussex, Rockefeller University, and Princeton University. In 1998 she was made Officer of the National Order of Madagascar (Officier de l'Ordre National, Madagascar). At the time of her death she was a Visiting Scientist at the University of Sussex. Under her maiden name, she first published \\"Control of the Hand in Lower Primates\\" in 1962. Jolly began studying lemur behavior at Berenty in 1963 and was first to propose female dominance in a primate society. She encouraged field studies that contributed to knowledge about Malagasy wildlife and advised many researchers; she briefed Jane Wilson-Howarth and colleagues before their first expedition to Madagascar in 1981. Since 1990 Jolly had returned for every birthing season to carry out research assisted by student volunteers. She focused on ring-tailed lemur demography, ranging, and especially inter-troop and territorial behavior, in the context of the fivefold difference in population density from front to back of the reserve. Her scientific books include Lemur Behavior: A Madagascar Field Study, The Evolution of Primate Behavior and Lucy's Legacy: Sex and Intelligence in Human Evolution. Her non-technical works include Madagascar: A World Out of Time and Lords & Lemurs: Mad Scientists, Kings With Spears, and the Survival of Diversity in Madagascar. She also wrote numerous articles for consumer magazines and scientific journals. Jolly was the author of two series of children's books‚ÄîThe Ako Books and The Fiddle Stories.  Eponym  Jolly's Mouse Lemur area In June 2006, a new species of mouse lemur, Microcebus jollyae, was named in Jolly's honor.  Personal life  The daughter of the artist Alison Mason Kingsbury and the scholar and poet Morris Bishop, in 1963 Alison Jolly married Richard Jolly, the development economist.\\"Alison Bishop, Zoologist, Wed to Arthur Jolly\\", New York Times, 20 October 1963.

Early development of the game was done by Brown University, in collaboration with the University of Southern California, under a grant from the National Science Foundation. The game is designed to teach immunology to high school students, although later versions will cater to college aged students as well. The game was officially released in May 2008, and is freely available for download. Game summary The protagonist of Immune Attack is a teenaged prodigy in the near-future with a unique immunodeficiency in which the immune system is \\"present, yet non- functional\\" - as if all the immune cells have forgotten what to do. The hero decides to take matters into her own hands, and allies herself with a team of scientists to create a nanobot with the abilities to teach cells how to fight bacterial and viral infections. The player assumes the role of a pilot remote- controlling the nanobot Explorer. With the help of advisors, the player must learn about the different cells and environments in the human body in order to determine how to train the immune system. Visual and audio clues in the game provide the information needed to accomplish this goal. Each subsequent level of Immune Attack features a different infection, and a different cell type the player must train. Cells trained on previous levels are available for deployment as well, allowing the user to make use of a wide range of agents to accomplish their mission. Immune Attack was evaluated in 5th grade though 12th grade classrooms across the US from 2009 through 2013. A research paper was published in 2014 by Dr. Melanie Stegman, the Director of the Learning Technologies Program at the Federation of American Scientists (FAS). In 2014, Stegman was asked by FAS to take the Learning Technologies Program away from FAS, as FAS was interested in focusing on nuclear non proliferation and secrecy. Stegman started a company called Molecular Jig Games and is working on making commercial quality video games that continue to teach serious molecular cell biology. Melanie Stegman's research demonstrates that learning games can teach the terms and abstract concepts of molecular cell biology.Stegman, Melanie (2014).

The player controls the title character, who attempts to consume all of the wafers while avoiding four ghosts that pursue him. Eating flashing wafers at the corners of the screen will cause the ghosts to turn blue and flee, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points. The game was programmed by Tod Frye, taking six months to complete. Anticipating high sales, Atari produced over 1 million copies for its launch and held a \\"National Pac-Man Day\\" on April 3, 1982 to help promote its release. It stands as the best-selling Atari 2600 game of all time, selling an estimated 7 million copies and becoming the best-selling video game of all time during its release. Despite its commercial success, Pac-Man was lambasted by critics for poor visuals and sound, and for bearing little resemblance to the original game. It is often considered one of the worst video games ever made and one of the worst arcade game ports released. Gameplay Pac-Man is a variation of the original arcade game, which was released by Namco in 1980. It features similar‚Äîbut not identical‚Äîgameplay. The player uses a joystick to control Pac-Man, navigating him through a maze of consumable dashes called Video Wafers, opposed by a quartet of multi-colored ghosts. The goal of the game is to consume all the wafers in each level in order to proceed to the next level. The score from each level is then combined to a total, with the aim of achieving the highest possible score. The four ghosts roam the maze, trying to kill Pac-Man. If any of the ghosts touches Pac-Man, he loses a life; when all lives have been lost, the game ends. Each game starts with four lives, and the player is awarded a bonus life upon successful completion of each level, up to a maximum of nine lives in reserve at any given time. Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing consumables known as Power Pills that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the ghosts and earn bonus points. When a Power Pill is in effect the enemies turn blue and try to evade Pac-Man. When a ghost is eaten its disembodied eyes return to the nest (center box) to respawn. The blue ghosts turn reddish during the last moments of a Power Pill's effect, signaling that they are about to become dangerous again, and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one level to the next, becoming shorter as the game progresses. The final consumable items are the Vitamins, which appear periodically directly below the nest. The game has eight variations, offering two different starting speeds for Pac-Man and four speeds for the ghosts. The ghosts get slightly faster each subsequent round, but Pac-Man stays at the same speed. The console's A‚ÄìB difficulty switches can also be used to handicap one or both players: in the A (hard) position, the power pills' effects do not last as long. = Differences from the original = Overall the game follows the format of the original, but it differs in a number of key respects, including a landscape orientation of the screen, that the wraparound Warp Tunnel is located at the top and bottom as opposed to the sides. The maze layout and overall color scheme also differ from the original. Pac-Man himself features an eye and he only faces left and right, never turning to face up or down when traveling in those directions. The ghosts' eyes constantly cycle through four directions rather than being fixed in their current direction of travel. The maze contains 126 wafers, just over half of the arcade's 244 dots. The nest from which the ghosts emerge has its entrance on its right side instead of the top, and the arcade's eight distinct and different-valued bonus items (mostly fruits) are replaced by the nondescript single-value Vitamin. Ghost behaviors are different from the original and dispense with the brief \\"rest\\" states whereby the ghosts periodically do not track Pac-Man, but each ghost still features a distinct individual method of tracking Pac-Man, with one pair being \\"smarter\\" in their pursuit choices, and one member of each pair being faster than the other. In the arcade when a ghost is eaten its eyes return to the nest and it respawns and exits immediately in its normal (not vulnerable) state, but in this version the eyes remain in the nest until any Power Pill effects expire before they respawn and reemerge. The scoring for the home version is proportionally identical to the original except that each item is worth 1/10th its arcade value, with the bonus Vitamins as the only variation, being worth 100 points, which is the equivalent of the 1000 point scoring melon bonus item that appears in the 7th and 8th levels of the arcade game. Unlike the arcade version, if Pac-Man loses a life while the vitamin appears, the vitamin may not necessarily be forfeited. This version does not feature the marquee screen and interstitial animations. Neither does it attempt to approximate the sounds of the original, reducing the iconic two note \\"wakka wakka\\" dot eating and bonus gobbling sounds to a single tone clank sound and single beep respectively, replacing the game start tune with a touch-tone phone sounding four-note motif, and dispensing entirely with both the slot machine jackpot type sound signifying earning an extra life and the omnipresent siren sound during gameplay. The most significant and obvious difference is the constant flicker of the ghosts. Development In the late 1970s, Atari acquired the rights to produce home versions of Namco's arcade games. After Pac-Man proved to be a success in the United States, Atari decided to produce the game for its Atari 2600 console. The company believed the conversion would be simple because the arcade's success was attributed to the gameplay rather than impressive visuals. Development took around four months; the process started in May 1981 and finished in September. Programming was assigned to Tod Frye, who was not provided with any arcade design specifications to work from, and had to figure out how the game worked by playing it. He spent 80-hour weeks over six months developing it. The finished game uses a 4KB ROM cartridge, chosen for its lower manufacturing costs compared to 8KB bank-switched cartridges, which recently become available. As with any contemporary arcade port, the simple Atari 2600 hardware was a considerable limitation. The arcade PAC-MAN system board contained 2KB of main RAM (random-access memory) in which to run the program, 2KB of video RAM to store the screen state, and 16KB of ROM (read- only memory) to store the game code, whereas the Atari 2600 featured only 128 bytes of RAM memory and none dedicated to video: effectively 32 times less RAM. The Zilog Z80 CPU microprocessor used by the Namco Pac-Man arcade system is clocked at three times the speed of the MOS 6507 CPU in the Atari 2600 - though the Z80 typically does less work per clock cycle. To deal with these limitations, Frye simplified the maze's intricate pattern of corridors to a more repetitive pattern. The small tan pellets in the arcade original were changed to rectangular \\"wafers\\" that shared the wall color on the 2600; a change necessitated because both the pellets and walls were drawn with the 2600's Playfield graphics, which have a fixed width. To achieve the visual effect of wafers disappearing as Pac-Man eats them, the actual map of the maze was updated as the data was written into the Playfield registers, excluding those pellets that had been eaten. The 2600's Player-Missile graphics system (sprites) were used for the remaining objects, the one bit-wide Missiles were used to render the flashing power pills and the center of the vitamin. Pac-Man and ghost characters were implemented using the 2600's two Player objects, with one being used for Pac-Man and the other being used for all four ghosts, with the result that each ghost only appears once out of every four frames, which creates a flickering effect. This effect takes advantage of the slow phosphorescent fade of CRT monitors and the concept of persistence of vision, resulting in the image appearing to linger on screen longer, but the flickering remains noticeable, and makes each individual ghost's color nearly impossible to discern. Frye chose to abandon plans for a flicker-management system to minimize the flashing in part because Atari didn't seem to care about that issue in its zeal to have the game released. According to Frye, his game also did not conform to the arcade game's color scheme in order to comply with Atari's official home product policy that only space type games should feature black backgrounds. Another quality-impact was his decision that two- player gameplay was important, which meant that the 23 bytes required to store the current difficulty, state of the dots on the current maze, remaining lives, and score had to be doubled for a second player, consuming 46 of the 2600's meager 128-byte memory, which precluded its use for additional game data and features. Oft-repeated stories claim that the company wanted to or did release a prototype in order to capitalize on the 1981 holiday season, however the retail release was a final product. Frye states that there were no negative comments within Atari about these elements, but, after seeing the game, Coin Division marketing manager Frank Ballouz reportedly informed Ray Kassar, Atari's president and CEO, that he felt enthusiasts would not want to play it. His opinion, however, was dismissed. The company ran newspaper ads and promoted the product in catalogs, describing it as differing \\"slightly from the original\\". To help sales, Atari promoted and protected its exclusive licensing of Pac-Man. It took legal action against companies that released clones similar to Pac-Man. Atari sued Philips for its 1981 Magnavox Odyssey¬≤ game K.C. Munchkin! and obtained a preliminary injunction against the company to prevent the sale of Munchkin cartridges, but failed to stop other games, such as On-Line Systems' Jawbreaker and Gobbler. Several retailers assisted Atari with the release of the game. J. C. Penney was the first retailer to launch a nationwide advertising campaign on television for a software title. Continuing a long-standing relationship between it and Sears, Atari also produced Pac-Man cartridges under the department store's label. Reception Anticipation for the game was high. Atari stated in 1981 that it had preorders for \\"three or four million\\" copies of the Atari 2600 version. Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Simon predicted the sale of 9 million units during 1982, which would yield a profit of $200 million. Pac-Man met with initial commercial success, selling 7 million copies and eventually becoming the best-selling Atari 2600 title; Frye reportedly received $0.10 in royalties per copy. More than one million of those cartridges had been shipped in less than one month, helped by Atari's $1.5 million publicity campaign. However, purchases soon slowed and, by the summer of 1982, unsold copies were available in large quantities. Many buyers returned the games for refunds, and Atari was left with 5 million excess copies in addition to the returns. By 2004, the cartridges were still very common among collectors and enthusiasts‚Äîthough the Sears versions were rarer‚Äîand priced lower. Pac-Man must eat the wafers while avoiding the ghosts. The ghosts take turns appearing on the screen, creating a flicker effect that was widely criticized. At release, critics negatively compared the port to its original arcade form, panning the audio-visuals and gameplay. On May 11, 1982, Electronic Games Magazine published its first bad review ever for an Atari video game, saying, \\"Considering the anticipation and considerable time the Atari designers had to work on it, it‚Äôs astonishing to see a home version of a classic arcade contest so devoid of what gave the original its charm\\". Video Magazine admitted it was \\"challenging, and there are a few visual pluses\\", before lamenting, \\"Unfortunately those who cannot evaluate Pac-Man through lover's eyes are likely to be disappointed\\". The premiere issue of Video Games Player from Fall 1982 called Pac-Man \\"just awful\\". In 1983, Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games reviewer Danny Goodman commented that the game fails as a replica of its arcade form: \\"Atari stated clearly in it description of the cartridge that Atari's Pac-Man 'differs slightly from the original'. That, perhaps, was an understatement.\\" Conversely, he stated that such criticism was unfair because the hardware could not properly emulate the arcade game. Goodman further said that the port is a challenging maze game in its own right, and it would have been a success if fans had not expected to play a game closer to the original. That year Phil Wiswell of Video Games criticized the game's poor graphics, mockingly referring to it as \\"Flickerman\\", while Softline questioned why Atari opposed Pac-Man clones when the 2600 version was less like the original \\"than any of the pack of imitators\\". The game has remained poorly rated. In 1998, Next Generation magazine editors called it the \\"worst coin-op conversion of all time\\", and attributed the mass dissatisfaction to its poor quality. In 2006, IGN's Craig Harris echoed similar statements and listed it as the worst arcade conversion, citing poor audio-visuals that did not resemble the original. Another IGN editor, Levi Buchanan, described it as a \\"disastrous port\\", citing the color scheme and flickering ghosts. Skyler Miller of AllGame said that although the game was only a passing resemblance to the original, it was charming despite its many differences and faults. Frye did not express regret over his part in Pac-Mans port and felt he made the best decisions he could at the time. However, Frye stated that he would have done things differently with a larger capacity ROM. Video game industry researchers Nick Montfort and Ian Bogost attribute the poor reception to the technical differences between the 1977 Atari 2600 console and the 1980 arcade hardware used in Pac-Man cabinets. They further stated that the conversion is a lesson in maintaining the social and cultural context of the original source. Montfort and Bogost commented that players were disappointed with the flickering visual effect, which made the ghosts difficult to track and tired the players' eyes. The two further said that the effect diminishes the ghosts' personalities present in the arcade version. Chris Kohler of Wired commented that the game was poorly received upon its release and in contemporary times because of the poor quality. However, he further described the game as an impressive technical achievement given its console's limitations. Impact and legacy Initially, the excitement generated by Pac-Mans home release prompted retail stores to expand their inventory to sell video games. Drugstores began stocking video game cartridges, and toy retailers vied for new releases. Kmart and J. C. Penney competed against Sears to become the largest vendor of video games. The game's release also led to an increase in sales of the Atari 2600 console. In retrospect, however, critics often cite Atari's Pac-Man as a major factor in the drop of consumer confidence in the company, which contributed to the North American video game crash of 1983. Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton of Gamasutra stated that the game's poor quality damaged the company's reputation. Buchanan commented that it disappointed millions of fans and diminished confidence in Atari's games. Former Next Generation editor-in-chief Neil West attributes his longtime skepticism of Atari's quality to the disappointment he had from buying the game as a child. Calling the game the top video game disaster, Buchanan credits Pac-Man as a factor to the downfall of Atari and the industry in the 1980s. Author Steven Kent also blames the game, along with Atari's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, for severely damaging the company's reputation and profitability. Montfort and Bogost stated that the game's negative reception seeded mistrust in retailers, which was reinforced by later factors that culminated in the crash. Millions of unsold copies is one of many reasons that reportedly led to Atari's report of a $536 million loss in 1983 and the division and sale of the company's Consumer Division in 1984. On December 7, 1982, Kassar announced that Atari's revenue forecasts for 1982 were cut from a 50 percent increase over 1981 to a 15 percent increase. Immediately following the announcement, Warner Communications' stock value dropped by around 35 percent‚Äîfrom $54 to $35‚Äîamounting to a loss of $1.3 billion in the company's market valuation. Atari attempted to regain its market share by licensing popular arcade games for its consoles. The revenue from selling these console games did not reverse Atari's decline and the company went further into debt. In 1983, the company decreased its workforce by 30 percent and lost $356 million. In late 1982, Atari ported Pac-Man to its new console, the Atari 5200. This version was a more accurate conversion of the original arcade game and was a launch title for the console, along with eleven other games. The port was also followed by conversions of Pac-Mans arcade sequels, Ms. Pac-Man and Jr. Pac-Man, for the Atari 2600. Both were better received than Atari's first Pac-Man title and addressed many critics' complaints of Pac-Man, but at the cost of excluding a two-player mode and requiring larger ROM cartridges.

He was killed by Ottoman authorities during the Armenian Genocide.  Life  Ruben Zardaryan with Andranik Ozanian, 1915 Zartarian was born in 1874 in the city of Tigranakert (today Diyarbakir), but moved to Harput (or Kharpert) (Armenian: ‘Ω’°÷Ä’¢’•÷Ä’§) when he was two. He received his education from the educational institutions of that city. Zartarian became a student of Tlgadintsi (Hovhannes Harutiunian, 1910‚Äì1912), who was a leading figure in rural Armenian literature. Tlgandintsi was also killed by the Turkish authorities during the Armenian Genocide. Zartarian was greatly influenced by his mentor, and his writing career stemmed from the encouragement he obtained. At the age of 18, he started teaching, and for the following decade, he continued in the field of education. At first, he taught at Tlgandinsti's institution, he then spent three years in French religious institutes. In 1903, Zartarian was arrested by the Turkish government and subsequently forced to leave the country because of his political activity. He established himself in Bulgaria and in 1906, founded a new newspaper called Razmig (Armenian: ’å’°’¶’¥’´’Ø). When writing for the newspaper, Zartarian would often reiterate the need for Armenian nationals living outside their homeland to pursue working towards the ultimate goal of an autonomous Armenia. In 1908, he returned to Constantinople (Istanbul), along with many other Armenian intellectuals. A year later, Zartarian worked for the newspaper Azadamard (Armenian: ‘±’¶’°’ø’°’¥’°÷Ä’ø) while teaching the Central College (Armenian: ‘ø’•’§÷Ä’∏’∂’°’Ø’°’∂ ’é’°÷Ä’™’°÷Ä’°’∂). During the Armenian Genocide, Zartarian was taken to Aya≈ü and kept in prison on 5 May and later taken under military escort to Diyarbakƒ±r to appear before a court martial there and was murdered by Cherkes Ahmet, and lieutenants Halil and Nazƒ±m, at a locality called Karaca√∂ren shortly before arriving to Diyarbakƒ±r.Armenian Reporter Online, Article about the edition of Khachig Boghosian's autobiography  Works  Zartarian started writing poems at the age of 11, and his articles were published in many newspapers. In 1910, he released a volume called nocturnal clarity (Armenian: ’ë’°’µ’£’¨’∏’Ω) that was subsequently translated in French. Many of his works were collected by a group called \\"The Friends of Fallen Authors\\" and released as a volume in 1930 in Paris. Zartarian's duties as an editor often hindered his creativity as a writer. He had many responsibilities and he would have surely produced more books had he been free of them. Some of his stories include: *The Petrified (Karatsadznere, Armenian: ’î’°÷Ä’°÷Å’°’Æ’∂’•÷Ä’®), *The Lake's Bride (Dzovagin Harse, Armenian: ‘æ’∏’æ’°’Ø’´’∂ ’∞’°÷Ä’Ω’®), *Flowers, Red Flowers (Dzaghigner Garmir Dzaghigner, Armenian: ‘æ’°’≤’´’Ø’∂’•÷Ä, ’Ø’°÷Ä’¥’´÷Ä ’Æ’°’≤’´’Ø’∂’•÷Ä), *The Injured Hunter (Zarnevadz Vorsorte Armenian: ‘∂’°÷Ä’∂’∏÷Ç’°’Æ ’∏÷Ä’Ω’∏÷Ä’§’®) *The Prisoner's Tear (Prnavorin Artsoonke Armenian: ‘≤’º’∂’°÷Ç’∏÷Ä’´’∂ ’°÷Ä÷Å’∏÷Ç’∂÷Ñ’®) *HomeLove (Dan Ser Armenian: ’è’°’∂ ’Ω’ß÷Ä) All of these narratives are a mixture of ordinary life situations and fiction. Zartarian was able to cultivate this mixture in a new and very interesting way. His poetry usually focused on the beauty of nature. It can almost be said that he was the fore figure in this new genre of the Armenian literature scene.  Writing style  Zartarian was a great figure from the rural Armenian scene. He was a true admirer of beauty and always wrote with a somewhat critical viewpoint. He wrote in Western Armenian and was a true connoisseur of the language. Zartarian's writing style was one of finesse and very delicate depictions. Erukhan described his writing as the cleanest, most opulent and haughtiest of their time. Inspiration was a key element for this author. Zartarian often said that the pages on his desk would remain unfilled until he would feel inspired enough to write. He was never in a rush to write and did not see it as a job, but rather as stimulating work. Being more of poet by nature, Zartarian's works are peppered with poetic influences. His love of poetry contributed significantly to the splendor of his works.

The Swansea docks are located immediately south-east of Swansea city centre. In the mid-19th century, the port was exporting 60% of the world's copper from factories situated in the Tawe Valley.The Image Engineers of Swansea The working docks area today is owned and operated by Associated British Ports as the Port of Swansea and the northern part around the Prince of Wales Dock is undergoing re-development into a new urban area branded the SA1 Swansea Waterfront.  Docks  Schematic of the past and current docks of Swansea Docks which have existed or still exist in the complex include:GENUKI: Swansea Timeline = North Dock = The North Dock was created to fulfil the increasing shipping demands from the nearby metals industry. The North Dock was created by diverting the River Tawe by cutting a new direct course within a meander section near the estuary. The old course of the River became the new dock and work was completed in 1852.Retired Section Swansea Docks - A Brief History of Swansea Dock Secluded and poorly lit, the area around North Dock was popular with prostitutes and their clients, until lighting was improved following the drowning of Selina Rushbrook in the lock gate in 1907. The North Dock closed in 1930 after the development of new larger docks on the east side of the River Tawe made the North Dock obsolete. The north dock has since been filled in and the Parc Tawe retail complex was built on the site in the late 1980s. = South Dock = Construction began on the South Dock in 1852 by a private company. It was built on a site west of the River Tawe, just south of the North Dock and was not completed until 1859. The South Dock was closed in 1971 and was redeveloped in the 1980s. The dock itself became the Swansea Marina and the land around the dock was developed as the Maritime Quarter residential area. = Prince of Wales Dock = Prince of Wales Dock, April 2011 The Swansea Harbour Trust began constructing the Prince of Wales Dock in 1879 on Fabian's Bay to the east of the River Tawe. When construction was completed, the Prince of Wales dock was opened on 18 October 1881 by Edward, Prince of Wales, and extended in 1898 to its present size of . Usage of the Prince of Wales dock declined throughout the latter half of the 20th century. The Prince of Wales Dock is now being redeveloped as the Prince of Wales Marina with 500 berths. A new channel with sea lock and holding basin is currently under construction to link the Prince of Wales Dock directly with the River Tawe.Lewis and Lewis: Portfolio - SA1 Swansea Sea Locks and Communication Channel A new wakeboarding facility opened in the Prince of Wales Dock in 2010.Wakeboarding craze is set to splash down into Swansea = King's Dock = Work began on the King's Dock in 1905 to meet the growing demand of Tinplate exports from the local area. The King's Dock was constructed as a much larger dock than the Prince of Wales on the south side of the Prince of Wales Dock and covers some 72 acres (29 ha). Construction was complete by 1909. The King's Dock is the principal dock in the Port of Swansea which is still in use today for cargo operations. = Queen's Dock = At the same time as the King's Dock was being built, a breakwater was constructed further south of the King's Dock which enclosed a large body of water covering some 151 acres (61 ha).Hutchisong Encyclopedia article about Swansea This body of water was opened in 1920 as the Queen's Dock after oil handling facilities were built to handle imports for the nearby BP oil refinery at Llandarcy and petrochemical plant at Baglan Bay. Usage of the Queen's Dock reached its peak in the 1950s when oil imports and exports reached around 8 million tonnes per year. Since the closure of the oil plants at Baglan Bay and Llandarcy, the Queen's Dock was rendered obsolete as an oil handling facility. The Queen's Dock is now used for mussel farming.This is South Wales - Turning a rope trick into a thriving new business  History  Entrance to Swansea harbour, Glamorganshire, 1830 Due to increases in industrial output and in trade in copper, zinc, iron and tinplate combined with the developments in shipping (big steamships were replacing smaller sailing vessels) by the late 19th century, Swansea's harbour was in desperate need of expansion. The Swansea Harbour Trust (SHT) commissioned the construction of the Prince of Wales Dock, the first on the east side of the river. Opened in 1881 by the Prince and Princess of Wales (later Edward VII and Queen Alexandra), it was completed in 1882 and expanded in 1898. The North Quay frontage was let to the Great Western Railway, the Neath and Brecon Railway and the Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway, which linked the Dulais Valley and Rhondda Valley coalfields directly with the docks. In addition to shunting locomotives operated by the SHT, further engines were provided by Powlesland and Mason from 1903 onwards.

A New England native, she currently resides in Austin, Texas. Early life Born in Northampton, Massachusetts, her mother was a piano teacher and her father was a construction worker. Her family soon relocated to Trumbull, Connecticut, where Kacy remained until graduating from high school. Her parents‚Äô passion for music influenced her from an early age. She started playing the guitar soon after seeing John Denver in concert at age 5. She also began taking piano lessons around that time. After graduating high school, she attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst for one semester before dropping out. At 19 she moved out to Los Angeles to try to jumpstart her music career. She played in coffeehouses in and around the Los Angeles area. After two years in Los Angeles, she was struggling with a drug habit and moved back into her parents' house in Connecticut. Career With her life back together, she started a band, Tragic Sam, and produced a few sessions with Billy Rush, the former guitarist for Southside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes. She moved to New York City around 1992 and tried forming a few ensemble groups, without much success. She began waiting tables, while living with then-boyfriend Karl Anderson in a one-bedroom apartment. She devoted whatever free time she had to her music. Realizing New York City was taking a toll on her, she and Anderson (the two now married) opted to move to Texas, hoping for a fresh start. Once in Austin, she played many open mic nights and would often busk on Sixth Street. She signed a deal with the Dallas-based indie label, Carpe Diem and began recording her debut album Anchorless. The album, which was produced by Dave McNair, was recorded with several local musicians. After performing at South By Southwest, Kacy signed a deal with Atlantic Records, which brought her music to a wider audience. The label released Anchorless in 1997, including two new tracks on this release. The album received some critical praise from publications such as Billboard, Vanity Fair and USA Today, but many critics had a lukewarm response to the record. Despite the response from critics, her songs were featured in films such as Anywhere but Here and Three to Tango She went out on tour in support of the record, playing at Lilith Fair and the H.O.R.D.E. festival and opening for artists Chantal Kreviazuk and Marc Cohn. She went into the studio in 2001 and recorded her second album Boys in the Attic, which was shelved by Atlantic. Kacy soon parted ways with Atlantic and took some time off. She spent the next few years writing and found time to record her third album Moodswing. Released in 2003, the album quickly became a favorite in the Austin area. She released another album entitled Tramps Like Us in 2004. She released her latest album, \\"Cave,\\" in the May 2008. In 2010 Kacy joined the band Liars & Saints, which also includes the singer/songwriters Jeremy Nail and Johnny Goudie, and they released an EP in 2011.

He joined the Revolutionary Militia in 1907 and was active in several clashes in Tabriz. After the 1908 bombardment of the Majlis, Bagher Khan along with Sattar Khan marched towards Tehran, however he returned to Tabriz shortly after upon hearing that the city was under attack. On 22 March 1909, Bagher Khan led the Revolutionary Militia to victory in the Battle of Saridag in which the supply routes to Tabriz were opened. In 1910, Bagher Khan was effectively exiled to Tehran. In 1915, he joined the Committee for National Defence and participated in skirmishes with Russian forces before being forced to retreat to Kermanshah. =Death= In November 1916, while wandering near Qasr-e Shirin, he was offered accommodation by a Kurd named Mohammad Amin Talebani. On the same night, Talebani murdered Bagher Khan and his companions, and threw their bodies away nearby.

Kray had taken refuge in the fortress at Ulm; Moreau diverted his army to approach Ulm from the east. Kray had ordered preparation for the destruction of all the bridges across the Danube, including the one at Lauingen. A small group of French captured a foothold on the northern bank of the Danube by Grensheim, and Moreau's forces were able to move against the fortress on both sides of the river.

Charm++ is designed with the goal of enhancing programmer productivity by providing a high-level abstraction of a parallel program while at the same time delivering good performance on a wide variety of underlying hardware platforms. Programs written in Charm++ are decomposed into a number of cooperating message-driven objects called chares. When a programmer invokes a method on an object, the Charm++ runtime system sends a message to the invoked object, which may reside on the local processor or on a remote processor in a parallel computation. This message triggers the execution of code within the chare to handle the message asynchronously. Chares may be organized into indexed collections called chare arrays and messages may be sent to individual chares within a chare array or to the entire chare array simultaneously. The chares in a program are mapped to physical processors by an adaptive runtime system. The mapping of chares to processors is transparent to the programmer, and this transparency permits the runtime system to dynamically change the assignment of chares to processors during program execution to support capabilities such as measurement-based load balancing, fault tolerance, automatic checkpointing, and the ability to shrink and expand the set of processors used by a parallel program. Applications implemented using Charm++ include NAMD (molecular dynamics) and OpenAtom (quantum chemistry), ChaNGa and SpECTRE (astronomy), EpiSimdemics (epidemiology), Cello/Enzo-P (adaptive mesh refinement), and ROSS (parallel discrete event simulation). All of these applications have scaled up to a hundred thousand cores or more on petascale systems. Adaptive MPI (AMPI) is an implementation of the Message Passing Interface standard on top of the Charm++ runtime system and provides the capabilities of Charm++ in a more traditional MPI programming model. AMPI encapsulates each MPI process within a user-level migratable thread that is bound within a Charm++ object. By embedding each thread in a chare, AMPI programs can automatically take advantage of the features of the Charm++ runtime system with little or no changes to the MPI program. Charm4py allows writing Charm++ applications in Python, supporting migratable Python objects and asynchronous remote method invocation. Example Here is some Charm++ code for demonstration purposes: ; Header file () class Hello : public CBase_Hello { public: Hello(); // C++ constructor void sayHi(int from); // Remotely invocable \\"entry method\\" }; ; Charm++ Interface file () module hello { array [1D] Hello { entry Hello(); entry void sayHi(int); }; }; ; Source file () # include \\"hello.decl.h\\" # include \\"hello.h\\" extern CProxy_Main mainProxy; extern int numElements; Hello::Hello() { // No member variables to initialize in this simple example } void Hello::sayHi(int from) { // Have this chare object say hello to the user. CkPrintf(\\"Hello from chare # %d on processor %d (told by %d) \\", thisIndex, CkMyPe(), from); // Tell the next chare object in this array of chare objects // to also say hello. If this is the last chare object in // the array of chare objects, then tell the main chare // object to exit the program. if (thisIndex < (numElements - 1)) { thisProxy[thisIndex + 1].sayHi(thisIndex); } else { mainProxy.done(); } } # include \\"hello.def.h\\"  Adaptive MPI (AMPI)  Adaptive MPI is an implementation of MPI (like MPICH, OpenMPI, MVAPICH, etc.) on top of Charm++'s runtime system. Users can take pre-existing MPI applications, recompile them using AMPI's compiler wrappers, and begin experimenting with process virtualization, dynamic load balancing, and fault tolerance. AMPI implements MPI \\"ranks\\" as user-level threads (rather than operating system processes). These threads are fast to context switch between, and so multiple of them can be co-scheduled on the same core based on the availability of messages for them. AMPI ranks, and all the data they own, are also migratable at runtime across the different cores and nodes of a job. This is useful for load balancing and for checkpoint/restart-based fault tolerance schemes. For more information on AMPI, see the manual: http://charm.cs.illinois.edu/manuals/html/ampi/manual.html  Charm4py  Charm4py is a Python parallel computing framework built on top of the Charm++ C++ runtime, which it uses as a shared library. Charm4py simplifies the development of Charm++ applications and streamlines parts of the programming model. For example, there is no need to write interface files (.ci files) or to use SDAG, and there is no requirement to compile programs. Users are still free to accelerate their application-level code with technologies like Numba. Standard ready-to-use binary versions can be installed on Linux, macOS and Windows with pip. It is also possible to write hybrid Charm4py and MPI programs. An example of a supported scenario is a Charm4py program using mpi4py libraries for specific parts of the computation.

The World of Elephants, Proceedings of the 1st International Congress (October 16‚Äì20, 2001, Rome): 486‚Äì491. Description This island-bound elephant was an example of insular dwarfism, with an adult male specimen MPUR/V n1 measured in shoulder height and weighed about , and an adult female specimen MPUR/V n2 measured in shoulder height and weighed about . P. falconeri's ancestors most likely reached the Mediterranean islands of Malta and Sicily from North Africa or possibly, from northern Europe during a period of Pleistocene maximum. When the sea levels were around lower, that significantly reduced distances and opened land bridges in between the islands and both to and from the mainland. Cultural significance The belief in cyclopes may have originated in P. falconeri skulls found in Sicily. As early as the 14th century, scholars had noted that the nasal cavity could be mistaken for a singular giant eye socket.

Design career Between 1930-1931 Gabriel worked for the Lintas advertising agency in Berlin and between 1931-1933 for Gumaelius in Stockholm. In 1934, they opened a graphic-design studio in Riga, Latvia, but the following year they immigrated to Palestine. The brothers arrived during the Fifth Aliyah. They established the Shamir Brothers Studio on Rothschild Boulevard in Tel Aviv and began to design posters. In 1935, the Shamirs co- founded the Society of Hebrew Graphic Artists in Eretz Israel. The Coat of arms of Israel designed by the Shamir Brothers Because there were few Hebrew typefaces at the time, the Shamirs improvised hand-painted Hebrew letters, often into transliterated words from European languages and English. Whereas Franz Kraus, the Austrian graphic designer who arrived in Eretz Israel a year before the Shamirs, adhered to a uniform type style, the brothers sought typography that they felt expressed the subject matter. The Shamir brothers, enthusiastic about the establishment of the Jewish state, undertook to formalize and actualize the visual symbols of Israeli sovereignty and independence. They designed the state's emblems, medals, stamps, and currency notes, including the 1949 Israeli State Coat of Arms (an image of a menorah and olive branches). In addition, they advertised cigarettes and other consumer goods, as well as designed stamps for countries in Africa, Asia, and South America. Their posters, other advertisements, and logos from 1935 to the close of their studio in 1974‚Äîrendered for the lottery, marketing fairs, land settlement, support of the army, food rationing, anti-black-market drives, and other nationalistic efforts‚Äîexpress a hyped Communist attitude, but not extreme or dour as in the propaganda of Bolshevik Russia.

Heavily forested, Shubie Park is roughly linear in shape as it is bounded on the north and west by Highway 118 expressway and on the south and east by Lake Micmac and the southern edge of Lake Charles. A portion of the abandoned Shubenacadie Canal passes through the park, from which the park takes its name. The main soil is a well to excessively drained stony sandy loam podzol of the Halifax Series.http://sis.agr.gc.ca/cansis/publications/surveys/ns/ns13b/index.html Soil Survey of Halifax County Nova Scotia The land comprising Shubie Park was part of a larger estate called \\"Countryview\\" that had been established in 1722 as the King's wood lot, providing masts for the Royal Navy. In 1783, the Countryview estate became the first royal land grant in Dartmouth, issued by King George III to naval mast maker Samuel Greenwood. Since then, the land has exchanged hands several times, and in recent decades became home to industry including a rock quarry, asphalt plant and construction and demolition dump. At the time that Highway 118 was extended through the area on the northwest side of Lake Micmac during the 1960s-1970s, the remaining undeveloped land of the Countryview Estate bordering the greenbelt between the highway and lake was set aside as a municipal park for the City of Dartmouth. The municipality developed the park primarily as a green space, although an area bordering Lake Charles was established with a beach, day use picnic area and campground - all operated since a 1996 municipal amalgamation by the Halifax Regional Municipality.Shubie Park Canal Shubie Park contains trails and an interpretive area called the Fairbanks Centre next to the canal at the location of a series of locks between Lake Micmac and Lake Charles. The Fairbanks Centre features a scale model of canal lock mechanisms and various displays. The wooded trails of the Shubie Canal Park follow a remaining section of the canal and include part of the Trans-Canada Trail.

Established in 2001, it is now one of Iran's leading private banks and also the first private bank to be established since the Iranian revolution in 1979. History The Karafarin Bank was initially established as the Karafarinan Credit Institute. It is the first truly privately owned bank in Iran established since the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Its shareholders are among the leading industrialists and contractors in Iran. Many of them are members of the Association of Industrial Managers of Iran, Association of Construction Engineers of Iran, Association of Utility Engineers, and Consulting Engineers and Architects. Many of Karafarin's shareholders have a long history of contributing to the Iranian economy, its development and growth and creating employment opportunities, and that is where the name comes from (Karafarin in Persian means job creator; another possible suggestion for the meaning for the word is also entrepreneur). With an initial capital of 30 Billion Rials, the Credit Institute received its operating permit from the Central Bank of Iran on December 1, 1999. About 85% of the capital was contributed by the founding shareholders and the balance was offered to the general public, which was taken up within days. The Institution was incorporated on December 9, 1999 (equivalent to 18/9/1378 in Iranian calendar) under registration number 157915. Pursuant to the approval by the Extraordinary General Assembly of the Shareholders dated February 15, 2000 (26/11/1379), and the preliminary agreement of the Supervision Department of the Central Bank on September 22, 2001 (31/6/1380), the process of converting the Credit Institute into a bank began. New articles of association was adopted; the paid-up capital was increased in two stages to 200 Billion Rials (just over $25 million); and, shares of those shareholders who did not take advantage of their primitive rights (with respect to the seasoned equity offering) were sold to new shareholders. The Institution was officially converted into a bank on January 1, 2001 (11/10/1380), thus creating the first privately owned bank since 1979. Branches As of December 2011 the bank had 108 branches within Iran as follows: # Central Branch # Keshavarz Blvd. Branch # Isfahan Branch # Farmaniye Branch See also *Banking in Iran References External links * Official Website Category:Banks of Iran Category:Banks established in 2001 Category:Companies listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange Category:Iranian companies established in 2001 ","title":"Karafarin Bank"},{"id":"5656953","text":"Leo of Galicia may refer to: * Leo I of Galicia, king of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia (1269‚Äì1301), also known as Lev Danylovich * Leo II of Galicia, the last Ruthenian king of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia (1308‚Äì1323), also known as Lev Yuriyovych ","title":"Leo of Galicia"},{"id":"5656960","text":"Seal of the university The University of St. Martin (USM) is a university in Philipsburg, Sint Maarten founded in 1989.

Mammoth taxonomy was simplified by various researchers from the 1970s onwards, all species were retained in the genus Mammuthus, and many proposed differences between species were instead interpreted as intraspecific variation. The name Archidiskodon meridionalis is retained by some russian researchers. =Evolution= The earliest known members of Proboscidea, the clade which contains modern elephants, existed about 55 million years ago around the Tethys Sea. The closest known relatives of the Proboscidea are the sirenians (dugongs and manatees) and the hyraxes (an order of small, herbivorous mammals). The family Elephantidae existed six million years ago in Africa and includes the modern elephants and the mammoths. Among many now extinct clades, the mastodon (Mammut) is only a distant relative of the mammoths, and part of the separate family Mammutidae, which diverged 25 million years before the mammoths evolved.Lister, 2007. pp. 18‚Äì21 The following cladogram shows the placement of the genus Mammuthus among other proboscideans, based on characteristics of the hyoid bone in the neck: Mammuthus meridionalis Since many remains of each species of mammoth are known from several localities, it is possible to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the genus through morphological studies. Mammoth species can be identified from the number of enamel ridges (or lamellar plates) on their molars: primitive species had few ridges, and the number increased gradually as new species evolved to feed on more abrasive food items. The crowns of the teeth became deeper in height and the skulls became taller to accommodate this. At the same time, the skulls became shorter from front to back to minimise the weight of the head. Skeletal restoration The first known members of the genus Mammuthus are the African species M. subplanifrons from the Pliocene, and M. africanavus from the Pleistocene. The former is thought to be the ancestor of later forms. Mammoths entered Europe around 3 million years ago. The earliest European mammoth has been named M. rumanus; it spread across Europe and China. Only its molars are known, which show that it had 8‚Äì10 enamel ridges. A population evolved 12‚Äì14 ridges, splitting off from and replacing the earlier type, becoming M. meridionalis about 2‚Äì1.7 million years ago. In turn, this species was replaced by the steppe mammoth (M. trogontherii) with 18‚Äì20 ridges, which evolved in eastern Asia around 2‚Äì1.5 million years ago. The Columbian mammoth evolved from a population of M. trogontherii that had crossed the Bering Strait and entered North America about 1.5 million years ago; it retained a similar number of molar ridges. Steppe mammoths replaced southern mammoths in Europe in a diachronous mosaic pattern between 1 and 0.8-0.7 million years ago. Mammoths derived from M. trogontherii evolved molars with 26 ridges 400,000 years ago in Siberia and became the woolly mammoth (M. primigenius). A 2015 study of mammoth molars confirmed that M. columbi evolved from Eurasian M. trogontherii, not M. meridionalis as had been suggested earlier. This was confirmed by a 2016 a genetic study of North American mammoth specimens. Description Size (grey) compared to a human and other mammoths With a shoulder height of about and an estimated weight of , M. meridionalis is one of the largest proboscideans to have ever lived, along with other larger species of mammoth, and the earlier Deinotherium. Another estimate gives a shoulder height of and a weight of . Cranium fossils of the M. meridionalis found in Italy show the length of the skull to be 1.25 - 1.54 meters long, with tusk lengths of 72 - 85 centimetres. It had robust twisted tusks, common of mammoths. Its molars had low crowns and a small number of thick enamel ridges, adapted to a woodland diet of leaves and shrubs; this indicates it lived on a relatively warm climate, which makes it more probable that it lacked dense fur. Mammuthus meridionalis reconstruction Distribution and habitat Complete skeleton in the Museo Nazionale d'Abruzzo, Italy Fossilized plants found with the remains show that M. meridionalis was living in a time of mild climate, generally as warm or slightly warmer than Europe experiences today. Deciduous mixed wood provided its habitat and food, which consisted mostly of tree-browse: oak, ash, beech and other familiar European trees, as well as some that are now exotic to the region, such as hemlock, wing nut and hickory. Complete skeletons are in Stavropol State Museum in Russia, and in L'Aquila National Museum in Italy. Further east, discoveries at Ubeidiya (Israel) and Dmanisi (Georgia) show the early mammoth living in a partially open habitat with grassy areas, though subsisting on scattered trees and shrubs. The microscopic scratches and pits in the dental enamel on the fossils of M. meridionalis suggest that the species was a browser, feeding on any foliage of high-growing plants.

Externally the windows of the servant's semi-basement are visible at ground level. Internally they are too close to the ceiling to have a view. In architecture, a semi-basement is a floor of a building that is half below ground, rather than entirely such as a true basement or cellar. Traditionally, semi-basements were designed in larger houses where staff was housed. A semi-basement usually contained kitchens and domestic offices. The advantage over a basement is that a semi-basement is lighter as it can have windows, albeit interior windows that are often too high to enjoy a view. Historically this was an advantage as the servants, who traditionally inhabited such a floor, would not have the opportunity to waste time by looking out of the window. The feature also has the aesthetic value of raising the ground floor, containing the building's reception rooms higher from the ground in order that they could enjoy better views, and be more free from the damp problems which always arose before the days of modern technology.

Biography Valeria was born in Iesi, in Marche, a region in central Italy. Her earliest work was as a stage actress. She was very young when she acted in an art company, but success came with the movies Gli Italiani si voltano and La Spiaggia. She won the Golden Grolla award for Le soldatesse. She performed on stage in several plays at the Arlecchino Theater (now Flaiano), from Girotondo by Schnitzler and Per un amore a Roma by Patti to Arialda by Testori and directed by Luchino Visconti. In the 1960s she met director Franco Enriquez and left her husband, Aldo Moriconi, for him. After Enriquez's death she loved Vittorio Spiga, a journalist from Bologna, and at her death he was at her bedside. The president of the Italian Republic, Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, nominated her Great Master of the Republic. In 2000 she was the voice for the Pope's comments during the Via Crucis. In 1999 she received the Renato Simoni award. She worked until the end of her life, in spite of a serious illness (bone cancer), but on 7 June 2005 she was forced to stop her theater tour with Ibsen's Ghosts (Gli Spettri).

It evolved in Siberia during the Early Pleistocene from Mammuthus meridionalis. It was the first stage in the evolution of the steppe and tundra elephants and the ancestor of the woolly mammoth and Columbian mammoth of the later Pleistocene. Populations of steppe mammoth may have persisted in northern China and Mongolia as recently as 33,000 years ago. Taxonomy Molar of Mammuthus trogontherii at the National Museum (Prague) There is confusion about the correct scientific name for the steppe mammoth, either Mammuthus armeniacus (Falconer 1857) or Mammuthus trogontherii (Pohlig 1885). Falconer used material from Asian sources while Pohlig worked with fossil remains from Europe and both names appear in scientific publications, adding to the confusion. A first taxonomical overhaul was done by Maglio (1973) who decided that both names were synonyms, armeniacus being the older, hence the preferred name. However, in Shoshani & Tassy (1996) it was decided that the description of Pohlig prevailed, and consequently the correct name for the steppe mammoth is M. trogontherii. It is unclear whether both forms are indeed identical and authors tend to use the name M. trogontherii for European material and M. armeniacus for Asian remains. Several Japanese mammoth varieties from the early Pleistocene have been named, but all are now thought to be synonyms of M. trogontherii. Description Restoration The steppe mammoth had a short skull compared to M. meridionalis as well as a smaller jaw. The males had spiral tusks with a recurved tip that could grow as long as in old bulls; females on the other side had thinner and slightly curved tusks. With several individuals reaching tall at the shoulders, it is smaller than the largest proboscideans ever to have lived (Palaeoloxodon namadicus reached 22 tonnes and shoulder heights of ), but was larger than other mammoths. A skeleton mounted on the Azov Museum reaches at the shoulder, though this figure might be overestimated because the vertebrae have been placed between the tips of the shoulder blades. Another individual represented by a single humerus long found in Mosbach Sande, Germany, is estimated to have an in-the-flesh shoulder height of , weighed between and might be the largest mammoth found yet. Another estimate gives a shoulder height of and a weight of for the species. Discovery Size (green) compared to a human and other mammoths Fossilized teeth are recovered, but skeletal parts are rare. The most complete skeleton of a steppe mammoth yet found was discovered in 1996 in Kikinda, Serbia. It was mounted, and put on display in 2005. The specimen is a female, which was about high, in length and with long tusks. Another quite complete steppe mammoth was excavated in the cliffs of West Runton in Norfolk, UK; it preserves its jaws and teeth but is missing the upper part of its skull. A rare skull found in Auvergne, France, in 2008 will be examined by Dick Mol and Fr√©d√©ric Lacombat in the Mus√©e Crozatier in Le Puy-en-Velay. In 1959 Zhou, M. Z described what he called a new species of mammoth, M. sungari,Zhou, M.Z., 1959. Proboscidea. In: Pleistocene mammalian fossils from the northeastern provinces: 22-34, pls. 6-15. Edited by Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China. that gained recent notoriety as the largest proboscidean due to a tall and long composite skeletal mount based on two individuals found in 1980. However, Wei et al. (2010), who restudied the fossils referred to M sungari, considered this species to be a junior synonym of M. trogontherii. The authors state that some of the fossils are referrable to M. trogontherii, while the others can be referred to M. primigenius, according to morphological characters and measurements.  Evolution  M. trogontherii is derived from Mammuthus meridionalis, the oldest records of the species are known from China, at around 1.8-2 ma in age from the Nihewan Formation near Majuangou, Hebei. Steppe mammoths arrived in North America across Beringia around 1.5 million years ago, giving rise to the columbian mammoth (the ancestor was previously thought to be M. meridionalis but this was due to misinterpretation of tooth wear patterns). Steppe mammoths replaced Mammuthus meridionalis between 1-0.7 million years ago in Europe, in a complex diachronus mosaic pattern. European populations of M. trogontherii experienced a persistent size reduction towards the end of the Middle Pleistocene. A population of M. trogontherii in north east Siberia developed higher tooth plate count after 0.8 mya, reaching M. primigenius morphology by 400,000 years ago. M. primigenius replaced M. trogontherii in Europe around 200 kya. Relict populations of M. trogontherii may have persisted in Mongolia and North China well into the Last Glacial Period, with teeth of M. trogontherii like morphology in Shanxii being dated to 33.858‚Äì24.857 ka BP and Inner Mongolia to c. 33.7 ka BP.

Primary services ABM provides facility services in areas such as electrical and lighting, energy, facility engineering, HVAC and mechanical, janitorial services, landscape and grounds, parking and transportation. ABM's services also include energy efficiency and sustainability such as building improvements, electric vehicle charging stations, and renewable energy solutions. Green solutions designed to help building owners attain LEED and Energy Star certifications are also services that ABM focuses on to assist in lowering energy usage and reducing carbon emissions.  History  =1909‚Äì1944= In 1909, Morris Rosenberg, the company's founder, began cleaning shopkeepers' windows in San Francisco, CA. The company took the name American Building Maintenance in 1913 and acquired Easterday Janitorial Supply Company in 1927. In the 1920s and 1930s, ABM grew its business on the West Coast by offering annual cleaning contracts to businesses. In 1921, ABM became the first janitorial contractor in America to clean a major college campus after contracting to clean Stanford University. When Morris Rosenberg died in 1935, his oldest son Theodore \\"Ted\\" Rosenberg became president and his younger son Sydney joined the company in 1937. Ted purchased an electrical company in that same year and ABM cleaned Navy ships and installed wiring on Water Buffalo amphibious vehicles during World War II. By the end of the war, ABM had grown to 17 offices in the U.S. and Canada. =1945‚Äì1999= ABM‚Äôs growth continued throughout the post-war years and the company went public in 1962 in the over-the-counter market with Ted serving as Chairman and Sydney as CEO. Ted remained involved with ABM until his death in 2010 serving on the Board of Directors and the late Sydney Rosenberg retired as a director in December 1997. In 1965, ABM went from the over-the-counter stock market to being listed on the American Stock Exchange, now known as NYSE Amex Equities.

Text reads: \\"Be on your guard against all who are subordinate to you ... Trust no brother, know no friend, make no intimates.\\" Instructions of Amenemhat (aka \\"Teaching of King Ammenemes I to His Son Sesostris\\") is a short ancient Egyptian poem of the sebayt genre written during the early Middle Kingdom. The poem takes the form of an intensely dramatic monologue delivered by the ghost of the murdered 12th Dynasty pharaoh Amenemhat I to his son Senusret I. It describes the conspiracy that killed Amenemhat,J. P. Allen thinks the outcome of the conspiracy is inconclusive (Allen, op.cit., p.259) and enjoins his son to trust no-one. The poem forms a kind of apologia of the deeds of the old king's reign.Lichtheim, op.cit., p.137 It ends with an exhortation to Senusret to ascend the throne and rule wisely in Amenemhat's stead. Authorship The Instructions may have been authored at Senusret's commandLichtheim, op.cit., p.135 to eulogize his father and legitimize his claim to the throne. Several centuries later, in the New Kingdom Papyrus Chester Beatty IV, the authorship of the poem was attributed to \\"the foremost of scribes\\" Kheti.Ermann, op.cit., p.xxviiH. Lesko thinks it might be possible that this is the same Kheti who wrote The Satire of the Trades. Hans Goedicke adds to his list of works the Instruction of Merikare, a suggestion which did not find favour with everybody. (Lesko, op.cit, p.141) The principal source of this document comes from the Papyrus Millingen which was copied by A. Peyron in 1843. The original is now lost. Wooden tablets with parts of the Instructions dating to the 18th Dynasty and New Kingdom papyrus fragments and ostraca survive.Lichtheim, op.cit., p.136 Content The Instructions open by identifying the author as \\"the late King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Sehetepibre, the son of Re Amenemhat\\" and claim to be Amenemhat's advice to his son on how to maintain his kingship and prosperity. The king then warns his son not to trust anyone, for even those he had helped refused support and explains that he was assassinated by his guard while he was in bed. He briefly describes his provisions for Egypt; his military successes and his building accomplishments are given. The Instructions close with blessings for his son, Senusret, and advice on how he should rule. Impact This manuscript is one of the earliest references to \\"Asiatics\\". Later pharaohs copied parts of older writings to legitimize their deeds. The 25th Dynasty pharaoh Piye copied sections from the Instructions of Amenemhat almost verbatim. The poem was still being read in the fifth century BC, some 1500 years after it was written. Bibliography *Translation in R. B. Parkinson, The Tale of Sinuhe and Other Ancient Egyptian Poems.

(1985) is an American/Italian miniseries in six parts which adapts the narrative in the Acts of the Apostles. Considered as the third and final installment in a TV miniseries trilogy which began with Moses the Lawgiver (1974) and Franco Zeffirelli's Jesus of Nazareth (1977),Erickson, Hal. Plot synopsis for A.D. on Allmovie website. it was adapted from Anthony Burgess's 1985 novel The Kingdom of the Wicked, which was itself a sequel to Burgess's book Man of Nazareth, on which was based Zeffirelli's movie. The title is the abbreviation for Anno Domini (Medieval Latin, \\"In the year of the Lord\\"), as the events occur in the first years of the Christian Era. Plot summary The story tells the life histories about Saint Peter and Paul of Tarsus after the crucifixion of Jesus, and their individual fates in old Rome in the time of the persecution of Christians. Events in the New Testament Book of Acts by Luke and in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius are dramatized and interwoven with the contrasting histories of political intrigues in the public and private lives of the Caesars from Tiberius through Nero related in The Twelve Caesars by Suetonius, together with the fictional drama of the lives of two Jews and two Romans: Caleb the Zealot and his sister Sarah, and Julius Valerius the Imperial Guard and Corinna the patrician woman who has chosen to be a gladiator. After Caleb is condemned to be crucified, his mother is murdered when Roman soldiers carry out Pilate's orders to have Caleb's sisters Sarah and Ruth sent to Sejanus in Rome as \\"gifts\\". Caleb is rescued on the way to execution, and goes to Rome to find them. He enlists as a gladiator, takes the name \\"Metellus\\", meets and falls in love with Corinna, and is trained as a retiarius. Meanwhile, Ruth, grieving, provokes a Roman soldier to kill her during the voyage to Rome, and Sarah is made a slave in Sejanus' household, until he is executed for treason, and she then becomes part of Caligula's household. Tiberius, after ordering the execution of Sejanus, was himself secretly assassinated by Caligula, who has now become Caesar. Julius Valerius, having met Sarah on Sejanus' estate, has fallen in love with her, and when she is put on the slave block to be sold as part of an imperial fund-raising effort he, with the financial help of his parents and additional funds provided by Aquilla and Priscilla, Jewish tent-makers, buys her for himself and frees her to become his wife. Caleb is informed that Sarah is alive, but he is scandalized that she has married a Roman soldier. He meets Valerius and is soon confronted with the fact that he himself loves a Roman woman, now disinherited and disowned by her father. Valerius and Caleb participate in the plot to assassinate Caligula, and the stammering Claudius (found hiding) is hailed as the new Caesar. He expels the Jews from Rome, but Sarah is exempt as the wife of a Roman. Caleb/Metellus and Corinna also remain. Aquilla and Priscilla return to Jerusalem. Soon afterward Claudius is poisoned by Agrippina after having designated her son Nero as successor over his own son Britannicus, and she herself is then killed by order of Nero. Caleb later marries Corinna near her parents' estate under the open sky with \\"only God as the witnessing Rabbi\\". The missionary Paul is arrested and Julius Valerius is tasked with escorting the prisoner to Rome; then 2 years later he is set free. Valerius and Sarah convert to Christ and soon become parents of a daughter they name Ruth. The burning of Rome is used by Nero at the urging of Tigellinus as a pretext to deflect the blame from himself to the Christians. The dramatization of the persecution that follows includes the inverted crucifixion of Peter, the beheading of Paul, and the preparation of Christian children for the arena being dressed in fresh lambskins and led out to be torn to pieces by Roman war dogs. Caleb and Corinna armed with sword, shield, net and trident rush into the arena to fight the dogs to save the children, several of them being killed before the dogs are slain. The crowd is thrilled with the dramatic rescue. During public announcements of more entertainment to come, Valerius enters and grieves over the death of his daughter, only to find afterward that she is still alive and was never in the arena. In grief and rage over Rome's corruption and cruelty, he renounces his military career and his Roman citizenship, and he and Sarah leave Rome. Linus, long-time family friend of Corinna's, having succeeded Peter, and knowing that Corinna cannot have a child of her own, entrusts a child orphaned by Nero's persecution to her and Caleb, charging them to raise the boy in the faith of his parents. They thank him and depart by ship for Jerusalem. They name him \\"Joshua\\".

The name is used for the area stretching from Gillies Creek to the Richmond city limits. The Greater Fulton Hill Civic Association includes Fulton Bottom, part of Montrose Heights and part of Rocketts. Fulton Hill is south of Church Hill and Shockoe Bottom, north of Varina, east of the James River, and west of Sandston. The zip code is 23231. History This Richmond neighborhood was named for Irish-born James Alexander Fulton, who married Eliza Mayo about 1800 and built a large estate atop current day Powhatan Park. In the 17th century the park was once home to Powhatan Village consisting of twelve dwellings. Tradition holds that Christopher Newport and John Smith first met with Parahunt, Powhatan's son, in May 1607 at this point. In the early 18th century, a ferry was established from a property at the bottom owned by Robert to connect the north and south sides of the James River. A neighborhood of low-slung, single-story homes emerged here after the Civil War, and the area was annexed by Richmond from Henrico County in 1905. By the 1960s, the area at the base of the hill bordering Gilies Creek was mostly home to low and middle income African Americans. The housing stock was regarded as rather shabby, and after very severe flood damage in the early 1970s, many residents took Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Act (1970) money and relocated elsewhere in the city. Eventually, the entire Fulton Bottom community was completely demolished, marking Richmond's only neighborhood-wide urban renewal slum clearance. Residents were promised rehabilitation and new construction, but the space once occupied by Fulton lay empty for a full decade before construction of moderate-income housing began. Many regard the failure to replace the razed housing in Fulton as one of the central failures of the city's urban renewal plans. Fulton Hill Today The area above the floodplain is an intact urban neighborhood, with a working class character and population. The area is seeing renovation and rehabilitation on the upswing after years of neglect, thanks in large part to dedicated community action to tackle criminal activity, and also to rising property prices in other parts of the city. Fulton Hill's population is primarily African American, but an increasing number of white residents have purchased homes in the neighborhood in recent years, making the neighborhood one of Richmond's most diverse. Neighborhood businesses, most of which are located along Williamsburg Road, include a Bank of America branch, several convenience stores and service stations, a Family Dollar store, Top Shelf Smoke shop and the popular Krispies Fried Chicken restaurant. It also includes longtime community nonprofit The Neighborhood Resource Center Fulton is home to the east coast hub for Stone Brewing. Fulton Hill has a large stock of early-20th-century vernacular homes, especially 1- and -story bungalows, but also including a number of increasingly trendy Sears Catalog homes and several semi-detached Federal rows that date to the earlier years of settlement. The neighborhood is also home to Richmond National Cemetery, a veteran's cemetery dating to the Civil War with 9,322 interments. An album by the band Alabama Thunderpussy is named \\"Fulton Hill\\" after the community.

He coached Real Madrid, Atl√©tico Madrid, and the Spain national team, winning major trophies with all three. Managerial career =Real Madrid= Villalonga was appointed manager of Real Madrid during the middle of the 1954‚Äì55 season and subsequently coached a team that included Alfredo Di St√©fano, Francisco Gento, Miguel Mu√±oz, Hector Rial and later, Raymond Kopa. During his first season they achieved a double, winning both La Liga and the Copa Latino. In 1956, Villalonga became the first manager to win the European Cup. At 36 years and 184 days at the time, he also remains to date the youngest manager to win the title. During his final season at Real he guided the team to a treble: La Liga/Copa Latina/European Cup. =Atl√©tico Madrid= In 1959, Villalonga became manager at Atl√©tico Madrid. With Villalonga in charge and with a team that included Enrique Collar, Miguel Jones and Adelardo, Atl√©tico defeated Real in two successive Copa del General√≠simo finals in 1960 and 1961. They finished as runners-up in 1961 La Liga. In 1962, they won the European Cup Winners Cup, beating Fiorentina 3-0 after a replay. =Spain= In 1962, Villalonga was appointed manager of Spain. In 1964, the team won the European Championship title. With a squad that included Luis Su√°rez, Francisco Gento, Josep Maria Fust√© and Jos√© √Ångel Iribar, Spain beat Romania, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in the qualifying rounds before hosting the semi- finals and final. In the semi-final, Spain beat Hungary 2-1. In the final, Spain successfully contested the USSR 2-1 in front of a crowd of 125,000 at the Bernab√©u. Jes√∫s Mar√≠a Pereda put Spain ahead after six minutes but a late Marcelino Mart√≠nez header was needed to win after Galimzian Khusainov equalised with a free-kick. Villalonga took Spain to a less successful 1966 World Cup in England. Two consecutive defeats to Germany and Argentina after a 2-1 win over Switzerland left Spain and Villalonga to an early return home. The loss to Germany was his last of 22 games in charge of Spain. Villalonga devoted his time to teaching at the technical level. In 1967, he was appointed director of the National Coaches School, a position he held until his death in 1973, and was the first Teacher of Football in the INEF Madrid. He died in Madrid, as a result of a myocardial infarction on August 7, 1973, at the age of 53.

Hovsepyan. In 1965, a modified version called Nairi-M, and in 1967 versions called Nairi-S and Nairi-2, were developed. Nairi-3 and Nairi-3-1, which used integrated hybrid chips, were developed in 1970. These computers were used for a wide class of tasks in a variety of areas, including Mechanical Engineering and the Economics.  Nairi-3  Of all the models of the Nairi computer systems, the micro-program control principles of the Nairi-1 were improved and expanded on the most in the Nairi-3 models. Through the advances in computer technology since the initial production year of 1964, it became possible for upwards of 128 thousand micro-instructions to be stored at one time. Not to mention the reduction in access times due to advances in the manufacture process of the components. This enabled for a Multilingual Computing structure, and time- sharing modes with simultaneous access of up to 64 terminals; which could all perform the functions of one computer. The processing power of the Nairi-3 was considerably higher than competing systems due to multiple storage system improvements. Some of which includes the usage of a long-term form of read- only memory to store the computer's firmware, on a sampling cycle of 8 Œºs, while on other, similar systems, the firmware as well as external, foreign programs were stored on external storage devices, such as magnetic drums, the predecessor to modern day hard drives. A feature of the proposed computer architecture for a model of the Nairi-3 computer systems was the use of a permanent, non-volatile memory cassette tape, the main functional block of the ROM device was the storage, which consisted of YAN-9 accumulator cells.

It was endemic to North America during the Late Eocene to Early Miocene (46‚Äî16 mya) existing for approximately .Merycoidodon at fossilworks Taxonomy Skull of Merycoidodon culbertsoni Most researchers in paleobiology and paleontology now use the antecedent genus Merycoidodon to refer to this Oligocene epoch oreodont, even though it was once widely known by the younger synonym of Oreodon. Taxonomically speaking, Merycoidodon belongs to the family Merycoidodontidae (once known as \\"Oreodontidae\\"), a group of artiodactyls related to camels that were endemic to North America. Its ancestors date back to the Eocene and its last descendants are known from the end of the Miocene, so that oreodonts, broadly speaking, lived throughout most of the Tertiary era. Morphology Painting from around 1920 Modern restoration of Merycoidodon culbertsoni Merycoidodon would have somewhat resembled a pig in appearance, but had a longer body, at about , and short limbs. The fore limbs had five toes (although the first one was vestigial), while the hind limbs had four. Given the shape of the limbs, it is unlikely that the animals would have been able to run fast. Unlike modern ruminants, they had a full set of teeth, although the molars were adapted for grinding up tough vegetation. Notably, they had strong, and very striking, canines. The skulls of Merycoidodon have a pit in front of the eyes. Similar pits are found in the skulls of modern deer, where they contain a scent gland used for marking territory. Although Merycoidodon was not directly related to deer, it seems likely that it possessed a similar gland, which may imply that it, too, was territorial. Oreodonts lived in large herds and moved about from place to place. They seem to have had a predilection for well-watered regions, where food was plentiful and succulent. The number of fossils found implies that, at one time, oreodonts were as plentiful in South Dakota as zebras are today on the serengeti plains. Fossil distribution Fossils have been uncovered from as far north as Alberta, Canada to Florida, Texas and Oregon in the United States.

He entered Harvard College in the 1960s, started participating in technical theater during his freshman orientation period, and soon found himself spending much more time on technical theater than on his studies. He participated in work on the student level, but also started working with professional companies, particularly the Boston Ballet, for whom he designed low cost portable smoke generators, and the American Repertory Theater. Career In the course of his career, Symonds was a part of the lighting crew at Woodstock. He often told the students he worked with about pouring ice cubes into the spotlights there just to keep them from overheating. He is also responsible for the New England Aquarium's penguin exhibit lighting design, and was a primary consultant in the redesign of the dilapidated theatre which originally housed the Hasty Pudding Theatricals at Harvard University. Symonds focused on lighting and set design, education, and safety. He became well known as an architectural lighting consultant, bringing the McCandless method to lighting spaces not meant for theater. He was a volunteer fireman, and brought that knowledge back into theater production safety. (His \\"fire speech,\\" incorporating exposition of the mathematical relationship between rate of combustion and available oxygen, together with the infamous threat of a lifetime ban should \\"so much as a piccolo\\" be carried during an evacuation, earned him particular notoriety.) Symonds also worked as a freelance theatre consultant for several theatre construction and renovation projects, including the new theatre and scene shop facilities at King Philip Regional High School in Wrentham, MA. His garrulous personal approach to work and his remarkably broad areas of competence earned him a cult following of theater lovers, many of whom moved on to become successful professionals in the fields of theater and film, with great debt to his influence. He was ubiquitous at Harvard, having his hands not only in the productions of the Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club, but also designing lights for the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, being an integral part of the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Players, and giving technical advice to productions staged by the Harvard Law School. In 1995, he founded the Freshman Arts Program, to ensure that students who wanted to practice the arts at Harvard would have ample knowledge of the resources at their disposal. He taught introductory and advanced technical theater to Harvard undergraduates. In 1998, a new position was created for him at Harvard, Technical Director for Harvard College Theatre Programs under the Office for the Arts at Harvard, to acknowledge his absolute essentiality in the Harvard theater environment. Symonds died on June 20, 2006 at age 59, as the result of heart failure.

They currently play in the Birmingham Merit Leagues, having dropped out of Midlands Premier following their relegation from National League 2 South at the end of the 2018-19 season, becoming an amateur club. History =Origins= The club's original name was Birmingham and Solihull RFC, but in 2001 due to the club colours of black, white, red and gold, and the alliteration of the name, the club underwent a large scale rebranding, adopting the alias Pertemps Bees.http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/welsh/4792039.stm The team have since shortened this to Bees. Birmingham Bees are remembered by many fans for their cup success of 2004, in which they caused the biggest upset in the professional rugby era by beating London Wasps 28‚Äì24 in the quarter-final of the Powergen Cup overcoming odds of 250‚Äì1, known as \\"The Greatest Ever Sporting Upset\\", subsequently playing Newcastle Falcons in the semi-final, live on BBC television. The club however hit rock bottom just two seasons later in 2005‚Äì06 when they finished last in National Division One but were saved from relegation because of league expansion. In October 2006 it was announced that Bees were in the planning stage of building a ¬£60 million super stadium at their training ground known as Portway just off the M42 in Solihull. It would be one of the nation's largest sports villages to rival anything built for the 2012 Olympics. Plans included a regional sports academy, education and conference centre, 12,000 capacity stadium, seven all- weather rugby pitches, archery and shooting ranges and a watersports lake. In June 2007 Bees coach Steve Williams left the club with one year still left on his contact to become assistant manager at Magners League side Ulster. Williams, a former Northampton and London Irish player, won 29 caps for Wales. The 2007‚Äì08 season began under a split coaching structure in which two former England Sevens internationals had equal control over the squad. Ben Harvey coached the backs and Russell Earnshaw was player/forwards coach. The coaching structure however was widely viewed as unsuccessful and former Bees scrum-half Harvey was sacked shortly before Christmas. On a temporary basis former Rotherham head coach Andre Bester was appointed to take charge of the side before being replaced by former Wales A coach Allan Lewis. In November 2007 it was announced that Bees would sell their Sharmans Cross Road pitch and play at local football side Solihull Moors Damson Park as part of a ground share arrangement. On 28 January former Llanelli centre Allan Lewis was announced as the head coach of Bees. Lewis brought experience to the club after previously holding the role of head coach at Celtic Warriors, Moseley, Newport and Bridgend. Lewis had also worked with the Welsh national squad working as selector, backs coach and Wales A head coach at different times throughout his career. However, by 17 April it was reported that Lewis would not remain at the club past the 2007‚Äì08 season and would return to his post at Hartpury College. Bees were relegated to National Division Two at the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season finishing in 15th position. Following their relegation they would also end the clubs association with the Pertemps Group losing the moniker of 'Pertemps Bees' and changing back to the original name of 'Birmingham & Solihull'. Birmingham and Solihull finished the 2008‚Äì09 season as winners of National Division Two and were promoted to the newly formed Championship. Fly half Mark Woodrow finished as top point scorer within the National Leagues and winger Simon Hunt as top try scorer. Sharmans Cross Road Sharmans Cross Road was their ground until May 2010. The ground is named after the road it lies off in Solihull, West Midlands. A stand was purchased from Worcester Warriors in 2005. T In Summer 2010, the Bees left Sharmans Cross Road and moved to local football side Solihull Moors F.C. Damson Park in a ground share arrangement. The Sharmans Cross Road ground is currently unused. In 2014 the former clubhouse at the ground, called the Arden Club, was damaged by fire. Portway Stadium In October 2006 plans were revealed to Bees members for a new multi-purpose ¬£60 million stadium to be built at Birmingham & Solihull R.F.C.'s training ground- Portway. However progress stalled due to Portway being under the jurisdiction of Stratford District Council whereas the Bees are a Birmingham and Solihull club. =A new beginning= Bees' campaign in the 2009‚Äì10 season was blighted by administration. Bees finished the main season on negative points, rat the bottom of the table. However a mini-league of the bottom four teams was played to decide relegation. Unfortunately, due to an administration error back in January, Bees started the play-off league on ‚àí2 points. Yet despite Bees turned were able to retain their position in the league and avoid relegation However, their stay in English rugby union's second tier was not confirmed until 26 May 2010, when the RFU published a Press Release confirming that Bees had passed an audit of their finances and business plan ‚Äì and were accepted as full members of the union.

His feast day is June 22.Roman Martyrologium Life All that is definitely known of Eusebius is gathered from the letters of Basil the Great and of Gregory Nazianzen, and from some incidents in the \\"Ecclesiastical History\\" of Theodoret.Reynolds, H. R., \\"Eusebius, bishop of Samosata\\", A Dictionary of Early Christian Biography, (Henry Wace, ed.), John Murray, London, 1911 In 361 he became bishop of the ancient Syrian city of Samosata. Eusebius had been entrusted with the official record of the election (360) of Bishop St. Meletius of Antioch, who was supported by the Arian bishops, who were under the mistaken notion that he would prove sympathetic to their cause.Ott, Michael. \\"St. Eusebius.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 6 Apr. 2013 When Meletius expounded his orthodoxy, the bishops persuaded the Roman emperor Constantius II, a staunch Arian, to extort the record from Eusebius and destroy it. Constantius threatened Eusebius with the loss of his right hand because he refused to surrender the record, but the threat was withdrawn when Eusebius offered both hands.Butler, Alban. Lives of the Saints, Vol. Vi, 1866 It was chiefly due to the concerted efforts of Eusebius and St. Gregory Nazianzen that, in 370, St. Basil was elected Archbishop of C√¶sarea in Cappadocia. During the persecution of orthodox Christians under Julian the Apostate, Eusebius travelled incognito through Syria, Palestine and Phoenicia disguised as a military officer, ordaining presbyters and deacons. Orthodox Christians experienced a short respite during the brief reign of Jovian, but in 374 the emperor Valens, an Arian, banished Eusebius to Thrace, in the Balkan Peninsula.\\"Hieromartyr Eusebius the Bishop of Samosata\\", Orthodox Church in America Bishop Eusebius asked the messenger to keep the imperial order confidential saying: ‚ÄúIf the people should be apprized, such is their zeal for the faith, that they would rise in arms against you, and your death might be laid to my charge.‚Äù Although advanced in years, Eusebius left that evening.\\"Eusebius, Bishop of Samosata\\", Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America After the Emperor's death in 378, Eusebius was restored to his see of Samosata.

The game simulates snowboarding. Gameplay Dark Summit's controls resembles many other skateboarding and snowboarding games of the time. The user is able to grind/jib, grab, flip (both horizontal and vertical) and do special tricks on the mountain in general and special half-pipe tricks on the alien halfpipe and the chairlift halfpipe. Different areas in this game are accessed by chairlift, and unlocked by having a certain amount of \\"Lift Points\\" which are earned by doing missions. Cosmetics and snowboard upgrades are unlocked by having \\"Equipment Points\\". These are earned by doing tricks around the mountain. Special tricks and combos earn more \\"Equipment Points\\". \\"Lift Points\\" and \\"Equipment Points\\" are not spent as such, they are actually accumulated and for every milestone, the player unlocks a new cosmetic, snowboard upgrade or new area. There are 4 different snowboards in the game that players can unlock by earning \\"Equipment Points\\". The starting boards offers no advantage over the others, and will quickly obsolete to the user. Only very skilled players can use the starting board in the late game, as jumps and tricks are difficult to accomplish quickly. The next board allows the player to navigate quickly and perform jumps easier, making it easier for the user to get down the mountain faster. The third board offers the previous upgrade, as well as the ability to do grabs, flips and spins faster, making combo-trick missions easier to accomplish. Finally, for 2,000,000 equipment points, the player will unlock the final board. This board is by far the best in the game, offering faster speeds, higher jumps, faster grabs and faster spins. Reception The game received \\"average\\" reviews on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

Early life She was born the daughter of Elias Diettrich, a Lutheran minister, in Rohnstock (now Roztoka), in former silesian Duchy of Jawor on December 26, 1636. Her father died in 1650, when she was aged fourteen. In 1655, she married Christian Siegemund, an accountant, but the marriage was childless. However, it lasted for forty-two years, and Christian Siegemund provided considerable support to his wife during her professional career, although they may have lived apart from 1673. Siegemund's childlessness should have technically disqualified her from her profession, as only childbearing midwives were supposed to be able to practice. the capital of the Duchy of Jawor - view of one of the streets. Early career: 1656‚Äì1672 At twenty, Justine Siegemund suffered considerably at the hand of incompetent midwives who wrongly assumed that she was pregnant. Her experience motivated her to educate herself about obstetrics, and she practiced herself for the first time in 1659, when she was asked to assist a case of obstructed labour related to a misplaced infant arm. Until 1670, she provided free midwifery services to peasant and poor women in her local area, although she also gradually diversified her client base to include women from merchant and noble families. Professional midwife: 1670‚Äì1701 sqq. Titlepage of Siegismundin's textbook Given her thriving midwife practice and expanding client base, Siegemund was called upon when a cervical tumour threatened Luise Duchess of Legnica, which she successfully removed, after male physicians called on her professional services. However, sexist professional animosities were never far away. In 1680, Martin Kerger, her former supervisor, turned on her and accused her of unsafe birthing practices. Unfortunately for Kerger, his own colleagues at the Frankfurt on Oder medical faculty sided with Siegemund instead, and it did not help that Kerger's own statements demonstrated that he lacked her practical experience-based professional knowledge of women's reproductive and infant anatomies and childbirth. His groundless allegations did not affect Siegemund's professional employment opportunities, and in 1670 she was named the \\"city midwife\\" of Legnica/Lignitz. Her expertise and dexterity caught the attention of Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg who appointed her as his court midwife termed the Chur-Brandenburgische Hof-Wehemutter in Berlin in 1683. She also served as royal midwife for Frederick III's sister Marie- Amalie, Duchess of Saxony-Zeitz, and delivered four of her children. At the court of August the Strong, she assisted Saxon Electress Eberhardine to give birth to her son, Frederick August II (1696). At the same time, she attended other births within the Berlin area. While in the Netherlands, Mary II of Orange (1662‚Äì1694) suggested that Siegemund should author a textbook training manual for midwives. Siegemund had probably already started to compile the Court Midwife, however. Siegemund rarely used early pharmaceuticals or surgical instruments within her practice. By the time that she died on November 10, 1705 in Berlin, Justine Siegemund had birthed almost six thousand two hundred infants, according to the Berlin deacon that presided over her funeral. The Court Midwife (1690) Two-handed internal version of a shoulder presentation In 1689, Siegemund travelled from the Hague to Frankfurt on Oder, and submitted her draft manual to the Frankfurt on Oder medical faculty, which approved her medical documentation. She had incorporated embryological and anatomical engravings from Regnier de Graaf (1641‚Äì1673) and Govard Bidloo (1649‚Äì1713), which enhanced its practical utility. From April to June 1689, she protected her intellectual property stake in the volume through gaining printing privileges from the Electors of Brandenburg and Saxony, as well as the Holy Roman Emperor. In Leipzig, she had to endure yet another bout of male professional jealousy when Andreas Petermann (1649‚Äì1703) charged her with similar offences to those that Kerger had already advanced, but given his own comparative professional inexperience, Siegemund once again was able to surmount this challenge to her professional reputation. Based on careful notes that she had made during her deliveries she published an authoritative obstetrical text titled the Court Midwife (actually Die Kgl. Preu√üische und Chur-Brandenburgische Hof-Wehemutter) in 1690. It discusses its topics in the form of a dialogue between Justine (herself) and Christina, a pupil. The Court Midwife was systematic and evidence-based in its presentation of possible childbirth complications, including problems like poor presentations, umbilical cord problems, and placenta previa and their management. In the textbook Siegmundin presented a solution to the delivery of a shoulder presentation, in those days often catastrophic situation leading to the death of the baby and potentially the mother. She worked out a two-handed intervention to rotate the baby in the uterus securing one extremity by a sling. She also is credited (along with Fran√ßois Mauriceau) of finding a method to deal with a hemorrhaging placenta previa by puncturing the amniotic sac. After Siegemund's death, the Court Midwife went through numerous republications, including Berlin (1708), Leipzig (1715,1724), with modifications that included corroborative male gynecological citations and accounts of the Kerger and Petermann cases when it was republished in 1723, 1741, 1752 and 1756.

A home version for the Nintendo Entertainment System, simply titled Astyanax, was released a year after the arcade version. Gameplay =Arcade version= Screenshot of the arcade version The arcade version of Astyanax is set in a fantasy world populated by mythical creatures from Greek and Arab mythology. The game consists of six stages: a forest, a cave, a lake, a lift, a castle and the final battle. Up to two players can play simultaneously with continues allowed at any moment. The first player controls Roche (a blond-haired warrior in blue armor), while the second player controls an unnamed palette swap of Roche in red armor with black hair. The controls consist of an eight-way joystick and three buttons for attacking, jumping or using a thunder attack that covers the whole screen. The player has four health points per life. The player's main weapon is his axe, with a power gauge that fills automatically when the player is not swinging it. When the gauge is filled, the player's axe will be lit on fire, allowing for a stronger attack. This allows the player a choice between faster weak swings or a slow strong one. The player can obtain power-ups by destroying stone pillars such as crystals for points or red jewels for additional health. There's also a blue arrowhead that increases the strength of the player's thunder attack by up to four levels (the player must have at least one arrowhead in stock to perform a thunder attack) and a shield that allows the player to block enemy attacks until it breaks. =NES= Unlike the arcade version, the NES version can only be played by one player. Like in the arcade version, the player has a life gauge, a strength gauge that fills automatically when he is not attacking and a magic gauge for his spells. Also unlike the arcade version, the player can wield other weapons besides the default axe, as well as use different magic spells, which are selected by pausing the game. By picking up a power-up, Astyanax's weapon, the Bash, changes shape from its default axe form into a spear, which can be upgraded again into a sword. The spear has the weakest attack strength, but allows Astyanax to use his magic spells more often by consuming less magic points, while the sword can deal the most damage to enemies, but consumes the most magic points when casting a spell. The player will revert to his previous weapon after losing a life. The player's magic spells consist of a binding spell that temporarily freezes all enemies for a few seconds, a fire blast spell that damages all enemies within range and a thunderbolt spell that damages every enemy on-screen. Each spell consumes a different amount of magic points, with the binding spell consuming the least points, while the thunderbolt consumes the most. Other power-ups include a power supply that extends the length of Astyanax's power gauge (allowing for stronger axe swings), a wing that increases the refill speed of Astyanax's power gauge, potions that restore the player's health and magic and extra lives. Astyanax can also encounter Cutie throughout certain stages, who will offer to either change Astyanax's weapon or refill his magic points. Plot =Arcade= A long time ago, an ugly battle was being waged every day as the world was ruled by demons. The people trembled with fear, with nobody to stand up for them. Until one day, a brave young man received a divine revelation from God and was granted the mythical Fire Axe. His name is Roche. Giving the people courage again, Roche embarks on a journey to the Castle of Algerine in order to defeat the demon overlord Argos and restore peace to the world.Japanese Lord of King flyer (TAFA) =NES= Astyanax is a 16-year-old student from Greenview High School who has been having a recurring dream in which a young woman is calling out for his name. One day, while on his way to class, Astyanax is suddenly transported into another dimension. Astyanax meets the fairy Cutie, who explains that he is in the kingdom of Remlia (a possible mistranslation of Lemuria) and has been summoned to rescue its ruler, Princess Rosebud, who is being held captive by the evil wizard Blackhorn. Armed with the legendary axe Bash, Astyanax sets out on a journey to Blackhorn's lair with Cutie in order to rescue Rosebud. In Blackhorn's castle they fall into a trap and Cutie sacrifices her life to allow Astyanax to fight onward alone. He eventually destroys Blackhorn, and is transported back to Earth by Rosebud. Astyanax wonders if he dreamed his entire adventure until he sees Cutie, who has been reborn as a human. As they embrace, he sees a vision of Rosebud saying this is a reward for their bravery. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed The Astyanax on their January 15, 1990 issue as being the twentieth most- successful table arcade unit of the year. Speedruns The current speedrun record is held by the player Tarbash, who completed the NES version of the game in 15m15s on January 11th, 2020 replacing their previous record of 15m28s on October 8th, 2018.https://www.speedrun.com/Astyanax References External links * *The Astyanax at Arcade History *The Lord of King at Jaleco *Astyanax (NES) at MobyGames Category:1989 video games Category:Aicom games Category:Arcade games Category:Fantasy video games Category:Jaleco games Category:Side-scrolling platform games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Video games developed in Japan ","title":"The Astyanax"},{"id":"5657317","text":"Stade Roumd√© Adjia is a multi-purpose stadium in Garoua, Cameroon.

Starch begins to pile up inside the leaves of plants during times of light when starch is able to be produced by photosynthetic processes. This ability to make starch disappears in the dark due to the lack of illumination; there is insufficient amount of light produced during the dark needed to carry this reaction forward. Turning starch into sugar is done by the enzyme amylase.Spoehr, H. A., and Harold W. Milner. ‚ÄúStarch Dissolution and Amylolytic Activity in Leaves.‚Äù Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, vol. 81, no. 1, 1939, pp. 37‚Äì78. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/984965. Accessed 28 Apr. 2020.  Different pathways of amylase & location of amylase activity  The process in which amylase breaks down starch for sugar consumption is not consistent with all organisms that use amylase to breakdown stored starch. There are different amylase pathways that are involved in starch degradation. The occurrence of starch degradation into sugar by the enzyme amylase was most commonly known to take place in the Chloroplast, but that has been proven wrong. One example is the spinach plant, in which the chloroplast contains both alpha and beta amylase ( They are different versions of amylase involved in the breakdown of starch and they differ in their substrate specificity). In spinach leaves, the extrachloroplastic region contains the highest level of amylase degradation of starch. The difference between chloroplast and extrachloroplastic starch degradation is in the amylase pathway they prefer; either beta or alpha amylase. For spinach leaves, Alpha-amylase is preferred but for plants/organisms like wheat, barley, peas, etc. the Beta-amylase is preferred.

Usage  The amylolytic process is used in the brewing of alcohol from grains. Since grains contain starches but little to no simple sugars, the sugar needed to produce alcohol is derived from starch via the amylolytic process. In beer brewing, this is done through malting. In sake brewing, the mold Aspergillus oryzae provides amylolysis, and in Tapai, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Actual measurements are taken from the parts produced and are used to complete the various test sheets of PPAP. > \\"All customer engineering design record and specification requirements are > properly understood by the supplier and that the process has the potential > to produce product consistently meeting these requirements during an actual > production run at the quoted production rate.\\" Version 4, 1 March 2006 Although individual manufacturers have their own particular requirements, the Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG) has developed a common PPAP standard as part of the Advanced Product Quality Planning (APQP) ‚Äì and encourages the use of common terminology and standard forms to document project status. The PPAP process is designed to demonstrate that a supplier has developed their design and production process to meet the client's requirements, minimizing the risk of failure by effective use of APQP. Requests for part approval must therefore be supported in official PPAP format and with documented results when needed. The purpose of any Production Part Approval Process (PPAP) is to: # Ensure that a supplier can meet the manufacturability and quality requirements of the parts supplied to the customer # Provide evidence that the customer engineering design record and specification requirements are clearly understood and fulfilled by the supplier # Demonstrate that the established manufacturing process has the potential to produce the part that consistently meets all requirements during the actual production run at the quoted production rate of the manufacturing process. Critical elements of the Production Part Approval Process * Design record with all specification * Authorized engineering change number (AECN) * Customer Engineering Approval * Process is defined * Process is documented * Linkages of process are established * Process is monitored, analyzed, and improved based on data * Records are created, maintained, and retained * Validation Test Report * Control Plan * PFD (Process Flow Diagram) * Lab Test Report * DFMEA (Design Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) * PFMEA (Process Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) * MSA Study * SPC (Statistical Process Control) PPAP approval PPAP is a series of documents gathered in one specific location (a binder or electronically) called the \\"PPAP Package\\". The PPAP package is a series of documents which need a formal certification / sign-off by the supplier and approval / sign-off by the customer. The form that summarizes this package is called PSW (Part Submission Warrant). The signature in the supplier certification area of the PSW indicates that the supplier-responsible person (usually the Quality Engineer or Quality Manager) has reviewed this package and that the customer-responsible person (usually a Customer Quality Engineer or Customer Quality Manager) has not identified any issues that would prevent its approbation. The documentation on the PPAP package is closely related to the advanced product quality planning process used during the design and development of new vehicles and component systems to reduce the risk of unexpected failure due to errors in design and manufacture. The PPAP manual is published by the AIAG, and specifies generic requirements for obtaining PPAP approvals. Additional customer specific requirements may be imposed by particular clients (vehicle manufacturers) and incorporated in the purchasing contracts. Details of 'customer specific' requirements may be found on the International Automotive Task Force (IATF) website or supplier portals provided by the vehicle manufacturers. A new website, developed by customer- specific requirements, LLC, has been created to help solve problems associated with the distribution and accessibility of customer-specific requirements. Suppliers are required to obtain PPAP approval from the vehicle manufacturers whenever a new or modified component is introduced to production, or the manufacturing process is changed. Obtaining approval requires the supplier to provide sample parts and documentary evidence showing that: # The client's requirements have been understood; # The product supplied meets those requirements; # The process (including sub suppliers) is capable of producing conforming product; # The production control plan and quality management system will prevent non-conforming product reaching the client or compromising the safety and reliability of finished vehicles. PPAP may be required for all components and materials incorporated in the finished product, and may also be required if components are processed by external sub-contractors. The term ISIR (initial sample inspection report) is being used by German companies like VW and BMW. ISIR form is standardized by Verband der Automobilindustrie e. V., short VDA, a German interest group of the German automobile industry, both automobile manufacturers and automobile component suppliers. The term is also used by some other companies like Hyundai and Kia. In fact, ISIR is like the Warrant and Inspection Report of PPAP document package. PPAP document package includes some other document such as PFMEA, control plan, drawing, MSA, capability data etc. Besides ISIR document, other documents like that of PPAP is normally required by Volkswagen and Hyundai for release of a product and process. The PPAP is like the older ISIR plus a lot more, unless your customer has a specific requirement for using their ISIR within their system. ISIR is a summary of the initial sample being presented at what ever state. The PSW is supported and validated by the ISIR. This does not mean the product being presented is under serial conditions but just states with evidence the current status. PPAP is the confirmation that the product meets the customer requirements for series production. The PPAP will be considered signed when a full PSW is approved by your customer and added to the PPAP folder. The PSW would always be supported with an ISIR but the PPAP is only considered approved when a FULL PSW is endorsed with an ISIR. In essence the PSW and ISIR are part of PPAP or VDA and can even be outside of PPAP in cases such as first off tool parts which should be submitted in most cases with a PSW and ISIR but will not be approved in PPAP until series conditions are met. PPAP elements Example of process flow diagram Below is the list of all 19 elements, and a brief description of them. # Design Records A printed copy of drawing needs to be provided. If the customer is responsible for designing, this is a copy of customer drawing that is sent together with the Purchase Order (PO). If supplier is responsible for designing this is a released drawing in supplier's release system. \\"Each and every feature must be \\"ballooned\\" or ‚Äúroad mapped‚Äù to correspond with the inspection results (including print notes, standard tolerance notes and specifications, and anything else relevant to the design of the part).\\" # Authorized Engineering Change (note) Documents A document that shows the detailed description of the change. Usually this document is called \\"Engineering Change Notice\\", but it may be covered by the customer PO or any other engineering authorization. # Engineering Approval This approval is usually the Engineering trial with production parts performed at the customer plant. A \\"temporary deviation\\" usually is required to send parts to customer before PPAP. Customer may require other \\"Engineering Approvals\\". # DFMEA A copy of the Design Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (DFMEA), reviewed and signed off by supplier and customer. If customer is design responsible, usually customer may not share this document with the supplier. However, the list of all critical or high impact product characteristics should be shared with the supplier, so they can be addressed on the PFMEA and Control Plan. # Process Flow Diagram A copy of the Process Flow, indicating all steps and sequence in the fabrication process, including incoming components. # PFMEA A copy of the Process Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (PFMEA), reviewed and signed off by supplier and customer. The PFMEA follows the Process Flow steps, and indicates \\"what could go wrong\\" during the fabrication and assembly of each component. # Control Plan A copy of the Control Plan, reviewed and signed off by supplier and customer. The Control Plan follows the PFMEA steps, and provides more details on how the \\"potential issues\\" are checked in the incoming quality, assembly process or during inspections of finished products. # Measurement System Analysis Studies (MSA) MSA usually contains the Gauge R&R; for the critical or high impact characteristics, and a confirmation that gauges used to measure these characteristics are calibrated. # Dimensional Results A list of every dimension noted on the ballooned drawing. This list shows the product characteristic, specification, the measurement results and the assessment showing if this dimension is \\"ok\\" or \\"not ok\\". Usually a minimum of 6 pieces is reported per product / process combination. # Records of Material / Performance Tests A summary of every test performed on the part. This summary is usually on a form of DVP&R; (Design Verification Plan and Report), which lists each individual test, when it was performed, the specification, results and the assessment pass / fail. If there is an Engineering Specification, usually it is noted on the print. The DVP&R; shall be reviewed and signed off by both customer and supplier engineering groups. The quality engineer will look for a customer signature on this document. In addition, this section lists all material certifications (steel, plastics, plating, etc.), as specified on the print. The material certification shall show compliance to the specific call on the print. # Initial Sample Inspection Report The report for material samples which is initially inspected before the prototype is made. # Initial Process Studies Usually this section shows all Statistical Process Control charts affecting the most critical characteristics. The intent is to demonstrate that critical processes have stable variability and that is running near the intended nominal value. # Qualified Laboratory Documentation Copy of all laboratory certifications (e.g. A2LA, TS, NABL) of the laboratories that performed the tests reported on section 10. # Appearance Approval Report A copy of the AAI (Appearance Approval Inspection) form signed by the customer. Applicable for components affecting appearance only. # Sample Production Parts A sample from the same lot of initial production run. The PPAP package usually shows a picture of the sample and where it is kept (customer or supplier). # Master Sample A sample signed off by customer and supplier, that usually is used to train operators on subjective inspections such as visual or for noise. # Checking Aids When there are special tools for checking parts, this section shows a picture of the tool and calibration records, including dimensional report of the tool. # Customer-Specific Requirements Each customer may have specific requirements to be included on the PPAP package. It is a good practice to ask the customer for PPAP expectations before even quoting for a job. North American auto makers OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) requirements are listed on the IATF website. # Part Submission Warrant (PSW) This is the form that summarizes the whole PPAP package. This form shows the reason for submission (design change, annual revalidation, etc.) and the level of documents submitted to the customer. There is a section that asks for \\"results meeting all drawing and specification requirements: yes/no\\" refers to the whole package. If there are any deviations the supplier should note on the warrant or inform that PPAP cannot be submitted. PPAP requirements are typically distinguished by level as follows: * Level 1 ‚Äì Part Submission Warrant (PSW) only submitted to the customer. * Level 2 ‚Äì PSW with product samples and limited supporting data. * Level 3 ‚Äì PSW with product samples and complete supporting data. * Level 4 ‚Äì PSW and other requirements as defined by the customer. * Level 5 ‚Äì PSW with product samples and complete supporting data available for review at the supplier's manufacturing location.

Its population was 403 in the Canada 2016 Census. The village is one of the northernmost inhabited places in Quebec, located on the eastern shore of Diana Bay (Tuvaaluk in the Inuktitut language), on a peninsula which protrudes into the Hudson Strait where it meets Ungava Bay. The name Quaqtaq signifies tapeworm. According to local folklore, this name derives from a man who once came to the area to hunt beluga and found live parasites in his feces. His hunting companions began to call the place Quaqtaq. Inaccessible by road, Quaqtaq is served by the small Quaqtaq Airport. History Archaeological evidence indicates that people have occupied the area around Quaqtaq for about 3500 years. Thule people, the ancestors of today's Inuit, arrived around 1400 or 1500 AD. In 1947, a Roman Catholic mission opened in Quaqtaq. The present-day settlement was established after a trading post first established in 1927 at Iggiajaaq, a few kilometres south-west, was finally closed in 1950. After a measles epidemic killed 11 adults in 1952, the Canadian government began delivering basic services to the community. A nursing station was built in 1963. In the 1960s, the Quebec government opened a store and a post office equipped with a radio-telephone. In 1974, the store became a co-operative and, in 1978, Quaqtaq was legally established as a Northern village. Since 1996, policing is provided by the Kativik Regional Police Force.

A lawyer by training, she worked as a civil law lecturer at Lund University before becoming a full-time politician. She served as Municipal commissioner of Lund 1983-1991, Minister for Justice 1991-1994, member of the Riksdag, chairman of the Riksdag Committee on Justice 1994-2001, President of the Nordic Council 1999, Director General of the Swedish Patent and Registration Office 2001-2007, and chairman of the board of the University of Bor√•s 2004-2007. Laila Freivalds was both her predecessor and successor to the office of Minister for Justice. Hellsvik was known for her tough stance on drugs. She opposed dispensing clean needles to drug addicts, arguing that it would undermine people's confidence in the legal system. As Minister of Justice, she oversaw a legal change that made it a crime to be under the influence of an illicit drug, even in the absence of drug possession; she also authorised the police to forcibly obtain urine and blood samples from a suspected individual. She lauded the American war on drugs, claiming that \\"as so many times before, the United States, is showing us the right path\\". In a motion to parliament entitled \\"Strong measures against narcotics\\" (Krafttag mot narkotika;) she supported lifetime imprisonment for narcotics crimes, allowing the police the take urine and blood samples from small children to promote early detection of drug abuse and to authorise the police to routinely induce vomiting in individuals suspected of having swallowed narcotics, among other things; the proposals were voted down by parliament. Hellsvik died from cancer on 14 November 2016, at the age of 74.

The defining features of AMQP are message orientation, queuing, routing (including point-to-point and publish-and-subscribe), reliability and security. AMQP mandates the behavior of the messaging provider and client to the extent that implementations from different vendors are interoperable, in the same way as SMTP, HTTP, FTP, etc. have created interoperable systems. Previous standardizations of middleware have happened at the API level (e.g. JMS) and were focused on standardizing programmer interaction with different middleware implementations, rather than on providing interoperability between multiple implementations. Unlike JMS, which defines an API and a set of behaviors that a messaging implementation must provide, AMQP is a wire-level protocol. A wire-level protocol is a description of the format of the data that is sent across the network as a stream of bytes. Consequently, any tool that can create and interpret messages that conform to this data format can interoperate with any other compliant tool irrespective of implementation language.  Overview  AMQP is a binary, application layer protocol, designed to efficiently support a wide variety of messaging applications and communication patterns. It provides flow controlled, message-oriented communication with message-delivery guarantees such as at-most-once (where each message is delivered once or never), at- least-once (where each message is certain to be delivered, but may do so multiple times) and exactly-once (where the message will always certainly arrive and do so only once), and authentication and/or encryption based on SASL and/or TLS. It assumes an underlying reliable transport layer protocol such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). The AMQP specification is defined in several layers: (i) a type system, (ii) a symmetric, asynchronous protocol for the transfer of messages from one process to another, (iii) a standard, extensible message format and (iv) a set of standardised but extensible 'messaging capabilities.'  History  AMQP was originated in 2003 by John O'Hara at JPMorgan Chase in London. AMQP was conceived as a co-operative open effort. The initial design was by JPMorgan Chase from mid-2004 to mid-2006 and it contracted iMatix Corporation to develop a C broker and protocol documentation. In 2005 JPMorgan Chase approached other firms to form a working group that included Cisco Systems, IONA Technologies, iMatix, Red Hat, and Transaction Workflow Innovation Standards Team (TWIST). In the same year JPMorgan Chase partnered with Red Hat to create Apache Qpid, initially in Java and soon after C++. Independently, RabbitMQ was developed in Erlang by Rabbit Technologies, followed later by the Microsoft and StormMQ implementations. The working group grew to 23 companies including Bank of America, Barclays, Cisco Systems, Credit Suisse, Deutsche B√∂rse, Goldman Sachs, HCL Technologies Ltd, Progress Software, IIT Software, INETCO Systems Limited, Informatica (including 29 West), JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft Corporation, my-Channels, Novell, Red Hat, Software AG, Solace Systems, StormMQ, Tervela Inc., TWIST Process Innovations ltd, VMware (which acquired Rabbit Technologies) and WSO2. In August 2011, the AMQP working group announced its reorganization into an OASIS member section. AMQP 1.0 was released by the AMQP working group on 30 October 2011, at a conference in New York. At the event Microsoft, Red Hat, VMware, Apache, INETCO and IIT Software demonstrated software running the protocol in an interoperability demonstration. The next day, on 1 November 2011, the formation of an OASIS Technical Committee was announcedOASIS Forms AMQP Technical Committee to Advance Business Messaging Interoperability Within Middleware, Mobile, and Cloud Environments to advance this contributed AMQP version 1.0 through the international open standards process. The first draft from OASIS was released in February 2012, the changes as compared to that published by the Working Group being restricted to edits for improved clarity (no functional changes). The second draft was released for public review on 20 June (again with no functional changes), and AMQP was approved as an OASIS standard on 31 October 2012. OASIS AMQP was approved for release as an ISO and IEC International Standard in April 2014. AMQP 1.0 was balloted through the Joint Technical Committee on Information Technology (JTC1) of the International Standards Organization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The approved OASIS AMQP submission has been given the designation, ISO/IEC 19464. Previous versions of AMQP were 0-8, published in June 2006, 0-9, published in December 2006, 0-10 published in February 2008 and 0-9-1, published in November 2008. These earlier releases are significantly different from the 1.0 specification. Whilst AMQP originated in the financial services industry, it has general applicability to a broad range of middleware problems.  Description of AMQP 1.0  = Type system = AMQP defines a self-describing encoding scheme allowing interoperable representation of a wide range of commonly used types. It also allows typed data to be annotated with additional meaning, for example a particular string value might be annotated so that it could be understood as a URL. Likewise a map value containing key-value pairs for 'name', 'address' etc., might be annotated as being a representation of a 'customer' type. The type-system is used to define a message format allowing standard and extended meta-data to be expressed and understood by processing entities. It is also used to define the communication primitives through which messages are exchanged between such entities, i.e. the AMQP frame bodies. = Performatives and the link protocol = The basic unit of data in AMQP is a frame. There are nine AMQP frame bodies defined that are used to initiate, control and tear down the transfer of messages between two peers. These are: * open (the connection) * begin (the session) * attach (the link) * transfer * flow * disposition * detach (the link) * end (the session) * close (the connection) The link protocol is at the heart of AMQP. An attach frame body is sent to initiate a new link; a detach to tear down a link. Links may be established in order to receive or send messages. Messages are sent over an established link using the transfer frame. Messages on a link flow in only one direction. Transfers are subject to a credit based flow control scheme, managed using flow frames. This allows a process to protect itself from being overwhelmed by too large a volume of messages or more simply to allow a subscribing link to pull messages as and when desired. Each transferred message must eventually be settled. Settlement ensures that the sender and receiver agree on the state of the transfer, providing reliability guarantees. Changes in state and settlement for a transfer (or set of transfers) are communicated between the peers using the disposition frame. Various reliability guarantees can be enforced this way: at-most-once, at-least-once and exactly-once. Multiple links, in both directions, can be grouped together in a session. A session is a bidirectional, sequential conversation between two peers that is initiated with a begin frame and terminated with an end frame. A connection between two peers can have multiple sessions multiplexed over it, each logically independent. Connections are initiated with an open frame in which the sending peer's capabilities are expressed, and terminated with a close frame. = Message format = AMQP defines as the bare message, that part of the message that is created by the sending application. This is considered immutable as the message is transferred between one or more processes. Ensuring the message as sent by the application is immutable allows for end-to-end message signing and/or encryption and ensures that any integrity checks (e.g. hashes or digests) remain valid. The message can be annotated by intermediaries during transit, but any such annotations are kept distinct from the immutable bare message. Annotations may be added before or after the bare message. The header is a standard set of delivery-related annotations that can be requested or indicated for a message and includes time to live, durability, priority. The bare message itself is structured as an optional list of standard properties (message id, user id, creation time, reply to, subject, correlation id, group id etc.), an optional list of application-specific properties (i.e., extended properties) and a body, which AMQP refers to as application data. Properties are specified in the AMQP type system, as are annotations. The application data can be of any form, and in any encoding the application chooses. One option is to use the AMQP type system to send structured, self-describing data. = Messaging capabilities = The link protocol transfers messages between two nodes but assumes very little as to what those nodes are or how they are implemented. A key category is those nodes used as a rendezvous point between senders and receivers of messages (e.g. queues or topics). The AMQP specification calls such nodes distribution nodes and codifies some common behaviors. This includes: * some standard outcomes for transfers, through which receivers of messages can for example accept or reject messages * a mechanism for indicating or requesting one of the two basic distribution patterns, competing- and non-competing- consumers, through the distribution modes move and copy respectively * the ability to create nodes on-demand, e.g. for temporary response queues * the ability to refine the set of message of interest to a receiver through filters Though AMQP can be used in simple peer-to-peer systems, defining this framework for messaging capabilities additionally enables interoperability with messaging intermediaries (brokers, bridges etc.) in larger, richer messaging networks. The framework specified covers basic behaviors but allows for extensions to evolve that can be further codified and standardised.

It focuses on core features which are necessary for interoperability at Internet scale. It contains less explicit routing than previous versions because core functionality is the first to be rigorously standardized. AMQP 1.0 interoperability has been more extensively tested with more implementors than prior versions. The AMQP website contains the OASIS specification for version 1.0. Earlier versions of AMQP, published prior to the release of 1.0 (see History above) and significantly different from it, include: * AMQP 0-9-1, which has clients available \\"for many popular programming languages and platforms\\" * AMQP 0-10  Comparable specifications  These are the known open protocol specifications that cover the same or similar space as AMQP: * Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP), a text-based protocol developed at Codehaus; uses the JMS-like semantics of 'destination'. * Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol. * MQTT, a lightweight publish-subscribe protocol. * OpenWire as used by ActiveMQ. Java Message Service (JMS), is often compared to AMQP. However, JMS is an API specification (part of the Java EE specification) that defines how message producers and consumers are implemented. JMS does not guarantee interoperability between implementations, and the JMS-compliant messaging system in use may need to be deployed on both client and server. On the other hand, AMQP is a wire-level protocol specification. In theory AMQP provides interoperability as different AMQP-compliant software can be deployed on the client and server sides. Note that, like HTTP and XMPP, AMQP does not have a standard API.

They are typified by their splayed pectoral fins, exaggerated lateral spines, flattened bodies, and numerous tubercles that decorated all of the plates and scales of their armor. They reached a peak in diversity during the Early Devonian and were found throughout the world, particularly in Europe (especially in Germany), North America, Asia, South America, and Australia. The petalichthids Lunaspis and Wijdeaspis are among the best known. The earliest and most primitive known petalichthyid is Diandongpetalichthys, which is from earliest Devonian-aged strata of Yunnan. The presence of Diandongpetalichthys, along with other primitive petalichthyids including Neopetalichthys and Quasipetalichthys, and more advanced petalichthyids, suggest that the order may have arisen in China, possibly during the late Silurian. Because they had compressed body forms, it is speculated they were bottom-dwellers that chased after or ambushed smaller fish. Their diet is not clear, as none of the fossil specimens found have preserved mouth parts. Taxonomy According to Zhu's 1991 redescription of Diandongpetalichthys,Zhu, M. \\"New information on Diandongpetalichthys (Placodermi: Petalichthyida).\\" Early vertebrates and related problems of evolutionary biology. Science Press, Beijing (1991): 179-192. that genus represents the most basal petalichthyid known, as it has a comparatively elongated head, and shares certain anatomical features with acanthothoracids and primitive arthrodires such as the actinolepids. Quasipetalichthys, in turn, strongly resembles Diandongpetalichthys (aside from having a much more square-looking skull). In Zhu's redescription, \\"Quasipetalichthyidae\\" (comprising Quasipetalichthys, Eurycaraspis, and possibly Neopetalichthys) and \\"Macropetalichthyidae\\" (comprising all the other \\"advanced\\" petalichthyid genera not including Neopetalichthys, or Diandongpetalichthys) form a dichotomy, with Diandongpetalichthys as a sister taxon. Neopetalichthys is treated as an incertae sedis within Petalichthyida that may or may not be placed within or near Quasipetalichthyidae.

New Kingdom, Dynasty XVIII, reign of Amenhotep III, c. 1390-1352 BC. Possibly from Saqqara. lotus and grapes Egyptian faience (natively called tjehenet; modern archeological terms include sintered quartz, glazed frit, and glazed composition) is not, technically, faience. It is a sintered-quartz ceramic, with a surface vitrification which creates a bright lustre of various colours (blue-green being the most common). It has been defined as a \\"material made from powdered quartz covered with a true vitreous coating, usually in a transparent blue or green isotropic glass\\". Tjehenet is distinct from the crystalline pigment Egyptian blue.David Frederick Grose, The Toledo Museum of Art, Early Ancient Glass: Core-Formed, Rod-Formed, and Cast Vessels and Objects from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Roman Empire, 1600 BC to AD 50 (Manchester: Hudson Hills Press, 1999), 29. Egyptian faience is considerably more porous than glass proper. It can be cast in molds to create vessels, jewelry and decorative objects.Grose, The Toledo Museum of Art, Early Ancient Glass, 29. Although it contains the major constituents of glass (silica, lime) and no clay until late periods, Egyptian faience is frequently discussed in surveys of ancient pottery, as in stylistic and art-historical terms, objects made of it are closer to pottery styles than ancient Egyptian glass. Faience Vessel with Procession of Four Bulls, ca. 775-653 B.C.E. Brooklyn Museum Egyptian faience was very widely used for small objects, from beads to small statues, and is found in both elite and popular contexts. It was the most common material for scarabs and other forms of amulet and ushabti figures, and it was used in most forms of ancient Egyptian jewellery, as the glaze made it smooth against the skin. Larger applications included cups and bowls, and wall tiles, mostly used for temples.Peck, William H., \\"The Material World of Ancient Egypt\\", 2013, Cambridge University Press, , 9781107276383, google books The well-known blue figures of a hippopotamus, placed in the tombs of officials, can be up to 20 cm long,Louvre: Hippopotamus figurine, Department of Egyptian Antiquities: From the late prehistoric period to the late Middle Kingdom (circa 3800 - 1710 BC) approaching the maximum practical size for Egyptian faience, though the Victoria and Albert Museum in London has a sceptre, dated 1427‚Äì1400 BC. Scope of the term Late Period It is called \\"Egyptian faience\\" to distinguish it from faience, the tin-glazed pottery associated with Faenza in northern Italy.Nicholson and Peltenburg 2000. Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology. In: Nicholson, P.T. and Shaw, I.Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 177-194.137‚Äì142. Egyptian faience was both exported widely in the ancient world and made locally in many places, and is found in Mesopotamia, around the Mediterranean and in northern Europe as far away as Scotland. The term is used for the material wherever it was made and modern scientific analyses are often the only way of establishing the provenance of simple objects such as the very common beads.Stone and Thomas 1956. The Use and Distribution of Faience in the Ancient East and Prehistoric Europe, Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society, London 22, 37‚Äì84.‚Äì142. The term is therefore unsatisfactory in several respects, although clear in an Ancient Egyptian context, and is increasingly rejected in museum and archaeological usage. The British Museum now calls this material \\"glazed composition\\", with the following note in the \\"information\\" box on their online collection database: > The term is used for objects with a body made of finely powdered quartz > grains fused together with small amounts of alkali and/or lime through > partial heating. The bodies are usually colourless but natural impurities > give them a brown or greyish tint. Colourants can also be added to give it > an artificial colour. It can be modelled by hand, thrown or moulded, and > hardens with firing. This material is used in the context of Islamic > ceramics where it is described as stonepaste (or fritware). Glazed > composition is related to glass, but glass is formed by completely fusing > the ingredients in a liquid melted at high temperature. This material is > also popularly called faience in the contexts of Ancient Egypt and Ancient > Near East. However, this is a misnomer as these objects have no relationship > to the glazed pottery vessels made in Faenza, from which the faience term > derives. Other authors use the terms sintered quartz, glazed frit, frit, > composition, Egyptian Blue, paste or (in the 19th century) even porcelain, > although the last two terms are very inappropriate as they also describe > imitation gems and a type of ceramic. Frit is technically a flux. Glazes Kneeling Statue of Nesbanebdjedet, ca. 755-730 BC, now 13.8 cm high From the inception of faience in the archaeological record of Ancient Egypt, the elected colors of the glazes varied within an array of blue-green hues. Glazed in these colours, faience was perceived as substitute for blue-green materials such as turquoise, found in the Sinai Peninsula, and lapis lazuli from Afghanistan. According to the archaeologist David Frederick Grose, the quest to imitate precious stones \\"explains why most all early glasses are opaque and brilliantly colored\\" and that the deepest blue color imitating lapis lazuli was likely the most sought-after.David Frederick Grose, The Toledo Museum of Art, Early Ancient Glass, 45. As early as the Predynastic graves at Naqada, Badar, el-Amrah, Matmar, Harageh, Avadiyedh and El-Gerzeh, glazed steatite and faience beads are found associated with these semi- precious stones.Nicholson 1998. Nicholson, P.T.1993. Egyptian faience and glass. Aylesbury: Shire- Egyptology.137‚Äì142. The association of faience with turquoise and lapis lazuli becomes even more conspicuous in Quennou's funerary papyrus, giving his title as the director of overseer of faience-making, using the word which strictly means lapis lazuli, which by the New Kingdom had also come to refer to the 'substitute', faience. The symbolism embedded in blue glazing could recall both the Nile, the waters of heaven and the home of the gods, whereas green could possibly evoke images of regeneration, rebirth and vegetation.Friedman, F.D. (ed.). 1998. Gifts of the Nile-ancient Egyptian faience. London: Thames and Hudson. 177-194.137‚Äì142. Egyptian faience beaded fishnet dress dating from the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt. =Relationship with Egyptian copper industry= The discovery of faience glazing has tentatively been associated with the copper industry: bronze scale and corrosion products of leaded copper objects are found in the manufacture of faience pigments.Kaczamrcyz, A. and Hedges. R.E.M. 1983. Ancient Egyptian Faience. Warminster: Aris and Phillips.137‚Äì142. However, although the likelihood of glazed quartz pebbles developing accidentally in traces in copper smelting furnaces from the copper and wood ash is high, the regions in which these processes originate do not coincide.Petrie, W. M. F.1909. Memphis I, London: British School of Archeology in Egypt.137‚Äì142. =Relationship with Egyptian glass industry= Although it appears that no glass was intentionally produced in Egypt before the Eighteenth Dynasty (as the establishment of glass manufacture is generally attributed to the reign of Thutmose III), it is likely that faience, frit and glass were all made in close proximity or in the same workshop complex, since developments in one industry are reflected in others. Such close relationship is reflected in the prominent similarity of the formulations of faience glaze and contemporary glass compositions. Despite the differences in the pyrotechnology of glass and faience, faience being worked cold, archaeological evidence suggests that New Kingdom glass and faience production was undertaken in the same workshops. Production Assortment of Egyptian faience beads =Typical composition and access to raw materials= Faience has been defined as the first high technology ceramic, to emphasize its status as an artificial medium, rendering it effectively a precious stone.Vandiver, P.B.F.1983. Egyptian faience technology, Appendix A. In: A. Kaczmarczyk and R.E.M. Hedges, Editors, Ancient Egyptian Faience, Warminster: Aris and Phillips, A1‚ÄìA14 Egyptian faience is a non-clay based ceramic composed of crushed quartz or sand, with small amounts of calcite lime and a mixture of alkalis, displaying surface vitrification due to the soda lime silica glaze often containing copper pigments to create a bright blue- green luster. While in most instances domestic ores seem to have provided the bulk of the mineral pigments, evidence suggests that during periods of prosperity, raw materials not available locally, such as lead and copper, were imported. Plant ash, from \\"halophyte\\" (salt-tolerant) plants typical of dry and sea areas, was the major source of alkali until the Ptolemaic Period, when natron-based alkalis almost completely replaced the previous source. Although the chemical composition of faience materials varies over time and according to the status of the workshop, also as a cause of change of accessibility of raw materials, the material constitution of the glaze is at all times consistent with the generally accepted version of faience glazing. =Faience working technology= Typical faience mixture is thixotropic, that is thick at first and then soft and flowing as it begins to be formed.Kiefer, C. and Allibert, A. 2007. Pharanoic Blue Ceramics: the Process of Self-glazing. Archeology 24, 107‚Äì117 This property, together with the angularity of silica particles, accounts for the gritty slumps formed when the material is wetted, rendering faience a difficult material to hold a shape.Noble, J. V. 1969. The technique of Egyptian faience. American Journal of Archaeology 73, 435‚Äì439 If pressed too vigorously, this material will resist flow until it yields and cracks, due to its limited plastic deformation and low yield strength. This faience vessel from the reign of Amenhotep III exhibits two different shades of blue that can be achieved by adding cobalt and copper pigments to faience paste.Walters Art Museum, Baltimore. =Body binding technology= A number of possible binding agents, amongst Arabic gum, clay, lime, egg white and resin, have been suggested to help in the binding process. Although traces of clay have been found in most Pharaonic faience, reconstruction experiments showed that clay, organic gums or lime while successfully improving the wet working performance, failed to improve the fired strength of the faience, or proved the gum was too sticky for the removal of objects from their molds.Lucas, A. and Harris, J. R., 1962, Ancient Egyptian materials and industries. London: Edward Arnold. 435‚Äì439 The use of alkalis as binders, in the form of natron or plant ash, produced suitable results in experiments. Pulverized glass or sintered material of similar composition could also enhance the fired strength of faience bodies: the compositions of such glasses is in fact comparable to the published compositions of New Kingdom glass.K√ºhne, K. 1974 \\"Fr√ºhgeschichtliche Werkstoffe auf Silikatischer Basis\\", Das Altertum 20, 67‚Äì80 =Body working technology= Three methods have been hypothesized to shape the body of faience objects: modeling, moulding and abrasion, the last being used in conjunction with the first two. Modeling, scraping and grinding are the techniques most widely used in earlier times, as represented in the material qualities of Predynastic and Protodynastic faience objects. Predynastic bead manufacture is essentially a cold technology, more akin to stone working than glass: a general form of faience is modeled, possibly free formed by hand, then holes are drilled to create beads. In the Middle Kingdom, the techniques employed are molding and forming on a core, sometimes in conjunction with intermediate layers between the glaze and the body. Marbleized faience, resulting from the working of different colored faience bodies together, so as to produce a uniform adherent body, also appears in this period. Towards the end of the Middle Kingdom, incising, inlaying and resisting techniques appear: these were bound to become progressively popular towards the New Kingdom. In the New Kingdom, beads, amulets and finger rings are produced by a combination of modeling and molding techniques. In this period, sculptural detail is created using inlays of different colored faience or by scraping the body to reveal the white intermediate layer in relief. Moulding was first applied to faience manufacture in the Middle Kingdom by forming a model of an object, or employing a finished faience piece, impressing it in wet clay, and later by firing the clay to create a durable mold.Notes on the manufacture and use of faience rings at Amarna. In: Kemp, B.J. Amarna Reports V. London: Egypt Exploration Society. 160-168, 160‚Äì168 The faience paste could then be pressed into the mold, and following drying, be re-worked through surface abrasion before firing. Moulds could facilitate mass production of faience objects such as amulets rings and inlays, as evidenced by the several thousand of small open face, earth-ware clay molds excavated at Tell el Amarna. Falcon, Ptolemaic period, 13.5 cm high, see text Wheel throwing, possibly occurring from the New Kingdom onwards, is certainly established by the Greco-Roman period, when large amounts of clay seem to have been added to the faience body. Because of the limited plasticity of faience, rendering throwing extremely difficult, a progressive increase of clay in the faience bodies culminating in the quartz, clay and glass frit bodies of Islamic times, is observed in the archaeological record.Kiefer, C. 1968 Les c√©ramiques blues, pharanoiques et leur proc√©d√© r√©volutionnaire d'emaillage. Industrie C√©ramique. May, 395‚Äì402 Ptolemaic and Roman faience tends to be typologically and technologically distinct from the earlier material: it is characterized by the widespread use of moulding and high relief on vessels.Shortland, A.J. and Tite M.S. 2005. A technological study of Ptolemaic ‚Äì early roman faience from Memphis, Egypt Archaeometry 47/1, 31‚Äì46 31‚Äì46 A very unusual and finely made group of figures of deities and falcons in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, apparently representing hieroglyphs that are elements from a royal inscription, perhaps from a wooden shrine, is decorated in a form of champlev√© (typically a technique for enamel on metal). Depressions in the faience body were filled with coloured \\"vitreous pastes\\" and refired, followed by polishing.Egypt and the Ancient Near East, 1987, p. 82, Metropolitan Museum of Art, , 9780870994135, google books Polychrome pieces were usually made by inlaying different colours of paste. Glazing technology The technology of glazing a siliceous body with a soda lime silica glaze employs various methods discovered over time: namely application, efflorescence and cementation glazing. Vases probably used for the funeral of Rameses II =Application glazing= In the application method, formerly assumed to be the only one used for faience glazing; silica, lime and alkalis are ground in the raw state to a small particle size, thus mixed in water to form a slurry which is then applied to the quartz core. Partial fritting of the slurry favors the first stages of vitrification, which in turn lowers the final firing temperature. The slurry can be then applied to the body, through brushing or dipping, to create a fine, powdery coating. Upon firing, the water from the melting glaze partially diffuses in the sand body, sintering the quartz particles and thus creating some solid bridges in the body. =Efflorescence glazing= In the self-glazing process of efflorescence, the glazing materials, in the form of water-soluble alkali salts, are mixed with the raw crushed quartz of the core of the object.Binns. 1932. An experiment in Egyptian blue glaze. Journal of the American Ceramic Society 31‚Äì46 As the water in the body evaporates, the salts migrate to the surface of the object to recrystallize, creating a thin surface, which glazes upon firing. =Cementation glazing= lotus decoration, 14.4 cm high Cementation glazing, a technique discovered in the Middle Kingdom, is also a self-glazing technique. The possibility of the existence of cementation glazing, also known as 'Qom technique', followed the observation of this method in use at the village of 'Qom' in Iran in the 1960s. In this method the artifact, while buried in a glazing powder with a high flux content, is heated inside a vessel, causing the fusion of the object with the cement. During firing, the flux migrates to the quartz and combines with it to form a glassy coating. =Alternative techniques= A vapour glaze reaction similar to salt glazing, as an alternative glazing process, has been suggested. In this process, the vaporization or dissociation of salts leads to vapour transport through the enveloping powder to the quartz body where a glaze is formed.Williamson, R.S.1942. The Saqqara Graph. Nature 150, 607‚Äì607 =Recognition of glazing techniques= Although glaze compositions vary regionally and chronologically, depending on the formation of the body and the glazing process employed, objects produced with different glazing techniques do not exhibit immediate diagnostic chemical variations in their compositions.Tite, M.S., Freestone I.C. and Bimson. M. 1983. Egyptian faience: an investigation of the methods of production, Archaeometry 25, 17‚Äì27 The recognition of the various glazing techniques, through microscopic observations of the degree of sintering and the vitreous phase of quartz body, is also ambiguous. For instance, objects with applied glazes and those which may have been glazed by efflorescence have overlapping characteristic features.Tite, M.S. and Bimson, M. 1986. Faience: an investigation of the microstructures associated with the different methods of glazing, Archaeometry 28, 69‚Äì78 The following proposed criteria are subject to variation caused by increases in flux concentration, firing temperatures and time at peak temperatures. Recognition of application glazing- Macroscopically, applied glazes vary in thickness through the body, displaying thicker glazes on bases. The traces of kiln supports, as well as the characteristic tendency to run and drip leading to pooling, may indicate the orientation of the object during firing. In high magnification observations, the interface boundary of body and glaze appears well defined. The absence of interstitial glass in the core is characteristic of application glazing: however, the possibility of adding glazing mixture to the quartz sand body, as well as the use of pre-melted glazes in the later periods, can predictably increase the degree of sintering of the core Recognition of cementation- Objects glazed through cementation display a thin even glaze all over the body, with no drying or firing marks, and portray a fairly friable and soft body Microscopically, the concentration of copper characteristically decreases from the surface: the interaction layer is thin and well defined and the interstitial glass is absent with exception to the vicinity of the boundary layer. Recognition of efflorescence glazing- Pieces glazed by efflorescence may show traces of stand marks: the glaze appears thick and prone to cracking, thinning toward the edge of the piece and in concave areas. In high magnification the interstitial glass is extensive; the unreacted salts which have not reached the surface fuse of the body accumulate in the core, creating bridges between the quartz particles. Typologies Hippopotamus figure for a tomb, Middle Kingdom An extensive literature has accumulated in attempt to explain the processing of Egyptian faience and develop an adequate typology that encompasses both technological choices and chemical variations of faience bodies.Brill, R.H. 1999. Chemical Analyses of Early Glasses: Volume 1 (tables) and Volume 2 (catalogue), Corning, NY: Corning Museum of Glass., 69‚Äì78 Body color, density and luster provided the basis of the first typology developed for faience: seven variants were proposed by Lucas and Harris and still permit the archaeologist to distinguish faience objects during field sorting. =Classification of body variants= Most of the seven variants introduced by Lucas fail to recognize the glazing technology utilized or to suggest the stylistic and technological choices embedded in the manufacture of a faience object. However, variant A describes a technologically unique product and as such is still applicable: it has a finely ground underglaze consisting of quartz particles in a glass matrix, often revealed by incisions or depressions cut into the overlying glaze. Glassy faience, variant E, displays no distinct outer layer from the interior, thus it has been suggested that the term 'faience' is a misnomer and the alternative name 'imperfect glass' has been advised. Regarding variant F specimens, Lucas suggests the use of lead glazes, however it appears that lead glazing was never practiced in Ancient Egypt. Workshop evidence Ramesses III prisoner tiles: Inlay figures, faience and glass, of \\"the traditional enemies of Ancient Egypt\\" from a royal palace of Ramesses III (1182-1151 B.C.), at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. From left: 2 Nubians, Philistine, Amorite, Syrian, Hittite The excavations led by Petrie at Tell-Amarna and Naucratis have reported finding workshop evidence. Nicholson explains, however, that while a square furnace-like structure at Amarna may be related to faience production, Petrie did not encounter any actual faience kilns at the site.Nicholson, Egyptian Faience and Glass, 30. Lucas documented a large number of molds at the palace area of Amenhotep III at Qantir, from 19th to 20th Dynasties, and at the palace area of Naucratis, also described in different sources as a scarab maker's and faience factory. However, seeing there is a lack of carefully documented archaeological evidence as to the nature of faience factory sites, direct information about the glazing process does not exist. Although recent excavations at the archaeological sites of Abydos and Amarna have supplemented our knowledge of the ancient production of faience gained from the earlier excavated sites of Lisht, Memphis and Naukratis, the differentiation of glass furnaces from faience kilns still remains problematic. Replication experiments, using modern kilns and replica faience pastes, indicate that faience is fired in the range of 800‚Äì1000¬∞Verges, F.B. 1992. Bleus Egyptiennes.

In the US, the game was published by Nikom. The PC Engine version is an adaptation of the arcade original and published as Atomic Robo-Kid Special. Plot In the 21st century, a blast of cosmic radiation bombarded Terra-12, a deep-space outpost of Earth, hideously mutating all transplanted life. A fleet of savage beings followed the radiation wave and invaded the planet and began the systematic destruction of all remaining sentient life. Years of battling the alien 'governors' have gone by, and now only one hope survives to avenge the desperate terran colonists. Gameplay Screenshot The player controls the titular character through six stages of increasing difficulty, facing an alien \\"governor\\" boss (which are so large as to be considered levels in and of themselves, as some of the bosses take up several screens) at the end of each level, followed by a \\"duel\\" level against other Robo-Kid sized robots. Many levels branch into others, giving the player the choice over which zone to enter next, increasing replayability. Robo-Kid can collect four different weapons (whichever weapon is selected is lost when Robo-kid loses a life) in addition to his default gun, collect powerups for a shield that activates on enemy contact, plus rapid fire and speed powerups. The player can also encounter a friendly dinosaur-looking robot that sells weapons and shields to Robo-kid using extra lives as currency. Ports The game was ported to the PC Engine, Sega Genesis, Commodore 64, Atari ST, Amiga, and X68000. A demo was distributed of the ZX Spectrum version before it was cancelled.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Atomic Robo-Kid on their March 1, 1989 issue as being the eighth most-successful table arcade unit of the year. Legacy The game was released on the Nintendo Switch in the Nintendo eShop on 15 November 2018 by Hamster Corporation as part of their Arcade Archives series.

The Quarry Explorer Tour reaches the highest point of the Llechwedd Quarry site. Llechwedd () is a visitor attraction near Blaenau Ffestiniog, Gwynedd, Wales. It details the history of slate quarrying in the town and specifically the Llechwedd quarry in which it is located. The main aspect of Llechwedd is its Llechwedd Deep Mine Tour which has the steepest narrow gauge railway in the UK and travels over 500 feet underground to the disused slate caverns, and the Quarry Explorer Tour which heads out to the furthest reaches of the Llechwedd site to explore the history of mining in the area. The attraction also incorporates Mountain biking tracks, Zip-lines and giant underground trampolines. Bounce Below is right beside the underground zip wire, Zip World Caverns and Zip World Titan -longest zip course in Europ.  History  The narrow gauge Miners' Tramway, opened in 1972 under the name \\"Quarry Tours\\", was a railway travelling 800 metres underground. The trains were hauled by battery-electric locomotives and travelled through tunnels and into a series of quarry chambers. The tramway's closure in 2014, as part of a revamp of the caverns, caused some controversy. The Deep Mine, opened in 1979, is accessed by the narrow gaugeTourist and Enthusiast Railways - Wales Deep Mine Railway, a steep passenger funicular with a gradient of 1:1.8 or 30¬∞. At the foot of the funicular, visitors can walk through several tunnels and chambers. The Deep Mine Railway is the steepest passenger railway in the UK. In 1992 the Deep Mine displays were upgraded using audio-visual technology supplied by Eurodisney In 2014 the Bounce Below attraction, described as \\"the world's largest underground trampoline\\", opened in the mine caverns along with the Zip World wire course outside. As part of the 2014 developments a new guided Victorian Mine Tour opened combining the funicular, the tunnels from the two previous tours and some tunnels newly opened to the public. In 2015 the Zip World Caverns wire course opened within the caves. In January 2019 a television crew took over the caverns for a week to film the world's first ever underground games show, Y Siambr, broadcast later in the year on S4C.  Awards  It was claimed by Ivor Wynne Jones, a director of Llechwedd Slate Caverns,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_west/6517861.stm to be \\"winner of every major tourism award\\". In 1976, the opening year, Llechwedd won the British Tourist Authority's \\"Come to Britain\\" award, their top award. In 1980, the caverns were awarded the \\"Silver Otter\\" award from the British Guild of Travel Writers. That year, they also won their third award from the British Tourist Authority - the first British tourist attraction to win three of these awards.

The largest species in the genus reaches up to in standard length. Taxonomy The taxonomy of this genus has been a matter of dispute, all having been placed in Hypostomus in the past, and some occasionally placed in Squaliforma.

Biography Neeman was born to a religious Zionist family in Tel Aviv during the Mandate era. He was educated at the Midrashiat Noam high-school yeshiva and completed his military service in the Golani Brigade. He went on to study law at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, earning a LL.B in 1964. In 1965, he earned a LL.M from New York University, and in 1968, a LL.D. After returning to Israel, in 1972 he founded the law firm Herzog, Fox & Ne'eman, along with future president of Israel Chaim Herzog. Neeman was appointed Director General of the Finance Ministry in 1979, serving until 1981. In June 1996 he was appointed to the Israeli cabinet as Minister of Justice by Prime Minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, despite not being a member of the Knesset. Two months later he resigned from the cabinet, after Attorney General Michael Ben-Yair opened a criminal investigation into allegations that Neeman had tried to suborn a witness in the trial of MK Aryeh Deri. Neeman was eventually cleared of the charges and returned to the cabinet in July 1997 as Minister of Finance until the end of the Netanyahu premiership at the 1999 elections. In late March 2009, following Netanyahu's return to power as Prime Minister of Israel, Neeman was again appointed as Justice Minister. Neeman resided in Jerusalem in the Talbiya section. He is survived by his wife and six children. Committee Membership Neeman has chaired or been a member of numerous national and international committees, including the Executive Committee of Bar-Ilan University, the public committee appointed by the Speaker of the Knesset to determine salaries and other payments to government officials, the public committee appointed by the cabinet for the Drafting of the Constitution, the Public Committee on Educational Centers, the Public Committee on Privatisation Issues of El Al, the board of governors of Bank of Israel, the Committee for the Conversion Law, the National Committee for the Identification of Fallen Soldiers in Times of Emergency, Israel Atomic Energy Committee and the Central Committee of the World Bank. Political views On 8 December 2009, while serving as the Minister of Justice, Ne'eman was reported as saying that he believed that Halakha should gradually be made binding law in Israel, with the ultimate goal of making Israel a Halakhic state. But he later denied this, emphasizing that \\"the Knesset is the legislator in Israel, and the interpretation of its laws is determined by the [civil] courts.\\" He said that he advocated the use of religious courts only in an auxiliary role, to \\"resolve financial disputes in accordance with the principles of Jewish law. The court system in Israel is backed up, and therefore, cases should be transferred to an alternative system.\\" References External links * *Herzog, Fox & Neeman *Speech that Yaakov Neeman gave at \\"Be A Mensch\\" book launch Category:1939 births Category:2017 deaths Category:People from Tel Aviv Category:Jews in Mandatory Palestine Category:Hebrew University of Jerusalem alumni Category:New York University School of Law alumni Category:Israeli jurists Category:Israeli chief executives Category:Israeli people of Hungarian-Jewish descent Category:Ministers of Finance of Israel Category:Ministers of Justice of Israel Category:20th-century Israeli politicians Category:21st-century Israeli politicians Category:Israeli Orthodox Jews ","title":"Yaakov Neeman"},{"id":"5657770","text":"Risso may refer to: People * Antoine Risso (1777‚Äì1845), French naturalist, eponym of Risso's dolphin * Eduardo Risso (born 1961), Argentine comic book artist * Eduardo Risso (born 1925), Uruguayan rower Places *Risso, Uruguay ","title":"Risso"},{"id":"5657792","text":"Nader Mohammed Kara () (born 19 January 1980) is a Libyan football attacker who, as of 2006/2007 season is playing for Al Ahly Tripoli.

Today, the buildings are used to house administration offices for Swansea University. They can be found at the eastern end of the Swansea University Singleton Park campus. The nucleus of the house is a neo-classical villa, octagonal in plan, erected in 1784 under the name of Marino by Edward King, a customs official. In 1817 this was bought by the industrialist John Henry Vivian, who added rectangular one-bay extensions to either side. In 1823 Vivian commissioned the architect P. F. Robinson to re-model the house in the neo-gothic style. Work started in 1827, and a decade later Robinson published Domestic Architecture in the Tudor Style, a monograph in all but name on Singleton Abbey. The house then served as residence of the Vivian family for several years. The house survives, with limited losses, much as it appears in the engraved plates of the book. The back stairs, on the axis of the south front, and the ground-floor room in the centre of the south front, with a bowed inner end, survive from the original house of 1784. In 1919 the 2nd Lord Swansea sold Singleton Abbey to Swansea Corporation. In 1920 the Corporation rented and in 1923 sold the house and the nucleus of the estate to the University College of Swansea, which made the Abbey its headquarters.Newman (2004) References External links *Gathering the Jewels: Singleton Abbey, Swansea *Swansea University: Singleton Abbey Reading * Category:Houses completed in 1784 Category:Swansea University Category:Grade II listed buildings in Swansea Category:Houses in Swansea Category:Country houses in Wales ","title":"Singleton Abbey"},{"id":"5657801","text":"Entrance to Wei√üensee Cemetery.

The player pilots a tank mecha and shoots enemies (it can fire in 8 directions), collects power-ups to increase shields, operates the remote attack drone, and defeats bosses to advance levels. It features tunnel levels with a first-person view. Gameplay Gameplay is divided into two types. Some stages let the player take control of the tank from a top-down 3rd-person view. The tank can shoot in 8 directions. Holding down the fire button enables auto-fire, but the tank is not able to move during that time. The tank is destroyed with one hit, but a certain amount of energy can be used to create a shield, which can take one hit. Up to three shields can be stacked. Energy is obtained by collecting power orbs which are left by shot down enemies. Enemies can also leave a green \\"D\\"-power up, which summons a robotic orb which will accompany the tank until the next life loss. As long as energy is available, the orb can be ordered to attack a target in range. The other stages are played from a first-person view. The player must fend off several waves of enemies and navigate through destructible mines. In this mode, the tank can also move while auto-firing. Power orbs can again be obtained, but the robotic orb is not present in this mode. The button to make the orb attack is instead used to turn the tank around.

He is best known for writing the Weil√ºe and Dianl√ºe, which according to the Book of Sui, are composed of 33 and 89 volumes respectively. The Old Book of Tang listed 38 volumes of the Weil√ºe and 50 volumes of the Dianl√ºe, while the New Book of Tang 58 listed the Weil√ºe as containing 50 volumes. Neither of these works are extant, however a volume of the Weil√ºe was quoted as an extensive footnote to the Records of the Three Kingdoms in the (30th) section on the Wuhuan, Xianbei and Dongyi by Pei Songzhi during the fifth century. It served as an additional guide to the Western Regions on the book. The volume has only survived because it was included as an extensive note to Records of the Three Kingdoms. According to the Shitong, Yu Huan was at one time the mayor of Luoyang, the capital of the Cao Wei state (220-265). Although it seems he never left China, he collected a large amount of information on the countries to the west of China including Parthia, India, the Roman Empire and the various routes to them. Some of this information had reached China well before Yu Huan's time, and can also be found in the sections dealing with the Western Regions of the Records of the Grand Historian, the Book of Han, and/or the Book of the Later Han. In spite of the inclusion of earlier (and sometimes fanciful) information, the Weil√ºe contains much new, unique and generally trustworthy material. Most of it dates from the late second and early third centuries. It is this new information that makes the Weil√ºe such a valuable source. Much of it appears to date from the Eastern Han dynasty, before China was largely cut off from the West by civil wars and unrest along its borders during the late 2nd century CE.

Thaddeus L. (Ted) Knap, is perhaps best known for having been included on Nixon's enemies list despite his belief that \\"I thought Nixon, except for Watergate (a huge caveat), was a good president.‚Äù Rep. Richard M. Nixon (R. Calif.) reviews details of his \\"pumpkin papers\\" speech in 1950 with reporter Ted Knap after the Lincoln Day dinner in Waukesha, WI.Knap was chief political writer and White House correspondent for Scripps Howard News Service. He covered five presidents, five presidential campaigns, and fourteen national political conventions (not counting the 1936 Democratic convention in Chicago that he covered for his high school newspaper). He went to Vietnam with Johnson, to Moscow with Nixon, to China with Ford, around the world with Carter, to Europe and the Vatican with Reagan and on July 24, 1969 witnessed, from the deck of the USS Hornet, the Pacific splashdown of the first astronauts to step on the moon. Also, Knap had breakfast with Princess Grace in Monaco, lunch with Shirley Temple Black in Washington, drinks with Shirley MacLaine in New Hampshire while covering the 1968 presidential primaries, chatted with Elizabeth Taylor backstage at a Gridiron Club dinner (she was married to Sen. John Warner of Virginia at the time), spoke Polish with Pope John Paul II in the White House, and interviewed Eleanor Roosevelt (twice), Brooke Shields, and former heavyweight boxing champions Jack Dempsey and Rocky Marciano. Knap worked with Brooke Shields on her highly successful American Lung Association campaign against cigarette smoking by young people. He interviewed Shields after she appeared before a Congressional committee, and wrote about why to quit and how to quit. Shields sent him a \\"thank you\\" note on a full-size poster in a white jumpsuit with two cigarettes sticking out of her ears. Before dawn on a cold November 25, 1963, Knap went to the Capitol grounds to interview people waiting to view President Kennedy's casket in the Rotunda. There he met another ex-champ, Jersey Joe Walcott. On a hot August 28, 1963, Knap joined the civil rights march from the Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial, where he covered Martin Luther King Jr.'s \\"I have a dream\\" speech. \\"And I got paid to do all that,\\" Knap exclaimed. Knap was born in Milwaukee on May 19, 1920 of Polish immigrant parents whose five children were the first in their factory-workers' neighborhood to go to college. He graduated from Marquette University in 1940 with a Bachelor of Philosophy degree in journalism. Before and after serving in the United States Army for four years during World War II, Knap worked for six years for the Waukesha, Wisconsin Daily Freeman as a reporter and then as city editor. He moved to Indianapolis in 1950, where he went to work for the Indianapolis Times, a Scripps Howard newspaper. He became the Times' star reporter, winning numerous awards and, among other things, exposing a major highway scandal that sent three state officials to prison. After almost 13 years in Indianapolis, Knap was sent to Washington as correspondent for the Indianapolis Times and the Evansville (Indiana) Press, another Scripps Howard paper. Three years later, in 1966, he was promoted to the Scripps Howard national staff. Knap was president of the White House Correspondents Association in 1973‚Äì74, a turbulent period that included Watergate, impeachment proceedings, resignation, pardon, and a new president. Knap caused some controversy over one White House dinner when, with Vice President Ford attending, he proposed a toast to \\"the President and Vice President.\\" This violated the tradition of toasting the President alone, but Knap wished to avoid the scandal that might have occurred if a toast to President Nixon alone brought boos from the hard-drinking crowd. In 1973 Knap began the weekly \\"White House Watch\\" column, now written by his successor as Scripps Howard's White House correspondent, and syndicated to more than 400 newspapers. In May 1972, Nixon spent a week in the Kremlin negotiating the first nuclear arms reduction treaty with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. When agreement was finally reached, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger briefed the press at midnight in a Moscow nightclub that had been converted into press headquarters. When Knap finished writing at 4 a.m., he saw daylight breaking and realized that \\"I had worked straight through my birthday‚Äîand the loudspeaker announced that the press bus was leaving at 5 o'clock for the flight to Leningrad.‚Äù President Nixon and Knap at the White House Correspondents dinner.Knap has stated that he doesn't know how he got on Nixon's enemies list, \\"not that I mind.\\" Patrick Buchanan, Nixon's speech writer, told Knap that he should have been supportive of Nixon because Scripps Howard had endorsed Nixon. Alternatively, according to Knap, \\"it may have been because I pestered Nixon at every opportunity with questions about his so- called 'secret plan' to end the war in Vietnam; I finally concluded that it was simply 'declare victory and get out.'\\" Nevertheless, Knap gave Nixon credit in his column for foreign policy (the open door to China), national security (the START treaty) and several progressive domestic issues, including the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency, and federal aid to education, \\"which previously had been anathema to Republicans.\\" In Knap's opinion \\"Nixon, unlike Reagan, thought government could be the solution.‚Äù Ted Knap at 94.On Knap's den wall today are pictures of him with nine presidents, from Truman to George H.W. Bush, not all of whom were president at the time of the photograph. Also on the wall is a picture of Knap and Nixon sitting on the back steps of the Behrens Spa Hotel in Waukesha in 1950. Nixon had just made his \\"pumpkin papers\\" speech (concerning Whittaker Chambers, Alger Hiss, and allegations of spying for the Soviet Union, using secret microfilms hidden in a pumpkin patch) and Knap wanted him to go over some details of that story. Another picture shows Knap and Nixon 23 years later at a White House Correspondents' Dinner. Honors and awards include induction into the Indiana Journalism Hall of Fame in 2007, the American Political Science Association (twice), the Marquette University By-Line Award, Sigma Delta Chi fraternity, and Indianapolis Press Club reporting awards. Knap was married to Eleanore Knoebel of Waukesha, WI, who died in 2011. Knap retired in 1985 and has continued his devotion to golf. He won the Seniors' Championship at the International Country Club (Virginia) three times. At other courses, he broke 70 twice in a row. In other athletic triumphs, Knap scored what he claims was the winning goal for Marquette University in a hockey game against the University of Wisconsin in 1939. After living in McLean, VA for many years, he now resides in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin. Ted Knap's older brother was Tony Knap, American football coach, who died in October 2011, at age 96.

Brig. Gen. B D Pritchard Benjamin Dudley Pritchard (January 29, 1835 - November 26, 1907) was a United States Army officer, most known for leading the Union cavalry regiment which captured the fugitive Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America, in the weeks surrounding the close of the American Civil War. Early life and career Benjamin Pritchard was born to Lambert and Zulpha (Adams) Pritchard in rural Nelson, Ohio. Pritchard worked in the carpentry and cabinet-making trade until he had earned and saved enough money to enroll at Hiram College, where his instructor was James A. Garfield (who would later serve as United States President). He studied penmanship under the Spencer Brothers, whose father had invented the Spencerian Script. Following his work at Hiram College, in 1856, Pritchard went to Allegan, Michigan, where he studied law under the tutelage of Judge W. B. Williams and taught for Allegan Public Schools at a salary of $240 per year. In 1858, he continued his studies at the University of Michigan, graduating and achieving admittance to the bar in 1860. Upon his return to Allegan, he partnered with Judge Williams to established a law practice. Civil War In 1862, Pritchard and Judge Williams both enlisted in the Union Army. Pritchard entered the 4th Michigan Cavalry, Company L, as a captain. Following the Battle of Chickamauga (September 30 - October 3, 1863), he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. On September 1, 1864, while on a short leave, Pritchard traveled to Chagrin Falls, Ohio, where he was married to Mary Bently Kent. They honeymooned in Allegan at Judge Williams's home before Pritchard returned to his regiment. Meanwhile, his new bride was in a train wreck and subsequently had to use a wheelchair, after which she took up the art of painting. Upon Pritchard's discharge, they set up residence at 330 Davis Street in what is now part of Allegan's historic district. =Rise to military fame= At Abbeyville, Georgia, 70 miles south of Macon, it was learned that Davis's fleeing party had crossed the ferry over the Ocmulgee River and was moving southward toward Irwinville, 30 miles below Abbeyville and 100 miles south of Macon. Lieutenant Colonel Pritchard, in command of the 4th Michigan Cavalry, marched the regiment rapidly down the river road, and, after a 30-mile ride, reached Irwinville late in the night. There, he learned that he was now in advance of the Davis party. One of Pritchard's officers, Corp. George Munger (of Allegan, Michigan), soon discovered the Confederate president's encampment. He noticed two women moving rapidly away from the camp as the 4th Michigan approached and thought they looked suspicious, so he stopped them and asked that they remove their cloaks. Upon so doing, it was revealed that the two \\"women\\" were Jefferson Davis and his wife, both wearing women's cloaks and shawls trying to escape capture. (The cloak and shawl worn by the Confederate president are now the property of the National Archives.) Davis later wrote of the event: ‚ÄúI had gone perhaps fifteen yards when a trooper galloped up and ordered me to halt and surrender to which I gave a defiant answer. He leveled his carbine at me but I expected if he fired he would miss. My intention was to put my hand under his foot, tumble him off on the other side, spring into his saddle and escape.\\".Paul D. Mehney, \\"Capturing a Confederate,\\" Michigan History Magazine (May/June 2000) A number of cartoons and mockery songs appeared in the public during the weeks and months that followed, chiding Davis for the attire he was captured in. P. T. Barnum even made a giant-sized replica of \\"Davis in drag.\\"The Life and Times of General B. D. Pritchard by James J. Green (Allegan: Allegan County Historical Society, 1979), ppg. 17. Pritchard insisted on giving thorough credit to all who played a role in the capture. He worked on the report for 48 straight hours, closing it with a recommendation that the following men receive brevet promotions: > \\"Captain Hathaway, commanding that part of the regiment picketing the river; > Captain Charles Hudson, in command of Advance Guard of fourteen picked men > who led the column into the Camp; Lieutenant Silas A. Stauber and Henry S. > Boutell who were commanding fifty men in each detachment, the latter of whom > was severely wounded while gallantly leading his men; Lieutenant A.

D. Pritchard by James > J. Green (Allegan: Allegan County Historical Society, 1979), ppg. 14-15. As his reward for making the capture, Colonel Pritchard was brevetted out of service as a brigadier general (and the larger pension that came with that rank) and a $3000 share of the bounty which President Johnson offered for Davis's apprehension (1868 Draft #2186 drawn on Warrant #3749). After the war Following the war, the now-famous national hero returned to Allegan, where he resumed his law partnership with Judge Williams, continuing the practice until 1868. He and Mary had a daughter--Bertha Edna--on September 24, 1869, and a son--Harry--on August 5, 1873. Pritchard supported several churches, but he and his family made Allegan First Congregational Church their place of worship. Pritchard turned down the nomination for Governor of Michigan in 1884, deferring to and supporting the incumbent, David Jerome of Saginaw. He was strongly encouraged to run for Congress, but declined in favor of continuing his term on the Allegan School Board, which position he held for many years as the only elected local post he was willing to serve from. He did, however, serve two terms of office as the State Treasurer of Michigan from 1880 to 1884. As School Board Director, Pritchard had three new elementary schools built and annexed to North Ward school, which had stood as an autonomous district, and organized Allegan's first high school, which graduated its first class in 1876 (dubbed the Centennial Class due to its coincidence with the Nation's 100th birthday). The school had a staff of two, both of whom taught, and one of whom simultaneously served as the schools superintendent and principal. In 1870, Pritchard organized the First National Bank of Allegan and served as its president until 1905. He then relinquished his shares in that bank and founded the First State Bank, which was the first bank in the county to be anointed as a state depository. It was also the first savings bank, offering 4% interest to depositors, and the first bank to install safety deposit boxes. Death and burial His family reports that he began experiencing consistent chest pains around November 12, 1907. On Sunday, November 24, his family physician examined him, finding nothing wrong with Pritchard. He went to work the following day, as usual, but was stricken with acute angina pectoris at home that evening. His physician was called in and morphine was administered, but it took two hours for the pain to subside. He didn't report to work Tuesday, November 26,--the first day he had taken off in forty years. At about 5:30 p.m., he told his daughter that he was feeling fine and suggested she go rest. Before she could leave the room, he gasped, and his life was over. Since none outside his immediate family had been given an indication of his illness, the news of his apparently sudden death sent a shockwave across the state as the loss of one of its greatest heroes was mourned. Pritchard was interred in Oakwood Cemetery (Allegan) on November 29, 1907, the Grand Army of the Republic, the Rev. William Lucas of the local Episcopal Church, and the Rev. A. V. Brashear of the local Presbyterian Church officiating. Over 600 attended the service.

The Board was established on 1 May 1949, and dissolved in 1973 when it became a region of the British Gas Corporation. Problems arising from nationalising part of the British gas industry The first chairman of the board was Sir Andrew Clow who established the headquarters at 25 Drumsheugh Gardens and 12 Rothesay Terrace Edinburgh. He served until 30 April 1956. In the last of his quarterly letters to his senior management, he reflected on the experience of centralising the control of over two hundred independent undertakings. The remainder of the article is abstracted from that letter and includes explanatory remarks. =Functions of gas undertakings= Each undertaking performed the functions of coal gas production and distribution through underground pipes to domestic, commercial and industrial customers, sales promotion, finance, etc. Some works were too small to remain viable and one at Wigton was closed. Studies were conducted to establish whether previously rival works could be integrated, both managerially and physically by linking their distribution systems. =Ownership of Scottish gas undertakings= Most of the larger gas undertakings had been owned by local authorities and employed many expert and talented engineers. However the same authorities were also owners of electricity generating and supply companies (the main rivals of the gas industry); the local authorities had felt no need to promote competition. =Post-war issues= Immediately after World War II there was a chronic shortage of pipes (for mains replacement and extension to new customers), and other materials. Most gas pipes were made of cast iron and often leaked at the joints. Actual 'unaccounted for gas' (loss through leakage and other losses) was estimated as being as much as 25%. Refurbishment and replacement of pipes was a priority, for safety reasons. Little preventive work was carried out; distribution engineering was usually initiated by the detection of a leak. Many gas works had not been adequately maintained, the price of coal and of coke oven gas was rising, contractors were in short supply and the Scottish rating system at that time was such that 'profits might prove as damaging as losses'. =Cost-based pricing= Regarding gas tariffs, the chairman wrote \\"we must keep the allocation of charges between customers fairly close to our estimate of their individual costs and we do not have the freedom of private companies to discriminate between customers whose conditions are similar.\\" This was a reference to the notion that pricing of state-owned produce should reflect cost as accurately as possible. This was in very sharp contrast to the free market concept of charging 'what the market will bear' i.e. the highest price that still enables sufficient competitive advantage to retain that customer. =Losing market share= Gas was losing share of the industrial market in Scotland because of falling oil prices. One of the largest refinery sites in the country was located almost at the centre of the industrial belt. Domestic customers were becoming ever more sensitive to the price of gas as electric heating, in various forms, became relatively cheaper. New house building after the war was on an unprecedented scale on mainly green-field sites beyond the reach of gas mains. Government rules about return on investment often made mains extension impossible, again to the detriment of suppliers of gas versus electricity. =Personnel problems= While the chairman was confident about the technical expertise of the staff he had inherited, he recognised that, unlike the previous owners, it was necessary to promote gas sales by 'educational advertisement and display, canvassing and salesmanship' and by making 'more contact with domestic customers, local authorities and various personalities'. The industry had, hitherto, been managed mainly by professional engineers, whose aim was to produce and distribute gas as cheaply as possible, bearing in mind that, in the interest of safety, demand had to be met at all times. =Managerial priorities= A failure to supply for any reason had dire consequences. Not only might it entail prosecution for breach of statutory responsibilities, but restoration of supply required, and still requires, every home to be visited to ensure that all gas taps are turned off (including the main supply to the premises). The procedure then requires pipes to be purged to ensure that any explosive mixture of gas and air is removed before the main is pressurised again. Finally, every household had to be visited again to ensure safe restoration of supply. Consequently, the engineer manager was more concerned about ensuring continuity of supply and with balancing supply with demand on an hourly basis. The notion that in addition to performing his delicate task, he would have to 'sell' gas by making personal contact with potential customers was unusual. The chairman admitted that \\"the great amount of work that re-organisation has involved has also had some effect, especially in the bigger places, in leaving Managers too little time to move around and to have frequent and close contact with others at work, whether they are stokers or typists, or mainlayers or meter readers in whatever capacity they serve\\". Customer contact not mentioned. =Industrial relations= The chairman remarked on the good relations the Board had with the trade unions and, although he welcomed increasing wages, he deplored the fact that wage negotiations were conducted at national level (by the Gas Council) and that wage awards were \\"above what the cost of living and our (Scottish) position justified.\\" He regretted that he had to mark his departure with a concomitant rise in gas prices. =Last thoughts= The chairman concluded his account by remarking that \\"... a first class plant, first class gas and coke, a first class office and showroom, a first class financial system are all admirable. But these and many more gadgets in the machine will be of little value unless those using them add to their professional competence a sense of vocation and an anxiety to brighten up what Wordsworth calls 'the still, sad music of humanity.'\\" =Undertakings in Scotland vested at nationalisation= The Board took over the following local authority and privately owned gas production and supply utilities: * Aberdeen Corporation (County of the City of Aberdeen) * Aberlady and Gullane Gas Company * Airdrie Burgh Corporation * Alloa Burgh Corporation * Alyth Gas Light Company * Arbroath Burgh Corporation * Ardrossan Burgh Corporation * Auchinleck Gas Light Company * Auchterarder Gas Light Company * Auchtermuchty Gas Company * Ayr Gas Company * Ayton Gas Company * Banchory Gas Light Company * Banff and Macduff District Gas Company * Barrhead Gas Company * Beith Gas Light Company * Blairgowrie Gas Light Company * Bo'ness Gas Light Company * Bridge of Weir Gas Company * Broxburn Gas Company * Buckhaven and Leven Gas Commissioners * Burntisland Burgh Corporation * Busby and District Gas Company * Callander Gas Company * Campbeltown Burgh Corporation * Cardenden Gas Company * Carnoustie Burgh Corporation * Castle-Douglas Gas Company * Catrine Gas Company * Coatbridge Burgh Gas Company * Coldstream Gas Company * Coltness Iron Company * Coupar Angus Gas Company * Cove and Kilcreggan Burgh Corporation * Cowdenbeath Gas Company * Crieff Gas-Light Company * Cullen District Gas Company * Cumnock Gas Company * Cupar Gas Company * Dalbeattie Gas Light Company * Dalkeith Gas Light Company * Dalry Gas Light Company * Darvel Burgh Corporation * Denny and Dunipace Burgh Corporation * Dingwall Burgh Corporation * Dollar Gas Company * Doune Burgh Corporation * Dumbarton Burgh Corporation * Dumfries Burgh Corporation * Dunbar Burgh Corporation * Dunblane Gas Company * Dundee Corporation (County of the City of Dundee) * Dunfermline Burgh Corporation * Dunlop Gas Light Company * Dunning Gas Company * Dunoon Burgh Corporation * Duns Gas Company * Earlston Gas Company * East Linton Gas Light Company * Edinburgh Corporation (County of the City of Edinburgh) * Elgin Burgh Corporation * Eyemouth Gas Company * F.

The single went straight to the number one position in South Korea. The single and its album launched Rain as an international artist throughout Asia in 2005. Both reached number one in several places, including Vietnam, Taiwan, Thailand, China, Shanghai, and Hong Kong. With this single, Rain presented a brand-new image to his fans, and explored a more upbeat, hip- hop influenced sound. In an attempt to attract a larger international audience, he changed his name from Bi (meaning ‚Äòrain‚Äô in Korean) to its English form, Rain. This was also Rain's first single with an English name, rather than a Korean one. The single eventually made its way to the MTV studios in 2006. Its video was played periodically on MTV (USA) to promote Rain‚Äôs first ever US concert, Rainy Day, in Madison Square Garden. Lyrics The song begins: :\\"Îã§Ïãú Ïò¨ÎùºÏÑ† Î¨¥ÎåÄ Ï°∞Î™ÖÏù¥ ÎÇ† ÎπÑÏ∂îÎ©¥ ÎÇú Ï°∞Í∏àÏî©, ÏÇ¨ÎûåÎì§Ïùò Ìï®ÏÑ±Ïù¥ ÎÇòÏùò Ïù¥Î¶ÑÏùÑ Î∂àÎü¨Ï£ºÎ©¥ ÎÇú Ï°∞Í∏àÏî©\\" :\\"Dasi ollaseon mudae jomyeong-i nal bichumyeon nan jogeumssig, saramdeul-ui hamseong-i naui ireum-eul bulleojumyeon nan jogeumssig\\" After this the backing singers sing \\"(rain go rain it's raining it's raining)\\". Music video In the music video for \\"It's Raining\\", Rain is delivered to a night club for a live performance by his entourage, bringing some life to the previously dull atmosphere. Towards the end of the song, rain starts to pour from the ceiling. Parts of the video appear to have been shot in front of fans. On the music video, instead of the woman saying \\"Rain, Go Rain!, It's Raining, It's Raining\\", you would hear Rain saying the side verse. Korean promo single A commercial single of It‚Äôs Raining was never released. However, promos were sent out to TV and radio stations containing one track, It's Raining [Radio Edit].

Overview Hurra Deutschland was easily distinguished because of its use of rubber puppets modelled on politicians and celebrities, who were poked fun at in various sketches. The puppets were built out of latex by GUM Studios, who continue to make puppets even today (many of which were used in the new series). The show was chiefly political in nature, with the main character undoubtedly being a bumbling and moronic Helmut Kohl, with supporting characters Willy Brandt, Hans-Jochen Vogel, Hans-Dietrich Genscher etc. Puppets from the German popular culture entered the ensemble to public appraisal, such as entertainer Thomas Gottschalk, singer Heino and tennis player Boris Becker. New Series A new edition entitled \\"Hurra Deutschland - Jetzt erst recht!\\" (Literally: \\"Hurrah Germany - Now more than ever!\\") ran from June 23, 2003 to July 23, 2004. The show was \\"hosted\\" by puppets of Dieter Bohlen and Daniel Kublbock. However, general critical opinion was that the new series lacked the mordacity and audacity that the old one had - another complaint was that it focused too much on celebrities and sporting figures, whereas the original was so popular as a political series. The remake was cancelled after just one season. Inspiration The show was modelled on the long-running British series Spitting Image, where many prominent personalities were also parodied with rubber puppets. The show took many key inspirations from its British predecessor, including use of film parody sketches and musical numbers.

Brain and published by Jaleco. Plot During a walk with his girlfriend, the player is ambushed by agents of a mysterious crime syndicate who take his girlfriend away and shoot him to death. Now, as a wandering spirit with the ability to possess most others, he is summoned by his girlfriend's father (who researches ghost energy) and is given a mission to save her from the mysterious crime syndicate that holds her hostage, enabling the player to rest in peace. Screenshot of Avenging Spirit As it turns out, the crime syndicate is also researching ghost energy, and they kidnapped the girl in an effort to force her father to cooperate with them. The player must fight through 6 stages to infiltrate the evil syndicate's base, collecting three keys on stages 2, 5, and 6. If the player has all three keys upon reaching the final leg of Stage 6, he can open the girl's cell and possess her to help her fight her way out. If not, he must abandon her and face the syndicate's leader alone. After the syndicate's leader is defeated, the base blows up, and the player ends up on a grassy field as his spirit's power fades. If the player failed to save the girl she [probably] dies in the explosion and he expects to see her in afterlife as he fades away. If the player did save her, she comes to on said grassy field, and the player expresses a wish for her future happiness as he vanishes. Gameplay Players can possess one of four characters with unique abilities at the start of the game, but the library of enemies expands and changes with each level. Players attack (or possess) enemies, collect power-ups, and defeat bosses to advance.  Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Avenging Spirit on their July 1, 1991 issue as being the seventeenth most-successful table arcade unit of the year. Sinclair User called Avenging Spirit a \\"superior action game with a rather odd scenario.\\" They praised the longevity of the game but admitted that it had a steep learning curve that might not appeal to more casual players. British gaming magazine The One reviewed Avenging Spirit in 1991, stating that it \\"isn't destined to be a classic\\", but it has \\"originality and nice touches\\". Ports and re-releases On December 14, 2010, DotEmu released an iOS port of the game on the Apple AppStore. The Game Boy version was re- released on the Nintendo eShop's Virtual Console download service on August 11, 2011.

Nearby places of interest  Bosherston is known for Broad Haven South beach and the Bosherston lily ponds; both owned and maintained by the National Trust.Bosherston Lily Ponds - Freshwater magic walk, nationaltrust.org.uk Two miles to the south of Bosherston nestled between the steep cliffs of the south Pembrokeshire coastline is St Govan's Chapel. It is free to visit, although the only access is down steep steps carved into the side of the cliff.  Bosherston Church  The small parish church of St. Michael and All Angels is a grade II* listed Norman church of the late 13th century, built on the site of a former church. The building is in the form of a cross, having north and south transepts. Since its restoration by the Cawdor family in 1855, its highbacked old pews have disappeared and its Norman windows have been replaced by those of later Gothic design. Under the North Transept window there is the tomb of a Dowager Duchess of Buckingham, an antecedent of the Duke of Norfolk. The fact that she was a widow may be gathered from the veil and cloak shown on the figure carved on the tomb. That she was of noble birth can be seen by the coronet on her head and the dog at her feet. Under the South Transept window there is a stone tomb surmounted by a figure depicting a Crusader. It is thought to have been carved in the 14th century. On the North wall of the church there are brass tablets commemorating the men of the parish who lost their lives in the First World War, those who served in the Armed Forces in the Second World War and a coastguard killed on duty.

All microorganisms, with a few exceptions, have highly conserved DNA sequences in their genome that are transcribed and translated to efflux pumps. Efflux pumps are capable of moving a variety of different toxic compounds out of cells, such as antibiotics, heavy metals, organic pollutants, plant-produced compounds, quorum sensing signals, bacterial metabolites and neurotransmitters via active efflux, which is vital part for xenobiotic metabolism. This active efflux mechanism is responsible for various types of resistance to bacterial pathogens within bacterial species - the most concerning being antibiotic resistance because microorganisms can have adapted efflux pumps to divert toxins out of the cytoplasm and into extracellular media. Efflux systems function via an energy-dependent mechanism (active transport) to pump out unwanted toxic substances through specific efflux pumps. Some efflux systems are drug-specific, whereas others may accommodate multiple drugs with small multidrug resistance (SMR) transporters. Efflux pumps are proteinaceous transporters localized in the cytoplasmic membrane of all kinds of cells. They are active transporters, meaning that they require a source of chemical energy to perform their function. Some are primary active transporters utilizing adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis as a source of energy, whereas others are secondary active transporters (uniporters, symporters, or antiporters) in which transport is coupled to an electrochemical potential difference created by pumping hydrogen or sodium ions into the cell.  Bacterial  Bacterial efflux transporters are classified into five major superfamilies, based on their amino acid sequence and the energy source used to export their substrates: # The major facilitator superfamily (MFS) # The ATP-binding cassette superfamily (ABC) # The small multidrug resistance family (SMR) # The resistance-nodulation-cell division superfamily (RND) # The multi antimicrobial extrusion protein family (MATE). Of these, only the ABC superfamily are primary transporters, the rest being secondary transporters utilizing proton or sodium gradient as a source of energy. Whereas MFS dominates in Gram positive bacteria, the RND family was once thought to be unique to Gram negative bacteria. They have since been found in all major kingdoms. = Structure = Efflux pumps generally consist of an outer membrane protein, middle periplasmic protein, inner membrane protein, and transmembrane duct. The transmembrane duct is located in the outer membrane of the cell. The duct is also bound to two other proteins: a periplasmic membrane protein and an integral membrane transporter. The periplasmic membrane protein and the inner membrane protein of the system are coupled to control the opening and closing of the duct (channel). When a toxin binds to this inner membrane protein, the inner membrane proteins gives rise to a biochemical cascade that transmits signals to the periplasmic membrane protein and outer membrane protein to open the channel and move the toxin out of the cell. This mechanism uses an energy-dependent, protein-protein interaction that is generated by the transfer of the toxin for an H+ ion by the inner membrane transporter. = Function = Although antibiotics are the most clinically important substrates of efflux systems, it is probable that most efflux pumps have other natural physiological functions. Examples include: * The E. coli AcrAB efflux system, which has a physiologic role of pumping out bile acids and fatty acids to lower their toxicity. * The MFS family Ptr pump in Streptomyces pristinaespiralis appears to be an autoimmunity pump for this organism when it turns on production of pristinamycins I and II. * The AcrAB‚ÄìTolC system in E. coli is suspected to have a role in the transport of the calcium-channel components in the E. coli membrane. * The MtrCDE system plays a protective role by providing resistance to faecal lipids in rectal isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. * The AcrAB efflux system of Erwinia amylovora is important for this organism's virulence, plant (host) colonization, and resistance to plant toxins. * The MexXY component of the MexXY-OprM multidrug efflux system of P. aeruginosa is inducible by antibiotics that target ribosomes via the PA5471 gene product. The ability of efflux systems to recognize a large number of compounds other than their natural substrates is probably because substrate recognition is based on physicochemical properties, such as hydrophobicity, aromaticity and ionizable character rather than on defined chemical properties, as in classical enzyme- substrate or ligand-receptor recognition. Because most antibiotics are amphiphilic molecules - possessing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic characters - they are easily recognized by many efflux pumps. =Impact on antimicrobial resistance= The impact of efflux mechanisms on antimicrobial resistance is large; this is usually attributed to the following: * The genetic elements encoding efflux pumps may be encoded on chromosomes and/or plasmids, thus contributing to both intrinsic (natural) and acquired resistance respectively. As an intrinsic mechanism of resistance, efflux pump genes can survive a hostile environment (for example in the presence of antibiotics) which allows for the selection of mutants that over-express these genes. Being located on transportable genetic elements as plasmids or transposons is also advantageous for the microorganisms as it allows for the easy spread of efflux genes between distant species. * Antibiotics can act as inducers and regulators of the expression of some efflux pumps. * Expression of several efflux pumps in a given bacterial species may lead to a broad spectrum of resistance when considering the shared substrates of some multi-drug efflux pumps, where one efflux pump may confer resistance to a wide range of antimicrobials.  Eukaryotic  In eukaryotic cells, the existence of efflux pumps has been known since the discovery of P-glycoprotein in 1976 by Juliano and Ling. Efflux pumps are one of the major causes of anticancer drug resistance in eukaryotic cells. They include monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), multiple drug resistance proteins (MDRs)- also referred as P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs), peptide transporters (PEPTs), and Na+ phosphate transporters (NPTs). These transporters are distributed along particular portions of the renal proximal tubule, intestine, liver, blood‚Äìbrain barrier, and other portions of the brain.  Inhibitors  Several trials are currently being conducted to develop drugs that can be co- administered with antibiotics to act as inhibitors for the efflux-mediated extrusion of antibiotics. As yet, no efflux inhibitor has been approved for therapeutic use, but some are being used to determine the prevalence of efflux pumps in clinical isolates and in cell biology research. Verapamil, for example, is used to block P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux of DNA-binding fluorophores, thereby facilitating fluorescent cell sorting for DNA content. Various natural products have been shown to inhibit bacterial efflux pumps including the carotenoids capsanthin and capsorubin, the flavonoids rotenone and chrysin, and the alkaloid lysergol. Some nanoparticles, for example zinc oxide, also inhibit bacterial efflux pumps.

He served on the Council of Keewatin the governing body of the District of Keewatin from 1876 to 1877. He was born in England or Scotland in 1813 and came to Upper Canada in 1832. He entered the business of forwarding goods at Chippawa in the Niagara region. He later moved to Queenston where he became a customs collector and a notary public. He formed a forwarding company there in partnership with James Hamilton. He was elected to the council for the Niagara District and then to the council for Niagara Township, where he was chosen to be reeve. He moved to Clifton (later Niagara Falls) in 1851 where he served several terms as postmaster and became the town's first mayor. In 1857, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada for Welland. He was appointed excise officer in Windsor in 1864. Later that year, he was named stipendiary magistrate and justice of the peace throughout Canada West. McMicken was charged with collecting intelligence for the government during the period leading up to the Fenian raids. His injection of spies into the Fenian organization helped defuse this threat. In 1869, he was named commissioner for the Dominion Police, later merged into the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. In 1871, he went to Winnipeg to help establish government offices there. McMicken took on the role of lands agent and had to deal with the thorny problem of distributing land in Manitoba. He later lobbied for the incorporation of Winnipeg as a town and helped keep it on the route chosen for the transcontinental railroad. McMicken was appointed to the Council of Keewatin serving as one of six members appointed on November 25, 1876. He served on the council until he was asked to resign along with the rest of the council April 16, 1877 In 1879, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba. He served as speaker for the provincial assembly from 1880 to 1882. He also served on the council for the University of Manitoba. He supplemented his pension income by working as an insurance agent in Winnipeg. He died there in 1891.

In 1807, they organized and built a structure on 5,000 acres (20 km¬≤) of land they purchased from heirs of Major-General Nathanael Greene, who had received the land as part of a 25,000-acre (100 km¬≤) American Revolutionary War land grant. The original building was replaced with a brick structure in 1813. The present building was constructed in the Greek Revival style by members and their slaves using brick, limestone, and timber. The architectural styling features stepped gables and a recessed open vestibule. A gallery was also provided for slaves to attend service. In the 1880s, Tiffany Stained Glass windows were added to the church building. Cemetery With over 1,500 graves, the Zion Presbyterian Church cemetery of is also of historical significance.

They were built by General Motors Diesel (GMD) of Canada as a narrow-gauge version of the EMD G8 model, with seventeen locomotives constructed. Ten of these were later rebuilt into the DBR class.  Introduction  The DB class was introduced to the rail network in 1965-1966 as a result of a requirement for a modern locomotive that could operate on the North Island lines that the DA class was excluded from due to their weight and axle load. They were ordered at the same time as the final DA order was placed. While these were mainly branch lines, it also applied to the East Coast Main Trunk line, particularly the section beyond Paeroa through the Karangahake and Athenree gorges until the opening of the Kaimai Tunnel in 1978. The class was virtually indistinguishable externally from the DA class, being of the same basic design and dimensions, and wearing the same livery. They were some 13 tonnes lighter with a V8 prime as opposed to a V12, though they shared the same A1A-A1A wheel configuration and traction motors for commonality with the DA fleet. = Numbering = The class was initially numbered DB 1000 to DB 1016, this being in common with NZR practice of the time to number locomotive classes with reference to the power output. Upon the introduction of the computerised Traffic Monitoring System (TMS) in 1979 the class was renumbered and the designation capitalised. The class received new four-digit numbers beginning with 1, in which the last number is a check digit for the whole number. Under the new system DB 1001 retained its number, becoming DB 1001, with DB 1000 becoming DB1018. The rest of class was renumbered in sequence, with DB 1016 becoming DB1180. The units being rebuilt to DBR received a new TMS number in the 12XX range when they entered the rebuilding cycle. The exception to this was the first unit rebuilt, DB 1076, which retained its original designation for a number of years before being redesignated DBR and renumbered 1199.  Rebuild to DBR  DBR 1254 at Westfield, Auckland. In the late 1970s the decision was undertaken to rebuild the DB class along similar lines to that being undertaken for the DA class into the DC class. The rebuilt DB units were designated as DBR (R = rebuild). The work was undertaken by Clyde Engineering in Australia and involved the lowering of the short hood to improve visibility for the driver, new cabs and the installation of a new EMD 8-645 engine. Ten units were rebuilt between 1980 and 1982.  In service  The DB class was employed primarily freight duties, though they did also see occasional service hauling passenger trains. As lines and bridges were upgraded, and in the case of the ECMT the Kaimai Tunnel opening, the weight advantage the locomotives had over other classes used in the North Island became less of a factor and the locomotives were operated as part of a general pool. The lightweight nature of the locomotives was called upon again however to operate some South Island lines following the withdrawal of the DI and DJ classes in the early 1990s. The last DBR returned north from the South Island around 2007. = Auckland Transport = From 2003 to 2014 two locomotives were leased to the Auckland Regional Transport Authority and then its successor, Auckland Transport, with the services operated under contract by Transdev. The two locomotives, DBRs 1199 and 1254 are operated in a top and tail configuration with the five car SX carriage set and wore the full MAXX Blue livery. A third unit, DBR 1226, was also painted in MAXX Blue but without the MAXX logo. DBR 1226 was usually used for freight services or work trains by KiwiRail but was used as back up for DBR 1199 or DBR 1254 as it had the necessary modifications to work with the suburban carriages. The leases expired in 2014 and the locomotives returned to freight service. = Wellington bankers = For many years two DBR class locomotives formed the basis of a banker set out of Wellington, primarily assisting trains between Wellington and Paekakariki but also performing multiple other jobs including the Hutt Workshops shunt, work trains around the region and any unusual movements. DBRs 1199 and 1200 were the initial pair, becoming known as the \\"Bobsy Twins\\" (sp), likely a reference to the Bobbsey Twins due mainly to their consecutive numbers (a rarity under the TMS numbering system). In the early 2000s DBR 1199 suffered a failure and was withdrawn from service and laid up, replaced on the banker set by DBR 1267. DBR 1199 was later sent to Hillside for repair and use on the Auckland SX set commuter trains, by which time the pairing of DBRs 1200 and 1267 had become known simply as \\"The Twins\\". Following prolonged electrical trouble, in July 2013 DBR 1200 was taken out of service, and was replaced with other locomotives that were available. DBR 1267 was later transferred to Auckland to replace DBR 1282, with the Wellington banking role taken over by other locomotives. = Livery = The locomotives were delivered in the same overall deep red livery as the DA class, with the same white stripes along the sides and \\"wings\\" on the ends. With the introduction of TMS the locomotives road numbers were applied in large white numbers to the long hoods. This livery was worn by many of the original DBs until their retirement, while the DBRs were returned to service in the International Orange or \\"Fruit Salad\\" scheme (red and grey with yellow safety ends) being applied to most NZR locomotive classes at the time. DBs 1082 and 1099 also received this livery in the 1980s. DBR 1295 was repainted into the Toll Rail \\"Corn Cob\\" scheme (yellow and green), and the three units used on Auckland services have received the MAXX Blue livery (deep blue and yellow). More recently DBR 1267 has received the KiwiRail grey, red and yellow scheme.  Withdrawal and disposal  DBR 1267 at Whangarei As of , all units have been withdrawn from service. The locomotives were withdrawn on account of being either surplus to requirements, or in poor mechanical condition. All of the DB locomotives were withdrawn by . In the early 2000s, DBRs 1199, 1239 and 1241 were withdrawn and placed into storage at Hutt Workshops. However, 1199 was reinstated a year later for suburban trains in Auckland, and 1239 and 1241 were scrapped at Hutt Workshops in February 2008. More withdrawals commenced in , with 1200 being the first. A few more were laid-up over the next few months. In , 1267, 1282 and 1295 were reinstated due to the DL class locomotives being taken out of service after samples from one locomotive tested positive for asbestos. Withdrawals began again in May of that year when 1282 was laid up. The rest have been withdrawn, with 1226 being the last. In June 2017, KiwiRail issued a Request for Quotation (RFQ) via the Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS). In August 2017, it was announced that DBRs 1254 and 1295 have been purchased by the Glenbrook Vintage Railway. The remaining DBRs were originally sold to an locomotive/rolling stock dealer in South Africa, but have now been sold to DBM Contracting.  Preservation  In August 2017, it was announced by the Glenbrook Vintage Railway that they had purchased DBRs 1254 and 1295 for eventually hauling mainline excursions. After being stored at Hutt Workshops, the pair arrived on-site on 3 November 2017. In March 2018, 1295 was repainted in the \\"International Orange\\" livery. In May 2018, work started on overhauling 1254 for mainline certification. Both have been given GVR numbers, which are No.11 and No.12 respectively. DBR 1254's restoration was completed in September 2019, and is now mainline certified.

They are majority Christians followed by Muslims. The Ambonese are from Ambon Island in Maluku, an island group east of Sulawesi and north of Timor in Indonesia. They also live on the southwest of Seram Island; which is part of the Moluccas, Java, New Guinea; on the West Papua side and other regions of Indonesia. Additionally, there are about 35,000 Ambonese people living in the Netherlands. By the end of the 20th century, there were 258,331 (2007 census) Ambonese people living in Ambon, Maluku. Language The predominant language of the island is Ambonese Malay, also called Ambonese. It developed as the trade language of central Maluku, and is spoken elsewhere in Maluku as a second language. Bilingualism in Indonesian is high around Ambon City. They are an ethnic mixture of Austronesians and the Melanesian people of New Guinea. Religion Oldest mosque in Ambon. The Ambonese religious views are divided approximately equal among Christians (Reformed Christianity) and Muslims (Sunni Islam); while indigenous customs such as tattooing have largely disappeared. According to Mikhail Anatolievich Chlenov, relationship between the adherents of both faiths here have traditionally been neighborly peaceful, based on the union of the communities' pela; which in the Ambonese language means \\"friend\\". However, he also mentions that clashes between Ambonese people and other non-indigenous ethnic groups occurs on religious grounds. Mounted tension then resulted in the 1998 inter-religious conflict in Ambon, of which until today the number of victims have turned into thousands of people. In the situation of an almost civil war, people were forced to move to refugee camps across the capital of the island, Ambon, Maluku, with lines dividing its Muslim and Christian sections were made. The problem is not completely resolved, and the religious issue is still acute, as indeed, in other parts of Indonesia. History A group of men after the institute of the M.P. in a church in Ambon, pre-1943. Ambon belonged to the so-called colonial ethnic group. They were formed in the 16th to 18th century as a result of the mixing of the indigenous population of Ambon Island and West Seram Regency, the human trade of the Hitu people, and with the immigrants from both other parts of Indonesia and Europeans. In the 15th to 16th century, the largest center of spice trade was established under the rule of the Sultanate of Ternate, and its capture then became the goal of the foreign colonialists, who at the beginning of the 16th century were the Portuguese colonials, and at the beginning of the 17th century the Dutch colonials. The Ambonese people resisted the Dutch colonization until the beginning of the 19th century. However, their resistance did not help in preventing the Dutch conquering the Malay Archipelago and suppressing uprisings of local ethnic groups against the colonialists. Due to its far- sighted policy, the Ambonese people have achieved a privileged position in Indonesia since the mid-19th century. Many of them were Europeanized, adopted Christianity, the wealthy townspeople were legally equated with the ruling colonizers, and they were involved in state and military services. For such loyalty, the Ambonese authorities were nicknamed \\"black Dutch\\". During the Indonesian National Revolution war for the Independence of Indonesia in 1945-1949, large groups of Ambonese people, especially members of the colonial army, emigrated to the Netherlands and New Guinea. Economy The arrival of the fishermen at Ambon, Maluku, pre-1919. At present, the Ambonese people are considered one of the most developed peoples of Indonesia, belong to the class of local intellectuals. Mostly engaged in the production for sale of spices such as carnation and nutmeg, as well as sago as a food source. Since the 17th century, they were producers of nutmeg; which led to the conquest of the Dutch colonial in Ambon Island and its surrounding region in 1605 as an attempt to monopolized the nutmeg trade, and finally the Amboyna massacre. Developed fishery, agriculture, horticulture and small trades are also means of earning a living. Ambonese craftsmen work in various industries such as pottery, blacksmithing, weapons making, shipbuilding, carving on tortoiseshell shell and mother of pearl, making ornamental crafts from buds of carnation, weaving boxes and mats from strips of palm leaves. Traditionally, they serve in the army and the administrative sector. Social structure A portrait of the King and his entourage in Ambon, Maluku, between 1890 and 1915. The Ambonese people live in traditional rural communities, called Negri and headed by a starosta called raja. Communities are divided into territorial-related groups called soa, which, in turn, unites the patrilineal clans that are called mata ruma. Marriages are concluded only within confessional groups. For the Ambonese people, they have been traditionally characterized by patrilocal marriage settlement. Relations between members of the community are regulated by traditional norms of behavior called adat, coming from the customs of the ancestors. Today the adat largely regulates matter on family, hereditary, land law, as well as on elections for leadership positions. Culture and lifestyle A group portrait of Ambonese people with musical instruments. A typical Ambonese village consists of about 1,500 people who live in houses made of materials from woven sago leaves or plastered bamboo, wood, coral stones, on stone foundations; they cultivate surrounding hillsides. Traditional rural settlements of Ambonese people are located on the shore and have a linear layout. Houses are built on stilts. =Clothings= Men adopted modern European style clothing, and only on special occasions they would wear short jackets and black trousers. Women also wear thin blouse or small- patterned sarong with black color for the older women and the younger women wear bright colored cotton dresses up to knee-length. =Food= The basis of the diet of Ambonese people is the porridge of sago starch, vegetables, taro, cassava, and fish. The inhabitants of the Ambon Island also have access to imported rice. =Music= The Ambonese people have rich musical folklore, many of which have absorbed many European musical elements, for example, the Ambonese quadrille (katreji) and the songs of the lagoon, accompanied by a violin and with a lap steel guitar. As of traditional musical instruments such as the 12 gongs, drums, bamboo flute (efluit), xylophone (tatabuhan kayu) and Aeolian harp are included.

Construction Construction of the OCR began in 1877 and the 27-km section to Hindon was opened in 1889. The line was completed to Middlemarch two years later. The 26 km section of line from Middlemarch to Hyde then opened in 1894. This was followed by the 16 km section from Hyde to Kokonga which opened in 1897. The section to Ranfurly opened in December 1898. The Ranfurly to Wedderburn section opened in 1900 followed by the Wedderburn to Ida Valley section which opened in 1901. The line was opened to Omakau in 1904. Omakau- Chatto Creek opened in July 1906 followed by the line reaching Alexandra in December 1906. The line was opened to Clyde in April 1907. There then followed a delay until the section through the Cromwell Gorge was resumed in 1914. The line reached Cromwell, 236 km, in 1921. The Clyde - Cromwell section (20 km) was closed in 1980 due to construction of the Clyde Dam, a hydro-electric power station in the Cromwell Gorge on the Clutha River. The dam flooded the gorge, through which the line ran, to form Lake Dunstan. Topography The branch begins at Wingatui railway station on the Main South Line south of Dunedin. After the branch line closed, the first four kilometres were retained in the national railway network as a service line to local industries. The Dunedin Railways (formerly known as 'Taieri Gorge Railway') line officially begins at the 4 km peg and shortly thereafter passes around a spectacular horseshoe curve at the foot of the Salisbury bank and begins a climb at 1 in 50 to the summit at 145 m, where it passes through the long Salisbury Tunnel, the longest on the line. After a second tunnel, the railway runs along Mullocky Gully, crossing it over the long Wingatui Viaduct, before joining the Taieri Gorge. Wingatui Viaduct has been the largest wrought iron structure in New Zealand since it was built in 1887 and is the longest and tallest (47 m) bridge on the line. The railway remains in the Taieri Gorge for 25 km, crossing 16 major bridges with a total length of 1020m and passing through 10 tunnels with a total length of 1491m. Wingatui Viaduct under construction Further notable viaducts along the way are Christmas Creek Viaduct, one of the curved viaducts, Deep Stream Viaduct, and Flat Stream Viaduct, also curved. Just before Hindon station, the railway tracks share a combined road-rail bridge with Hindon Road, a local backroad. After Flat Stream Viaduct, the aptly named \\"The Notches\\" section also presented an engineering challenge, accomplished via three short bridges and cuttings through several rocky outcrops. In the second half of the gorge section the line climbs steadily to exit the gorge at Pukerangi (45 km, 254 m altitude) and then descends into the Strath Taieri plateau before reaching Middlemarch at 64 km. On the remaining line between Wingatui and Middlemarch, passing loops exist at North Taieri and Parera, service sidings at Mt Allen, and both passing loops and sidings at Hindon, Pukerangi and Middlemarch. Motive power =Steam era= Initially the line was worked by Public Works Department F class tank engines. The Railways Department used R class locomotives until 1895 when 2-8-0 T class tender engines were introduced. They were still in service in 1905. O and P class locomotives were regularly used as were 2-6-2 V class engines. The O class engines were transferred to the North Island between 1898 and 1902. The P class engines were still working the line as late as 1915. The ten UB class locomotives were all allocated to Dunedin and were the mainstay of the line from the 1900s to the 1930s and B and BA class engines were used occasionally. Q class engines worked the line in the 1940s. AB class locomotives were introduced in 1936. =Diesel era= The OCR was one of the first sections of the NZR system to be fully dieselised. The last regular steam-hauled train left Cromwell on 23 February 1968. Two steam excursion trains later conveyed photographers along parts of the line: AB 777 to Ranfurly on 27 October 1968 and AB 693 to Middlemarch on 5 April 1969. DH class diesel-electric locomotives were introduced on the line in February 1957 running as far as Clyde. They were reclassed as DG in 1968 and were withdrawn by 1983. The DH and DG engines were too heavy to run on the lighter rails of the Cromwell Gorge but the much lighter DJ class diesel locomotives (with 10.3 tonne axle loading) were allowed to run through to Cromwell. With the introduction of these locomotives on 26 February 1968 the remaining AB class steam engines were withdrawn. DI class diesels worked the line from 1978 to 1984 but being fewer in number were seen less often than the DJs, which were the mainstay of the line until its closure in 1990. =Private era= After the line to Middlemarch was taken over by Dunedin Railways (previously Taieri Gorge Railway and originally the Otago Excursion Train Trust) in 1990, their trains have primarily been operated by their fleet of six DJ locomotives. Occasionally they also run their Dunedin Silver Fern railcar (RM24) on the line, and very rarely, a steam excursion is operated, usually with an AB locomotive. Passenger services and railcars Passenger services were introduced in 1900 and replaced with mixed trains in 1917, with passenger trains only running during holiday periods. Passenger trains were reinstated in 1936. One of these trains was involved in the Hyde railway disaster of 4 June 1943, which claimed 21 lives and was at the time New Zealand's worst railway disaster (since surpassed only by the Tangiwai disaster). The passenger trains were again replaced with mixed trains in 1951, in turn replaced with Vulcan railcars in 1956. The railcar run was cut back to Alexandra in May 1958 and railcars ceased running on 25 April 1976. Closure The line remained open for some time longer than most other branch lines in the South Island, and was used to move construction materials for the Clyde Dam project. With the completion of the dam in 1990, there was little other traffic for the line and the line was closed by the New Zealand Railways Corporation on 30 April 1990. The demolition of the line from Clyde back to Middlemarch commenced on 8 December 1990 and was completed on 5 December 1991. The section from Wingatui on the outskirts of Dunedin and to Middlemarch became a tourist railway, operated by Dunedin Railways. The remainder of the line was lifted and the trackbed developed into the Otago Central Rail Trail.

Organized in 1966 and incorporated in 1971 as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation dedicated to providing opportunities for artists, developing arts education, and making the arts accessible through innovative and multicultural programs. The Council, as Humboldt County‚Äôs largest multidisciplinary arts organization, focuses on working in partnership with artists, arts organizations, community groups, and schools to strengthen the arts‚Äô accessibility and impact as aesthetic, personal and social resources. The Council envisions that the importance of art will be evident in all aspects of life in Humboldt County, including homes, schools, businesses, and government. The Council is dedicated to providing leadership in support of the rich heritage of the arts on California‚Äôs North Coast, and to bringing this legacy fully into community life. In 1987, HAC became the State Local Partner for the California Arts Council and the community representative for the California State Summer School for the Arts Program. In 1996 the Humboldt Arts Council accepted an offer from the City of Eureka to undertake the effort to save the historic 1904 Carnegie Library building, which was destined for demolition. The former Carnegie Library had been a symbol of community pride and local culture for over 100 years. After the successful Carnegie Capital Campaign to raise $1.5 million from the local community, foundations and corporations, the Council began the restoration process in 1999 to convert the historic Carnegie building into a regional art museum and art center. On January 1, 2000 the Humboldt Arts Council and the community celebrated with a ribbon cutting ceremony to dedicate the Morris Graves Museum of Art (MGMA) for its new ‚ÄúCentury of Service‚Äù to the community. Morris Graves Museum of Art The Morris Graves Museum of Art is located in Eureka, California. It was named after Morris Graves, a painter and founder of the Northwest School of Art in the Pacific Northwest. Prior to his death in 2001, he donated a substantial portion of his personal art collection, including some of his own works, and the use of his name to help with creation of the museum. It is located in the refurbished Eureka Carnegie Library building, which was the first Carnegie Library completed in California in 1904. The museum is a member of the North American Reciprocal Museums program.

These minute insects are challenging to study, as they deteriorate rapidly after death unless extreme care is taken (e.g., preservation in ethanol), making identification of most museum specimens difficult. The larvae of the majority are primary parasitoids on Hemiptera, though other hosts are attacked, and details of the life history can be variable (e.g., some attack eggs, some attack pupae, and others are hyperparasites). Males and females may have different hosts and different life histories . They are found throughout the world in virtually all habitats, and are extremely important as biological control agents. The oldest fossils are known from the Eocene aged Baltic Amber. They are difficult to separate from other Chalcidoidea except by subtle features of the wing venation and other difficult characters, and the family appears to be paraphyletic, so is likely to be split up in the future (e.g., the Azotinae and Calesinae may become separate families).

Today, Daisy is in use at major corporations for intranet knowledge bases, product and/or project documentation, and management of content-rich websites.  Content management system  The content is stored in so-called Daisy documents. These documents are managed by the Daisy Repository Server. Documents consist of parts. Parts can be anything from required blocks of text to specified fields with restricted content. By creating specific document types, different types of information can be handled differently. Simple documents just hold text and hyperlinks. By including a query in a document it is easy to create documents that aggregate other documents. Each document can have multiple variants. A variant can be a version or a translated document (language variant). Variants can be used to mark specific versions, e.g., all documents referring to version XYZ of the software described. Editing of Daisy documents is supported with a WYSIWYG Wiki-like editing environment. Site navigation trees can be made more dynamic using queries generating navigation hierarchies. Daisy is hierarchy-free and has a clear separation between repository server and front- end application. This allows for easy extension of the functionality.

In geometry, an apeirogon (from the Greek word ·ºÑœÄŒµŒπœÅŒøœÇ apeiros, \\"infinite, boundless\\" and Œ≥œâŒΩŒØŒ± gonia, \\"angle\\") or infinite polygon is a generalized polygon with a countably infinite number of sides. Apeirogons are the two-dimensional case of infinite polytopes. In some literature, the term \\"apeirogon\\" may refer only to the regular apeirogon, with an infinite dihedral group of symmetries. Definitions =Classical constructive definition= Given a point A0 in a Euclidean space and a translation S, define the point Ai to be the point obtained from i applications of the translation S to A0, so Ai = Si A0. The set of vertices Ai with i any integer, together with edges connecting adjacent vertices, is a sequence of equal segments of a line. The constructed sequence Ai is called the regular apeirogon as defined by H. S. M. Coxeter. An example of apeirogonal tiling in the hyperbolic plane, visualised using the Poincar√© disk model. A regular apeirogon can be defined as a partition of the Euclidean line E1 into infinitely many equal-length segments, generalizing the regular n-gon, which can be defined as a partition of the circle S1 into finitely many equal- length segments. =Modern abstract definition= An abstract polytope is a partially ordered set P (whose elements are called faces) with properties modeling those of the inclusions of faces of convex polytopes. The rank (or dimension) of an abstract polytope is determined by the length of the maximal ordered chains of its faces, and an abstract polytope of rank n is called an abstract n-polytope. For abstract polytopes of rank 2, this means that the elements of the partially ordered set are sets of vertices with either zero vertices (the empty set), one vertex, two vertices (an edge), or the entire vertex set, ordered by inclusion of sets, that each vertex belongs to exactly two edges, and that the undirected graph formed by the vertices and edges is connected. An abstract polytope is called an abstract apeirotope if it has infinitely many elements, and an abstract 2-apeirotope is called an abstract apeirogon. In an abstract polytope, a flag is a collection of one face of each dimension, all incident to each other (that is, comparable in the partial order) and an abstract polytope is called regular if it has symmetries (structure-preserving permutations of its elements) that take every flag to every other flag. In the case of a two-dimensional abstract polytope, this is automatically true; the symmetries of the apeirogon form the infinite dihedral group. =Pseudogon= The regular pseudogon is a partition of the hyperbolic line H1 (instead of the Euclidean line} into segments of length 2Œª, as an analogue of the regular apeirogon. Realizations of abstract apeirogons A realization of an abstract apeirogon is defined as a mapping from its vertices to a finite-dimensional geometric space (typically a Euclidean space) such that every symmetry of the abstract apeirogon corresponds to an isometry of the images of the mapping. Two realizations are called congruent if the natural bijection between their sets of vertices is induced by an isometry of their ambient Euclidean spaces. The classical definition of an apeirogon as an equally-spaced subdivision of the Euclidean line is a realization in this sense, as is the convex subset in the hyperbolic plane formed by the convex hull of equally-spaced points on a horocycle. Other realizations are possible in higher-dimensional spaces. The infinite dihedral group G of symmetries of a realization V of an abstract apeirogon P is generated by two reflections, the product of which translates each vertex of P to the next. The product of the two reflections can be decomposed as a product of a non-zero translation, finitely many rotations, and a possibly trivial reflection. Generally, the moduli space of realizations of an abstract polytope is a convex cone of infinite dimension. The realization cone of the abstract apeirogon has uncountably infinite algebraic dimension and cannot be closed in the Euclidean topology. Classification of Euclidean apeirogons The realizations of two- dimensional abstract polytopes (including both polygons and apeirogons), in Euclidean spaces of at most three dimensions can be classified into six types: *convex polygons, *star polygons, *regular apeirogons in the Euclidean line, *infinite skew polygons (infinite zig-zag polygons in the Euclidean plane), *antiprisms (including star prisms and star antiprisms), and *infinite helical polygons (evenly spaced points along a helix). Abstract apeirogons may be realized in all of these ways, in some cases mapping infinitely many different vertices of an abstract apeirogon onto finitely many points of the realization. An apeirogon also admits star polygon and antiprismatic realizations with a non-discrete set of infinitely many points. Generalizations =Higher dimension= The 3-dimensional analogues of apeirogons are apeirohedra, which are themselves the infinite analogues of polyhedra. More generally, an apeirotope, or infinite polytope, is the n-dimensional analogue of apeirogons and the infinite analogue of n-polytopes.

In 2008, the WAN optimization market was estimated to be $1 billion, and was to grow to $4.4 billion by 2014 according to Gartner, a technology research firm. In 2015 Gartner estimated the WAN optimization market to be a $1.1 billion market. The most common measures of TCP data-transfer efficiencies (i.e., optimization) are throughput, bandwidth requirements, latency, protocol optimization, and congestion, as manifested in dropped packets. In addition, the WAN itself can be classified with regards to the distance between endpoints and the amounts of data transferred. Two common business WAN topologies are Branch to Headquarters and Data Center to Data Center (DC2DC). In general, \\"Branch\\" WAN links are closer, use less bandwidth, support more simultaneous connections, support smaller connections and more short-lived connections, and handle a greater variety of protocols. They are used for business applications such as email, content management systems, database application, and Web delivery. In comparison, \\"DC2DC\\" WAN links tend to require more bandwidth, are more distant, and involve fewer connections, but those connections are bigger (100 Mbit/s to 1 Gbit/s flows) and of longer duration. Traffic on a \\"DC2DC\\" WAN may include replication, back up, data migration, virtualization, and other Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery (BC/DR) flows. WAN optimization has been the subject of extensive academic research almost since the advent of the WAN. In the early 2000s, research in both the private and public sectors turned to improving the end-to-end throughput of TCP, and the target of the first proprietary WAN optimization solutions was the Branch WAN. In recent years, however, the rapid growth of digital data, and the concomitant needs to store and protect it, has presented a need for DC2DC WAN optimization. For example, such optimizations can be performed to increase overall network capacity utilization, meet inter-datacenter transfer deadlines, or minimize average completion times of data transfers. As another example, private inter- datacenter WANs can benefit optimizations for fast and efficient geo- replication of data and content, such as newly computed machine learning models or multimedia content. Component techniques of Branch WAN Optimization include deduplication, wide area file services (WAFS), SMB proxy, HTTPS Proxy, media multicasting, web caching, and bandwidth management. Requirements for DC2DC WAN Optimization also center around deduplication and TCP acceleration, however these must occur in the context of multi-gigabit data transfer rates. WAN optimization techniques * Deduplication ‚Äì Eliminates the transfer of redundant data across the WAN by sending references instead of the actual data. By working at the byte level, benefits are achieved across IP applications. * Compression ‚Äì Relies on data patterns that can be represented more efficiently. Essentially compression techniques similar to ZIP, RAR, ARJ etc. are applied on-the-fly to data passing through hardware (or virtual machine) based WAN acceleration appliances. * Latency optimization ‚Äì Can include TCP refinements such as window-size scaling, selective acknowledgements, Layer 3 congestion control algorithms, and even co-location strategies in which the application is placed in near proximity to the endpoint to reduce latency. In some implementations, the local WAN optimizer will answer the requests of the client locally instead of forwarding the request to the remote server in order to leverage write-behind and read-ahead mechanisms to reduce WAN latency. * Caching/proxy ‚Äì Staging data in local caches; Relies on human behavior, accessing the same data over and over. * Forward error correction ‚Äì Mitigates packet loss by adding another loss- recovery packet for every ‚ÄúN‚Äù packets that are sent, and this would reduce the need for retransmissions in error-prone and congested WAN links. * Protocol spoofing ‚Äì Bundles multiple requests from chatty applications into one. May also include stream-lining protocols such as CIFS. * Traffic shaping ‚Äì Controls data flow for specific applications. Giving flexibility to network operators/network admins to decide which applications take precedence over the WAN. A common use case of traffic shaping would be to prevent one protocol or application from hogging or flooding a link over other protocols deemed more important by the business/administrator. Some WAN acceleration devices are able to traffic shape with granularity far beyond traditional network devices. Such as shaping traffic on a per user AND per application basis simultaneously. * Equalizing ‚Äì Makes assumptions on what needs immediate priority based on the data usage. Usage examples for equalizing may include wide open unregulated Internet connections and clogged VPN tunnels. * Connection limits ‚Äì Prevents access gridlock in and to denial of service or to peer. Best suited for wide open Internet access links, can also be used links. * Simple rate limits ‚Äì Prevents one user from getting more than a fixed amount of data. Best suited as a stop gap first effort for remediating a congested Internet connection or WAN link.

History  It is commonly reported that the Pfaltzgraff company was founded in 1811 in York County, Pennsylvania, by several members of the Pfaltzgraff family who were potters, though the most notable member was Johann George Pfaltzgraff, who arrived in York County from Germany in 1833. Johann, having come from a family of potters, knew the trade, and passed his skills on to his seven sons. After Johann died in 1873, three of his children, John, George, and Henry, were still carrying on the business. The business became official in 1889 when George and Henry started a partnership that would become The Pfaltzgraff Co. The first factory was built in 1895. The business continued to grow, and in 1960, Pfaltzgraff opened their first retail store under the name Pottery Hill. During the 1950s and 1960s, the products were mostly sold in specialty stores, but in the 1970s, the business made a strategic decision to sell in higher-end department stores, such as G Fox and Macy's.

Demand Characteristics and the concept of Quasi-Controls. in Artifacts in Behavioral Research: Robert Rosenthal and Ralph L. Rosnow's Classic Books, beginning with page 110 Typically, demand characteristics are considered an extraneous variable, exerting an effect on behavior other than that intended by the experimenter. Pioneering research was conducted on demand characteristics by Martin Orne.Dinges, David. In Memory of Dr. Orne A possible cause for demand characteristics is participants' expectations that they will somehow be evaluated, leading them to figure out a way to 'beat' the experiment to attain good scores in the alleged evaluation. Demand characteristics cannot be eliminated from experiments, but demand characteristics can be studied to see their effect on such experiments. Examples of common demand characteristics Common demand characteristics include: * Rumors of the study ‚Äì any information, true or false, circulated about the experiment outside of the experiment itself. * Setting of the laboratory ‚Äì the location where the experiment is being performed, if it is significant. * Explicit or Implicit communication ‚Äì any communication between the participant and experimenter, whether it be verbal or non-verbal, that may influence their perception of the experiment. Weber and Cook have described some demand characteristics as involving the participant taking on a role in the experiment. These roles include: *The good-participant role in which the participant attempts to discern the experimenter's hypotheses and to confirm them.Nichols, A. L., & Maner, J. K. (2008). The good subject effect: Investigating participant demand characteristics. Journal of General Psychology, 135, 151-165. The participant does not want to \\"ruin\\" the experiment. *The negative-participant role (also known as the screw-you effectMasling, J. (1966) Role-related behavior of the subject and psychologist and its effect upon psychological data. In D. Levine (Ed.), The Nebraska symposium on motivation. Lincoln, NB: University of Nebraska Press. Pp. 67-103.) in which the participant attempts to discern the experimenter's hypotheses, but only in order to destroy the credibility of the study. *The faithful-participant role in which the participant follows the instructions given by the experimenter to the letter. *The apprehensive-participant role in which the participant is so concerned about how the experimenter might evaluate the responses that the participant behaves in a socially desirable way.Barabasz, A. F., & Barabasz, M. (1992). Research designs and considerations. In E. Frornm & M. R. Nash (Eds.), Contemporary hypnosis research (pp. 173-200). New York: Guilford.

The Effects of Hypnotic Ego Strengthening on Self-esteem (masters degree thesis) (p. 43).  Dealing with demand characteristics  Researchers use a number of different approaches for reducing the effect of demand characteristics in research situations. Some of the more common approaches include the following: * Deception: Deceive participants about one or more aspects of the research to conceal the research hypothesis. * Post-experimental questionnaires: For example, Rubin (2016) discusses the Perceived Awareness of the Research Hypothesis (PARH) scale.Rubin, M. (2016). The Perceived Awareness of the Research Hypothesis Scale: Assessing the influence of demand characteristics. Figshare. doi: 10.6084/m9.figshare.4315778 This 4-item scale is usually presented at the end of a research session. In responding to the scale, participants indicate the extent to which they believe that they are aware of the researchers' hypotheses during the research. Researchers then compute a mean PARH score and correlate this with their key effects. Significant correlations indicate that demand characteristics may be related to the research results. Nonsignificant correlations provide tentative evidence against the demand characteristics explanation. Pre-experimental questionnaires can also cause demand characteristics as well as post- experimental questionnaires. A different experimenter than the one that conducted the actual experiment to the participants should distribute the questionnaires.Orne, Martin T. (1962). \\"On the social psychology of the psychological experiment: With particular reference to demand characteristics and their implications.\\". American Psychologist 17 (11): 776‚Äì783. doi:10.1037/h0043424 * Unobtrusive manipulations and measures: Conceal independent and dependent measures, so they do not provide clues about the research hypothesis. * Have self-discipline: The experimenter must display self-discipline to obtain a valid inquiry. * Avoid temptation: If the experiment is performed again, avoid asking the participants what they have experienced. * The more the merrier: To avoid experimenter bias, have more than one experimenter. * Be specific and clear: If the purpose of the experiment is not clear or ambiguous, then the participants may guess many different hypotheses and cause the data to be skewed even more. * Double blind: Do not inform the person who has contact with the participants about the research hypotheses. This reduces the experimenter-expectancy effect. * Minimize interpersonal contact between the researcher and the participant: Reduces experimenter expectancy effect. * Use a between-subjects design rather than a within-subjects design: (e.g., Rubin & Badea, 2010, p. 411).Rubin, M., & Badea, C. (2010). The central tendency of a social group can affect ratings of its intragroup variability in the absence of social identity concerns.

According to the anarchist historian Max Nettlau, the first use of the term libertarian communism was in November 1880, when a French anarchist congress employed it to more clearly identify its doctrines. The French anarchist journalist S√©bastien Faure, later founder and editor of the four- volume Anarchist Encyclopedia, started the weekly paper Le Libertaire (The Libertarian) in 1895. D√©jacque \\"rejected Blanquism, which was based on a division between the ‚Äòdisciples of the great people‚Äôs Architect‚Äô and ‚Äòthe people, or vulgar herd,‚Äô and was equally opposed to all the variants of social republicanism, to the dictatorship of one man and to ‚Äòthe dictatorship of the little prodigies of the proletariat.‚Äô With regard to the last of these, he wrote that: ‚Äòa dictatorial committee composed of workers is certainly the most conceited and incompetent, and hence the most anti-revolutionary, thing that can be found...(It is better to have doubtful enemies in power than dubious friends)‚Äô. He saw ‚Äòanarchic initiative,‚Äô ‚Äòreasoned will‚Äô and ‚Äòthe autonomy of each‚Äô as the conditions for the social revolution of the proletariat, the first expression of which had been the barricades of June 1848. In D√©jacque's view, a government resulting from an insurrection remains a reactionary fetter on the free initiative of the proletariat. Or rather, such free initiative can only arise and develop by the masses ridding themselves of the ‚Äòauthoritarian prejudices‚Äô by means of which the state reproduces itself in its primary function of representation and delegation. D√©jacque wrote that: ‚ÄòBy government I understand all delegation, all power outside the people,‚Äô for which must be substituted, in a process whereby politics is transcended, the ‚Äòpeople in direct possession of their sovereignty,‚Äô or the ‚Äòorganised commune.‚Äô For D√©jacque, the communist anarchist utopia would fulfil the function of inciting each proletarian to explore his or her own human potentialities, in addition to correcting the ignorance of the proletarians concerning ‚Äòsocial science.‚Äô\\"Alain Pengam. \\"Anarchist-Communism\\" Le Libertaire, Journal du mouvement social.

Hosted by Melvyn Bragg of the BBC, with John Keane, Professor of Politics at University of Westminster, Ruth Kinna, Senior Lecturer in Politics at Loughborough University, and Peter Marshall, philosopher and historian. Proudhon opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests, and the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of coercion that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and keeps wealth in the hands of the few. Proudhon favoured a right of individuals to retain the product of their labor as their own property, but believed that any property beyond that which an individual produced and could possess was illegitimate. Thus, he saw private property as both essential to liberty and a road to tyranny, the former when it resulted from labor and was required for labor and the latter when it resulted in exploitation (profit, interest, rent, tax). He generally called the former \\"possession\\" and the latter \\"property.\\" For large-scale industry, he supported workers associations to replace wage labour and opposed the ownership of land. Proudhon maintained that those who labor should retain the entirety of what they produce, and that monopolies on credit and land are the forces that prohibit such. He advocated an economic system that included private property as possession and exchange market but without profit, which he called mutualism. It is Proudhon's philosophy that was explicitly rejected by Joseph Dejacque in the inception of anarchist- communism, with the latter asserting directly to Proudhon in a letter that \\"it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.\\" Joseph Dejacque was a major critic of Proudhon. Dejacque thought that \\"the Proudhonist version of Ricardian socialism, centred on the reward of labour power and the problem of exchange value. In his polemic with Proudhon on women‚Äôs emancipation, D√©jacque urged Proudhon to push on ‚Äòas far as the abolition of the contract, the abolition not only of the sword and of capital, but of property and authority in all their forms,‚Äô and refuted the commercial and wages logic of the demand for a ‚Äòfair reward‚Äô for ‚Äòlabour‚Äô (labour power). D√©jacque asked: ‚ÄòAm I thus... right to want, as with the system of contracts, to measure out to each ‚Äî according to their accidental capacity to produce ‚Äî what they are entitled to?‚Äô The answer given by D√©jacque to this question is unambiguous: ‚Äòit is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.‚Äô\\"...For D√©jacque, on the other hand, the communal state of affairs ‚Äî the phalanstery ‚Äòwithout any hierarchy, without any authority‚Äô except that of the ‚Äòstatistics book‚Äô ‚Äî corresponded to ‚Äònatural exchange,‚Äô i.e. to the ‚Äòunlimited freedom of all production and consumption; the abolition of any sign of agricultural, individual, artistic or scientific property; the destruction of any individual holding of the products of work; the demonarchisation and the demonetarisation of manual and intellectual capital as well as capital in instruments, commerce and buildings. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, the first self-identified anarchist. After the creation of the First International, or International Workingmen's Association (IWA) in London in 1864, Mikhail Bakunin made his first tentative of creation an anti- authoritarian revolutionary organization, the \\"International Revolutionary Brotherhood\\" (\\"Fraternit√© internationale r√©volutionnaire\\") or the Alliance (\\"l'Alliance\\"). He renewed this in 1868, creating the \\"International Brothers\\" (\\"Fr√®res internationaux\\") or \\"Alliance for Democratic Socialism\\". Bakunin and other federalists were excluded by Karl Marx from the IWA at the Hague Congress of 1872, and formed the Jura federation, which met the next year at the 1872 Saint-Imier Congress, where was created the Anarchist St. Imier International (1872‚Äì1877).  Anarchist participation in the Paris Commune  In 1870 Mikhail Bakunin led a failed uprising in Lyon on the principles later exemplified by the Paris Commune, calling for a general uprising in response to the collapse of the French government during the Franco-Prussian War, seeking to transform an imperialist conflict into social revolution. In his Letters to A Frenchman on the Present Crisis, he argued for a revolutionary alliance between the working class and the peasantry and set forth his formulation of what was later to become known as propaganda of the deed. Anarchist historian George Woodcock reports that \\"The annual Congress of the International had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune, and in 1871 the General Council called only a special conference in London. One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy, while a technical excuse - that they had split away from the F√©d√©ration Romande - was used to avoid inviting Bakunin's Swiss supporters. Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present, and the General Council's resolutions passed almost unanimously. Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin and his followers.\\"George Woodcock, Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements (1962). In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the Hague Congress, where Bakunin and James Guillaume were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York. In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the St. Imier Congress, adopting a revolutionary anarchist program.Robert Graham 'Anarchism (Montreal: Black Rose Books, 2005) . Louise Michel anarchist communard The Paris Commune was a government that briefly ruled Paris from March 18 (more formally, from March 28) to May 28, 1871. The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War. Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune. They included Louise Michel, the Reclus brothers, and Eugene Varlin (the latter murdered in the repression afterwards). As for the reforms initiated by the Commune, such as the re-opening of workplaces as co- operatives, anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised...Moreover, the Commune's ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of Proudhon on French radical ideas. Indeed, the Commune's vision of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes Bakunin's and Proudhon's ideas (Proudhon, like Bakunin, had argued in favour of the \\"implementation of the binding mandate\\" in 1848...and for federation of communes). Thus both economically and politically the Paris Commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas.\\"The Paris Commune\\" by Anarcho \\". George Woodcock manifests that \\"a notable contribution to the activities of the Commune and particularly to the organization of public services was made by members of various anarchist factions, including the mutualists Courbet, Longuet, and Vermorel, the libertarian collectivists Varlin, Malon, and Lefrangais, and the bakuninists Elie and Elis√©e Reclus and Louise Michel.\\" Louise Michel was an important anarchist participant in the Paris Commune. Initially she workerd as an ambulance woman, treating those injured on the barricades. During the Siege of Paris she untiringly preached resistance to the Prussians. On the establishment of the Commune, she joined the National Guard. She offered to shoot Thiers, and suggested the destruction of Paris by way of vengeance for its surrender. In December 1871, she was brought before the 6th council of war, charged with offences including trying to overthrow the government, encouraging citizens to arm themselves, and herself using weapons and wearing a military uniform. Defiantly, she vowed to never renounce the Commune, and dared the judges to sentence her to death.Louise Michel, a French anarchist women who fought in the Paris commune Reportedly, Michel told the court, \\"Since it seems that every heart that beats for freedom has no right to anything but a little slug of lead, I demand my share. If you let me live, I shall never cease to cry for vengeance.\\" Following the 1871 Paris Commune, the anarchist movement, as the whole of the workers' movement, was decapitated and deeply affected for years.  The propaganda of the deed period and exile to Britain  Parts of the anarchist movement, based in Switzerland, started theorizing propaganda of the deed. From the late 1880s to 1895, a series of attacks by self-declared anarchists brought anarchism into the public eye and generated a wave of anxieties. The most infamous of these deeds were the bombs of Ravachol, Emile Henry, and Auguste Vaillant, and the assassination of the President of the Republic Sadi Carnot by Caserio. After Auguste Vaillant's bomb in the Chamber of Deputies, the \\"Opportunist Republicans\\" voted in 1893 the first anti-terrorist laws, which were quickly denounced as lois sc√©l√©rates (\\"villainous laws\\"). These laws severely restricted freedom of expression. The first one condemned apology of any felony or crime as a felony itself, permitting widespread censorship of the press. The second one allowed to condemn any person directly or indirectly involved in a propaganda of the deed act, even if no killing was effectively carried on. The last one condemned any person or newspaper using anarchist propaganda (and, by extension, socialist libertarians present or former members of the International Workingmen's Association (IWA)): > \\"1. Either by provocation or by apology... [anyone who has] encouraged one > or several persons in committing either a stealing, or the crimes of murder, > looting or arson...; 2. Or has addressed a provocation to military from the > Army or the Navy, in the aim of diverting them from their military duties > and the obedience due to their chiefs... will be deferred before courts and > punished by a prison sentence of three months to two years. \\"1. Soit par > provocation, soit par apologie [...] incit√© une ou plusieurs personnes √† > commettre soit un vol, soit les crimes de meurtre, de pillage, d'incendie > [...] ; 2. Ou adress√© une provocation √† des militaires des arm√©es de terre > et de mer, dans le but de les d√©tourner de leurs devoirs militaires et de > l'ob√©issance qu‚Äôils doivent √† leurs chefs [...] serait d√©f√©r√© aux tribunaux > de police correctionnelle et puni d'un emprisonnement de trois mois √† deux > ans.\\" Thus, free speech and encouraging propaganda of the deed or antimilitarism was severely restricted. Some people were condemned to prison for rejoicing themselves of the 1894 assassination of French president Sadi Carnot by the Italian anarchist Caserio. The term of lois sc√©l√©rates (\\"villainous laws\\") has since entered popular language to design any harsh or injust laws, in particular anti-terrorism legislation which often broadly represses the whole of the social movements. √âmile Pouget The United Kingdom quickly became the last haven for political refugees, in particular anarchists, who were all conflated with the few who had engaged in bombings. Already, the First International had been founded in London in 1871, where Karl Marx had taken refuge nearly twenty years before. But in the 1890s, the UK became a nest for anarchist colonies expelled from the continent, in particular between 1892 and 1895, which marked the height of the repression, with the \\"Trial of the thirty\\" taking place in 1884. Louise Michel, a.k.a. \\"the Red Virgin\\", √âmile Pouget or Charles Malato were the most famous of the many, anonymous anarchists, deserters or simple criminals who had fled France and other European countries. Many of them returned to France after President F√©lix Faure's amnesty in February 1895. A few hundreds persons related to the anarchist movement would however remain in the UK between 1880 and 1914. The right of asylum was a British tradition since the Reformation in the 16th century. However, it would progressively be eroded, and the French immigrants were met with hostility. Several hate campaigns would be issued in the British press in the 1890s against these French exilees, relayed by riots and a \\"restrictionist\\" party which advocated the end of liberality concerning freedom of movement, and hostility towards French and international activists.Project of a doctoral thesis , continuing work on \\"French Anarchists in England, 1880-1905\\", including a large French & English bibliography, with archives and contemporary newspapers.  1895-1914  Le Libertaire, a newspaper created by S√©bastien Faure, one of the leading supporters of Alfred Dreyfus, and Louise Michel, alias \\"The Red Virgin\\", published its first issue on November 16, 1895. The Conf√©d√©ration g√©n√©rale du travail (CGT) trade-union was created in the same year, from the fusion of the various \\"Bourses du travail\\" (Fernand Pelloutier), the unions and the industries' federations. Dominated by anarcho-syndicalists, the CGT adopted the Charte d'Amiens in 1906, a year after the unification of the other socialist tendencies in the SFIO party (French Section of the Second International) led by Jean Jaur√®s and Jules Guesde. Only eight French delegates attended the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam in August 1907. According to historian Jean Maitron, the anarchist movement in France was divided into those who rejected the sole idea of organisation, and were therefore opposed to the very idea of an international organisation, and those who put all their hopes in syndicalism, and thus \\"were occupied elsewhere\\".Jean Maitron, Le mouvement anarchiste en France, tome I, Tel Gallimard (Fran√ßois Maspero, 1975), pp.443-445 Only eight French anarchists assisted the Congress, among whom Beno√Æt Broutchoux, Pierre Monatte and Ren√© de Marmande. A few tentatives of organisation followed the Congress, but all were short-lived. In the industrial North, anarchists from Lille, Armenti√®res, Denains, Lens, Roubaix and Tourcoing decided to call for a Congress in December 1907, and agreed upon the creation of a newspaper, Le Combat, which editorial board was to act as the informal bureau of an officially non-existent federation. Another federation was created in the Seine and the Seine-et-Oise in June 1908.Jean Maitron, 1975, tome I, p.446 S√©bastien Faure However, at the approach of the 1910 legislative election, an Anti-Parliamentary Committee was set up and, instead of dissolving itself afterwards, became permanent under the name of Alliance communiste anarchiste (Communist Anarchist Alliance). The new organisation excluded any permanent members.Jean Maitron, 1975, tome I, p.448 Although this new group also faced opposition from certain anarchists (including Jean Grave), it was quickly replaced by a new organization, the F√©d√©ration communiste (Communist Federation). The Communist Federation was founded in June 1911 with 400 members, all from the Parisian region. It quickly took the name of F√©d√©ration anarcho-communiste (Anarcho-Communist Federation), choosing Louis Lecoin as secretary. The F√©d√©ration communiste r√©volutionnaire anarchiste, headed by S√©bastien Faure, succeeded to the FCA in August 1913. The French anarchist milieu also included many individualists. They centered around publications such as L‚ÄôAnarchie and EnDehors. The main French individualist anarchist theorists were √âmile Armand and Han Ryner who also were influential in the Iberian peninsula. Other important individualist activists included Albert Libertad, Andr√© Lorulot, Victor Serge, Zo d'Axa and Rirette Maitrejean. Influenced by Max Stirner's egoism and the criminal/political exploits of Cl√©ment Duval and Marius Jacob, France became the birthplace of illegalism, a controversial anarchist ideology that openly embraced criminality. Relations between individualist and communist anarchists remained poor throughout the pre-war years. Following the 1913 trial of the infamous Bonnot Gang, the FCA condemned individualism as bourgeois and more in keeping with capitalism than communism. An article believed to have been written by Peter Kropotkin, in the British anarchist paper Freedom, argued that \\"Simple-minded young comrades were often led away by the illegalists' apparent anarchist logic; outsiders simply felt disgusted with anarchist ideas and definitely stopped their ears to any propaganda.\\" After the assassination of anti-militarist socialist leader Jean Jaur√®s a few days before the beginning of World War I, and the subsequent rallying of the Second International and the workers' movement to the war, even some anarchists supported the Sacred Union (Union Sacr√©e) government. Jean Grave, Peter Kropotkin and others published the Manifesto of the Sixteen supporting the Triple Entente against Germany. A clandestine issue of the Libertaire was published on June 15, 1917. = French individualist anarchism = Han Ryner From the legacy of Proudhon and Stirner there emerged a strong tradition of French individualist anarchism. An early important individualist anarchist was Anselme Bellegarrigue. He participated in the French Revolution of 1848, was author and editor of 'Anarchie, Journal de l'Ordre and Au fait ! Au fait ! Interpr√©tation de l'id√©e d√©mocratique' and wrote the important early Anarchist Manifesto in 1850. Catalan historian of individualist anarchism Xavier Diez reports that during his travels in the United States \\"he at least contacted (Henry David) Thoreau and, probably (Josiah) Warren.\\"Xavier Diez. El anarquismo individualista en Espa√±a (1923‚Äì1938). Virus editorial. Barcelona. 2007. pg. 60Autonomie Individuelle was an individualist anarchist publication that ran from 1887 to 1888. It was edited by Jean-Baptiste Louiche, Charles Sch√¶ffer and Georges Deherme.http://www.la-presse-anarchiste.net/spip.php?rubrique258 Autonomie Individuelle (1887‚Äì1888) Later, this tradition continued with such intellectuals as Albert Libertad, Andr√© Lorulot, √âmile Armand, Victor Serge, Zo d'Axa and Rirette Maitrejean, who developed theory in the main individualist anarchist journal in France, L'Anarchie\\"On the fringe of the movement, and particularly in the individualist faction which became relatively strong after 1900 and began to publish its own sectarian paper, ‚àí315- L'Anarchie ( 1905‚Äì14), there were groups and individuals who lived largely by crime. Among them were some of the most original as well as some of the most tragic figures in anarchist history.\\" Woodcock, George. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements. 1962 in 1905. Outside this journal, Han Ryner wrote Petit Manuel individualiste (1903). Later appeared the journal L'EnDehors created by Zo d'Axa in 1891. Zo d'Axa French individualist circles had a strong sense of personal libertarianism and experimentation. Naturism and free love contents started to have an influence in individualist anarchist circles and from there it expanded to the rest of anarchism also appearing in Spanish individualist anarchist groups. \\"Along with feverish activity against the social order, (Albert) Libertad was usually also organizing feasts, dances and country excursions, in consequence of his vision of anarchism as the ‚Äújoy of living‚Äù and not as militant sacrifice and death instinct, seeking to reconcile the requirements of the individual (in his need for autonomy) with the need to destroy authoritarian society.\\" Anarchist naturism was promoted by Henri Zisly, Emile Gravelle The daily bleed and Georges Butaud. Butaud was an individualist \\"partisan of the milieux libres, publisher of \\"Flambeau\\" (\\"an enemy of authority\\") in 1901 in Vienna. Most of his energies were devoted to creating anarchist colonies (communaut√©s exp√©rimentales) in which he participated in several.http://www.eskimo.com/~recall/bleed/0226.htm \\"1926 ‚Äì France: Georges Butaud (1868‚Äì1926) dies, in Ermont.\\" \\"In this sense, the theoretical positions and the vital experiences of french individualism are deeply iconoclastic and scandalous, even within libertarian circles. The call of nudist naturism, the strong defence of birth control methods, the idea of \\"unions of egoists\\" with the sole justification of sexual practices, that will try to put in practice, not without difficulties, will establish a way of thought and action, and will result in sympathy within some, and a strong rejection within others.\\"\\"La insumisi√≥n voluntaria.

Individualist anarchist activity spanned the full spectrum of alternatives to authoritarian society, subverting it by undermining its way of life facet by facet.\\"Thus theft, counterfeiting, swindling and robbery became a way of life for hundreds of individualists, as it was already for countless thousands of proletarians. The wave of anarchist bombings and assassinations of the 1890s (Auguste Vaillant, Ravachol, Emile Henry, Sante Caserio) and the practice of illegalism from the mid-1880s to the start of the First World War (Cl√©ment Duval, Pini, Marius Jacob, the Bonnot gang) were twin aspects of the same proletarian offensive, but were expressed in an individualist practice, one that complemented the great collective struggles against capital.\\" Illegalists usually did not seek moral basis for their actions, recognizing only the reality of \\"might\\" rather than \\"right\\"; for the most part, illegal acts were done simply to satisfy personal desires, not for some greater ideal,Parry, Richard.

Influenced by theorist Max Stirner's egoism as well as Proudhon (his view that Property is theft!), Cl√©ment Duval and Marius Jacob proposed the theory of la reprise individuelle (Eng: individual reclamation) which justified robbery on the rich and personal direct action against exploiters and the system., Illegalism first rose to prominence among a generation of Europeans inspired by the unrest of the 1890s, during which Ravachol, √âmile Henry, Auguste Vaillant, and Caserio committed daring crimes in the name of anarchism,\\"Pre-World War I France was the setting for the only documented anarchist revolutionary movement to embrace all illegal activity as revolutionary practice. Pick-pocketing, theft from the workplace, robbery, confidence scams, desertion from the armed forces, you name it, illegalist activity was praised as a justifiable and necessary aspect of class struggle.\\"\\"Illegalism\\" by Rob los Ricos in what is known as propaganda of the deed. France's Bonnot Gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.  From World War I to World War II  After the war, the CGT became more reformist, and anarchists progressively drifted out. Formerly dominated by the anarcho-syndicalists, the CGT split into a non- communist section and a communist Conf√©d√©ration g√©n√©rale du travail unitaire (CGTU) after the 1920 Tours Congress which marked the creation of the French Communist Party (PCF). A new weekly series of the Libertaire was edited, and the anarchists announced the imminent creation of an Anarchist Federation. A Union Anarchiste (UA) group was constituted in November 1919 against the Bolsheviks, and the first daily issue of the Libertaire got out on December 4, 1923. Russian exiles, among them Nestor Makhno and Piotr Arshinov, founded in Paris the review Dielo Trouda (–î–µ–ª–æ –¢—Ä—É–¥–∞, The Cause of Labour) in 1925. Makhno co-wrote and co-published The Organizational Platform of the Libertarian Communists, which put forward ideas on how anarchists should organize based on the experiences of revolutionary Ukraine and the defeat at the hand of the Bolsheviks. The document was initially rejected by most anarchists, but today has a wide following. It remains controversial to this day, some (including, at the time of publication, Voline and Malatesta) viewing its implications as too rigid and hierarchical. Platformism, as Makhno's position came to be known, advocated ideological unity, tactical unity, collective action and discipline, and federalism. Five hundred people attended Makhno's 1934 funeral at the P√®re-Lachaise. In June 1926, \\"The Organisational Platform Project for a General Union of Anarchists\\", best known under the name \\"Archinov's Platform\\", was launched. Voline responded by publishing a Synthesis project in his article \\"Le probl√®me organisationnel et l'id√©e de synth√®se\\" (\\"The Organisational Problem and the Idea of a Synthesis\\"). After the Orl√©ans Congress (July 12‚Äì14, 1926), the Anarchist Union (UA) transformed itself into the Communist Anarchist Union (UAC, Union anarchiste communiste). The gap widened between proponents of Platformism and those who followed Voline's synthesis anarchism. The Congress of the F√©d√©ration autonome du B√¢timent (November 13‚Äì14, 1926) in Lyon, created the CGT-SR (Conf√©d√©ration G√©n√©rale du Travail-Syndicaliste R√©volutionnaire) with help from members of the Spanish Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT), which prompted the CGT's revolutionary syndicalists to join it. Julien Toublet became the new trade-union's secretary. Le Libertaire became again a weekly newspaper in 1926. At the Orl√©ans Congress of October 31 and November 1, 1927, the UAC became Platformist. The minority of those who followed Voline split and create the Association des f√©d√©ralistes anarchistes (AFA) which diffused the Trait d'union libertaire then La Voix Libertaire. Some Synthesists later rejoined the UAC (in 1930), which took the initiative of a Congress in 1934 to unite the anarchist movement on the basis of anti-fascism. The Congress took place on 20 and 21 May 1934, following the February 6, 1934, far right riots in Paris. All of the left-wing feared a fascist coup d'√©tat, and the anarchists were at the spearhead of the anti-fascist movement. The AFA dissolved itself the same year, and joined the new group, promptly renamed Union anarchiste. However, a F√©d√©ration communiste libertaire later created itself after a new split in the UA. Anarchists then participated in the general strikes during the Popular Front (1936‚Äì38) which led to the Matignon Accords (40 hours week, etc.) Headed by L√©on Blum, the Popular Front did not intervene in the Spanish civil war, because of the Radicals' presence in the government. Thus, Blum blocked the Brigades from crossing the borders and sent ambulances to the Spanish Republicans, while Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini were sending men and weapons to Francisco Franco. In the same way, Blum refused to boycott the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, and to support the People's Olympiad in Barcelona. Some anarchists became members of International Antifascist Solidarity (Solidarit√© internationale antifasciste), which helped volunteers illegally cross the border, while others went to Spain and joined the Durruti Column's French-speaking contingent, The S√©bastien Faure Century. A F√©d√©ration anarchiste de langue fran√ßaise (FAF) developed from a split in the UA, and denounce the collusion between the French anarchists with the Popular Front, as well as criticizing the CNT-FAI's participation to the Republican government in Spain. The FAF edited Terre libre, in which Voline collaborated. Before World War II, there are two organizations, the Union anarchiste (UA), which had as its newspaper Le Libertaire, and the F√©d√©ration anarchiste fran√ßaise (FAF) which had the Terre libre newspaper. However, to the contrary of the French Communist Party (PCF) which had organized a clandestine network before the war ‚Äì √âdouard Daladier's government even had made it illegal after the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact ‚Äì the anarchist groups lacked any clandestine infrastructure in 1940. Hence, as all other parties apart of the PCF, they quickly became completely disorganized during and after the Battle of France.  Under Vichy  After Operation Barbarossa and the Allies' landing in North Africa, Marshal Philippe P√©tain, head of the new \\"French State\\" (Vichy regime) which had replaced the French Third Republic, saw \\"the bad wind approaching.\\" (\\"le mauvais vent s'approcher\\"). The Resistance began to start organizing itself in 1942-1943\\\\. Meanwhile, the French police, under the orders of Ren√© Bousquet and his second in command, Jean Leguay, systematically added to the list of targets designed by the Gestapo (communists, freemasons, Jews, and anarchists.)Maurice Rajsfus, La police de Vichy, Les forces de l'ordre fran√ßaises au service de la Gestapo 1940-1944, Le Cherche Midi, 1995 On 19 July 1943, a clandestine meeting of anarchist activists took place in Toulouse; they spoke of the F√©d√©ration internationale syndicaliste r√©volutionnaire. On January 15, 1944, the new F√©d√©ration Anarchiste decided on a charter approved in Agen on October 29‚Äì30, 1944. Decision was taken to publish clandestinely Le Libertaire as to maintain relations; its first issue was published in December 1944. After the Liberation, the newspaper again became a bi-weekly, and on October 6‚Äì7, 1945, the Assises du mouvement libertaire were held.  The Fourth Republic (1945-1958)  The F√©d√©ration Anarchiste (FA) was founded in Paris on December 2, 1945, and elected George Fontenis as its first secretary the next year. It was composed of a majority of activists from the former FA (which supported Voline's Synthesis) and some members of the former Union anarchiste, which supported the CNT-FAI support to the Republican government during the Spanish Civil War, as well as some young Resistants. A youth organization of the FA (the Jeunesses libertaires) was also created. Apart of some individualist anarchists grouped behind √âmile Armand, who published L'Unique and L'EnDehors, and some pacifists (Louvet and Maille who published A contre-courant), the French anarchists were thus united in the FA. Furthermore, a confederate structure was created to coordinate publications with Louvet and Ce qu‚Äôil faut dire newspaper, the anarcho-syndicalist minority of the reunited CGT (gathered into the F√©d√©ration syndicaliste fran√ßaise (FSF), they represented the 'Action syndicaliste' current inside the CGT), and Le Libertaire newspaper. The FSF finally transformed itself into the actual Conf√©d√©ration nationale du travail (CNT) on December 6, 1946, adopting the Paris charter and publishing Le Combat Syndicaliste. The Conf√©d√©ration nationale du travail (CNT, or National Confederation of Labour) was founded in 1946 by Spanish anarcho-syndicalists in exile with former members of the CGT-SR. The CNT later split into the CNT- Vignoles and the CNT-AIT, which is the French section of the IWA. The anarchists started the 1947 insurrectionary strikes at the Renault factories, crushed by Interior Minister socialist Jules Moch, whom created for the occasion the Compagnies R√©publicaines de S√©curit√© (CRS) riot-police. Because of the CNT's inner divisions, some FA activists decided to participate to the creation of the reformist CGT-FO, issued from a split within the communist dominated CGT. The FA participated to the International Anarchist Congress of Puteaux in 1949, which gathered structured organizations as well as autonomous groups and individuals (from Germany, USA, Bolivia, Cuba, Argentina, Peru and elsewhere). Some communist anarchists organized themselves early in 1950 in a fraction, named Organisation pens√©e bataille (OPB) which had as aim to impose a single political stance and centralize the organization. The GAAP (Groupes anarchistes d'action prol√©tarienne) were created on February 24‚Äì25, 1951, in Italy by former members of the FAI excluded at the congress of Anc√¥ne. The same year, the FA decides, on a proposition from the Louise Michel group animated by Maurice Joyeux, to substitute individual vote to the group vote. The adopted positions gain federalist status, but are not imposed to individuals. Individualists opposed to this motion failed to block it. \\"Haute fr√©quence\\", a surrealist manifest was published in Le Libertaire on July 6, 1951. Some surrealists started working with the FA. Furthermore, the Mouvement ind√©pendant des auberges de jeunesse (MIAJ, Independent Movement of Youth Hostels) was created at the end of 1951. In 1950 a clandestine group formed within the FA called Organisation Pens√©e Bataille (OPB) led by George Fontenis.C√©dric Guerin. \\"Pens√©e et action des anarchistes en France : 1950-1970\\" The OPB pushed for a move which saw the FA change its name into the F√©d√©ration communiste libertaire (FCL) after the 1953 Congress in Paris, while an article in Le Libertaire indicated the end of the cooperation with the French Surrealist Group led by Andr√© Breton. The FCL regrouped between 130 and 160 activists. The new decision making process was founded on unanimity: each person has a right of veto on the orientations of the federation. The FCL published the same year the Manifeste du communisme libertaire. The FCL published its 'workers‚Äô program' in 1954, which was heavily inspired by the CGT's revendications. The Internationale comuniste libertaire (ICL), which groups the Italian GAAP, the Spanish Ruta and the Mouvement libertaire nord- africain (MLNA, North African Libertarian Movement), was founded to replace the Anarchist International, deemed too reformist. The first issue of the monthly Monde libertaire, the news organ of the FA which would be published until 1977, came out in October 1954. Several groups quit the FCL in December 1955, disagreeing with the decision to present \\"revolutionary candidates\\" to the legislative elections. On August 15‚Äì20, 1954, the Ve intercontinental plenum of the CNT took place. A group called Entente anarchiste appeared which was formed of militants who didn't like the new ideological orientation that the OPB was giving the FCL seeing it was authoritarian and almost marxist.\\"Si la critique de la d√©viation autoritaire de la FA est le principal fait de ralliement, on peut ressentir d√®s le premier num√©ro un √©tat d'esprit qui va longtemps coller √† la peau des anarchistes fran√ßais. Cet √©tat d'esprit se caract√©rise ainsi sous une double forme : d'une part un rejet inconditionnel de l'ennemi marxiste, d'autre part des questions sur le r√¥le des anciens et de l'√©volution id√©ologique de l'anarchisme. C'est Fernand Robert qui attaque le premier : \\"Le LIB est devenu un journal marxiste. En continuant √† le soutenir, tout en reconnaissant qu‚Äôil ne nous pla√Æt pas, vous fa√Ætes une mauvaise action contre votre id√©al anarchiste. Vous donnez la main √† vos ennemis dans la pens√©e. M√™me si la FA dispara√Æt, m√™me si le LIB dispara√Æt, l'anarchie y gagnera. Le marxisme ne repr√©sente plus rien. Il faut le mettre bas ; je pense la m√™me chose des dirigeants actuels de la FA. L'ennemi se glisse partout.\\" C√©dric Gu√©rin. \\"Pens√©e et action des anarchistes en France : 1950-1970\\" The FCL lasted until 1956 just after it participated in state legislative elections with 10 candidates. This move alienated some members of the FCL and thus produced the end of the organization. A group of militants who didn't agree with the FA turning into FCL reorganized a new Federation Anarchiste which was established in December 1953. This included those who formed L'Entente anarchiste who joined the new FA and then dissolved L'Entente. The new base principles of the FA were written by the individualist anarchist Charles-Auguste Bontemps and the non-platformist anarcho-communist Maurice Joyeux which established an organization with a plurality of tendencies and autonomy of group organized around synthesist principles. According to historian C√©dric Gu√©rin, \\"the unconditional rejection of Marxism became from that moment onwards an identity element of the new Federation Anarchiste\\" and this was motivated in a big part after the previous conflict with George Fontenis and his OPB. Also it was decided to establish within the organization a Committee of Relations composed of a General Secretary, a Secretary of Internal Relations, a Secretary of External Relations a Committee of Redaction of Le Monde Libertaire and a Committee of Administration. In 1955 a Commission on Syndicalist Relations was established within the FA as proposed by anarcho- syndicalist members. Regrouping behind Robert and Beaulaton, some activists of the former Entente anarchiste quit the FA and created on November 25, 1956, in Bruxelles the AOA (Alliance ouvri√®re anarchiste), which edited L‚ÄôAnarchie and would drift to the far-right during the Algerian war. The French Surrealist group led by Andr√© Breton now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the F√©d√©ration Anarchiste.\\"It was in the black mirror of anarchism that surrealism first recognised itself,\\" wrote Andr√© Breton in \\"The Black Mirror of Anarchism,\\" Selection 23 in Robert Graham, ed., Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas, Volume Two: The Emergence of the New Anarchism (1939-1977). Breton had returned to France in 1947 and in April of that year Andre Julien welcomed his return in the pages of Le Libertaire the weekly paper of the Federation Anarchiste\\"\\"1919-1950: The politics of Surrealism\\" by Nick Heath In 1952 Breton wrote \\"It was in the black mirror of anarchism that surrealism first recognised itself.\\" \\"Breton was consistent in his support for the francophone Anarchist Federation and he continued to offer his solidarity after the Platformists around Fontenis transformed the F√©d√©ration anarchiste into the Federation Communiste Libertaire. He was one of the few intellectuals who continued to offer his support to the FCL during the Algerian war when the FCL suffered severe repression and was forced underground. He sheltered Fontenis whilst he was in hiding. He refused to take sides on the splits in the French anarchist movement and both he and Peret expressed solidarity as well with the new F√©d√©ration anarchiste set up by the synthesist anarchists and worked in the Antifascist Committees of the 60s alongside the F√©d√©ration anarchiste.\\"  The Fifth Republic (1958) and May 1968  Many leaders of the Mouvement du 22 Mars, the March 1968 decentralized student protest in Nanterre, came from small anarchist groups. The anarchists rejected the Anarchist Federation, which they described as dogmatic, and instead mixed with other revolutionaries, such as Trotskyites and other militants. Anarchism was in a lull at the time of the radical May 1968 events. It was minimally present in, and gained no momentum from, the events. Even the Situationists, who held similar positions, bristled at being publicly grouped with the anarchists. Daniel Gu√©rin's Anarchism: From Theory to Practice was popular during the May 1968 events. F√©d√©ration anarchiste During the events of May 68 the anarchist groups active in France were F√©d√©ration anarchiste, Mouvement communiste libertaire, Union f√©d√©rale des anarchistes, Alliance ouvri√®re anarchiste, Union des groupes anarchistes communistes, Noir et Rouge, Conf√©d√©ration nationale du travail, Union anarcho-syndicaliste, Organisation r√©volutionnaire anarchiste, Cahiers socialistes libertaires, √Ä contre-courant, La R√©volution prol√©tarienne, and the publications close to √âmile Armand. In the seventies the FA evolved into a joining of the principles of both synthesis anarchism and platformism. Today the FA is constituted of about one hundred groups around the country.\\"Les groupes/liaisons/individuels de la FA\\" by Federation Anarchiste It publishes the weekly Le Monde Libertaire and runs a radio station called Radio libertaire.Radio Libertaire Notable names within French anarchism See also Category:French anarchists. * Pierre Joseph Proudhon (1809‚Äì1865), philosopher * Joseph D√©jacque (1821‚Äì1864) * Anselme Bellegarrigue * Louise Michel (1830‚Äì1905), school teacher and communarde * Elis√©e Reclus (1830‚Äì1905), geographer * Peter Kropotkin (1842‚Äì1921).

The village lies about southwest of Malmesbury and north of Chippenham. The Fosse Way, a Roman road, forms the western boundary of the parish. The Gauze Brook, a tributary of the Bristol Avon, crosses the parish from southwest to northeast. History A settlement of 35 households at Hunlavintone was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, and at that time the land was held by Ralf de Mortimer. The place-name means 'the town of Hunlaf's people'.Eilert Ekwall, Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place- names, p. 256. The spelling Hunlavyngton is recorded in 1418.Plea Rolls of the Court of Common Pleas; National Archives; CP 40/629, dated 1418; http://aalt.law.uh.edu/H5/CP40no629/aCP40no629fronts/IMG_0115.htm; second entry, line 1, home of Ralph Heyne, husbandman Hullavington church and manor belonged to the abbey of Saint-Victor-en-Caux (Saint-Victor-l'Abbaye, Seine- Maritime) in the early Middle Ages. The establishment also had Clatford manor, some to the southeast, and was known as Clatford Priory or Hullavington Priory. In 1443 its land was given to Eton College, who retained it until 1958. The monastic house was presumably northwest of the church; Court House was built on that site in the 16th century, with alterations and extension in the 17th and later centuries. Bradfield (north of Hullavington village) and Surrendell (in the west of the modern parish) were recorded in the Domesday Book and became medieval hamlets, then declined to single farmsteads. Bradfield had 21 poll-tax payers in 1377 but by the later 15th century there were no buildings beyond the manor house and its farm. Bradfield Manor Farmhouse, now Grade I listed, is described by Pevsner as a \\"rare survival of a C15 hall\\". Surrendell had a church in 1249, and 37 poll-tax payers in 1377. A manor house was built in the 16th century and Surrendell farmhouse was begun c. 1620-40. The church was in ruins in the late 17th century and the manor house was demolished c. 1871. A pillow mound rabbit warren, some 36 metres in length, survives near Surrendell Farm. Schooling began in a small way in the village in 1690. Two small schools, which became National Schools, were built in 1832 and 1833; the larger of them, on the east side of The Street, was enlarged in 1873 and became the sole school in 1879. A new school was built on the northern edge of the village in 1970. In 1903 the Great Western Railway opened the South Wales Main Line which passes to the north of Hullavington village, and had a station on the road towards Norton. The station closed to passengers in 1961 and to goods traffic in 1965; the line remains in use but there are no longer any local stations on this stretch between Swindon and Bristol Parkway. The parish population at the beginning of the nineteenth century was 395 (1801 census), rising to 823 in 1901 and was 1,223 in 2011.  Parish church  St Mary's Church The Church of England parish church of St Mary was begun in the 12th century. The three-bay north arcade is from the late 12th while the south arcade and northeast Bradfield chapel are from the 13th. The timber roof of the north aisle is 15th century, and there are pew ends from the same period. Restoration took place in the early 1870s and the tower was rebuilt in 1880, both to designs of A.W. Blomfield or his nephew Reginald Blomfield. At one time the church had a plaque commemorating the death at Malmesbury in 1703 of Hannah Twynnoy, believed to be the first person in Britain to have been killed by a tiger. The church was designated as Grade I listed in 1959. The parish is now one of eight served by the Gauzebrook group ministry. Governance The village falls within the By Brook electoral ward. The ward starts in the north east at Hullavington then stretches south west through Grittleton and Nettleton to Biddestone in the south. The ward population taken at the 2011 census was 4,523. Amenities Hullavington has a garage, a shop, a pub and two churches, one of which meets in the village hall. The village school continues as Hullavington CofE Primary School, where pupils include those from families posted to Buckley Barracks. There are three Girlguiding units in Hullavington: Brownies, Rainbows and a Guide unit which opened in September 2007. Military connections Hullavington Airfield, formerly RAF Hullavington, is next to the village. Most of the airfield is in the neighbouring parish of Stanton St Quintin, along with the associated barracks which were renamed Buckley Barracks in 2003. Notable residents Jazz vocalist and pianist Jamie Cullum was brought up in Hullavington. The former MP Neil Hamilton and his wife Christine moved to Hullavington in October 2004.

He made his league debut, as a late substitute for Neil Illman, in Argyle's 2‚Äì0 win at home to Gillingham on 29 October 1996 and made one further appearance that season. He went on to make over 50 first team appearances for Plymouth, although over half of them were as a substitute. Although scoring just the one league goal whilst at Plymouth, it came in an extremely memorable and dramatic game. With Plymouth playing at Carlisle on the last day of the 1998/99 season, Carlisle needed to win to avoid relegation from the Football League. Phillips put Plymouth 1‚Äì0 up but Carlisle equalised and then subsequently scored the winning goal in injury time courtesy of their goalkeeper, Jimmy Glass. While at Plymouth, Phillips suffered a broken leg that many thought would end his playing career. He recovered and resumed his career, but failed to win a regular starting place and joined Conference South side, Weymouth in January 2001, initially on loan, but on a free transfer two months later. In February 2002, Phillips joined Newport County on loan until the end of the season as Weymouth tried to cut their wage bill. Over two seasons, Phillips made 67 appearances for Weymouth, scoring 33 goals, attracting attention from a number of higher level sides, including Reading and Yeovil Town (who he had a trial with in November 2002). On 22 February 2005, Phillips moved to Conference National side Exeter City along with teammate Steve Tully for an undisclosed fee. Phillips joined local rivals Torquay United for a fee of ¬£17,500 on a three-year deal on 21 June 2007 and quickly forged a successful partnership with Tim Sills. On 15 May 2008 he joined fellow Conference team Rushden & Diamonds for an undisclosed fee. In the January 2009 transfer window, Phillips left Rushden and rejoined Weymouth. He joined Cambridge United on 2 March. He left Cambridge at the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season to sign for Bath City on 14 July. He departed the club two years later after their relegation to the Conference South.

Education Dever received his BA from Milligan College in 1955, an MA from Butler University in 1959, and a BD from Christian Theological Seminary in 1959. He received his PhD from Harvard University in 1966. He describes himself as \\"an unreconstructed traditionalist by temperament and training.\\" Career =Excavations= Dever was director of the Harvard Semitic Museum-Hebrew Union College excavations at Gezer in 1966‚Äì71, 1984 and 1990; director of the dig at Khirbet el-K√¥m and Jebel Qacaqir (West Bank) 1967‚Äì71; principal investigator at Tell el-Hayyat excavations (Jordan) 1981‚Äì85, and assistant director, University of Arizona Expedition to Idalion, Cyprus, 1991, among other excavations. =Topics= He used his background in Near Eastern field archaeology to argue, in Did God Have a Wife? Archaeology and Folk Religion in Ancient Israel (2005), for the persistence of the veneration of Asherah in the everyday religion of 'ordinary people'Dever, William G. (2008) Did God Have a Wife ? Archaeology and Folk Religion in Ancient Israel (paperback edition). Cambridge: Eerdmans, page 314 in ancient Israel and Judah. Discussing extensive archaeological evidence from a range of Israelite sites, largely dated between the 12th and the 8th centuries BCE,Dever, William G. (2008) Did God Have a Wife? Archaeology and Folk Religion in Ancient Israel (paperback edition). Cambridge: Eerdmans, pages 110 - 175 Dever argued that this 'folk' religion, with its local altars and cultic objects, amulets and votive offerings, was representative of the outlook of the majority of the population, and that the Jerusalem-centred 'book religion' of the Deuteronomist circle set out in the Hebrew Bible was only ever the preserve of an elite, a 'largely impractical' religious ideal.Dever, William G. (2008) Did God Have a Wife? Archaeology and Folk Religion in Ancient Israel (paperback edition). Cambridge: Eerdmans, page 90 Dever's views on the worship of Asherah are based to a significant extent on inscriptions at Khirbet el-Qom and Kuntillet Ajrud (though see also his discussion of the significance of a cultic stand from TaanachDever, William G. (2008) Did God Have a Wife? Archaeology and Folk Religion in Ancient Israel (paperback edition). Cambridge: Eerdmans, pages 153-54, 219-21.), as well as thousands of Asherah figurines that archaeologists have found in various Israel locations, including a dump near the First Temple (a dump he attributes to Josiah's iconoclastic reform efforts).An example of one of the Asherah figures that Dever discusses as illustrative of his thesis is illustrated here. His views on worship of the goddess as expressed in this book have been criticised by some. On his methodological approach more generally, Francesca Stavrakopoulou has suggested that his use of the term 'folk religion' 'ultimately endorses the old stereotype of 'popular' or 'folk' religion as the simplistic practices of rural communities', so perpetuating existing 'derogatory assumptions' that more recent discourses on the topic have sought to counter.Stavrakopoulou, Francesca (2010) 'Popular' Religion and 'Official' Religion: Practice, Perception, Portrayal. In Religious Diversity in Ancient Israel and Judah (Stavrakopoulou, Francesca and John Barton (editors)). London: T&T; Clark, pages 43-44. Others, however, praise Dever's contributions to understanding the history of Israel and Judah in the Iron Age.E.g., Aren M. Maeir, Oren Ackermann, and Hendrik J. Bruins, The Ecological Consequences of a Siege in , p. 239, Eisenbrauns (January 1, 2006) (\\"many seminal contributions to the field\\", \\"provided important insights\\"); Suzanne Richards, op. cit., p. 119 (\\"done more to advance our knowledge of the EB IV period than any other\\"); Jake R. McCarty and Eugene H. Merrill, Biblotheca Sacra, January‚ÄìMarch 2004, vol. 161, no. 1 (\\"vast and detailed knowledge\\"). =On the historicity of the Bible= In retirement, Dever has become a frequent author on questions relating to the historicity of the Bible. He has been critical of \\"Biblical minimalists\\" who deny any historical value to the biblical accounts. However he is far from being a supporter of biblical literalism either. Instead he has written: > I am not reading the Bible as Scripture‚Ä¶ I am in fact not even a theist. My > view all along‚Äîand especially in the recent books‚Äîis first that the biblical > narratives are indeed 'stories,' often fictional and almost always > propagandistic, but that here and there they contain some valid historical > information. That hardly makes me a 'maximalist.' and > Archaeology as it is practiced today must be able to challenge, as well as > confirm, the Bible stories. Some things described there really did happen, > but others did not. The Biblical narratives about Abraham, Moses, Joshua and > Solomon probably reflect some historical memories of people and places, but > the 'larger than life' portraits of the Bible are unrealistic and > contradicted by the archaeological evidence. However, Dever is also clear that his historical field should be seen on a much broader canvas than merely how it relates to the Bible: > The most na√Øve misconception about Syro-Palestinian archaeology is that the > rationale and purpose of 'biblical archaeology' (and, by extrapolation, > Syro-Palestinian archaeology) is simply to elucidate the Bible, or the lands > of the Bible =At Lycoming College (since 2008)= Dever joined the faculty at Lycoming College in autumn 2008. He was appointed Distinguished Professor of Near Eastern Archaeology.Announcement of appointment, Lycoming College. Regarding his new position, Dever commented: \\"For a small college to have so many students majoring in archaeology is unprecedented. To find students who are interested in the discipline and a faculty and administration that are supportive, augurs very well. It was really refreshing to see what a small college with a sense of community, of commitment, and of values was like.\\" Video lectures * A 2013 lecture by Dever on the Exodus is available on YouTube. He argues for existence of a historical Israel in the Iron Age, contrary to \\"revisionists\\" and \\"minimalists\\" such as Niels Peter Lemche. He concludes, however, in this lecture that in the much greater part the Exodus is a myth or \\"pseudo-history,\\" and that the early Israelites were mostly indigenous Canaanites. * A 2013 lecture by Dever on whether God had a wife (Asherah) is available on YouTube. In this lecture, he characterizes the Bible as a selective version of Israelite religion told by a right-wing clique of elites, and he argues that the majority of ordinary people were not monotheistic Yahwists and they venerated the \\"Great Goddess Asherah.\\"See the article Asherah#In Israel and Judah. He concludes by equating Asherah with the Shekinah in subsequent Judaism. * A similar 2014 lecture by Dever at Emory is available on YouTube.

It was founded in 1970. The members of the Society consider themselves responsible for recording the history and developing the theology of these grassroots movements that have influenced Christianity worldwide.  Overview  SPS was first envisioned by three classical Pentecostals, Dr. William W. Menzies of the Assemblies of God, Dr. H. Vinson Synan of the International Pentecostal Holiness Church, and Dr. Horace Ward of the Church of God. The original requirement for membership was adherence to the statement of faith of the Pentecostal Fellowship of North America. However, because nontrinitarians and others were unable to sign the statement for doctrinal reasons, this requirement was eventually eliminated. The purpose of the Society, as defined on its website, is to provide a scholarly forum in which to interpret the Pentecostal movement as well as \\"to stimulate, encourage, recognize, and publicize the work of Pentecostal and Charismatic scholars and scholars of Pentecostalism; to study the implications of Pentecostal theology in relation to other academic disciplines, seeking a Pentecostal world-and-life view; and to support fully, to the extent appropriate for an academic society, the following statement of purposes: -To encourage fellowship and facilitate co-ordination of effort among Pentecostal believers throughout the world. -To demonstrate to the world the essential unity of Spirit-baptized believers, fulfilling the prayer of the Lord Jesus Christ, ‚ÄúThat they all may be one‚Äù (John 17:21). -To cooperate in an endeavor to respond to the unchanging commission of the Lord Jesus, to carry His message to all people of all nations. -To promote courtesy and mutual understanding, ‚Äúendeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, until we all come in the unity of the faith‚Äù (Ephesians 4:3, 13). -To afford prayerful and practical assistance to any Pentecostal body in need of such. -To promote and maintain the scriptural purity of the Society by Bible study and prayer. -To uphold and maintain those Pentecostal truths, ‚Äúmost surely believed among us‚Äù (Luke 1:1).\\"http://www.sps-usa.org/ The Society holds annual conferences. The organization, which began as a scholarly branch of classical Pentecostalism, is now ecumenical, with over 500 members from all major Christian denominations. For many years, the Society has hosted the meetings of the Roman Catholic/Pentecostal dialogue (see Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity).  Past Presidents  * William W.

The show spawned two television films, Sala≈° u Malom Ritu and Zimovanje u Jakobsfeldu (Wintering in Jacobsfeld).  Synopsis  The show follows adventures of Milan Maljeviƒá, a teenager from the fictional Banatian village called Mali Rit (Little Swamp) during World War II. Mali Rit is a seemingly peaceful village, whose inhabitants do not resist to German occupation. In fact, partisans refrain from attacking the village, used as a secret base, cause they do not want to bring it to German attention. The village's peaceful life is only occasionally disturbed by the commander of a small German barrack within the village. However, everything in changed once when partisan saboteurs set fire on wheat destined to be transferred to Germany in a neighboring village. As act of reprisal, members of Deutsche Mannschaft take as hostages several men from that village. The Lorry stops in Mali Rit. Vasa, Milan's neighbor and best friend, angered by fact that everybody seemingly is scarred by Germans, gives water to the hostages, after the German commander beats him. In order to get revenge, Vasa decides to set fire to the wheat intended for Germany, hoping that Germans, who guarded the wheat, will share the same fate as the hostages. Unfortunately to him, Gestapo agent Georg Schitzer arrives in the village . Shcitzer soon became suspicious on loyalty of village people, 'cause Mali Rit is first village in which there was no anti-German activity prior to this fire. Soon he discovers a network of partisan agents in the village, among them are the owner of local tavern, local barber and Vasa's father. Convinced that he will scratch under the surface, Schitzer decides to take hostages (Paja, the owner of the tavern is shot at 6:00). Fearing for life of her son, Milan's mother decides to go in search for partisans to ask them to attack Mali Rit and liberate all hostages. The Partisans liberate all the hostages, and Milan and Petar join them. In second part of the show, Milan and Petar are with partisans, who are preparing for approaching winter. They will seek new shelter on other side of Danube, but this venture is too dangerous for young Milan, who doesn't want to be separated from his brother. So partisan commander decides to give Milan \\"special\\" assignment: to go to his mother and spend winter with her, taking with him a newcomer, rebellious teen called Ra≈°a. On the trip, Ra≈°a became seriously ill, and Milan goes in neighboring Volksdeutscher village called Jacobsfeld. He finds a job as servant of respected land owner Jacob Jerich. During night Milan goes in hut where he hides Ra≈°a, bringing him food. Later he hides Ra≈°a in Jerich's stable. Jacob gradually begun to see Milan as his son and plans to adopt him, under condition that Milan give up his non-German origin. In meantime, ≈†log, a partisan agent from the city learns, that runaway Ra≈°a is somewhere in Jacobsfeld and believes he is captured by Germans, so he begin to plot how to take Ra≈°a out.

It is occasionally referred to as \\"geobiology\\". Paleobiological research uses biological field research of current biota and of fossils millions of years old to answer questions about the molecular evolution and the evolutionary history of life. In this scientific quest, macrofossils, microfossils and trace fossils are typically analyzed. However, the 21st-century biochemical analysis of DNA and RNA samples offers much promise, as does the biometric construction of phylogenetic trees. An investigator in this field is known as a paleobiologist. Important research areas *Paleobotany applies the principles and methods of paleobiology to flora, especially green land plants, but also including the fungi and seaweeds (algae). See also mycology, phycology and dendrochronology. *Paleozoology uses the methods and principles of paleobiology to understand fauna, both vertebrates and invertebrates. See also vertebrate and invertebrate paleontology, as well as paleoanthropology. *Micropaleontology applies paleobiologic principles and methods to archaea, bacteria, protists and microscopic pollen/spores. See also microfossils and palynology. *Paleovirology examines the evolutionary history of viruses on paleobiological timescales. *Paleobiochemistry uses the methods and principles of organic chemistry to detect and analyze molecular-level evidence of ancient life, both microscopic and macroscopic. *Paleoecology examines past ecosystems, climates, and geographies so as to better comprehend prehistoric life. *Taphonomy analyzes the post-mortem history (for example, decay and decomposition) of an individual organism in order to gain insight on the behavior, death and environment of the fossilized organism. *Paleoichnology analyzes the tracks, borings, trails, burrows, impressions, and other trace fossils left by ancient organisms in order to gain insight into their behavior and ecology. *Stratigraphic paleobiology studies long-term secular changes, as well as the (short-term) bed-by-bed sequence of changes, in organismal characteristics and behaviors. See also stratification, sedimentary rocks and the geologic time scale. *Evolutionary developmental paleobiology examines the evolutionary aspects of the modes and trajectories of growth and development in the evolution of life ‚Äì clades both extinct and extant. See also adaptive radiation, cladistics, evolutionary biology, developmental biology and phylogenetic tree. Paleobiologists The founder or \\"father\\" of modern paleobiology was Baron Franz Nopcsa (1877 to 1933), a Hungarian scientist trained at the University of Vienna. He initially termed the discipline \\"paleophysiology.\\" However, credit for coining the word paleobiology itself should go to Professor Charles Schuchert. He proposed the term in 1904 so as to initiate \\"a broad new science\\" joining \\"traditional paleontology with the evidence and insights of geology and isotopic chemistry.\\"Schuchert is cited on page 170 of Cradle of Life: The Discovery of Earth's Earliest Fossils (Princeton: Princeton University Press) by J. William Schopf (1999). . On the other hand, Charles Doolittle Walcott, a Smithsonian adventurer, has been cited as the \\"founder of Precambrian paleobiology.\\" Although best known as the discoverer of the mid-Cambrian Burgess shale animal fossils, in 1883 this American curator found the \\"first Precambrian fossil cells known to science\\" ‚Äì a stromatolite reef then known as Cryptozoon algae. In 1899 he discovered the first acritarch fossil cells, a Precambrian algal phytoplankton he named Chuaria. Lastly, in 1914, Walcott reported \\"minute cells and chains of cell- like bodies\\" belonging to Precambrian purple bacteria.Walcott's contributions are described by J. William Schopf (1999) on pages 23 to 31. Another good source is E. L. Yochelson (1997), Charles Doolittle Walcott: Paleontologist (Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press). Later 20th-century paleobiologists have also figured prominently in finding Archaean and Proterozoic eon microfossils: In 1954, Stanley A. Tyler and Elso S. Barghoorn described 2.1 billion-year-old cyanobacteria and fungi-like microflora at their Gunflint Chert fossil site. Eleven years later, Barghoorn and J. William Schopf reported finely-preserved Precambrian microflora at their Bitter Springs site of the Amadeus Basin, Central Australia.The paleobiologic discoveries of Tyler, Barghoorn and Schopf are related on pages 35 to 70 of Schopf (1999). Finally, in 1993, Schopf discovered O2-producing blue-green bacteria at his 3.5 billion-year-old Apex Chert site in Pilbara Craton, Marble Bar, in the northwestern part of Western Australia. So paleobiologists were at last homing in on the origins of the Precambrian \\"Oxygen catastrophe.\\"The Apex chert microflora is related by Schopf (1999) himself on pages 71 to 100.

(, Domestic Order) is a 16th- century Russian set of household rules, instructions and advice pertaining to various religious, social, domestic, and family matters of the Russian society. Core Domostroy values tended to reinforce obedience and submission to God, Tsar and Church. Key obligations were fasting, prayer, icon veneration and the giving of alms. Its real author is unknown, but the most widespread version was edited by the archpriest Silvester, an influential advisor to young Ivan IV.Carolyn Johnston Pouncey, The Domostroi: Rules for Russian Households in the Time of Ivan the Terrible, p37 The text does include an epistle entitled \\"64. A Father's Epistle Instructing His Son,\\" which was written by Silvester instructing his son, Anthemius, on some of the larger themes found within the Domostroi. An updated edition of the Domostroy was compiled by Karion Istomin during the late 17th century. To modern researchers, it is a precious account about Russian society and the life of wealthy boyars and merchants. Modern researchers tend to trace the origins of the Domostroy to the 15th century Novgorod Republic, where it could have been used as a kind of moral codex for the wealthy. As such, it has some quotations from the Book of Proverbs and other biblical texts, and from earlier Russian moral texts such as Izmaragd and Zlatoust, and from some western texts such as Book of Christian Teachings (Czech) and Le M√©nagier de Paris (French). In modern Russia, the term Domostroy has a pejorative meaning. It is used in such classic texts as Herzen's My Past and Thoughts and Turgenev's Fathers and Sons to refer to a traditionalist way of life associated with patriarchal tyranny, as exemplified by the following quotations: \\"A wife which is good, laborious, and silent is a crown to her husband.\\" \\"Don't pity a youngling while beating him: if you punish him with a rod, he will not die, but become healthier.\\"  Structure  The book is divided into 67 sections (in Sil'vestr's version) dealing roughly with the following matters: * Religious practices * Relationship between Russian people and the tsar * Organization of the family * Management of the household * Culinary See also * Medieval cuisine  References  * Domostroy, SPb, Science, 1994 (from the presentation of the book) Category:16th century in Russia Category:Early Russian literature Category:16th-century Christian texts Category:Christianity and law in the 16th century Category:16th-century books Category:Works of unknown authorship Category:Medieval cookbooks ","title":"Domostroy"},{"id":"5658592","text":"Charlotte Ray is a beauty queen from Camden, New Jersey who competed in the Miss USA and Miss World pageants.

During his active career, he played more than 100 games for both German clubs Hannover 96 and 1. FC Kaiserslautern, winning the 1991‚Äì92 DFB- Pokal with Hannover and the 1997‚Äì98 Bundesliga championship with Kaiserslautern. He also represented Danish clubs Esbjerg fB and Odense BK. He played 44 games and scored three goals for the Denmark national football team, and was a participant at the international 1995 King Fahd Cup, Euro 1996, 1998 FIFA World Cup, and Euro 2000 tournaments. After suffering a career-ending injury in 2001, he became a football coach in 2003. He first became manager of Danish club Herf√∏lge BK in 2004, alongside Allan Nielsen. He has held a number of coaching and club official positions in his former German clubs, and was caretaker manager of Hannover 96 in 2006. Playing career Born in Esbjerg, Schj√∏nberg started his career as an attacking midfielder for hometown club Esbjerg fB, playing in 103 first team matches in total. He and Esbjerg teammate Jesper Kristensen went to a training session with Esbjerg native Allan Nielsen at Nielsen's German club FC Bayern Munich in the winter of 1989. =Hannover 96= When Bayern's amateur team coach Hans-Dieter Schmidt later became manager of German club Hannover 96, he remembered Schj√∏nberg and offered him a contract. In 1990, Schj√∏nberg moved abroad to play for the 2. Bundesliga side. At Hannover, he was converted to a defensive player, and eventually settled in as left wingback. He won his first trophy as a senior player, when the club surprisingly beat top flight Borussia M√∂nchengladbach, to win the 1991‚Äì92 DFB-Pokal. The game ended in a penalty shoot-out, where Schj√∏nberg scored the deciding kick to secure the triumph for Hannover 96. Unhappy with the new contractual offer from Hannover 96, Schj√∏nberg looked ready to move back to Denmark to play for Odense BK in summer 1992. After the DFB-Pokal win, he received an improved contract, and became team captain. However, he had a hard time getting into the Danish national team. After 123 league games and 12 goals for Hannover 96, he looked around for a new club in the summer of 1994. =Odense BK= Schj√∏nberg moved to Odense BK in 1994, in a transfer deal worth DKK 700,000. The transfer came, as Schj√∏nberg felt more likely to secure a place in the Danish national team when playing for a Danish club. He was called up for the national team in January 1995. With Odense, he reached the quarter-final of the 1994‚Äì95 UEFA Cup. It was Odense's greatest European result, as the club eliminated Spanish giants Real Madrid (against whom Schj√∏nberg scored in the first leg) before being narrowly defeated by Italian side AC Parma in the quarter-finals. =Kaiserslautern= After UEFA Euro 1996, he moved back to Germany, to play for 2. Bundesliga team 1. FC Kaiserslautern in a transfer deal worth DEM 1.35 million. In his first year at the club, 1. FC Kaiserslautern won promotion to the Bundesliga. His success continued, as the club remarkably went on to win the title upon their return to the top flight. Schj√∏nberg was an important part of this achievement. He scored the club's very first goal of the 1997‚Äì98 season, in the opening game against defending champions Bayern Munich. Ten minutes before the final whistle, Schj√∏nberg headed the ball in after a cross from Swiss midfielder Ciriaco Sforza and secured a 1‚Äì0 win. This victory was the beginning of Kaiserslautern's fairytale, and Schj√∏nberg went on to play 32 of 34 league games and to score four goals, as the club became the first ever 2. Bundesliga promotees to immediately win the Bundesliga title. Returning to Kaiserslautern after the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Schj√∏nberg was heavily injured early in the 1998‚Äì99 season. In September 1998, Schj√∏nberg collided with VfL Bochum goalkeeper Thomas Ernst, and broke his shinbone. He underwent a seven-month period of rehabilitation and returned in April 1999. Schj√∏nberg made a memorable appearance in the penultimate match of the 1999‚Äì2000 season. In the game against SC Freiburg, first-choice goalkeeper Georg Koch was injured and the substitute goalkeeper Uwe Gospodarek replaced him. By the half-time break, Gospodarek had suffered an injury of his own, and with no more goalkeepers selected for the match squad, Schj√∏nberg took over the keeper's gloves. In the 59th minute, Levan Kobiashvili scored against Schj√∏nberg to give SC Freiburg a 2‚Äì1 lead, but Schj√∏nberg otherwise kept his sheet clean. He crowned his achievement with a saved penalty kick, when he held the shot from Alexander Iashvili in the 84th minute. In Kaiserslautern's 2000‚Äì01 season, he suffered another injury in just the second game, against VfL Wolfsburg. He returned in December that year, and eventually regained his place back in the starting line-up. Such injuries caught up with him though, and due to old injuries and acute knee problems, he had to promptly terminate his football career after the 2000‚Äì01 season. He played 117 league games and scored 13 goals in his time for 1. FC Kaiserslautern. =International career= He made his debut for the Danish national team in the 1995 King Fahd Cup in January 1995. He played all three of Denmark's matches at the tournament, which they eventually won. He was also selected for the 1996 European Championship, where he played in Denmark's last two group games before elimination. After this memorable domestic season, Schj√∏nberg was selected to play for Denmark at the 1998 World Cup in France, where he played four of Denmark's five matches before elimination. He began the tournament as Denmark's starting left wingback, but eventually lost the place to Jan Heintze as the tournament progressed. He was called up to represent Denmark at Euro 2000, and started in Denmark's three matches before elimination. The last group match against the Czech Republic on 21 June 2000, would be Schj√∏nberg's last game for the national team. Managerial career After ending his active football career, Schj√∏nberg changed into the coaching business when he became youth coach at 1. FC Kaiserslautern in July 2003. He moved to Denmark in July 2004, to coach Danish Superliga club Herf√∏lge BK, alongside his good friend Allan Nielsen. Herf√∏lge BK were relegated to the Danish 1st Division, but Schj√∏nberg kept his job. In November 2005, he became assistant coach of Hannover 96 to manager Peter Neururer. When Neururer was fired in September 2006, Schj√∏nberg deputised as head coach for a single DFB-Pokal match, where Hannover 96 eliminated Dynamo Dresden. When Hannover 96 hired Dieter Hecking as new head coach, he brought Dirk Bremser with him as assistant coach, and Schj√∏nberg became the coach of the amateur ranks of the club. From 4 April 2007 until 7 November 2007 he was sports director of 1. FC Kaiserslautern. In the summer of 2008, he was appointed new sporting director of Danish club FC Vestsj√¶lland and was named as the head coach of the club on 1 April 2009, Schj√∏nberg replaced Jeppe Tengbjerg. He was sacked on 29 June 2011 due to a poor finish to the 2010‚Äì11 season. In January 2013, he was appointed as first-team coach with the Norwegian side V√•lerenga Fotball. V√•lerengas manager, Kjetil Rekdal, knew Schj√∏nberg from his time at Kaiserslautern where he had worked under him. In November 2014, he was appointed manager of Nest-Sotra Fotball in the Norwegian First Division. He was sacked already in May 2015.

The Osborne Fire Finder is a type of alidade used by fire lookouts in order to find a directional bearing (azimuth) to smoke in order to alert fire crews to a wildland fire. History and development The forerunner to the device was invented around 1840 by Sir Francis Ronalds to help combat fire in London ‚Äì he also named his innovation the ‚ÄúFire Finder‚Äù. Ronalds' fire finder comprised a theodolite atop a watchtower. Bearings and vertical angles from the horizon to surrounding features were recorded either on a surrounding cylinder in the form of a panorama or on a circular table at the base of the instrument. The location of any fire could thus be pinpointed even in the dark. The modern version was created by William \\"W.B.\\" Osborne, a United States Forest Service employee from Portland, Oregon, and has been in service since 1915. Mr. Osborne also designed the photo-recording transit for making panoramic records of forest conditions, as well as a collapsible water-bag knapsack for firefighting (U.S. patented in 1935). Many fire finders were manufactured from 1920 through 1935, but the manufacturer, Leupold & Stevens, Inc., stopped production of replacement parts after 1975. In recent years, with the resurgence and recovery of fire lookout towers, new Osborne devices were needed. The U.S. Forest Service, San Dimas Technology and Development Center (SDTDC) was contacted regarding the deteriorating condition of the Osborne Fire Finders housed in fire lookouts throughout the United States. A pilot program to create new Osbornes was coordinated with manufacturer Palmquist Tooling, Inc., and now Osborne Fire Finders are available again. Use The system is composed of a topographic map of the area oriented and centered on a horizontal table with a circular rim graduated in degrees (and fractions). Two sighting apertures are mounted above the map on opposite sides of the ring and slide around the arc. A USFS Fire Lookout using an Osborne Firefinder while on duty at Vetter Mountain, California. The device is used by moving the sights until the observer can peek through the nearer sighting hole and view the cross hairs in the further sight aligned with the fire. The fire lookout notes the degrees on the graduated ring beneath the sight. Early Fire Finders were capable of a crude estimate of elevation based upon the level and elevation of the table, calculating distance and rough position of the fire by reference to any distinctive terrain features and by use of the scale shown on the map. However, in actual practice, fire distance and location were normally established using two or more Fire Finder-equipped towers, using the intersection method to fix the precise location of the fire.Mooers Jr., Robert L., Finding Your Way In The Outdoors, Outdoor Life Press (1972), , pp. 129-131Guth, Peter, (Prof.), Craven, Tom, Chester, Tom, Shotwell, Jim, and O'Leary, Zeyn, ''Fire Locations From A Single Osborne Fire Finder and a DEM, Report to the ASPRS 2005 Annual Conference ‚ÄúGeospatial Goes Global: From Your Neighborhood to the Whole Planet‚Äù, Baltimore, MD (7‚Äì11 March 2005), pp. 1-10 Dispatchers at a central facility used a compass rose to mark lines of position from each reporting tower onto a large map to quickly find where the reported bearings intersect.

He was a commercial agent in New York and later a business owner in Cork. His business played a pivotal role in creating infrastructure that connected Dublin to Cork. Anderson purchased land in Fermoy that was later used as a military complex. Career Anderson was born into a poor family at Portland near Dumfries, Scotland and moved to Glasgow in 1784. He later settled in Cork City, at that time the major provisioning centre on the Atlantic Coast. During the American wars he earned considerable sums as a commercial agent in New York, and made extensive land purchases in the Cork area. His Cork enterprise was based at Lapp's Island, and his business acumen was recognised as he grew rapidly in fortune and was appointed to the city's committee of merchants. He was made a Freeman of the city in 1787. Among his business interests was a malting and warehouse complex at Ballinacurra on Cork Harbour in partnership with John Lapp, in the 1780s. In common with many Cork merchants he was in favour of union with Great Britain in 1800. Anderson's Quay in Cork is called after him. He married a Miss Semple and had two daughters and two sons, one of whom, James Caleb Anderson (1782‚Äì1861), was a noted experimenter with steam- driven road vehicles. His fortunes suffered a series of reversals with the fall in the value of land after the Napoleonic Wars, and he lost over ¬£30,000 in a Welsh mining venture. He had been conducting banking business and with the economic downturn his bank collapsed in 1816. =Development of roads and coaching= Anderson secured the equivalent of a government franchise to provide a mail service from Dublin to Cork. This involved the building of an extensive infrastructure of roads, bridges, inns and stage coach stations. By 1789 he was the dominant partner in the Dublin‚ÄìCork turnpike and mail line, which was extended to Limerick in 1793. Its paramount achievement was getting from Dublin to Cork within 24 hours, the first Royal Mail arriving in Cork 8 July 1789. =Founding of Fermoy= Anderson purchased lands in the Fermoy area in 1791 and responded to a British government demand for military barracks by offering to build to their order in Fermoy. The first barracks was for 1400 troops and 100 horses, later increased to a total of 3300 men. Soon a vast military complex with workshops and ancillary services together with coach workshops were functioning.

Ecology  The life strategies of the species in this family vary greatly. There are both solitary and gregarious species, living outside (ectoparasitoid) or inside their prey (endoparasitoid), koinobionts and idiobionts, primary parasitoids and hyperparasitoids and even predators that kill and consume the prey immediately. Because of their parasitoid nature, wasps of this family are often used as biological control agents for destructive pests such as american serpentine leafminers. Pteromalus cassotis is a parasitoid of the monarch butterfly.

It's better than \\"Quik Is the Name\\", it's a classic. It's hot, it's a new sound. I got the best collaborations, I got some real talented people. I made everybody sound the same, it's not like Nate Dogg sounds better than Wyclef Jean. It's not like that, it's a uniform record. Every record goes into the next record the right way. It's like a movie, it's not even like an album. It's real visual, you can see it and you can feel it. It's recorded real well, I used a lot of real new equipment. And I worked with some of the best musicians on the planet. So it's a unstoppable record, and I look forward to send all these fuckin producers back to the drawing board. And I'm the shit, I think I'm the best right now. Matter of fact, when you hear \\"Trauma\\", you gonna think I'm the best too\\".  Critical response  Trauma received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics. Allmusic gave the album 3.5/5 stars and wrote DJ Quik is the essence of West Coast hip-hop, having been there from the early days when Compton was asserting itself as the voice of rap as the 1980s bled into the '90s, and Trauma, the rapper/producer's seventh album and first in three years, finds Quik as relevant and potent in both lyrics and beats as when he dropped Quik Is the Name. Never flashy, Quik finds art in simplicity, as with the laid-back groove of \\"Black Mercedes,\\" and the rapid-fire spitting about relationships and distractions on \\"Catch 22.\\"https://www.allmusic.com/album/trauma-mw0000344074 Soren Baker of the Los Angeles Times wrote that On his seventh album, Quik enhances both his musicianship and his rapping, updating his sound by focusing on an airy, crisp production style that tones down the funk backbone and draws attention to the groove-driven guitar, horn, drum and turntable work that propels the sonic side of the album.  Commercial performance  The album debuted at number forty three on the US Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 24,000 copies in the United States.

The construction of Yarrow Reservoir was described in Wm.

The construction of the reservoir meant that a small hamlet called Alance was flooded, centred on the rebuilt Alance Bridge, and a large dwelling was demolished - Turner's Farm - which lives on in current maps only in name as Turner's Embankment.

It was built for Chorley Waterworks by the engineer John Frederick Bateman, who had estimated the cost of the project while working for Edwin Chadwick's Towns Improvement Company, and had then acted as Engineer for the project. The outlet consisted of a pipe running through the dam, and supported by two masonry piers where it ran through the central clay puddle. The outlet valve was at the downstream end of the dam, and although this configuration is no longer thought to be good practice, there have been no serious issues with the reservoir throughout its operational life. The earth dam had a maximum height of , was long and impounded of water. Popular with walkers, it forms part of the Anglezarke trail, although it is also accessible from Manor House. It was originally named Chorley Reservoir. There are a number of websites that state that High Bullough Reservoir is no longer used to supply drinking water, but the reservoir was still contained in a list of reservoirs in the Rivington Chain when United Utilities issued an application for a drought permit to reduce compensation flows to the River Yarrow in mid-2018. A huge staircase, made from timber, was created between the reservoir and nearby Manor House. Known as Jacob's Ladder, the remains can be seen on the east side of the water.

In the picture, barra brava of Club Atl√©tico Nueva Chicago, from Argentina, in the middle of the crowd. Barra brava (fierce gang) is the name of organized supporters' groups of football teams in Argentina analogous to European Ultras in providing fanatical support to their clubs in stadiums, specifically by provoking violence against rival fans as well as against the police. Actions such as exhibition of choreographies (like throwing smoke bombs, firecrackers, confetti and balloons and displaying giant flags that cover entire stands, or part of them, before the match's start) to welcome the team when it goes out to the pitch; waving and displaying of flags, banners and umbrellas; and coordination of chants (that accompany playing bass drums and trumpets and end up being sung by part or the rest of their team's crowd in the stadium while jumping or applauding) during the whole match, are characteristic of their fervent behavior, whose purpose is to encourage their team while intimidating referees and rival fans and players, for which they also provoke violence. They also look to attack rival fans (especially rival barras bravas), which leads to fights with them (most of the time outside of stadiums before or after matches, but sometimes during them in the stands), and defend the rest of their team' spectators from rival attacks (especially in away matches, where normally they are outnumbered by home fans) and police repression.'Reception' is the name that football fans from some countries give to the choreography that the crowds exhibit in the stadiums for welcoming their teams when they go out to the pitch. In the picture, fans of Club Atl√©tico Banfield, from Argentina, displaying a giant flag a few minutes before a match. These groups originated in Argentina in the 1950s and spread throughout countries. They are similar to hooligan firms (from United Kingdom), torcidas organizadas (from Brazil) and ultras (originally from Italy but spread to the most part of Europe and Asia, Australia and North Africa).  History  During the 1920s in Argentina, irregular groups of fervent fans spontaneously began to appear at football matches. These groups were denominated as barras by the media, a term that in Rioplatense Spanish slang is equivalent to the term gang, but in its original meaning (not necessarily associated to crime), that is 'an informal group of people (usually friends) who meet frequently and usually do common activities'. Their actions were limited to stadiums during home matches because they couldn't follow (at least the whole members) their teams to other cities very often, neither was violence provocation their objective, as violence arose spontaneously due to frustration caused by bad results of their team or as a way to influence the match through intimidation of rival players and referees with insults, throwing objects and occasionally entering onto the pitch to assault them. Sometimes they also attacked rival fans (usually barras also) who used the same methods against their team. At the end of this decade, a few newspapers described one of this groups as a barra \\"brava\\" (Spanish for fierce), appearing the words barra brava together for the first time, but not yet like a term. One of those groups, named La barra de la Goma (\\"The barra of the rubber\\") by the press, appeared in 1927 and supported San Lorenzo de Almagro. The nickname comes from the rubber of bike inner tubes (filled with sand, and tied with wire at the ends) that this group used in some occasions to attack rival fans. Sometimes they would also throw objects at the players of rival teams to bother them when they should intervene in the game. The Barras brava section of the stadium is recognizable for their flags, a characteristic unrivaled by other areas of the stadium has more quantity or density of such. In the picture, La Banda de Fierro is an organized supporter group of Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata. The barras became a traditional part of the Argentinian football crowds and evolved until, in the mid-1950s, they began receiving funding from football clubs to attend all the away matches. While intimidation towards referees and rival players and supporters was previously spontaneous, from that moment on it would be their main objective (along with encouraging their team). Another objective came to be defending the rest of spectators and players of their club from the attacks of rival fans (especially in away matches), and police repression, which increased fights and riots, that occurred more frequently before and after the matches outside of stadiums (although many also occurred on the terraces during the games, sometimes leading to their suspension). Thus, they became the first organized, violence- centered supporters' groups of football fans in the world (which later appeared as hooligan firms in United Kingdom, ultras in Italy and torcidas organizadas in Brazil). Independiente's barra brava with umbrellas and bass drums in 1960. Argentine journalist Am√≠lcar Romero stated that, before the appearance of such groups, when a team played away, it was intimidated by home fans. Barras bravas were a response to this pressure, so each club started to had its own barra brava, financed by the club leadership. These groups were given tickets and paid travel to the stadiums, and access to these benefits were controlled by the group's main members. To obtain prestige, the member had to be violent. In 1958, media has begun to notice the existence of barras bravas after the riots during a match between V√©lez Sarsfield and River Plate (at Jos√© Amalfitani Stadium), at which 18-year-old bystander Alberto Mario Linker was killed by police (he was accidentally hit in the head by a tear gas grenade thrown at point-blank range from a grenade launcher) when cops tried to disperse River Plate fans who were causing unrest in a terrace located behind one of the goals. Police and rioters were criticized by the media, and newspaper La Raz√≥n mentioned the existence of barras fuertes (strong gangs) in Argentine football that were already known by many people, differentiating them for the first time from the traditional barras as being more organized, hierarchical, and coordinated, as observed among River Plate' rioters on that occasion. Crowd of Club Deportivo 1¬∫ de Mayo (team that usually plays in one of the lowest divisions of Argentine football), from Chajar√≠, in the 1990s with its barra brava in the center (composed by a few tens of members in that moment). Barra brava is the currently term appeared in Argentine media in the 1960s, but became popular in the 1980s. Until the early 1990s, barra brava members in Argentina rejected that term (many even today) for considering it pejorative, and prefer being denominated as fanbase/crowd's guides (largely because if a supporter group it's identified as a defined group of people that is involved in illegal acts, the Argentine justice can judge the members as participants of an illicit association, a legal figure that hardens the penalties). Although there were many fights and riots carried out by fans since the beginnings of Argentine football, Argentinian players, club leaders, and police (with the first registered death caused by violence in 1923), the death of Alberto Mario Linker signaled the beginning of an era of habituation to violence. During the following decades, riots and deaths increased at the same time that barras bravas organized and multiplied. According to some studies, Argentina has the most dangerous organized supporters' groups in the world. Through August 2012 Argentine football has experienced more than 200 deaths related to hooliganism. Since 2013, all visiting fans were banned from matches of the first division.  Characteristics  These groups deploy and wave flags (that in Argentine football slang are called trapos -cloths-), banners and umbrellas (with their team's uniforms), and use musical instruments (such as drums and, since the mid-2000s, trumpets) to accompany their chants. They occupy terraces where viewers must stand, while in all- seater stadiums (rare in Argentina), barras bravas also remain standing throughout the match. The most characteristic flags are shaped like giant strips several meters in length (called trapos largos -long cloths- or tirantes -suspenders-), that are deployed from the top of the terrace to the bottom. Each group usually also has a banner with its name. Traditionally, many members (usually important ones) stand upon the crush barriers that are placed in terraces to prevent crushing. In order to not fall from there, they hold on from a \\"suspender\\" (this was the purpose for making these flags shaped like strips), the body of someone else that is by his side and sustained to the flag, or the hand of some supporter that is standing below (in the floor). They start and coordinate most of the chants, wave the most important flags, and always are located in the center of the terrace that they occupy. Until the group enters onto the terrace (usually a few minutes before or sometimes after the match starting), the center is not occupied by the crowd (even if the terrace it is almost filled). It is left empty to show respect for the place of the barra brava. Originally these groups were not very numerous or powerful. Over the years, this changed to the point of cases where the barra brava decided who would be the club's chairman. Since the 1980s and 1990s, hooliganism has grown and some groups engaged in illegal activities such as extorting money from club leadership, players and hawkers that work at the stadium and surroundings, sell tickets (that are given by club leaders) to matches on the black market,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/46341666 charge for parking in the vicinity of the stadium, etc. Many members also steal (participating in burglaries, larcenies and robberies, sometimes even being part of criminal organizations) or sell drugs as a way to obtain money for travels (club leaders don't pay the travel for the whole group when the destination is too far), the making of flags or buying elements (balloons, confetti, pyrotechnics, etc.) used in the team's receptions on the pitch. They often provide services to political and union leaders who hire them as agitator groups (during rallies and mass meetings, that in Argentina traditionally have people chanting like football crowds, playing drums and even shooting firecrackers), goon squads (clashing with supporters of other political parties, unions or police during demonstrations, protests, rallies and strikes), bodyguards, etc. They are funded also by club leadership, which may give salaries to some members or even a percentage of the profits. Also, when the stadium of some club is used for a non-football event (like concerts), usually the club's barra brava members are employed as security guards to take care of the facilities. V√©lez Sarsfield's barra brava) located in the center of the main terrace of Jos√© Amalfitani Stadium (from Buenos Aires) with its \\"suspenders\\". In Argentina, since the 2000s, a large percentage of deaths related to football were related to internal disputes within barras bravas, emerging subgroups into it that sometimes even had it own names. The size of a barra brava is generally related to the level of the club's popularity. However, some clubs have big supporters' groups without being very popular (this usually occurs when the club has, at least, a relatively high popularity in a high populated working class zone of an urban area). Group sizes range from a dozen of members in very small clubs, to more than a thousand in important ones (groups with several hundred of members or more started to appear in the 1980s -before that decade such groups weren't so big-), all of them with a hierarchical structure that gets stronger and more complex when the group's size is bigger. There are also many small clubs (with very few fans) that don't have a barra brava.

Deprotonation is aided by electron- withdrawing properties of substituent R. Several reaction modes exist for the actual rearrangement reaction. A concerted reaction requires an antarafacial reaction mode but since the migrating group displays retention of configuration this mechanism is unlikely. In an alternative reaction mechanism the N‚ÄìC bond of the leaving group is homolytically cleaved to form a di- radical pair (3a). In order to explain the observed retention of configuration, the presence of a solvent cage is invoked. Another possibility is the formation of a cation-anion pair (3b), also in a solvent cage.

He was more minimalist than others in the movement, and his tendency was to draw relatively few figures, and only rarely overlap them. His works were normally inscribed \\"Euthymides painted me\\". Euthymides was a rival of his fellow Athenian Euphronios, and one of his amphorae is additionally marked with the playful taunt \\"hos oudepote Euphronios\\", words which have been variously interpreted as \\"as never Euphronios [could do]\\", or \\"this wasn't one of Euphronios\\".

On 22 February 1901, the vessel sank after striking a submerged reef at the entry to San Francisco Bay while inward bound from Hong Kong. Of the approximately 220 passengers and crew on board, fewer than 85 people survived the sinking, while 135 others were killed in the catastrophe. The wreck lies in of water just off the Golden Gate and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as nationally significant. City of Rio de Janeiro was one of many ships that were lost due to challenging navigational conditions in this area. History Launched on 6 March 1878, the City of Rio de Janeiro was originally built for the United States & Brazil Mail Steamship Company, a two-ship shipping line between Brazil and the United States. This proved unprofitable, and she was sold to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company in 1881 and refitted to serve as an ocean liner, traveling between her home port in San Francisco to Honolulu, Hawaii, Yokohama, Japan and Hong Kong. Alfred Daniel Jones, the Consul General of the United States in Shanghai died on board in 1893. He had had a nervous breakdown in Shanghai. He became violent and had to be restrained with manacles while on board. He raved incessantly for a number of days before dying.Consul Jones' Remains, The Weekly Banner, December 26, 1893; North China Herald, 1 December 1893 In early March 1896, she ran out of coal while on passage between San Francisco and Hawaii, only reaching Honolulu by burning her wooden topmasts and deckhouses as fuel. In 1898 the US Government leased the ship for a short time to ferry troops to Manila in the Philippines as part of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War.. After the war, she went back to her usual Pacific route. Sinking An artist's depiction of the wreck. On 22 February 1901, while trying to pass through the Golden Gate in heavy fog, en route to her home port of San Francisco, the City of Rio de Janeiro collided with rocks, reportedly on the southern part of the straits at or near Fort Point, and sank stern first. The damage to the ship was considerable. Much of the entire underside of the vessel had been ripped open by the collision, allowing seawater to rapidly fill the cargo holds and engine room. The ship was built in 1878, before watertight bulkheads came into use, thus it sank in less than ten minutes. The wreck was later found in of water. There was much confusion because the officers were English-speaking Americans, while the seamen were non-English-speaking Chinese. The result was that few lifeboats were launched. The catastrophe happened quickly and in dense fog. The lookout at the Fort Point Lifesaving Station, only a few hundred yards away, was unaware of the situation for two hours, until a lifeboat was sighted emerging from the fog. Fortunately Italian fishermen were nearby and were able to rescue survivors clinging to floating wreckage. One of those rescuers, Gaspare Palazzolo of Terrasini, Sicily, Captain of the boat Citta di N.Y., was awarded a gold medal by the Banco Italo-Americana di San Francisco for his heroism. Of the 210 people aboard, 82 were rescued but 128 people died. The captain, William Ward, was among the dead. He had previously said that if ever faced with such a situation, he would go down with his ship. Among those lost in the wreck was Rounsevelle Wildman, the US Consul General at Hong Kong, and his wife and two children, who had been en route for Washington DC to participate in the inauguration of William McKinley. Soon after the sinking of the SS City of Rio de Janeiro, the United States Congress approved funding for a lighthouse on Mile Rocks, where the sinking took place. A bell buoy had been previously placed in 1889 by the United States Lighthouse Service near the rocks; however, strong currents in the area would pull the buoy beneath the surface of the water and set it adrift. Cargo After the shipwreck, rumors circulated that the ship's cargo had included a substantial amount of gold and silver, but her manifest listed no such cargo. However, the manifest did list 2,423 slabs of tin, each of which weighed . The ship's insurers paid a sum of $79,000 for the loss of the metal, which on December 13, 2014, market prices would be worth in excess of $2,900,000.http://www.metalprices.com/p/Metal_Index Salvage attempts Photo with a line showing the probable course of the SS City of Rio de Janeiro as published by Popular Science Monthly in 1901 Divers engaged by the Pacific Mail Line immediately began a search for the ship but failed to find any traces of it due to the depth of the water in the area, well beyond the diving or salvage capabilities of the time. For several years after the disaster, bodies washed up on the beach near Fort Point, including, in July 1902, the remains of Captain Ward, which were identified by the watch chain wrapped around his rib cage. On November 15, 1905, the Los Angeles Herald reported that divers had found the wreck. It was asserted that there was no doubt of the identity of the wreckage found. One diver had a narrow escape from death during his exploration of the bottom of the Golden Gate.. In 1917, a wooden keg clearly marked Rio de Janeiro surfaced off Point Lobos. In 1919, more wreckage from the ship surfaced off Suisun Bay, away from the assumed site of the wreck between Mile Rock and Baker Beach. Off Baker Beach, the currents are too strong and the water too deep for anyone other than professional divers. It has also been suggested that the currents may have pushed the ship out to sea as she sank, while some say that she could not be found because of the number of wrecks on the seabed in the area, and that even using modern sonar it would be impossible to distinguish whatever remains of the ship from all the other disintegrated remnants of sunken ships. In 1931 Captain Haskell made a formal claim for the cargo and fabric of the wreck by right of discovery; he announced to a news conference that he had discovered the wreck using a two- man submarine of his own invention and planned to salvage $6 million worth of silver from the wreck. However, he disappeared without a trace in July 1931. In 1987, Gus Cafcalas, a San Francisco-area mortgage banker, announced that he and four other men had discovered the wreck the previous fall in 200 feet of water, half a mile west of the Golden Gate Bridge, aided by sonar and photographs taken by a robot submarine. Cafcalas said they would not attempt to raise the ship because the condition of the hull and fierce tides and currents made the task virtually impossible, but that they hoped to probe the ship's interior for the rumored cargo of silver. He said the consortium was prepared to spend $1 million to salvage whatever was left on the wreck. Cafcalas and his partners applied for a salvage permit from the California State Lands Commission under the name Segamb, Inc. (listed in several media reports as ‚ÄúSeagamb Corp.‚Äù), and on February 6, 1989, the Commission authorized the issuance of a permit ‚Äúfor survey and mapping purposes, and retrieval of an object or objects sufficient to positively identify the shipwreck‚Äù, subject to numerous conditions. However, Segamb never met the conditions, and the authorization was revoked on January 17, 1990. The wreck of the Rio de Janeiro was located again in November 2014 and imaged in detail using sonar. There are no plans to salvage her. Notes References  External links  * * .

History WDAV signed on in 1973 as a student-run college radio station,http://www.wdav.org/15_45_62.cfm taking over from a carrier current station that had been on the air since 1969. The format included jazz, rock music and educational programs.Jeff Borden, \\"Davidson Students Enjoy Alternative Rock on WDAV's 'Flipside',\\" The Charlotte Observer, August 26, 1986, p. 13A. In 1978, it was upgraded to a full-service professional operation. However, student volunteers quit because they did not want the station to go all classical, and it took three months to return to the air. WDAV became \\"Your station for the arts\\" and played mostly classical music. The students asked for another carrier current station, and WALT 1610 came on the air. After years of on and off broadcasting, WALT has been reinstated and operated by students since 2014. WDAV began offering alternative rock for two hours a night on weeknights, and jazz on weekend nights, starting at 11:00. \\"Flipsides\\"'and \\"Jazzsides,\\" hosted by students, featured music from over 2000 albums and rock artists such as H√ºsker D√º, Meat Puppets, Fetchin Bones, The Replacements, P.I.L., Mojo Nixon and Skid Roper.

In January 2015, after 20 years, WDAV decided to no longer run NPR news updates at the top of each hour, since listeners tended to change stations if they did not want news, and those who did want news listened to other stations. The size of the audience increased. In August 2016, WDAV was the number one classical station in the country according to Nielsen Media Research. Half of listeners were over 55, but a fourth were less than 35 years old. As of 2018, 21 percent of the audience was 18 to 34. The station had three podcasts already and planned two more.

Early films of Santa revolve around similar simple plots of Santa's Christmas Eve visit to children. In 1897, in a short film called Santa Claus Filling Stockings, Santa Claus is simply filling stockings from his pack of toys. Another film called Santa Claus and the Children was made in 1898. A year later, a film directed by George Albert Smith entitled Santa Claus (or The Visit from Santa Claus in the United Kingdom) was created. In this picture, Santa Claus enters the room from the fireplace and proceeds to trim the tree. He then fills the stockings that were previously hung on the mantle by the children. After walking backward and surveying his work, he suddenly darts at the fireplace and disappears up the chimney. Santa Claus' Visit in 1900 featured a scene with two little children kneeling at the feet of their mother and saying their prayers. The mother tucks the children snugly in bed and leaves the room. Santa Claus suddenly appears on the roof, just outside the children's bedroom window, and proceeds to enter the chimney, taking with him his bag of presents and a little hand sled for one of the children. He goes down the chimney and suddenly appears in the children's room through the fireplace. He distributes the presents and mysteriously causes the appearance of a Christmas tree laden with gifts. The scene closes with the children waking up and running to the fireplace just too late to catch him by the legs. A 1909 film by D. W. Griffith titled A Trap for Santa Claus shows children setting a trap to capture Santa Claus as he descends the chimney, but instead capture their father who abandoned them and their mother but tries to burglarize the house after he discovers that she inherited a fortune. A 29-minute 1925 silent film production titled Santa Claus, by explorer/documentarian Frank E. Kleinschmidt, filmed partly in northern Alaska, feature Santa in his workshop, visiting his Eskimo neighbors, and tending his reindeer. A year later, another movie titled Santa Claus was produced with sound on De Forest Phonofilm. Over the years, various actors have donned the red suit (aside from those discussed below), including Leedham Bantock in Santa Claus (1912), Monty Woolley in Life Begins at Eight-thirty (1942), Alberto Rabagliati in The Christmas That Almost Wasn't (1966), Dan Aykroyd in Trading Places (1983), Jan Rubes in One Magic Christmas (1985), David Huddleston in Santa Claus: The Movie (1985), Jonathan Taylor Thomas in I'll Be Home for Christmas (1998), and Ed Asner in Elf (2003). Later films about Santa vary, but can be divided into the following themes shown below. Origins in film Some films about Santa Claus seek to explore his origins. They explain how his reindeer can fly, where the elves come from, and other questions that children have generally asked about Santa. Two Rankin/Bass stop motion animation television specials addressed this issue: the first, Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town (1970), with Mickey Rooney as the voice of Kris Kringle, reveals how Santa delivered toys to children despite the fact that the evil Burgermeister Meisterburger had forbidden children to play with them; and the second, The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus (1985), based on L. Frank Baum's 1902 children's book of the same name, follows Santa being reared by a collection of mythical creatures who finally grant him immortality. Another animated version of Baum's book was made by Glen Hill in 2000, and the book also served as the basis for an anime series, Shounen Santa no Daib√¥ken (Young Santa's Adventures) in 1994 and The Oz Kids video, Who Stole Santa? (1996). None of these films focus on Santa Claus's saintly origins. Questioning and believing Another genre of Santa Claus films seeks to dispel doubts about his existence. One of the first films of this nature was titled A Little Girl Who Did Not Believe in Santa Claus (1907) and involves a well-to-do boy trying to convince his poorer friend that Santa Claus is real. She doubts because Santa has never visited her family because of their poverty. Miracle on 34th Street (1947), starring Natalie Wood as Susan Walker, revolves around the disbelief of young Susan, whose mother (Maureen O'Hara) employs a kind old man (Edmund Gwenn, who won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor) to play Santa Claus at Macy's; he later convinces Susan that he really is Santa. Yes, Virginia (2009) is an animated holiday TV special based on the true story of a young girl, Virginia O'Hanlon, who writes a letter to the editor of the New York Sun in 1897 after her friends tell her that there is no Santa. The newspaper editor tells her that indeed there is a Santa: \\"He lives, and he lives forever.\\" Francis Pharcellus Church was the real-life editor and is played by Charles Bronson in the special. The Polar Express (2004), based on the children's book of the same name, also deals with issues and questions of belief as a magical train conducted by Tom Hanks transports a doubting boy to the North Pole to visit Santa Claus. Santa as a hero Some less-than-serious films feature Santa Claus as a superhero-type figure, such as the 1959 film titled Santa Claus produced in Mexico with Jos√© El√≠as Moreno as Santa Claus. In this movie, Santa allies with Merlin the magician to battle the devil, who is attempting to trap Santa. In the Cold War-era film Santa Claus Conquers the Martians (1964), Santa Claus is captured by Martians and brought to Mars, and ultimately foils a plot to destroy him. The Night They Saved Christmas (1984), starring Art Carney as Santa, likewise chronicles how Santa Claus and Claudia Baldwin (Jaclyn Smith), the wife of an oil explorer, have to save the North Pole from explosions while Baldwin's husband is searching for oil in the Arctic. Santa Claus: The Movie also contains a subplot in which Santa Claus rescues Joe (Christian Fitzpatric) from his best friend Cornelia's (Carrie Kei Heim) evil step-uncle B. Z. (John Lithgow). Santa is a hero in The Nightmare Before Christmas, held captive by Oogie Boogie, although he is spiteful and enraged at Jack when freed. The latest films to depict Santa Claus in such a manner are The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005), and the DreamWorks film Rise of the Guardians. In the Chronicles of Narnia film, Father Christmas (James Cosmo) supplies the Pevensie children with the weapons and tools they need to battle the White Witch (Tilda Swinton). In Rise of the Guardians, where is he referred to often as North (Alec Baldwin), is shown as one of the main characters and leader of the Guardians, who are the heroes of the movie. In the show South Park, Santa is often depicted with firearms; in the episode \\"Red Sleigh Down\\", he battles Iraqis to try to bring Christmas to Iraq. In the episode \\"A Woodland Critter Christmas\\", he uses a combat shotgun to blast away Satanic animals who try to give birth to the AntiChrist. Santa (played by Nick Frost) made a brief appearance at the end of the Doctor Who episode, \\"Death in Heaven\\". In the following episode, which served as the show's 2014 Christmas special, \\"Last Christmas\\", he plays a more prominent role. It is eventually revealed that the scenes with him are the characters experiencing a shared dream, and he is their subconscious trying to help them wake up before they are killed. At the episode's end, he successfully awakens the Doctor and Clara, reuniting the two. Succession of Santas One genre of movies suggests that Santa Claus is not historically a single individual but a succession of individuals. The feature film Santa Claus: The Movie (1985), starring David Huddleston as Santa Claus and British actress Judy Cornwell as his wife Anya, shows how Santa and Anya are discovered by a clan of elves called the Vendequm. (Dudley Moore portrays Patch, the central character and main focus of the story; Burgess Meredith portrays their wise leader, the Ancient One, who reveals that Claus represents the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy, whereby he has been designated as \\"the Chosen One\\", whose mission it will be to deliver the elves' toys to children all over the world. The film's prologue features Claus and Anya performing Santa-like duties in their home village, and strongly suggests Santa's saintly origins. In Ernest Saves Christmas (1988), Ernest P. Worrell (Jim Varney) joins the challenge of Santa Claus, alias Seth Applegate (Douglas Seale), to convince Florida kids' show host Joe Carruthers (Oliver Clark) to become the next Santa. In The Santa Clause (1994), Tim Allen plays Scott Calvin, who accidentally causes Santa Claus to fall off the roof of his house. After he puts on Santa's suit, he becomes subject to the \\"Santa Clause\\" (like a contract), which requires him to become the next Santa. Despite his average appearance, over the next year he grows fat, his hair whitens, and he grows a beard by magic in order to look the part. Reluctant at first, he falls in love with his newfound role. This film spawned two sequels. In 2002's The Santa Clause 2, he must find a wife (the \\"Mrs. Clause\\"), and in 2006's The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause, he must battle Jack Frost for control of the North Pole. A recent and unique television special also draws upon the succession theme; in Call Me Claus (2001), Lucy Cullins (Whoopi Goldberg) is an African American woman destined to become the next Santa Claus. She, too, is reluctant to take on the role. In The Hebrew Hammer (2003), the role of Santa Claus is traditionally passed down from father to son. The system is disrupted when the reigning Santa is murdered by his son, Damian, who then uses the position to attack the competing holidays of Hanukkah and Kwanzaa. The animated film Arthur Christmas portrays being Santa Claus as a dynasty. The first \\"Santa\\", Saint Nicholas, established the North Pole workshop and passed the title and responsibilities to his son after 70 Christmases, after which his son passed them on to his son, and so on. In the film, the current Santa initially refuses to retire, due to worry about what he will be if he is not Santa. Impostor Santas Several films have been created which explore the consequences should an impostor Santa take over. Probably one of the first films featuring a fake Santa Claus is the 1914 silent film, The Adventure of the Wrong Santa Claus, written by Frederic Arnold Kummer. In this film, a bogus Santa steals all the Christmas presents and amateur detective Octavius (played by Herbert Yost) tries to recover them. Arguably the most notorious impostor appears in the 1966 cartoon based on Dr. Seuss's children's book, How the Grinch Stole Christmas!, wherein the Grinch attempts to rob the Whos in Whoville of their Christmas, but has a change of heart when he sees that he has not done this after all. This animated feature was made into a live-action movie in 2000, directed by Ron Howard and starring Jim Carrey as the Grinch. Another less- than-friendly impostor appears in A Christmas Story (1983) as a disgruntled mall Santa at Higbee's Department Store (a real store in downtown Cleveland, Ohio) in the fictional town of Holman, Indiana. Played by Jeff Gillen, Santa is depicted as a larger-than-life figure who terrifies, rather than amuses, children. Gillen's performance lends credence to the theory that the mall Santa is not quite genuine. Another recent devious mall Santa was played by Billy Bob Thornton in Bad Santa (2003), a film which gained the normally family-friendly Disney \\"bad press\\". Tim Burton's stop-action animated musical film, The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), depicts Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, wanting to become Santa Claus after an accidental visit to Christmas Town. After the mostly well-meaning but totally clueless Halloween Town citizens capture Santa, they then try to take over Christmas with disastrous results; the real Santa is almost killed by Oogie Boogie. Santa is voiced here by Ed Ivory and in the video game spinoffs by Corey Burton. Other, darker impostors have appeared in slasher films such as the first three films of the five-film Silent Night, Deadly Night series, Santa Claws and Santa's Slay, and in the short \\"...And All Through the House\\", part of the horror anthology film Tales from the Crypt (1972) and later remade as episode 1.2 and directed by Robert Zemeckis for the HBO TV series of the same name. Both versions were inspired by the comic bookTales from the Crypt.

Throughout his playing career, Berner played predominantly as a left back, but was also deployed in other roles, such as central defence, left wing and also in central midfield towards the end of his career at Leicester City. He spent most of his career playing for Grasshopper Club Z√ºrich, SC Freiburg, FC Basel and Leicester City. Club career =FC Basel= Berner joined FC Basel from SC Freiburg. For Basel he made 46 appearances, 32 in the Swiss Super League, two in the Swiss Cup and 12 in the 2005‚Äì06 UEFA Cup. =Blackburn Rovers= Berner moved to Blackburn Rovers for a nominal fee from FC Basel on 30 January 2007. He was given the squad number 25. On 10 February 2007, he played his first Premiership match for Blackburn, in a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Everton. He made his second start against Manchester City on 27 December 2007. He was released from his contract on 19 May 2008, along with fellow Switzerland defender St√©phane Henchoz. On 3 July 2008, Berner joined Norwich City on trial, joining up with the squad for pre-season training, however he failed to gain a contract. =Leicester City= Berner playing against Oxford United in a pre-season friendly, 24 July 2010 On 12 September 2008, Berner joined Leicester City on a three-year contract and was issued the number 31 shirt. The club had beaten the likes of Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest for his signature. He made his debut in a Football League Trophy match against Lincoln City at the Walkers Stadium on 23 September, drawing 0‚Äì0 but winning 3‚Äì1 on penalties. He scored a league goal in a 4‚Äì2 win over Huddersfield Town on 24 January 2009, his first in four years. He made a total of 32 league appearances, scoring 3 goals to help Leicester secure their promotion as League One champions. Berner was issued the number 15 shirt for the 2009‚Äì10 season, with an aim to reach the Championship play-offs. After Leicester reached sixth in the table by 12 September, it came as no surprise to Berner, who insisted their promising start to the season is no more than they expected. He scored his first goal of the season in a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Preston North End on 26 September. When Berner was absent with injury in December, the club failed to keep a clean sheet for seven matches. It was not until he returned to the first team that Leicester finally kept a clean sheet in a 0‚Äì0 draw against Newcastle United on 30 January 2010. He scored a goal and assisted another in a 3‚Äì0 win over Nottingham Forest on 27 February 2010, helping the club finish the month undefeated. Berner scored a penalty kick in a 4‚Äì3 defeat on penalties to Cardiff City in the Championship play-offs semi- final second leg on 12 May 2010. In the 2010‚Äì11 season, Berner revealed with reluctance the likelihood he would leave the club in the January transfer window due to lack of regular football, having lost his place to loanee Greg Cunningham. He made his first start since October 2010 against Swansea City on 3 January 2011, scoring in a 2‚Äì1 win. Cunningham's loan soon ended due to injury and despite Berner being offered a new contract, he still maintained the possibility of leaving, having received interest from \\"a few Championship clubs\\". He finally signed the one-year contract on 20 January. However, Berner announced his retirement from professional football on 1 March 2012 after failing to make an appearance for the Foxes in the 2011‚Äì12 season. International career Berner made his international debut for Switzerland in a 2‚Äì1 win over Austria on 15 August 2001. He was a participant in the 2004 UEFA European Championship, but was an unused substitute in all three Group B matches. Despite being hopeful of winning his place back in the national team for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Berner was not among the 23 players selected on 11 May 2010. Managerial career =FC Tuggen= Between November 2016 and June 2017, Berner was the first team manager of Swiss club FC Tuggen. =SC Kriens= In June 2017 Berner left FC Tuggen to take up the role of first team manager at Swiss Challenge League club SC Kriens.

He shared the rabbinate of Venice with another famous rabbi, Leone de Modena. Works Luzzatto was educated by some of the most outstanding rabbis of his period. By the age of 22, many of his works were being published and discussed throughout the Jewish community. These works, called responsa, gained him a good deal of popularity; including a rather interesting work that deemed it was acceptable to travel by gondola on Shabbat (a day during which motorized travel is normally forbidden to religious Jews). Another of his important works written in Italian is entitled Socrate, which argues that human reason cannot attain its goals if unaided by divine revelation. Expulsion of Jews During this period there were a great many Jews who were being expelled from their homes throughout Italy (and, indeed, the rest of Europe). Fearing the same fate might befall Venetian Jewry, Luzzatto took preemptive action, writing a pamphlet in classical Socratic style which presented clear and rational arguments against such an expulsion taking place in Venice. =Discourse= The resulting work, entitled Discorso circa il stato de gl'Hebrei et in particolar dimoranti nell'inclita citt√† di Venetia (\\"Discourse Concerning the Condition of the Jews, and in particular those living in the Fair City of Venice\\"), was completed in 1638. The discourse broke from tradition in that it was not directly addressed to Venetian Jewry or the official rabbinate of the time, but to the leaders of the Venetian Republic (called the doge, amongst others). Luzzatto argued for toleration of the Jews on the basis of their economic and social usefulness. He stated that Jews performed tasks which would normally be taken on by foreign merchants, but could instead remain under control of the republic. Further breaking from tradition, the discourse was not written in Hebrew, but rather in eloquent Italian. As a result, the discourse was successful in convincing the Doge to rule against the expulsion edict, allowing the Jewish population of Venice to remain.

It is made during Holy Week and then brought to Church on Great Saturday to be blessed after the Paschal Vigil. The name of the dish comes from Pascha, the Eastern Orthodox celebration of Easter. Besides Russia, Ukraine, etc., pasha is also often served in Finland. Cheese paskha is a traditional Easter dish made from quark (curd cheese, ), which is white, symbolizing the purity of Christ, the Paschal Lamb, and the joy of the Resurrection. It is formed in a mould, traditionally in the shape of a truncated pyramid (a symbol of the Church; this form is also said to represent the Tomb of Christ). It is usually served as an accompaniment to rich Easter breads called paska in Ukraine and kulich in Russia (where the \\"paskha\\" name is also used in the Southern regions). The pascha is decorated with traditional religious symbols, such as the \\"Chi Ro\\" motif, a three-bar cross, and the letters X and B (Cyrillic letters which stands for –•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–æ—Å—ä –í–æ—Å–∫—Ä–µ—Å–µ. This is the Slavonic form of the traditional Paschal greeting: \\"Christ is Risen!\\"). All of these religious decorations symbolize Christ's Passion and Resurrection.  Preparation  A paskha mould In addition to the main ingredient (tvorog), additional ingredients, such as butter, eggs, smetana (sour cream), raisin, almonds, vanilla, spices, and candied fruits can be used. The paskha can either be cooked or uncooked (raw). Cooked paskha is made in the form of an egg custard, to which the remaining ingredients are folded in. An uncooked paskha is made simply of the raw curd and the other ingredients mixed at room temperature. Since uncooked curd cannot be conserved for a long period of time, these paskhas are typically made smaller. The tvorog is first pressed in order to eliminate the maximum amount of liquid possible, then put twice through a sieve to make a homogeneous mass. If the paskha is cooked, this mass is then heated. The pan containing the mixture is then placed in a container of cold water and progressively cooled. Afterward, it is placed in a traditional wooden mould assembly called pasochnitsa (–ø–∞—Å–æ—á–Ω–∏—Ü–∞), with a layer of cheese cloth protecting the mould. The wooden mould can be taken apart for cleaning; however, more modern materials, such as plastics, are used nowadays. The mould is cooled for twelve hours in a cold, but not freezing place (typically in a cellar or refrigerator). Finally, the paskha is turned out of the mould, the cheesecloth removed, and put on a dish. It may then be decorated with candied fruits, nuts, or flowers. In contemporary times, cheese paska is not always formed in a mould and is sometimes served in a mound on a plate. The paskha (or at least a portion of it) will be placed in an Easter basket together with other festal foods, and taken to church to be blessed.

The family is closely related to the Eucharitidae, and the eucharitids appear to have evolved from within the Perilampidae, thus rendering the family paraphyletic (if the two families are joined in the future, the name with precedence is Eucharitidae).

He was called 'The White Earl' and was esteemed for his learning. He was the patron of the Irish literary work, 'The Book of the White Earl'. His career was marked by his long and bitter feud with the Talbot family. Family James Butler was the second but eldest surviving son of James Butler, 3rd Earl of Ormond, and his first wife Anne Welles, daughter of John de Welles, 4th Baron Welles by Maude de Ros, daughter of William de Ros, 2nd Baron de Ros of Helmsley. Career Ireland in 1450 showing the Earldom of Ormond. He prevailed upon Henry V to create a King of Arms in Ireland, with the title of Ireland King of Arms (altered by Edward VI to Ulster King of Arms), and he gave lands in perpetuity to the College of Heralds, London. He was appointed Lord Deputy of Ireland in 1405, and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1420, 1425, and 1442. He appointed James FitzGerald, 6th Earl of Desmond as Seneschal of Imokilly in 1420. =The Butler‚ÄìTalbot feud= His term as Lord Lieutenant was marked by his bitter feud with the Talbot family, headed by John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury and his brother Richard, Archbishop of Dublin. The dispute reached its height in 1442 when Archbishop Talbot, supposedly acting on behalf of the Irish Parliament, presented the Privy Council with a long list of grievances against Ormonde, who was accused of being old and feeble (in fact he was only fifty, which was not considered a great age even in the fifteenth century), and of having lost most of his Irish estates through negligence; there were also vague references to treason and \\"other crimes which could not be named\\".O'Flanagan, J. Roderick Lives of the Lord Chancellors of Ireland London 1870 The Council summoned Ormonde to account for his actions: he defended himself vigorously, and made detailed counter-charges against the Archbishop. The Council took no action against him. Instead it rebuked both sides to the dispute severely for disrupting the good governance of Ireland. The feud gradually cooled off, and friendly relations between the two families were finally established by the marriage of Ormonde's daughter Elizabeth to Shrewsbury's son and heir John.Otway-Ruthven, J.A. History of Mediaeval Ireland Barnes and Noble 1993 =Later years= Ormonde remained an influential figure in Irish politics, although his later years were troubled by fresh quarrels with the Earl of Desmond, with Giles Thorndon, the Treasurer of Ireland, with Thomas Fitzgerald, Prior of the Knights Hospitaller at Kilmainham, and with Richard Wogan, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland. Wogan in particular complained that he was no longer able to endure the burden of Ormonde's \\"heavy lordship\\" and asked to be allowed to deputise his duties.Otway-Ruthven Relations between Ormonde and Prior Fitzgerald became so bad that in 1444 it was seriously suggested that they settle the matter through trial by combat, but King Henry VI intervened personally to persuade them to make peace.Burton, Rev. Nathaniel History of the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, from the Original Foundation to the Present Time William Curry and Co. Dublin 1843 pp.92-93 In 1440 Ormonde had a grant of the temporalities of the See of Cashel for ten years, following the death of the Archbishop of Cashel, Richard O'Hedian. He built the castles of Nenagh, Roscrea and Templemore in north County Tipperary and Tulleophelim (or Tullowphelim) in County Carlow. He gave the manor and advowson of Hickcote in Buckinghamshire to the Hospital of St Thomas of Acre in London, which was confirmed by the Parliament of England (in the third year of Henry VI) at the suit of his son.Lodge, John The Peerage of Ireland or, A Genealogical History Of The Present Nobility Of That Kingdom, 1789, Vol IV, p 11. Since his father- in-law had no surviving son, Ormond, in right of his second wife Elizabeth, claimed possession of the Earldom of Kildare, and for some years he was able to keep the legitimate heir out of his inheritance. He died in Dublin on 23 August 1452 on his return from an expedition against Connor O'Mulrian, and was buried in St. Mary's Abbey near Dublin. Marriage and Children He married firstly, in 1413, Joan Beauchamp (1396‚Äì1430), the daughter of William de Beauchamp, 1st Baron Bergavenny and Joan Arundel, by whom he had three sons and two daughters: *James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond, who died without any legitimate children. *John Butler, 6th Earl of Ormond, who died without any legitimate children. *Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond. *Elizabeth Butler, who married John Talbot, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury. *Anne Butler, who died unmarried. He married secondly, by licence dated 18 July 1432, Elizabeth FitzGerald (c. 13986 August 1452), widow of John Grey, 2nd Baron Grey of Codnor (died 14 September 1430), and daughter of Gerald FitzGerald, 5th Earl of Kildare and his second wife Agnes Darcy, by whom he had no children.

A precursor of pizza was probably the focaccia, a flat bread known to the Romans as , to which toppings were then added. Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century. The word pizza was first documented in A.D. 997 in GaetaSalvatore Riciniello (1987) Codice Diplomatico Gaetano, Vol. I, La Poligrafica and successively in different parts of Central and Southern Italy. Pizza was mainly eaten in Italy and by emigrants from there. This changed after World War II when Allied troops stationed in Italy came to enjoy pizza along with other Italian foods. Origins In Sardinia, French and Italian archaeologists have found bread baked over 7,000 years ago. According to Philippe Marinval, the local islanders leavened this bread. Foods similar to pizza have been made since antiquity. Records of people adding other ingredients to bread to make it more flavorful can be found throughout ancient history. * In the 6th century BC, Persian soldiers serving under Darius the Great baked flatbreads with cheese and dates on top of their battle shields.\\"Pizza, A Slice of American History\\" Liz Barrett (2014), p.13\\"The Science of Bakery Products\\" W. P. Edwards (2007), p.199 * In Ancient Greece, citizens made a flat bread called plakous (œÄŒªŒ±Œ∫Œø·ø¶œÇ, gen. œÄŒªŒ±Œ∫Œø·ø¶ŒΩœÑŒøœÇ‚Äîplakountos)Plakous, Liddell and Scott, \\"A Greek-English Lexicon\\", at Perseus which was flavored with toppings like herbs, onion, cheese and garlic. * An early reference to a pizza-like food occurs in the Aeneid (ca. 19 BC), when Celaeno, the Harpy queen, foretells that the Trojans would not find peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In Book VII, Aeneas and his men are served a meal that includes round cakes (like pita bread) topped with cooked vegetables. When they eat the bread, they realize that these are the \\"tables\\" prophesied by Celaeno. Some commentators have suggested that the origins of modern pizza can be traced to pizzarelle, which were kosher for Passover cookies eaten by Roman Jews after returning from the synagogue on that holiday, though some also trace its origins to other Italian paschal breads. Abba Eban writes \\"some scholars think [pizza] was first made more than 2000 years ago when Roman soldiers added cheese and olive oil to matzah\\". Other examples of flatbreads that survive to this day from the ancient Mediterranean world are focaccia (which may date back as far as the ancient Etruscans); Manakish in Levant, coca (which has sweet and savory varieties) from Catalonia, Valencia and the Balearic Islands; the Greek Pita; Lepinja in the Balkans; or Piadina in the Romagna part of Emilia-Romagna in Italy. Foods similar to flatbreads in other parts of the world include Chinese bing (a wheat flour-based Chinese food with a flattened or disk-like shape); the Indian paratha (in which fat is incorporated); the Central and South Asian naan (leavened) and roti (unleavened); the Sardinian carasau, spianata, guttiau, pistoccu; and Finnish rieska. Also worth noting is that throughout Europe there are many similar pies based on the idea of covering flat pastry with cheese, meat, vegetables and seasoning such as the Alsatian flammkuchen, German zwiebelkuchen, and French quiche. In 16th-century Naples, a galette flatbread was referred to as a pizza. Known as the dish for poor people, it was sold in the street and was not considered a kitchen recipe for a long time. This was later replaced by oil, tomatoes (after Europeans came into contact with the Americas) or fish. In 1843, Alexandre Dumas described the diversity of pizza toppings. An often recounted story holds that on June 11, 1889, to honour the Queen consort of Italy, Margherita of Savoy, the Neapolitan pizzamaker Raffaele Esposito created the \\"Pizza Margherita\\", a pizza garnished with tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil, to represent the national colours of Italy as on the Flag of Italy. Pizza evolved into a type of bread and tomato dish, often served with cheese. However, until the late 19th or early 20th century, the dish was sweet, not savory, and earlier versions which were savory more resembled the flat breads now known as schiacciata.Alexandra Grigorieva, \\"Naming Authenticity and Regional Italian Cuisine ,\\" in Richard Hosking, ed., Authenticity in the Kitchen: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery 2005 (Prospect Books, 2006): 211‚Äì216. Pellegrino Artusi's classic early-twentieth-century cookbook, La Scienza in cucina e l'Arte di mangiar bene gives three recipes for pizza, all of which are sweet.Pellegrino Artusi, La scienza in cucina e l'Arte di mangiar bene (1911; rpr. Torino: Einaudi, 2001) After the feedback of some readers, Artusi added a typed sheet in the 1911 edition (discovered by food historian Alberto Capatti), bound with the volume, with the recipe of \\"pizza alla napoletana\\": mozzarella, tomatoes, anchovies and mushrooms.Mattozzi, Antonio e Donatella (2016) \\"Pizze, pizzerie e pizzaiuoli a Napoli tra Sette e Ottocento\\" p.35, in Pizza. Una grande tradizione italiana. Bra: Slow Food Publisher However, by 1927, Ada Boni's first edition of il talismano della felicit√† (a well-known Italian cookbook) includes a recipe using tomatoes and mozzarella.Grigorieva, Naming Authenticity,\\" p. 211-212. Innovation The innovation that led to flatbread pizza was the use of tomato as a topping. For some time after the tomato was brought to Europe from the Americas in the 16th century, it was believed by many Europeans to be poisonous, like some other fruits of the Solanaceae (nightshade) family are. However, by the late 18th century, it was common for the poor of the area around Naples to add tomato to their yeast-based flatbread, and so the pizza began. The dish gained popularity, and soon pizza became a tourist attraction as visitors to Naples ventured into the poorer areas of the city to try the local specialty. Antica Pizzeria Port'Alba in Naples, which is widely believed to be the world's first pizzeria According to documents discovered by historian Antonio Mattozzi in State Archive of Naples, in 1807 already 54 pizzerias existed, with their owners and addresses.Mattozzi, Antonio (2015) Inventing the Pizzeria: a History of Pizza Making in Naples, Bloomsbury Academic, pp.16‚Äì17 In the second half of the nineteenth century they increased to 120.Mattozzi, Antonio Inventing the Pizzeria, Distribution Maps, p.xxxiv In Naples, two others figures connected to the trade existed ‚Äî the pizza hawker (pizzaiuolo ambulante), who sold pizza, but did not make it, and the seller of pizza \\"a oggi a otto\\", who made pizzas, but sold them in return for a payment for seven days.Mattozzi, Antonio Inventing the Pizzeria, p.28 The pizza marinara method has a topping of tomato, oregano, garlic, and extra virgin olive oil. It is named \\"marinara\\" because it was traditionally the food prepared by \\"la marinara\\", the seaman's wife, for her seafaring husband when he returned from fishing trips in the Bay of Naples. The margherita is topped with modest amounts of tomato sauce, mozzarella, and fresh basil. It is widely attributed to baker Raffaele Esposito, who worked at the restaurant \\"Pietro... e basta cos√¨\\" (\\"Pietro... and that's enough\\"), established in 1880 and still in business as \\"Pizzeria Brandi\\". Though recent research casts doubt on this legend, the tale holds that, in 1889, he baked three different pizzas for the visit of King Umberto I and Queen Margherita of Savoy. The Queen's favorite was a pizza evoking the colors of the Italian flag ‚Äî green (basil leaves), white (mozzarella), and red (tomatoes). According to the tale, this combination was named Pizza Margherita in her honor. Although those were the most preferred, today there are many variations of pizzas. \\"Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana\\" (\\"True Neapolitan Pizza Association\\"), which was founded in 1984, has set the very specific rules that must be followed for an authentic Neapolitan pizza. These include that the pizza must be baked in a wood-fired, domed oven; that the base must be hand-kneaded and must not be rolled with a pin or prepared by any mechanical means (i pizzaioli ‚Äî the pizza makers ‚Äî make the pizza by rolling it with their fingers) and that the pizza must not exceed 35 centimetres in diameter or be more than one-third of a centimetre thick at the centre. The association also selects pizzerias all around the world to produce and spread the verace pizza napoletana philosophy and method. There are many famous pizzerias in Naples where these traditional pizzas can be found such as Da Michele, Port'Alba, Brandi, Di Matteo, Sorbillo, Trianon, and Umberto. Most of them are in the ancient historical center of Naples. These pizzerias follow even stricter standards than the specified rules by, for example, using only San Marzano tomatoes grown on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius and drizzling the olive oil and adding tomato topping in only a clockwise direction. The pizza bases in Naples are soft and pliable. In Rome, they prefer a thin and crispy base. Another popular form of pizza in Italy is \\"pizza al taglio\\", which is pizza baked in rectangular trays with a wide variety of toppings and sold by weight. In 1962, the \\"Hawaiian\\" pizza, a pizza topped with pineapple and ham, was invented in Canada by restaurateur Sam Panopoulis at the Satellite Restaurant in Chatham, Ontario. In December 2009, the pizza napoletana was granted Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status by the European Union. In 2012, the world's largest pizza was made in Rome and it was measured to be 1261.65 square metres in area. From the given area, the circular pizza had a diameter of approximately 40.08 m, or 131.5 ft. In 2016, robotics company BeeHex, widely covered in the media, was building robots that 3D-printed pizza. In December 2017, the pizza napoletana was inscribed on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists. Pizza in Canada Canada's first pizzeria opened in 1948, Pizzeria Napoletana in Montreal. Starting in the late 1950s, the first pizza ovens started entering the country. It gained popularity throughout the 1960s, with many pizzerias and restaurants opening across the country. Pizza was mostly served in restaurants and small pizzerias. Most pizza restaurants across Canada also serve popular Italian cuisine in addition to pizza, such as pasta, salad, soups and sandwiches. Fast-food pizza chains also provide other side options for customers to choose from, in addition to ordering pizza, including chicken wings, fries and poutine, salad, and calzones. Pizza Pops are a Canadian calzone-type snack introduced in the 1960s. Pizza chains across Canada can be found in shopping centres, schools, and neighbourhood plazas, with the majority of these chains offering a sit-and-dine facility for customers. The most distinct pizza in Canada is the \\"Canadian\\" pizza. A \\"Canadian\\" pizza is usually prepared with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, and bacon. Many variations of this pizza exist, but the two standout ingredients that make this pizza distinctly Canadian are bacon and mushrooms. Pizzas in Canada are almost never served with \\"Canadian bacon\\", or back bacon as it's referred to in Canada. Rather, side bacon is the standard pork topping on pizza. In the province of Quebec Pizza-ghetti is a combination meal commonly found in fast food or family restaurants. It consists of a pizza, sliced in half, accompanied by a small portion of spaghetti with a tomato based sauce. Although both pizza and spaghetti are considered staples of Italian cuisine, combining them in one dish is completely unknown in Italy. A popular variant involves using spaghetti as a pizza topping, under the pizza's mozzarella cheese Some of Canada's successful pizza brands include: Boston Pizza, Pizza Pizza, and Vanelli's. Boston Pizza, also known as BP's in Canada, and \\"Boston's‚Äîthe Gourmet Pizza\\" in the United States and Mexico, is one of Canada's largest franchising restaurants. The brand has opened over 325 locations across Canada and 50 locations in Mexico and the US. The first Boston Pizza location was opened in Edmonton, Alberta, in 1964, and operated under the name \\"Boston Pizza & Spaghetti House\\", with locations still opening across the nation. Pizza Pizza, and its subsidiary chain Pizza 73 in Western Canada, are among Canada's largest domestic brands based in Ontario. To date, they have over 500 locations nationwide, and fill more than 29 million orders annually. Vanelli's is an international pizza chain that is based in Mississauga. The chain first opened in 1981, serving both pizza and other fresh Italian cuisine, such as pasta and Italian sandwiches. In 1995, the brand opened its first international location in Bahrain and became an international success. The brand continued to open additional locations across the Middle East, with chains now opened in the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, and Morocco. There are over 110 locations worldwide; making Vanelli's the first pizza brand in Canada to open locations internationally. With pizza gaining popularity across the nation, major American pizza chains such as Pizza Hut, Domino's Pizza and Little Caesars have expanded their locations in Canada, competing against the domestic Canadian brands. The major American pizza chains have brought their signature classic pizza recipes and toppings into their Canadian chains, offering their traditional classic pizzas to Canadian customers. However, the American chains have also created Canadian specialty pizzas that are available only in Canada. Pizza in the United States A pizza pie. In the background is a calzone Pizza with roast chicken Pizza first made its appearance in the United States with the arrival of Italian immigrants in the late 19th century and was popular among large Italian populations in New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, Trenton and Saint Louis. According to a 2009 response published in a column on Serious Eats, the first printed reference to \\"pizza\\" served in the US is a 1904 article in The Boston Journal. Giovanni and Gennaro Bruno came to America from Naples, Italy, in 1903 and introduced the Neapolitan pizza to Boston. Later, Vincent Bruno (Giovanni's son) went on to open the first pizzeria in Chicago. Conflicting stories have the first pizzeria opening in 1905 when Gennaro Lombardi applied for a license in New York to make and sell pizza. One of the generally accepted first US business to sell pizza, Lombardi's, opened in 1897 as a grocery store at 53¬Ω Spring Street, with tomato pies wrapped in paper and tied with a string at lunchtime to workers from the area's factories. In 1905, putative founder Gennaro Lombardi received a business license to operate a pizzeria restaurant, and soon had a clientele that included Italian tenor Enrico Caruso. He later passed the business on to his son, George. Pizza was brought to the Trenton area of New Jersey with Joe's Tomato Pies opening in 1910, followed soon by Papa's Tomato Pies in 1912. In 1936, De Lorenzo's Tomato Pies was opened. While Joe's Tomato Pies has closed, both Papa's and Delorenzo's have been run by the same families since their openings and remain among the most popular pizzas in the area. Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana in New Haven, Connecticut, was another early pizzeria which opened in 1925 (after the owner served pies from local carts and bakeries for 20‚Äì25 years) and is famous for its New Haven‚Äìstyle Clam Pie. Frank Pepe's nephew Sal Consiglio opened a competing store, Sally's Apizza, on the other end of the block, in 1938. Both establishments are still run by descendants of the original family. When Sal died, over 2,000 people attended his wake, and The New York Times ran a half-page memoriam. The D'Amore family introduced pizza to Los Angeles in 1939. Before the 1940s, pizza consumption was limited mostly to Italian immigrants and their descendants. Following World War II, veterans returning from the Italian Campaign, who were introduced to Italy's native cuisine proved a ready market for pizza in particular, touted by \\"veterans ranging from the lowliest private to Dwight D. Eisenhower\\". By the 1960s, it was popular enough to be featured in an episode of Popeye the Sailor. Pizza consumption has exploded in the U.S with the introduction of Pizza chains such as Domino's, Pizza Hut, and Papa John's. Two entrepreneurs, Ike Sewell and Ric Riccardo, invented Chicago-style deep-dish pizza, in 1943. They opened their own restaurant on the corner of Wabash and Ohio, Pizzeria Uno. Pizza chains sprang up with pizza's popularity rising. Leading early pizza chains were Shakey's Pizza, founded in 1954 in Sacramento, California; Pizza Hut, founded in 1958 in Wichita, Kansas; and Little Caesars, founded in 1959 in Garden City, Michigan. Later restaurant chains in the dine-in pizza market were Bertucci's, Happy Joe's, Monical's Pizza, California Pizza Kitchen, Godfather's Pizza, and Round Table Pizza, as well as Domino's, Pizza Hut, Little Caesars and Papa John's. Pizzas from take and bake pizzerias, and chilled or frozen pizzas from supermarkets make pizza readily available nationwide. 13% of the US population consumes pizza on any given day.

Background Flora Lewis was born into a Jewish family in Los Angeles. Her father Benjamin Lewis was a lawyer and mother Pauline Kallin a pianist. She graduated high school at the age of 15 and earned a BA from the University of California at Los Angeles graduating summa cum laude three years later. She was also elected to Phi Beta Kappa and received her master's degree from Columbia University's School of Journalism in 1942 just before turning 20. Career In 1942, Lewis joined The Associated Press (AP) in New York and Washington. In 1945, the AP sent her to London, where she married Sydney Gruson, a New York Times correspondent. For the next 20 years, she was based in London, Jerusalem, Prague, Warsaw, Geneva, Bonn, Paris and Mexico City. European publishers included The Observer, The Economist and The Financial Times in London and France-Soir in Paris. From 1956 to 1966 Lewis was a reporter for The Washington Post, where her work landed her on the master list of Nixon political opponents. In 1966, Newsday published and syndicated her first column. In 1972 The New York Times appointed her foreign and diplomatic correspondent. The Times then had a rule against hiring wives of its correspondents, Lewis, however, contributed frequently to The New York Times Magazine and wrote for other publications. She has the distinction of being the first woman to be given her own column on the New York Times op-ed page. Personal and death From 1945 to 1972, Lewis was married to New York Times correspondent, editor, and publishing executive Sydney Gruson. She and Gruson had three children: Kerry (born in Ireland), Sheila (born in Israel), and Lindsey (born in Mexico). Writing for the Jewish Women's Archive, Ari Goldman described her thus: > It was a kosher home where Jewish holidays were observed, one family member > recalled, but Lewis retained little attachment to traditional Jewish life in > her adulthood. In her dispatches she often showed sympathy for Israel, but > also felt free to criticize the Jewish state when she thought its policies > were wrongheaded. She titled a 1990 column on Israel \\"Lament for Jerusalem.\\" > It expressed a sense of disappointment but also of love, especially for the > city‚Äôs longtime mayor, Teddy Kollek (b. 1911). She wrote: \\"If there‚Äôs a > living soul who embodies the city of Jerusalem, it‚Äôs Teddy Kollek. This is a > lament for the city, and for him, because he has made his life's work trying > to revive it, beautify it and bring it harmony.\\" She died of cancer in Paris in 2002. Recognition and awards Lewis received many awards for her journalism including for distinguished diplomatic reporting from Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service. She received honorary doctorates from the University of California at Los Angeles, Columbia, Princeton, Mount Holyoke, Bucknell, Muhlenberg and Manhattan Marymount. She received four awards from the Overseas Press Club: for foreign- affairs reporting (1957), daily newspaper or wire interpretation of foreign affairs (1963, 1977), and analysis of foreign affairs in Western Europe (1979). She also received the Edward Weintal Award (1978); the Cross of the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor, France's highest peacetime award (1981); the Matrix Award for Newspapers from New York Women in Communication (1985), and the Elmer Holmes Bobst Award in Arts and Letters from New York University (1987). Impact For her obituary, the New York Times wrote: > Heads of government and ordinary readers in the United States and Europe, > where she lived for much of her career, looked to Flora Lewis's columns not > only for her access to people in high places, but also for the dogged > reporting and the sophisticated analysis that resulted.

It is subordinate to Aman, the military intelligence directorate. The unit is composed primarily of 18‚Äì21 year olds.

Originally, it was called the 2nd Intelligence Service Unit and then the 515th Intelligence Service Unit. In 1954, the unit moved from Jaffa to its current base at the Glilot junction. According to Peter Roberts, the Director of Military Sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, ‚ÄúUnit 8200 is probably the foremost technical intelligence agency in the world and stands on a par with the NSA in everything except scale. They are highly focused on what they look at ‚Äî certainly more focused than the NSA ‚Äî and they conduct their operations with a degree of tenacity and passion that you don‚Äôt experience elsewhere.‚ÄùUnit 8200: Israel‚Äôs cyber spy agency, Former insiders and whistle-blowers provide a view of the formidable military intelligence outfit JULY 10, 2015 by John Reed, Financial Times Overview Unit 8200 is the largest unit in the Israel Defense Forces, comprising several thousand soldiers. It is comparable in its function to the United States' National Security Agency and is a Ministry of Defense body just as the NSA is part of the United States Department of Defense. Subordinate to Unit 8200 is Unit Hatzav (Hebrew name for Drimia ()), responsible for collecting OSINT intelligence. The unit monitors and collects military intelligence‚Äìrelated information from television, radio, newspapers, and the internet. The translation of various items accounts for part of what is termed \\"basic intelligence\\", which is collected by the units. According to media reports, the unit provides over half of the overall intelligence information for the Israeli Intelligence Community. The IDF's most important signal intelligence‚Äìgathering installation is the Urim SIGINT Base, a part of Unit 8200. Urim is located in the Negev desert approximately 30 km from Beersheba.Le Monde Diplomatique, 2010 September, \\"Israel‚Äôs Omniscient Ears: Israel‚Äôs Urim Base in the Negev Desert is among the most important and powerful intelligence gathering sites in the world. Yet, until now, its eavesdropping has gone entirely unmentioned\\". http://mondediplo.com/2010/09/04israelbase In March 2004, the Commission to investigate the intelligence network following the War in Iraq recommended turning the unit into a civilian national SIGINT agency, as is in other Western countries, but this proposal was not implemented. Unit 8200 is staffed primarily by 18‚Äì21 year old conscripts. Selection and recruitment to the unit usually occurs at age 18 through the IDF screening process after high school. However, the unit also scouts potential younger recruits through after-school computer classes. These after-school computer classes, teaching 16‚Äì18 year olds computer coding and hacking skills, sometimes act as a feeder program for the unit, with students receiving invitation letters from the IDF. The 18 year olds selected for the unit are primarily chosen for their ability to teach themselves and to learn very quickly as the unit will only have access to their services for a short time before their military service period ends.  Political activities  On 11 September 2013, The Guardian released a leaked document provided by Edward Snowden which reveals how Unit 8200, referred to as ISNU, receives raw, unfiltered data of U.S. citizens, as part of a secret agreement with the U.S. National Security Agency In 2010, the French newspaper Le Monde diplomatique wrote that Unit 8200 operates a large SIGINT base in the Negev, one of the largest listening bases in the world, capable of monitoring phone calls, emails, and other communications, throughout the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and Africa, as well as tracking ships. Unit 8200 also reportedly maintains covert listening posts in Israeli embassies abroad, taps undersea cables, maintains covert listening units in the Palestinian territories, and has Gulfstream jets equipped with electronic surveillance equipment. Ronen Bergman says in a 2009 book that a Hezbollah bomb, disguised as a cell phone, was picked up by agents, and taken for investigation to Unit 8200's headquarters in February 1999. Inside the laboratory the cell phone exploded. Two Unit 8200 soldiers were injured.

The city agency was established in 1932 and is appointed by the mayor. The Board of Supervisors must approve its budget.  History The San Francisco Art Commission's Community Arts and Education Program is an offshoot of the Commission's Neighborhood Arts Program, which supported grassroots community arts programs. It was a national trailblazer in nurturing art in places outside the circles of high culture. The program expanded under the direction of Stephen Goldstine. It was during his tenure, from 1970 to '78, that the program tapped into federal money to help fund local artists. An intern named John Kreidler, who had worked in Washington and would later head the philanthropic San Francisco Foundation, hit on the idea of using federal grants from the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, or CETA, to employ a slew of local performers, muralists, musicians, poets, gardeners and other artists to work in schools, community centers, prisons and wherever their skills and services were of value to the community. Inspired by the Works Progress Administration's employment of artists in the service to the community in the 1930s, this program was so successful that it became a model for similar programs throughout the US. The SFAC removed the \\"Early Days\\" sculpture that was a part of the Pioneer Monument in Civic Center, San Francisco in 2018 and the Statue of Christopher Columbus in Pioneer Park in 2020 due to their controversial nature. San Francisco Arts Commission Gallery The San Francisco Arts Commission Gallery is the contemporary art exhibitions program of the Commission. There are three locations for the gallery, with the main gallery located in the San Francisco War Memorial and Performing Arts Center at 401 Van Ness Avenue, in the heart of San Francisco's Civic Center. The other locations are a storefront art gallery at 155 Grove Street, across from City Hall and Art at City Hall. Founded in 1970, the Gallery commissions new works, collaborates with arts and community organizations and supports artist's projects. Admission to the gallery is free. Other programs and functions The art commission has many functions and sponsors many programs. One of its functions is to approve the design of any buildings built by the city. It oversees the selection of \\"art enrichment\\" in the forms of graphics, murals and sculpture for civic buildings and spaces. The commission oversees the city-owned cultural centers - among them the historic Bayview Opera House, the Mission Cultural Center for Latino Arts and the African American Art and Culture Complex. The commission funds arts programs for elders, homeless people in the Tenderloin and kids at risk, as well as the Filipino community's Parol Lantern Festival and other street festivals and events across town. The Community Arts and Education Program supports programs that enrich the fabric of the communities of neighborhood life, giving opportunities for creative and artistic expression for all people. This egalitarian spirit carries on the values of the people who started the program in 1967 of \\"nurturing the arts for and by the people where they live and work.\\" Other Arts Commission programs are an annual city art festival and a pops concert series. The commission's Writer's Corps brings writers into public schools. The Arts Commission maintains a database of public art on its website Public Art Projects List  Public Art & Civic Art Collection  Visual Arts Committee  The Visual Arts Committeehttps://sfgov.org/arts/visual-arts-committee Visual Arts Committee of the SFAC is the governing body responsible for approving new commissions of public art for the City & County of San Francisco. The SFAC's public art program, led by longtime program director Susan Pontious,https://www.sfartscommission.org/our-role-impact/programs/public-art Susan Pontious has achieved an international reputation for its inventive and generous approach to commissioning new works of art, and for enabling artists to experiment with new mediums and materials in their work.https://www.sfgate.com/art/article/Art-installations-soothe-delays-at- SFO-669588php. Although many of the artists commissioned have never created public art before, the public art staff has been able to work with them to translate their works in painting, sculpture, photography, and other media to be scaled up to permanent public artworks that are displayed throughout the city in its parks, public buildings, and the San Francisco International Airport, the only country's airport with a museum program accredited by the American Association of Museums.https://www.sftravel.com/article/art-you-cant- miss-san-francisco-international-airport San Francisco has been recognized with multiple awards by the Americans for the Arts Public Art Network, https://www.americansforthearts.org/by-program/networks-and-councils/public- art-network/pan-year-in-review-database Public Art Network (PAN) the only national award for public art, which every year recognizes the best public artworks created in the country. In 2019, the artist Julie Chang received an award for the work the SFAC commissioned her to create for the TransBay Terminal.https://www.americansforthearts.org/by-program/networks-and- councils/public-art-network/public-art-year-in-review-database/secret-garden PAN award In fall 2019, the SFAC began a selection process for an artist to be commissioned to create a public sculpture to honor the author and civil rights leader Maya Angelou. After soliciting multiple artists and convening a panel to choose three finalists, the selection panel (composed of curators, members of the community, and an Arts Commissioner) determined that three artists‚ÄîKenyatta Hinkle, Lava Thomas, and Jules Arthur‚Äîwho scored highest after this initial assessment would be paid a fee to create a conceptual proposal for the sculpture, which was to be sited in front of the San Francisco Public Library. That same selection panel later convened to determine which proposal was the strongest of the three, and to recommend that the strongest proposal go through the remaining required approval processes, after which that artist could be contracted to make the work. Although artist Lava Thomas received the highest score with the recommending panel, that was only the first of multiple stages of approval that were necessary. Thomas did not actually ever win the commission and was never offered a contract by the SFAC to move forward. Instead, when the SFAC's Visual Arts committee subsequently met on August 21, 2019 for the next stage of the approval process, commission members moved to put the Angelou sculpture commission on hold, pending consideration of concerns over the final proposals being considered for the sculpture commission and modifications that needed to be addressed before moving forward. Subsequent public media coverage of this public art commission wrongly stated that Thomas had actually won the commission and that it had been taken away from her, although artists are informed during the process that any decision by the selection panel is merely advisory, which was reiterated at a subsequent Visual Arts Committee meeting. To correct this misperception and determine next steps, the SFAC convened another meeting at which the main stakeholder actually funding the commission, Supervisor Catherine Stefani, explained that she believed that Ms. Thomas' proposal did not meet the specifications stated in the funding legislation for the kind of \\"monument\\" that had been anticipated to be created. Supervisor Catherine Stefani called for the SFAC to restart the selection process with clearer criteria for a what constituted a monument.https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/proposals-for-statues-to-honor-maya- angelou-meet-with-rejection/ restart the selection process In describing her justification for this decision, Stefani said, according to the San Francisco Examiner: ‚ÄúAs I carried the legislation across the finish line to elevate women in monuments, I wanted to do it in the same way that men have been historically elevated in this city.‚Äù Documentation of the selection process for the Angelou sculpture artwork commission was shared on the SFAC website with an opportunity for public comment as part of the Final Selection Panel meeting. According to Thomas, the call saying that the sponsors preferred a more figurative, traditional design did not align with the design brief applicants were given, in which, Thomas stated, the word \\"statue is crossed out and artwork is replaced.\\" At a meeting with SFAC on October 16, 2019, Thomas stated: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe that we‚Äôre here two months later with a suggestion that this project be closed, and a conservative, traditional statue in the manner of European figurative traditional monuments that confederate and colonial monuments are based on, that we are here discussing this in this city, San Francisco, that‚Äôs known for its progressive politics.‚Äù At a public meeting on July 15, 2020, the Visual Arts Committee met to evaluate the status of the city's public monuments and memorials and determine which currently aligned with the city's values.https://sfgov.org/arts/visual-arts-committee Visual Arts Committee of the San Francisco Arts Commission Thomas attended the meeting and read a statement criticizing the process by which her proposed design was rejected. Although public comment is allowed at all city government meetings, the duration is limited to three minutes (and sometimes two minutes when a lot of members of the public are present), to allow for adequate time for public comment. At this meeting, Thomas was not finished reading her statement when the two minute limit for public comment ended, so she was requested to stop. She was allowed later in the meeting, however, to resume and finish her statement. Realizing that a lack of clarity of certain aspects of the public art selection process had led to confusion regarding this specific commission, the SFAC later apologized to Thomas for its system failures. The SFAC staff and commissioners subsequently conducted multiple meetings, including with Thomas, to determine new procedures and processes, and to facilitate transparency in the process for future public art selection processes and commissions, which procedures and processes were later adopted.https://sfgov.org/arts/sites/default/files/Selection%20Process_ALL.pdf References Further reading * External links *Official San Francisco Arts Commission website *Arts Education *Cultural Equity Grants *Street Artists Program Category:Arts councils of California Category:Art galleries in San Francisco Category:Arts organizations based in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Culture of San Francisco Category:Civic Center, San Francisco Category:Government of San Francisco Category:Government agencies established in 1932 Category:1932 establishments in California ","title":"San Francisco Arts Commission"},{"id":"5659173","text":"Day Old Belgian Blues is a limited edition EP from the American band Kings of Leon, originally recorded at the AB Box in Brussels, Belgium on 4 November 2004.

It is formed by the novellas Iron and Inconstant Star, first published in The Man-Kzin Wars (1988) and Man-Kzin Wars III (1990), respectively. The title is from the tumbling alien artifact that sends out radiation. Due to the tumbling effect, the output can only be seen briefly from a given point in space, looking like a star, but then disappearing as the artifact moves. The title also references another Niven story, \\"Inconstant Moon\\", which is not part of the Known Space series. The novel is the story of Robert Saxtorph and his ship Rover, hired for peaceful missions, but which run into Kzinti at every turn. Plot summary There are two parts to the novel, Iron, and Inconstant Star. In ‚ÄúIron‚Äù, Saxtorph and the Rover, hired by the wealthy Crashlander Laurinda Brozik, set out to explore a newly discovered red dwarf star. When they arrive, they are challenged by a Kzinti warship. Separating the crew onto the shuttles, the Rover is captured and landed on one of the moons. The first shuttle sets on Prima, the first planet, and is held fast by a planet-sized organism that begins dissolving the shuttle. They broadcast for rescue, and are refused help by the Kzin. Meanwhile, helpless to rescue their friends, Robert, Dorcas, and Laurinda make a plan to steal a tug and escape back to friendly space with the news of the Kzin base. Dorcas pilots the tug, and takes out the ship guarding the Rover. Robert and Laurinda land, fight off a Kzinti shuttle, and recover the Rover. They are able to rescue Juan and Carita, and destroy the base with a guided asteroid. In ‚ÄúInconstant Star‚Äù, Saxtorph and crew are hired by Tyra Nordbo to redeem her father's honor, as he was accused of collaboration with the Kzin during their occupation of Wunderland. To do so, they must use notes he had left behind and follow a ship that had left 30 years prior to investigate a concentration of gamma rays. They travel to the coordinates, and find a massive artifact made of an unknown metal. A hole in the spherical artifact is pouring out lethal radiation. As they study it, they learn it is a weapon of the Tnuctip. It is a shell around a ‚Äúcaptured‚Äù black hole, one that had been holed by a meteorite and is thus releasing the Hawking radiation.

The delta covers 20,000 km¬≤ within wetlands of 70,000 km¬≤ formed primarily by sediment deposition. Home to 20 million people and 40 different ethnic groups, this floodplain makes up 7.5% of Nigeria's total land mass. It is the largest wetland and maintains the third-largest drainage basin in Africa. The Delta's environment can be broken down into four ecological zones: coastal barrier islands, mangrove swamp forests, freshwater swamps, and lowland rainforests. This incredibly well-endowed ecosystem contains one of the highest concentrations of biodiversity on the planet, in addition to supporting abundant flora and fauna, arable terrain that can sustain a wide variety of crops, lumber or agricultural trees, and more species of freshwater fish than any ecosystem in West Africa. The region could experience a loss of 40% of its inhabitable terrain in the next thirty years as a result of extensive dam construction in the region. Sadly, the advent of oil production has also negatively impacted the Niger Delta region due to unprecedented oil spillage which has been ongoing for the past 5 decades making the region one of the most polluted in the world. It is estimated that while European union experienced 10 incidence of oil spills in 40 years, Nigeria recorded 9,343 cases within 10 years.Albert,Amaratunga, Haigh (Nov 29,2017) \\"Evaluation of the Impacts of oil spill Disaster on communities and its influence on Restiveness in Niger Delta, Nigeria.\\"The carelessness of the oil industry has also precipitated this situation, which can perhaps be best encapsulated by a 1983 report issued by the NNPC, long before popular unrest surfaced: :We witnessed the slow poisoning of the waters of this country and the destruction of vegetation and agricultural land and good water source by oil spills which occur during petroleum operations. But since the inception of the oil industry in Nigeria, more than fifty years ago, there has been no concerned and effective effort on the part of the government, let alone the oil operators, to control environmental problems associated with the industry'.Vidal, John (2010-05-30). \\"Nigeria's agony dwarfs the Gulf oil spill.

(approximately 220 thousand cubic metres). A UNDP report states that there have been a total of 6,817 oil spills between 1976 and 2001, which account for a loss of three million barrels of oil, of which more than 70% was not recovered. 69% of these spills occurred off-shore, a quarter was in swamps and 6% spilled on land. The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation places the quantity of petroleum jettisoned into the environment yearly at 2,300 cubic metres with an average of 300 individual spills annually. However, because this amount does not take into account \\"minor\\" spills, the World Bank argues that the true quantity of petroleum spilled into the environment could be as much as ten times the officially claimed amount.Perception and Reality: Assessing Priorities for Sustainable Development in the Niger River Delta (Moffat and Linden) The largest individual spills include the blowout of a Texaco offshore station which in 1980 dumped an estimated of crude oil into the Gulf of Guinea and Royal Dutch Shell's Forcados Terminal tank failure which produced a spillage estimated at . In 2010 Baird reported that between 9 million and 13 million barrels have been spilled in the Niger Delta since 1958. One source even calculates that the total amount of petroleum in barrels spilled between 1960 and 1997 is upwards of . =Causes= Oil spills are a common event in Nigeria. Half of all spills occur due to pipeline and tanker accidents (50%), other causes include sabotage (28%) and oil production operations (21%), with 1% of the spills being accounted for by inadequate or non-functional production equipment. Corrosion of pipelines and tankers is the rupturing or leaking of old production infrastructures that often do not receive inspection and maintenance.Dr. P.C. Nwilo & O. T. Badejo: Impacts of Oil spills along the Nigerian coast The Association for Environmental Health and Sciences, 2001 A reason that corrosion accounts for such a high percentage of all spills is that as a result of the small size of the oilfields in the Niger Delta, there is an extensive network of pipelines between the fields, as well as numerous small networks of flowlines‚Äîthe narrow diameter pipes that carry oil from wellheads to flowstations‚Äîallowing many opportunities for leaks. In onshore areas most pipelines and flowlines are laid above ground. Pipelines, which have an estimate life span of about fifteen years, are old and susceptible to corrosion. Many of the pipelines are as old as twenty to twenty-five years. Shell admits that \\"most of the facilities were constructed between the 1960s and early 1980s to the then prevailing standards. SPDC [Shell Petroleum and Development Company] would not build them that way today.‚ÄùShell International Petroleum Company, Developments in Nigeria (London: March 1995) Sabotage is performed primarily through what is known as \\"bunkering\\", whereby the saboteur attempts to tap the pipeline. In the process of extraction sometimes the pipeline is damaged or destroyed. Oil extracted in this manner can often be sold. Sabotage and theft through oil siphoning has become a major issue in the Niger River Delta states as well, contributing to further environmental degradation.Anderson, I: Niger River basin: A Vision for Sustainable Development Pp. 1‚Äì131 The World Bank, 2005 Damaged lines may go unnoticed for days, and repair of the damaged pipes takes even longer. Oil siphoning has become a big business, with the stolen oil quickly making its way onto the black market.Bronwen Manby: The Price of Oil Human Rights Watch. 1999.

Retrieved May 29, 2007 Nigerian regulations of the oil industry are weak and rarely enforced allowing, in essence, the industry to self-regulate. =Consequences= Oil spillage has a major impact on the ecosystem into which it is released and may constitute ecocide. Immense tracts of the mangrove forests, which are especially susceptible to oil (mainly because it is stored in the soil and re-released annually during inundations), have been destroyed. An estimated 5 to 10% of Nigerian mangrove ecosystems have been wiped out either by settlement or oil. The rainforest which previously occupied some 7,400 km¬≤ of land has disappeared as well. Spills in populated areas often spread out over a wide area, destroying crops and aquacultures through contamination of the groundwater and soils. The consumption of dissolved oxygen by bacteria feeding on the spilled hydrocarbons also contributes to the death of fish. In agricultural communities, often a year's supply of food can be destroyed instantaneously. Because of the careless nature of oil operations in the Delta, . People in the affected areas complain about health issues including breathing problems and skin lesions; many have lost basic human rights such as health, access to food, clean water, and an ability to work.\\"Standing Up To Big Oil\\" Making Contact, produced by National Radio Project. December 14, 2010. On January 30, 2013, a Dutch court ruled that Shell is liable for the pollution in the Niger Delta. In January 2015, Shell agreed to pay $80 million to the Ogoniland community of Bodo for two oil spills in 2008 after a court case in London. = Cleanup = In 2011, Nigeria commissioned a report from the United Nations on the impact of oil extraction in the delta area of 'Ogoniland'. The report found severe soil ground and tapwater contamination, destruction of mangroves, and \\"that institutional control measures in place both in the oil industry and the Government were not implemented adequately.\\" The UN concluded it would take over 30 years to reverse the damage. Based on those recommendations, in August 2017 Nigeria launched a $1 billion clean-up and restoration program. In January 2019 engineers first arrived to begin the cleanup. In 2019, the Nigerian government came under scrutiny when a memo from President Muhammadu Buhari's office directed the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to take over the Ogoniland oil wells from Shell \\"and ensure smooth re-entry.\\" NGOs and the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People have protested the proposed action. The federal government of Nigeria through the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation disbursed the sum of $180m as the take off fee for the 21 selected companies out of the 400 companies that bid for the contract. Loss of mangrove forests Vegetation in the Niger River Delta consists of extensive mangrove forests, brackish swamp forests, and rainforests. The large expanses of mangrove forests are estimated to cover approximately 5,000 to 8,580 km¬≤ of land.Nwilo, Peter C., and Olusegun T. Badejo: Impacts And Management of Oil Spill Pollution Along the Nigerian Coastal Areas International Federation of Surveyors, 2007. Retrieved May 20, 2007. Mangroves remain very important to the indigenous people of Nigeria as well as to the various organisms that inhabit these ecosystems. Human impact from poor land management upstream coupled with the constant pollution of petroleum has caused five to ten percent of these mangrove forests to disappear. The volatile, quickly penetrating, and viscous properties of petroleum have wiped out large areas of vegetation. When spills occur close to and within the drainage basin, the hydrologic force of both the river and tides force spilled petroleum to move up into areas of vegetation. Mangrove forests are included in a highly complex trophic system. If oil directly affects any organism within an ecosystem, it can indirectly affect a host of other organisms. These floral communities rely on nutrient cycling, clean water, sunlight, and proper substrates. With ideal conditions they offer habitat structure, and input of energy via photosynthesis to the organisms they interact with. The effects of petroleum spills on mangroves are known to acidify the soils, halt cellular respiration, and starve roots of vital oxygen. An area of mangroves that has been destroyed by petroleum may be susceptible to other problems. These areas may not be suitable for any native plant growth until bacteria and microorganisms can remediate the conditions. A particular species of mangrove, Rhizophora racemosa lives higher in the delta system. As the soils supporting R. racemosa become too toxic, a non-native invasive species of palm, Nypa fruticans, quickly colonizes the area. This invasive species has a shallower root system that destabilizes the banks along the waterways, further affecting sediment distribution lower in the delta system. N. fruticans also impedes navigation and decreases overall biodiversity. In places where N. fruticans has invaded, communities are investigating how the palm can be used by local people.Nipa Palm Utilization Project Nigerian Conservation Foundation, 1996. Retrieved May 21, 2007. The loss of mangrove forests is not only degrading life for plants and animals, but for humans as well. These systems are highly valued by the indigenous people living in the affected areas. Mangrove forests have been a major source of wood for local people. They also are important to a variety of species vital to subsistence practices for local indigenous groups, who unfortunately see little to none of the economic benefits of petroleum. Mangroves also provide essential habitat for rare and endangered species like the manatee and pygmy hippopotamus. Poor policy decisions regarding the allocation of petroleum revenue has caused political unrest in Nigeria.Conditions in the Niger Delta Shell.com. Retrieved March 16, 2014. This clash among governing bodies, oil corporations, and the people of Nigeria has resulted in sabotage to petroleum pipelines, further exacerbating the threat to mangrove forests. The future for mangrove forests and other floral communities is not all negative. Local and outside groups have provided funds and labor to remediate and restore the destroyed mangrove swamps. The federal government of Nigeria established the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) in 2000 which aims to suppress the environmental and ecological impacts petroleum has had in the region. Governmental and nongovernmental organizations have also utilized technology to identify the source and movement of petroleum spills. Depletion of fish populations The fishing industry is an essential part of Nigeria‚Äôs sustainability because it provides much needed protein and nutrients for people, but with the higher demand on fishing, fish populations are declining as they are being depleted faster than they are able to restore their number. Fishing needs to be limited along the Niger River and aquacultures should be created to provide for the growing demand on the fishing industry. Aquaculture allows for fish to be farmed for production and provide more jobs for the local people of Nigeria. Overfishing is not the only impact on marine communities. Climate change, habitat loss, and pollution are all added pressures to these important ecosystems. The banks of the Niger River are desirable and ideal locations for people to settle. The river provides water for drinking, bathing, cleaning, and fishing for both the dinner table and trading to make a profit. As the people have settled along the shores of the rivers and coasts, marine and terrestrial habitats are being lost and ecosystems are being drastically changed. The shoreline along the Niger River is important in maintaining the temperature of the water because the slightest change in water temperature can be fatal to certain marine species. Trees and shrubs provide shade and habitat for marine species, while reducing fluctuation in water temperature.Molles Jr, M.C.: Ecology Concepts and Applications 3rd Edition, Pg. 93‚Äì94. McGraw-Hill Companies Inc, 2005. The Niger River is an important ecosystem that needs to be protected, for it is home to 36 families and nearly 250 species of fish, of which 20 are endemic, meaning they are found nowhere else on Earth.World Wildlife Fund. 2006. Fishing on the Niger River. Retrieved May 10, 2007 from http://www.panda.org/news_facts/multimedia/video/index.cfm?uNewsID=61121 With the loss of habitat and the climate getting warmer, every prevention of temperature increase is necessary to maintain some of the marine environments. Other than restoring habitat, pollution can also be reduced. Problems such as pesticides from agricultural fields could be reduced if a natural pesticide was used, or the fields were moved farther away from the local waterways. Oil pollution can be lowered as well; if spills were reduced then habitat and environmental impacts could be minimized. Oil contamination affects the fish population and affects the farmers that rely on fishing to support their family. By enforcing laws and holding oil companies accountable for their actions the risk of contamination can be greatly reduced. By limiting the devastation caused by disturbances to the marine environment, such as pollution, overfishing, and habitat loss, the productivity and biodiversity of the marine ecosystems would increase. Water hyacinth invasion Water hyacinth is an invasive species that was introduced into Africa as an ornamental plant, and which thrives in polluted environments. Water hyacinth has the capability to completely clog the waterways in which it grows, making it nearly impossible to navigate fishing boats.Fuggle, R.F.: Africa Environment Outlook Lake Victoria: A Case Study of Complex Interrelationships Pg. 75‚Äì85. United Nations Environment Programme, 2004. In recent years it has found its way into the Niger River, choking out both sunlight and oxygen to the marine organisms that live there. When a species such as water hyacinth makes its way into the ecosystem, it competes with native plants for sunlight, diminishing energy resources within the marine environment. With the loss of energy some populations will not be able to survive, or their numbers may drop beyond a point of no return, creating a threatened environment. Added to the loss of energy, water hyacinth also takes up and depletes the water of oxygen which is essential to the livelihood of all marine organisms. Natural gas flaring Nigeria flares more natural gas associated with oil extraction than any other country, with estimates suggesting that of the 3.5 billion cubic feet (100,000,000 m¬≥) of associated gas (AG) produced annually, 2.5 billion cubic feet (70,000,000 m¬≥), or about 70%, is wasted by flaring. This equals about 25% of the UK's total natural gas consumption and is the equivalent to 40% of Africa's gas consumption in 2001. Statistical data associated with gas flaring are notoriously unreliable, but Nigeria may waste US$2 billion per year by flaring associated gas.Media Briefing: Gas flaring in Nigeria Friends of the Earth, 2004.Estimated flared volumes from satellite data World Bank, 2008. Flaring is done as it is costly to separate commercially viable associated gas from the oil. Companies operating in Nigeria also harvest natural gas for commercial purposes but prefer to extract it from deposits where it is found in isolation as non-associated gas. Thus associated gas is burned off to decrease costs. Gas flaring is generally discouraged as it releases toxic components into the atmosphere and contributes to climate change. In western Europe 99% of associated gas is used or re-injected into the ground. Gas flaring in Nigeria began simultaneously with oil extraction in the 1960s by Shell-BP. Alternatives to flaring are gas re-injection or to store it for use as an energy source. If properly stored, the gas could be used for community projects. Gas flaring releases of large amounts of methane, which has a high global warming potential. The methane is accompanied by the other major greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, of which Nigeria was estimated to have emitted more than 34.38 million metric tons of in 2002, accounting for about 50% of all industrial emissions in the country and 30% of the total CO2 emissions. While flaring in the west has been minimized, in Nigeria it has grown proportionally with oil production.Gas flaring in Nigeria: A human rights, environmental and economic monstrosity. Friends of the Earth Nigeria The international community, the Nigerian government, and the oil corporations seem in agreement that gas flaring needs to be curtailed. Efforts to do so, however, have been limited although flaring has been declared illegal since 1984 under section 3 of the \\"Associated Gas Reinjection Act\\" of Nigeria. While OPEC and Shell, the biggest flarer of natural gas in Nigeria, alike claim that only 50% of all associated gas is burnt off via flaring, these data are contested. The World Bank reported in 2004 that, \\"Nigeria currently flares 75% of the gas it produces.\\" Gas flares have potentially harmful effects on the health and livelihood of nearby communities, as they release poisonous chemicals including nitrogen dioxides, sulphur dioxide, volatile organic compounds like benzene, toluene, xylene and hydrogen sulfide, as well as carcinogens like benzapyrene and dioxins. Humans exposed to such substances can suffer from respiratory problems. These chemicals can aggravate asthma, cause breathing difficulties and pain, as well as chronic bronchitis. Benzene, known to be emitted from gas flares in undocumented quantities, is well recognized as a cause for leukemia and other blood-related diseases. A study done by Climate Justice estimates that exposure to benzene would result in eight new cases of cancer yearly in Bayelsa State alone. Gas flares are often close to communities and regularly lack fencing or protection for villagers who risk working near their heat. Many communities claim that nearby flares cause acid rain which corrodes their homes and other structures, many of which have zinc-based roofing. Some people resort to using asbestos-based material, which is stronger in repelling acid rain deterioration.Asbestos: health effects Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 2007. Retrieved May 29, 2007. Unfortunately, this contributes to their declining health and the health of their environment. Asbestos exposure increases the risk of forming lung cancer, pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, and asbestosis.Oil For Nothing: Multinational Corporations, Environmental Destruction, Death and Impunity in the Niger Delta Essential Action, 2000. Retrieved May 10, 2007. Whether or not flares contribute to acid rain is debatable, as some independent studies conducted have found that the sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide content of most flares was insufficient to establish a link between flaring and acid rain. Other studies from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) report that gas flaring is \\"a major contributor to air pollution and acid rain.\\" Older flares are rarely relocated away from villages and are known to coat the land and communities with soot and to damage adjacent vegetation. Almost no vegetation can grow in the area directly surrounding the flares due to their heat. In November 2005 a judgment by the Federal High Court of Nigeria ordered that gas flaring must stop in a Niger Delta community as it violates guaranteed constitutional rights to life and dignity. In a case brought against the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (Shell), Justice C. V. Nwokorie ruled in Benin City that \\"the damaging and wasteful practice of flaring cannot lawfully continue.\\" As of May 2011, Shell had not ceased gas flaring in Nigeria.Nigerian farmer helps put Shell in the dock, Radio Netherlands Worldwide, 2011. Retrieved June 7, 2011.Nigeria Signs Gas Supply Agreements With Shell, Chevron for Power Stations, Bloomberg, 2011. Retrieved June 7, 2011. Biological remediation The use of biological remediation has also been implemented in areas of the delta to detoxify and restore ecosystems damaged by oil spills. Bioremediation involves biological components in the remediation or cleanup of a specific site. A study conducted in Ogbogu located in one of the largest oil producing regions of Nigeria has utilized two plant species to clean up spills. The first stage of cleanup involves Hibiscus cannabinus, a plant species indigenous to West Africa. H. cannabinus is an annual herbaceous plant originally used for pulp production. This species has high rates of absorbency and can be laid down on top of the water to absorb oil. The oil saturated plant material is then removed and sent to a safe location where the hydrocarbons can be broken down and detoxified by microorganisms. The second stage of bioremediation involves a plant known as Vetiveria zizanioides, a perennial grass species. V. zizanioides has a deep fibrous root network that can both tolerate chemicals in the soil and can also detoxify soils through time requiring little maintenance. The people of Ogbogu hope to use these methods of bioremediation to improve the quality of drinking water, soil conditions, and the health of their surrounding environment. However bleak this situation may seem for the Niger Delta region there are clearly alternatives that can be implemented to save it from future contamination. Satellite imagery combined with the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) can be put to work to quickly identify and track spilled oil. To hasten the cleanup of spills, regional cleanup sites along the problem areas could help contain spills more quickly. To make these tasks feasible more funding must be provided by the stakeholders of the oil industry. Nongovernmental organizations will keep fighting the damaging effects of oil, but will not win the battle alone.

It was noted as being the regiment that captured the fleeing President of the Confederate States of America, Jefferson Davis, as the Confederacy collapsed in the spring of 1865. Service The regiment was organized at Detroit, Michigan, and mustered in on August 29, 1862, under the command of Colonel Robert Horatio George Minty of Jackson, Michigan, Lieutenant Colonel of the 3rd Michigan Cavalry Division. Regimental staff included Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Dudley Pritchard of Allegan, Michigan, Major Josiah B. Park of Ovid, Major William H. Dickinson of Grand Rapids, Major Horace Gray of Grosse Ile, Surgeon George W. Fish of Flint, Assistant Surgeon John H. Bacon of Lansing, Adjutant Joseph W. Huston of Paw Paw, Quartermaster Walter C.

Among the men who served in the 4th Michigan Cavalry was James Vernor, Sr., who after the war became a well known pharmacist and the developer of Vernor's Ginger Ale. Another early recruit was future Michigan politician Levi T. Griffin. After training and drilling, it left the state with an enrolment of 1,233 officers and men on September 26, 1862, for duty in Louisville, Kentucky. It saw its first engagement at Stanford Kentucky, fighting the forces of Confederate General John Morgan, attached to the 1st Brigade, Cavalry Division, Army of the Ohio until November 1862. Other assignments during the war included: *1st Brigade, Cavalry Division, Army of the Cumberland, to January, 1863. *1st Brigade, 2nd Cavalry Division, Army of the Cumberland, to October, 1863. *2nd Brigade, 2nd Cavalry Division, Army of the Cumberland, to November, 1863. *1st Brigade, 2nd Cavalry Division, Army of the Cumberland, to November 1864. *1st Brigade, 2nd Division, Wilson's Cavalry Corps, Military Division of Mississippi, to November 1864. *2nd Brigade, 2nd Division, Cavalry Corps, Military Division of Mississippi, to July 1865. The 4th Michigan Cavalry fought alongside the 7th Pennsylvania Cavalry, the 4th United States Cavalry and the Chicago Board of Trade Battery as part of Colonel Minty's Sabre Brigade for much of the war. These units fought at Murfreeboro, Stones River, Shelbyville, Reed's Bridge, Chickamauga, Noonday Creek, Atlanta, Kilpatrick Raid and Selma. The 4th Michigan Cavalry was involved in the capture of Macon, Georgia, on April 20, 1865, along with Col. Henry Harnden and the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry. Subsequently, a detachment of the regiment participated in the pursuit and capture of Jefferson Davis at Irwinville, Georgia, on May 10. Among the troopers credited with playing a key role in identifying and capturing Davis were George Munger and Andrew Bee and [Corporal Baxter B. Bennett] who secured possession of Jeff Davis (Jefferson Davis) spurs. The spurs were kept in his possession for many years until a family member donated them to a museum in Michigan, which transferred the spurs to the Jefferson Davis collection. Also involved in the capture of Davis was Corporal John William Bowles of Company M. The 4th was assigned to routine duty at Macon and then at Nashville, Tennessee, until the end of June. The regiment mustered out on July 1, 1865. Casualties The initial strength of the regiment was 1,233. During its term of service the regiment gained 984 troops, for a total of 2,217 men. Of that number, 3 officers and 48 enlisted men were killed or mortally wounded in battle, and 2 officers and 341 enlisted men perished from disease. George Hiscock was a member of Company B, and the oldest man to enlist at the age of 36. He died on June 23, 1864, from disease, and is buried in Chattanooga, TN.

The outside market has many farmers' stalls, which sell both local and imported produce, as well as two cheese stores, a wine store and a fish store. The market's Art Deco building was designed by architect Ludger Lemieux, working with his son, Paul Lemieux. It is located on Atwater Street, near the Lachine Canal and the Lionel-Groulx Metro station, as well as Greene Avenue. A pedestrian bridge, which can also be used by bicycles, connects the market to Saint-Patrick Street and to a bicycle path in Pointe-Saint-Charles on the other side of the Lachine Canal. The presence of this bridge explains the popularity of this market with bike riders, who often stop there, and contributes to the summer ambiance of the area. The bike path travels from the Old Port of Montreal to the Lachine Marina and is owned and maintained by Parks Canada. The area immediately east and west of the market has enjoyed a rebirth and gentrification, with a number of upscale condominiums being built right on the Lachine Canal and replacing low- and modest-cost housing. Since the Lachine Canal reopened in 2002, residential property values in the Southwest borough have shot up by 61%, according to Montreal's 2006 property valuation roll, with the highest growth happening around the Atwater Market.

Early life and education Childs was born on March 17, 1903, in Clinton, Iowa. He graduated from Lyons High School in Clinton in 1918, and received a B.A. in 1923 and Litt.D. in 1966 from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. After working for United Press in several Midwestern cities (including Chicago) since 1923, he attended the University of Iowa and completed his M.A. in 1925. In 1969, he obtained a second Litt.D. from the University of Iowa. Following his college graduation, Childs worked briefly for United Press. He then returned to the University of Iowa to teach English composition before rejoining United Press, this time in New York. \\"My father,\\" wrote Childs, \\"was a lawyer and his father was a farmer, as his forebears apparently had been since the time of Adam. Why I wanted, from the age of thirteen or fourteen, to be a newspaperman I've never quite understood.\\" Career =Newspaperman= Marquis Childs in 1937 In 1925, Childs rejoined United Press and then in 1926 joined the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, where he would remain off and on until 1944\\"Marquis W. Childs is Dead at 87: Won a Pulitzer for Commentary,\\" New York Times (July 2, 1990)., mostly serving as a feature writer for its American Mercury magazine section. In 1932 Childs wrote an article for Harper's (published in the November issue) that was not so warmly received in his hometown. \\"River Town,\\" a collection of thinly disguised tales of prominent Clinton citizens, was thought by natives to be at best in poor taste, and at worst, outrageous, although it was read by many with glee. (In 1951 Childs partially redeemed himself in the eyes of the offended with an article, \\"The Town I Like‚ÄîClinton, Iowa,\\" which appeared in the May‚ÄìJune issue of the Lincoln-Mercury Times). In 1933 Childs visited Europe, returning to the United States in June 1934 as a member of the Washington staff of the Post-Dispatch. He traveled 15,000 miles with President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the 1936 re-election campaign, and briefly with candidates Alfred M. Landon and Norman Thomas. A Harper's article entitled \\"They Hate Roosevelt!\\" was expanded into a campaign pamphlet and given wide circulation throughout the United States. =Foreign correspondent= Childs took a leave of absence from the Post-Dispatch to attend a housing exposition in Sweden; he remained there to write a series for the newspaper on Sweden's social and economic advances. A pamphlet and two books developed from this experience: Sweden: Where Capitalism is Controlled (1934), Sweden: the Middle Way (1936), and This is Democracy; Collective Bargaining in Scandinavia (1938). With Sweden: the Middle Way, Childs first came to literary prominence. Critics agreed that it showed \\"striking observation, faithful reporting, and vigorous journalism of a high order\\"; President Roosevelt was inspired to send a special commission abroad to study European cooperative systems. Childs's first novel, Washington Calling! (1937), was called \\"unquestionably the most intelligent novel of Washington since Harvey Ferguson's Capitol Hill.\\" That same year Childs traveled to Spain and wrote a series of articles on the Spanish Civil War for the Post-Dispatch. He expressed anti-Franco and pro- Loyalist sentiments. The next country subjected to Childs's appraisal was Mexico. His series on oil expropriation was so controversial that a United States Senate investigation followed. He was chastised on and off the Senate floor by oilman and Senator Joseph F. Guffey of Pennsylvania. Childs sued Guffey for slander, won a full apology on the floor of the Senate, then withdrew the suit. =Wartime and post-war author= In the early 1940s, Childs published several books that won renewed critical acclaim: Toward a Dynamic America with William T. Stone; This Is Your War (\\"succinct and stimulating,\\" said The New York Times); and I Write from Washington. During the spring of 1943, as guest of the Swedish Foreign Office, Childs again visited Sweden and became interested in the role of neutrals in World War II; this led him to investigate conditions in Switzerland, upon which he reported in a Saturday Evening Post article. Relaxation for Childs during the war years came with horseback riding and figure skating‚Äî\\"When you're trying to keep your balance on a backward eight, you can't think about either your own or the world's troubles.\\" He began writing his column Washington Calling in February 1944 and published The Cabin (an autobiographical novel) that year: > \\" 'Some day,' he said, 'I'll ride on trains whenever I want to ... I'll be > important and at small towns people will look in at the window. They'll say, > 'I've seen his picture in the newspapers.' Why he should have this fame was > never clear in the fantasies he created within the still, closed pool of his > mind.\\" During another stint with the Post-Dispatch (1954‚Äì1962), Childs wrote essays for American Heritage and Holiday and published: Ethics in a Business Society, which was translated into Japanese and Portuguese; The Peacemakers, which appeared in foreign language editions in Denmark, Sweden, The Netherlands, and France; The Ragged Edge: The Erosion of Individual Liberties; and best-sellers Eisenhower: Captive Hero and Walter Lippmann and His Times, co-edited with James Reston. Surprisingly, there are two three-act plays, Maud and Madame Minister, among the Childs materials collected by the University of Iowa. =Newspaperman again= In 1944, Childs rejoined his old news agency, the United Press. While at the United Press, the Post-Dispatch continued to carry his United Press work until he returned to the paper full-time in 1954. On November 21, 1947, Childs wrote an essay that exposed the Justice Department's grand jury investigations into Soviet espionage and all but named Elizabeth Bentley as a witness. The grand jury investigations led to congressional testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee by not only Bentley but also Whittaker Chambers during the summer of 1948 (during the presidential campaign season). Childs was a friend of Laurence Duggan, a Soviet spy or Communist fellow traveler as alleged by both Bentley and Chambers; Childs contributed to a private book memorializing Duggan. The years 1954‚Äì1962 were spent as chief correspondent for the Post-Dispatch. In 1962 as a contributing editor to the Post-Dispatch, Childs's column became syndicated in the United States and Canada by United Features Syndicate. The 1963 Britannica Book of the Year includes his article, \\"The New Europe: Unity and the Old Nationalism.\\" He appeared many times on national television, notably \\"Meet the Press,\\" and lectured throughout the United States. He won the 1969 Pulitzer Prize for distinguished commentary (the first such awarded) in 1970. His work also landed him on the master list of Nixon political opponents. Personal Childs pronounced his first name \\"MARK-us.\\" His first marriage on August 26, 1926, was to Anna 'Lue' Prentiss (April 8, 1902 - September, 1968). Their children were Henry Prentiss Childs and Malissa Marquis Childs (pen name \\"Malissa Redfield\\"). After Lue's death, he married Jane Neylan McBaine in August 1969. On March 25, 1976, Childs returned to Clinton, Iowa, his appearance sponsored by funds administered by the Clinton Library Board. He was received with great warmth. At Clinton High School and in press interviews he reminisced about his youth in Clinton. He remembered ice skating on the frozen Mississippi River, the road shows at the Clinton Theatre, the good high school Lyons was, \\"and the people‚ÄîI remember them. They were all characters‚Äîall with their own identities. They weren't rubbed into conformity by modern society.\\" On June 30, 1990, Marquis Childs died at the Children's Hospital of San Francisco in San Francisco, California from cardiovascular disease. He was buried in Oakland Cemetery, Clinton, Iowa. Awards In 1945, Childs received the Sigma Delta Chi Award for \\"sustained insight in national affairs, first hand reporting, and effective writing.\\" In 1951 he garnered the University of Missouri \\"distinguished service in journalism\\" award. That year he delivered the graduation address to a combined Clinton, Iowa, High School- Clinton Community College assembly and, on the same day, to Lyons High School graduates. He spoke on the value of individuality, a recurrent theme in his writing, speeches, and reminiscences. In 1961, Childs received an order of chivalry from King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden, the Nordstj√§rneorden. Childs was awarded the Golden Plate Award from the American Academy of Achievement in 1969. Works In his epilogue to Witness to Power (1975), Childs wrote, > \\"My judgments have been tempered over the years by a growing awareness of > the hazard of power. It may not be literally true that all power corrupts > but the more it is exercised the more likely it is for the individual to > deceive himself into believing that he is infallible. And when it comes to > absolute power we have seen in this grisly century all too many examples of > what that can mean.\\" =Sweden= * Sweden: Where Capitalism is Controlled (1934), John Day: New York. * Sweden: the Middle Way (1936), Yale University Press: New Haven. * This is Democracy: Collective Bargaining in Scandinavia (1938), Yale University Press: New Haven. =USA= * They Hate Roosevelt!

It was originally called Jakobsdal for its owner Jacob De la Gardie, who had it built by architect Hans Jacob Kristler in 1643‚Äì1645 as a country retreat. He later passed on to his son, Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie, from whom it was purchased in 1669 by Queen Hedvig Eleonora of Sweden. The present design is mainly the work of architect Nicodemus Tessin the Elder and dates from the late 17th century.  History  Edsviken in 1865, by Johan Christoffer Boklund, featuring Ulriksdal Palace on its lefthand side. Prince Ulric (1684‚Äì1685) Hedvig Eleonora had grand plans for the palace and renamed it in 1684 Ulriksdal in honor of its intended future owner, her grandson Prince Ulric. The prince, however, died at the age of one and Hedvig Eleonora kept the palace until her death in 1715 when the property was transferred to the crown for King Frederick I's disposal. Several drawings by Nicodemus Tessin the Elder show a stately palace, three storeys high, with a lantern roof, furnished attic, and side wings extending the lakeside fa√ßade. Implementation of Tessin's designs began under Hedvig Eleonora in the 1670s, but was halted around 1690 due to financial problems. When building work eventually resumed by King Frederick I in the 1720s, the palace architect Carl H√•rleman had different ideas than Tessin the Elder. Among the features incorporated by H√•rleman was one of the first mansard roofs in Sweden. In the mid-18th century, the palace was occupied by King Adolf Frederick and Queen Louisa Ulrika. The Queen set up a theatre here, today called the Confidencen. During the reign of Adolf Frederick and his son Gustav III of Sweden (r. 1771‚Äì1792), it was one of the main residences of the royal court and the place for a grand court life. From 1792 until 1813, it served as residence for the queen dowager of Gustav III, Sophia Magdalena of Denmark.Gerd Ribbing (1959). Ensam drottning. Sofia Magdalena 1783‚Äì1813. [Lonely Queen. Sophia Magdalena 1782‚Äì1813] Stockholm: Alb. Bonniers Boktryckeri. ISBN (Swedish) After her death, the palace was uninhabited until 1821. Relatively little survives of the 18th century interiors, since Ulriksdal served as a veterans' hospital from 1822 to 1849. The hospital was established by King Charles XIV John for veterans of the Russo-Swedish War of 1808‚Äì1809. The palace was therefore almost empty when it was acquired in 1856 by Prince Charles, later King Charles XV. During the reign of Charles XV (r. 1859‚Äì1872), the palace was used as his preferred summer residence. With the aid of architect Fredrik Wilhelm Scholander and through extensive purchases of antiques, Prince Charles was able to design and furnish the palace at his own taste. Many of these furnishings are still on display. During the reign of King Oscar II (1872‚Äì1907), it was often used by Queen Sophia as her personal summer residence: it also served as her residence as a widow until her death in 1913. In 1923, Prince Gustav Adolf, the future King Gustaf VI Adolf married Louise Mountbatten. Ulriksdal became closely associated with the royal couple. During their time, the former knights' hall was turned into a living room with furniture designed by designer Carl Malmsten. The palace has been open to the public since 1986. The original furnishings have been relocated to the preserved rooms and parts of the former living quarters are used to exhibit items from Gustaf VI Adolf's art and crafts collection as well as Gustaf V's silver collection.  Outbuildings  The Palace seen from the Edsviken in January 2007. The Palace Theatre, Confidencen, is situated in a building from the 1670s which was originally used as a horse riding house and later a guesthouse. In 1753, Queen Louisa Ulrika commissioned architect Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz to convert the building into a theatre. It was built in Rococo style, seats 200 spectators and has a table √† confidence, a table which can be lowered through the floor to the basement to be set. Today Confidencen is the oldest Rococo theatre in Sweden, reopened in 1981 and run since then by Kjerstin Dellert. Ulriksdal Palace had in the palace's northern wing originally a chapel, built in 1662 by architect Jean de la Vall√©e. The chapel was torn down during Gustav III's renovation of the palace in 1774. The present chapel was designed by architect Fredrik Wilhelm Scholander and was built in 1864‚Äì1865 in the Palace garden, in Dutch new Renaissance style with a certain influences from Venice. Next to the palace is the greenhouse, today the Orangery Museum. The Orangery was built at the end of the 17th century by architect Nicodemus Tessin the Younger. Despite a number of later changes, Tessin's architecture still dominates the Orangery, which houses parts of the National Museum's sculpture collection, including works by the sculptors Johan Tobias Sergel, Carl Milles and Johan Niclas Bystr√∂m. In 2005 the Orangery inspired the design of the music pavilion at St√•lboga.

Early life and career Mark Red Laffoley was born on 19 May 1958 at Barnet General Hospital, at Chipping Barnet in the County of Hertfordshire.Chipping Barnet was in Hertfordshire until 1965 when it was incorporated into the Borough of Barnet, Greater London. He received his formal education at Christchurch (Church of England) Secondary School in North Finchley. He began playing drums as a teenager, being influenced by England's 1960's Mod fashion and music movement and the work of Keith Moon.Interview with Bob Derwood Andrews, 'Death or Glory' YouTube series with Casey Chaos, Episode No.7, Rockerrazzi Films, 2015. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWcT3k-V35s After a failed audition for The Clash (he was one of two drummers to get a call back), his first drumming role was with Subway Sect, sharing the bill with the Sex Pistols, The Clash, and Siouxsie and the Banshees for the Anarchy and White Riot tours, however he left the band shortly afterwards. Generation X In April 1977 the 18 year old Laff was recruited as a replacement drummer into the upcoming punk rock band Generation X a few months before it signed to Chrysalis Records and released its first single, Your Generation. He was Generation X's drummer through its two long-players, the self-titled Generation X (1978), followed by Valley of the Dolls (1979); which saw the band amidst a heavy performance schedule across Great Britain gaining momentum, drawing recognition and impacting the British pop music charts with its releases. However, after the relative commercial failure of the Valley of the Dolls long-player, internal disagreements about the band's musical direction and personality clashes within it came to a head in late 1979 during the recording of its abortive third long-player (which would be released retrospectively 20 years later under the title K.M.D. - Sweet Revenge). Lead guitarist Bob \\"Derwood\\" Andrews quit the band in December 1979, followed by Laff in January 1980, when he was asked to leave after a disagreement with the act's frontman/singer Billy Idol and bass player Tony James over song-writing credits for the band's recorded work.Interview with Mark Laff, 'Mudkiss Fanzine', 2012. With Laff and Andrews' departure Generation X essentially came to an end; a re-branded act with a replacement guitarist and drummer subsequently launched by Idol and James went on to fail commercially, and was gone by early 1981. Empire After leaving Generation X Laff and Andrews played together as session musicians on Jimmy Pursey's solo long-player, Imagination Camouflage. In mid-1980 they set up a new band entitled Empire,Website detailing the career of the band 'Empire', http://www.empire-expensivesound.blogspot.co.uk recruiting bassist Simon Bernal to complete the line-up. A single entitled Hot Seat was released, followed by a musically influential but commercially unsuccessful album entitled Expensive Sound. The trio undertook four gigs before Bernal left. After a number of line-up changes of personnel and more concerts, but little commercial success, Laff left Empire's line-up in February 1983, and band was ended by Andrews in 1984. Twenty Flight Rockers In 1985 Laff founded a new retro rock & roll/rockabilly band called Twenty Flight Rockers with the singer/frontman Gary Twinn. The band released via ABC Records the single 'Tower Block Rock' (1985) (ranked #31 for Best Single of that year by Rockerilla Magazine, but making no impact on the U.K. Singles' Chart), and another single entitled 'Johnny 7' via WEA Records in 1986, which was also a commercial failure. In March 1986 the band released the song 'Searching for a Hero' in cassette format on a compilation L.P. advertising new bands entitled Spools Gold, given away free with the Record Mirror. Bernie Rhodes, who Laff knew back from his early days with Subway Sect was hired to manage them, and arranged the signing of the band with Epic Records. The band recorded a series of sessions, and a self-produced studio album entitled Ride, which was scheduled for commercial release in 1988, however Epic Records in the meantime was bought out by Sony, which subsequently opted to drop the band from the label, leading to Twenty Flight Rockers breaking up. The Ride L.P. would not see the light of day until 2001 when it was put out by Revel Yell Music as a retrospective release under the title Twenty Flight Rockers. In 2004 'Revel Yell' released a second retrospective L.P. from the band entitled Twenty Flight Rockers - The New York Sessions 1988.Entry in the Discogs database: https://www.discogs.com/artist/853716-Twenty-Flight-Rockers Later career On 20 September 1993, during Billy Idol's No Religion tour, Mark Laff played with a re-formed Generation X in a reunion concert at the Astoria Theatre in London's West End. In 2006 Laff re-recorded the song 'Hot Seat' with Derwood Andrews to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the release of Empire's Expensive Sound L.P., which was re-released on the Expansive Sound Volume II compilation L.P. Laff briefly reunited with Vic Godard in 2007 to re-record Subway Sect's previously unreleased debut album under the title 1978 Now. In 2019 he joined the touring lineup of LAMF, a band fronted by Walter Lure of The Heartbreakers which also featured Mick Rossi, former guitarist of Slaughter & The Dogs. This band played several gigs, including an appearance at the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool. Post-music career Laff retired from professional music in 2004, and went into business as the director of a holistic lifestyle therapy company in Brighton in East Sussex.Interview with Mark Laff, 'Mudkiss Fanzine' (2012) http://www.mudkiss.com/marklaffinterview.htm.

It was fought between Union Major General Nathaniel Prentice Banks against Confederate Major General Richard Taylor during Banks‚Äôs operations against the Bayou Teche region near Franklin, the seat of St. Mary Parish in southern Louisiana. Prelude While the other two Union XIX Corps divisions under Nathaniel Prentice Banks were comprising the expedition into west Louisiana crossed Berwick Bay towards Fort Bisland, Brigadier General Cuvier Grover‚Äôs division went up the Atchafalaya River into Grand Lake, where they could either block a Confederate retreat, or force a retreat if the Confederates stayed and fought at Fort Bisland. The battle occurred two days after the Battle of Fort Bisland. Battle Map of the Battle of Irish Bend Map of Irish Bend Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. On the morning of April 13, 1863, Grover‚Äôs division landed in the vicinity of Franklin and scattered Confederate troops attempting to stop them from disembarking. That night Grover ordered the division to cross Bayou Teche and prepare for an attack towards Franklin, Louisiana, at dawn. Meanwhile, however, Major General Richard Taylor reacted, feeling the obvious threat to his rear. He started withdrawing his forces from Fort Bisland, and his advance guard arrived quickly. On the morning of April 14, Taylor and his men were at Nerson‚Äôs Woods, around a mile and a half above Franklin. As Grover‚Äôs lead brigade marched out a few miles, it found Taylor‚Äôs men on its right and skirmishing began. The fighting became intense; the Confederates attacked, forcing the Federal soldiers to fall back. The gunboat Diana arrived and anchored the Confederate right flank on the Teche. Still, Grover‚Äôs men outnumbered the Confederates and when he paused to deploy his full force, Taylor withdrew rather than risk a pitched battle against superior numbers. Grover‚Äôs men had taken the strategic position they sought. This victory, along with the one at Fort Bisland, two days earlier, assured the success of the expedition into west Louisiana.

It belongs to a Triassic group of temnospondyls called Capitosauria, characterized by their large body size and presumably aquatic lifestyles. Description A reconstruction of Mastodonsaurus with tusks Like those of many other capitosaurs, the head of Mastodonsaurus was triangular, reaching about in the largest specimens. The total length of the largest individuals is about . The large, oval eye sockets are midway along the skull. The jaws are lined with conical teeth. Two large tusks project up from the end of the lower jaw, fitting through openings on the palate and emerging out from the top of the skull when the jaw is closed. A late 19th century illustration of Mastodonsaurus and Hyperodapedon The body of Mastodonsaurus is relatively small in proportion to the large head, and the tail is relatively short. The greatly reduced limb bones have joints that are poorly developed. Biology Fossil remains of M. giganteus at the Muschelkalkmuseum The marked reduction of the limbs and grooves on the head called sensory sulci show that Mastodonsaurus was an aquatic animal that rarely left water. Mastodonsaurus may have been completely unable to leave the water, as large quantities of bones have been found that suggest individuals died en masse when pools dried up during times of drought. It inhabited swampy pools and lived mainly on fish, whose remains have been found in its fossilized coprolites.Benes, Josef. Prehistoric Animals and Plants. Prague, Artia, 1979. It probably also ate land-living animals, such as small archosaurs. The fossils of some smaller temnospondyls bear tooth marks made by Mastodonsaurus-like animals. Mastodonsaurus was once thought to be responsible for the footprints found in Triassic sandstones and described as Chirotherium, but more recent research had found that the tracks belong to crocodile-like pseudosuchian reptiles, especially aetosaurs. Species A reconstruction of M. torvus A large number of species have been attributed to the genus over the years. However, in a reexamination of the genus by Markus Moser and Rainer Schoch in 2007 only three of the species were determined to be valid. The type species M. jaegeri, the best known species M.giganteus, both from Europe, and M. torvus from Russia. The species M. acuminatus was shown to be a junior synonym to M. giganteus, while the species M. tantus & M. maximus were both determined to be synonyms of M. torvus.& 2007 \\"Revision of the type material and nomenclature of Mastodonsaurus giganteus (Jaeger) (Temnospondyli) from the middle Triassic of Germany\\" Palaeontology 505:1245-1266: The species M. andriani, M. indicus, M. laniarius, M. lavisi, M. meyeri, M. pachygnathus and M. silesiacus, when reexamined by Moser and Schoch, were not deemed as assignable to the genus Mastodonsaurus due to the fragmentary nature of the type specimens and as such are considered nomen dubium. Examination of the literature showed M. conicus to be a senior synonym of the genus M. ventricosus; however this species was never formally published and is thus considered a nomen nudum. =Formerly assigned species= * Mastodonsaurus cappelensis = Heptasaurus * Mastodonsaurus vaslenensis = possible heptasaurid. * Mastodonsaurus granulosus = Plagiosternum * Mastodonsaurus arenaceus = Capitosaurus * Mastodonsaurus robustus = Cyclotosaurus * Mastodonsaurus durus = Eupelor (metoposaurid) * Mastodonsaurus keuperinus = mix of Metoposaurus and indeterminate mastodonsaurid material. * Mastodonsaurus weigelti = junior synonym of Parotosuchus. * Labyrinthodon leptognathus = Stereospondyli indeterminateDamiani, Ross J.

Chueca was one of the most prominent figures of the g√©nero chico. Born in Madrid, Chueca entered the conservatory at eight years old, but his family later obligated him to abandon music to study medicine. He was arrested in 1866 as a participant in the student demonstrations against the Narv√°ez government. While he spent three days in the prison of San Francisco in Madrid, he composed several waltzes that he entitled Lamentos de un preso (\\"Lamentations of a Prisoner\\"). Later, Francisco Asenjo Barbieri helped orchestrate and direct the works, and their success helped Chueca leave medicine and devote himself once more to music. He worked as a pianist and directed the orchestra of the Teatro Variedades. He is considered a self- taught musician. In fact, he was more schooled in the sciences than in music, however Chueca had an intuitive talent and grace with melody and rhythm that produced many works. He worked with several collaborators like Barbieri, Tom√°s Bret√≥n, and especially Valverde, in many of his works. Works Among the many zarzuelas that Chueca wrote, some of the most notable are: *La canci√≥n de la Lola (1880) *La Gran V√≠a (1886) *C√°diz (1886) *El a√±o pasado por agua (1889) *El chaleco blanco (1890) *Agua, azucarillos y aguardiente (1897) *La alegr√≠a de la huerta (1900) *El bateo (1901) Synopses: ‚ÄúAgua, azucarillos y aguardiente!‚Äù - ‚ÄúWater, sweeties and aguardiente!‚Äù was a typical cry heard in the streets of Madrid in the late 19th century, as the vendors advertised their wares. The action of this Zarzuela focusses on the middle and lower classes in Madrid as they prepare for the San Lorenzo celebrations in August. The chorus includes all kinds of street vendors, soldiers, nannies and organ grinders. The story: The poor but ambitious Asia, and her mother, Do√±a Simona, have recently moved to Madrid from Valdepatata (potato valley!), but are unable to pay their rent. They tell their landlord, Don Aquilino, that they‚Äôll pay him with money they intend to borrow from Asia‚Äôs boyfriend, Seraf√≠n, the son of a rich senator. The landlord is amused at this idea, since he has recently had to lend money to Seraf√≠n. Pepa, a stall-holder who also owes rent to Don Aquilino, has been offered money by Seraf√≠n to put a sleeping tablet in Do√±a Simona‚Äôs drink the next time she accompanies him and her daughter on their daily walk. His intention is to seduce Asia without her mother‚Äôs permission. When Pepa‚Äôs boyfriend Lorenzo finds out, he persuades her that it‚Äôs a great idea, talks to Seraf√≠n himself and doubles the payment, keeping half for himself, which he then goes off to gamble with his friend Vicente. When Pepa uses her money to pay off Don Aquilino, he recognises the note as being one of those that he lent to Seraf√≠n. Meanwhile, Pepa is visited by Vicente‚Äôs girlfriend, Manuela, a rival water vendor without her own stall. Since Manuela‚Äôs boyfriend is Pepa‚Äôs ex, they have a colourful argument. Asia and her mother meet Pepa at her stall, where she tells them of Seraf√≠n‚Äôs plan to seduce Asia. Pepa agrees that when Seraf√≠n arrives, she will put the sleeping tablet in his drink instead, to serve him right. When Seraf√≠n arrives and orders the drinks, Asia‚Äôs mother pretends to fall asleep, whereupon Seraf√≠n tries to win over Asia, who persuades him to give her the rent money they need. At this point, the mother wakes up and the women suggest going for a walk. Seraf√≠n gets up but, having already drunk the sleeping potion, falls down fast asleep. Asia is disgusted by his behaviour and vows to return to Valdepatata. At midnight Pepa, Lorenzo, Manuela and Vicente dress up and go to the San Lorenzo party. Seraf√≠n is still asleep and in the confusion he is robbed by Garibaldi, a busker who plays the lyre. El Bateo - The Baptism The scene is set in the lower class suburbs of Madrid, around 1900. Preparations are being made for the baptism of the baby recently born to Nieves and her boyfriend Lolo. Friends and neighbours are celebrating with ‚ÄòSevillana‚Äô dances. The godfather is Wamba, a fierce anarchist. Nieves arrives to meet her mother, Valeriana, very upset at having met her ex-boyfriend, Pamplinas, who is determined to ruin the christening, having been betrayed by Nieves in the past. Visita, Lolo‚Äôs ex-girlfriend, is also jealous and decides to help Pamplinas in ruining the baptism. She takes advantage of Virginio, a young shop assistant who is very much in love with her, and persuades him to help her spread rumours of Nieves‚Äô infidelity. When Lolo arrives, Visita tells him she has heard rumours that the baby isn‚Äôt his. Lolo‚Äôs friends and family encourage him not to believe the rumours. Interlude - song and dance by the city‚Äôs barrel-organ grinders. At the church, the registrar tries to write down the details for the baptism, while Wamba complains that going to church is against his anarchist beliefs. He suggests the baby should be named Robespierre in honour of freedom. As the registrar completes the document with the names of the parents and godparents, Pamplinas appears and says the baptism cannot take place since the baby isn‚Äôt Lolo‚Äôs. A fight breaks out. The friends and neighbours are waiting to celebrate the baptism meal. A photographer takes pictures of the group and they dance a Gavotte. Wamba arrives and tells everyone what happened at the church. Nieves and Valeriana appear, having searched everywhere for Lolo and Pamplinas, who then arrive on the scene. Pamplinas says he wants everyone to know the truth about Nieves, who has been betraying Lolo just like she betrayed him. He says that every night at 2am, a man goes into Nieves‚Äô house. Wamba speaks up and confesses that it was him, and that he was visiting Valeriana! Everyone is happy and Nieves & Lolo, Wamba & Valeriana agree to get married and to baptise the baby the following day. They all blame Virgino for spreading the rumours. Legacy Madrid's gay neighborhood, Chueca, takes its name from its Plaza de Chueca which was named after him.

It stands on a lowland at the right bank of the San River, along the Przemy≈õl-Sanok route and some 10 kilometres southwest of Przemy≈õl. Across the centuries, the castle has belonged to several noble Polish families, and was visited by many Polish kings. Together with a picturesque garden, it now belongs to the Industrial Development Agency ().  History  Front view of the castle and bridge The construction of the castle started in 1580, initiated by a local nobleman Stanislaw Siecienski of Siecin, who came to the area from Mazovia. Works lasted for 53 years, and the castle was not completed until 1633, by Marcin Krasicki, son of Stanis≈Çaw and Voivode of Podolia, who in the meantime had changed his name. Originally, the castle was a fortified stronghold, protecting southern border of the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth. However, Marcin Krasicki, who was regarded as one of the most important promoter of arts in the country, turned the fortress into a sophisticated residence (palazzo in fortezza), under supervision of Italian architect, Galleazzo Appiani. Also, he dubbed the complex Krasiczyn, after his last name. Later, a village of Krasiczyn grew near the castle, also bearing the same name. The Krasiczyn castle was built on the site of an older, wooden complex, called Sliwnica, which had probably been built in the 14th century. Despite numerous fires and wars across the centuries, the castle's complex has been essentially unchanged since the early 17th century. Built as a square, with walls representing all four quarters of the globe, at the corners there are four oval-shaped towers: Divine (Boska), Papal (Papieska), Royal (Krolewska), and Noble (Szlachecka). These names reflected the eternal order of the world, with four grades of authority. The rectangular, spacious court is surrounded to the east and north by living quarters, and to the south and west by walls, adorned with attics. In the middle of the western wall, there is a square-shaped tower of the clock (Zegarowa), added by Marcin Krasicki at the beginning of the 17th century. This tower serves as a main gate, with a wall bridge over the moat. Across the centuries, the castle attracted most famous personalities of Polish history. Among visitors, there were kings Sigismund III Vasa, Wladyslaw IV Vasa, John II Casimir Vasa, and Augustus II the Strong. Sigismund III Vasa, of whom Marcin Krasicki was a loyal supporter, visited the castle thrice. For the first time, in 1608, together with wife Constance of Austria.  Architecture  The castle in the 19th century One of most precious elements of the complex is the chapel, located in the Divine Tower, which has been compared to the Sigismund's Chapel in Krakow‚Äôs Wawel Cathedral. Among other interesting things, there are richly sculpted portals, loggias, arcades, and unique sgraffito wall decorations, whose total area is about 7000 square meters. All works were overseen by Italian architects, and the details were completed by craftsmen from nearby Przemysl. The sgraffito depicted Roman emperors, Polish kings, members of the Krasicki family, hunting scenes, and saints of the Roman-Catholic Church. Unfortunately, most of the interior design has been destroyed, mostly by the Red Army soldiers, who were stationed there from October 1939 to June 1941 (see: Polish September Campaign, Operation Barbarossa). Near the castle, there is the Swiss Pavilion, connected with Krasiczyn by a secret passage. Standing also in the adjacent park is the Hunter‚Äôs Pavilion, a villa in \\"the hunter style\\". The park itself is abundant with birds and plants.  Owners  After Krasicki family died out in late 17th century, the complex was inherited by Urszula Modrzewska. Then it belonged to several other families: Wojakowscy, Tar≈Çowie (since 1724), Potoccy (since 1751), Pini≈Ñscy (since 1785). Finally, in 1835, the castle was purchased by prince Leon Sapieha, and his family owned the complex until 1944 (with the exception of the Soviet occupation in 1939-1941), when Communist government of Poland nationalized it. The Sapieha family invested plenty of money in the castle. They remodelled it, with the help of Engerth, an architect from Vienna, founded a sawmill, a brewery, and a small factory of farmers‚Äô appliances. They actively promoted economic development of the whole area. On 3 May 1852, a great fire destroyed most of the complex, except for the chapel, and it took several years to repair the damages. In 1867, one of the most important personalities of Polish Catholic Church, Cardinal Adam Stefan Sapieha was born here. Hunting scene - mannerist sgraffito on outer wall of the Krasicki Palace. In late 1941, after German invasion of Soviet Union, Andrzej Sapieha returned to the castle, which had been used as barracks for soldiers of the Red Army (see Molotov Line). This is his account of the premises: ‚ÄúOn the floors there is garbage, old clothes, destroyed books. Walls full of Soviet propaganda posters, no furniture, instead of it, wooden beds everywhere. The chapel is completely ruined, all sculptures on the walls destroyed as high as the savages could reach. Altars and pews destroyed. All three monuments have disappeared. The church in a terrible state, as it had been used as stables and a butcher shop. Metal coffins were used by the Bolsheviks as bathtubs‚Äù.  Currently  After World War II, the Communist government nationalized the complex and set up a high school of forestry in the buildings. In the 1970s, the castle was a property of automobile manufacturer from Warsaw. After the collapse of the Communist system, the castle found a new owner, Warsaw's Industrial Development Agency (Agencja Rozwoju Przemys≈Çu S.A.), which has carried out extensive renovation of the complex. As a result, in 2000, Krasiczyn was added to the association of hotels and restaurants located in historic buildings (European Castle Hotels & Restaurants). (The hotel is located in a side wing of the castle). Currently, Krasiczyn castle is a popular tourist attraction and there are organized sightseeing tours held here.

He was a graduate of the University of North Carolina. He won a Nieman Fellowship at Harvard University in 1957. In 1993, he returned to Harvard, where he was a fellow at the Kennedy School of Government. He died from an apparent heart attack, on November 25, 2011. Career =The New York Times= Wicker began working in professional journalism in 1949, as editor of the small-town Sandhill Citizen in Aberdeen, North Carolina. By the early 1960s, he had joined The New York Times. At the Times, he became well known as a political reporter; among other accomplishments, he wrote the paper's November 23, 1963 lead story of the assassination of President Kennedy, having ridden in a press bus in the Dallas motorcade that accompanied Kennedy. Wicker was a shrewd observer of the Washington, D.C. scene. In that capacity, his influential \\"In The Nation\\" column ran in the Times from 1966 through 1992. In an exit-interview Q & A with fellow Times reporter R. W. Apple, he reflected on one primary lesson of his years in the capital. Apple asked whether Wicker had \\"any heroes\\" in political life. ::I think it tends to work the other way. Which doesn't mean that I look at all those people with contempt‚Äîquite the opposite. But the journalist's perspective makes you see the feet of clay and the warts, and that's a good thing. I found them in many cases to be truly engaging human beings and admirable persons but not really, in the long run, impeccable heroes, or even just heroes without the \\"impeccable.\\" We should try to see people as clearly as we can. Then if a hero does come into view, why, we can give him his due. =Books= Wicker's 1975 book A Time to Die: The Attica Prison Revolt, which recounted the events at the Attica Correctional Facility in Attica, New York, during September 1971, received an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best Fact Crime book. He is also the author of several books about U.S. presidents, including Kennedy Without Tears: The Man Beneath the Myth (1964), JFK & LBJ: The Influence of Personality Upon Politics (1966), and One of Us: Richard Nixon and the American Dream (1991). Other volumes Wicker penned include Facing the Lions (1973), a novel about a presidential campaign involving a candidate modeled on Sen. Estes Kefauver; Unto This Hour (1984), a novel of the American Civil War, during the Second Battle of Bull Run (1862), Tragic Failure: Racial Integration in America (1996) and Shooting Star : The Brief Arc of Joe McCarthy (2006).

He committed his first three murders in late 1976 and early 1977, killing young women of similar appearance from nearby Isla Vista. His crimes motivated large demonstrations opposed to violence against women, and in favor of better transportation for the young people residing in Isla Vista.Dalton, Keith, Santa Barbara News-Press, January 25, 1977, p. 1. In 1979, he killed a young woman from Los Angeles. A fifth intended victim escaped with a bullet in her head, and later identified him in a Los Angeles bar. Early life Thor Nis Christiansen was born in Denmark, and immigrated to the United States with his parents when he was five years old. The family initially settled in Inglewood, California, and then moved to Solvang, where his father, Nis, ran a restaurant. Christiansen was a good student until his junior year of high school, when he began neglecting his schoolwork. He moved out of his parents' house, dropped out of school, and began working as a gas station attendant. During this time, Christiansen gained a great deal of weight, at one point weighing 275 pounds (125 kg).Santa Barbara News-Press, 18 June 1980. Murders Christiansen became obsessed with fantasies of shooting women and having sex with their corpses. He stole a .22 caliber pistol from a friend and committed his first three murders. He then moved to Oregon, lost weight, and moved back to Santa Barbara County to complete his high school diploma at a junior college. Christiansen moved into an apartment in Goleta with a woman in her twenties; they had met while she was hitchhiking. Christiansen committed another murder during this period. Secondary sources indicate Christiansen's modus operandi was to meet his victims while they were hitchhiking, then shoot them in the head with a .22 caliber pistol and sexually assault them post-mortem. Although several young women had disappeared from Isla Vista, California, in late 1976, Christiansen's first confirmed victim was Patricia Marie Laney, who disappeared January 18, 1977. The next day, her body was found on an isolated road in Refugio Canyon, in the Santa Ynez Mountains northwest of Isla Vista near Rancho del Cielo.Santa Barbara News-Press, 20 January 1977. Jacqueline Anne Rook's body was found the day after that, near Laney's.Santa Barbara News-Press, 21 January 1977. Mary Ann Sarris' body was found on May 22, 1977, near Los Alamos. Laura Sue Benjamin's body was found in a culvert near Angeles Forest Highway and Big Tujunga Road in the San Gabriel Mountains north of Los Angeles. Los Angeles Times, August 21, 1979 p. C8. She was reported to have been a prostitute.*YouTube \`The Hitchhiker Slayer' Christiansen shot his fifth intended victim, Lydia Preston, in the head, inside his vehicle, on April 18, 1979.

Because of Christiansen's address in Goleta, and the similarity of Preston's ordeal to evidence police had collected in the Rook, Sarris, and Laney cases, Christiansen became a suspect in the Isla Vista murders. After his arrest, Santa Barbara County law enforcement realized they had investigated him as a suspect (among approximately one hundred others) in 1977. They noted his possession of a .22 caliber pistol during an earlier arrest for being a minor in possession of alcohol.Hurst, John and Belcher, Jerry, Los Angeles Times, July 28, 1979, p. B1. Trial Christiansen was first tried in early 1980 in Santa Monica for the murder of Benjamin. He initially pleaded insanity, but withdrew the plea. Los Angeles Times, Feb. 15, 1980, p. B2. In June, 1980, he pleaded guilty to the Isla Vista murders,Manson, Joe, The Daily Nexus, June 4, 1980, p. 1. and was sentenced to life in prison.Hardy, Dave, Santa Barbara News-Press, June 18, 1980, p. B-1. Death On March 30, 1981, Christiansen died after being stabbed in the exercise yard at Folsom State Prison. His killer was not identified.Santa Barbara News-Press, 31 March 1981. According to his defense attorney, James Westwick, psychiatrists had warned that Christiansen would be in danger in prison, due to the sexual nature of his murders and his youthful, blond appearance. Aftermath Patricia Laney has become a prominent symbol for groups that advocate against violence to women in the Santa Barbara/Goleta/Isla Vista area. She had been a community volunteer with organizations that advocated against violence to women. The Isla Vista Juggling Festival has been held annually in her memory since 1977, and is still active as of 2019.Eckstein, Harriet, Santa Barbara Independent, 1996.

A French garrison of 630 men, including two companies of the French Foreign Legion, successfully defended the French post of Tuyen Quang against vastly outnumbering Chinese forces in a four-month siege from 24 November 1884 to 3 March 1885. 'Tuyen Quang 1885' remains one of the Legion's proudest battle honours.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 237‚Äì41  Background  Black Flag soldier The French installed a post at Tuyen Quang in June 1884, in the wake of their capture of Hung Hoa and Thai Nguyen. Tuyen Quang, an isolated settlement on the Clear River, was the most westerly French outpost in Tonkin, and was 80 kilometres from the nearest French post at Phu Doan. During the summer and autumn of 1884 it was garrisoned by two companies of the 1st Battalion, 1st Foreign Legion Regiment (Captains Chmitelin and Broussier), under the command of chef de bataillon Frauger. The outbreak of the Sino- French War on 23 August 1884 exposed the post to attack by Tang Jingsong's Yunnan Army and Liu Yongfu‚Äôs Black Flags. Supply difficulties delayed the Chinese concentration around Tuyen Quang, but advance elements of the Yunnan Army began to harass the post in October 1884, and Frauger's garrison had to fight off a number of nuisance attacks by the Chinese. Malaria had also taken a heavy toll of Frauger's men, and by the end of October 170 men out of the garrison's total strength of 550 men were unfit for duty.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 237‚Äì8 In November 1884 General Louis Bri√®re de l'Isle, the commander of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps, took steps to resupply and reinforce Hung Hoa, Thai Nguyen and Tuyen Quang. On 19 November a column making for Tuyen Quang under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Jacques Duchesne was ambushed in the Yu Oc gorge by the Black Flags but was able to fight its way through to the beleaguered post. Frauger and his men were relieved, and replaced by a fresh garrison of 400 legionnaires and 160 Tonkinese riflemen under the command of chef de bataillon Marc-Edmond Domin√© of the 2nd African Light Infantry Battalion. Duchesne left Tuyen Quang on 23 November, and on the following day Domin√© formally declared Tuyen Quang to be in a state of siege. The siege of Tuyen Quang would last for just over four months.Huard, 462‚Äì6; Hubert, 28‚Äì36; Huguet, 23‚Äì43 and 49‚Äì54; Lecomte, Lang-Son, 116‚Äì19 and 141‚Äì7; Lonlay, Au Tonkin, 363‚Äì5; L‚Äôamiral Courbet, 105; Nicolas, 385‚Äì6; Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 238‚Äì9; Histoire militaire, 101‚Äì2  Forces involved  Tang Jingsong (1841‚Äì1903), the commander of the Yunnan Army in the siege of Tuyen Quang Chef de bataillon Marc-Edmond Domin√© (1848‚Äì1920), the commander of the Tuyen Quang garrisonThe new garrison of Tuyen Quang, just under 630 men strong, consisted of two companies of the 1st Battalion, 1st Foreign Legion Regiment (Captains de Borelli and Moulinay) under the overall command of Captain Cattelin, a company of Tonkinese riflemen under the command of the French marine infantry officer Captain Dia, a scratch battery of six light cannon (Lieutenant Derappe) and small engineering and field hospital detachments. The garrison was supported by the Farcy gunboat Mitrailleuse (enseigne de vaisseau Senes), at anchor in the Clear River close to the French post.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 238‚Äì9 The Chinese army besieging Tuyen Quang was under the overall command of Tang Jingsong (Tang Jingsong, ÂîêÊôØÂ¥ß). The Chinese forces consisted of 9,000 men of the Yunnan Army and 3,000 men of Liu Yongfu's Black Flag Army. The Yunnan Army forces were divided into two divisions, commanded by Tang's lieutenants Ding Huai (Ting Huai, ‰∏ÅÊßê) and He Xiulin (Ho Hsiu-lin, ‰ΩïÁßÄÊûó).Lung Chang, 330  The fortress of Tuyen Quang  The French fortress at Tuyen Quang was typical of the small, remote outposts of France‚Äôs colonial empire. Lying on the western bank of the Clear River next to the Tonkinese village of Tuyen Quang, it consisted of a square masonry citadel, each of whose walls was 300 yards long. Inside the citadel‚Äôs perimeter were several barrack buildings, a lake and a large earthen mound in the shape of a sugar loaf. This hill, which looked just like a natural formation, took the place at Tuyen Quang of the tower traditionally found in Tonkinese citadels.Lonlay, Au Tonkin, 366 The citadel was overlooked by a number of wooded hills, which the Chinese were bound to occupy. There was little Domin√© could do to stop Chinese snipers from using these hills to fire down into the citadel, but he could at least delay the main enemy assault by building outworks to keep the Chinese at a respectable distance from the main perimeter. Accordingly, he had a blockhouse built on a hill 300 metres to the south of the citadel, which was occupied by a strong force of legionnaires. He also built a separate defensive perimeter to the southeast of Tuyen Quang which was occupied by Captain Dia and his company of Tonkinese riflemen. This position, centred on a fortified pagoda on the river bank, was christened 'Little Gibraltar'. These positions could be evacuated if necessary, and as long as they held they would severely limit the pressure the Chinese could exert on the fortress itself.Lonlay, Au Tonkin, 370; Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 239  The investment  The French post at Tuyen Quang: 'a small outpost overlooked from all sides' Map of the siege of Tuyen Quang In November 1884 the Yunnan Army gradually advanced down the Red River from Lao Cai towards Tuyen Quang, building a chain of entrenched camps at Pho En, Man Lanh, Ao Loc, Van Kieng and Son Long. In December the Chinese built three enormous fortified camps as bases for the siege of Tuyen Quang, at Thanh Quan, Ca Lanh and Phu An Binh. For much of this period the only enemy troops around Tuyen Quang were Liu Yongfu's Black Flags (3,000 men) and an advance guard of the Yunnan Army under Tang Jingsong's personal command (2,000 men). The Chinese investment of the French post only began to bite in the second half of December. By the beginning of January 1885 the Chinese had 4,000 men facing the French at Tuyen Quang, 5,000 men protecting their long and vulnerable supply line back to Lao Cai, and 3,000 men deployed between Tuyen Quang and Phu Doan, who were busy fortifying a strong blocking position at Hoa Moc. The besiegers gradually drew their lines closely around the French post at Tuyen Quang, occupying the villages of Phu An Binh, Dong Yen and Ya Ho to the west of the fortress and Yla, Ung Di and Truong Mu to the northwest.  The siege  A Legion sniper at Tuyen Quang On 31 December 1884 the Chinese launched an initial attack, which was repelled with losses. They attacked again on 10 January and 26 January 1885, but with no more success. But at the same time they had diverted more than 1,000 men to work on digging saps in order to approach the walls of the fortress from the southwest and the north simultaneously. On 27 January their trenches were less than 1,000 metres from the French walls, and they began to sap towards the blockhouse. As its communications with the citadel were threatened, the blockhouse had to be abandoned on 30 January. The guns which Domin√© had at his disposal were of too low a calibre to do any serious damage to the enemy trenches.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 239‚Äì40 The Chinese converted the abandoned French blockhouse into a fortified position for a battery of four cannon and drew their encirclement of the French post closer. From then on, attacks were made on the French positions almost daily and the defenders were subjected to an almost continual barrage of cannon, mortar and rifle fire from all sides. The French did what they could to respond. Domin√© posted 25 crack Legion marksmen on the citadel's watchtowers with orders to fire at Chinese soldiers working as labourers on the approach saps in order to disrupt the progress of the Chinese siege works. The Legion snipers normally took nine or ten victims a day, and by the end of the siege estimated that they had accounted for over 700 enemy soldiers. Domin√© occasionally brought his own artillery into play, and the gunboat Mitrailleuse harassed the Chinese positions on the Clear River with Hotchkiss fire. The Chinese responded by deploying their own snipers on hill positions around the French post. They rarely hit their targets, but the weight of plunging fire they were able to bring to bear severely restricted movement inside the fortress.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 240 The fourth Chinese assault on the Tuyen Quang perimeter, 22 February 1885 Having successfully forced the French from the outlying blockhouse by siege tactics, the Chinese sapped relentlessly towards the French perimeter wall. If they could mine the walls and collapse sections of the defence perimeter, they could bring their superior numbers to bear by assaulting the French through open breaches. The Chinese intentions were obvious, and the French engineering sergeant Jules Bobillot did his best to frustrate them. Both the French and the Chinese feverishly dug galleries and counter-galleries. On 11 February a pick-axe blow severed the membrane which separated a French from a Chinese miner, and an underground revolver fight took place. The French tried vainly to flood the Chinese saps, which were lower than theirs. On the evening of 12 February the first Chinese mine was exploded beneath the perimeter wall, but its effect was weakened by the counter-galleries and a subsequent Chinese assault was repelled with heavy losses. Another mine, which exploded on 13 February, made a 15-metre breach in the southwest wall of the citadel. Captain Moulinay rushed to the threatened point with his company, halted an enemy attack, and threw the assailants back to their forward trenches. The body of a French legionnaire was thrown onto the enemy parapets by the force of the explosion, and on the following night Corporal Beulin of the Legion took a party of three soldiers to go out into no-man's-land and recover it. Legionnaires of the Tuyen Quang garrison advance to crown the breach in the perimeter wall, 22 February 1885 On 17 February the Chinese brought up fresh guns, and the bombardment (cannon and mortar fire by night, rifle fire by day) now continued without a pause. Most of the buildings became uninhabitable, and the French had to abandon them and live in foxholes. Supplies of cigarettes had by now run out, trying the defenders' nerves still further. Sleep became increasingly difficult, and in daytime most French soldiers not on duty at the perimeter wall were busy digging additional inner defences. Domin√© had a redoubt built in the southeast corner of the fortress, where a final stand could be made if the Chinese carried the perimeter walls by assault. At 7 a.m. on 22 February the Chinese delivered their fourth assault. After exploding a mine and making a feint attack to draw the defenders onto the breach, they exploded a second mine under them which killed 12 legionnaires and wounded 20 more. Captain Moulinay, the ranking officer, and 2nd Lieutenant Vincent were both killed in the explosion. The Chinese then charged across the open breach. They were thrown back by a countercharge led by Commandant Domin√© in person. Meanwhile, the Chinese exploded a third mine under another section of the perimeter which collapsed almost 60 yards of wall. This explosion was the signal for a Chinese general assault. Hundreds of Chinese soldiers poured out of their trenches and advanced towards the two gaping breaches in the French defences, but the French had now recovered from the shock of the second mine, and drove them back with relative ease. A fifth Chinese assault was delivered on 24 February, and a sixth on 25 February. Like their predecessors, both assaults were decisively repulsed. But although the garrison had beaten off six attempts to storm its positions, it had lost over a third of its strength (50 dead and 224 wounded) sustaining a heroic defence against overwhelming odds. By the end of February it was clear that Tuyen Quang would fall unless it was relieved immediately.Lonlay, Au Tonkin, 363‚Äì437; Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 240‚Äì41; Histoire militaire, 102‚Äì3 and 107‚Äì8 The relief Fights at Tuyen Quang Enemy soldiers captured by the French at Tuyen Quang During January and February 1885 the besiegers were able to place enormous pressure on the garrison because the bulk of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps was committed to the Lang Son Campaign (February 1885). However, the capture of Lang Son on 13 February 1885 allowed the French to come to the relief of Tuyen Quang. General Bri√®re de l‚ÄôIsle personally led Lieutenant- Colonel Laurent Giovanninelli's 1st Brigade back to Hanoi, and then upriver to the relief of Tuyen Quang. The brigade, reinforced at Phu Doan on 24 February by a small column from Hung Hoa under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel de Maussion, found the route to Tuyen Quang blocked by a strong Chinese defensive position at Hoa Moc. On 2 March 1885 Giovanninelli attacked the left flank of the Chinese defensive line. The Battle of Hoa Moc was the most fiercely fought action of the Sino-French War. Two French assaults were decisively repulsed, and although the French eventually stormed the Chinese positions, they suffered heavy casualties.Huguet, 89‚Äì93; Lecomte, Lang-Son, 324‚Äì9; Vie militaire, 215‚Äì31; Nicolas, 402‚Äì9; Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 247‚Äì8; Histoire militaire, 107‚Äì8 Nevertheless, their costly victory cleared the way to Tuyen Quang. The Yunnan Army and the Black Flags raised the siege and drew off to the west, and the relieving force entered the beleaguered post on the afternoon of 3 March.Lonlay, Au Tonkin, 437‚Äì48; Huguet, 95‚Äì9; Lecomte, Vie militaire, 233‚Äì53 Three days earlier, on 28 February, the Chinese had made a seventh and final assault on the Tuyen Quang perimeter. Knowing that the relief column was close and that it would be their last chance to capture the post, the Chinese attacked with fanatical courage but once again failed to force the breach. On 2 March the men of the Tuyen Quang garrison listened anxiously to the sounds of rifle and cannon fire from the Yu Oc gorge, where the 1st Brigade was fighting to break through to the beleaguered post. Hopes of relief faded as the sounds of battle continued well into the night. It seemed all too likely that Giovanninelli's men had been halted by the Black Flags. On the morning of 3 March, to their amazement, the defenders awoke to find that the Chinese had abandoned the siege. Domin√© sent out fighting patrols to scout the enemy trenches. The last French fatality of the siege was suffered during a skirmish with a small Chinese rearguard. Legionnaire Striebler saw a Chinese soldier sighting on Captain de Borelli and threw himself between the two men. Striebler was killed instantly by the bullet intended for his captain. The incident, unsurprisingly, haunted de Borelli for the rest of his life. Several years later he made what amends he could by publishing a moving poem to the fellowship of the French Foreign Legion, A mes hommes qui sont morts. The arrival of the relief column on the afternoon of 3 March was greeted with jubilation by the defenders. Captain Jean-Fran√ßois- Alphonse Lecomte, who had marched with Giovanninelli's brigade, recorded the encounter between Captain de Borelli and General Bri√®re de l'Isle: > We approached the fortress. At the head of a group of officers we saw a > captain with a long white beard, who was flourishing his cane and dancing an > impromptu jig. The first man he met in the relief column was a bugler. He > threw his arms around him. Then he embraced the second bugler. The band > tried to keep its dignity, but to no avail. He then abandoned the buglers > and fell on the neck of the first drummer. For a moment the drum stood > between him and the object of his affections, but eventually he managed to > plant two loud kisses on the drummer‚Äôs cheeks. Then he made for the general- > in-chief. There was a sudden hush, as when an orchestra falls silent at the > end of a dance. He recovered himself, solemnly clicked his heels, and > saluted General Bri√®re de l‚ÄôIsle. We recognised Captain de Borelli. \\"Good > afternoon, Captain, how are you? We‚Äôre delighted to see you!\\" \\"Indeed! Me > too! Especially as I only just escaped being killed this morning!\\"Lecomte, > Vie militaire, 236‚Äì7  Casualties  Sergeant Jules Bobillot The casualties of the Tuyen Quang garrison during the siege were 50 dead and 224 wounded. The dead included the engineering sergeant Jules Bobillot, whose energetic countermeasures had delayed the progress of the Chinese siege works. Bobillot became a national hero in France after his death, and streets in many French towns and villages still bear his name. Casualties in Giovanninelli's 1st Brigade at the Battle of Hoa Moc were 76 dead and 408 wounded.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 241 The Chinese and Black Flags are believed to have suffered casualties of around 1,000 dead and 2,000 wounded during the siege of Tuyen Quang and the battle of Hoa Moc. The dead included two senior Chinese officers: the general Liu Jiegao (Liu Chieh- kao, ÂäâÁØÄÈ´ò), shot dead while leading a charge during the fourth Chinese assault on 22 February, and Tan Jingde (T'an Ching-te, Ë´áÊï¨Âæ∑), one of Tang Jingsong‚Äôs battalion commanders, who was also killed while leading an assault.Lung Chang, 331  Significance  Pagoda bell from the siege of Tuyen Quang. Mus√©e de l'Arm√©e, Paris. In France, the defence of Tuyen Quang became the defining image of the Sino-French War. Domin√©'s day-by-day diary of the siege was published in full in the Journal officiel, and an order of the day issued by Bri√®re de l'Isle to the men of the Tuyen Quang garrison on 4 March 1885 enjoyed instant celebrity: > Sous le commandement d'un chef h√©ro√Øque, le chef de bataillon Domin√©, vous > avez tenu t√™te pendant trente-six jours, au nombre de six cents, √† une > arm√©e, dans une bicoque domin√©e de toutes parts.

The siege also reflected credit on Tang Jingsong's generalship and the professional skills of the Yunnan Army. The Yunnan Army contained a large number of officers and men who had learned the art of siege warfare under Marshal Ma Rulong (Ma Ju-lung, È¶¨Â¶ÇÈæç), who crushed a Moslem insurrection in Yunnan in the early 1870s. Captain Jean-Fran√ßois-Alphonse Lecomte, one of the more discerning officers of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps, paid tribute to the skill the Yunnan Army had shown in its siegecraft at Tuyen Quang: > The mandarins had directed the attack on Tuyen Quang in a very intelligent > manner. Owing to the Moslem insurrection in Yunnan, an insurrection that had > nearly engulfed the entire province and was only put down by Marshal Ma > after several sieges, they were now experts in the art of siegecraft. Their > troops were excellent, and although they were unable to capture the > fortress, defended as it was by a handful of heroes and relieved in the very > nick of time by Giovanninelli‚Äôs brigade, this siege was nonetheless a > glorious feat of arms for the Celestials and showed that when necessary they > could rise to the occasion.Lecomte, Vie militaire, 246‚Äì7 Notes References * Boisset, T., A travers le Tonkin pendant la guerre (Paris, 1892) * Dukay, P., Les h√©ros de Tuyen-Quan (Paris, 1933) * Harmant, J., La verit√© sur la retraite de Lang-Son (Paris, 1892) * Hubert, C., Le colonel Domin√© - Alg√©rie, Arm√©e de la Loire, Tonkin, D√©fense de Tuyen-Quan 1885 (Paris, 1938) * Huguet, E, En colonne: souvenirs d'Extr√™me-Orient (Paris, 1888) * Lecomte, J., La vie militaire au Tonkin (Paris, 1893) * Lecomte, J., Lang-Son: combats, retraite et n√©gociations (Paris, 1895) * Lonlay, D. de, Au Tonkin, 1883‚Äì1886: r√©cits anecdotiques (Paris, 1886) * Lonlay, D. de, Le si√®ge de Tuyen-Quan (Paris, 1886) (= Au Tonkin, 363‚Äì448) * Nicolas, V., Livre d'or de l'infanterie de la marine (Paris, 1891) * Lung Chang [ÈæçÁ´†], Yueh-nan yu Chung-fa chan-cheng [Ë∂äÂçóËàá‰∏≠Ê≥ïÊà∞Áà≠, Vietnam and the Sino-French War] (Taipei, 1993) * Thomazi, A., Histoire militaire de l'Indochine fran√ßais (Hanoi, 1931) * Thomazi, A., La conqu√™te de l'Indochine (Paris, 1934) Category:Battles of the Sino-French War Tuyen-Quan Tuyen-Quan Category:Conflicts in 1884 Category:Conflicts in 1885 Category:1884 in Vietnam Category:1885 in Vietnam Category:History of Tuy√™n Quang Province Tuyen Quang ","title":"Siege of Tuy√™n Quang"},{"id":"5659518","text":"Desperado is a hypercoaster located in Primm, Nevada, United States at the Buffalo Bill's Hotel and Casino, a part of the Primm Valley Resorts complex.

They are typically mimics of bees or stinging wasps, often black with yellow, red, or white markings, sometimes metallic, with a robust mesosoma and very strong sculpturing. The hind femora are often greatly enlarged, with a row of teeth or serrations along the lower margin as in Chalcididae. The wing has a longitudinal fold. The female ovipositor is sometimes short, but if not, it is recurved and lies along the dorsal side of the metasoma, a unique feature. The males are also unusual, in the fusion of many of the metasomal segments to form a capsule-like \\"carapace\\". Leucospidae are external parasitoids of larval hymenoptera, mostly solitary bees but some solitary wasps, and there is a case of a hyperparasitoid. The eggs are laid inside the nests of the host and upon hatching, they feed on the host larva and usually only a single adult parasite emerges from a single host brood cell. Leucospis pinna which parasitizes the orchid bee Eulaema meriana is known to have multiple adults emerging from a single brood cell of the host. Leucopsis dorsigera is considered a hyperparasite as it is a parasite of Xorides sp. which in turn is a parasitoid of a cerambycid beetle larva boring inside the stems of apricots. Leucospids are rarely encountered except in areas where their hosts are abundant; in the United States, the most well-known species is Leucospis affinis, which parasitizes leafcutter bees. There are four genera with about 130 species are known of which nearly 44 are from the New World, mostly from the Neotropics. A fossil species Leucospis glaesaria has been described from Early Miocene amber from the Dominican Republic. The Leucospidae have traditionally been suggested as a sister group of the Chalcididae based on morphology but a 2011 phylogenetic analysis found that the Leucospidae were a monophyletic lineage but with uncertain placement within the Chalcidoidea and not closely related to the Chalcididae. The study found that the genus Oodera (Pteromalidae: Cleonyminae) was close to the Leucospidae, a result confirmed by a 2018 study.

Wilby Wonderful tells the story about 24 hours in the life of the small town of Wilby, where the municipal festival is in preparation. It focuses on the changes occurring in the lives of several different inhabitants as development comes to the island and threatens to change the world around them. The title comes from a sign created to promote the town; comically, it has been painted wrong, and says \\"Wilby Wonderful\\", as opposed to \\"Wonderful Wilby\\". Wilby Wonderful received a 71% rating from review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 7 reviews.Wilby Wonderful @ Rotten Tomatoes Plot In the small Canadian Maritimes island town of Wilby, Dan Jarvis (James Allodi), the town's video store owner, is preparing to kill himself by jumping off a bridge; however, the presence of the town's lovable handyman, Walter \\"Duck\\" MacDonald (Callum Keith Rennie), stops him from doing so. Dan's next three suicide attempts all kept on getting interrupted. His next attempt is to drown himself by stuffing rocks in his pocket at the shore of Wilby Watch, a large undeveloped area on the island, but is forced to leave when local reporters were there, interviewing local police Stan Lastman (Daniel MacIvor) about a police raid at the Wilby Watch. The local newspaper is planning to publish the names of the men caught during the raid. Dan then tries to give himself carbon monoxide poisoning by stuffing his head into a turned-on oven, but this was also interrupted, this time by Carol French (Sandra Oh), the realtor trying to sell the house. Finally, Dan prepares to hang himself but is forced to stop when he is caught by Jennie (Devon Chisolm), the maid of the motel he was staying. Elsewhere, Buddy (Paul Gross), Carol's husband and Stan's police partner, struggles with discussing his marriage to Carol, and his ongoing affair with Sandra Anderson (Rebecca Jenkins), who is infamous in the town for her reputation as a promiscuous woman. Sandra's teenage daughter, Emily (Ellen Page), quietly observes her mother's behavior, while hoping for a serious romance for herself, different from her mother's history, although she is dating Taylor (Caleb Langille), a boy whose intentions are a bit more basic than the romance Emily hopes for. Emily's no-nonsense and frank best friend, Mackenzie Fisher (Marcella Grimaux) is the daughter of the town's mayor, Brent (Maury Chaykin), who is considering buying Buddy's mother's house (that Carol is selling). While at lunch with Carol's assistant Deena (Kathryn MacLellan), Sandra encounters a woman whose son she went out with in high school (at the same time that he was dating someone else). Duck has been trying to get hold of Dan's location all day, by visiting places he might be around, although it's not clear the nature of his intentions are. Dan himself finds that his estranged wife, Belle, has thrown out all of his possessions out of their once-shared home. Carol realizes the city's big banner on the bridge is written as \\"Wilby Wonderful\\" instead of the other way around, and after talking to Deena, confronts Duck about the mistake (several characters later hypothesize that Duck is dyslexic), but then Carol rambles on about her failing marriage. Buddy and Stan are investigating Wilby Watch when Stan finds five syringes; Buddy is skeptical about Stan's claim that the syringes must have been left there by drug addicts. Sandra brings Dan coffee he tried to purchase from her diner (which he left after a homophobic encounter) but she failed to crack through his walls. Sandra then goes to see Buddy and calls him affectionately, unaware that Duck is nearby, and ultimately, both decides to end the affair. Sandra, drunk, tries to force Emily to bring a condom with her on her date with Taylor that night, but Emily refuses, calling Sandra out for her promiscuous ways and vows to have a different romance life on her own. Buddy and Carol host Mayor Brent's family who visit their house, and Mackenzie revealed to Buddy that her father has been trying to play up the scandal and turn the Wilby Watch into a golf course. Sandra leaves the pack early to prepare Buddy's mother's house for the mayor's visit, and Buddy leaves soon after, returning to inspect the Wilby Watch. Duck, who waited well into the night in front of the motel Dan is staying, is finally able to meet up and talk to him. Duck sets the tone of their conversation to be more and more intimate as it goes, and Dan, who is distant at first, opens up to him, eventually telling Duck his favorite genre of movie. Duck goes to kiss him, but Dan backs out. As Duck leaves, he notices that Emily and Taylor, who are on the same motel in a nearby room, are having a fight over him persistently trying to have sex with her. Duck shoos Taylor away, and calms a breaking down Emily. The two of them talk in Duck's truck, and then witness Dan leaving the area. Emily asks Duck if he wants to say hi to Dan, but Duck says he already tried that. Dan, trying his luck on killing himself one more time, sneaks into Buddy's mother's house and prepares to hang himself from the ceiling. However, he visibly has a change of heart halfway through, and smiles at the thought of Duck almost kissing him. However, as Dan tries to undone the rope around his neck, the chair he's standing on gives away, hanging him. Carol arrives at the house to prepare for the Mayor's family arrival at that moment, and after cutting the rope off, instead hides Dan's body under the stairs cupboard, hoping to hide him long enough until the Mayor and his family leaves. Mackenzie ends up finding Dan's body, and ambulance is called. At the Wilby Watch, Buddy finds that Stan is planting used insulin syringes as evidence. The next day, Sandra and Emily forgive each other for their previous drunken encounter. Buddy forces Mayor Brent to abandon his plans to turn the Wilby Watch into a golf course, and then takes steps towards mending his relationship with Carol. Duck brings flowers for Dan, who survived his suicide, at the hospital, and the movie ends with both men tenderly caressing each other.

As told by him, his father, Kamal-ud-Din, a farmer, along with his family started migrating from East Punjab and reached Pakistan in around four months in the autumn of 1947. His family lost 36 of its members when migrating from Hisar, Haryana (erstwhile Punjab) to Lahore during the partition of India. He's called hafiz because he memorized the Qur'an during his childhood, a time during which he was already enthusiastic about the verses on jihad.

In 1987, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, along with Abdullah Azzam, founded Markaz Dawa-Wal-Irshad, a group with roots in the Jamiat Ahl-e-Hadis. This organisation spawned the jihadist group Lashkar-e-Taiba in 1990, with the help of Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence officers.

The State Department also maintained LeT's designation as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation and added the following aliases to its listing of LeT: Jama‚Äôat-ud-Dawa, Al-Anfal Trust, Tehrik-i- Hurmat-i-Rasool, and Tehrik-i-Tahafuz Qibla Awwal. The Department of Treasury said that LeT was responsible for the November 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai which killed nearly 200 people. The group's leader is Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, who is listed under UN Security Council Resolution 1267.\\"26/11 Mastermind Hafiz Saeed‚Äôs Terror Group Jamaat-ud-Dawa banned in Pakistan\\", 'DBPOST. 22 February 2019. = Cooperation with Islamabad = In keeping with Pakistani establishment's wishes, Lashkar has been keeping focus on India and Saeed is among those who are thought to have helped Pakistan in capturing important al- Qaeda members like Abu Zubaydah. Senior Pakistani officials have said that Saeed is helping in de-radicalisation and rehabilitation of former extremists and that security is being provided to him because he could be targeted by militants who disapprove of Saeed's co-operation with Islamabad. = US bounty = In April 2012, the United States announced a bounty of US$10 million on Hafeez Saeed, for his role in the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Saeed stated that he had nothing to do with the Mumbai attacks and condemned them. When asked about the bounty, Saeed replied, \\"I am living my life in the open and the US can contact me whenever they want.\\" He subsequently stated that he was ready to face \\"any American court\\" to answer the charges and added that if Washington wanted to contact him, they knew where he was. \\"This is a laughable, absurd announcement. Here I am in front of everyone, not hiding in a cave,\\" he said in a press conference. Saeed identified his leading role in the Difa-e- Pakistan Council and US attempts to placate India as reasons behind the bounty. Arrest and trial  On 3 July 2019, 23 cases related to terror financing and money laundering under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), 1997 were registered by Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Pakistan. According to CTD, JuD was financing terrorism from the funds collected by several non- profit organisations and trusts that included Al-Anfaal Trust, Dawatul Irshad Trust, Muaz Bin Jabal Trust, etc. CTD had banned these non-profit organisations in April 2019. On further investigations, CTD had found that these organisations were linked with JuD and were in touch with the top leadership of JuD. On 17 July, Saeed was arrested in Gujranwala by the Punjab CTD on the charges of terror financing. He was subsequently sent to the prison on judicial remand by a Gujranwala Anti Terrorism Court (ATC). On 27 September 2019, during the United Nations General Assembly, USA asked Pakistan to prosecute Saeed, Masood Azhar and other UN-designated terrorists. On 30 November 2019, the Government of Pakistan stated that they will prosecute Saeed. On 11 December 2019, he was indicted by the ATC in the charges of terror financing in several cities of Punjab province of Pakistan. As of December 2019, Saeed resides in the Kot Lakhpat jail also known as Central Jail Lahore. He was convicted for five years by a Pakistan court for financing terrorism, in February 2020.  Views  = Pakistani government = Hafiz Saeed has criticised Pakistani leaders and has stated that they should aspire to be more like British Prime Minister David Cameron and London Mayor Boris Johnson. He had declared his admiration for the British Conservative Party along with several Tory MPs when he lodged a petition to the Lahore High Court calling for public officials in Pakistan to tone down their privileged lifestyles. According to The Daily Telegraph, Saeed wrote in the petition that while Pakistan's political elite were 'living like kings and princes in palatial government houses,' Britain's prime minister lived in a 'four-bedroom flat.' He added, 'When the sun never set on the British Empire, the chief executive of that great country lived in the same house of a few marlas in a small street. That is truly Islamic, that is like following the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet.' Speaking on the issue of arrest of separatist Kashmiri leader Masarat Alam by the Jammu and Kashmir government, Saeed said, \\"Jihad is the duty of an Islamic government ... there is a government in Pakistan and it has always taken the stand that it is the right of Kashmiris to attain freedom. I say what our Army will do to secure the right of the Kashmiris is jihad ... We extend help to Kashmiris alongside government ... we call this jihad.\\" Criticising his anti-India comments, Indian Muslim leader Asaduddin Owaisi said, \\"People like Hafiz Saeed are unaware about teachings of Islam, jihad in Islam. They are killing innocent lives in Pakistan, children are being killed. They are using Pakistan for maligning another country. The Government of India should take strict action against it and I condemn his comments in clear and strong words.\\" = Indian government = In January 2013, India's then Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde released a statement on the alleged existence of Hindu terrorism as well as the existence of Hindu terror camps on Indian soil, being run and organised by the BJP and the RSS. As a result, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jamaat-ud-Dawa welcomed Shinde's statements and congratulated him for admitting the existence of Hindu terrorism. Hafiz Saeed demanded that the United States take serious notice of this statement by the Indian home minister regarding Hindu terrorist camps in India. \\"The US should now carry out drone attacks on these terror camps in India,\\" Saeed said. In September 2014, Saeed accused India of \\"water terrorism\\". Though there was flood crisis in India too, Saeed blamed India for flood crisis in Pakistan. In several tweets on social media he said, \\"Indian gov discharged water in rivers without notification & has given false information; an act of open mischief,\\" \\"India has used water to attack Pakistan, We are in state of War. India's water aggression must be taken to the UN security council.\\" Responding to a question about the nuclear warning issued by Indian authorities in Jammu and Kashmir after the 2013 India‚ÄìPakistan border incidents, Saeed said that in case of a nuclear war between India and Pakistan, India should distribute nuclear safety pamphlets in Delhi, Mumbai and Calcutta rather than in Kashmir. = Punjabi as national language = Hafiz Saeed has questioned Pakistan's decision to adopt Urdu (only 8% of Pakistanis speak Urdu as a first language) as its national language in a country where the majority of people speak the Punjabi language. He advocated that Punjabi should be made the national language.

It was founded in 1908 by Dr. Isaiah Fawkes Everhart, a local medical doctor and skilled taxidermist. Many of the specimens in the museum's extensive ornithological collection came from Dr. Everhart's personal collection. In addition to the zoological displays, the permanent collection includes works of visual art (many by Northeastern Pennsylvanian artists), ethnological artifacts, and fossils. The museum has an excellent permanent display of American folk art.  History  = Founding = The Everhart Museum of Natural History, Science & Art was founded by Dr. Isaiah Everhart, a Scranton-area philanthropist and ornithological enthusiast. When the museum opened its doors on May 30, 1908, there were only eight other public museums found in the Commonwealth, none of which were located in Northeastern Pennsylvania. Dr. Everhart‚Äôs gift to the City of Scranton was intended to bring the world to his community. His goal was to create an institution that would ‚Äúeducate and delight for generations to come.‚Äù Following military service as a surgeon during the Civil War, Dr. Everhart conceived the idea of assembling a comprehensive collection of Pennsylvania's native birds and animals. A skilled taxidermist, he built a collection of mounted specimens which soon expanded into one of the finest and largest collections in the United States. In 1905, he composed a will specifying that funds from his estate be used to construct the \\"Dr. I.F. Everhart general museum to be built in Nay Aug Park in the City of Scranton, Pennsylvania,\\" and that additional funds were to be used for an endowment to support such an institution. Dr. Everhart continued to collect specimens and three years after his will was prepared recognized the need to build the museum during his lifetime. In 1907 he publicly announced that he would provide funds and guidance for the creation of a museum \\"for the young and old of this generation and for all of those who follow after ... for their pleasure and education.\\" Plans in the \\"modern Renaissance\\" style were made by Scranton architects Harvey J. Blackwood and John Nelson.\\"Everhart Museum is Ready for Dedication on Memorial Day,\\" The Scranton Truth (May 28, 1908), p. 5 Construction soon began and the original core building of the Everhart Museum was dedicated on Memorial Day, May 30, 1908. At that time, the Museum's collections primarily consisted of Dr. Everhart's ornithological specimens. In honor of the museum's founder, a bronze statue of Dr. Everhart and Lake Everhart were dedicated on May 20, 1911. Dr. Everhart died just five days later on May 25, 1911. Although Dr. Everhart's original plan called for \\"three buildings forming three sides of a square, one for natural history, one for science, one for art,\\" the Everhart Museum Trustees instead added two wings to the original building and wrapped the whole in a stripped classical facade.\\"Revise Plans for Addition to Museum Here,\\" Scranton Republican (June 26, 1928), p. 3. Construction was completed in 1929; the designs were by the Scranton architects David H. Morgan and Searle von Storch.\\"Museum to Open Next Month,\\" Scranton Republican (October 2, 1929), p. 9 In 1962, a new small gallery was built in the basement, where regular changing exhibits could be displayed. During the 1980s the entire upper floor of the Museum was renovated to accommodate the permanent collections and to create a suite of temporary exhibition galleries. = Governance questions (1980s-1990s) = In the late 1980s and early '90s, the question of governance was becoming an issue for the Everhart. Funding sources, e.g. The Pennsylvania Council on the Arts, questioned the efficiency of the County Judges as trustees for a public, non-profit institution. In 1910, Dr. Everhart deemed the judges as the most \\"trustworthy\\" sector of the community to govern his newly created museum. During that period, the judges as the Board of Trustees watched over the museum's operations with various degrees of interest and participation. Judges changed and the level of their time constraints and overall interest did not always formulate an atmosphere for a solid managerial foundation. Protocol precluded the judges from raising money from private parties and over the years various auxiliary groups helped in an assortment of ways to bring funding to the Everhart by holding a variety of events. Naturally, those volunteers eventually wanted to participate in determining the use of the money raised. The ideas put forth by the workers on these occasions failed to always meet the approval of the Trustees. Without any meaningful input in the museum‚Äôs operation, the motivation for continued support by disenfranchised volunteers waned and the museum become out of the focus of the region's citizens. At the time, Robert N. Lettieri, a Scranton native, and longtime supporter of the arts, was serving on the Executive Committee of the Pennsylvania Council of the Arts under Governor Robert P. Casey. The PCA panels, evaluating Everhart grant requests, questioned the anachronistic governance of the Everhart by the county judges. They felt their trusteeship was hindering the potential and progress to move forward. The PCA, as a major funder for the Everhart, anticipated that they could no longer guarantee continued support without the museum helping themselves through other funding channels. The PCA encouraged Mr. Lettieri to investigate the possibility of amending the will of Dr. Everhart in order to form a community board of directors. Mr. Lettieri approached the then-museum director, Kevin O'Brien, on the subject. Mr. O'Brien met with the judges on a regular basis, and Mr. Lettieri asked to be included in order to make a proposal to them. Without hesitation, the judges welcomed the idea and were very receptive to Mr. Lettieri's point of view. The meeting was attended by all but one of the judges, and accepted the basic premise of the presentation. They agreed to have Mr. Lettieri back the following month for a further review. Subsequently, the judges asked Mr. Lettieri form a community board from his experience with leaders in the arts and business community. The initial responsibilities of the board would be to manage the full operation of the museum for 2 years except for the approval of the budget and the engaging of the museum director. After the two-year period the judges would then evaluate the museum‚Äôs status before going to court to officially modify Dr. Everhart's will. During that period, the museum's board began to evaluate the entire operation of all museum programs and the condition of the collections and the infrastructure. The long absence of consistent leadership and funding painted a picture of deficiencies on all levels. It appeared that the museum was on the verge of closing without a resurgence of support from the entire region. At the end of the two-year period, board member Robert Munley and his firm drafted the necessary documents to be presented the Orphans Court of Lackawanna County for the amending of Dr. Everhart's will. There was no hesitation on the part of the court, and the community board officially became the trustees of the Everhart Museum. Mr. Lettieri was the Founding President of the first Community Board and served for three years. = Matisse controversy = In a controversy that aroused national attention in museum circles, in the mainstream press and among certain members of the general public,The Art Market - New York Times the Everhart tried several times during the 1990s and early 2000s to sell their lone Matisse painting Pink Shrimps. The painting had been donated in the 1960s by Adele Levy from her collection. The intent was to put well-known artists in the collections of smaller museums, and to give these museum communities an opportunity to see works otherwise not available to them. Prior to the formation of the Community Board in the early 1990s, the Everhart had a series of directors during the 1990s and early 2000s who often had no previous museum experience and no education or background in the fine arts, which resulted in years of mismanagement that put the museum in dire financial condition. The issue came to a head in 2001-02 when then-curator Bruce Lanning refused an order from the Everhart's Board of Trustees directing him to pack up the Matisse to be shipped to Sotheby's where it was to be offered in a public auction, a move that cost him his position at the Everhart. The newly created Community Board felt that, while the ownership of a Matisse gave the museum a limited amount of prestige, the museum would better serve the spirit of Ms. Levy's gift by creating an endowment from its sale to acquire a wider variety of works and exhibitions. It was an acceptable museum practice to deaccession works not consists with its current collections. With board approval, the Matisse was offered for auction at Sotheby's but did not make the reserve of $1 million. Later, a deal was struck with a private buyer for a net amount of $1 million which was placed in a separate endowment fund for acquisitions and exhibitions. The Scranton Times lamented the loss of the city's \\"masterpiece\\". =Stolen works= On November 17, 2005, two works, a Jackson Pollock painting and pop artist Andy Warhol's 1984 Le Grande Passion, were stolen in a robbery involving ladders and a careful plan of attack. Despite efforts to retrieve the works by both the FBI and the Scranton police, nothing has been returned to the museum. After the theft there was some controversy relating to the origin of the Pollock. The Everhart Museum released a statement saying museum officials believed the stolen painting was an authentic Jackson Pollock and the painting's owner lent it in good faith. The museum's insurance broker called the Pollock piece a fake after appraisers could not authenticate it. The Everhart continues to identify the painting as Pollock's 1949 Springs Winter. The lender of the work said the correct title is Winter in Springs.  Collections  The Everhart Museum's collections include approximately 20,000 objects, with roughly half focused on the humanities and including fine arts (paintings, works on paper and sculpture), ethnographic collections (Native American, Oceania, South American and Asian), ancient civilizations, African art, American folk art, local/regional history and decorative arts (Dorflinger glass is a large component of this collection). The remaining half of the collection is focused on natural science specimens, including fossils, birds, mammals, reptiles, fish, minerals, insects, shells and herbaria. The natural science collection often features in exhibit development, as the natural world is frequently the subject of artistic inspiration, and the collections are used as a resource by artists and children alike. = Natural science = The natural science collection includes regional specimens, as well as examples from environments around the world. The ornithological collection includes 2,300 specimens, many of which are on display in the Museum‚Äôs Bird Gallery. The mammal collection consists of approximately 400 specimens that include primates, regional fauna and tropical animals. The fish, reptile and amphibian collections number approximately 285 items. The Museum‚Äôs shell collection has 3,500 specimens and there are 800 pieces in the mineral collection. The fossil collection has 300 pieces, some of which are on display in the Dinosaur Gallery. The entomological collection includes approximately 300 specimens of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) and Coleoptera (beetles). In 1913, Alfred Twining, the Associate Editor of the Scranton Times and foremost botanist in the region, donated his Herbarium to the Museum that comprises 2100 specimens. = Fine art = The fine art collection consists of nineteenth-century paintings by nationally and locally recognized artists, works on paper, contemporary prints and paintings, a small collection of European paintings and classical and modern sculpture. The ancient civilizations collection (500 pieces) consists of ancient Egyptian funerary objects, Roman glass and bronze objects, sculpture, coins, seals and jewelry. The ethnographic collections (4000 pieces) include ceramics, textiles, religious objects, and arms. The African art (500 pieces) collection comprises masks, figures, arms, tools and textiles. = Americana and folk art = The Americana and folk art collection contains paintings, works on paper, sculpture, textile arts and furniture. It was in 1934 that Mr. and Mrs. John Law Robertson lent significant pieces of American Folk Art for an exhibition at the Everhart Museum. Most of these collections were later acquired in the years 1946 to 1948 and these form the base of the extensive American Folk Art collection. Mrs. Robertson (whose actual full name has been difficult to determine, since she is always referenced publicly only as \\"Mrs. John Law Robertson\\") was one of the first individuals who exclusively dedicated time and money to develop on one of the seminal collections of folk art in the country. Her enthusiasm for folk art is recorded in letters from the museum archives where she explicitly states her commitment to and passion for art that was frequently ignored by institutions exclusively dedicated to ‚Äúfine arts.‚Äù Mrs. Robertson, an area native, balked at the conventional, conservative trends of the art world in favor of what she deemed of value. Like other early folk art collectors, she sought American art outside the established halls of the Academy, understanding the intrinsic beauty, the evident craftsmanship and the inherent history of these objects. = Decorative arts = The decorative arts collection includes ceramics, glass and furniture from Asia, Europe and America. Of special interest is the Dorflinger Glass which was produced in White Mills, Pennsylvania, from 1852 to 1921. The factory, founded by Christian Dorflinger, was renowned for its cut glass and stemware. The prestige of the factory was enhanced by its reputation for fine tableware that was sought after by eight American Presidents, from Abraham Lincoln to Woodrow Wilson, and selected European royalty.

He taught at an elementary school in Bursa, preached at the Sehzade Mosque in Constantinople (now Istanbul), wrote for Filip (Philip) Efendi‚Äôs newspaper Muhbir, and worked in different positions at offices in Simav, Plovdiv, and Sofia. He was a member of the Young Ottomans and editor of its official journal. He was exiled to Kastamonu because of his writings against Ottoman Sultan Abd√ºlaziz.  Biography  Originally trained in religious sciences, Suavi was an Islamic radical who was placed in charge of the first Young Ottoman publication to appear in Europe, Muhbir. The newspaper eventually became an embarrassment to the Young Ottomans, and soon thereafter, fellow Young Ottomans Namƒ±k Kemal and Ziya Pasha requested that Suavi remove the Young Ottoman association with the publication. Suavi drifted around to various cities and grew bitter against the Young Ottomans, eventually leading him to begin publishing a periodical that lambasted both the republican Young Ottomans and the monarchist Ottoman Sultan's government alike as enemies of the people. In 1867 he settled to Paris, to escape prosecution, and stayed there until 1876. Despite his opposition to the contemporary Sultan's government, Suavi's writings showed great respect to the institution of the Sultan, which in his belief would best be filled, for the common good of the people, by an enlightened absolutist. After the conservative Abdul Hamid II became sultan, Suavi attempted a coup in 1878 in an attempt to end the increasing authoritarianism and reinstall Murad V, who had been sympathetic to liberal ideals. The coup failed and Ali Suavi was killed in the attempt.

Writings Ab≈´ Qurrah was among the earliest Christian authors to use Arabic alongside Abu-Ra'itah of Tikrit, Ammar al-Basri and Abdulmasih al-Kindi. Some of his works were translated into Greek, and so circulated in Byzantium.For those works that have survived solely in Greek, see J.P. Migne, Patrologia cursus completus, series graeca, vol. 97, coll. 1461‚Äì1610. He wrote thirty treatises in Syriac, but none of these have yet been identified.On the manuscripts of Theodore Ab≈´ Qurrah's works, see J. Nasrallah, 'Dialogue Islamo-Chr√©tien √† propos de publications r√©centes', Revue des Etudes Islamiques 46 (1978), pp. 126‚Äì32; Graf, GCAL, II, pp. 7‚Äì26; and the list in J. C. Lamoureaux, 'Theodore Ab≈´ Qurra', in Bibliographical History of Christian-Muslim Relations (Brill, 2009), p. 417-60. His writings provide an important witness to Christian thought in the early Islamic world. A number of them were edited with German translations by Georg Graf and have now been translated into English by John C. Lamoreaux.Theodore Ab≈´ Qurrah, translated by John C. Lamoreaux, Middle Eastern Texts Initiative: The Library of the Christian East, 1 (Brigham Young University Press, 2005) Ab≈´ Qurrah argued for the rightness of his faith against the habitual challenges of Islam, Judaism and those Christians who did not accept the doctrinal formulations of the Council of Chalcedon, and in doing so re-articulated traditional Christian teachings at times using the language and concepts of Islamic theologians: he has been described by Sidney H. Griffith as a Christian mutakallim.S.H.

The subjects covered were, in the main, the doctrine of the Trinity, the Incarnation, and the Sacraments, as well as the practices of facing east in prayer (rather than towards Jerusalem or Mecca), and the veneration of the cross and other images. In Ab≈´ Qurrah's Questions of Priest Musa, in the course of its first two discourses (\\"On the Existence of God and the True Religion\\") he used a thought experiment in which he imagined himself having grown up away from civilization (on a mountain) and descending to 'the cities' to inquire after the truth of religion: an attempt to provide a philosophical argument in support of Chalcedonian Christianity from first principles. Theodore also translated the pseudo-Aristotelian De virtutibus animae into Arabic from Greek for Tahir ibn Husayn at some point, perhaps around 816.Sydney H.

In July 1948, Lord Beginner emigrated to England with fellow calypsonians Lord Kitchener (Aldwyn Roberts) and Lord Woodbine (Harold Philips) in 1948. They arrived near London on the Empire Windrush, the first of many voyages conveying West Indians wishing to start a new life in Britain.

The supporting cast was composed of volunteers from Sherwood Baptist Church, and it is the second film that Sherwood Pictures has done. Shot in Albany, Georgia, the film relates an underdog story about American football from a Christian worldview. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, but made $10.2 million on a $100,000 budget. Plot In 2003, Grant Taylor (Alex Kendrick) is the head football coach at Shiloh Christian Academy, and has yet to post a winning record in his six-year tenure. After his seventh season begins with a three-game losing streak, the players' fathers begin to agitate for his firing. This is not the only problem Grant is facing; his home has a leaking roof, his appliances are breaking down, and his car is an unreliable embarrassment. Then, crushingly, he learns that he is the reason that his wife Brooke cannot become pregnant. Suffering intense emotional turmoil, Grant stays up all night praying and studying scripture. Finally he is inspired by his old football coach to create a new coaching philosophy and decides to praise God regardless of on-field results. At the same time he influences his players to give far greater effort and tells them that they can win under God's guidance. The improved attitudes of his players influence the rest of the school. From that point on, the Eagles win all their remaining regular season games and qualify for the state playoffs. A team father, grateful to Grant for his son's improved attitude and their healed relationship, anonymously gifts a pickup truck to Grant. Then in a shocking turnaround the school gives Grant a substantial raise in salary instead of firing him. The Eagles lose their playoff opener, but are declared the winner because the opponent used ineligible players. The Eagles then advance all the way to the state championship game against the three-time defending champion Richland Giants. The Giants start off strong, quickly putting 14 points on the board, but afterward, the Eagles tighten down their defenses, placing pressure on the Giants, and manage to score off of an interception as the first half ends. Realizing they cannot overpower and outrun their opponent, Grant decided to add a few trick plays to their arsenal. As the 2nd half starts, their first trick play works and they manage to tie the game, but the Giants deliberately injure their kicker, forcing backup kicker David Childers to take the spot. The Giants tack on another touchdown and a field goal before the Eagles manage to score another touchdown, and David's kick just makes it over the bar, bringing the Eagles to within 2. As the clock winds down, the Giants come to within one yard of sealing the game with a touchdown. Defensive lineman Brock Kelley is exhausted and begs for someone else to lead, but is encouraged by Grant to give him 4 more downs. Brock agrees, and the Eagles manage to get a sack, a stop, and a pass block, taking it to 4th down. Richland head coach Bobby Lee Duke, insisting on a touchdown to put the game away, calls for the Giants to go for it. However, Brock causes a fumble, and the Eagles are able to take it to the 34-yard line with 2 seconds to go. Grant, realizing again that they cannot outrun or overpower the Giants, decides to take a huge gamble, and asks for a 51-yard field goal from David, who insists that he can't kick that far. He goes out there anyway, and despite his assistant coach's warning that the kick won't go far, Duke decides to call his timeout to ice the kicker. After a rousing speech from Grant, and seeing his father Larry Childers, who is wheelchair bound, stand beyond the fence and holding his arms up, David begs for God to help him with the kick. Seemingly in response, the wind suddenly turns favorable, and Grant tells them to kick it. David makes the kick, which manages to make it just far enough for the field goal to be good, allowing the Eagles to stun the Giants and win the game. After the game, Grant tells his players that they are not inferior or lacking in ability, and that nothing is impossible with God. Later that night, Brooke reveals that she's finally pregnant, causing Grant to break down in tears of joy. Two years later, it is revealed that they have a young baby, that another one is on the way, and that the Eagles have won a second state title. Cast * Alex Kendrick as Grant Taylor * Shannen Fields as Brooke Taylor * Bill Butler as Neil Prater * Bailey Cave as David Childers * Steve Williams as Larry Childers * Tracy Goode as Brady Owens * Jim McBride as Bobby Lee Duke * Tommy McBride as Jonathan Weston * Jason McLeod as Brock Kelley * Chris Willis as J.T.

Production The movie was shot on high definition digital video tape (using the Panasonic Varicam) and transferred to film. Using real high school football teams, the football action sequences were shot by the film's director of photography, Bob Scott, who is a veteran cinematographer for NFL Films.

Reception =Critical reception= The film received mostly negative reviews from mainstream critics. According to the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 13% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 24 reviews, with an average rating of 4.14/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"The tropes of both football and evangelical movies are gracelessly on parade in this banal, insipid drama.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 38 out of 100 based on 4 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". =Box office= In its first weekend, the film opened on 441 screens nationwide in the United States. Despite such a small number of theaters, the film opened in twelfth place with $1,343,537. The film ultimately was shown in over 1,000 theaters and grossed a total of $10,243,159. The film opened in South Korea on April 16, 2010, eventually grossing $64,828. DVD sales have totaled 2.3 million units sold in 57 countries. =Rating controversy= In May 2006, the producers of Facing the Giants received notice from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) that the film would be receiving a \\"Parental Guidance Suggested\\" rating, or PG rating. The Drudge Report picked up the story on June 8, 2006, which sparked a controversy alleging that the film was being given a \\"PG\\" rating solely because of its religious theme. The New York Times, Good Morning America, Fox News, and many talk radio programs covered this story. According to the film's producers, they were told the motion picture received a PG rating because of its strong religious themes and because it elevated one religion over another. However, MPAA later explained that Facing the Giants contains football violence and also deals with the mature topics of infertility and depression. The Kendrick brothers expected the PG rating because of the movie's mature themes and did not appeal the board's rating.

Anabasine is present in trace amounts in tobacco smoke, and can be used as an indicator of a person's exposure to tobacco smoke.  Pharmacology  Anabasine is a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist. In high doses, it produces a depolarizing block of nerve transmission, which can cause symptoms similar to those of nicotine poisoning and, ultimately, death by asystole.

He was also a noted travel writer, folklorist, musician, and the first musical critic in his country. Biography Born in Bucharest as the son of an Eastern Orthodox parish priest of the Enei Church, Filimon was a cantor and an autodidact. According to Ion Ghica's Letters, he was briefly employed by theater companies after his father's death in 1830, singing in a theater choir and playing the flute. In 1852, he was chosen administrator of the Enei Church, remaining in office until his death. The same year, he became a minor public official at the Faith Department in Prince Barbu Dimitrie ≈ûtirbei's Chancellery. In late 1857, Filimon made his literary debut with pieces written for the Na≈£ionalul newspaper. During the following year, he travelled to the German Confederation, and published his account as Excursiuni √Æn Germania meridionalƒÉ (\\"Voyages to Southern Germany\\"), which also included the Romanticist novellas MƒÉnƒÉstirea domenicanilor dupƒÉ colina Fiesole (later known as Mateo Cipriani) and O baroneasƒÉ de poroncealƒÉ. His experience and relative success as a journalist and critic would serve as the basis of chapters in his novels, which actually form in-depth analyses of cultural trends; he would collaborate on journals edited by Cezar Bolliac and Ion Ionescu de la Brad. During the period, he also published Nenorocirile unui slujnicar sau gentilomii de mahala (\\"The Misfortunes of a Servant or The Gentlemen on the Outskirts\\"; 1861), a rather typical depiction of servants and their lives, as well as his first collected fairy tales - Omul de flori cu barba de mƒÉtasƒÉ sau povestea lui FƒÉt- Frumos (\\"The Flower Man with Silky Beard or The Tale of FƒÉt-Frumos\\") and Omul de piatrƒÉ (\\"The Man of Stone\\"). Ciocoii vechi ≈üi noi, a novel about John Caradja, was written in 1862, and published as a volume in 1863. It became an instant success, but Filimon could not enjoy it for long after: although he continued to write for various journals, he was stricken down with tuberculosis, and died soon after.

The Commission sold salt to private merchants at a price that included a low but cumulatively substantial tax, which was passed on by the merchants at the point of sale. This basic mechanism of an indirect tax collected by private merchants supervised by government officials endured to the mid-20th century. The salt tax enabled a weak government to sustain itself; the government need control only the few regions that produced salt. Plans to end the government monopoly on salt by 2016 were announced in 2014. History Following the An Lushan Rebellion (756-763) revenues from the land tax began to fall. The equal-field system that sustained the land tax was undermined by the aristocracy and Buddhist monasteries acquiring large tracts of land, decreasing the amount of land which was taxable.Theobald, Ulrich. \\"Chinese History - Tang Dynasty Âîê (618-907)economy\\". Chinaknowledge.org. Retrieved 14 February 2010. To compensate the state found a new mechanism for the taxation of salt. In 758, Chancellor Liu Yan created a Salt and Iron Commission. Liu had already proved his worth by using impressed labor to dredge the long silted-over canal connecting the Huai and Yellow rivers; this project lowered transport costs, relieved food shortages, and increased tax revenues with little government investment. The Huai river ran through Northern Jiangsu, the location of coastal salt marshes which were the major source of salt. Liu realized that if the government could control these areas, it could sell the salt at a monopoly price to merchants, who would pass the price difference on to their customers. This monopoly price was an indirect tax which was reliably collected in advance without having to control the areas where the salt was consumed.Samuel Adrian M. Adshead. T'ang China: The Rise of the East in World History. (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004; ), p. 50. The commission formed to oversee the new scheme was headed by the salt commissioner (yantie shi), a financial specialist, which was uncharacteristic of the Tang unspecialized political administration. Effects Salt was to be sold only at regional offices by licensed producers, and then only to licensed merchants at marked up prices. The distribution by merchants ensured the effects of the policy penetrated into areas where the central government had limited authority. The merchants then passed on the high cost of salt to consumers. Peasants were most affected as they spent a higher percentage of their incomes on basic food goods. By 779, taxation of salt quickly accounted for over half of government revenues.Ebrey, Patricia, et al. \\"East Asia: A Cultural, Social, and Political History to 1800\\" (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2009) p. 85.

History =Origins= Following the creation of the Muslim Association of Canterbury, local Muslims in Christchurch initiated correspondence with other Muslim organisations in Auckland and Wellington, with an eye towards creating a national Muslim organisation and helping to develop the Halal meat trade. On 18 November 1978 the first preparatory meeting was held in Christchurch : Hajji Abbas Ali and Robert \\"Abdul Salam\\" Drake (architect of the Ponsonby mosque) came representing Auckland; whilst Hajji Salamat Khan, Dr Hajji Khalid Rashid Sandhu and Abdul Rahman Khan came from Wellington ; Palmerston North was represented by Ali Taal, a postgraduate student from Gambia. Following two meetings in Palmerston North on 6 February 1979 and Auckland on 15 April 1989, a consensus was reached and the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand (FIANZ) was formally established. Auckland resident Mazhar Krasniqi (an Albanian SS Goya refugee from Kosovo) was the inaugural president, Dr Hajji Hanif Quazi was the first Secretary-General, and Haji Hussain Sahib was made the first FIANZ treasurer. =1980s= In 1981, Sheikh Khalid Hafiz was appointed Imam of Wellington, a post he held until his death in 1999, and employed as such by the International Muslim Association of New Zealand. Soon after his arrival, he was appointed senior religious adviser to the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand. In June 1984, the Federation signed the first annual contract with the New Zealand Meat Producers Board (later the Meat Industry Association) to provide Halal certification services in exchange for a remuneration. The first contract was for $169,000 in 1984. Currently the figure is over one million dollarsFIANZ Annual Report 2012 and helps subsidise much of the Islamic activities across New Zealand. In April 1988, FIANZ held its first ever South Island AGM at the Canterbury mosque and Christchurch resident Dr Saleh Al Samahy from Saudi Arabia was elected president. A second South Island AGM was held at the mosque (in Riccarton) over 24‚Äì25 June 1989 where Dr Sandhu of Wellington was elected president and Dr Al Samahy was made vice-president. The following year a local convert to Islam, Soraiya Gilmour, was appointed FIANZ Treasurer. =Into the 21st century= In November 2005, the Federation celebrated its 25th anniversary (a year late) and Eid al Fitr in Parliament House, Wellington. The event was attended by the then FIANZ president Muhammed Javed (Zaved) Iqbal Khan (originally from Fiji), the inaugural president Mazhar Krasniqi, and a former president Dr Hajji Muhammed Ashraf Choudhary. In June 2008, the \\"FIANZ First Stakeholders Forum\\" was organised by New Zealand government civil servants at the parliament in Wellington. The theme was \\"To Build Strong New Zealand Muslim Families\\" but only a few Muslims were actually invited. Ultimately the only respected and interesting speaker was the Nigerian Dr Mustapha Farouk from Hamilton (whose name remains consistently misspelt in the FIANZ website). The following year, FIANZ organised the \\"FIANZ National Muslim Convention\\" over 24‚Äì25 October 2009 in Auckland and the theme was \\"Building Strong Muslim Families\\". This was attended by approximately 300 local Muslims. The most important speaker was Dr Mustapha Farouk and FIANZ Assistant Secretary Brent \\"Abdul Lateef\\" Smith (a Major in the New Zealand army).

In response to the Canadian alt right activists Lauren Southern and Stefan Molyneux's planned tour of Auckland in early August 2018, the FIANZ's president Hazim Arafeh sent letters to the Immigration Minister, Ethnic Community Affairs Minister, and the New Zealand Human Rights Commission urging them to bar Southern entry on the grounds that she was abusing her free speech by promoting hatred against Muslims. On 6 July 2018, the Mayor of Auckland Phil Goff announced that the Auckland Council would not allows its venues to be used to promote \\"ethnic or religious tensions\\" and divisive speech. This forced the cancellation of Southern and Molyneux's tour due to the lack of other venues.

The most serious issue centres around whether FIANZ is primarily a religious minority organisation or an ethnic minority cultural one: it has been suggested that the Federation conducts its affairs more like those found within the Developing Nations rather than a New Zealand organisation. As early as 1983 one Arab Muslim resident in Wellington dismissed FIANZ as \\"a group of Fijian labourers\\".Warren Berryman, \\"Insensitivities created halal meat difficulties\\" in The National Business Review (19 December 1983), page.13. More recently FIANZ leadership was tagged \\"..as a conservative businessmen's club of relaxed Muslims, well integrated in New Zealand society and benignly sexist.\\"Kolig, Erich, New Zealand's Muslims and Multiculturalism (2010) , page.31. Other lingering criticisms reflect cultural matters. Despite a concern with the \\"public\\" appearance of following the Sunnah, the Federation has sometimes created the impression of acting as a personal vehicle for certain office bearers. On occasion highly subjective evaluations appear to have decided some issues rather than any discernable long term goals. Questions have been raised in the past regarding appointments to posts within the Federation apparatus. There have also been criticisms directed at the close relationship between certain Federation leaders and the New Zealand Labour Party after it was disclosed that FIANZ had contributed over $10,000 to their failed 2008 election campaign.

Life and career Juergensen was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. She graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1987. Soon after, she began writing and performing for the stage in both New York and Los Angeles. Early on she was cast to co-star opposite Frank Vincent in the independent film The Afterlife of Grandpa, but turned it down to study psychology at McGill University. While at an acting and writing workshop sponsored by New York's Ensemble Studio Theater, she collaborated with Jennifer Westfeldt in writing a series of scenes produced Off-Broadway under the name \\"Lipschtick\\". The response to one of the scenes inspired them to write a film script about a bisexual woman and a straight woman who fall into a romantic relationship. The film was developed by a studio but not produced. They held script readings and sold shares to buy back the script rights and pay for the film's production. The result was the award-winning film Kissing Jessica Stein. She has written screenplays/teleplays for Miramax, Warner Brothers, ABC, VH-1 and CBS, among others. Her first foray into writing for herself as an actress was her 1996 one-woman show Letters to Ben Stein, an imaginary tale of an epistolary romance with the actor/economist. She contributed to the Tarcher/Penguin book The May Queen, a collection of essays exploring issues and experiences relevant to women in their thirties. Juergensen's film work has been honored at the Chicago International Film Festival, the Miami International Film Festival, and the Indie Spirit Awards. Her acting credits include roles in Red Roses and Petrol and Haunted Mansion. She has directed, written, and starred in a short film called The Suzy Prophecy. In addition, she is currently working on the script for a sports comedy set in the world of girls' track and shot. She appeared in The Hammer, a boxing comedy starring Adam Carolla, which Carolla and her husband co-wrote. =Personal life= Juergensen lives in the Hancock Park section of Los Angeles with her husband, Fox Sports columnist and comedy writer Kevin Hench, and their two dogs.

Opened in 2004, it is the northwestern terminus. Traditionally all of the Metro stations in Kyiv were built in several stages including a few stations each (sometimes delivered in various segments). The Syretsky radius was started in the early 1990s, in the midst of economic hardships as a result of which, not only was it many years behind schedule it was also very slow to open new stations. Syrets was originally to be the fifth station on the radius, but as Lvivska Brama never opened and Vulytsia Hertsena was left as a provision, it became the third on the radius when it opened to the public on 14 October 2004. The station is not in the vicinity of houses, but is right next to the Syrets railway platform, and as a result most of its passengers are commuters coming from further northwestern districts of the city rather than local residents (which was its original intention). Designed by architect T. Tselikovskaya, the station is a standard design deep level pylon trivault, but the first in Kyiv to exhibit a new high-tech approach to the design of the stations, over the previous vivid decorations that were inherited from the Soviet times. As a result, the station's walls and the perfectly square pylons are faced with grey marble, and the floor with red and grey granite. Contrasting to that are bright red metallic stripes that run on the lower side of the station wall and on the pylon and intervault wall of the platform and central hall. The niche between the upper vault and the pylon space is done out of beige mettaloplastic (which also has the fluorescent lighting elements) and the upper vaults are covered in plastic planes. In the far end of the central hall, is a neatly arranged artwork based on the same metallic themes. The station has a large surface vestibule on the corner between the Kotovsky and Stetsenko/Schuseva streets (the latter changes name as it passes under the railway flyover). A four-escalator descent connects it to the station hall. Presently the station's terminus status is meant to be temporary, and by 2015 the line should continue to expand, finally reaching the northwestern edge of the city with at least three more stations.

Design and development In the mid-1980s, the American government agency DARPA, developed a concept for a tandem wing STOL transport, intended to act as a technology demonstrator and to meet a requirement for a long-range high-speed transport for US special forces, intended to fill the gap between helicopters and larger transport aircraft such as the C-130 Hercules. In 1986, DARPA placed a contract with Scaled Composites, a company set up by Burt Rutan and owned by Beechcraft to build prototypes for advanced aircraft, for a 62% scale proof-of-concept demonstrator for the concept, called the Advanced Technology Tactical Transport (shortened to ATTT or AT3).North Aviation Week & Space Technology October 13, 1986, pp. 28‚Äì29.Flight International January 30, 1988, p. 9. The ATTT had high-aspect ratio tandem wings, which were joined by long nacelles which carried the aircraft's engines, tractor configuration turboprops, large fuel tanks and the as well as the main undercarriage units for the aircraft's retractable tricycle landing gear. As first built, it had a conventional, cruciform tail. A novel arrangement of eight fast acting fowler flaps was fitted, inboard and outboard of the engines on each of the wings. These would be extended rearwards in a low-drag configuration prior to commencing the take-off run then quickly lowered to increase lift at the point of take-off.

Career at The Dial  Watson was directly involved in the Modernist literary movement in America through his association with the modernist little magazine, The Dial. His sojourn at The Dial began as an editorial reader while Francis Browne owned the magazine, but Watson's role grew far more substantial when Scofield Thayer approached him in 1918 with an invitation to co-purchase The Dial from financially strapped owner Martyn Johnson. Their joint venture produced its first issue in January 1920 and featured works by friends of Thayer and Watson such as Cummings and Gaston Lachaise. Though Thayer was officially editor and Watson was president, Watson in reality served as co-editor from 1920‚Äì1929 when the magazine ended. In addition to his editorial duties, Watson also published in The Dial, either anonymously or as \\"W.C. Blum\\" This pseudonym was a tribute to William Carlos Williams, whom Watson admired and championed despite Thayer's disagreement.Willis. Watson also translated foreign pieces for the magazine, including Rimbaud's A Season in Hell.The Little Magazine: A History and a Bibliography After Thayer suffered a nervous breakdown and Marianne Moore took his place as editor in 1926, Watson assisted Moore and kept in contact with Thayer. Under the expert editorship of these three figures, The Dial developed into one of the most influential magazines in American Modernism.  Film career  = Avant-garde films = In the waning years of The Dial and especially after it ceased publication, Watson became increasingly interested in experimental short films. The first film he completed was Nass River Indians (1928), a 17-minute ethnographic film originally distributed in Canada and recently reconstructed.Canadian newspaper film reconstruction notice: http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/013/013-358-e.html Further Reading: Lynda Jessup, \\"J.S.

Later life  Watson continued his work as a medical doctor and philanthropist after his work at The Dial and in motion pictures. During World War II he resumed his medical career, specializing at first in gastrointestinal studies. The first color photographs of the stomach's interior have been credited to him. He proceeded to join Rochester's team of radiologists in the 1940s, which inspired his x-ray motion pictures.Screening the Body: Tracing Medicine's Visual Culture, 138. Watson also continued correspondence with many of the figures whom he met during his days at The Dial and during his film career, including Cummings, Kenneth Burke and Alec Wilder. In 1978, he donated \\"The Hildegarde Lasell Watson Collection of Artworks by E.E. Cummings\\" to the College at Brockport, State University College of New York. In the 1980s, Watson founded a private press, the Sigma Foundation, with Dale Davis to publish several authors who had appeared in The Dial.Dale Davis Blog Entry: http://www.thebakerypoetry.com/this-and-that- publishing-djuna-barnes/ The press published works of Mina Loy, Djuna Barnes, and Margaret Anderson.

Typical items found in a junk box are electronic components such as resistors and capacitors as well as small parts such as screws, nuts and bolts. A junk box may also contain surplus, cast off or used electronic gear. Radio amateurs who construct their own equipment, known as homebrewers, often have large or well stocked junk boxes. Description and uses According to some hams, a well- stocked junk box is a requirement for anyone who likes to build, repair, or tinker with radio equipment and electronic gear. Keeping an ample supply of spare electronic components provides the ham with parts to build a variety of electronic projects, as well as \\"spares\\" of components needed for repairs. Resistors, capacitors, transistors, meters, speakers, wire, cable, and even small mechanical parts such as screws, nuts and bolts are typical junk box items. Cannibalizing or removing parts from old equipment is sometimes the only way for an individual to obtain some types of parts, either because they are no longer made, or can only be ordered in large quantities. Cast-off or used electronic equipment make especially good additions to a junk box. What non-hams may see as junk, hams often see as treasure. Hamfests, surplus stores, electronic swapmeets and even dumpster diving are often venues for hams to trade, buy, scrounge, or salvage spare parts and components. Junk boxes can range in size from small cardboard or plastic boxes, to large collections that fill garages and outbuildings. Many hams derive satisfaction from having an especially large junk box full of exotic and hard-to-find components. Others feel that the act of tracking down parts is half the fun. Use in homebrewing Homebrewing is a slang term in amateur radio referring to building an alternative to a commercially available piece of equipment or accessory by hand. \\"Homebrewers\\" often naturally maintain a sizeable junk box, and amateur radio publications have often employed the term in DIY project articles such as \\"The 'Junker' Amplifier\\" from QST, Oct 1970, an RF amplifier built from scrounged and junk-box parts.

Perhaps its crowning achievement was its victory in April 1864 at the Battle of Mansfield. On June 17, 1864, Maj. Gen. John G. Walker was ordered to relieve General Taylor of command of the Army of Western Louisiana, as Taylor had been promoted to Lieutenant General and sent to the larger Army of Tennessee.

They are ultimately based on the tradition of the Chronographia of Theophanes the Confessor (d. 818), translated into Latin in the 9th century by Anastasius Bibliothecarius, which contained a chapter on the life of Muhammad. The earliest original Latin composition is Eulogius of C√≥rdoba (c. 857).Stella (2008), p. 120. While Latin biographies of Muhammad in the 11th to 12th century are still in the genre of anti-hagiography, depicting Muhammad as an heresiarch, the tradition develops into the genre of picaresque novel, with Muhammad in the role of the trickster figure, in the 13th century. The Vita Mahumeti by Embrico of Mainz (Embricho Moguntinus) is an early example of the genre. The text is in rhyming leonine hexameters, extending to 1,148 lines. It was modelled on the verse hagiography of contemporaries such as Hildebert of Le Mans. It was most likely written between 1072 and 1090. The author of the Vita has been identified with the future provost of Mainz Cathedral, Embricho II by Rotter (1994). Embrico's text is roughly contemporary with the Dei gesta per Francos by Guibert of Nogent. Both texts are the tradition of the biography the Chronographia of Theophanes, including the account of Muhammad's epilepsy and his body being eaten by pigs after his death.Nicholas Morton, Encountering Islam on the First Crusade, Cambridge University Press (2016), p. 213. A 12th-century versions include Otia Machometi by Gautier de Compi√®gne (c. 1155) and Vita Machometi by Adelphus-Ed. B. Bischoff, \\"Ein Leben Mohammads (Adelphus?)

Created by Ken Fitch and Bernard Baily, his first appearance was in Action Comics #1 (June 1938), the same comic that introduced Superman. Fictional character biography Thompson is originally a blond- haired Texas boy who leaves a possible future as an oil baron to pursue a more adventurous lifestyle with his friend, Bob Daley. This changes in issue #33 (Feb 1941) when the Nazis sink an American liner carrying food to Europe. Thompson is watching over this liner and is believed dead. The disaster inspires him to don a patriotic costume, dye his hair black, and wield a whip to fight for his country as Mr. America. As Mr. America, Thompson also had a flying carpet which doubled as a cape.Unofficial Mister America Biography His friend Bob Daley dons a homemade costume (similar to that of the original Red Tornado) and becomes his sidekick, Fat Man, wielding a broom against the forces of evil. According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, Mr. America \\"explores lost cities, fights ape armies, woos the Queen of the Malays, has a recurring nemesis in the person of the cyclopean Yellow Peril Gorrah, fights zombies, island demons, spies, the half-German, half-Japanese dwarf \\"master of assassination\\" Dr. Ito, and the female crime lord Queen Bee, and he kills lots of Germans and Japanese during the war\\". Bob's daughter, Janice, also adventured with the heroes under the secret identity of Miss X. =Americommando= Mr. America was a member of the All- Star Squadron, but his main contribution to the war effort came later; Thompson is asked by President Roosevelt himself to go battle the Nazis in Germany as The Americommando. Thompson does this by becoming \\"Hauptmann Riker\\" and infiltrating the Gestapo. His most frequent adversaries are Mister Ito (also known as The Little One), a German/Japanese diminutive assassin, and The Queen Bee. He works for the Americans for several years behind enemy lines.Cosmic Teams: All-Stars His last appearance as The Americommando is in The Justice Society Returns: National Comics #1: Mr. Terrific encounters Thompson during the bombing of Dresden and the two work together to save innocent German lives. After Thompson reveals to Mr. Terrific that there are no munitions factories in Dresden for the Allies to bomb, Thompson enters a burning building to save a small girl. The building collapses around him and he is never seen again. =Hero Hotline= Once again Thompson managed to escape death; he later emerges to create the Hero Hotline organization. While leading this organization, Thompson goes by the name The Coordinator. He only appeared as a shadowy figure on a communication screen, so no one knew that it was Thompson until it was revealed by the writer of Hero Hotline, Bob Rozakis.It's BobRo, the Answer Man! Powers and abilities Tex Thompson has no superpowers but he is a well-trained spy and a great hand-to-hand combatant. He sometimes used a whip as his main weapon and a carpet that he altered with chemicals which allows him to fly and doubles as a cape when not in use. Other versions *In Freedom Fighters #7 (March 1977), the villainous Silver Ghost poses as a fictional Americommando, leader of the Crusaders (a parody of Captain America and the Invaders). This version of the character was the inspiration for the Earth-8 version and the modern Freedom Fighters villain. *In Lord Havok and the Extremists #1‚Äì6, the Earth-8 version of Americommando is leader of a group called the Meta-Militia, an analogue of the Avengers. *In Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters, a new Americommando appears as an agent of S.H.A.D.E. and its field leader. He kills his own speedster, Spin Doctor, for talking back to him. *In Kingdom Come, an Americommando appears as a minor villain. After the destruction of Kansas, Americommando, along with Braintrust and the Minutemen, attempts to stop all immigration to the United States. He and his team are stopped by Superman and the Justice League. *In Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #1, a new Mr. America‚ÄîTrey Thompson, an ex-FBI agent who took justice into his own hands‚Äîdebuts in the first issue and dies in the same issue. It is implied by Dr. Mid-Nite that Trey was related to the original Mr. America, when Mid-Nite says that Mr. America's bloodline was gone. However, Trey's former FBI contact, Jeffrey Graves, is later seen donning Mr. America's mask after he is fired when his connection with Trey is discovered.Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #1‚Äì4: 'The Next Age' He later joins the Justice Society, and remains an active member. He also uses a whip, which is later upgraded by Mister Terrific so that the tip explodes on impact.Justice Society of America (Vol. 3) #34 *Tex Thompson played a central role in the Golden Age miniseries. In this story, he is a crime-fighter who disappeared from the American eye in 1942 to fight the Nazi threat from within. He kills the German superhero Parsifal and Adolf Hitler himself. He returns to America as a hero and becomes a senator with presidential aspirations. Then he organizes a program to defend America from the Soviet menace with a new group of superheroes. He rallies The Atom, Robotman, and Daniel Dunbar to his cause. He uses a group of scientists to transform Dunbar into Dynaman, \\"a super-hero for the new age\\". The heroes of the story discover that Tex Thompson had actually been killed in the war; the man who returned was the Ultra-Humanite. The Ultra-Humanite told Hitler that Thompson was a spy, so they killed Thompson and put Ultra's brain into his body. The experiment which created Dynaman was in reality the Humanite putting Hitler's brain in Dunbar's body. The Ultra-Humanite is stopped by Manhunter, who had witnessed the operation, but suffered from memory loss after hitting his head trying to escape.

The film is an extension of the On Cinema at the Cinema universe, in which Heidecker portrays a fictionalized version of himself who reviews movies with fellow comedian Gregg Turkington; the film follows Heidecker as he runs for the office of San Bernardino County district attorney, attempting to unseat the incumbent D.A. that previously attempted to imprison him in a mass murder charge. The film has received mixed reviews from critics. Plot Tim Heidecker is the host of the web series On Cinema at the Cinema, where he and a cast of guests review films. After transitioning to being an electronic musician and hosting a music festival, he faces murder charges when 20 people overdose and die at the event and an additional 156 are hospitalized. He ends up beating the charge with a hung jury mistrial and sets out to become district attorney of San Bernardino County, despite not being an attorney or a resident of San Bernardino and to take revenge on Vincent Rosetti, the prosecutor of his case. The film begins with a small crew following Heidecker going door to door to drum up enough signatures for him to be on the ballot as a third party candidate. He works with his campaign manager Toni Newman, who was also the sole juror to not find Heidecker guilty at his murder trial. The duo have an ad campaign made up of social media posts and yard signs mocking Rosetti as a rat and Heidecker briefly confronts him on camera before the D.A. drives away with no comment. Heidecker starts to crack under the pressure, excessively drinking and using the TCH vape system that previously addicted him and was responsible for killing the youth at his music festival. Newman attempts to get press coverage that falls through at the last minute, fails to buy an ad in the local paper on time, and attempts to stage a debate where neither of Heidecker's opponents attend. Among the six crowd members is Heidecker's frequent guest host from On Cinema at the Cinema, Gregg Turkington. Turkington reaches out to the film crew to convince them to abandon the project and see Heidecker as a criminal and failure who has no passion for film. Heidecker has a meltdown and storms out of the event. Even though he and Newman forge several signatures, his name does not appear on the ballot and Rosetti is re-elected. In a drug-induced haze, Heidecker calls Rosetti from the hotel room that doubles as his campaign headquarters and starts out gracefully conceding and offering congratulations before devolving into insults and threats. He passes out and the next day, he takes the crew to the condemned site of the music festival, where he creates a makeshift memorial to the youth who died.

The acting was largely improvised from a minimal script and evolved from a prospective Web special into a full-length feature film spontaneously. While editing, the filmmakers looked for opportunities to include backstory in the documentary that would make it more accessible to viewers who were not familiar with the Web series. Setting the film in the diverse and Hispanic-heavy San Bernardino County was contrasted with Heidecker's ignorant and xenophobic policies based on the Donald Trump administration, along with his toxic masculinity. Interior filming was shot in the San Gabriel Valley. The film's world premiere was as a part of Beyond Fest 2019 at Grauman's Egyptian Theatre, with comedian Nathan Fielder moderating the event. It was released in select theaters in the United States on October 9, 2019, by Magnolia Pictures. The series was also produced in association with Cartoon Network's Williams Street, making it the second theatrically released film from Adult Swim. Reception With an average rating of 6.03 out of 10, the website's critical consensus reads, \\"Mister America misses a number of its targets, but fans of Tim Heidecker's unique brand of comedy will find moments worth savoring in this dry political satire\\". In a positive review, David Weigel of The Washington Post wrote \\"Mister America is the devastating Trump satire America deserves.\\" Writing for Variety, Peter Debruge gave the film a negative review, calling it \\"lazy\\" and writing that \\"nothing here feels like it took much effort\\", feeling disappointed by the high standard of quality that On Cinema at the Cinema set. Candice Frederick of TheWrap criticized the film for not being explicit enough in its political criticism: \\"Mister America merely underscores recognizable themes that are no less irritating in mockumentary form than they are in real life: White supremacy, miscarriages of justice and racial disenfranchisement in a community where the leaders have all but abandoned minority residents. But the film needs to say something about it rather than merely hold up a mirror to it.\\" In The New York Times, Ben Kenigsberg gave the film a mixed review, writing that it has \\"inspired moments throughout\\" but \\"face challenges of momentum\\", as \\"Tim's ignorance, insensitivity and ill-fitting tailoring aren't really good for 90 minutes of laughs\\". Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club gave the film a C+, calling it a disappointment and summarizing, \\"In the end, it comes across as an inessential entry in a canon that has often bordered on genius\\". Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, Frank Scheck gave a very negative review, saying the film has \\"nary a single genuinely funny moment\\". For The Week, both Andy Crump and Brendan Morrow gave positive assessments, with the former calling it, \\"unsettingly real\\", writing that the satire succeeds \\"too well, both for its own good and the good of the audience\\". Morrow called it one of 2019's best comedies, writing that it's \\"consistently funny\\" and a valuable expansion to the On Cinema at the Cinema universe. Scott Tobias of NPR also praised the film as a densely-insular series of in-jokes that may not be welcoming to new viewers but \\"will nonetheless survive as a fascinating artifact of the Trump era, when the rules of politics were revised to give boors and charlatans a pathway to power‚Äîeven if, like Heidecker, it's only in their own minds.\\" On Cinema at the Cinema awarded the film only a collective 3 bags of popcorn with Tim Heidecker recommending that audiences \\"avoid it at all costs\\" and Gregg Turkington, in a rare 3 bag review, calling the film \\"definitely a very, very bad and very disappointing movie.\\" See also *2018 California elections *The Shaggy D.A., a film that Turkington repeatedly compares to Heidecker's campaign References External links  Tim Heidecker for D.

Facts The plaintiffs were charged under the Business Franchise Licences (Tobacco) Act 1987 (NSW) with selling tobacco in New South Wales without a licence. The Act provided for a licence fee, which consisted of a fixed amount, plus an amount calculated by reference to the value of tobacco sold during the 'relevant period'. The 'relevant period' was defined as 'the month commencing 2 months before the commencement of the month in which the licence expires'. The plaintiffs argued that the licence fee imposed by the Act was an excise and hence invalid due to section 90 of the Constitution. Decision A slim majority of the Court (Brennan CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ) ruled in favour of the plaintiffs, adopting the broad view of an excise per Matthews v Chicory Marketing Board (Vic).. They ruled an excise was a tax on sale, production and manufacture of goods prior to consumption, applying to goods whether produced locally or not. Excises could apply to any step in dealing with the goods. The Court viewed the scheme as purely about revenue raising without a discernible regulatory element, giving it the appearance of a tax. Under this broad view, the 'licence fee' imposed by the state government was in fact an excise, which Australian states are constitutionally barred from imposing. The Court distinguished the decision from the earlier franchise fee cases (Dennis Hotels Pty Ltd v Victoria,. and Dickenson's Arcade Pty Ltd v Tasmania .) because the period of backdating (two months instead of six) and the backdating mechanism were sufficiently different. Ha also featured a strong dissent, with the minority of the Court (Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ) adopting the traditional narrow view of an excise. They rejected the Parton v Milk Board (Vic) excise definition.. The minority saw an excise as specifically a tax on the local manufacture or production of goods.

The structure was inspired by \\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\\" segment in Walt Disney's 1940 animated film, Fantasia. Mickey Mouse's gloved hand and ears underneath the hat are visible emerging from the ground. With its opening on September 28, 2001, it replaced the Earffel Tower as the park's icon in marketing material. It was used as a venue for pin trading and sales, and also served as a backdrop to many special events and shows. High School Musical Live culminated several dances from several Disney Channel shows that performed several times daily in front of the hat. Disney characters made meet-and-greet appearances around the hat throughout the day. History Built in front of The Great Movie Ride, the Sorcerer's Hat debuted on September 28, 2001 as part of the 100 Years of Magic celebration at Walt Disney World Resort. During the celebration, interactive kiosks were installed underneath the Sorcerer's Hat where guests could learn about Walt Disney's life and career. When the celebration ended in early 2003, the kiosks were removed. On May 20, 2011, the Sorcerer's Hat served as the venue for the grand opening ceremony for Star Tours - The Adventures Continue. The Sorcerer's Hat originally was going to be built outside of the park, in the space cleared for David Copperfield's Magic Underground Restaurant that ultimately was not built. Originally going to be twice the height, with two Ferris wheels as ears, and Walt Disney: One Man's Dream underneath, the plans were changed when the retail side of the park decided to fund it, reposition it at the center of the park, and repurpose it as a pin trading station. In October 2014, Disney confirmed that the Sorcerer's Hat would be removed by early 2015. The structure's removal began on January 7, 2015, and was completed on February 25, 2015.  Other versions  Roy E. Disney Animation Building Another version of the Hat is part of the Roy E. Disney Animation Building, at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California which used to hold Roy E.

Yesterland, \\"Please Remove Your Hat\\", http://www.yesterland.com/removehat.html In fiction The Sorcerer's Hat was originally the hat of Yen Sid in the \\"Sorcerer's Apprentice\\" segment in Walt Disney's 1940 animated film Fantasia. Mickey Mouse, as the Sorcerer's lazy apprentice, puts on the hat to attempt to use magic to perform his chores, but the magic grows out of Mickey's control. The Sorcerer's Hat appears throughout season 4 of Disney-produced television series Once Upon a Time, as a powerful artifact, capable of stealing powers from magic users. Queen Elsa's parents wanted the Hat to take away her ice powers, and Rumplestiltskin wanted the Hat to free himself of the control of his cursed dagger. \\"Piece of Walt Disney World History\\" Pieces of the Hat were sold as part of the pin series \\"Piece of Walt Disney World History\\".

Gonz√°lez recorded six studio albums with Los Prisioneros and five as a solo artist. He also formed the Latin electronic project Gonzalo Mart√≠nez with fellow musician Dandy Jack, which would become the precursor of the genre known as technocumbia, established with their first and only album released in 1997. It became a success in Europe's underground music circuit, mainly in Germany and United Kingdom. After his second period with Los Prisoneros, Gonz√°lez formed with his third wife the duet \\"Los Updates\\" in 2007, only to disband in 2011 after an extensive Europe tour. In 2014, with the pseudonym \\"Leonino\\", he edited for the USA market an English album called Naked Tunes. The next year he released a remix of the album called Mixed Feelings. On 7 February 2015 during a tour in Chile, he collapsed because a Cerebral Vascular Accident. He released this year the singles \\"Nada es para siempre\\" and \\"Trenes, Trenes, Trenes\\", singles of the upcoming album \\"Trenes\\". Musical biography =Dissolution of Los Prisioneros= In February 1989 Claudio Narea discovered love letters from his bandmate Jorge Gonz√°les to his wife. Jorge, also married, admitted adultery, and when Claudio had reconciled with his wife Jorge proposed a threesome. Claudio refused and the day after the refusal Jorge attempted suicide by taking himself 16 valium pills and self-injuring. In 1990 Narea left the band, and Jorge and Miguel Tapia continued with new members until 1991.Claudio Narea: El hombre que perdi√≥ todo por Los Prisioneros La Tercera, January 17, 2009. In February 1989 Gonzalez finished mixing \\"Corazones\\", their fourth and most successful album. He stayed in L.A under Gustavo Santaolalla's guidance. Back in Chile he started rehearsing for a tour with Claudio Narea and Miguel Tapia. One month beforehand Narea quit amid rumours of the love triangle, embarking on a series of interviews with the Prisioneros hating right wing press, blaming his exit from the successful trio on a \\"sell out\\" by the band. But he later decided to ghostwrite a \\"tell all\\" book with a writer from El Mercurio, the main dictatorship newspaper, an unexpected move coming from a musician until then considered a hero. In a heavily militarized Chile his juicy story got enhanced with Acid House debauchery (Gonzalez claiming to be the first Latin artist to embrace House and Techno) and colourful tales of drugs and madness. The band split and Jorge got signed by EMI UK and embarked on a successful career until he suddenly broke up a multi-million 6-album deal in order to look for musical freedom, saying goodbye to stardom for almost a decade. He became a cult figure for some and a \\"troubled\\" character to the mainstream. =Own projects= Immediately after the first Los Prisioneros's breakup, EMI offered Jorge a very costly solo record deal. Jorge signed and began work on his first solo album. The album was self-titled, it was released in 1993. The album sold well in Chile, and received moderate airplay outside of Chile as well. EMI was internally disappointed with the sales, although the album was certified platinum, the record label was expecting higher numbers. Even Jorge himself in interviews recalled that \\"during 1993 everyone was plagiarising grunge, something I was totally against\\" in reference to the short lifespan of the album's presence in the charts. Under contract, Jorge went on to record another album with EMI, \\"El Futuro Se Fue\\". Jorge was in a London studio recording the album, carefully overseeing the production himself. \\"El Futuro Se Fue\\" was the antithesis of the lavishly produced first solo album. Jorge has admitted in interviews that during the songwriting process of the album he found himself under the influence of drugs and had recently discovered the folk music of Victor Jara. The result was a mix of folk rock with a tinge of electronic sequencers in the background. EMI was disappointed with the album, nonetheless it was released in 1994. The album did not reach platinum status and has been oout of print since approximately 1995. The album is now much more highly regarded than when initially released. Similarly, while in Los Prisioneros, this happened with the album La Cultura De La Basura. Around 1995-1997, Jorge moved to New York City. Although he spent much time in studios, as well as having his own home studio, Jorge attended the Institute of Audio Research engineering school in New York City to further his audio engineering knowledge. He also worked with Dandy Jack to produce the duo \\"Gonzalo Martinez\\" which was a hit in Europe, the album is a mix of traditional cumbia music all done through electronic programs, synthesizers, and sequencers. Around this time he reunited with Miguel Tapia (former drummer of Los Prisioneros) and formed a group called Los Dioses. Argenis Brito joined in as well, and they formed a trio. The band was a vehicle to promote the \\"Gonzalo Martinez\\" album in Latin America. A couple of concerts took place in Chile and Peru and the group proved to be a short stint, nearly lasting a year. Jorge in interviews has gone on to say that the album was ahead of its time for Latin America, while he compares that in Europe the album immediately took off. In 2004 Jorge also sang lead vocals for the electronic minimal dance group Sieg Uber Die Sonne in the album \\"+1\\" which was a very well received album in Europe. In 1999, Jorge signed with Chilean label Alerce. He began work on \\"Mi Destino: Confesiones de una estrella de rock\\" after various rehab treatments in Cuba. He completely produced the album himself in his home studio. The album was released in 1999. The album was much better received than \\"El Futuro Se Fue\\" and he promoted the album through various television program appearances and performances. However, he never toured with the album even though reviews for the album were positive. The album is considered one of his most consistent albums in his solo career and is currently his last solo album under his own name. =Los Prisioneros reunion= In 2001, Jorge had a reunion with former Los Prisioneros bandmates Miguel Tapia and Claudio Narea. They agreed to put past differences aside and reunite as a band. Unlike most bands, Los Prisioneros reunited without any sponsorship from any company and promoted their own concert in the Estadio Nacional of Chile scheduled for the 30th of November, 2001. Ticket sales sold out immediately. Due to overwhelming demand, a second night was announced for December 1, 2001. Both concerts sold out within hours of their announcements. Both nights in total brought in approximately 140,000 people in attendance. This historic moment in Chilean music was documented on a two disc DVD containing footage from the concert released in 2002 along with a separate audio only two disc CD set also released in 2002. Throughout 2002 a long tour in Chile was successful and in 2003 they played in various other countries in Latin America, Spain, and the US In early 2003 they began work on a new studio album, which was released by Warner Music Latina in 2003. The album was instantly certified platinum prior to release. Reviews for the album were mixed and after more touring, Claudio Narea announced his departure from the group through their official website. Various media outlets covered the story which caused a stir in the media. Jorge announced the band would continue without Claudio and in 2004 released \\"Manzana\\" which was well received when compared to the self-titled album from 2003. A lengthy tour followed throughout 2004-2006 that included Latin America, the U.S. and Canada. Guest musicians featured Gonzalo Ya√±ez on guitars and back up vocals and Sergio \\"Coty\\" Badilla on guitars, back up vocals, and synthesizers. Initially the band was going to relocate in Mexico to in a sense \\"start over\\" as Jorge put it. Reasons for relocating were simply because of the bad press in Chile who took sides with the former guitarist Claudio Narea. Miguel Tapia and Sergio \\"Coty\\" Badilla told Jorge they would not move from Chile. Jorge understood and through their official website announced the dissolution of the band which took place in March 2006. =Los Updates= In the summer of 2006, after relocating to Mexico, D.F., Jorge along with his wife Loreto Otero formed the duo Los Updates. They began networking through Myspace and built a fan base which consists of various people around the world. Los Updates music is solely composed and produced by Jorge with Loreto providing back up vocals and playing the synthesizer for live concerts. Initially she only sang back up and was in charge of controlling the visuals on stage. The music is self described by them as minimal dance house music. They released an E.P. in Chile in the summer of 2007, and the E.P. was released in Mexico in 2008 with bonus remix tracks. In Chile, both singles from the E.P. were ranked number 1 since their debuts in the Chilean music charts. Jorge was invited to perform in the Cumbre del Rock Chileno (a huge festival featuring over 40 bands) in 2007 by himself in Chile, and negated rumors of a possible Los Prisioneros reunion. He performed a 20-minute set by himself in front of approximately 40,000 people with only a Fender Telecaster strapped on. He later went on to perform on a few dates (again, by himself) of a small festival tour called Garage Music festival which featured a few national Chilean rock bands. In 2008, Jorge decided to organize a short tour in Chile similar to his appearance in the Cumbre del Rock Chileno which was regarded in the press as one of the highlights of the festival. Around this time he was dubbed by various media outlets as the \\"Father of Chilean Rock\\" a title which Jorge has called flattering but at the same time nothing he's taking too seriously. The tour proved to be successful and promised to release a CD and DVD documenting the concerts. He appeared in a few television programs during the tour and claimed to have organized the tour in order to get out the idea of playing by himself in small venues before he lost the momentum to do so. He announced that with the tour over, he would go to work with Los Updates full-time and on September 22 a full-length studio album was released in Europe and was imported to the U.S. on September 30. Los Updates disbanded in 2012.

The battle was fought after both the Battle of Fort Bisland and the Battle of Irish Bend. On October 9, 1863 a skirmish with Confederate & Federal cavalry occurred at the same location. Prelude After Nathaniel Prentice Banks had outmaneuvered Richard Taylor's Army of Western Louisiana out from the Bayou Teche region, he continued his movements towards his main objective of Alexandria, Louisiana. The Confederates were trying to slow him down as much as they could and they once again tried slowing him down right outside of Vermillion Bayou. Battle Map of Vermilion Bayou Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. As Richard Taylor's small army was withdrawing up the Teche, they crossed a bridge going over Vermillion Bayou. In order to slow Banks' army down, Taylor's men lit the bridge on fire and stopped for a rest. Banks, who was in pursuit of Taylor, split his army into two columns and sent one towards the bridge and the other column around the side. As soon as the first column came within sight of the bridge, Confederate artillery began shelling the Union soldiers. After a while, Union artillery came up and a series of counter-battery exchanges ensued. During the night, Taylor, knowing himself to be outnumbered, withdrew his force again. Aftermath Though Taylor had not dealt Banks a defeat, he was continually slowing Banks down from reaching Alexandria, Louisiana, and his ultimate objective of Port Hudson, Louisiana.

Andrew Lang included it in The Blue Fairy Book.Andrew Lang, The Blue Fairy Book, \\"The Brave Little Tailor\\" The tale was translated as Seven at One Blow.Wiggin, Kate Douglas Smith; Smith, Nora Archibald. Tales of Laughter : A Third Fairy Book. New York: McClure. 1908. pp. 138-145. Another of many versions of the tale appears in A Book of Giants by Ruth Manning-Sanders. It is about a humble tailor who tricks many giants and a ruthless king into believing in the tailor's incredible feats of strength and bravery, leading to him winning wealth and power.  Origin  The Brothers Grimm published this tale in the first edition of Kinder- und Hausm√§rchen in 1812, based on various oral and printed sources, including Der Wegk√ºrzer (ca. 1557) by Martinus Montanus.Cosquin, Emmanuel. \\"Contes populaires lorrains recueillis dans un village du Barrois √† Montiers-sur-Saulx (Meuse) (suite)\\". In: Romania, tome 5 n¬∞19, 1876. pp. 350-354. [DOI:https://doi.org/10.3406/roma.1876.7128] ; www.persee.fr/doc/roma_0035-8029_1876_num_5_19_7128 Synopsis The tailor prepares to squash the flies. Illustration from Andrew Lang's The Blue Fairy Book (1899). A tailor is preparing to eat some jam, but when flies settle on it, he kills seven of them with one blow of his hand. He makes a belt describing the deed, reading \\"Seven at One Blow\\". Inspired, he sets out into the world to seek his fortune. The tailor meets a giant who assumes that \\"Seven at One Blow\\" refers to seven men. The giant challenges the tailor. When the giant squeezes water from a boulder, the tailor squeezes milk, or whey, from cheese. The giant throws a rock far into the air, and it eventually lands. The tailor counters the feat by tossing a bird that flies away into the sky; the giant believes the small bird is a \\"rock\\" which is thrown so far that it never lands. Later, the giant asks the tailor to help him carry a tree. The tailor directs the giant to carry the trunk, while the tailor will carry the branches. Instead, the tailor climbs on, so the giant carries him as well, but it appears as if the tailor is supporting the branches. Impressed, the giant brings the tailor to the giant's home, where other giants live as well. During the night, the giant attempts to kill the tailor by bashing the bed. However, the tailor, having found the bed too large, had slept in the corner. Upon returning and seeing the tailor alive, the other giants flee in fear of the small man. The tailor enters the royal service, but the other soldiers are afraid that he will lose his temper someday, and then seven of them might die with every blow. They tell the king that either the tailor leaves military service or they will. Afraid of being killed for sending him away, the king instead attempts to get rid of the tailor by sending him to defeat two giants along with a hundred horsemen, offering him half his kingdom and his daughter's hand in marriage if the tailor can kill the giants. By throwing rocks at the two giants while they sleep, the tailor provokes the pair into fighting each other until they kill each other, at which time the tailor stabs the giants in their hearts. John Batten for Joseph Jacobs's Europa's Fairy Book (1916). The king, surprised the tailor has succeeded, balks on his promise, and requires more of the tailor before he may claim his rewards. The king next sends him after a unicorn, another seemingly impossible task, but the tailor traps it by standing before a tree, so that when the unicorn charges, he steps aside and it drives its horn into the trunk. The king subsequently sends him after a wild boar, but the tailor traps it in a chapel with a similar luring technique. Duly impressed, the king relents, marries the tailor to the princess, and makes the tailor the ruler of half the original kingdom. The tailor's new wife hears him talking in his sleep and realizes with fury that he was merely a tailor and not a noble hero. Upon the princess's demands, the king promises to have him killed or carried off. A squire warns the tailor of the king's plan. While the king's servants are outside the door, the brave little tailor pretends to be talking in his sleep and says \\"Boy, make the jacket for me, and patch the trousers, or I will hit you across your ears with a yardstick! I have struck down seven with one blow, killed two giants, led away a unicorn, and captured a wild boar, and I am supposed to be afraid of those who are standing just outside the bedroom!\\" https://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm020.html Terrified, the king's servants leave. The king does not try to assassinate the tailor again and so the tailor lives out his days as a king in his own right.  Analysis  In the Aarne‚ÄìThompson‚ÄìUther system of folktale classification, the core of the story is motif type 1640, named The Brave Tailor for this story. It also includes episodes of type 1060 (Squeezing Water from a Stone); type 1062 (A Contest in Throwing Stones); type 1052 (A Contest in Carrying a Tree); type 1051 (Springing with a Bent Tree); and type 1115 (Attempting to Kill the Hero in His Bed). \\"The Brave Little Tailor\\" has close similarities to other folktales collected around Europe, including \\"The Boy Who Had an Eating Match with a Troll\\" (Norway) and \\"Stan Bolovan\\" (Romania). It also shares many elements with \\"Jack the Giant Killer\\" (Cornwall and England, with ties to \\"Bluebeard\\" folktales of Brittany, and earlier Arthurian stories of Wales), though the protagonist in that story uses his guile to actually kill giants. Both the Scandinavian and British variants feature a recurring stock character fairy- tale hero, respectively: Jack (also associated with other giant-related stories, such as \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\"), and Askeladden, also known as Boots. It is also similar to the Greek myth of Hercules in which Hercules is promised the ability to become a god if he slays the monsters, much like the main character in \\"The Brave Little Tailor\\" is promised the ability to become king through marrying the king's daughter if he kills the beasts in the story. The technique of tricking the later giants into fighting each other is identical to the technique used by Cadmus, in Greek mythology and a related surviving Greek folktale, to deal with the warriors who sprang up where he sowed dragon's teeth into the soil.Richard M. Dorson, \\"Foreword\\", p xxii, Georgias A. Megas, Folktales of Greece, University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1970 In the 20th-century fantasy novel The Hobbit, a similar strategy is also employed by Bilbo to keep three trolls fighting among themselves, until the rising sun turns them to stone. =Variants= Folklorist Joseph Jacobs, in European Folk and Fairy Tales (or Europa's Fairy Book) tried to reconstruct the protoform of the tale, which he named \\"A Dozen at One Blow\\".Joseph Jacobs, European Folk and Fairy Tales, \\"A Dozen at One Blow\\" Europe A variant has been reported to be present in Spanish folktale collections,Boggs, Ralph Steele.

For example, various forms of psychological manipulation to influence the behavior of others, such as turning the pair of giants against each other, and playing on the assassins' and the earlier giants' assumptions and fears. Similarly, he uses decoy tactics to lure the quest animals (unicorn, boar) into his traps, and to avoid being killed in the first giant's bed. This reliance on trickery and manipulation by the protagonist is a feature of the stock character of the antihero. * King ‚Äì this character is very mistrusting and judgmental, who uses the promise of half the kingdom to persuade the protagonist to take on seemingly deadly tasks. The king is one-dimensional as a character, and is essentially a plot device, the source of challenges for the protagonist to overcome to achieve the desired goal. * Princess ‚Äì the prize for completing all these challenges is the hand in marriage of the princess, and along with it, half the kingdom. She sets great store by the social class of royal birthright, so when she finds out that the man she has married is no more than a poor tailor, she is furious, and tries to have him killed. Her self-absorbed vindictiveness, and its easy defeat, is consistent with the stock character of the shrewish bride. Adaptations * Mickey Mouse appeared in a 1938 Disney short cartoon, Brave Little Tailor, based on this tale. * Tibor Hars√°nyi composed a suite, L'histoire du petit tailleur, for narrator, seven instruments, and percussion in 1950. One of the most famous recordings of this work was performed by the Orchestre de la Soci√©t√© des Concerts du Conservatoire conducted by Georges Pr√™tre, with Peter Ustinov as the narrator reading in both English (Angel Records, 1966) and French (Pour les Enfants, EMI Classics France, 2002). * The story formed an episode of the second season of Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics, a 1987‚Äì1989 anime television series. * The Valiant Little Tailor was featured in the first seasons of Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child, a 1995‚Äì2000 HBO animated TV series, where it was set in the West African Sahel. The tailor was called Bongo and was voiced by David Alan Grier and also featured the voice talents of James Earl Jones as King Dakkar, Mark Curry as the Giant, Dawnn Lewis as Princess Songe, and Zakes Mokae as an exclusive character named Mr. Barbooska. * Le vaillant petit tailleur is a 2004 French-language novel by √âric Chevillard retelling the fairy tale in a postmodernist way. * \\"Satmaar Palowan\\" (\\"The Wrestler Who Kills Seven\\"), a short story by eminent Bengali writer Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury, was inspired by this tale. * A Soviet cartoon based on the fairy tale was produced in 1964, directed by the Brumberg sisters. * In the game Fairy Tale Fights, he acts as the main antagonist who is stealing all the fame and glory from four fable characters (Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Jack, and The Naked Emperor) by stalking them throughout the game and lets them do all the life-threatening hardwork before swooping in after every victory to steal the prize and claim the credit for himself. eventually his fame was short-lived after the heroes defeated him and exposed his storybook to the fairytale village that he's a fraud, The Tailor tried to escape but was flattened and killed by the father giant who drop the heroes books on top of him and taken his book, this resulted of the heroes fame finally restored and the villagers cheering them on.

They first appeared in their own miniseries published in 1995. They were created by Grant Morrison, Mark Millar and Steve Yeowell. The group are humans modified by eating Skrull-infected beef. Some of the team returned during the Skrulls' Secret Invasion, which led to another miniseries. Publication history The team first appeared in their own eponymous series written by Grant Morrison and Mark Millar, published in 1995. It was one of Tom Brevoort's first projects and came about when Morrison and Millar faxed the Marvel offices looking for work: The original idea for the team name was the Skrull Kill Kult, based on the band Thrill Kill Kult, but Marvel's Editor-in-Chief Tom DeFalco objected to the use of \\"Kult\\" because \\"he felt that it made the series seem like too much of an endorsement of murder cults\\". Brendan McCarthy designed the characters and Steve Yeowell was brought on board to provide the pencils, the same division of labor on Morrison's Zenith, because of \\"a lukewarm reception to Steve's initial visualizations\\". The series was originally announced as an ongoing series. However, it was changed to a miniseries, because of wider problems in the American comic book market in the mid-1990s and changes at Marvel, with DeFalco leaving. There were four issues worth of scripts done at the time and Brevoort managed to argue for a fifth to close the miniseries. They then made an appearance in Avengers: The Initiative #16 as one of the Secret Invasion tie-ins and writer Dan Slott announced at the 2008 Baltimore Comic-Con that they would be getting a new miniseries featuring the new line-up.Baltimore: Cup of B Panel, Comic Book Resources, September 27, 2008 It was a five-issue miniseries written by Adam Felber, and saw the original team brought back together to fight the descendants of the original Skrull-cows.Adam Felber - Hangin' With the Skrull Kill Krew, Newsarama, February 10, 2009 Fictional team biography The Fantastic Four, at the beginning of their superhero careerFantastic Four #2 defeated a group of Skrull spies. Reed Richards brainwashed them into becoming cows and retaining that form for life. The Skrull-cows at one point regained their memories and Skrull forms in the Kree-Skrull War,Avengers #89-97 leading to the death of one of them. The other three were turned over to the U.S. government and restored to cows in form and mind. The milk from these cows affected the inhabitants of a small dairy town named King's Crossing, giving them shapeshifting powers. The Fantastic Four, via a girl that Johnny Storm was dating at the time, ended up investigating the town and neutralizing the threat.Fantastic Four Annual #17 They were then (apparently by accident) shipped to a slaughterhouse and butchered as beef. Some of the meat eaten by people transferred the Skrull's adaptable DNA code into the humans' cells, resulting in a bizarre condition called Skrullovoria-Induced Skrullophobia, in which these individuals not only gained shapeshifting powers equal to, or greater than, actual Skrulls, but also developed an intense fear or hatred of Skrulls. Only a small number of humans proved susceptible to this syndrome, and most did not survive the initial stages of infection. But several people who proved somewhat longer-lived (though still dying) were gathered together by a man known only as Ryder, who was himself a victim of the disease, to act out their increasingly irrational impulses to seek out and destroy the ones who did this to them (by \\"letting\\" themselves get turned into cows), usually by graphically \\"blowing away\\" the Skrulls with high-powered weapons. Their desire to kill Skrulls not only stopped many plots which endangered humans, it also led them to fight other well-known Marvel characters, such as Baron Strucker and Captain America. =Secret Invasion= Ryder and Riot return to ferret out more Skrulls. The other three are still alive, their heads kept in jars, as their Skrull infestation has resulted in the loss of their bodies.Avengers: The Initiative #18 They encounter the new 3-D Man in the New Mexico desert and save him from a Skrull posing as the 'She-Thing'. The 3-D Man joins them in rooting out Blacksmith of the Desert Stars, another Skrull, and killing him as well.Avengers: The Initiative #16 They were next seen helping Nevada's Fifty State Initiative team, the Heavy Hitters deal with a Skrull posing as an unnamed team member. They found out that in every Initiative state team is one Skrull-impostor and decided to kill them all. Komodo and her lover Hardball both join with the team as well. The Skrull Kill Krew thought they would not be able to track Skrulls through all the states on time, but then former Avenger Jocasta appeared with Devil-Slayer, who is a member of the Hawaiian Initiative team, the Point Men. Devil-Slayer has teleportation powers, thus allowing the group to speed up their plans.Avengers: the Initiative #17 Most Skrull-killing incidents end with a few more ad-hoc recruits. Later, Ryder reveals that he still has the heads of Moonstomp, Dice and Catwalk, who can also track down Skrulls. He gives the three heads to speedsters Whiz Kid, Spinner and Nonstop. The team splits up in six different squads, each one to search for the six remaining Skrull sleeper agents within the Initiative teams. Also, they are to destroy the devices within each Initiative building that could assist the Skrulls in destroying the United States. Despite multiple failures (including the death of Spinner), the devices are never set off.Avengers: the Initiative #18 After the Skrulls are defeated, Moonstomp, Dice and Catwalk's heads all die, and Riot reverts to human form, dying as well. The 3-D Man and Ryder then leave her behind and set out to find and kill any Skrulls that might still be on Earth.Avengers: The Initiative #20 Ryder is working alone, attacking nightclubs for Skrulls. Riot is revealed to have survived and is looking on Match.com for a woman. 3-D Man is not an active participant.Skrull Kill Krew (vol. 2) #1 It was later revealed that Ryder has obtained some means of reviving his former teammates via an unknown liquid. The miniseries' second issue ends with Moonstomp's head reanimating as his body begins to grow back and Ryder prepares to inform him that the current president is an African-American.Skrull Kill Krew (vol. 2) #2 Ryder succeeds in reviving Moonstomp, Dice, and Catwalk.Skrull Kill Krew (vol. 2) #3 The reunited team then faces off against the descendants of the Skrulls that were hypnotized into being cows.Skrull Kill Krew (vol. 2) #4 Following the battle against the Skrulls, Moonstomp leaves the team.Skrull Kill Krew (vol. 2) #5 It is later revealed that, in addition to cows, the Fantastic Four had transformed one of the original Skrull invaders into a duck. The duck was eaten by a young Chinese-American girl named Tara Tam, who gained superhuman abilities as a result. The members of the Skrull Kill Krew tried to recruit Tara as part of the group, but she turned them down out of fear over how her parents would react. Years later, Tara would become the partner of Howard the Duck.Howard the Duck (vol. 2) #5 Membership =Current= Writer Mark Millar signing copies of the book during an appearance at Midtown Comics in Manhattan * Ryder - Leader and founder. In addition to shapeshifting, he can teleport, has enhanced strength and reflexes, and carries many firearms. He prefers to animate his hair into snake-like tentacles. In the relaunched Skrull Kill Krew (vol. 2) #1-5, it is implied that he may be one of the Skrulls that were turned into cows who ultimately was able to grant himself a human appearance, but losing his memory in the process and believing himself a regular human affected by Skrullovoria-Induced Skrullophobia. * The 3-D Man - An African American who inherited his powers from the original 3-D Man, a 1950s anti-Skrull hero. Able to recognize Skrulls with his powers; used the original 3-D Man's glasses to focus his ability, ultimately believing them to be granted by the item, until their destruction forced him to rely on himself. * Riot - Punk rocker. Turns into an armored insectoid form. In this form she has great strength and sharp spines. Was stuck in that form for an extended period. Appeared to have died at Camp Hammond, after finally reverting to human form. It is later revealed that she survived and was working with Ryder, though grudgingly. Riot is also looking on Match.com for a lesbian dating partner, though she has trouble reverting to her human form again.Skrull Kill Krew (vol. 2) #2 * Catwalk - Former fashion model who transforms into a feline/humanoid form. In this shape she has enhanced athletic abilities, with claws and fangs. * Dice - Former surfer. He can breathe underwater and transform his limbs into weapons, which project explosive blasts. =Former= * Moonstomp - British Neo-Nazi skinhead. Hates Skrulls so much that he is willing to work with Ryder (a black man), even though he feels like he is compromising his values by doing so. He has some shapeshifting powers, but prefers to bash his foes with a normal claw hammer. During the series, his degenerative condition worsens, causing him to develop patches of dark skin, which displeases him immensely.

Translated by Wen Ha-hsiung, Chung Wu Publishing; 33, 140th Lane, Tung-hwa Street, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.  People's Liberation Army  =Armies of the PLA 1948-1985= From November 1948, the People's Liberation Army regularised the existing large number of armies and divisions into some sixty-seven armies of three divisions each. While some formations, such as the 1st Army, survived for over fifty years, a number were quickly amalgamated and disestablished in the early 1950s. It appears that over 37% (26 of 70) of the seventy new armies may have been disestablished from 1949 to 1953. In 1949, the 8th and 34th Armies were disbanded, in 1950, the 30th and 35th Armies were disbanded in January, the 51st Army on September 24, 1950, and the 29th, 32nd, and 33rd in November 1950. The 45th and 48th Armies appear to have been broken up in 1951-52; the 48th Army had the 142nd Division become the 11th Public Security Division and the 144th Division transferred to the 21st Army/Corps. The 52nd Army was broken up on September 2, 1951. In 1952, the 3rd, 4th, 9th, 10th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 25th (July 1952), 36th, 37th, 43rd, 44th, and 49th Armies were disbanded. The 36th and 37th Armies appear to have both been broken up in February 1952, and both may have been reorganised for engineering tasks. The 44th Army was broken up in October 1952 with headquarters elements possibly transferred to the Navy, the 131st Division to the Navy Qingdao Base and the 132nd Division to the 43rd Army. The 49th Army was broken up in January. It appears that the 2nd and 6th Corps were disbanded in 1953. The 5th Army/Corps was reorganised into a military region in October 1954. After the Landing Operation on Hainan Island, the 43rd Army merged with the Hainan Military Region on July 5, 1952. In September 1968 the 43rd Army was reformed, including the 127th Division, the 128th Division, the 220th Division (renamed the 129th Division on September 19, 1969), to defend Guangxi Guilin. On October 17, 1969, it moved to Henan Luoyang, changed to Wuhan Military Region leadership (129th Division left Guiyang \\"support left\\", in January 1973 to build). Zhang Wannian became corps commander in 1981. In October 1985, the 43rd Army was disbanded again. The 127th Division transferred to the 54th Army, and the 128th Division to the 20th Army. The 129th Division was disbanded. In March 1967, the Central Intelligence Agency identified some 35 field corps:Central Intelligence Agency, National Intelligence Estimate No. 13-3-67 Communist China's Military Policy and its General Purpose and Air Defense Forces, 6 April 1967 , page 28 of 34 *Shenyang Military Region: 16th, 23rd, 38th, 39th, 40th, 46th, 50th, 64th. *Beijing Military Region: 21st, 24th, 63rd, 65th, 66th Army, 69th. *Jinan Military Region: 26th, 67th, 68th Army. *Nanjing Military Region: 12th, 20th, 22nd, 27th Army, 60th Army. *Fuzhou Military Region: 28th Army, 31st Army. *Guangzhou Military Region: 41st, 42nd, 43rd, 47th, 55th. *Wuhan Military Region: 1st, 10th Airborne (part of the PLAAF), 15th. *Kunming Military Region: 13th Army, 14th Army. *Chengdu Military Region: 54th Army. *Inner Mongolia, Lanzhou, Tibet, and Xinjiang Military Regions had no armies located within them.

She was the first scientist to clone HIV and determine the function of its genes, which was a major step in proving that HIV is the cause of AIDS. From 1990 to 2002, she held the Florence Riford Chair in AIDS Research at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). She was co-founder and, after retiring from UCSD, she became the chief scientific officer of Immusol, which was renamed iTherX Pharmaceuticals in 2007 when it transitioned to a drug development company focused on hepatitis C, and continued as chief scientific officer.  Early life  Wong-Staal was born as Wong Yee Ching in Guangzhou, China, in 1946. In 1952, her family was among the many Chinese citizens who fled to Hong Kong after the Communist revolution in the late 1940s. During her time in Hong Kong, Wong attended Maryknoll Sisters School, where she excelled in science. Although no women in her family had ever worked outside the home or studied science, her parents supported her academic pursuits. Throughout her time at the school she was encouraged by many of her teachers to further her studies in the United States. Her teachers also suggested she change her name to something in English. Her father chose the name \\"Flossie\\" for her after a massive typhoon that had struck Southeast Asia around this time.  Education  At age of 18, she left Hong Kong to attend the University of California, Los Angeles, where she pursued a B.S. in bacteriology. She was graduated cum laude in just three years. After earning her bachelor's degree, she went on to earn a Ph.D. in molecular biology from UCLA in 1972. She conducted her postdoctorate work at the University of California, San Diego, where she continued to research. HIV cloning Her postdoctoral work continued until 1973, when she moved to Bethesda, Maryland, to work for Robert Gallo at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). At the institute, Wong-Staal began her research into retroviruses. In 1983, Wong-Staal, Gallo, and her team of NCI scientists identified HIV as the cause of AIDS, simultaneously with Luc Montagnier. Two years later, Wong-Staal became the first researcher to clone HIV. She also completed genetic mapping of the virus which made it possible to develop HIV tests. This led to the first genetic map of the virus, which aided in the development of blood tests for HIV.  Research  In 1990, Wong-Staal was recruited from NCI to the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), where she started the Center for AIDS Research. Wong-Staal continued her research into HIV/AIDS at UCSD. Wong-Staal's research focused on gene therapy, using a ribozyme \\"molecular knife\\" to repress HIV in stem cells. The protocol she developed was the second to be funded by the United States government. In 1990 a team of researchers led by Wong-Staal studied the effects that the Tat protein within the viral strain HIV-1 would have on the growth of cells found within Kaposi's sarcoma lesions commonly found in AIDS patients. The team of researchers performed tests on a variety of cells that carried the Tat protein and observed the rate of cell proliferation in cells infected by HIV-1 and the control, a culture of healthy human endothelial cells. Wong-Staal used a type of cellular analysis known as radioimmunoprecipitation in order to detect the presence of KS lesions in cells with varying amounts of the Tat protein. The results of these tests showed that the amount of Tat protein within a cell infected by HIV-1 is directly correlated to the amount of KS lesions a patient may have. These findings were essential in developing new treatments for HIV/AIDS patients who suffer from these dangerous lesions.  Achievements  In 1994, Wong-Staal was named as chairman of UCSD's newly created Center for AIDS Research. In that same year, Wong-Staal was elected to the Institute of Medicine of the U.S. National Academies. In 2002, Wong-Staal retired from UCSD and accepted the title of professor emerita. She then joined Immusol, a biopharmaceutical company that she co-founded with her second husband, Jeffrey McKelvy,Heidt, Amanda, Pioneering Molecular Virologist Flossie Wong-Staal Dies, The Scientist, July 14, 2020 while she was at UCSD, as chief scientific officer. Recognizing the need for improved drugs for hepatitis C (HCV), she transitioned Immusol to an HCV therapeutics focus and renamed it iTherX Pharmaceuticals.Heidt, Amanda, Pioneering Molecular Virologist Flossie Wong- Staal Dies, The Scientist, July 14, 2020 That same year, Discover named Wong- Staal one of the fifty \\"most extraordinary women scientists\\".

Life Ding Yi was from Pei State (), which is around present-day Suixi County, Anhui. His father, Ding Chong (), was an old acquaintance of Cao Cao, the warlord who controlled the Han central government and the figurehead Emperor Xian from 196 to 220. Ding Chong served as the Colonel-Director of Retainers () in Cao Cao's administration. After Ding Chong's death, Cao Cao wanted to arrange for Ding Yi to marry one of his daughters, Princess Qinghe (). However, Cao Cao's eldest surviving son, Cao Pi, strongly opposed because Ding Yi had an eye disorder which affected his physical appearance and hence made him an unsuitable spouse for Princess Qinghe. Cao Pi then suggested to his father to let Princess Qinghe marry Xiahou Mao instead; Cao Cao agreed. Ding Yi hated Cao Pi for spoiling his chance of becoming Cao Cao's son-in-law, so he grew determined to oppose Cao Pi. He became close to Cao Pi's younger brother Cao Zhi, who was Cao Pi's rival in a power struggle over the succession to their father's position as a vassal king under the Han Empire. Along with Yang Xiu and others, Ding Yi often sang praises of Cao Zhi in front of Cao Cao in the hope of helping Cao Zhi earn his father's favour. However, Cao Zhi ultimately lost to Cao Pi, whom Cao Cao officially designated as his heir apparent. Cao Cao initially assigned Ding Yi to be an Assistant Officer in the West Bureau (). After Cao Pi became the heir apparent, Ding Yi was reassigned to be a Right Assistant Security Officer (). Cao Cao noted Ding Yi's literary talent and once regretted his decision to not have Ding Yi as a son-in-law. In 220, following Cao Cao's death, Cao Pi inherited his father's position as a vassal king of the Han Empire and eventually usurped the throne from Emperor Xian later that year and established the state of Cao Wei to replace the Eastern Han dynasty. One of the first things he did after coming to power was to have Ding Yi and his entire family executed.

It depicts one man's struggle to outwit a choking bureaucracy, and come out ahead. It was first published in Astounding Science Fiction magazine in January 1959. Plot summary Sitting at a desk with a surly co-worker, processing endless forms while fat cats in the office line their own nests, is no way to end a career as a space pilot. So when one ex- spacer finds that an order for a biological irradiator, needed to help wipe out an insect plague on a colony planet, has been sidelined to make way for a shipment of gin for one of his superiors, he takes action. He invents a fictional new colony called \\"Nemo\\", and puts in a high priority order for the irradiator, meaning to re-route it to the real colony when it arrives. He forges several signatures, including his co-worker's and his own. He reasons that if anything at all gets done in the organization it's probably because people are forging signatures they'd have to wait forever to get. His deskmate just says \\"You can't beat the system.\\" The middle of the story tells the tale of how the new order progresses through the system, with officials inspecting the factory making the irradiator to see that it is indeed a real and properly patriotic business, and other officials creating official documents stating that the irradiator will indeed have the desired effect on the insects and so on and so forth. In record time, that is to say mere years, the irradiator arrives, and immediately the bureaucrats smell a rat. The ex-pilot is called to explain to his boss, to the \\"I told you so's\\" of his deskmate. He seems oddly confident, however. He explains to his boss that, yes, Nemo is not a colony. It's a code word for a \\"tentative priority\\", that is one which will apply if nothing else intervenes. When asked why he did this, he responds that certain shipments had been getting more priority than they deserve. Bit by bit he admits that the problem was the gin shipment, knowing that his boss is a mortal enemy of the gin drinker. That gets him off the hook, but then he plays his trump card. He has an idea to stop abuses by creating a tracking process which will monitor a form as it proceeds through the system. His boss is only mildly interested until told of the extra subordinates he will have to hire to implement the process. Like most bureaucrats, his status, pay, perks, and pension increase with the number of people working for him. He decides to adopt the idea for the good of the organization, and gratefully offers the ex- pilot the job of supervisor in the new department. Returning to his desk, our hero informs his surly deskmate that \\"You can beat any system. All you do is turn the handle the way it goes, only more so.\\" The response is \\"Shut up. And don't talk until you can talk sense.\\" External links Category:1959 short stories Category:Science fiction short stories Category:Works originally published in Analog Science Fiction and Fact ","title":"Study in Still Life"},{"id":"5660637","text":"The Students' Association of the University of Adelaide (SAUA) was a student representative body that existed at the University of Adelaide from 1973 until 2007.Adelaide University Union - Student Site It was one of a number of student organisations that was affiliated to and funded by the Adelaide University Union through the government sanctioned 'Union Fee'.

The film appeared on a 1992 episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. In a highly unusual admission, characters Joel Robinson and Tom Servo said the film was \\"pretty good for a Bert I. Gordon film\\" during a theater segment (though Crow T. Robot seemed to disagree). The writers of the show continued the praise in their book MST3K Amazing Colossal Episode Guide. Plot George is the foster son of Sybil, an elderly somewhat ineffectual sorceress. She brought him up after his \\"royal parents died of the plague\\" in his infancy. He has fallen in love at first sight with Princess Helene. Helene is kidnapped by the wizard Lodac, who brazenly informs her father that he intends to feed her to his pet dragon in seven days, revenge for the death of his sister at the same age as Helene is now: 18. George wants to go on a quest to liberate his lady love, but Sybil believes he is too young (he is 20). She tries to distract the youth by showing him a magic sword, a steed, an invulnerable suit of armour, and six magically frozen knights he will command when he turns 21. The impatient George, however, tricks Sybil and locks her in a cellar, then leaves with the magical implements and revived company of knights. Sir George and his party appear before the king and insist on journeying to Lodac's castle to rescue Helene, against the opposition of Sir Branton, a knight who had previously volunteered for the perilous quest. The king promises the rescuer his daughter's hand in marriage and half his kingdom. Seven curses bar the path to Lodac's castle. First, they encounter an ogre, who slays Sir Ulrich of Germany and Sir Pedro of Spain before George kills him. When George tries to save Sir Anthony of Italy from being pulled under in a swamp, Branton treacherously comes up from behind and kicks him in as well. Anthony is killed, but George survives with the help of his magic sword. Later, Branton meets secretly with Lodac. It turns out that Branton has Lodac's ring, which the magician lost and wants back desperately, as his powers are crippled without it. The kidnapping was solely intended to make Branton look good in exchange for the return of the ring. When Sir Dennis of France happens by, Lodac prepares a trap. Mignonette, a beautiful Frenchwoman, distracts her compatriot, then suddenly turns into an ugly hag who attacks him. Fortunately, George saves him with his magic shield. Lodac finally becomes aware that George is being aided by magic. He contacts Sybil and mocks her abilities. Stung, she tries to cast a spell to help George, but ends up inadvertently stripping away all his magical powers. Sir Dennis and Sir James of Scotland perish when they reconnoiter ahead. Branton then leads George and Sir Patrick of Ireland into a trap, revealing his partnership with Lodac before sealing them in a cave with deadly green apparitions. Patrick, through the power of his faith, enables George to escape at the cost of his own life. George sneaks into Lodac's castle and rescues Helene, only to be captured. The magician gives Helene (actually the hag in disguise) to Branton, but once he has the ring, he uses magic to put Branton's head on a plaque on the wall. George is tied up, but escapes with the help of escaped shrunken prisoners. Sybil arrives and finally remembers the spell that restores George's powers, enabling him to slay the two-headed dragon and save Helene. Sybil steals the ring while Lodac is distracted. When the magician threatens the young couple with the seventh curse - himself - Sybil transforms herself into a large panther and kills him. Helene and George get married. When the six knights are restored to life, George's happiness is complete.

He was the eldest son of Sun Quan, Eastern Wu's founding emperor, and was crown prince from 229 until his death in 241. Youth Sun Deng was the eldest son of Sun Quan, the founding emperor of Wu. He was born to a low-status mother and raised from childhood by Lady Xu, the second wife of Sun Quan. When Cao Pi, emperor of the state of Cao Wei, appointed Sun Quan the King of Wu in 221, he enfeoffed Sun Deng as the Marquis of Wanhu (). However, Sun Quan refused the title for his son as he was only 12 years old. One year later Sun Quan designated Sun Deng as the Crown Prince. When Cao Pi demanded that Sun Quan send Sun Deng to the Wei capital Luoyang as a hostage, to guarantee his loyalty, Sun Quan refused and declared independence. Life and death It is recorded that Sun Deng was both wise and virtuous, having all the makings of a great man. Sun Quan ordered Zhuge ke (), Gu Tan (), Zhang Xiu (), Chen Biao () and others to serve as the Crown Prince's attendants and personal staff. Sun Deng treated his staff kindly. For instance he allowed others to ride with him and sleep close to him. The Crown Prince's palace was considered to have the largest number of outstanding people in China. Sun Deng showed his filial piety to both his father and adoptive mother, even through Lady Xu was divorced from Sun Quan in 212. Aged 20 Sun Deng studied the Book of Han under his father's order. When Sun Quan declared himself emperor in 229 and later moved his capital from Wuchang (; in present-day Ezhou, Hubei) to Jianye, Sun Deng and his younger brothers were left in Wuchang. Sun Deng was in charge of the western parts of Eastern Wu with the help of Lu Xun and Shi Yi until his brother Sun L√º died in 232. He then travelled to Jianye to accompany his father and lived there since then. In 234, Sun Quan personally led a major attack against Wei's border city Hefei. He let Sun Deng to stay in rear area. At that time Sun Deng made some laws to prevent crimeÔºåwhich achieved result successfully. However, Sun Deng was destined never to succeed his father, dying from illness aged 32. Before he died he wrote a letter to inspire his father and recommend talented individuals. Sun Deng was buried in Jurong, Jiangsu initially, then moved to the Jiang Mausoleum () at the Purple Mountain in Jiangsu. He was posthumously honoured as \\"Crown Prince Xuan\\". Personal life In 225, on the arrangement of Sun Quan, Sun Deng married Zhou Yu's daughter. She thus carried the title of Crown Princess. Sun Deng also had another wife, Bing Xuan's (ÈÇ¥ÁéÑ) daughter. Sun Deng had three children: Sun Fan, Sun Ying (Â≠´Ëã±), and Sun Xi. The mother's identity of each is unknown. Both Sun Fan and Sun Xi died at their early age. Thus Sun Ying was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Wu when he grew up. However, Sun Ying was eventually executed because he was accused of attempting to assassinate Sun Jun, the regent who served under the second Wu emperor Sun Liang.

Adler was one of the first theologians to integrate feminist perspectives and concerns into Jewish texts and the renewal of Jewish law and ethics. Her approach to God is Levinasian and her approach to gender is constructivist.Libenson, Dan and Lex Rofeberg, hosts. \\"God and Gender - Rachel Adler.\\" Judaism Unbound, episode 138, 5 Oct. 2018. Life After graduating Northwestern University she married Rabbi Moshe Adler in Chicago in 1965. The couple subsequently divorced. In 1971, while identifying as an Orthodox Jew (though she previously and later identified as Reform Jewish), she published an article entitled \\"The Jew Who Wasn't There: Halacha and the Jewish Woman,\\" in Davka magazine; according to historian Paula Hyman, this article was a trailblazer in analyzing the status of Jewish women using feminism. In 1972, she published an article entitled \\"Tum'ah and Toharah: Ends and Beginnings.\\" In this article she argued that the ritual immersion of a niddah (a menstruating woman) in a mikveh did not \\"oppress or denigrate women.\\" Instead, she argued, such immersion constituted a ritual reenactment of \\"death and resurrection\\" that was actually \\"equally accessible to men and women.\\" However, she eventually renounced this position. In her essay \\"In Your Blood, Live: Re-visions of a Theology of Purity\\", published in Tikkun in 1993, she wrote \\"purity and impurity do not constitute a cycle through which all members of society pass, as I argued in my [1972] essay. Instead, impurity and purity define a class system in which the most impure people are women.\\" In 1983, she published an essay in Moment entitled \\"I've Had Nothing Yet, So I Can't Take More,\\" in which she criticized rabbinic tradition for making women \\"a focus of the sacred rather than active participants in its processes,\\" and declared that being a Jewish woman \\"is very much like being Alice at the Hatter's tea party. We did not participate in making the rules, nor were we there at the beginning of the party.\\" In 1992, she began a women's Talmud class in her home, teaching the text (in its original Hebrew and Aramaic). This created the first rigorous Talmud study opportunity for lay women outside of New York and Israel. Adler received a PhD in Religion from the University of Southern California in 1997; her doctoral dissertation was titled \\"Justice and Peace Have Kissed: A Feminist Theology of Judaism.\\" She is the author of many articles that have appeared in Blackwell's Companion to Feminist Philosophy, Beginning Anew: A Woman's Companion to the High Holy Days, Contemporary Jewish Religious Thought, Lifecycles, The Jewish Condition, and On Being a Jewish Feminist. Originally a Reform Jew, but converting to Orthodox Judaism in her teens, Adler made her final spiritual home in the Reform movement. On May 13, 2012, she was ordained as a rabbi by the Reform seminary Hebrew Union College- Jewish Institute of Religion in Los Angeles. In 2013, Adler became the first person to hold the Rabbi David Ellenson Chair in Jewish Religious Thought at Hebrew Union College.  Awards  She was awarded the 2000 Tuttleman Foundation Book Award of Gratz College and the 1999 National Jewish Book Award for Jewish Thought by the Jewish Book Council for her book Engendering Judaism: An Inclusive Theology and Ethics; this was the first time the National Jewish Book Award for Jewish Thought was ever awarded to a female theologian. Among the book's contributions to Jewish thoughts was the creation of a new ritual, brit ahuvim, to replace the traditional erusin marriage ceremony, which Adler viewed as not according with feminist ideals of equality between the sexes.

C. Robin Hood p 165 (1982) Thames & Hudson. . In his introduction to the ballad, Francis James Child gives its first printing as 1716 in Dryden's Miscellany and remarks on the freedom with which it treats tradition and indeed common sense. A feature of interest is that the author is apparently unaware of the \\"Earl of Huntingdon\\" tradition. Synopsis Robin Hood's father is described as a forester, out-shooting Adam Bell and his companions Clim of the Clough and William a Cloudsley, other famous outlaws of the time. Robin Hood went with his parents to his uncle's Gamwel Hall. Little John amused them there, but Robin Hood is adopted by his uncle the squire. At some later stage (apparently, the continuity isn't clear) Robin Hood set out into Sherwood with Little John. He met Clorinda, the queen of the shepherdess, also out to hunt a deer. She shot one, impressing him, and he invited her to feast with him. After the meal, he asked her to marry him, and she agreed. On the way, eight yeomen tried to steal their deer. After five of them are killed, the rest spared on Little John's intercession. The marriage was celebrated. The overall tone, despite the violent episode, is relaxed and comic.

The x-y plane is shown in blue. A more complicated set (top) and its signed distance function (bottom, in red). In mathematics and its applications, the signed distance function (or oriented distance function) of a set Œ© in a metric space determines the distance of a given point x from the boundary of Œ©, with the sign determined by whether x is in Œ©. The function has positive values at points x inside Œ©, it decreases in value as x approaches the boundary of Œ© where the signed distance function is zero, and it takes negative values outside of Œ©. However, the alternative convention is also sometimes taken instead (i.e., negative inside Œ© and positive outside). Definition If Œ© is a subset of a metric space, X, with metric, d, then the signed distance function, f, is defined by :f(x) = \\\\begin{cases} d(x, \\\\partial \\\\Omega) & \\\\mbox{ if } x\\\\in\\\\Omega \\\\\\\\\\\\ -d(x, \\\\partial \\\\Omega)& \\\\mbox{ if } x\\\\in\\\\Omega^c \\\\end{cases} where \\\\partial \\\\Omega denotes the boundary of \\\\Omega. For any x \\\\in X, : d(x, \\\\partial \\\\Omega) := \\\\inf_{y \\\\in \\\\partial \\\\Omega}d(x, y) where inf denotes the infimum. Properties in Euclidean space If Œ© is a subset of the Euclidean space Rn with piecewise smooth boundary, then the signed distance function is differentiable almost everywhere, and its gradient satisfies the eikonal equation :  abla f=1. If the boundary of Œ© is Ck for k‚â•2 (see differentiability classes) then d is Ck on points sufficiently close to the boundary of Œ©. In particular, on the boundary f satisfies : abla f(x) = N(x), where N is the inward normal vector field. The signed distance function is thus a differentiable extension of the normal vector field. In particular, the Hessian of the signed distance function on the boundary of Œ© gives the Weingarten map. If, further, Œì is a region sufficiently close to the boundary of Œ© that f is twice continuously differentiable on it, then there is an explicit formula involving the Weingarten map Wx for the Jacobian of changing variables in terms of the signed distance function and nearest boundary point. Specifically, if T(‚àÇŒ©,Œº) is the set of points within distance Œº of the boundary of Œ© (i.e. the tubular neighbourhood of radius Œº), and g is an absolutely integrable function on Œì, then :\\\\int_{T(\\\\partial\\\\Omega,\\\\mu)} g(x)\\\\,dx = \\\\int_{\\\\partial\\\\Omega}\\\\int_{-\\\\mu}^\\\\mu g(u+\\\\lambda N(u))\\\\, \\\\det(I-\\\\lambda W_u) \\\\,d\\\\lambda \\\\,dS_u, where det indicates the determinant and dSu indicates that we are taking the surface integral. Algorithms Algorithms for calculating the signed distance function include the efficient fast marching method, fast sweeping methodZhao Hongkai. A fast sweeping method for eikonal equations. Mathematics of Computation, 2005, 74. Jg., Nr. 250, S. 603-627. and the more general level-set method.  Applications  Signed distance fields stored as raster images can be used to represent shapes. Signed distance functions are applied, for example, in real-time rendering and computer vision. They have also been used in a method (advanced by Valve) to render smooth fonts at large sizes (or alternatively at high DPI) using GPU acceleration. Valve's method computed signed distance fields in raster space in order to avoid the computational complexity of solving the problem in the (continuous) vector space. More recently piece-wise approximation solutions have been proposed (which for example approximate a B√©zier with arc splines), but even this way the computation can be too slow for real-time rendering, and it has to be assisted by grid-based discretization techniques to approximate (and cull from the computation) the distance to points that are too far away.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tHv6mcIIeo In 2020 foss game engine Godot 4.0 received SDF based real-time global illumination or SDFGI, that became a compromise between more realistic voxel-based GI and baked GI.

It is long and runs from NY 7 in the city of Troy north to NY 22 in the town of Granville. NY 40 also passes through the villages of Schaghticoke and Argyle and enters the vicinity of the village of Greenwich. It intersects three east‚Äìwest highways of note: NY 67 just outside Schaghticoke, NY 29 west of Greenwich, and NY 149 in the hamlet of Hartford. Incidentally, NY 40 has overlaps with all three routes. NY 40 originally extended south to East Greenbush and north to Comstock when it was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. The route was truncated south to NY 149 in Hartford in the early 1940s and north to U.S. Route 4 in North Greenbush in the late 1950s. It was re-extended northward to its current northern terminus in the 1960s, but also truncated northward to its current southern terminus in the early 1970s. In 1980, ownership and maintenance of the portion of NY 40 south of NY 142 and outside of Troy was transferred from the state of New York to Rensselaer County as part of a highway maintenance swap. This section of the route is co-designated and co- signed as County Route 145 (CR 145) and has no reference markers. Route description = Troy to Easton = NY 40 begins at an intersection with NY 7 (Hoosick Street) just east of the Collar City Bridge in the city of Troy. NY 40 proceeds north along 10th Street for less than a block, turning northeast along Oakwood Avenue, a two-lane mixed commercial and residential street through the Frear Park section of Troy. Passing the campus of St. Mary's Hospital, the route begins to run along the western edges of the namesake park, reaching an entrance at a junction with Frear Park Road. Running along the western edge of Wright Lake, the route turns northward and soon leaves the western extremities of the park. Now back in the North Central section of Troy, NY 40 runs north through Oakwood Cemetery. Signage along NY 40 through Brunswick denoting CR 145 Soon crossing into Lansingburgh, NY 40 runs northeast through the eastern end of the cemetery, passing the nearby St. Peter's Cemetery as well. Just after crossing the northern limits of Oakwood Cemetery, the route crosses into the town of Brunswick, where it becomes maintained by Rensselaer County and gains the County Route 145 (CR 145) designation. Continuing north through Brunswick, NY 40 continues through Lansingburgh, which is where the route meets a junction with NY 142\\\\. NY 40 and NY 142 become concurrent for one block in front of the Lansingburgh Reservoir, before NY 40 turns northward once again. Now on Leversee Road, the route remains a two-lane residential street, reaching a junction with the terminus of CR 116 (Brickyard Road). NY 40 crosses into the town of Schaghticoke, where it gains the Speigletown Road moniker. Through the town of Schaghitcoke, the route remains the two-lane residential road it was through Lansingburgh, reaching a junction with CR 126 (Fogarty Road). At the junction with CR 126, NY 40 turns northward, drops the moniker of Speigletown Road and changes into a much more rural roadway. Passing some residences as it winds northward, the route meets the junction with CR 122 as it enters the populated hamlet of Grant Hollow. Bypassing the center of Grant Hollow, NY 40 soon reaches the hamlet of Melrose, where it meets with the junction with CR 117 (Melrose-Valley Falls Road). Continuing north through the town of Schaghticoke, NY 40 returns to its rural settings north of Melrose, turning northeast at the junction with Northline Drive. Along this northeastern stretch, the route passes through the rural hamlet of Schaghticoke Hill and soon crosses the Tomhonnock Creek into the village of Schaghticoke. At the southern end of the village, NY 40 reaches a junction with NY 67 (Old Schaghticoke Road). NY 40 and NY 67 become concurrent and run along the Hoosic River into the village. Known as Main Street through the village, NY 40 and NY 67 become a two-lane commercial street through the village. Just north of downtown, the routes reach a junction with CR 125, where NY 67 turns eastward while NY 40 proceeds north. NY 40 southbound at the junction with CR 54 in Crandall Corners NY 40 continues north through the town of Schaghticoke, returning the rural settings through the town. After the junction with Casey Road, the route makes a northerly dash to the county line, where it crosses just north of Molesky Lane. Now in Washington County, NY 40 continues north through the town of Easton. Just after the line, the route enters the hamlet of Crandall Corners, where it junctions with the eastern terminus of CR 54\\\\. Turning northeast, the route enters the hamlet of South Easton and soon after, Barkers Grove. Through Barkers Grove, the route passes several local residences and winds north into the hamlet of Easton. NY 40 through Easton is the main thoroughfare, passing multiple residences and a junction with Wells Road and Vly Summit Road. = Easton to Granville = North of the namesake hamlet, NY 40 continues northeast through the town of Easton, soon turning north through rural sections of Washington County. At the junction with Hegeman Bridge Road, the route turns northwest and reaches a junction with NY 29\\\\. NY 29 and NY 40 become concurrent, turning north past the Battenkill Country Club and soon over the Batten Kill. Now in the town of Greenwich and the hamlet of Middle Falls, NY 40 turns northeast and reaches a roundabout, where NY 29 continues east and NY 40 turns north through Greenwich. Continuing north through Greenwich, NY 40 turns northeast at a junction with CR 77 (Bald Mountain Road). NY 40 northbound at NY 197 in the village of Argyle Passing west of the village of Spraguetown, NY 40 winds north through the town of Greenwich for several miles, reaching the hamlet of Lick Springs, a small rural community several miles north of Middle Falls. Here, the route crosses into the town of Argyle, the route proceeds northeast through the town, reaching the junction with the northern terminus of CR 49 (Old State 338). Just north of this junction, the route crosses through the hamlet of South Argyle, a rural community. North of South Argyle, NY 40 continues through the farmlands, soon reaching the namesake village. Now boasting the name of Main Street, NY 40 crosses north through downtown Argyle, reaching a junction at the northern end of the hamlet with the eastern terminus of NY 197. At this intersection, Main Street continues north onto NY 197 while NY 40 turns eastward and soon out of the village. Bending northeast, NY 40 continues through the town of Argyle, passing the Argyle Airport on the northbound side. Crossing into the hamlet of North Argyle, the route reaches the eastern end of CR 44\\\\. North Argyle represents several residences along both sides of the highway, ending at a junction with CR 45\\\\. NY 40 continues north through the town of Argyle, remaining the two-lane rural roadway it has been through most of the municipality. The route soon crosses into the town of Hartford and becomes a mix of rural and residential roadway, reaching the hamlet of East Hartford. NY 40 at the junction with NY 149 in the town of Hartford In East Hartford, NY 40 enters a junction with the eastern terminus of NY 196\\\\. NY 40 through the hamlet is a two-lane residential street, soon reaching a junction with CR 30\\\\. Just to the north, NY 40 runs northeast and enters a junction with NY 149\\\\. NY 40 and NY 149 become concurrent through the town of Hartford, passing east of the namesake hamlet. Just a short distance after, NY 149 turns east and NY 40 continues northeast past Morningside Cemetery. At the north end of the hamlet of Hatford, NY 40 reaches a junction with CR 23\\\\. North of the hamlet, the route returns to its rural surroundings, reaching a junction with another piece of CR 23. For a short distance north of CR 23, NY 40 crosses through the town of Fort Ann, based near a junction with Whitney Road. The route then crosses into the town of Granville, where it enters the rural hamlet of West Granville, and a junction with CR 17 at the center. A block north of CR 17, NY 40 reaches a junction with NY 22\\\\. This junction marks the northern terminus of NY 40, whose right-of-way continues north as Sheehan Road Extension. History =Establishment and realignments= NY 40 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to an alignment extending from East Greenbush in the south to Comstock in the north via the city of Troy and the hamlet of Middle Granville. It began at U.S. Route 9 and U.S. Route 20 and ran concurrent with U.S. Route 4 to Troy, where it split from US 4 at 125th Street. From there, it followed 125th Street, Northern Drive, and Brickyard Road out of the city. NY 40 joined its modern alignment shortly afterward at Leversee Road. The current and original routings of NY 40 remained identical until the town of Hartford. The route left its current alignment north of the hamlet of Hartford and headed northeast to Middle Granville, where it met NY 22\\\\. NY 40 and NY 22 came together, forming an overlap westward to Truthville. NY 22 split from NY 40 here, veering off to the northwest, while NY 40 continued west to US 4 in Comstock, where it ended. The Middle Granville‚ÄìComstock segment of NY 40 was part of NY 24 prior to the renumbering; in fact, it was the only part of NY 40 that was part of a route prior to 1930. NY 40 was realigned slightly by the following year to bypass Middle Granville entirely. Instead of heading northeast from Hartford, NY 40 went northward to West Granville, where it rejoined its previous alignment. By 1932, NY 40 was rerouted in the vicinity of Troy. It now left US 4 in the town of North Greenbush (south of Troy) and followed Winter Street northeastward into the city. Within Troy, NY 40 overlapped NY 66 to its end at Congress Avenue (then-NY 96 and now NY 2) and briefly joined NY 96 westward to 15th Street. NY 40 turned north here, following 15th Street to Oakwood Avenue, where the route joined its modern routing. =Truncations and other developments= Following the 1930s, NY 40 began to be reduced in size. In the early 1940s, NY 22 was realigned between Truthville and Whitehall to serve Comstock by way of NY 40 and US 4\\\\. As a result, NY 40 was truncated south to its junction with NY 149 in Hartford. The portion of NY 40's routing between Hartford and West Granville was a sub-par road at the time (deemed as a second and third-class highway by map cartographer General Drafting), which led the state to place the end of the route in Hartford instead. In the late 1950s, NY 40 was cut back on its southern end to begin at what had been the northern terminus of its overlap with US 4 in North Greenbush. NY 40 was re-extended on its northern end to follow its former routing northeastward to Middle Granville, where it ended at NY 22. The alignment proved to be temporary as the Hartford‚ÄìWest Granville highway was improved during the mid-1960s and became part of a realigned NY 40 by 1968. The last change to NY 40's routing came in 1973 when it was truncated on its southern end to the junction of Hoosick Street (NY 7) and 10th Street in Troy. As a result, NY 40 was also realigned slightly to use 10th Street and Oakwood Avenue between Hoosick and 15th Streets. NY 40's former routing on Winter Street was redesignated as NY 405. On April 1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of the portion of NY 40 that lies south of NY 142 and outside of the Troy city limits was transferred from the state of New York to Rensselaer County as part of a large highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. The routing of NY 40 was not altered; however, the part of the route given to the county is now co- designated as CR 145 and is also co-signed as such. NY 40A NY 40A was an alternate route of NY 40 in the town of Schaghticoke. It connected NY 40 to the Tomhannock Reservoir and the village of Valley Falls and had an overlap with NY 67 between Valley Falls and the village of Schaghticoke. The southern terminus of the route was at an intersection with NY 40 in the hamlet of Melrose. NY 40A's northern terminus was at the junction of NY 40 and NY 67 just north of the Schaghticoke village limits. The route was assigned and removed in the late 1940s. However, the portion of NY 40A's old alignment between the southern Valley Falls village line and NY 67 remained state- maintained until April 1, 1980, when ownership and maintenance of it was transferred to Rensselaer County as part of a large highway maintenance swap between the state and the county. The entirety of NY 40A's former routing south of NY 67 is now CR 117.

He was the eldest son of Xue Zong, a notable official and scholar of the Eastern Wu state. During the reign of the third Wu emperor Sun Xiu ( 258‚Äì264), Xue Xu held the position of General of the Household for All Purposes (‰∫îÂÆò‰∏≠ÈÉéÂ∞á) in the Wu government. Sun Xiu once sent him as an ambassador to Wu's ally state, Shu Han. After observing the conditions in Shu, he predicted that Shu would fall soon. His prediction came true in 263 when Shu was conquered by Wei, the rival state of both Wu and Shu. In 267, during the reign of the fourth and last Wu emperor Sun Hao, Xue Xu was appointed as Court Architect (Â∞á‰ΩúÂ§ßÂå†) and tasked with overseeing the construction of the mausoleum and memorial temple of Sun He, the emperor's father. In 269, when a rebellion broke out in Jiao Province, Sun Hao ordered Xue Xu, who then held the appointment of General Who Awes the South (Â®ÅÂçóÂ∞áËªç), to lead troops from Jing Province to meet up with another army led by Li Xu (ÊùéÂãñ) and Xu Cun (ÂæêÂ≠ò) at Hepu Commandery (ÂêàÊµ¶ÈÉ°; northeast of present-day Hepu County, Guangxi) and attack the rebels together. Yu Si, an army supervisor, and Tao Huang, the Administrator of Cangwu Commandery (ËíºÊ¢ßÈÉ°), served as Xue Xu's subordinates. However, the army led by Li Xu and Xu Cun never reached their destination because their path was obstructed, so only the army led by Xue Xu was available to fight the rebels. Wu Yan, then a low-ranking official, was taken aback by the sight of Xue Xu's army marching towards Jiaozhi Commandery. Xue Xu heeded a suggestion from Tao Huang to send troops to attack Jiaozhi Commandery via a water route, and bribe Liang Qi (Ê¢ÅÂ•á) and other local elites in Jiaozhi to win them over. In 271, Xue Xu's army conquered Jiaozhi Commandery and retook Jiuzhen (‰πùÁúü) and Rinan (Êó•Âçó) commanderies as well. After the campaign in Jiao Province, Sun Hao appointed Yu Si as the Inspector (Âà∫Âè≤) of Jiao Province, but Yu Si died of illness not long later, so Tao Huang succeeded him.

A re-release as a 10\\" red vinyl single was issued in April 2013 to celebrate Record Store Day. Background Holy Roller Novocaine was released a few months before Kings of Leon's debut Youth & Young Manhood hit the shelves, and it garnered significant attention from music critics. The song \\"Molly's Chambers\\" appeared in a Volkswagen Jetta commercial, and the song \\"Holy Roller Novocaine\\" is used at the end of the episode \\"Playing Tight\\" of the third season of The Shield. The songs range from bluesy sounds to organ-infused ballads. This way of playing would be further explored with their five later albums. Holy Roller Novocaine contains alternate takes of songs found on the follow-up Youth & Young Manhood. The version of \\"Wasted Time\\" is different from the same track off Youth & Young Manhood, with the EP version having a more tense riff and different vocal stylings. \\"California Waiting\\" is also different. The version of \\"California Waiting\\" found on the Holy Roller Novocaine EP was recorded in a rush to finish the record. The band initially didn't like the outcome, so they wrote a new version, which is found on Youth and Young Manhood.

One dam was a partially breached low head dam similar to the dam that was removed downriver in Warren in 2009. Because it was located in close proximity to the Warren State Hospital and used to provide a water supply to that facility in years past, this dam was known as the Hospital Dam. The second dam was a remnant rock and crib dam located immediately upriver of the first.

The area was the site of Freedman's Town, composed of recently freed slaves. The first freed slaves departed the Brazos River cotton plantations in 1866 and entered Houston via San Felipe Road (now named West Dallas in the portion from Downtown Houston to Shepherd Drive). The slaves settled on the Buffalo Bayou's southern edge, constructing small shanties as houses. Brush arbors along the bayou and borrowed churches were used as houses of worship. Several more ex-slaves leaving plantations arrived in Freedmen's Town. One brush arbor ultimately became the Antioch Missionary Baptist Church, the church where Jack Yates served as pastor. Yates and his son, Rutherford Yates, became major community leaders in the early days of the Fourth Ward.Snyder, Mike. \\"With its rich history, Fourth Ward is strong in symbolism.\\" Houston Chronicle.

The settlers of Freedmen's Town paved the streets with bricks that they hand-made themselves.\\"History of the Gregory School and Freedmen's Town.\\" African American Library at the Gregory School. Retrieved on December 11, 2009. An oral tradition said that in the early 20th century, members of the congregation of the Reverend Jeremiah Smith paved Andrew Street with the first bricks after the City of Houston refused to pave it. Yates, Smith, and Ned P. Pullum were three of the major Fourth Ward area ministers. The residents provided their own services and utilities. Residents included blacksmiths, brickmakers, doctors, haberdashers, lawyers, and teachers. From 1905 through the 1940s, the Freedman's Town area included what was Houston's largest baseball venue through 1927, West End Park. It was home to the city's Minor League baseball team, the Houston Buffaloes, and it was the city's first venue for Negro Major League games. Antioch Missionary Baptist Church, now in Downtown Houston At the turn of the century, black ministers established businesses and churches and remained as community leaders. During the same period, Italian Americans moved into the Fourth Ward, including Freedmen's Town. The Italian Americans opened small businesses and, over a period of time, acquired more and more Fourth Ward property. Many had extended mercantile credit to customers, and seized property from the customers after they failed to pay off their debts. Their descendants, as of the year 2000, continued to be the owners of many residences in the Fourth Ward. In 1909, African Americans organized a library at Booker T. Washington High School. They were prohibited from accessing Houston's Lyceum and public library. In 1912 the Carnegie Colored Library of Houston was dedicated. It was demolished in 1962 when Interstate 45 was constructed through the Fourth Ward. As more and more families moved in, the neighborhood increasingly became crowded. A narrative that accompanied the 1984 application of the Fourth Ward to become listed in the National Register of Historic Places, based on various historical documents and deed records, said that the crowded conditions and high rent prices may have led to a riot in 1917 when African-American soldiers stationed in the area attacked White people. By the 1920s and 1930s the population density of Freedmen's Town was almost six times that of the average of the entire City of Houston. In the 1920s the Third Ward surpassed the Fourth Ward as the center of Houston's African-American community. =Decline= The Fourth Ward lost prominence due to its inability to expand geographically, as other developments hemmed in the area. Mike Snyder of the Houston Chronicle said that local historians traced the earliest signs of decline to 1940, and that it was influenced by many factors, including the opening of Interstate 45 and the construction of Allen Parkway Village, a public housing complex of the Housing Authority of the City of Houston or HACH (now Houston Housing Authority) that opened in the 1940s.\\"Study Area 11 .\\" City of Houston.

In the northern hemisphere summer of 1991, beginning in May several fires occurred in the Fourth Ward, with three buildings affected in each 30-day interval. By August 1991 nine houses, all previously run-down, had been affected by the fires. Gladys House, former head of the Fourth Ward Freedmen's Town Association, and other area activists expressed a belief that the fires were arson intended to allow the owners of the houses to collect insurance money and facilitate redevelopment of the Fourth Ward. Similar fires that occurred during the previous winter were originally believed to have been started by vagrants trying to stay warm, but House said that suspicion increased when fires began occurring in the spring and summer. H.G. Torres, the assistant chief of the arson bureau of the Houston Fire Department, said that the timings of the fires made the bureau suspect arson. The association offered a $1,000 reward for information that resulted in the arrest of any suspect. In the 1990s a former city planning commission member founded Houston Renaissance, a nonprofit private charity sustained by federal and municipal funds. The charity bought large portions of the community and announced plans to redevelop the parcels into affordable housing. Instead the charity defaulted and the Houston Housing Finance Corp. took control of the lands. The city divided the parcels to the east and the west. The city sold the parcels closest to Downtown Houston to private developers. The city used the acquired funds to develop the remaining parcels into subsidized houses, with each priced around $110,000. Historic Oaks of Allen Parkway Village The Houston Housing Authority (HHA), then known as Housing Authority of the City of Houston (HACH), made a unanimous vote to demolish Allen Parkway Village. This caused residents to begin a campaign to rescue the complex, including activist Lenwood Johnson. The legal campaign reached the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In 1996 Henry Cisneros, the head of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, signed an agreement to allow the City of Houston to demolish 677 of the community's 963 units as long as the site was still used for low income housing.

The community had 530 historic buildings on of land when it was designated a site of the National Register of Historic Places on January 17, 1985. In 2007, David Ellison of the Houston Chronicle said that, according to Fourth Ward community leaders, 40 historic buildings remained, and that they were located in an area roughly bounded by Arthur, Gennessee, West Dallas, and West Gray. Since 1984 over 500 of the surveyed historic buildings were demolished. These buildings included businesses, churches, and houses. By 2012, 30 of the surveyed historic structures remained. Of the 13 surveyed churches, six still existed in 2012.Rhor, Monica. \\"HCC students uncovering Houston's history.\\" Houston Chronicle. Friday June 29, 2012. Retrieved on July 28, 2012.

Shotgun shacks in the Fourth Ward Originally most of the housing consisted of shotgun houses. The one-story houses were long and skinny, and used breezes to cool the interiors. Almost all of the shotgun houses had large front porches; the narrative accompanying the 1984 National Register of Historic Places application said that the porches allowed the houses to cool down, and also allowed residents to talk to neighbors and watch children, who only had the streets as a viable place to play. The narrative said \\"Significantly, the porch is usually the only element of the houses that exhibits any architectural pretension.\\" Due to redevelopment, the eastern portion of the Fourth Ward consists of postmodern townhouses built by developers. Many of the townhouses have corrugated metal, and Downtown Houston is visible from the properties. Many young urban professionals and empty nesters live in the townhouses. The area west of Buckner street has many two story suburban style houses on small lots, intended for lower income individuals. As of 2006 few shotgun houses remain in the Fourth Ward. As of 2007 the newer, subsidized market value houses each had a cost of $92,000; most of the shotgun houses were replaced by the market value houses. The townhouses each have a cost twice that of the subsidized houses. Many longtime African-American residents who had lived in the neighborhood for long periods of time were unable to afford to qualify to pay for loans to buy the newer subsidized houses or the townhouses. 1500 block of Victor Street As of 2007 the largest concentration of remaining older homes is on Victor Street, on the south side; the north side of Victor Street has an apartment complex owned by the Houston Housing Authority. Victor Street has the only all-older house cluster remaining in the Fourth Ward, with other clusters being mixes of older and newer homes and multifamily complexes. Lisa Gray of the Houston Chronicle said that the ten shotgun houses on 1501 to 1519 Victor Street, in one row, \\"were apparently built in two phases.\\" Some were built in 1914, and others were built in a period from 1920 to 1922. She said that they had an identical appearance and were \\"a typical row of row houses, nothing fancy, nothing special\\" but \\"just by surviving, they became special.\\" The houses were listed under the National Historic Register of Historic Places and the Houston Architectural Guide, but the City of Houston law did not protect the buildings from demolition under historic ordinances. In April 2007 the owners of the houses asked the final residents to move out because the municipal government had cited some of the houses for violations of municipal code. The violations included a failure to maintain clean conditions and problems with the electrical systems. The final resident was scheduled to move out in June of that year. Jill Jewett, the assistant for cultural affairs of Mayor of Houston Bill White, said that the city government wants the community to preserve the 1500 block of Victor houses. Thuong Tran, a member of the family who owned the houses, said that she hoped to lease the property and the houses to a nonprofit that would repair the houses. She said that the family planned to restore the houses, but they were not sure if they would remain at that location, or if the family will send the land and move the houses themselves to an area outside of the 610 Loop.Ellison, David. \\"Historic Fourth Ward residents try to hold on.\\" Houston Chronicle.

In 2011 the Harris County Appraisal District stated that the houses were together worth fewer than $750 while the land they stood on was worth over $500,000 more than the house value. The district referred to the houses as an \\"economic misimprovement.\\" That year, the owners of the ten houses, Kimsu and Kimberly Hoang, filed a demolition permit with the City of Houston. Culture Mike Snyder of the Houston Chronicle said that \\"the politics of race have been a potent force in the Fourth Ward.\\" In the 1920s African-American tenants said that they were paying very high tenants to rent from poorly maintained buildings owned by white landlords. After flooding occurred in the neighborhood in one period, an African-American newspaper said that neglect from the city government was responsible. Jesse Jackson toured the Fourth Ward during his 1988 presidential campaign; Jackson accused the city of neglecting the community. In 2007 David Ellison of the Houston Chronicle said that \\"[t]here is some friction between new and longtime residents, some of whom complain that the redevelopment benefits the newcomers, not them\\" and that \\"[t]he two groups seem to lead separate lives, with many newer residents sticking to themselves and longtime people, such as those on Victor Street, trying to continue life as it was. \\" The New Fourth Ward Homeowners Association represents the owners of the newer subsidized houses. In 2007 Mayor of Houston Bill White said that he is trying to make improvements to the Fourth Ward that most of its residents desire in order to bring together the two groups of Fourth Ward residents. During the same year, Christine Diaz, the president of the new residents organization, said that the group is trying to bring together the two groups of residents.

Stirling estimated the Binjareb present numbered \\"about 60 or 70\\" and John Roe, who also participated, at about 70‚Äì80, which roughly agree with an estimate of 70 by an unidentified eyewitness. On the attacking side, Captain Theophilus Tighe Ellis was killed and Corporal Patrick Heffron was injured. On the defending side an uncertain number of Binjareb men, women and children were killed. While Stirling quantified the number of Binjareb killed as probably 15 males, Roe estimated the number killed as 15‚Äì20, and an unidentified eyewitness as 25‚Äì30 including 1 woman and several children in addition to it being \\"very probable that more men were killed in the river and floated down with the stream\\". The number of Binjareb injured is unknown, as is the number of deaths resulting from injuries sustained during the attack. The Pinjarra Massacre was the culmination of increasing tension and violence between European settlers and Noongar peoples. Despite Stirling after the attack \\"effectively threatening to kill 80% of the Noongar population of the South West\\" (which would equate to genocide) should the Binjareb continue to resist, some did continue while others sought peace. Although the effects of the attack's outcome were devastating for the Binjareb, allowing \\"surrounding groups to exploit the weakness of the once powerful Binjareb\\", the Bindjareb today are strong custodians and representatives of their culture and of greater Australia. Background Robert Menli Lyon had commented on the fact that some of the soldiers from Van Diemen's Land would as soon shoot an Aboriginal as shoot a kangaroo. There had been Aboriginal payback attacks on settlers, including the murder of Hugh Nesbitt, a servant of Thomas Peel and the wounding of Edward Barron. Captain Frederick Irwin, the lieutenant governor in Stirling's absence, had inflamed the situation, adopting a soldier's attitude to crush a warlike group of Aboriginals and reduce them to a state of subjection. > It was this unyielding, overbearing attitude that had alienated [Irwin] from > the body of Swan River settlers and caused them to burn him in effigy on the > eve of his departure. It was a narrow, regimented view of frontier problems > and, perhaps, part of the blame for the Pinjarra massacre can be attributed > to Irwin and his unsympathetic administration of Aboriginal affairs during > James Stirling's absence. Stirling had been visiting the seaport of Albany and bad weather caused his return to be delayed until September. In response to calls from Pinjarra settlers for protection against the increased hostility of local Binjareb Noongars led by Calyute, Stirling organised a mounted force of police, bushmen and ex-soldiers. Their brief was to protect settlers, safeguard Aboriginal mail-carriers and confront the Binjareb on the Murray River. A small garrison at Dandalup had been withdrawn from fear of Aboriginal reprisals after they had shot some Aboriginal people. The Binjareb tribe had a reputation with other local Aboriginal tribes for their aggression and attacks on other Aborigines and settlers. It is possible that their motives for attacking the local settlers were part of an attempt to assert their power amongst other local tribes and to take advantage of the political upheaval caused by the arrival of the British settlers, and the death of many Perth Wadjuk people. Stirling and others, drawing on the experience of Scottish clans and native American Indians of North America, were afraid of a possible alliance between the Binjareb and Weeip's Wadjuk people in the Upper Swan, and sought to prevent such an alliance by an attack on the Aboriginal people to the south. Stirling's attack at Pinjarra was specifically to collectively punish the Binjareb for their earlier individual attacks, to re-establish a barracks on the road to the south, to and enable Peel to attract settlers into his lands at Mandurah. This followed an earlier failure by Surveyor General Septimus Roe and pastoralist Thomas Peel, who had led an expedition to the area with the goal of improving security and negotiating peaceful co-existence. Stirling wanted a \\"decisive action\\" that would end the attacks \\"once and for all\\". Preparations Stirling had wanted to begin on 17 October, but a Murray man seen in Perth was suspected of being a spy for Calyute and so the expedition was delayed one week. On the morning of Saturday 25 October, Stirling and Roe left Perth and travelled southwards to the Preston Ferry, there waiting for surveyor George Smyth and Corporal Julius Delmidge, who had brought supplies south by boat from Perth. Spare horses from the ferry were loaded with supplies as the party set off to Hamilton Hill, skirting Fremantle to the east. There they were joined by Ellis and the five mounted police, superintendent Richard Meares and his son, Seymour. They then rode south to Peel's homestead where they were joined by Peel and two others. On the morning of 27 October, ten soldiers of the 21st Regiment, two corporals and eight privates, arrived to join the party. Ammunition was issued to a party on 27 October 1834, and they were issued with several weeks' supplies, as the soldiers were to remain at Pinjarra and establish the planned garrison there. Leaving Peel's farm they crossed the Serpentine River and went forward to the Murray delta where tracks of a sizeable group of Aboriginal men women and children were discovered heading towards Pinjarra. In the late afternoon, they camped at Jinjanuk, from the mouth of the Murray River, so that they could begin the attack early next morning when they judged the Aboriginal group would be least prepared. Massacre The group woke two hours before dawn on 28 October, and ate breakfast in the dark. By 8:00 am, the party had rejoined the Murray where the river was wide, between steep red loam banks, continuing northwards to cross the Oakley brook at about 8:35 am. Peel approached along the western bank of the river and returned to tell of a settlement of about 20 bark beehive shaped mia-mias in the bend of the river. The weather broke and it started to rain heavily as Ellis, Charles Norcott and three of the police attacked from the south. The Aboriginal men gathered up their spears and woomeras, as the women and children fled towards the river, where Stirling, Meares, Peel and 12 others were waiting in hiding. Ellis was soon in a melee with the Noongars, and Norcott, recognising a troublemaker called Noonaar, shot him with his double-barrelled shotgun, causing the first casualty. Five or more Aboriginal people were killed in the first charge, and the remainder then turned and ran towards the river, intending to cross and scatter into the hills. Daisy M. Bates, writing for local newspaper The Western Mail, 5 August 1926, said Noonaar had been in the act of throwing a spear at Norcott when he was shot dead. She also wrote that eight women and some children were spared and assured of their personal safety, held during the fighting, then released afterward, on realising this some men \\"cried out that they were of the other sex\\". There are conflicting reports in regards to whether or not women and children were also shot and killed, with both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people claiming that this did happen. Stirling, hearing the shots, reacted quickly. Roe was sent with four others to prevent the group escaping south and guard the pack horses at the ford. The governor and 14 others in a line abreast then ambushed the Noongar people who had crossed the river. Ellis had been dislodged from his horse but Norcott continued pushing the group into the river where they were caught in a withering crossfire. The flood-scoured slopes gave the men, women and children little cover as they tried to hide behind what logs or bushes there were. Many ducked into the water, holding their breath as long as they could. Some tried to float downstream out of range, but the water was too shallow to permit their escape. They, too, were shot. Roe's journal records \\"Very few wounded were suffered to escape\\". Soldiers fired indiscriminately at those caught in the ambush and, when all had been slain, the posse remounted to chase the others who had fled north into the bush. By 10:05 am it was all over and, because of the serious condition of two of the British wounded, Stirling returned immediately to Mandurah. Casualties On the settlers' side, Heffron was wounded in the arm, but recovered. Ellis was suffering concussion, either from a glancing blow from a spear or from the fall off his horse, and died on 11 November, having been in a coma for two weeks. Later that week The Jackets of Green, a folk ballad honouring Ellis, was published and sheet music sold at hotels in Guildford and Perth. On the Aboriginal side there are conflicting reports. 60-70 Aboriginal men, women and children in the camp had been subjected to intensive fire of 24 guns for an hour, and for another half-hour the survivors were hunted through the bush. No male prisoners were taken alive and all wounded were immediately shot. At the end of hostilities, eight women and a few children were taken as captives. In his report, Stirling claimed 15 Aboriginal men had been killed. Roe estimated the dead at 15‚Äì20. But these numbers don't seem to have included women and children. Captain Daniel, whom Stirling later sent to survey the site of the incident, implied that many more were killed than officially acknowledged, as he found several mass graves, but the rain and his fear of an attack made exhuming the bodies for an official count impossible. Advocate-General George Fletcher Moore estimated from his own investigations (he was not present) that between 25 and 30 were left dead on the field and in the river. The colony's native interpreter, Francis Armstrong, was given a woomera by a survivor shortly after the ambush, a description of which was printed in the Perth Gazette; an image drawn on the object depicted a river, horses, humans and the graves of the slain. Armstrong and Peel later attempted an official count by interviewing the Aborigines Ninda and Colling, who had been present. Some 11 names were given but, in view of the prohibition in Noongar culture against speaking of the dead, their task was almost impossible. Amongst the dead were Unia, Calyute's youngest son, and Gummol who had been flogged for his part in the earlier attack on Shenton's Mill. Two of Calyute's wives were amongst the wounded; Yornup's lower leg had been shot away, and Mindip had been shot in the left arm and right thigh. At the end of the hostilities, Stirling gave the Noongar people a terrifying threat. If there were any retaliatory payback killings from the Binjareb, he declared, \\"no one would be allowed to remain alive on this side of the Mountains\\" (the Darling Scarp). Consequences The massacre seemed to have increased and intensified the settlers' fears rather than allayed them. The belief that Aboriginal people would unite to drive the colonists out persisted into the 1850s when there was another massacre of Aboriginals gathering for a corroboree at Whiteman Park near Guildford. Mounted police continued regular patrols in the area, and the police force at Mandurah continued, though there was no further trouble. Peel continued to call for action to wipe out and exterminate the rest of the Binjareb, whom he called \\"a nest of hornets\\", although there were no further payback reprisals. The killing of so many Binjareb caused a major population imbalance between rival Aboriginal groups, with Swan and Canning Wadjuk and York Balardong attempting to profit from the decimation of the Murray Binjareb. Stirling also personally profited, as he was able to take ownership of Binjareb lands in the Harvey district, untroubled. Five months after the massacre, the Murray group sent a deputation to the governor seeking an end to hostilities and the later killings that had followed. Maigo, of the Wadjuk, went as a messenger, and the Binjareb promised support for actions of the governor. With the Wadjuk camped at the fresh water Doodinup spring at what is now Spring Street, and the Binjareb camped at the Deedyallup water-hole near the present ABC building, a joint corroboree and distribution of 50 loaves of bread sealed the peace. Calyute survived the massacre, but his continued existence annoyed Peel. Calyute equally hated Peel, biting his beard whenever he saw his old enemy. Back to Pinjarra Day Since 1991, the massacre is annually remembered by the Binjareb people on 28 October; the commemoration is named Back to Pinjarra Day. Binjareb Noongar man Theo Kearing and his wife Gloria Kearing were central figures in starting this memorial, after many years of work to have the event recognised as a massacre. It is performed at a memorial site in Pinjarra.

Under some definitions, \\"slow\\" means significantly slower than potential growth as estimated by macroeconomists, even though the growth rate may be nominally higher than in other countries not experiencing economic stagnation. Secular stagnation theory The term \\"secular stagnation\\" was originally coined by Alvin Hansen in 1938 to \\"describe what he feared was the fate of the American economy following the Great Depression of the early 1930s: a check to economic progress as investment opportunities were stunted by the closing of the frontier and the collapse of immigration\\". Warnings similar to secular stagnation theory have been issued after all deep recessions, but they usually turned out to be wrong because they underestimated the potential of existing technologies.Pagano and Sbracia (2014) \\"The secular stagnation hypothesis: a review of the debate and some insights.\\" Bank of Italy Questioni di Economia e Finanza occasional paper series number QEF-231. Secular stagnation refers to \\"a condition of negligible or no economic growth in a market-based economy\\". In this context, the term secular is used in contrast to cyclical or short-term, and suggests a change of fundamental dynamics which would play out only in its own time. Alan Sweezy described the difference: > \\"But, whereas business-cycle theory treats depression as a temporary, though > recurring, phenomenon, the theory of secular stagnation brings out the > possibility that depression may become the normal condition of the economy.\\" According to Alan Sweezy \\"the idea of secular stagnation runs through much of Keynes General Theory\\". Stagnation in the United States =Historical periods of stagnation in the United States= *The years following the Panic of 1873, known as the Long Depression, were followed by periods of stagnation intermixed with surges of growth until steadier growth resumed around 1896. The period was characterized by business bankruptcies, low interest rates and deflation. According to David Ames Wells (1891) the economic problems were the result of rapid changes in technology, such as railroads, steam-powered ocean ships, steel displacing iron and the telegraph system. Because there was so much economic growth overall, how much of this period was stagnation remains controversial.

Post War Economic Problems, Harris (1943) was written with the expectation that the stagnation would continue after the war ended. See: Causes of the Great Depression 19th century The U.S. economy of the early 19th century was primarily agricultural and suffered from labor shortages. Capital was so scarce before the Civil War that private investors supplied only a fraction of the money to build railroads, despite the large economic advantage railroads offered. As new territories were opened and federal land sales conducted, land had to be cleared and new homesteads established. Hundreds of thousands of immigrants came to the United States every year and found jobs digging canals and building railroads. Because there was little mechanization, almost all work was done by hand or with horses, mules and oxen until the last two decades of the 19th century. The decade of the 1880s saw great growth in railroads and the steel and machinery industries. Purchase of structures and equipment increased 500% from the previous decade. Labor productivity rose 26.5% and GDP nearly doubled. The workweek during most of the 19th century was over 60 hours, being higher in the first half of the century, with twelve-hour work days common. There were numerous strikes and other labor movements for a ten- hour day. The tight labor market was a factor in productivity gains allowing workers to maintain or increase their nominal wages during the secular deflation that caused real wages to rise in the late 19th century. Labor did suffer temporary setbacks, such as when railroads cut wages during the Long Depression of the mid-1870s; however, this resulted in strikes throughout the nation. End of stagnation in the U.S. after the Great Depression Construction of structures, residential, commercial and industrial, fell off dramatically during the depression, but housing was well on its way to recovering by the late 1930s. The depression years were the period of the highest total factor productivity growth in the United States, primarily to the building of roads and bridges, abandonment of unneeded railroad track and reduction in railroad employment, expansion of electric utilities and improvements wholesale and retail distribution. This helped the United States, which escaped the devastation of World War II, to quickly convert back to peacetime production. The war created pent up demand for many items as factories that once produced automobiles and other machinery converted to production of tanks, guns, military vehicles and supplies. Tires had been rationed due to shortages of natural rubber; however, the U.S. government built synthetic rubber plants. The U.S. government also built ammonia plants, aluminum smelters, aviation fuel refineries and aircraft engine factories during the war. After the war, commercial aviation, plastics and synthetic rubber would become major industries and synthetic ammonia was used for fertilizer. The end of armaments production freed up hundreds of thousands of machine tools, which were made available for other industries. They were needed in the rapidly growing aircraft manufacturing industry. The memory of war created a need for preparedness in the United States. This resulted in constant spending for defense programs, creating what President Eisenhower called the military-industrial complex. U.S. birth rates began to recover by the time of World War II, and turned into the baby boom of the postwar decades. A building boom commenced in the years following the war. Suburbs began a rapid expansion and automobile ownership increased. High-yielding crops and chemical fertilizers dramatically increased crop yields and greatly lowered the cost of food, giving consumers more discretionary income. Railroad locomotives switched from steam to diesel power, with a large increase in fuel efficiency. Most importantly, cheap food essentially eliminated malnutrition in countries like the United States and much of Europe. Many trends that began before the war continued: *The use of electricity grew steadily as prices continued to fall, although at a slower rate than in the early decades. More people purchased washing machines, dryers, refrigerators and other appliances. Air conditioning became increasingly prevalent in households and businesses. See:Diffusion of innovations#Diffusion data *Infrastructures: The highway system continued to expand. Construction of the interstate highway system started in the late 1950s. The pipeline network continued to expand. Railroad track mileage continued its decline. *Better roads and increased investment in the distribution system of trucks, warehouses and material-handling equipment, such as forklift trucks, continued to reduce the cost of goods. *Mechanization of agriculture increased dramatically, especially the use of combine harvesters. Tractor sales peaked in the mid-1950s. The workweek never returned to the 48 hours or more that was typical before the Great Depression. =Stagflation= The period following the 1973 oil crisis was characterized by stagflation, the combination of low economic and productivity growth and high inflation. The period was also characterized by high interest rates, which is not entirely consistent with secular stagnation. Stronger economic growth resumed and inflation declined during the 1980s. Although productivity never returned to peak levels, it did enjoy a revival with the growth of the computer and communications industries in the 1980s and 1990s. This enabled a recovery in GDP growth rates; however, debt in the period following 1982 grew at a much faster rate than GDP. There are numerous graphs of total debt/GDP available on the Internet. The U.S. economy experienced structural changes following the stagflation. Steel consumption peaked in 1973, both on an absolute and per-capita basis, and never returned to previous levels. In the U. S., steel consumption peaked at just under 700 kg per capita and declined to just over 400 kg by 2000. The energy intensity of the United States and many other developed economies also began to decline after 1973. Health care expenditures rose to over 17% of the economy. =Productivity slowdown= Productivity growth began to slow down sharply in developed countries after 1973, but there was a revival in the 1990s which still left productivity growth below the peak decades earlier in the 20th century. Productivity growth in the U.S. slowed again since the mid-2000s.The Recent Rise and Fall of Rapid Productivity Growth A recent book titled The Great Stagnation: How America Ate All the Low-Hanging Fruit of Modern History, Got Sick and Will (Eventually) Feel better by Tyler Cowen is one of the latest of several stagnation books written in recent decades. Turning Point by Robert Ayres and The Evolution of Progress by C. Owen Paepke were earlier books that predicted the stagnation. =Stagnation and the financial explosion: the 1980s= A prescient analysis of stagnation and what is now called financialization was provided in the 1980s by Harry Magdoff and Paul Sweezy, coeditors of the independent socialist journal Monthly Review. Magdoff was a former economic advisor to Vice President Henry A. Wallace in Roosevelt‚Äôs New Deal administration, while Sweezy was a former Harvard economics professor. In their 1987 book, Stagnation and the Financial Explosion, they argued, based on Keynes, Hansen, Micha≈Ç Kalecki, and Marx, and marshaling extensive empirical data, that, contrary to the usual way of thinking, stagnation or slow growth was the norm for mature, monopolistic (or oligopolistic) economies, while rapid growth was the exception. Private accumulation had a strong tendency to weak growth and high levels of excess capacity and unemployment/underemployment, which could, however, be countered in part by such exogenous factors as state spending (military and civilian), epoch-making technological innovations (for example, the automobile in its expansionary period), and the growth of finance. In the 1980s and 1990s Magdoff and Sweezy argued that a financial explosion of long duration was lifting the economy, but this would eventually compound the contradictions of the system, producing ever bigger speculative bubbles, and leading eventually to a resumption of overt stagnation. =Post-2008 period= This chart compares U.S. potential GDP under two CBO forecasts (one from 2007 and one from 2016) versus the actual real GDP. It is based on a similar diagram from economist Larry Summers from 2014.Larry Summers-U.S. Economic Prospects-Keynote Address at the NABE Conference 2014 Secular stagnation was dusted off by Hans-Werner Sinn in a 2009 article Hans-Werner Sin, Forget Inflation, February 26, 2009 dismissing the threat of inflation, and became popular again when Larry Summers invoked the term and concept during a 2013 speech at the IMF. However, The Economist criticizes secular stagnation as \\"a baggy concept, arguably too capacious for its own good\\". Warnings similar to secular stagnation theory have been issued after all deep recessions, but they all turned out to be wrong because they underestimated the potential of existing technologies. Paul Krugman, writing in 2014, clarified that it refers to \\"the claim that underlying changes in the economy, such as slowing growth in the working-age population, have made episodes like the past five years in Europe and the United States, and the last 20 years in Japan, likely to happen often. That is, we will often find ourselves facing persistent shortfalls of demand, which can‚Äôt be overcome even with near-zero interest rates.\\" At its root is \\"the problem of building consumer demand at a time when people are less motivated to spend\\". One theory is that the boost in growth by the internet and technological advancement in computers of the new economy does not measure up to the boost caused by the great inventions of the past. An example of such a great invention is the assembly line production method of Fordism. The general form of the argument has been the subject of papers by Robert J. Gordon. It has also been written about by Owen. C. Paepke and Tyler Cowen. Secular stagnation has also been linked to the rise of the digital economy. Carl Benedikt Frey, for example, has suggested that digital technologies are much less capital-absorbing, creating only little new investment demand relative to other revolutionary technologies. Another is that the damage done by the Great Recession was so long-lasting and permanent, so many workers will never get jobs again, that we really can't recover. A third is that there is a \\"persistent and disturbing reluctance of businesses to invest and consumers to spend\\", perhaps in part because so much of the recent gains have gone to the people at the top, and they tend to save more of their money than people‚Äîordinary working people who can't afford to do that. And a fourth is that advanced economies are just simply paying the price for years of inadequate investment in infrastructure and education, the basic ingredients of growth. Episodes =Japan: 1991‚Äìpresent= Japan has been suffering economic or secular stagnation for most of the period since the early 1990s.Lessons from Japan's Secular Stagnation The Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry Economists, such as Paul Krugman, attribute the stagnation to a liquidity trap (a situation in which monetary policy is unable to lower nominal interest rates because these are close to zero) exacerbated by demographics factors. =World since 2008= Economists have asked whether the low economic growth rate in the developed world leading up to and following the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 was due to secular stagnation. Paul Krugman wrote in September 2013: \\"[T]here is a case for believing that the problem of maintaining adequate aggregate demand is going to be very persistent ‚Äì that we may face something like the 'secular stagnation' many economists feared after World War II.\\" Krugman wrote that fiscal policy stimulus and higher inflation (to achieve a negative real rate of interest necessary to achieve full employment) may be potential solutions.Paul Krugman-Bubbles, Regulation and Secular Stagnation-September 25, 2013 Larry Summers presented his view during November 2013 that secular (long-term) stagnation may be a reason that U.S. growth is insufficient to reach full employment: \\"Suppose then that the short term real interest rate that was consistent with full employment [i.e., the \\"natural rate\\"] had fallen to negative two or negative three percent. Even with artificial stimulus to demand you wouldn't see any excess demand. Even with a resumption in normal credit conditions you would have a lot of difficulty getting back to full employment.\\"Paul Krugman-Conscience of a Liberal Blog-Secular Stagnation, Coalmines, Bubbles, and Larry Summers-November 16, 2013 Robert J. Gordon wrote in August 2012: \\"Even if innovation were to continue into the future at the rate of the two decades before 2007, the U.S. faces six headwinds that are in the process of dragging long-term growth to half or less of the 1.9 percent annual rate experienced between 1860 and 2007. These include demography, education, inequality, globalization, energy/environment, and the overhang of consumer and government debt. A provocative 'exercise in subtraction' suggests that future growth in consumption per capita for the bottom 99 percent of the income distribution could fall below 0.5 percent per year for an extended period of decades\\".Robert J. Gordon-Is U.S. Economic Growth Over? Faltering Innovation Confronts the Six Headwinds-August 2012 The German Institute for Economic Research sees a connection between secular stagnation and the regime of low interest rates (Zero interest-rate policy, negative interest rates).German Institute for Economic Research, January 30th, 2017: \\"The Natural Rate of Interest and Secular Stagnation\\" See also * Brezhnev stagnation *The End of Work *Business cycle *Degrowth *Recession References Further reading  Bloomberg-Secular Stagnation Category:Unemployment Category:Economic growth Category:Market trends Category:Business cycle ","title":"Economic stagnation"},{"id":"5660965","title":"List of One Life to Live characters"},{"id":"5660976","text":"Eric Friedlander, Moers Festival, 2012 :For the mathematician, see Eric Friedlander. Erik Friedlander is an American cellist and composer based in New York City. A veteran of New York City's experimental downtown scene, Friedlander has worked in many context, but is perhaps best known for his frequent collaborations with saxophonist John Zorn. Friedlander grew up in a home filled with art and music: his father is photographer Lee Friedlander, noted for the cover photographs he took for Atlantic Records. His father's fondness for R&B; and jazz helped shape Friedlander's taste in music. He graduated from Columbia University in 1982. Friedlander started playing guitar at age six and added cello two years later. Apart from his work with Zorn, Friedlander has worked with Laurie Anderson, Courtney Love and Alanis Morissette, and is a member of the jazz/fusion quartet Topaz. He created the original music for the historical documentary Kingdom of David: The Saga of the Israelites.

In this case, an excise tariff was imposed on manufacturers, with an exemption being available for those who paid \\"fair and reasonable\\" wages to their employees. Background The first decade after the Federation of Australia saw a series of minority governments until the 1910 election. The Protectionist Party formed the first government with the support of the Labour Party, on the understanding that the Protectionists would implement a number of social reforms desired by Labor. In 1906 the second Deakin government was in power, with support from Labour. Prime Minister Deakin's 'New Protection' provided tariff protection to employers in exchange for 'fair and reasonable' wages for employees. Isaac Isaacs was the Attorney-General in Deakin's government. The secretary of the Attorney- General's Department, Sir Robert Garran, later recalled that Isaacs \\"had a remarkably keen brain but it was apt to be sometimes too subtle for my liking. When we were drafting a bill whose constitutionality was not beyond doubt, his devices to conceal any possible want of power were sometimes so ingenious as to raise, rather than evade, suspicion\\". H. B. Higgins was a member of the Protectionist Party, but was in broad agreement with the Labour Party social reforms. When the Labour Party sought to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill to cover State railway employees, Higgins was one of the radicals who supported the amendments and helped bring down Deakin's government. When Labour formed a minority government in 1904, Higgins became Attorney-General in the Labour ministry, because Labour had no suitably qualified lawyer in Parliament. Both Isaacs and Higgins had previously been members of the Parliament of Victoria and in 1896 supported the trial introduction of a minimum wage. In October 1906 Isaacs and Higgins were each appointed to the High Court, setting up a clash between the three inaugural 'federalist' judges, Griffith CJ, Barton & O'Connor JJ, and the two 'nationalist' judges, Isaacs & Higgins JJ. All five judges had been leading participants in the Constitutional Conventions and all are properly seen as among the framers of the Constitution. at [48]-[49]. In 1907 O'Connor J resigned as President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration and was replaced by Higgins J. =Customs and Excise payable on Harvesters= The Commonwealth government introduced two bill that would become the Customs Tariff Act 1906,. and the Excise Tariff Act 1906,. Both Isaacs and Higgins spoke in support of the bills that imposed custom and excise duties that were payable on certain agricultural machinery, including stripper harvesters. The Excise Tariff Act 1906 contained a proviso that the excise would not be payable if the manufacturer paid \\"fair and reasonable\\" wages as follows: > Provided that this Act shall not apply to goods manufactured by any person > in any part of the Commonwealth under conditions as to remuneration of > labour which‚Äî > > 1. are declared by resolution of both Houses of Parliament to be fair and > reasonable; or > 2. are in accordance with an industrial award under the Commonwealth > Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904; or > 3. are in accordance with the terms of an industrial agreement filed under > the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904; or > 4. are, on an application made for the purpose to the President of the > Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, declared to be fair and > reasonable by him or by a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State or any > person or persons who compose a State Industrial Authority to whom he may > refer the matter. =The Harvester case= Elmore, Victoria, Australia. Hugh Victor McKay, one of Australia's largest employers, owned the Sunshine Harvester Works where agricultural machinery was built. In 1907 McKay applied to the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration for a declaration that the wages at his factory were \\"fair and reasonable\\". McKay admitted that he was in a position to pay whatever the court found to be fair and reasonable wages. Higgins J heard the application and submissions were made by unions and other large manufacturers. Higgins J determined that the minimum wage for unskilled workers should be 7 shillings per day and published a schedule of fair and reasonable wages called \\"The Excise Tariff Standard for Time-work\\". Higgins J declared that the wages paid by McKay were not fair and reasonable in so far as they fell below that standard.Ex Parte H.V. McKay (Harvester case) (1907) 2 CAR 1 =The prosecutions= Despite the declaration in the Harvester case, McKay did not increase the wages paid to his employees to the minimum that Higgins J had declared to be fair and reasonable, nor did he pay the excise specified in the Excise Act 1906. Both McKay and another manufacturer of agricultural machinery in Melbourne, William Barger, were prosecuted by the Commonwealth for failing to pay the excise. The defences of Barger and McKay included an objection that the Excise Act 1906 was invalid. That objection was referred to the Full Court of the High Court for hearing. The argument for Barger and McKay was that although the Act on its face purports to be an exercise of the taxation power, the real substance and effect of the Act was with respect to the conditions and remuneration of labour. The State of Victoria obtained leave to intervene in both cases and similarly argued the Excise Act 1906 was invalid. The Commonwealth argued that the Act was an exercise of the taxation power and there could be no issue of reserved powers as the excise power was exclusive to the Commonwealth.section 90 Commonwealth of Australia Constitution. The issues before the High Court were whether the Excise Act 1906 : # was in substance an excise tax; # discriminated between States or parts of States; # dealt with a matter other than taxation;section 55 Commonwealth of Australia Constitution. and # interfered with matters reserved exclusively to the States. Decision The Court had to consider whether the Commonwealth had power to indirectly regulate the working conditions of workers under section 51(ii) of the Australian Constitution. The Court was divided 3:2 and the division in the Court can be seen as a continuation of the debate in the constitutional conventions about the nature of the federal system and the legislative powers of the new Commonwealth. While the doctrine of reserved powers permeated the decision of the majority, Grifith CJ, Barton & O'Connor JJ, it is not clear that the decision rested solely on that doctrine. =Was the Act in substance an excise?= Grifith CJ, Barton and O'Connor JJ Their Honours held that the Excise Tariff Act 1906 was invalid because it was not in substance a tax, but rather an impermissible attempt to regulate the conditions of manufacture, and that went beyond extent of the taxation power. Their Honours approached the substance of the Act by considering the position of the States, which could directly regulate the wages of employees in manufacturing, and could enforce that with a penalty for non-compliance. A State could not impose an excise as this power was exclusive to the Commonwealth. It followed in their Honour's judgement that such a penalty, even if calculated by reference to the quantity of articles manufactured, was not an excise, where the purpose was \\"not to raise money for the purposes of government, but to regulate the conditions of labour\\". The Excise Tariff Act was held to be in substance a regulation of the manufacture\\". R v Barger (1908) 6 CLR 41 at p. 74-76 per Grifith CJ, Barton & O'Connor JJ. The decision in this respect has been criticised as a collapse into formalism, holding that 'motive' and 'consequences' were irrelevant while the 'purpose apparent on its face' was relevant. Further a particular tax may have more than one objective. Isaacs and Higgins JJ Isaacs J rejected the substance argument, holding that in the absence of the proviso, the Excise Tariff Act was clearly a tax on the specified machinery, that the proviso did not remove that characterisation and the reason of the legislature was irrelevant to validity.R v Barger (1908) 6 CLR 41 at p. 98 per Isaacs J. Higgins J also rejected the substance argument, holding that as the Act imposed a tax on the production or manufacture of commodities, it was an excise tax, which the Federal Parliament could impose and the State Parliaments could not. The claim the real substance of the act was the regulation of wages referred to either the motives or the legislators or to the consequences of the legislation, neither of which were matters for the Court.R v Barger (1908) 6 CLR 41 at p. 117 per Higgins J. =Discrimination between the states= Section 51(ii) of the Constitution provides that in making laws with respect to taxation, the Commonwealth cannot \\"discriminate between States of parts of States\\". This was the first occasion this issue had been considered by the High Court, although Griffith CJ had previously handed down a decision whilst Chief Justice of Queensland that an excise which exempted goods on which customs or excise duties had been paid under state legislation did not discriminate between the states, holding that \\"[i]f the imposition of these duties leads to an inequality, it is not a defect in the Federal law; it arises from the fact that the laws of the States were different, which is quite another thing\\"Colonial Sugar Refining Co Ltd v Irving [1903] St R Qd 261 This decision was affirmed on appeal by the Privy Council. which held that \\"The rule laid down by the Act is a general one, applicable to all the States alike, and the fact that it operates unequally in the several States arises not from anything done by the Parliament, but from the inequality of the duties imposed by the States themselves\\".. Grifith CJ, Barton and O'Connor JJ The primary finding of the majority was that the Excise Tariff Act was not a law with respect to taxation. Thus the question of whether it discriminated between States could only arise on the hypothesis that the primary finding was wrong and the law was \\"with respect to taxation\\". Their Honours held that \\"The words 'States or parts of States' must be read as synonymous with 'parts of the Commonwealth' or 'different localities within the Commonwealth.'\\" Because the Conciliation and Arbitration Act required the Court to have regard to local circumstances, it followed that the wages payable under an award \\"might vary according to the area within which the manufacture was carried on.\\" and that this was an invalid attempt to authorise discrimination between States and parts of States. In the converse situation to that considered in Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited v Irving \\"if the Excise duty had been made to vary in inverse proportion to the Customs duties in the several States so as to make the actual incidence of the burden practically equal, that would have been a violation of the rule of uniformity\\".R v Barger (1908) 6 CLR 41 at p. 70-1 & 78‚Äì80 per Grifith CJ, Barton & O'Connor JJ. Isaacs and Higgins JJ There are two propositions within the judgment of Isaacs J. The first, later to assume orthodoxy,. was that \\"Discrimination between localities in the widest sense means that, because one man or his property is in one locality, then, regardless of any other circumstance, he or it is to be treated differently from the man or similar property in another locality\\". The second proposition was more controversial, at [36]-[38] per French CJ. in which Isaacs J sought to distinguish parts of a State from parts of the Commonwealth, holding that section 51(i), when read in conjunction with section 99,Section 99 Commonwealth of Australia Constitution: \\"The Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade, commerce, or revenue, give preference to one State or any part thereof over another State or any part thereof.\\" did not require taxation to be uniform throughout the Commonwealth, instead \\"that the treatment that is forbidden, discrimination or preference, is in relation to the localities considered as parts of States, and not as mere Australian localities, or parts of the Commonwealth considered as a single country\\".R v Barger (1908) 6 CLR 41 at p. 106-7 per Isaacs J. This followed the line of reasoning apparent from his earlier statements in Parliament when introducing the Excise Tariff Act, that States Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts could not be recognised as setting 'fair & reasonable' wages without discriminating between the States because they depended on State lines which must be forgotten for the purpose of taxation. The Commonwealth could recognise different rates in different parts of Australia, but not as different State rates. This distinction was one that Dixon CJ described in 1958 as something he had the \\"greatest difficulty in grasping\\". Higgins J reasoned along similar lines to Isaacs J and observed that it would not be discrimination between States or parts of States if a graduated income tax were introduced when incomes were higher in one State than in another.R v Barger (1908) 6 CLR 41 at p. 133 per Higgins J. =Dealing with a matter other than taxation= Section 55 of the constitution provides that \\"laws imposing duties of excise shall deal with duties of excise only\\" and that \\"any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect.\\" Thus if taken literally the effect of s 55 would be that the excise was valid, but the proviso which exempted certain manufacturers from paying the excise was of no effect. The suggestion that the exemption would be of no effect was dealt with in short form by the majority, holding that \\"The proviso in the Act in question cannot, of course, be regarded as 'of no effect,' for to do so would be 'to make a new law, not to enforce an old one'.\\"R v Barger (1908) 6 CLR 41 at p. 77 per Grifith CJ, Barton & O'Connor JJ. Consistent with their opinions that the Excise Act was in substance a tax, neither Isaacs J nor Higgins J needed to deal with the effect of dealing with any other matter. Higgins J put it succinctly that \\"this Act deals only with the imposition of taxation; it taxes, and it defines the persons to be exempted from the tax. This is all it does. There is no \\"provision therein dealing with any other matter.\\" There is no obligation laid on anyone to do anything except to pay the tax.\\"R v Barger (1908) 6 CLR 41 at p. 134 per Higgins J. =Reserved Powers= Grifith CJ, Barton and O'Connor JJ The conclusion of the majority was reached in the shadow of the reserved powers doctrine, in which the grants of power to the Commonwealth in the Constitution should be read in a restrictive way so as to preserve areas that had been intentionally left as the responsibility of the States.... In the course of argument, Griffith CJ stated \\"The express power given to the Commonwealth Parliament to deal with foreign and inter-state trade and commerce implies a prohibition against interfering with interstate trade and commerce, and that must be remembered in dealing with the other powers given.\\" The majority described the applicable rule in this case as \\"different, but ... founded upon the same principles\\", concluding that the power of taxation could not be exercised so as to operate as a direct interference in the internal affairs of the States.R v Barger (1908) 6 CLR 41 at p. 54 per Grifith CJ. Isaacs and Higgins JJ Isaacs J strongly opposed the reserved powers doctrine, holding \\"There can be no derogations from the grant expressly made, except those which are expressly stated or which of necessity inhere. It is an inherent consequence of the division of powers between governmental authorities that neither authority is to hamper or impede the other in the exercise of their respective powers, but that doctrine has no relation to the extent of the powers themselves; it assumes the delimitation aliunde. It is contrary to reason to shorten the expressly granted powers by the undefined residuum\\".R v Barger (1908) 6 CLR 41 at p. 84 per Isaacs J. Higgins J similarly rejected the reserved powers doctrine stating \\"To say that the Federal Parliament cannot make a law because legislation on the subject belongs to the States is rather to invert the true position. The Commonwealth has certain powers, and as to those powers it is supreme; the State has the rest. We must find what the Commonwealth powers are before we can say what the State powers are\\".R v Barger (1908) 6 CLR 41 at p. 113 per Higgins J. Analysis The decision was made before the Engineers case in 1920. swept away the reserved State powers doctrine. The doctrine had been established and affirmed in earlier cases by the original High Court Bench (Griffith CJ, Barton and O'Connor JJ) who were the majority in this decision. The beginnings of the overturning of the doctrine were already evident in the dissenting decision of Isaacs and Higgins, who held that neither the purpose nor the effects of the Act were a valid objection for the exercise of the taxation power. Simply because the law had another purpose did not mean that the law was not one with respect to taxation. The taxation power is a non-purposive power, hence any law that could be encapsulated under the subject matter of taxation would be valid under section 52(ii). The dissent also brought up the notion of dual-characterisation ‚Äì that a law could be characterised several different ways. As long as at least one of the characterisations is pursuant to a head of power, the law would be constitutionally valid.See also .

Image courtesy of NOAA Ocean Explorer The Miami Terrace Reef () is a coral reef off the coast of Florida stretching from South Miami to Boca Raton, in the Atlantic Ocean. It lies in depths of on top of a geological formation known as the Miami Terrace, a long shelf about off shore. Much of the platform remains unexplored, and new portions of the reef are still being discovered. University of Miami researchers discovered new reef sites there in December 2005. The terrace consists of long and well-defined rocky ridges made of limestone that provide a habitat for many types of corals, sponges, and fish. Fish species observed there include wreckfish, barrelfish, and bright red alfonsinos (Beryx decadactylus). Recently observed intertebrate species have included Lophelia pertusa coral, stylasterine hydrocoral (Stylasteridae), bamboo coral (Isididae), and various sponges and octocorals. Motile invertebrates such as crabs and sea urchins have also been observed there, including Asteroporpa sp. ophiuroids, Stylocidaris sp. urchins, Mollusca, Actiniaria, and Decapoda crustaceans (Chaceon fenneri and Galatheidae). Corals on the terrace are vulnerable to the effects of bottom trawling and dredging, and the Miami Terrace has been proposed for protection from these activities. History Studies done primarily by the University of Miami (UM) in the 1970s surveyed the Miami Terrace geological formation. Biologists also retrieved samples of reef fauna. John Reed, with Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution, observed dense aggregations of 50 to 100 wreckfish there in May 2004 during a submersible dive. A UM team with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations Ocean Exploration program discovered new reef sites there in December 2005 using an autonomous underwater vehicle. Conservation The Miami Terrace and other areas of deep sea coral can be damaged by certain kinds of fishing gear such as bottom trawling or dredging. Areas on the Miami Terrace and a series of biogeographically similar areas were approved in 2004 for protection from these activities through the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council but were never finalized. Neighboring coral areas that have also been considered for protection include the Pourtales Terrace to the south, an area known as Savannah-East Florida, and Stetson Reef to the north.

Family History Baba Amar Singh Nibber was born into a Nibber family of Khemkaran. In Sikh history, he is also known as Mahant Singh. His childhood name was Amar Chand but after taking Amrit, he became known as Bhai Amar Singh. His father Raghupat Rai Nibber was a big landlord of Khemkaran and came from a family whose ancestors held royal positions in the Moghul courts. According to Gyani Gyan Singh‚Äôs Panth Parkash also, Baba Amar Singh was of Kamboj lineage. Baba Amar Singh had an elder brother named Mool Chand. Bhai Mool Chand was an excellent soldier and had fought valiantly for Guru Gobind Singh in several battles prior to his martyrdom in the Battle of Nadaun on March 20, 1691. Baba Amar Singh had a very powerful and athletic physique and measured well over six feet and half in height. He was a very fierce and formidable warrior in the battle-field and could continuously wield a double- edged sword (Kharasang or Khanda) weighing over fifty Ser (about twenty kilograms) He was nicknamed as Bir (Knight). Martyrdom of Banda Bahadur During siege of the Lohgarh fort of Banda Bahadur by Mughal forces in 1716, the Sikhs got bifurcated into two divisions: the Bandai Khalsa and the Tat Khalsa whereby the Tat Khalsa parted ways leaving Lohgarh to be defended by the Bandai Khalsa alone. After a long siege, Banda was arrested by Abdus Samad Khan along with his many followers and escorted to Delhi, chained in a cage. On June 9, 1716 he was barbarously executed along with hundreds of Sikhs and became a hallowed martyr in Sikh history. Baba Amar Singh becomes the Bandai Chief After the martyrdom of Banda Bahadur, Baba Amar Singh had assumed the supreme leadership of the Bandai Khalsa faction. Feud among two Panthic war- factions continues After the Lohgarh incidence, the friction between the two Panthic factions continued unabated and at times, there had also occurred minor scuffles between the two. In 1721, Baba Binod Singh Trehan of the Tat Khalsa sent an invitation to the entire Sikh community all over the Punjab to gather at Amritsar on Diwali day. The two factions met at Amritsar and each asserted its claim as being the true heir to Guru Gobind Singh and the Harimandir Sahib. Things looked gloomy for the Sikhs, since both military factions readied themselves for a showdown to assert their individual claims. The dangerous situation was averted at the Diwali occasion by the timely intervention of the Sikh Sangats (Congregations) but both factions continued to entertain anger and ill-will against each other. Bhai Mani Singh appointed as Arbitrator Mata Sundari, the widow of Guru Gobind Singh, came to learn of the trouble brewing between the two military factions at Amritsar. She appointed Bhai Mani Singh as the Granthi of the Harimandir and sent him to Amritsar with Kirpal Singh (Chand), the maternal uncle of Guru Gobind Singh to resolve the feud. The choice on Bhai Mani Singh seems to have fallen for intrinsic reasons also since Bhai Mani Singh, like Baba Baba Amar Singh was of Kamboj lineage and it was therefore hoped that he could better convince Baba Amar Singh and bring him to conciliation in the broader interests of the Khalsa Panth. The feud resolved but...... After assuming office of the Head-Granthi in 1721, Bhai Mani Singh sent invitations to both parties to assemble on the Vaisakhi occasion. Both factions again met at Amritsar in compliance of the invitation from Bhai Mani Singh but with all the malice in their minds set against each other. At Amritsar, the Tat Khalsa took unilateral control of the Akal Bunga while the Jhanda Bunga was taken over by the Bandai Khalsa led by Baba Amar Singh. Using a simplistic but well- intentioned procedure, Bhai Mani Singh was finally able to resolve the feud and restore peace among the warring factions and put the affairs of the Darbar Sahib in order in 1722. The final decision was that the Tat Khalsa was declared the genuine successor to Guru Gobind Singh and the Harimandir Sahib. Death Both parties expressed their agreement and satisfaction over the decision taken by Bhai Mani Singh and the Bandai Khalsa followers of Baba Amar Singh went to join the Tat Khalsa but unexpectedly, at the last moment, trouble flared up and a deadly showdown took place in the very Parikrama of the Harimandir Sahib. Warriors from both sides unsheathed their swords and started to wield them fiercely and relentlessly against their own brethren with all the detachment of a professional soldier. There was great pandemonium and tumult in the Harimandir Prikarma in front of the Akal Takht and many were killed. The war scenes are described in very vivid and full graphic details in the Panth Prakash by Gyani Gyan Singh . Baba Amar Singh wielded his double- edged sword relentlessly and after having slain numerous adversaries, finally, fell dead. The following verse describes the death of Baba Amar Singh: :tad sudhasar that darshani darwaze agey Jang  :Mach gayo masurmedh ka dhar veech keech surang  :kar sees pag bhuj bakh sabal hath majh asaar :chad gayee luthain pe luthain kaat marey jawaan apaar  :Jab jujh dharani pai paryo Singh Amar anekan maar  :Bhag gaye turat Bhandai leeni fateh Singhan maar Legacy Baba Amar Singh was not the first Sikh who died at the hands of fellow Sikhs due to intra-Panthic differences. The phenomenon had been in existence since the time of the Gurus. However, the gory clash which occurred at the Harimandir's Parikrama between the Bandai and the Tat Khalsa would be replicated in the future as schisms would arise in the community and sometimes lead to deadly showdowns as the one involving Baba Amar Singh.

After the Battle of Okinawa in World War II, the United States Navy initially administered the Okinawa group while the other three groups came under Army control. On July 18, 1945 the Navy transferred control to U.S. Army Forces in the Pacific (AFPAC), but on September 21 assumed control again, organizing the United States Military Government of the Ryukyu Islands.Eiji Takemae, The Allied Occupation of Japan, p.123 Finally on July 1, 1946, the Army took control again, organising the Ryukyu Command from the previous Okinawa Base Command. On January 1, 1947 AFPAC was reorganised as Far East Command and a unified Ryukyu Command, including a military government apparatus, was placed under General Headquarters, Far East Command (GHQ FECOM), in Tokyo. In 1952, Japan signed the Treaty of San Francisco and admitted the control of Okinawa by the U.S. government. USCAR, which was a subordinate organization of the forces of the United States, surveilled the Ryukyuan Government and could overrule all the decisions made by the Ryukyuan Government. The official currency was the B yen from 1948‚Äì1958, when the B yen was abolished and the US dollar was brought into use. The government printed Ryukyuan postage stamps and passports. Cars drove on the right in contrast to the main islands of Japan. The island switched to driving on the left in 1978 to bring it in line with Japan. Peace treaty specifications The Seal of United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands Two important articles of the post-war peace treaty of April 28, 1952 are the following: Article 3: Japan will concur in any proposal of the United States to the United Nations to place under its trusteeship system, with the United States as the sole administering authority, Nansei Shoto south of 29 degrees north latitude (including the Ryukyu Islands and the Dait≈ç Shoto), Nanp≈ç Shoto south of Sofu Gan (including the Bonin Islands, Rosario Island and the Volcano Islands) and Parece Vela and Marcus Island. Pending the making of such a proposal and affirmative action thereon, the United States will have the right to exercise all and any powers of administration, legislation and jurisdiction over the territory and inhabitants of these islands, including their territorial waters. Article 4b: Japan recognizes the validity of dispositions of property of Japan and Japanese nationals made by or pursuant to directives of the United States Military Government in any of the areas referred to in Articles 2 and 3. After a formal agreement reached on June 17, 1971, control of Okinawa was given back to Japan on May 15, 1972, and USCAR was abolished. This completed the disposition of this Japanese property by USMG. Government system The post of was created in 1950 and replaced in 1957 by the until 1972. =Governors and High Commissioners= Flag Civil ensign of Ryukyu. The Criminal Code of Ryukyu restricted the flying of any national flags except the flag of the United States. The protesters against the Ryukyu government flew the Hinomaru, the flag of Japan. Civil ships of Ryukyu flew an ensign derived from International maritime signal flag \\"D\\" instead of Japanese or American ensigns. The D ensign was not well known internationally, so the Ryukyuan ships were sometimes seized. The ensign changed to \\"Hinomaru below a triangular flag labeled \\"Ryukyu\\" and \\"ÁêâÁêÉ\\" (Japanese for \\"Ryukyu\\") in 1967.
