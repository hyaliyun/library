Danielle steadily weakened inland and dissipated two days later. Danielle produced widespread rainfall in Louisiana, though few areas reported more than of precipitation. Rainfall was heavier in Texas, peaking at 18.29 inches (465 mm) in Nederland. Much of the damage caused by the storm was as a resulting of flooding. In Port Arthur, twelve homes were damaged, while Interstate 10 was inundated by flood waters. Danielle also spawned several tornadoes in Texas, though none effects from them are unknown. Outside of Texas and Louisiana, the storm also dropped light rainfall in Oklahoma and Mississippi. Overall, Danielle caused three fatalities and at least $25 million (1980 USD) in damage. Meteorological history A tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa on August 22 and tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean. On August 25, the system developed into Tropical Depression Eight. After four days, the depression degenerated back into a tropical wave, which continued westward across the Atlantic. By September 2, the remnants of the depression then interacted with a mid-level low pressure system over southern Florida. As a result, a low- level circulation developed in the Gulf of Mexico as the system as a whole moved off Florida later that day. Organization continued and it is estimated that Tropical Depression Eight at 1800 UTC on September 4, while located about south of New Orleans, Louisiana. The National Hurricane Center began issuing advisories a few hours later. Furthermore, the National Hurricane Center later noted that strengthening was more likely if the depression remained offshore for a longer period of time. Between 0600 and 1100 UTC, a barge known as the Glomar Tender II recorded sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). However, this measurement was deemed to be \\"small scale[d]\\" and not representative of the storm's actual intensity. At 1700 UTC on September 5, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Danielle, based on observations from reconnaissance aircraft and an oil rig. The oil rig, which was location near the coast of Louisiana, reported winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) and a minimum pressure of ; this would later be considered the peak intensity of Danielle. A few hours later, Danielle made landfall near Galveston, Texas at the same intensity. The storm steadily weakened after moving inland and was downgraded to tropical depression by 1200 UTC on September 6. About four hours later, the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories on Danielle. However, the storm did not dissipate until 1200 UTC on September 7, while located near Del Rio, Texas. The remnants of the storm continued westward for the next two days. Preparations and impact=Texas= As the storm was approaching, the National Weather Service issued flash flood watches from Freeport to Sabine Pass, Texas. Rainfall from the storm peaked at in the town of Nederland. A 24-hour precipitation record of was reported at the Southeast Texas Regional Airport in Beaumont. Due to heavy rainfall, an automobile accident in Beaumont resulted in one fatality. A police officer in Beaumont noted that almost every street in the city was flooded. The heavy rainfall resulted in considerable flash flooding in eastern Texas, causing residents to evacuate their homes. Flood waters also forced the shutdown of Interstate 10. According to a police spokesman, at least 60% of streets in Port Arthur were inundated by water. In Orange County, two people were injured in automobile accidents. Along Highway 124, a bayou overflowed its bank. Because there were numerous inundated streets, police barricaded roads in Beaumont, Bridge City, Orange, Vidor, and Port Arthur. A sewer system in Roscoe was also damaged by flood waters, leaving 1,500 residents without running water. In Port Arthur, twelve homes were reported flooded; one house in the Lakeview neighborhood had of water inside. Flood waters entered an oil pit at Port Neches, which sent at least 200 barrels of oil into the Neches River. Danielle also produced tides above normal, causing minor beach erosion along the Texas coast. Several boats and docks on Lake Buchanan were damaged. A third fatality from the storm occurred when a fisherman's boat on Sabine Lake capsized, causing the man to die of a heart attack during rescue. Danielle spawned several tornadoes in the state of Texas, one of which caused an estimated $1,500 (1980 USD) in damage to a storage barn in Galveston County on the Bolivar Peninsula. Another touched down twice in Beaumont and overturned a mobile home at a mobile home park. After the storm, the American Red Cross opened storm shelters for residents forced out of their homes because of the flooding. Due to adverse conditions, \\"hundreds\\" were left without electricity in Beaumont, Silsbee, Kountze, Hamshire, and Fannett. In addition, then President of the United States Jimmy Carter declared Jefferson and Nolan counties as disaster area, allowing those areas to receive federal aid. Damage in Jefferson County alone totaled to $2.7 million (1980 USD). Overall, Danielle caused two fatalities and between $25 million and $50 million (1980 USD) in damage within the state of Texas. =Elsewhere= In the Gulf of Mexico, rough seas from Danielle caused a maintenance barge to capsize, washing all 11 crewmen overboard. A fatality occurred when one of the crewmen drowned, though the other ten were rescued by the United States Coast Guard. Additionally, the storm also caused a United States Coast Guard helicopter to crash into the sea due to high winds and lack of fuel, though all twelve crewmen survived. Offshore, a barge encountered winds of with gusts up to and light rainfall. Danielle’s effects on southern and eastern Louisiana was minimal. The state received moderate to heavy rainfall; there, the highest rainfall total there was in Houma. Light rainfall was also reported in Oklahoma and Mississippi, with no areas reporting at least of precipitation.

The blue-striped white jersey of RFK is worn by two players on the left. Riga FK (Rīgas futbola klubs, short – RFK) was a Latvian football club which was founded December 14, 1923. It was the strongest and most popular Latvian football club in 1920s and 1930s, it was also the base team for Latvia national football team in its early years. It was closed after World War II. The idea for its creation came about in 1922 with the goal of uniting Latvian players on a team which could beat the mostly-German Ķeizarmežs. The founder and manager was Juris Rēdlihs, one of the most active football organizers in Latvia. In 1923, most of the best Latvian footballers from JKS moved to Riga FK. Those included Hermanis Saltups, Ašmanis, Eihmanis, Roga, Bone, Sokolovs, Zemīts and brothers Edvīns, Rūdolfs and Arvīds Bārda. In its first season in the Riga championship Riga FK finished second – one point behind Ķeizarmežs. In 1924 Riga FK had a new manager who also managed the Latvia national football team – V.Malošek from Austria. Because it was prohibited to have foreign citizens playing in the Latvian league for that season, Ķeizarmežs didn't play in 1924. Riga FC easily bet its closest rivals – ASK Riga in the Riga championship and beat the province champions from Cēsis 5–1, winning its first Latvian championship. In 1925 and 1926 Riga FK won its second and third titles. In 1927, Olimpija Liepāja took gold, leaving RFC with second place. Several players (including Arvīds Jurgens, Voldemārs Plade, Česlavs Stančiks and Aleksandrs Ābrams) left Riga FK during this season in order to found a new team – Riga Vanderers. Olimpija also beat RFK in the battle for title in 1928 and 1929. In the 1930s, the emergence of the best pre-war Latvian footballer, Ēriks Pētersons, once again brought good results for Riga FK – with titles in 1930 and 1931. In 1932, however, the team finished in its worst position so far – 3rd behind ASK and Riga Vanderers. The next titles for RK came in 1934 and 1935, when the team beat its competition by a large margin. The last time that RFK won the Latvian title was in 1940, just months before Soviet occupation of Latvia. RFK was then disbanded with its best players joining FK Dinamo Rīga. In 1941, with the German occupation of Latvia, Riga FK and other Latvian football teams were restored and participated in the 1942–1944 championships. The fate of former RFK was different, with some continuing to play football in Soviet Latvia, others emigrating and some being killed in the war. In 1992, the former FK Auda was renamed Riga FK but, after a couple of seasons without serious results, it was renamed Auda again. In 2014 was found Riga Football Club.

The project was constructed in 1939 by 160,000 Uzbek and Tajik collective farm workers from the former Soviet Union and was completed in forty-five days. The canal is 270 kilometers long with over 1,000 hydrotechnical plants located along the waterway, 50 of which are known to be significantly important.Bolshoi Fergana Canal. (n.d.)

Retrieved May 27 2018 from https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Bolshoi+Fergana+Canal269x269px  History  For many centuries prior to Soviet control of the region, water in Central Asia belonged to feudal-bey landlords who made living conditions for peasants in the region harsh; citizens lived in thirst, hunger and poverty and this forced many to flee from the area. The revolution allowed for a reformation of social and economic relations in Central Asia and for all citizens in the region. On September 17 1939, the Pravda Vostoka announced Central Asia's dream of obtaining water a reality though the construction of the Great Fergana Canal. Usman Yusupov, the First Secretary of Central Asian Committee of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan announced that Soviet villages would no longer have a hauz, where drinking water had worms, but would instead have more efficient drainage canals that would prosper the region. The Soviet government along with the expansion of transportation infrastructure and Uzbek soviet citizens who invested in the region transformed a once dry Russian colony into a lively flowering valley that would also serve as a center for Soviet life. The canal symbolized the progress of the union and announced the Soviet Union's future prosperity of the region, it also served example of care and guidance from the Stalinist state towards Central Asian citizens into modern age and socialism.Stronski, Paul.

A negative ecological change that the Great Fergana Canal created was the desiccation of the Aral Sea as a result of poor water management and overuse.  Uses  The main purpose for the canal was to irrigate the cotton fields of the Fergana Valley by the waters of Syr Darya River in efforts to establish agricultural independence from the western cotton market, other crop yields also include vegetables and wheat. In 1940–41, the Northern and Southern Fergana canals were also constructed. As a result, the water supply to the irrigation systems of the valley increased considerably, as did the area irrigated, and the cotton harvest doubled.Bolschoi Fergana Canal. In: Great Soviet Encyclopedia. A translation of the third edition. Vol. 3. Macmillan Inc. New York, Collier Macmillan Publishers London, 1974–1983, p. 438 (Online version at thefreedictionary.com). This irrigation project successfully resulted in massive crop production and led to population increase in the Central Asian region due to industrial settlement in the valley. The canal alone irrigates about 39 percent of the land in the Fergana Valley.Bolshoi Fergana Canal. (n.d.) The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition. (1970-1979).

In media  The construction of Fergana Canal was in the focus of many prominent representatives of the Photography in Uzbekistan such as Max Penson and other Soviet photographers like Mikhail Grachev. Russian screenwriters Pyotr Pavlenko and Sergei Eisenstein wrote a script portraying the history and construction of the Fergana Canal. The script is written as a triptych and begins with an introduction of the violent sacking of Urgench during the 14th century, the second section portrays the riots and the struggle for water access in the valley, and ends with the construction of the canal.Pavlenko, P., Eisenstein, S., & Taylor, R. t.

It took place from 28 July until 10 August 1953. French armored platoons, airborne units and troops delivered by landing craft to the coast of central Annam, modern-day Vietnam, attempted to sweep forces of the communist Viet Minh from the critical Route One. The first landings took place in the early morning on 28 July, and reached the first objectives, an inland canal, without major incident. A secondary phase of mopping-up operations began in a \\"labyrinth of tiny villages\\" where French armored forces suffered a series of ambushes.Fall, 151. Reinforced by paratroopers, the French and their Vietnamese allies tightened a net around the defending Viet Minh, but delays in the movement of French forces left gaps through which most of the Viet Minh guerillas, and many of the arms caches the operation was expected to seize, escaped. For the French, this validated the claim that it was impossible to operate tight ensnaring operations in Vietnam's jungle, due to the slow movement of their troops, and a foreknowledge by the enemy, which was difficult to prevent. From then on, the French focused on creating strong fortified positions, against which Viet Minh General Giáp could pit his forces, culminating in Operation Castor and the Battle of Dien Bien Phu.Fall, 171–173. With the French forces withdrawn from the operation by the late summer of 1953, Viet Minh Regiment 95 re-infiltrated Route One and resumed ambushes of French convoys, retrieving weapons caches missed by the French forces. Regiment 95 occupied the area for the remainder of the First Indochina War and were still operating there as late as 1962 against the South Vietnamese Army during the Second Indochina, or Vietnam War. Background The First Indochina War had raged, as guerrilla warfare, since 19 December 1946. From 1949, it evolved into conventional warfare, due largely to aid from the communists of the People's Republic of China (\\"PRC\\") to the north.Chen Jian, 85–87. Subsequently, the French strategy of occupying small, poorly defended outposts throughout Indochina, particularly along the Vietnamese- Chinese border, started failing.Giáp, 119. Thanks to the terrain, popular support for August Revolution and support for decolonization from bordering China and the U.S.S.R., the Viet Minh had succeeded in turning a \\"clandestine guerrilla movement into a powerful conventional army\\",Windrow (2004), 41–42. following asymmetric warfare theory laid by Mao Tse Tung, something which previously had never been encountered by the western colonial powers.Fall, 17. In October 1952, fighting around the Red River Delta spread into the Thai Highlands, resulting in the Battle of Nà Sản, at which the Viet Minh were defeated. The French used the lessons learned at Nà Sản – strong ground bases, versatile air support, and a model based on the British Burma Campaign – as the basis for their new strategy. The Viet Minh, however, remained unbeatable in the highland regions of Vietnam,Windrow (2004), 121. and the French \\"could not offset the fundamental disadvantages of a roadbound army facing a hill and forest army in a country which had few roads but a great many hills and forests\\".Windrow (2004), 129. In May 1953, General Henri Navarre arrived to take command of the French forces, replacing General Raoul Salan. Navarre spoke of a new offensive spirit in Indochina – based on strong, fast-moving forces – and the media quickly took Operation Camargue to be the \\"practical realization\\" of that. =Chinese and American backing= Following the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the Viet Minh established close ties with China. It enabled the Chinese to expand their area of influence into Indochina and the Viet Minh to receive much-needed Chinese equipment and strategic planning support. From mid-1950, PRC military advisers were seconded to the Viet Minh at battalion, regimental and divisional levels.Chen Jian, 91. The common border meant that \\"China became a 'sanctuary' where the Viet Minh could be trained and refitted\\". When the Korean War broke out, Indochina became \\"an important pawn in Cold War strategy\\". In December 1950, the United States, concerned about growing Chinese Communist influence, started providing military aid to the French, with a first payment of US$15 million.Cogan, 61–62. In the spring of 1953, the Viet Minh launched campaigns in Laos and succeeded in linking up Laotian territorial gains with their bases in north-western Vietnam.Chen Jian, 98–99. Meanwhile, the winding down of the Korean War meant that China was able \\"to give much more attention to its southern neighbour\\". Similarly, the US \\"released from its heavy burden in the Korean conflict ... dramatically increased its military and financial support\\" to the French. By June 1953, the US \\"had sent: 1,224 tanks and combat vehicles; 120,792 rifles and machine guns; more than 200 million rifle and machine gun cartridges; more than five million artillery projectiles; 302 boats and 304 aircraft\\" (by end of the war, total US aid amounted to nearly four billion dollars). Prelude to the battle A model of a typical Viet Minh ambush, using information from Bernard Fall's Street Without Joy, 1961 Route One, also known as Route Coloniale One (or RC1), had been the main north–south artery along the coastline of Vietnam since the outbreak of violence in 1949. Communications and convoys along these lines suffered from regular attacks by Viet Minh irregulars,Windrow (2004), 102. despite efforts by the French during 1952 in Operation Sauterelle.Dunstan, 9. The Viet Minh paramilitary forces around Route One originated mainly from a region of fortified villages dispersed along sand dunes and salt marshes between Hué to the south, and Quang Tri to the north.Fall, 144. French forces had suffered from Viet Minh ambushes, an attack that the latter had become very proficient at throughout the war, most notably in the annihilation of Group Mobile 42 in 1950 and of GM 100 in 1954.Fall, 242. The roads in Vietnam were almost all closed during the night and \\"abandoned to the enemy\\". Between 1952 and 1954, 398 armored vehicles were destroyed, 84% of them from mines and booby traps.Fall, 354. Typically, the Viet Minh ambushed convoys by obstructing the road with a fallen tree or pile of boulders, and then destroying the first and last vehicles of the halted convoy with remote mines.Dunstan, 15. Caltrops, mines and the steep cliff faces naturally found at the road side aided in funneling the target convoy into a small area, where machine guns, mortars and recoilless rifles were trained.Fall, 54. Viet Minh Regiment 95 repeatedly deployed these tactics, inflicting severe losses on the French forces passing along Route One, which led to its French nickname of la rue sans joie (\\"the Street Without Joy\\"). Regiment 95 was, along with regiments 18 and 101, part of the Viet Minh Division 325, commanded by General Tran Quy Ha. The division was formed in 1951 from pre-existing units in Thừa Thiên just north of Route One, and became operational in the summer of 1952. By early summer 1953, thanks in part to the wind-down of hostilities in the Korean War, the French command had \\"sufficient reserves\\" at hand to begin clearing the Viet Minh back from Route One. They assembled 30 battalions, two armored regiments and two artillery regiments for one of the largest operations of the conflict. Called Operation Camargue, it was named for the sandy marshland to the west of Marseille, France. The difficult terrain was to prove the decisive factor and gave a major advantage to the one Viet Minh regiment tasked with defending Route One. French soldiers fight off a Viet Minh ambush in 1952. The ambushes cost the French nearly 400 armoured vehicles between 1952 and 1954. From a deep beach of \\"hard sand\\" the French landing forces were to advance through a series of dunes. The dunes were up to high and interspersed with precipices, ditches and a handful of small villages. Beyond this was an belt of pagodas and temples, which war correspondent Bernard Fall described as having excellent defensive potential. Beyond these temples was Route One itself with a series of closely packed and fortified villages, including Tân An, Mỹ Thủy, Van Trinh and Lai-Ha.Fall, 146. This network of villages and hedgerows made both ground and air surveillance difficult. Across from Route One the villages continued amid an area of quicksand, swamps and bogs, which would stop all but a few of the vehicles at the disposal of the French. Although there were roads, most were mined or damaged. Throughout the area, the civilian population remained and provided a further complication for the French high command.Fall, 147. =French order of battle= The French divided their forces into four groupement mobiles (\\"mobile groups\\"): A through D. Group A consisted of Mobile Group 14, which contained 3rd Amphibious Group, 2nd Marine Commando, 2nd Battalion 1st Colonial Parachute Regiment, and 3rd Vietnamese Parachute Battalion. Operation Camargue was to be one of the final proving grounds for the use of French armour during the war.Dunstan, 23. It was to land on the beach in line with the center of Route One. Meanwhile, Group B was to advance over land from the west of the north-east facing beach. This group consisted of Mobile Group Central Vietnam's 6th Moroccan Spahis, 2nd Amphibious Group, a tank platoon from 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment, and two infantry companies from the Quang-Tri military base. Group C was to advance from the south-west into the back of Van Trinh through the swamps, and consisted of the 9th Moroccan Tabor, 27th Vietnamese Infantry Battalion, 2nd Battalion of the 4th Moroccan Rifle Regiment, 1 Commando, a tank platoon of the Moroccan Colonials, an armoured patrol boat platoon, and an LCM platoon. Group D consisted of 3rd Battalion of the 3rd Algerian Rifles, the 7th Amphibious Group, and a commando group, and was to land at the south-east end of the beach, below Group A.Fall, 144–146. These forces in total formed \\"two amphibious forces, three land-borne groupments and one airborne force\\" all of which was commanded by General Leblanc. Securing Route One=French landing= American marines to the beaches of Iwo Jima. On 27 July 1953, the French landing craft departed from their assembly points, and by 04:00 on the following had begun disembarking 160 amphibious landing craft belonging to Group A's 3rd Amphibious opposite the coastline. By 06:00, these vehicles had landed on the beach and proceeded to occupy sand ridges overlooking the dunes beyond. Proceeding into the dunes, the vehicles of 3rd Amphibious became stuck in the sand; in the meantime, other regular infantry elements of Group A were experiencing more difficulties in the sea, taking two extra hours to reach the beach. Thus unsupported, elements of 3rd Amphibious that either disembarked floundering vehicles or were pushed, managed to escape the dunes and advance between Tân An and Mỹ Thủy.Fall, 149. The French amphibious vehicles were the World War II-era 29-C cargo carriers, nicknamed the \\"crab\\" or \\"crabe\\" and LVT 4 or 4As, known as \\"alligators\\". The latter were armed with two and two Browning machine guns and an M20 recoilless rifle.Dunstan, 21. While the alligators were sufficiently armoured and well suited to the water, they struggled on land. In contrast, the crab had difficulty in water and its large size presented too great a target on land; however, it was lighter and more maneuverable,Fall, 148. except in paddy fields where its suspension became clogged with vegetation.Dunstan, 20. While Group A's forward elements were breaching the dune barrier unopposed, two of Group B's battalions crossed the Van Trịnh Cănal. By 07:45, when they made visual contact with the crabs and alligators of Group A, they had succeeded in sealing off the northern escape route of By 08:30, the 6th Moroccan Spahis also reached the canal, having had difficulty crossing the swamps on the landward side with their M24 Chaffee tanks. No French units, as yet, had made any major contact with the Viet Minh. A minor fire-fight had taken place on the southern edge of advance when an Algerian company exchanged fire with 20–30 Viet Minh and suffered the first French fatalities.Fall, 150. Simultaneously, had advanced into the center of the area of operation, and executed \\"the most complicated maneuver of the operation\\". This involved crossing Route One and sealing off the land side of the operational area, and was completed by 08:30. Group D, finally, was tasked with advancing south from its landing point to close off an escape route that ran between the sea and an inland lagoon towards the city of Hué. Landing at 04:30, the group made quick progress through the beach and dunes, secured the small city of Thé Chi Dong and hit the north coast of the lagoon by 05:30, thereby sealing off that escape route with no enemy contact. The final act of sealing the noose was to move some of the French Navy vessels north to the Vietnamese villages of Ba-Lang and An-Hoi where any attempt by Regiment 95 to flee by sea would have taken place. =Tightening the loop= Pro-French Vietnamese soldiers, like these shown here treating a Viet Minh prisoner, formed part of the French landing forces in Operation Camargue. With the landings and the encirclement of Regiment 95 complete and the net deemed secure, the French forces began the second phase of the operation and began to sweep through the area for the encircled Viet Minh. Each French group began to move through the villages around Route One in an attempt to locate the Viet Minh forces. Group B, which was lined up along the canal – the jump-off point for the second phase of the operation – moved to sweep the northern villages while Group C did the same further south. The method of searching each village was to seal it off entirely with encircling troops, and then inspect it with a heavily armed unit of minesweepers and K-9 teams. Men of military age were arrested and screened by intelligence officers. This process was time- consuming, and by 11:00 Group B had traveled through the network of villages with no results or resistance. At this time, the 6th Moroccan Spahis entered the village of Dong-Qué with their M-24 tanks and the support of the 1st Battalion of the Moroccan Rifles and the artillery of Colonel Piroth (later commander of the artillery at the battle of Dien Bien Phu) and his 69th African Artillery Regiment.Windrow (2004), 309. M24-Chaffee tanks accompanied the French in Operation Camargue. Though they have a top speed of 25 mph (40 km/h) off-road, the French found progress particularly slow in the boggy landscape inland of Route One. The Moroccan infantry took the lead, and the French commanders sealed themselves in their tank turrets and advanced behind. Viet Minh forces, which were waiting in ambush, fired almost the same instant as the lead Moroccan units who noticed their presence. The Moroccan forces spread out into the surrounding rice paddies, and the bazookas of the Viet Minh missed the French tanks. The French commander called in Piroth's artillery and Dong-Qué \\"disintegrated under the impact of their high-angle fire\\", particularly when a French shell found the Viet Minh ammunition depot.Fall, 162. As the French tanks approached, the Viet Minh drove the civilians out to clog up the entrance to the village, however as the Viet Minh retreated they were spotted through the civilians by the Moroccan infantry and killed by 13:00. During this battle, however, most of the Regiment 95 personnel who had been elsewhere managed to escape towards the southern end of the French encirclement. Leblanc had realized the intentions of Regiment 95's commander, and had requested one of the two reserve paratroop units to be deployed at the border between the network of temples and the dune-filled area in front of where Group D had originally landed. This paratroop unit, 2nd Battalion of the 1st Colonial Parachute Regiment, began to advance towards the canal at 10:45, 15 minutes before Group B entered Dong-Qué. Group C's 9th Tabor had also, like the M-24s of Group B, struggled through the marshes during the first phase of the operation, and were late in arriving at the jumping-off point for phase two, the canal. At 08:45, Moroccan units of Group C were investigating the village of Phu An on the opposite side of the lagoon from Group D's landing area, when they came under heavy fire. Despite being nearer to Group D, the engaged units radioed their immediate commanders back in Group C, who were by now some distance away, further inland. This delay, coupled with the failure of many of the units' SCR300 radios, meant that these advance elements of Group C failed to get through until 09:10. At 09:40, the commander of Group C called up various reinforcements from Hué including two companies of Vietnamese trainee NCOs and five infantry companies, two of which came via landing craft and did not reach the beleaguered elements of Group C until 18:00, half an hour after the Moroccans had finally counter-attacked and occupied Phu-An.Fall, 164. The 2nd Battalion of the Parachute Chasseurs RegimentWindrow (2004), 236.Windrow (1998), 44. had been requested to drop at 14:00 to support the advanced elements of Group C but did not jump until 16:50 and thus failed to assemble before the Moroccans themselves occupied Phu- An.Fall, 165. With the final capture of Phu-An, the extreme southern tip of the encirclement, the pincer movement was complete.Fall, 166. =Escape of Regiment 95= French troops sweeping paddy fields, similar to those through which Regiment 95 escaped By 17:30, with Phu-An captured, all French reserves now committed, and one half of the pocket fully swept by groups B and A at the northern end of the battlefield, the French appeared to have gained the upper hand. By now, the expected windfall of arms caches and prisoners should have taken place. However, the unexpected time taken to capture Phu-An, and the delayed arrival of the paratroop reinforcements who had been scattered by the winds, had left a gap between Phu-An and the southern edge of the lagoon. This gap was eventually covered by only four French battalions, leaving gaps through which the Viet Minh could escape. Crabs and alligators were stationed on, or in some cases in, the canal network, and French infantry were scattered across the edge of the pocket throughout that night in order to detect escaping Viet Minh. However, despite the occasional shot, flare and searchlight, no Viet Minh were detected.Fall, 167. On the morning of 29 July 1953, the French forces continued to advance into the remaining pocket, encountering neither Viet Minh nor civilian.The Times (1953a), 5. Groups A, B and D reached the edge of the canal opposite Group C by 13:00, having retrieved a small number of suspected Viet Minh and a \\"few weapons\\".Fall, 168. At this time, however, a Morane aircraft detected the movement of elements of Regiment 95 towards An-Hoi on the extreme northern corner of the operational area, outside of the pocket. The French carried out a raid on An-Hoi by commando groups and elements of Group A, which took place at 15:00 and returned with suspected Viet Minh by 18:00. The French then undertook a methodical house-to-house search of the entire area, sweeping each village, and the surrounding paddy fields and jungle, risking encounter with Viet Minh caltrops. Meanwhile, 2nd and 3rd amphibious used their crabs and alligators to herd prisoners towards Trung-An for interrogation. By the end of 29 July, with resistance to the French forces having ceased, a general withdrawal of paratroopers, amphibious groups and marines began.The Times (1953b), 7.Fall, 169. Aftermath=Rebuilding and reaction= After the departure of all but regular French infantry, efforts to make the area suitable for permanent occupation by French forces and French-friendly civilians began. This involved the rebuilding of road and rail links (Vietnam's North–South railway ran alongside Route One), the repairing of infrastructure, demining, the installation of new Vietnamese government administrators, and the provision of \\"everything from rice to anti-malaria tablets\\".Fall, 170. Over 24 villages were placed under the authority of the Vietnamese government, and Regiment 95 had been driven from the area.Chaliand, 132. In comparison to Fall, South Vietnamese general Lâm Quang Thi states in his memoirs that Operation Camargue was \\"one of the most successful French military operations during the Indochina war\\" in the area of Route One.Thi, 337. Newspapers stated that the operation had been a \\"total success, demonstrating once more the new aggressiveness and mobility\\" of the French forces. However, in the days following the end of the fighting, press reports on the French failure to capture the anticipated large numbers of Viet Minh began to appear though the British newspaper, The Times, did publish claimed casualty figures of 1,550 for the Viet Minh, 200 of which were killed. This estimate was altered by the French the next day to 600 killed or wounded and 900 captured, and it was suggested that the operation did \\"not appear to have been successful\\".The Times (1953c), 5. In contrast to these figures, Bernard Fall records 182 Viet Minh casualties and 387 prisoners. He also notes that \\"51 rifles, eight sub- machine guns, two mortars, and five BARs\\" were captured. Of the prisoners, however, it is not recorded how many were confirmed to be members of Regiment 95. Both Fall and the newspapers published in the days following the official termination of the operation on 10 August 1953, give French casualties as 17 dead and 100 wounded. Giáp wrote \\"it was announced we suffered heavy losses although in fact our losses were insignificant ... their troops had to withdraw with heavy losses\\".Giáp, 121. Fall goes on to record that the \\"major defect\\" of Operation Camargue was that the French had nothing like the numerical superiority to encircle a force in the terrain around Road One, 15:1 as opposed to the 20:1 or 25:1 that he believed required. He states that the slow French progress (around 1,500 yards an hour) and the large distances each unit had to guard from Viet Minh infiltration meant that the Viet Minh could easily escape the net. He also states that Viet Minh intelligence were always aware of French movements, as the size of French units and the complex technology involved in the operation gave its presence and intentions away almost immediately, whereas in contrast the simpler Viet Minh operations were far more difficult to detect.Fall, 172. =Route One and Regiment 95= Regiment 95 survived Operation Camargue and resumed ambushes in 1954, as well as assaulting a Vietnamese garrison near Hué. The regiment remained in the area, taking part in General Giáp's 1954 campaign season, until Vietnam was split into North and South Vietnam by the cease-fire, whereupon it infiltrated back to the north along Route One during broad daylight,Windrow (2004), 262. leaving small cells of guerillas in the area.Humphries, 214. The regiment returned to resume ambushes of the South Vietnamese Army in 1962. NotesReferences Printed sources: * Chaliand, Gérard. 1982.

PCC is the oldest Chinese Filipino secondary school in the Philippines. It is a non-stock, non-profit, and non- sectarian co-educational education institution offering pre-school, and has a Level II re-accredited status from the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU) for its grade school and high school. Its programs emphasize in the English, Filipino, and Mandarin Chinese languages, Mathematics, Science, and Information Technology. School History http://www.philippineculturalcollege.edu.ph/history.htm=The Pioneering Stagehttp://www.philippineculturalcollege.edu.ph/history.htm= The school was originally named Philippine Chinese High School. It was established by the Philippine Chinese Educational Association in 1923, under the leadership of Don Carlos Palanca, Sr. With 47 students, classes were first held using the two classrooms of Anglo Chinese School (now Tiong Se Academy). Classes started on June 27, thus the date became the foundation day of the school. In 1937, the first batch of alumni organized the PCHS Alumni Association, with Mr. Go Seng Guan elected as the first president. He was succeeded by Mr. Kong Kuan. In 1938, the school was authorized by the Educational Association to organize a board of trustees which would take over the management of the school. Mr. Go Chong Beng was the first chairman of the board. For 15 years, Mr. Chow Cing Chian, Mr. Tsai Xiang Chang, Mr. Tiu See Eng, Mr. King She Hiong, Mr. Shu Seng Shan, and Mr. Huang Meng Kuei served as school principal one after another. =Surmounting Difficulties= In 1939, Teng Chiu Huang served as the 7th school principal. In 1940, a new school building was constructed along Jose Abad Santos Street. Classes were held both at the new building and at the old building of Anglo Chinese School. In January 1942, the Imperial Japanese Army invaded the City of Manila. The new school building was forcibly occupied by the Japanese troops. Classes were suspended. In May 1945, the school was the first one within the city to reopen after the war. In 1948, expansion of the Abad Santos school building was completed. The old school building was turned over to Anglo Chinese School. On May 2, 1949, at 11:30 in the evening, a neighborhood fire brought disaster to the school. The whole school building, together with all the important records and papers, and facilities were burned to ashes. Under the leadership of T.C. Huang and Sy Eng, the president of the Educational Association and at the same time the chairman of the board of trustees, efforts were exerted and donations from various sectors of the Chinese community were gathered. On November 11 of that same year, a new school building was finally completed. =The Struggling Years= On November 11, 1960, T.C. Huang died after serving as the principal for 20 years. On December 8 of that same year, the Board of Trustees appointed Go Seng Guan as the principal. In 1961, using the funds from Dr. T. C. Huang Memorial Foundation, the school bought a 10,000 square meter Caloocan Campus property in Caloocan City. On November 8, 1963, Sy Eng, the chairman of the board of trustees, died. Chung Tiong Tay succeeded him. In 1967, the Department of Education approved the construction of an Caloocan campus in Caloocan City. Classes were held in June of that same year, with more than 300 students. In 1976, the government Filipinized all Chinese schools in the Philippines. The school was renamed Philippine Cultural High School. Since its founding, Philippine Cultural High School used to offer only high school education. But with the changing of times, both the Manila and the Caloocan campuses started offering pre-school and elementary education during the 70s. The activities of the Alumni Association were suspended due to the uncertainty of times. PCHS Alumni Coordinating Committee, with Marcos Chua as the liaison officer, was organized instead to help contact alumni from all places. In 1976, the Alumni Association was re-organized, with Chuang Chong Chian as the president. In 1978, the Alumni Association successfully assisted the Board of Trustees in the fund raising campaign for the expansion project of the Caloocan campus. =Development Stage= In the 1980s, the Board of Trustees, the Alumni Association, and the school authorities realized the imperative need for further development in order to meet the demands of the changing times. Taking the suggestion of the principal, Mr. Go Seng Guan, the reconstruction of the school building in the Manila campus started under the leadership of Mr. Chung Tiong Tay, the chairman of the board of trustees. After five years of patience and hardwork, a towering new school building proudly stood along Jose Abad Santos Street. On January 11, 1986, while the construction of the main school building was on its peak, Mr. Go Seng Guan died. He was 80 years old. He served the school for 50 years. In that same year, the Board of Trustees appointed Dr. Fernando Gan as the 9th principal of the school. Mr. Emilio Gan was appointed assistant principal of Manila Campus while Ms. Susana Bairan was appointed as the assistant principal of the Caloocan Campus respectively. In June 1988, the new school building in the Manila campus was inaugurated. To commemorate this event, the cultural show “An Odyssey” was staged. After the completion of the new school building, the president of the Alumni Association, Mr. John Tan, spearheaded the fund-raising campaign for the “PCHS Faculty and Staff Mutual Aid Fund”. In 1989, the Board of Trustees organized the PCHS Educational Foundation to ensure the effective management of these endowments. In 1989, Dr. Fernando Gan had to resign as principal because of failing health. The Board of Trustees promoted Mr. Emilio Gan as the 10th principal of the school. Ms. Susana Bairan remained the assistant principal. In 1990, realizing that the quality of Chinese education had deteriorated, and that the instructional materials had become old and obsolete, Mr. Chung Tiong Tay, the chairman of the board, used his personal money to hire experts to revise and prepare instructional materials that would suit the needs of the local students. With this, Mr. Gan introduced “Teaching / Learning Chinese as a Secondary Language”, the latest pedagogy developed specifically for non- native speakers. In 1991, spearheaded by the several members of the Board of Trustees and directors of the Alumni Association, the Philippine Chinese Education Research Center was established. It was tasked to promote reforms in the Chinese language teaching within the country. A 10-million peso seed fund was collected from the alumni and generous patrons. To uplift the quality of education and improve the instructional facilities, our school applied for PAASCU. Both the Manila and the Caloocan campuses were granted Level II accreditation status for five years. After Dr. Chuang Chong Chian, the Alumni Association went under the leadership of Mr. Ang Cheng Tionsu, Ms. Bee Keng Elena Cu Uy Gam, Mr. John Tan, Ms. Mary Lim, Mr. Eduardo Chua, Ms. Pilar Ongking, Dr. Tan King King, Ms. Janet Kopio, Mr. Alfredo Lu, Mr. Peter Gaisano, Mr. Sy Uliong, Mr. Angel Tan and the incumbent Ms. Diana To. They have all contributed significantly to the alma mater and the Alumni Association. After An Odyssey, the school came up with other equally remarkable performances, such as The Blooming Sunflowers (1990), D’ Little Twinkling Stars (1992), Salinlahi (1993), Pagdiriwang (1998), Tomorrow's Promise (2000), PCHS at 80 (2003), and The Golden Cradle (2005), and March On, PCHS (2008) etc. In 1994, Ms. Susana Bairan, the assistant principal, retired from office. She had served the school untiringly for 27 years. Upon her retirement, she was appointed as a member of the board of trustees. At the same time, the Board of Trustees appointed Mr. Antonio O as the Officer-In- Charge (OIC) of the Caloocan campus. The Board of Trustees passed a resolution to construct a modern 4-story Kindergarten Building on the Caloocan campus. In 1995, the Kinder Day Care was established. In 1999, a Science Building was constructed on the Caloocan campus. After more than 30 years of selfless dedication to his beloved alma mater, Mr. Chung retired as the chairman of the board of trustees in May 2000. Mr. John Tan succeeded him as the chairman of the board of trustees. In 2001, Mr. Antonio O retired as the OIC of the Caloocan campus. The Board of Trustees appointed Ms. Yolanda Que as the administrative head of the Caloocan campus until 2008. In 2002, Dr. Chuang Chong Chian succeeded Mr. John Tan as the chairman of the board of trustees. At the same time, the Board appointed Dr. Sining Marcos Kotah as the administrative head of the Manila campus, assisting the principal in taking charge of the Manila campus. Aside from developing its curriculum, the school also established sister school relations with schools in China like Huaqiao University, Jin Jiang Nan Qiao Middle School, Shi Shi No. 8 Middle School, Shi Shi No. 3 Middle School, Shi Shi Experimental School, Qiao Sheng Middle School, Ying Lin Middle School, etc. Both parties have established a long term relation, interacting regularly, helping each other towards the continuous improvement of their educational standards. In 2004, Mr. Eduardo Chua succeeded Dr. Chuang Chong Chian as the chairman of the board of trustees. In 2006, Ms. Bee Keng Elena Cu Uy Gam succeeded Mr. Eduardo Chua, and became the first female chairman of the board of trustees. During her term, she started working on the application for the opening of the college department. In 2008, Ms. Pilar Ongking succeeded Ms. Bee Keng Elena Cu Uy Gam as the chairman of the board of trustees. Mr. Emilio Gan, after 38 years of dedicated service to the school, retired from office. He was appointed as a member of the B.O.T. On the same year, the school opened its college and changed its name to Philippine Cultural College (PCC). At the same time, the school changed its organizational structure, with the president being the highest in office and a vice president each for the college and the basic education departments. Dr. Lily Go was named president of Philippine Cultural College and Dr. Sining M. Kotah as vice president of the secondary, elementary and kinder departments of both the Manila and the Caloocan campuses. A new college building was proposed, to be constructed on a lot donated by Mr. Benito Cu and Ms. Elena Cu Uy Gam in Quezon City. Ground-breaking ceremony was held on January 15, 2012. On the same year, Mr. Angel Tan succeeded Ms. Pilar Ongking as the chairman of the board of trustees. In June 2013, there was a grand celebration to commemorate to celebrate the 90th anniversary of Philippine Cultural College.

More precisely, let :E_2^{p,q} \\\\Rightarrow H^n(A) be a first quadrant spectral sequence, meaning that E_2^{p,q} vanishes except when p and q are both non- negative. Then there is an exact sequence :0 -> E21,0 -> H 1(A) -> E20,1 -> E22,0 -> H 2(A). Here, the map E_2^{0,1} \\\\to E_2^{2,0} is the differential of the E_2-term of the spectral sequence. Example *The inflation-restriction exact sequence ::0 -> H 1(G/N, AN) -> H 1(G, A) -> H 1(N, A)G/N -> H 2(G/N, AN) ->H 2(G, A) :in group cohomology arises as the five-term exact sequence associated to the Lyndon–Hochschild–Serre spectral sequence ::H p(G/N, H q(N, A)) ⇒ H p+q(G, A) :where G is a profinite group, N is a closed normal subgroup, and A is a G-module. Construction The sequence is a consequence of the definition of convergence of a spectral sequence. The second page differential with codomain E21,0 originates from E2−1,1, which is zero by assumption. The differential with domain E21,0 has codomain E23,−1, which is also zero by assumption. Similarly, the incoming and outgoing differentials of Er1,0 are zero for all . Therefore the (1,0) term of the spectral sequence has converged, meaning that it is isomorphic to the degree one graded piece of the abutment H 1(A). Because the spectral sequence lies in the first quadrant, the degree one graded piece is equal to the first subgroup in the filtration defining the graded pieces. The inclusion of this subgroup yields the injection E21,0 -> H 1(A) which begins the five-term exact sequence. This injection is called an edge map. The E20,1 term of the spectral sequence has not converged. It has a potentially non-trivial differential leading to E22,0. However, the differential landing at E20,1 begins at E2−2,2, which is zero, and therefore E30,1 is the kernel of the differential E20,1 -> E22,0. At the third page, the (0, 1) term of the spectral sequence has converged, because all the differentials into and out of Er0,1 either begin or end outside the first quadrant when . Consequently E30,1 is the degree zero graded piece of H 1(A). This graded piece is the quotient of H 1(A) by the first subgroup in the filtration, and hence it is the cokernel of the edge map from E21,0. This yields a short exact sequence :0 -> E21,0 -> H 1(A) -> E30,1 -> 0\\\\. Because E30,1 is the kernel of the differential E20,1 -> E22,0, the last term in the short exact sequence can be replaced with the differential. This produces a four-term exact sequence. The map H 1(A) -> E20,1 is also called an edge map. The outgoing differential of E22,0 is zero, so E32,0 is the cokernel of the differential E20,1 -> E22,0. The incoming and outgoing differentials of Er2,0 are zero if , again because the spectral sequence lies in the first quadrant, and hence the spectral sequence has converged. Consequently E32,0 is isomorphic to the degree two graded piece of H 2(A). In particular, it is a subgroup of H 2(A). The composite E22,0 -> E32,0 -> H2(A), which is another edge map, therefore has kernel equal to the differential landing at E22,0. This completes the construction of the sequence. Variations The five-term exact sequence can be extended at the cost of making one of the terms less explicit. The seven-term exact sequence is :0 -> E21,0 -> H 1(A) -> E20,1 -> E22,0 -> Ker(H 2(A) -> E20,2) -> E21,1 -> E23,0. This sequence does not immediately extend with a map to H3(A). While there is an edge map E23,0 -> H3(A), its kernel is not the previous term in the seven-term exact sequence. For spectral sequences whose first interesting page is E1, there is a three- term exact sequence analogous to the five-term exact sequence: :0 \\\\to H^0(A) \\\\to E_1^{0,0} \\\\to E_1^{0,1}. There are also low degree exact sequences for homological spectral sequences, as well as for spectral sequences in the third quadrant. When additional terms of the spectral sequence are known to vanish, the exact sequences can sometimes be extended further. For example, the long exact sequence associated to a short exact sequence of complexes can be derived in this manner.

He played 173 games for Leicester Tigers between 2005-17 winning four Premiership Rugby titles, played 40 times for between 2008-2015, was part of the squad for the 2011 Rugby World Cup, and was a tourist with the British and Irish Lions in 2009 to South Africa and 2013 to Australia. Background Born 7 November 1985 in Basingstoke, England, Croft went to Oakham School in Rutland where he was in the same year as England cricketer Stuart Broad. Playing style Croft's best position was blindside flanker, he was known for his line-out agility and unusual speed for a forward; one of the quickest players in the Tigers squad his coach Aaron Mauger described him as the \\" fastest loose forward he had ever seen\\". After scoring two tries against his Harlequins side in 2008 Dean Richards described Croft as an \\"outstanding talent\\" who \\"has everything\\", Martin Corry said have never had a player blessed with Croft's abundant abilities. Club career His senior debut for Leicester Tigers came against Gloucester in the 2005–06 season, a week after he turned 20. In the following season, which included a Premiership title and the Anglo-Welsh Cup for the Tigers, he made 16 appearances. 2008–09 could be considered Croft's breakthrough season, in which he established himself both in the club side and on the international scene. He was man-of-the-match in the Heineken Cup semi- final against Cardiff Blues, which resulted in a historic sudden death kicking competition. The shoot-out ended before Croft's turn came up as Jordan Crane made the winning kick. Although the Tigers fell at the final hurdle of the Heineken Cup, they won the 2008–09 Guinness Premiership. Croft played lock in both finals, as a result of injury to teammate Louis Deacon. The following season didn't quite match up to the previous for Croft, due in no small part to the two knee injuries he sustained, one after the other in the middle of the season. He worked his way back successfully, however, and featured in another Premiership final victory, this time at blindside flanker. He captained the Tigers for the first time on 3 October 2010, against Saracens. Croft suffered two major injuries whilst on club duty. First, in an April 2012 Premiership match against Harlequins Croft mistimed tackle on Nick Easter and suffered a triple fracture of his C6 vertebra, a specialist described the injury \\"as close as you can to being paralysed”, He returned to the Tigers after 8 months injured in January 2013 against Worcester. In 2013 Croft played in his third victorious Premiership final. Then, in the 2013–14 Premiership opener against Worcester in September, he suffered a season-ending cruciate ligament injury. In November 2017, Croft announced his immediate retirement from rugby following a new neck injury and consulting a specialist. His final appearance was on 11 March 2017 against Saracens in the semi final of the Anglo-Welsh Cup, Croft was a substitute as Leicester won 32-10. International career Croft was called up to the England squad for the 2008 Six Nations Championship. He had already been selected for the England Saxons and England Sevens sides. He gained his first England cap in the 2008 Six Nations win against France in Paris. He was then named in Martin Johnson's squad on 1 June 2008. He gained starting places in the squad at blindside flanker for three games against the Pacific Islanders, and , before being named on the bench against . Croft was awarded man of the match when England defeated 34–10 at Twickenham in the 2009 Six Nations Championship. On 20 May 2009, he was called up to the squad by coach Ian McGeechan for the Lions 2009 tour of South Africa as a replacement for the banned Alan Quinlan. He then subsequently started the first two tests against , and came off the bench in the 3rd test. He scored two tries in the first test defeat – becoming the first Lions forward to score twice against the Springboks. In November 2009, Croft was nominated for the IRB Player of the Year for 2009, though the award went to Richie McCaw. Despite making the shortlist and having started the first two games of the Autumn Internationals, Croft found himself demoted to the bench for the third test, against . Injury to Joe Worsley saw him take the field within the first five minutes, however. Croft's second knee injury in the 2009–10 season saw him miss out on the 2010 Six Nations entirely, though he regained his starting place from James Haskell for the Australian summer tour. He switched to openside flanker to cover injured captain Lewis Moody halfway through the second half of the first Test, which England lost 27–17. The second Test saw England beat Australia 20–21. This was only the third time that England had managed to beat Australia in Australia. He took part in the 2010 Autumn Internationals, starting in both the loss to and the win against , the latter cited by many to have been the best England performance for years. In 2011 he was part of the England team that came within a game of a grand slam. 2012 saw Croft play in every single game of that year's Six Nations, His form continued to improve throughout the Championship and he played a starring role in the game against France which saw him score a wonderful try after a searing burst of pace. The last game against Ireland, saw him make a 50-yard burst which almost brought about a try. Croft was ruled out of the rest of Leicester's season after a neck injury. His first try for came as a replacement for James Haskell against . In April 2013, he was selected for the 2013 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia. He started the first test in a 23–21 win over Australia and came off the bench in the 16–15 second test defeat. He made his international return two years later for England during the 2015 Six Nations against Italy and Ireland, his last cap to date.

Hutchinson, who would later see success with \\"American Film Manufacturing Company\\", which was formed in 1910 with Western Film Exchange owner John Frueler.Silent Era : PSFL : Companies : American Film Manufacturing Company, Incorporated Hite's company name was then changed to \\"H & H Film Service Company\\". By this time he had married his wife, Marjorie, with whom he would have two daughters.  Major purchases, obtaining Thanhouser Corporation  Hite bought stock in American Film Manufacturing, and afterward purchased the Globe, Royal, and Union film companies, forming the Majestic Film Exchange. When he learned that the successful Thanhouser Company might be for sale, he approached Edwin Thanhouser, and he and his partners purchased that company for $250,000 on April 15, 1912, in a transaction arranged by Mutual Film Corporation. Following the purchase, Hite was named president of the Thanhouser Film Corporation. Under Hite's leadership, the company would see numerous successes in its films. In 1911, Edwin Thanhouser had obtained actress Florence La Badie, who would become Thanhouser Corporation's most profitable film star. In 1914, Hite cast La Badie in the serial The Million Dollar Mystery, which would become highly successful. By mid-1914, Hite was listed by Photoplay magazine as one of its twelve featured millionaires. During this period, Thanhouser Film Corporation was at its height.  Death  On August 21, 1914, Hite was on the way to his home in New Rochelle, New York and was crossing the viaduct at 155th Street in Manhattan when his vehicle, for reasons unknown, skidded off the roadway and onto the sidewalk, tore through an iron railing and plunged fifty feet before landing atop a wooden fence. A police officer was standing nearby, and witnessed the crash, running immediately to the scene. The viaduct was located beside the \\"Central Casino\\", which was that night hosting a dance. Hearing the accident, several people rushed outside. It took them fifteen minutes to pull Hite from underneath the motor of the vehicle. Hite was transported to Harlem Hospital, where he regained consciousness, and requested that his wife be notified. He had suffered a fractured skull, a compound fracture to his jaw, and three broken ribs. He died that same night. He was originally buried in Beechwoods Cemetery in New Rochelle, however at the request of his widow his remains were moved to Oakwood Cemetery in Chicago, Illinois, less than a year after his death.

It is the developer of the LH-10 Ellipse.  Introduction  Created in 2004 by Sebastien Lefebvre, this SME has managed in less than 10 years to establish itself as a French aircraft manufacturer in its own right and position in the area of aerial surveillance at the international level. Its flagship product, the LH-10, a two-seater plane full of carbon adaptable to multiple missions is considered the most advanced of its category. An innovative, economic and ecological response to the needs of the world market of light aviation. Versatile, it comes in different versions ranging from training aircraft, tactical UAV (24h autonomy), through the Advanced Surveillance monitoring or the intervention aircraft equipped with missiles and laser guided bombs guided for instance. Since this year, LH Aviation also features an operational range of UAVs from the contra rotating helicopter to the LH-D tactical UAV.  Finance and Strategy  At the 2009 Paris Le Bourget Air show, LH-Aviation was looking for financial support. Christophe Rémy who was financial and administrative manager of GECI- International came into contact with LH-Aviation. He offered a deal of €5M in order to manage their financial strategy. For that purpose \\"Magellan Industries\\" was created with Stéphane Schiller and Miss Châo Hoang Naudin (formerly manager of Reims-Aviation, bought by GECI-International before bankruptcy in 2010). Many financial instruments called Pégase 1, 2, 3 etc. were created and controlled by the Magellan society. Christophe Rémy, manager of Magellan Industries and major stock holder since 2010, became CEO of LH- Aviation in July 2017.https://www.lalettrea.fr/entreprises_defense-et- aeronautique/2017/06/15/christophe-remy-prend-le-manche-de-lh- aviation,108249883-brl The LH 10 did not succeed the certification procedure due to miss-conception problems.https://www.infomediaire.net/lh-aviation- mohcine-karim-bennani-gagne-une-longue-bataille-judiciaire/ That is why an UAV model was built. In 2014 LH Aviation contacted Mohsine Bennani-Karim, a Moroccan business man, in order to build the LH 10 M in Morocco. But disagreements came rapidly. According to Bertrand Vilmer expert, LH 10 did not have any airworthiness certificate, nor any kit airworthiness certificate and so could not have been sold.https://www.infomediaire.net/lh-aviation-mohcine- karim-bennani-gagne-une-longue-bataille-judiciaire/ In 2015, LH Aviation tried to settle in India also via licences agreements which do not need financial account from LH Aviation, but from the contractor.https://www.usinenouvelle.com/article/lh-aviation-veut-produire- ses-drones-bas-couts-dans-le-monde-entier.N340873  Key dates  * May 2004: LH Aviation created * September 2007: First flight of the prototype SN Presentation at the Avia International Airsh * Mars 2008: LH Aviation joined the Aerospace Cluster Activity at Melun-Villaroche * June 2010: Financial and operational backing from Aeronautic Investment Fund Magellan Ind. * June 2009: 2011, 2013: Participation to the 49th, 50th and 51st Paris Air Show and Flying demonstration * October 2011: First formation: Saget Promotion Official delivery of the first two surveillance airplanes * August 2012: First flight of the LH-10 Ellipse Surveillance Advanced version * May 2013: First rocket launch performed from the LH-10 Ellipse * April 2014: Set up of the Moroccan subsidiary * December 2014: Use of the LH-10 by the French border police * January 2015: Creation of the Explorair 45 * February 2015: Creation of the outsourcing department * 18 April 2018: judicial reorganization http://confidentielafrique.com/aeronautique/enquete-exclusive-dessous-de- turbulences-chez-lh-aviation%e2%80%af-france/ * 21 October 2018: judicial liquidation https://www.procedurecollective.fr/fr/redressement- judiciaire/1406512/lh-aviation.aspx  Products  LH-10 Ellipse at Le Bourget - 2009 = LH-10 Ellipse = The LH-10 Ellipse is ideal for training and pilot training; It has a tandem configuration and a glass cockpit adjustable front and rear. Thus, the drivers quickly become operational and versatile, that can provide a variety of missions. The LH-10 Ellipse enhances the educational work (low failure rate, evaluation of the potential of the student, using the aircraft extended range ...), it allows to master the that's wrong baby training costs and direct training (low cost of flight hour ...) and indirect (simple logistic monitoring, simple maintenance ...). It is also ideal for learning the combat of basic figures (barrel roll, upset, lazy eight ...) = LH-10 Guardian = The LH-10 Guardian is ideal for various surveillance missions (border, maritime areas ...) thanks to the concept of scalable technology platform multi-mission LH-10. During these missions, pilots can quickly intervene in land and sea areas, and transmit real-time information collected to command centers by secure links. The LH-10 Guardian has characteristics adapted (6h autonomy, autopilot 2-axis ...) and the \\"Plug & Play\\" equipment (gyro-stabilized ball, hyper-spectral camera, GSM encrypted ...) adapted to different types of surveillance. = LH-10 Elfe = The LH-10 is the military ACAS aircraft LH Aviation, it is nicknamed \\"Elfe\\" in reference to the legendary creatures of small size, light and dexterous with a great power. The LH-10 Elf is thus the intervention of LH Aviation platform. Possessing all integrated weapon system, it has a capacity of nocturnal lightning stop moving targets. With its unique system of KC20 / Mission shelter equipped, it can be projected quickly on any theater of operations. = LH-D = This is the tactical UAV with OPV option. 100% carbon design, it benefits from all the expertise and technical innovations developed and tested on the LH-10. Thus, it is equipped with the latest generation of embedded systems. It also has a quick release system, which gives it the ability to be packaged in a standard KC20 kind specially designed container. The LH-D is able to operate a surveillance mission in discreetly. Moreover, it can be implemented in degraded conditions and operated by a team of only three people. Its fields of application are multiple (surveillance zone, maritime surveillance, special forces task ...), its characteristics are adapted (autonomy 24h, low heat signature ...) and has very good communications (satellite link, Data link compatible with SAIM) and the \\"plug & play\\" equipment.

Greeks also colonized Cyrenaica around the same time. There was also an attempt in 513 BC to establish a Greek colony between Cyrene and Carthage, which resulted in the combined local and Carthaginian expulsion two years later of the Greek colonists. Alexander the Great (356–323 BC) founded Alexandria during his conquest of Egypt. This became one of the major cities of Hellenistic and Roman times, a trading and cultural centre as well as a military headquarters and communications hub. Phoenicians established a number of colonies along the coast of North Africa. Some of these were founded relatively early. Utica, for example, was founded c. 1100 BC. Carthage, which means New City, has a traditional foundation date of 814 BC. It was established in what is now Tunisia and became a major power in the Mediterranean by the 4th century BC. The Carthaginians themselves sent out expeditions to explore and establish colonies along Africa's Atlantic coast. A surviving account of such is that of Hanno, which Harden who quotes it places at c. 425 BC. Carthage encountered and struggled with the Romans. After the third and final war between them, the Third Punic War (150–146 BC), Rome completely destroyed Carthage. Scullard mentions plans by such as Gaius Gracchus in the late 2nd century BC, Julius Caesar and Augustus in the mid- and late 1st century BC to establish a new Roman colony near the same site. This was established and under Augustus served as the capital city of African continent Roman province of Africa. Gothic Vandals briefly established a kingdom there in the 5th century, which shortly thereafter fell to the Romans again, this time the Byzantines. The whole of Roman/Byzantine North Africa eventually fell to the Arabs in the 7th century. Arabs introduced the Arabic language and Islam in the early Medieval period, while the Malay people introduced varieties of their language to Madagascar even earlier. Comparison of Africa in the years 1880 and 1913 However the oldest European founded city on the African continent is Cape Town, which was founded by the Dutch East India Company in 1652, as a halfway stop for passing European ships sailing to the east.  Early modern period  Early European expeditions by the Portuguese concentrated on colonising previously uninhabited islands such as the Cape Verde Islands and São Tomé Island, or establishing coastal forts as a base for trade. thumb300pxAreas controlled by European colonial powers on the African continent in 1913, shown along with current national boundaries thumb300pxAreas of Africa controlled by European colonial powers in 1939  Scramble for Africa  Established empires, notably Britain, France and Portugal had already claimed coastal areas but had not penetrated deeply inland. Europeans controlled one 10th of Africa, primarily along the Mediterranean and in the far South. A significant early proponent of colonising inland was King Leopold of Belgium, who oppressed the Congo as his own private domain until 1908. The 1885 Berlin Conference, initiated by Otto von Bismarck to establish international guidelines and avoiding violent disputes among European Powers, formalised the \\"New Imperialism\\". This allowed the imperialists to move inland, with relatively few disputes among themselves. The only serious threat of inter- Imperial violence came in the Fashoda Incident of 1898 between Britain and France; It was settled without significant military violence between the colonisinig countries. Between 1870 and 1914 Europe acquired almost —one-fifth of the land area of the globe—to its overseas colonial possessions. Imperialism generated self-esteem across Europe. The Allies of World War I and World War II made extensive use of African labour and soldiers during the wars. In terms of administrative styles. \\"The French, the Portuguese, the Germans and the Belgians exercised a highly centralised type of administration called 'direct rule.'\\" The British by contrast sought to rule by identifying local power holders and encouraging or forcing these to administer for the British Empire. This was indirect rule. France ruled from Paris, appointing chiefs individually without considering traditional criteria, but rather a loyalty to France. France established two large colonial federations in Africa, French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa. France appointed the state officials, passed laws and had to approve any measures passed by colonial assemblies. Local groups in German East Africa resisted German enforced labour and taxation. In the Abushri Revolt, the Germans were almost driven out of the area in 1888. A decade later the colony seemed conquered, though, \\"It had been a long-drawn-out struggle and inland administration centres were in reality little more than a series of small military fortresses.\\" In 1905, the Germans were astonished by the widely supported Maji Maji Rebellion. This resistance was at first successful. However, within a year, the insurgency was suppressed by reinforcing troops armed with machine guns. German attempts to seize control in Southwest Africa also produced ardent resistance, which was very forcefully repressed leading to the Herero and Namaqua Genocide. King Leopold II of Belgium called his vast private colony the Congo Free State. His barbaric treatment of the Africans sparked a strong international protest and the European powers forced him to relinquish control to the Belgian Parliament to take control. Khapoya notes the significant attention colonial powers paid to the economics of colonisation. This included: acquisition of land, often enforced labour, the introduction of cash crops, sometimes even to the neglect of food crops, changing inter- African trading patterns of pre-colonial times, the introduction of labourers from India, etc. and the continuation of Africa as a source of raw materials for European industry. Colonial powers later focused on abolishing slavery, developing infrastructure, and improving health and education.  Decolonisation  Vincent Khapoya notes the significant resistance of powers faced to their domination in Africa. Technical superiority enabled conquest and control. Pro-independence Africans recognised the value of European education in dealing with Europeans in Africa. Some Africans established their own churches. Africans also noticed the unequal evidence of gratitude they received for their efforts to support Imperialist countries during the world wars. Vincent Khapoya also notes that while European imposed borders did not correspond to traditional territories, such new territories provided entities to focus efforts by movements for increased political voice up to independence. Among local groups so concerned were professionals such as lawyers and doctors, the petite bourgeoisie (clerks, teachers, small merchants), urban workers, cash crop farmers, peasant farmers, etc. Trade unions and other initially non-political associations evolved into political movements. Khapoya describes the differences in gaining independence by British and French colonies. Britain sought to follow a process of gradual transfer of power. The French policy of assimilation faced some resentment, especially in North Africa. Shillington describes the granting of independence in March 1956 to Morocco and Tunisia to allow concentration on Algeria where there was a long (1954–62) and bloody armed struggle to achieve independence. Khapoya writes that when President de Gaulle in 1958 held a referendum in its African colonies on the issue, only Guinea voted for outright independence. Nevertheless, in 1959 France amended the constitution to allow other colonies this option. As Shillington describes farmers in British East Africa were upset by attempts to take their land and to impose agricultural methods against their wishes and experience. In Tanganyika, Julius Nyerere exerted influence not only among Africans, united by the common Swahili language, but also on some white leaders whose disproportionate voice under a racially weighted constitution was significant. He became the leader of an independent Tanganyika in 1961. In Kenya, whites had evicted African tenant farmers in the 1930s; since the '40s there has been conflict, which intensified in 1952. By 1955, Britain had suppressed the revolt, and by 1960 Britain accepted the principle of African majority rule. Kenya became independent three years later. Shillington vividly portrays Belgium's initial opposition to independence, the demands by some urban Africans, the 1957 & 1958 local elections meant to calm this dissatisfaction, the general unrest that swept the colony, the rapid granting of independence and the civil strife that ensued. The main period of decolonisation in Africa began after World War II. Growing independence movements, indigenous political parties and trade unions coupled with pressure from within the imperialist powers and from the United States and the Soviet Union ensured the decolonisation of the majority of the continent by 1980. While some areas, in particular, South Africa, & Namibia retain a large population of European descent, only the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla and the islands of Réunion and Mayotte, the Canary Islands, and Madeira remain under European control, the latter two of which were never part of any African polity and have an overwhelmingly European population.  Theoretical frameworks  The theory of colonialism addresses the problems and consequences of the colonisation of a country, and there has been much research conducted exploring these concepts. = Walter Rodney = Guyanese activist, Walter Rodney describes in How Europe Underdeveloped Africa the extent to which Africa was pillaged and plundered by the West through economic exploitation. He opines that as Europe was being developed, Africa was being underdeveloped through the resources taken. His conclusion is that the structure of present-day Africa and Europe can through a comparative analysis be traced to the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade and colonialism. He includes a gendered analysis and states the rights of African women were further diminished during colonialism. = Mahmood Mamdani = Mahmood Mamdani Mahmood Mamdani wrote his book Citizen and Subject in 1996. The main point of his argument is that the colonial state in Africa took the form of a bifurcated state, \\"two forms of power under a single hegemonic authority\\". The colonial state in Africa was divided into two. One state for the colonial European population and one state for the indigenous population. The colonial power was mainly in urban towns and cities and were served by elected governments. The indigenous power was found in rural villages and were ruled by tribal authority, which seemed to be more in keeping with their history and tradition. Mamdani mentions that in urban areas, native institutions were not recognised. The natives, who were portrayed as uncivilised by the Europeans, were excluded from the rights of citizenship. The division of the colonial state created a racial segregation between the European 'citizen' and African 'subject', and a division between institutions of government. = Achille Mbembe = Achille Mbembe Achille Mbembe is a Cameroonian historian, political theorist, and philosopher who has written and theorized extensively on life in the colony and postcolony. His 2000 book, On the Postcolony, critically examines postcolonial life in Africa and is a prolific work within the field of postcolonialism. It is through this examination of the postcolony that Mbembe reveals the modes through which power was exerted in colonial Africa. He reminds the reader that colonial powers demanded use of African bodies in particularly violent ways for the purpose of labor as well as the shaping of subservient colonised identities. Through a comparison of power in the colony and postcolony, Mbembe demonstrates that violence in the colony was exerted on African bodies largely for the purpose of labor and submission. European colonial powers sought natural resources in African colonies and needed the requisite labor force to extract them and simultaneously build the colonial city around these industries. Because Europeans viewed native bodies as degenerate and in need of taming, violence was necessary to create a submissive laborer. Colonisers viewed this violence as necessary and good because it shaped the African into a productive worker. They had the simultaneous goals of utilizing the raw labor and shaping the identity and character of the African. By beating into the African a docile nature, colonisers ultimately shaped and enforced the way Africans could move through colonial spaces. The African’s day-to-day life then became a show of submission done through exercises like public works projects and military conscription. Mbembe contrasts colonial violence with that of the postcolony. Mbembe demonstrates that violence in the postcolony is cruder and more generally for the purpose of demonstrating raw power. Expressions of excess and exaggeration characterize this violence. Mbembe's theorization of violence in the colony illuminates the unequal relationship between the coloniser and colonised and reminds us of the violence inflicted on African bodies throughout the process of colonisation. It cannot be understood nor should be taught without the context of this violence. = Stephanie Terreni Brown = Stephanie Terreni Brown is an academic in the field of colonialism. In her 2014 paper she examines how sanitation and dirt is used in colonial narratives through the example of Kampala in Uganda. Writing also about Abjection through sanitation planning in the city and how this plays a key role in this narrative of colonisation. Brown describes Abjection as the process whereby one group others or dehumanizes another. Those who are deemed Abject are often avoided by others, and seen as inferior. Abjectivication is continually used as a mechanism to dominate a group of people, and control them. In the case of colonialism, she argues that it is used by the west to dominate over and control the indigenous population of Africa. Abjectivication through discourses of dirt and sanitation are used to draw distinctions between the Western governing figures and the local population. Dirt being seen as something out of place, whilst cleanliness being attributed to the “in group”, the colonisers, and dirt being paralleled with the indigenous people. The reactions of disgust and displeasure to dirt and uncleanliness are often linked social norms and the wider cultural context, shaping the way in which Africa is still thought of today. Brown discusses how the colonial authorities were only concerned with constructing a working sewage system to cater for the colonials themselves, and weren’t concerned with the Ugandan population. This rhetoric of sanitation is important because it is seen as a key part of modernity and being civilised, which the African population are therefore seen as not being. This lack of sanitation and proper sewage systems add to this discourse of the people of Africa and Africa itself being savages and uncivilised, playing a central role in how the west justified the case of the civilising process. Brown refers to this process of abjectification using discourses of dirt as a physical and material legacy of colonialism that is still very much present in Kampala and other African cities today. = Critique = Critical theory on the colonisation of Africa is largely unified in a condemnation of imperial activities. Postcolonial theory has been derived from this anti-colonial/anti-imperial concept and writers such as Mbembe, Mamdani and Brown, and many more, have used it as a narrative for their work on the colonisation of Africa. Postcolonial geographers are consistent with the notion that colonialism, although maybe not in such clear-cut forms, is still concurrent today. Both Mbembe, Mamdani and Brown’s theories have a consistent theme of the indigenous Africans having been treated as uncivilised, second class citizens and that in many former colonial cities this has continued into the present day with a switch from race to wealth divide. Mbembe is one of the most prominent writers within the field and this has led to his work being reviewed by numerous academics. On the Postcolony has faced criticism from academics such as Meredith Terreta for focusing too much on specific African nations such as Cameroon. Echoes of this criticism can also be found when looking at the work of Mamdani with his theories questioned for generalising across an Africa that, in reality, was colonised in very different ways, by fundamentally different European imperial ideologies. In contrast to Mbembe and Mamdani, Brown is a less prominent writer and one whose work is yet to be reviewed by other academics meaning it is currently harder to grasp what academic theoretical critiques could be brought against her work.

It is a low-wing single-engine pusher configuration with a tandem seating arrangement, and is constructed of composite materials.Bayerl, Robby; Martin Berkemeier; et al: World Directory of Leisure Aviation 2011-12, page 63. WDLA UK, Lancaster UK, 2011. ISSN 1368-485X The plane is marketed in a surveillance configuration as the Grand Duc (Eurasian eagle-owl).  Design and development  The LH-10 Ellipse was conceived by Frenchman Sébastien Lefebvre, starting as an engineering grande école (university) project to conceive \\"a small plane with different design and performance than available for private pilots\\". This led to the founding of the company, LH Aviation, in May 2004. As a surveillance plane, Sébastien Lefebvre conceives of the plane as an alternative to drone UAVs, the latter being costly to operate, especially near airports. The Ellipse aims to \\"deliver 80% of the range of drone missions for 20% of the cost\\". The potential of the plane for surveillance and military missions led the investment fund Magellan Industries to become a shareholder in LH Aviation. The Ellipse was thus further developed in collaboration with Thales as a modular platform for civilian and military missions with different equipment systems, including day and night vision, rocket launching, and on-board communication systems. Side view of the LH-10 Ellipse exhibited at the 2008 Farnborough Air Show The LH-10 Ellipse is a low-wing, tandem two-seat light kit aircraft, powered by a 100 hp Rotax petrol engine in a pusher-propeller configuration. Its low weight and unusual configuration is designed to deliver a very high cruising speed with exceptional fuel economy. This high speed and a relatively high 50-knot stall speed will exclude it from the UK Microlight or United States LSA categories, so a full single-engine private pilot certificate will be the minimum certification requirement to fly it in these countries, which are not the immediate target of the manufacturer, anyway. At the 2008 Farnborough Airshow LH-Aviation said that for the future they would be looking into LSA/ELA compliant production, possibly for the United States. The airframe is constructed of composite material based on ingredients produced by DSM. The production model is powered by a Rotax 912 four-cylinder reciprocating engine. (It has been tested using the 100 hp ULS variant, other options having been tested and discarded.) The undercarriage is a tricycle design, and will be available in fixed or electrically retractable front wheel configuration. The plane's design, with propeller in the tail and a short- nosed fuselage with a forward pilot seat in glider configuration, offers a field of view of 300 degrees. The design follows the Bede BD-5 configuration, but is longer, more streamlined and of lighter composite material. In February 2010, the aircraft began a series of tests required to achieve the French CNSK standard (an acronym for Certificat de Navigabilité Spécial Kit, the French kitplane certification). The company reported that \\"all construction documents have been validated in December 2009 by the French and English authorities.\\"Air et Cosmos n°2206 - February 19, 2010 - pp.14 Operational history The Benin Armed Forces ordered two Grand Ducs to monitor their coastlines around the capital Porto-Novo. The Grand Duc is a so-called \\"aerial territory surveillance system\\" and differs from the original version only in its more extensive on-board instrumentation, including an autopilot, equipment for night flying, GPS, Iridium satellite communications, transponder, digital camera and a Geobox system for tracking the aircraft from the ground.Le Point report on Benin order The first production Grand Duc appeared at the June 2011 Paris Air Show, painted in the colours of the Benin Air Force.Air-Britain Aviation World September 2011, p.140 The first unit was delivered to Benin in late 2012 and the second unit was scheduled to be delivered in September 2013. By 2018, no aircraft were operational. At the 2013 Paris Air Show, the company announced that it had received an order for 10 planes from Dubai-based Jet Energy. The planes are to be used in monitoring pipelines, oil rigs, and in tracking the dhows that conduct contraband trade between Iran and the United Arab Emirates.

Galerie Rudolfinum. František Skála (born 1956 in Prague) is a Czech sculptor, painter, children's book illustrator, musician, and dancer. He was part of one of the earliest post-modern Czech art groups, known as Tvrdohlaví (The Stubborn Ones) formed in 1987. Life and career Skála studied woodcarving at Secondary Applied Arts School (SUPŠ) in Prague from 1971–1975 and in 1982 graduated from the University of Applied Arts (VŠUP) in Prague in film and television graphics. His initial career was as an illustrator of children's books, and he won a number of awards in this field. In 1995, he represented the Czech Republic with his illustrations at the Frankfurt International Book Fair. His comic series The Great Travels of Hair and Chin was intended to be made into an animated feature film, and Skála worked on the project for several years, though in the end the project was not completed. As well as illustration, he began to be known from the beginning of the 1980s as a sculptor and creator of objects and installations. He presented his works at both solo exhibitions and joint exhibitions with his colleagues from the art group Tvrdohlaví (The Stubborn Ones), active from 1987 to 1991, which was one of the earliest post- modern art groups in the Czech art scene, and of which Skála was a founder member. He is also a member of a number of other art collectives, including: Bude konec světa (BKS; The End of the World is Coming), he is Commander of the Order of the Green Ladybird (Řád zelené beroušky), and a member of the music groups Malý taneční orchestr Universal (the Universal small dance band), which performs popular music from the communist era of Czechoslovakia in a humorous fashion, and Finský barok (Finnish Baroque). He is a member of the Sklep theatre company, and the vocal trio Tros Sketos. In 1990, he received an honourable mention in the Jindřich Chalupecký Award, and the following year won the main award, founded and presented by Václav Havel. The prize awards a three-month residential fellowship at the Headlands Center for the Arts in San Francisco in the United States. From 1992, he worked on designs for the interiors of the performance areas of the Akropolis Palace in Prague. In 1993, he was chosen to represent the Czech Republic at the 45th Venice Biennale. He made the 850 km journey to Italy on foot and then displayed drawings from the journey, along with fragile objects made of items he had found on the way, in the Czech Pavilion. He has also been a guest artist at art universities in Australia and the USA. According to the Czech Republic's official website, his work demonstrated a \\"peculiar poeticism\\", and his work is distinctive for the wide range of materials, including found objects, that he utilises, as well as the ironic humour in his work.

Plot  Miguel, a young man with a horribly disfigured face, attempts to trick a girl into sex by putting a mask on and pretending to be her boyfriend. When she unmasks him, he brutally stabs the young woman with a pair of scissors. After the crimes, Miguel is institutionalized at a mental asylum for five years. When his sentence is finished, he is released into the care of his sister, Manuela. Along with their invalid aunt and countess Maria Gonzales, his incestuous sister Manuela operates a boarding school for young women called Europe's International Youth-Club Boarding School of Languages, on the Spanish resort of Costa Del Sol. When Miguel rides the train ride from the sanitarium, he spots long-haired brunette woman named Angela. Meanwhile, professor Alvaro arrives at the school to visit Manuela, in which Maria states that she is being plotting against and that Manuela only wants money. That night, Maria lies in bed before she is burned to death with a torch. Angela arrives at the school later than her friends, and stays in the room where the girl was killed by Miguel. While wiping the bathroom mirror, she sees Miguel reflected before running outside, where the man follows her. She is then cared by her friend Inga, and the two go to visit Laura, Eva, and the gardener Antonio. Miguel goes to see his sister, and he proclaims his love to Manuela; the two kiss and touch. Manuela stops him, reminding him of the incident years earlier and citing that nobody understands them. After a night at the disco, Antonio walks Angela home and reads in bed. While the killer sneaks inside the room, Eva appears at her window and asks to borrow a pullover. While Eva changes, the killer attacks and pierces a long knife into her back. The next day in the Spanish class that Alvaro teaches, the class is listening to tapes of Spanish dialect. On Angela's tape, the voice suddenly changes and threatens to cut her with a hacksaw. She screams when she sees Miguel at the window, but disappears when Alvaro returns and the tape resumes back to its lessons. After finding bloody clothing at Eva's place, Angela sees Antonio arguing with Manuela before a boulder rolls down a hill and nearly kills Angela. While Manuela notices one of her snakes is missing, Angela asks around for Eva, before seeing Antonio killing a snake with garden shears, and runs. While Antonio tries to stop her, Alvaro appears and tells her to stop bothering his students. Laura and her friends go to Angela's room, where Inga is inside feigning a sexual act. While she does not notice the dead Eva hanging in the closet, the girls see Inga through the window and laugh at her. Outside, Angela sees Inga drive back in a yellow car, similar to one Manuela drove. The masked killer takes Inga somewhere, as she has accompanied the person willingly, where she is tied with rope. The killer turns on a saw and pushes Inga towards it. After a young boy turns off the machine, the saw is turned back on and decapitates Inga, before the killer chases and splatters him with the car. Meanwhile, Angela packs in her room, where she sees Antonio at the front door and Miguel at the window, she panics and barricade herself in the room. She then lets Laura inside and offers to stay for the night, where she goes to the disco club to grabs some drinks. When Laura returns, the killer strangles her with thongs around her neck. Angela, after receiving a threatening phone call, finds the dead bodies of her friends and is attacked by the killer. While Miguel is knocked out during the struggle, the girls sees Alvaro driving off in his car. Angela runs to Manuela and tells her about the bodies. Manuela takes her to a room and gives her a drink to relax her. Manuela and Alvaro discuss the killings that he has done, and an awakened Miguel hears them talk of blaming the murders on him. Manuela also talks of how Miguel thinks she loves him, and mentions his disfigurement. She tells Alvaro that she has already been paid and tells him to kill Angela. Miguel goes to a room and, eventually believing that Angela is his sister, chokes the blonde until she shoves a spike into his neck. Angela runs downstairs and sees Alvaro and Manuela struggling, before screaming at the body of the countess Maria found inside a room. Alvaro runs into the room and holds a knife to Angela, but Manuela appears and murders Alvaro with a power saw; she puts the saw to Angela's throat and reminds her that she saved her life, where Angela nods and runs away. Manuela then goes to her room and talks to her dead brother, but Miguel sits up and strangles Manuela. The film ends with Miguel collapsing and holding onto his sister's hand, while Antonio embraces with Angela as the police arrive.  Cast Production Bloody Moon was a \\"work-for-hire\\" production for Jesús Franco. Franco has stated that Rayo Casablanca, who is credited as the screenwriter of the film was actually production manager Erich Tomek.  Release  Bloody Moon was released in West Germany on March 27, 1981. The film was made available on DVD for the first time in the United States by Severin Films in 2008. This version restores all of the gore scenes, including the infamous circular saw, beheading scene.  Reception  In a contemporary review, Tom Milne reviewed the film in the Monthly Film Bulletin. Milne described the film as \\"appallingly meretricious schlock which looks as if it has been slung together using discarded out-takes from a dozen different potboilers\\" and that the film has \\"no visible means of support from either plot or characterization, the action simply staggers from one lurid climax to next\\". Bloody Moon was received favourably by DVD Verdict. Tim Lucas described Bloody Moon as \\"not one of Franco's better movies\\" and stated that the film \\"compares well to the shoddiness of American examples of the same period such as Prom Night, Bloody Birthday and the Friday the 13th films.

Sporting career Born in Barcelona, Spain, Palomo began water skiing in 1959 and in 1964, he won the Spanish water skiing national championship for juveniles. He was also crowned the European Junior Championship, a title he won two more times. In 1968, Palomo represented Spain as a member of the Spanish bobsleigh team in the 1968 Winter Olympics held in Grenoble, France. Palomo won the 1969 water skiing slalom world championship at the age of 21. The following year, he broke both knees during a training incident. After recovering from his injuries, he went to Belgium where he bought a ČZ motorcycle and began to race in motocross competitions. In 1971, Palomo gave up water skiing to concentrate on motorcycle racing. He raced off-road on an Ossa enduro motorcycle until an injury made him decide to switch to road racing. In 1972, he met British motorcycle retailer and former racer, Gus Kuhn who agreed to sponsor him on a Norton motorcycle at events in the UK and Europe. Barry Sheene was also instrumental in helping Palomo prepare his privateer Yamaha for Grand Prix racing. Palomo scored his first podium in 1973 at the 350cc German Grand Prix where he finished in second place behind Teuvo Länsivuori. At the Nations Grand Prix at Monza that year, he was involved in the tragic accident that took the lives of Jarno Saarinen and Renzo Pasolini. Palomo was injured in June after crashing at the Yugoslavian Grand Prix which led to him missing the rest of the 1973 season and part of 1974. He then won the 1974 350cc Spanish Grand Prix held on his home track at the Montjuich Circuit. In 1975 he competed in the 250cc, 350cc and Formula 750 championships. His most successful year was in 1976, when he finished in sixth place in the 350cc world championship, and won the 1976 Formula 750 world championship riding a Yamaha. The confused results of the Venezuelan Formula 750 round caused the championship's final standings to be shrouded in controversy. Kawasaki's Gary Nixon appeared to have won the second leg of the Venezuelan race however, the race organizers credited Yamaha's Steve Baker with the victory. Palomo was crowned champion, winning three races on aggregate time despite not winning a single heat. If Nixon had been awarded the victory in the Venezuelan round, he would have won the world championship by one point. Nixon protested the Venezuelan results to the FIM, who threw out the results of the event, thus denying his appeal. Palomo's 1977 season got off to a promising start however, he suffered serious spinal cord injuries at a non-championship event at the Paul Ricard Circuit. He tried to return to competition too quickly and suffered yet another crash which again forced him to take time off to recuperate. He spent the 1978 season competing in the Spanish 750cc national championship before returning to the world championships in 1979 as well as partnering 250 World Champion Mario Lega in the FIM Endurance World Championship on a Ducati. At the 24 Hours of Montjuich race, Palomo suffered another serious accident. The accident shattered his leg and the operations led to further complications which kept him away from racing until 1981. In 1982 he entered several World Championship events in the 250cc and 500cc classes but, suffered yet another accident. Death Palomo had numerous complicated operations along with treatments to promote bone recovery. The powerful painkillers, combined with his diabetic condition, caused serious side effects with heart and liver failure, which led to his death in 1985 at the age of 36 in Girona, Spain.

It was directed by Ernest C. Warde, and starred Florence La Badie, Holmes Herbert, and J. H. Gilmour, and released by Thanhouser Film Corporation.The American Film Institute Catalog Feature Films: 1911-20 published by The American Film Institute, c.1988 The film follows closely to the storyline of the book, and was a success in film theaters. The original story, with its strong patriotic theme, was written during the American Civil War in order to increase public support for the Union cause. The film had a like function with regard to the First World War, which the United States had joined a few months prior to the film's release. The film was released on September 9, 1917, and was the last film role of Florence La Badie, who would die in October 1917 from injuries sustained in an automobile crash in August 1917, just days before the film's premiere.Progressive Silent Film List: The Man Without a Country at silentera.com Plot As described in a film magazine, Barbara Norton (La Badie) and her brother Tom (Marlo), orphaned children of a veteran who gave his life for his country, go to live with their uncle Phineas (Howard) and aunt (Hastings) in the city. It is just before the entrance of the United States into the European war and the uncle is a pacifist. He holds meetings at home where Barbara assists him. Barbara's brother is a loyal American and is greatly troubled by the uncle's expectations to count on him. Barbara meets John Alton (Herbert), who wins her promise to be his wife. They are very happy until war is declared and Barbara cannot bear the thought of her future husband not doing service for his country. His \\"Peace at Any Price\\" button is the last straw and she gives him a choice of either joining the \\"colors\\" or breaking the engagement. John declares that he is a true pacifist and Barbara, believing that a man who cannot support his country is that country's enemy, breaks the engagement publicly. Her fiance becomes very unpopular at his club because of his views and is taken to task by one of his father's friends. Having lost Barbara and his popularity makes him resent the constant references to the United States and his debt to his country, and he curses his native land. Barbara enlists as a Red Cross nurse and her brother as a soldier. Later, an old friend of John's family, Pop Milton (Dundan), gives him a copy of The Man Without a Country and asks him to read it and rise above his treasonous views. He does so, and as he reads the immortal story the patriotic spirit of Barbara comes to him in a vision of Columbia who tells him that in a previous life he was the Philip Nolan of the story. She takes him back to historic times and shows him a succession of scenes from the book. The man of today sees with horror the famous court martial in which he was sentenced to never hear of the United States again, the tragedy of the careful carrying out of the sentence, and the pitiful death of the man, made easier by the humanity of Captain Danforth (Gilmour), who gives him a brief history of the land he learns to bless before he dies. John's spirit returns from the allegorical journey and he responds to the new and vigorous manhood within and enlists at once, thereby winning Barbara, who was at home on sick leave from her nursing work in France.

It was a light riding horse that originated in Turkey. History After the establishment of Turkey as an independent nation, the Turks bred horses they called Karacabey at the Karacabey Stud. They were developed by crossing the a Turkish strain of Arabians bred specifically for racing with the native Anadolu breeds.Hendricks, Bonnie. International Encyclopedia of Horse Breeds, University of Oklahoma Press, 1996, p. 248. Bongianni, Maurizio. Simon & Schuster's Guide to Horses and Ponies. Simon & Schuster, Inc., 1988, pg. 67. High quality show jumpers began to be imported from France and Germany, and the Karacabey breed was forgotten in favor of the exotic breeds. Another reason for its decline was competition from motor vehicles; the government decided there was no longer a need for this horse. The Karacabey Stud ceased all breeding of the Karacabey horse in 1980, and approximately 3,000 horses were sold at auction to the public. In a short time, crossed with other Turkish breeds, the Karacabey virtually disappeared, and today there are no Karacabey horses in Turkey. Ironically, almost as soon as the breed had vanished, the sport horse came to the fore as never before throughout the world, and Turkish officials deeply regretted the loss of this fine breed. Karacabey Stud now breeds the Arabian, Haflinger, and half-bred Halfinger. Characteristics The Karacabey was a very sound breed with good conformation, showing Arabian influence but with more body mass. They usually stood at 15.1 to 16.1 hands high, and were bay, black, gray, roan, or chestnut. They had a well-proportioned head with a straight profile, set on a slightly arched neck. They had pronounced withers, a wide, deep chest, sloping shoulders, a straight back, and a rounded, muscular croup. Their legs were strong and solid, with good joints and bone structure and well formed, tough hooves. The breed was said to be the only Turkish breed that displayed uniformity of type and consistent transmission of breed characteristics. =Related Types= The Karacabey Stud also bred a larger horse called the Karacabey-Nonius, now also extinct. The Karacabey-Nonius was bred as a harness horse and show jumper and was produced by crossing the Karacabey to the Nonius breeds. This breed easily jumped over five feet and averaged between 15 and 16 hands. Breeding the Karacabey-Nonius horses ceased entirely in 1970. Uses Karacabeys were used as a riding and pack horse, and for light draft and farm work. At one time, Turkey sent a fine Karacabey horse to England as a gift to Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, and this horse became a champion polo horse. The Karacabey was also a notable jumper.

León Toral was born in Matehuala, San Luis Potosí, into a family of Catholic miners. He moved to Mexico City during the Mexican Revolution and witnessed General Obregón closing churches and arresting priests who were suspected of supporting ex-President Victoriano Huerta. In 1920, he joined the National League for the Defense of Religious Freedom, which opposed the governments of Obregón (1920–1924) and Plutarco Elías Calles, and he reportedly was also involved in the Cristero movement. During the Calles administration, oppression against the Catholic Church greatly expanded in 1926 under the Calles Law, which provided for the execution of priests and other individuals who violated provisions of the 1917 Constitution. Wearing clerical garb in public outside church buildings was punishable by a fine of 500 pesos, then approximately US$250. A priest who criticized the government could be imprisoned for five years with no right to trial by jury.Tuck, Jim THE CRISTERO REBELLION – PART 1 Mexico Connect 1996 Some states enacted even more oppressive measures. Chihuahua enacted a law permitting only a single priest to serve all of the state's Catholics. Mexico, Religion U.S. Library of Congress To help enforce the law, Calles seized church property; expelled all foreign priests; and closed the monasteries, convents, and religious schools.Warnock, John W. The Other Mexico: The North American Triangle Completed p. 27 (1995 Black Rose Books, Ltd); Obregón had been more lenient to Catholics during his time in office, but the Cristeros and almost everyone else believed that Calles was merely his puppet leader. In 1927, two of León Toral's friends, Humberto and Miguel Pro, were executed after they had falsely been accused of plotting to assassinate Obregón. Incited by a Catholic nun, Concepción Acevedo de la Llata, also known as 'Madre Conchita' or Mother Conchita, he decided to assassinate Obregón, whom he blamed for the government's severities against Catholics. On 17 July 1928, two weeks after Obregón had been re-elected as president, León Toral, a sketch artist, entered La Bombilla restaurant in San Ángel, where a fete honoring Obregón was under way. Disguised as a caricaturist, he drew caricatures of Obregón, the orchestra director, and Aarón Sáenz, and showed them to Obregón, who told him the caricatures were well done and suggested that he should continue. When Obregón turned to sit down, León Toral drew a gun and shot him five or six times in the back, killing him instantly. León Toral was arrested immediately and pleaded guilty, claiming that he killed Obregón to facilitate the establishment of the Kingdom of Christ. Mother Conchita was also arrested and received a 20-year prison sentence but was pardoned after serving 13 years; she eventually married Carlos Castro Balda, a bomber of the Mexican Chamber of Deputies. León Toral was sentenced to death and executed by firing squad in February 1929. His last words were ¡Viva Cristo Rey! (Long Live Christ the King!), the battle cry of the Cristeros.

The town is situated on a peninsula about south of Mawlamyine, the capital of Mon State. It is a popular destination for local pilgrims and some tourists. The town has a pagoda (Kyaikkami Yele Pagoda or Kyaik-kami Ye Le Paya) just constructed on the sea using the natural foundation of its ocean reefs, which is connected with the corridor to the beach and always attracts the people for the festival of donations over the sea tides during. History It was originally a settlement of the Mon people. During the time of the Ayutthaya Kingdom (an ancient kingdom in Thailand), the town was probably a vassal state of Ayutthaya and it was known in Thai as Chiang Kran (เชียงกราน) or Chiang Tran (เชียงตราน). Kaikkhami was under the possession of Burmese kings before the First Anglo-Burmese war. Modern Kyaikkhami was founded by the British during the annexation of Tenasserim and Arakan states after the First Anglo-Burmese War.Encyclopædia Britannica The town was a fishing village of the Mon but it used to be a certain headquarters for British commanding officers for their southern-Burma control. It was renamed Amherst after William Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst, then governor-general of India who successfully seized the town during the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824–1826). Kyaikkhami (Amherst) briefly became the capital of Amherst district and the seat of British government that governs Tenasserim coast for a short period. Later, the British moved its seat of government to Moulmein (now Mawlamyine). Because of this, many British officers and their Burmese wives and families lived in the area, with a large presence of Anglo-Burmese people, as time progressed. In the early 19th century, Ann Hasseltine Judson, one of the first female American foreign missionaries lived in Amherst and died here on 24 October 1826 from smallpox. She was credited for the very first translation of Protestant scriptures into Thai and introducing the Protestantism in Thailand. Not only was her husband the first person to compile a Burmese-English dictionary, Ann Hasseltine Judson was also regarded as the mother of missionary schools in Myanmar that became the root of modern education in Myanmar. Her grave is still visible in the town. Majority of people living in Kyaikkhami are Buddhist Mon people. A Thai community also still exists in the town. Though the town was once the principal town of Amherst district, now it is a resort town within the Thanbyuzayat township. It got a record rainfall of 75 mm (2.95\\") on 14 January 2012.

In order to attract tourists,Kyaikkami should has to improve its roads, built international standard hotels, and other facilities. =Rubber production= Kyaikkhami has experienced a rapid growth in production of natural rubber over the past decade. Rubber has been cultivated in Kyaikkhami since the early 1900s. =Fishing= Kyaikkhami is blessed with some of Myanmar 's most bountiful fishing grounds. In Kyaikkhami, there are several types of fisheries, including coastal or inshore fisheries, and offshore or deep-sea fisheries. A majority of these fish are harvested by commercial means, which includes the use of trawling nets, purse seins, drift net and gill net. A minority still use traditional techniques, such as hook- an-line, cast net, bag net, trammel gill net and traps. The export value of fish and fish products has grown in recent years such as dried prawn and dried fish, raw prawn fish, fish sauce and fish cracker. =Others= Farmers in Kyaikkhami raise rice production, livestock for both food and labour purposes.

He served as Chief of the General Staff from 1960 to 1963. Born in Bathurst, New South Wales, Pollard graduated from the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in 1924. A regular officer, he served as adjutant/quartermaster in several battalions of the Citizens Military Forces (CMF) during the 1920s and 1930s. In 1938, he was posted to England to undertake staff training, which was cut short by the outbreak of the Second World War. Pollard joined the Second Australian Imperial Force in 1940, and the following year saw action with the 7th Division in the Middle East, where he was mentioned in despatches. Promoted to colonel in 1942, he became senior staff officer of the 7th Division in New Guinea, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his actions. He spent much of the remainder of the war in staff and training positions in Australia. Pollard's early post-war roles involved recruit training, land/air warfare, administration, and planning. In 1953, he was promoted to brigadier and took command of the Australian Army Component of the British Commonwealth Forces Korea. He joined the Military Board as a major general in 1954, and was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire the following year. In 1957 he was promoted to lieutenant general and took charge of Eastern Command in Sydney; two years later he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath. Knighted in 1961, as Chief of the General Staff he presided over the Army's reorganisation as a pentropic structure, and worked towards making Duntroon a degree-granting institution. In 1962, he oversaw deployment of the first team of Australian military advisors to South Vietnam. After retiring from the military in 1963, Pollard became Honorary Colonel of the Royal Australian Regiment; he served as Australian Secretary to Queen Elizabeth II during the Royal Visit in 1970 and was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order the same year. He died at Wyrallah, New South Wales, in 1978. Early life Reginald George Pollard was born on 20 January 1903 in Bathurst, New South Wales, the third son of Albert Edgar Pollard, an English accountant, and his Australian wife Thalia Rebecca, née McLean. Schooled in Bathurst, Reg entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in 1921, and graduated with the Sword of Honour for \\"exemplary conduct and performance\\" in 1924. Pollard and fellow graduate Frederick Scherger, winner of the King's Medal and future air chief marshal, applied to transfer to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) under a scheme designed to augment the RAAF's officer corps, but only Scherger was accepted.Moore, Duntroon, p. 64 The previous year, Pollard and Scherger had inaugurated a Duntroon tradition when they found a horse's jawbone during a field exercise. Inspired by the Biblical tale in which Samson slays the Philistines with the jawbone of an ass, they declared their find a lucky charm and brought it back to the college as a mascot; it became known as \\"Enobesra\\" (reportedly because \\"jawbone seemed so commonplace, an arsebone sounded much more interesting and spelt backwards sounded both mysterious and respectable\\").Moore, Duntroon, pp. 69–70 Ranked lieutenant in the Permanent Military Force (PMF), Pollard was appointed adjutant/quartermaster of the 17th Battalion (Citizens Military Forces), headquartered at North Sydney, in July 1925.The Army List, p. 185 He married Daisy Ethel Potter, a typist, at St Andrew's Anglican Church, Strathfield, on 31 October; The Bathurst Times reported that Daisy cut the cake with her husband's Sword of Honour. Pollard departed for India on attachment to the British Army in September 1927, serving with the Royal Fusiliers and the York and Lancaster Regiment. He returned to Sydney in November the following year and was posted as adjutant/quartermaster to, successively, the 18th Battalion (CMF) and, in September 1932, the 44th Battalion (CMF). In December 1932, while serving with the 44th in Western Australia, he was promoted to captain. Pollard was camp commandant of the National Rifle Association of Western Australia from 1934 to 1936. He was transferred to Army Headquarters, Melbourne, in October 1936. His next posting, in July 1938, was as General Staff Officer Grade 3, Training and General Duties, at the 2nd District Base, Sydney.Dawnay; Headlam, The Army Quarterly, p. 161 In November 1938, Pollard travelled to England to attend Staff College, Camberley; he graduated in September 1939, the planned two-year course having been curtailed owing to the outbreak of the Second World War. Second World War alt=Head-and-shoulders portrait of moustachioed man in military uniform at desk Following the declaration of war, Pollard served as Assistant Military Liaison Officer at the Australian High Commission, London; during this posting he spent two weeks attached to the British Expeditionary Force in France. Promoted major, he joined the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in June 1940. The provisions of the Defence Act (1903) prohibited members of the PMF or the CMF fighting outside Australian territory except as volunteers in the AIF.Johnston, The Australian Army in World War II, p. 5 Pollard was appointed brigade major of the 25th Brigade, an Australian infantry formation raised in England mostly from logistics personnel to help combat a possible invasion by Nazi Germany. The brigade became part of the Australian 9th Division, and in January 1941 sailed for the Middle East; it was transferred to the 7th Division on arrival. In March 1941, Pollard was assigned to the 7th Division's headquarters staff in Libya under Lieutenant General John Lavarack.Long, To Benghazi, p. 303 On 24 April, during the campaign in Cyrenaica, Pollard led a raiding party on Giarabub, Libya, to remove Senussi civilians and destroy wells and ammunition. He took command of the 2/31st Battalion at the end of June 1941, during the Syrian campaign, after the battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Selwyn Porter, was wounded.Dexter, Greece, Crete and Syria, p. 464 A cease- fire on 12 July ended the campaign in Syria, and Pollard was mentioned in despatches for his service; the award was gazetted on 30 December 1941.Dexter, Greece, Crete and Syria, p. 513 Pollard was promoted to lieutenant colonel in August 1941, and was responsible for establishing the AIF Junior Staff School in Palestine. He was raised to temporary colonel in March 1942 and posted to the AIF Staff in Ceylon, where the 16th and 17th Brigades had been garrisoned while on their way back to Australia from the Middle East.McCarthy, South-West Pacific Area, pp. 118–119 Returning to Australia in August 1942, Pollard was appointed General Staff Officer Grade 1 of the 6th Division; he served on its headquarters in Papua from September until mid-November, when he became Major General George Vasey's senior staff officer at the 7th Division.McCarthy, South-West Pacific Area, p. 414 Pollard received the Distinguished Service Order for his actions in operations at Gona and Sanananda, during which he \\"displayed unlimited energy and ascertained vital information for use in future operations\\"; the award was promulgated on 21 December 1943. At the conclusion of the Papuan campaign in January 1943, Pollard was posted to Queensland with the 6th Division, which was undergoing training and reinforcement.Dexter, The New Guinea Offensives, p. 55 He was Chief Instructor of the Senior Staff School at Duntroon from December 1943 until February 1945, when he became Deputy Director of Military Operations at General Sir Thomas Blamey's Allied Land Forces Headquarters in Melbourne.Long, The Final Campaigns, p. 593 Post-war career=Rise to Chief of the General Staff= alt=Outdoor half-portrait of moustachioed man in summer military uniform with peaked cap Pollard held command of the Army's Recruit Training Centre at Greta, New South Wales, from February to May 1946. He spent the next two months attached to the headquarters staff of Northern Command. In August he was posted to England to undertake a course at the Royal Air Force's School of Air Support in Old Sarum, and following his return in February 1947 was allotted to instruct at the soon-to-be-opened RAAF School of Air Support at Laverton, Victoria. It was redesignated the School of Land/Air Warfare in March 1948 and relocated to RAAF Station Williamtown, New South Wales.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 308 Pollard was appointed Director of Personnel Administration at Army Headquarters in January 1949. One of his tasks was to prepare the ground for the reintroduction of compulsory national service; the new scheme was enacted in 1951 and remained in force until 1959. Pollard's lieutenant-colonelcy had been made substantive in September 1946 and his colonelcy in July 1949. He attended the Imperial Defence College, London, throughout 1951; he served as aide-de-camp to King George VI from April that year until August 1952, and in the same capacity for Queen Elizabeth II until April 1954. In January 1952, Pollard succeeded Colonel John Wilton as Director of Military Operations and Plans at Army Headquarters, and became Chairman of the Joint Planning Committee. That August he was one of the Australian delegates joining the Minister for External Affairs, Richard Casey, for the inaugural meeting of the ANZUS Council in Honolulu; the US and New Zealand delegations were led, respectively, by Secretary of State Dean Acheson and Minister for External Affairs Clifton Webb. Pollard also took part in planning for the atomic test at Montebello, Western Australia, in October 1952. Promoted to temporary brigadier in March 1953, Pollard acted as Australian military advisor to Prime Minister Robert Menzies at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in London that June. From July to November he served as commander of the Australian Army Component of the British Commonwealth Forces Korea; the role was responsible for managing the turnover of Australian troops in the theatre and the upkeep of their personal records.O'Neill, Combat Operations, p. 238 Pollard was later appointed Deputy Adjutant General at Army Headquarters, and his rank of brigadier became substantive in December 1953. In September 1954, Pollard was promoted to temporary major general and appointed Quartermaster General and Third Military Member of the Military Board. At fifty-two, he was the youngest member of the Board.Horner, Strategic Command, p. 200 His promotion to major general was made substantive in December 1954. Inspecting conditions for Australian troops deployed to Malaya in December 1955, Pollard was quoted as saying that there were \\"one or two\\" serious complaints but that he was \\"amazed how few there were, considering that the average soldier complains considerably all the time\\". In August 1957, he was promoted lieutenant general and succeeded Eric Woodward as General Officer Commanding Eastern Command, upon Woodward's appointment as Governor of New South Wales. Headquartered in Sydney, Eastern Command covered the state of New South Wales and was the superior headquarters for the 2nd Division (CMF).Palazzo, The Australian Army, pp. 224, 238 Pollard was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen's Birthday Honours promulgated on 9 June 1955, and a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the Birthday Honours promulgated on 13 June 1959. =Chief of the General Staff= On 1 July 1960, Pollard succeeded Lieutenant General Sir Ragnar Garrett as Chief of the General Staff (CGS), and was raised to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen's Birthday Honours promulgated on 2 June 1961.Horner Strategic Command, pp. 194–195 Although favoured by Garrett, Pollard's succession had not been a foregone conclusion. The Minister for the Army, John Cramer, attempted to appoint Major General Ivan Dougherty, a retired CMF officer, but the proposal was defeated in cabinet on the advice of the Minister for Defence, Athol Townley, who feared the antagonism it was likely to engender among the senior ranks of the Regular Army.Grey, The Australian Army, pp. 199–200 As CGS, Pollard oversaw a major restructure of the Army. Following the lead of the US military, in 1960 the Australian Army replaced its \\"triangular\\" divisional structure of three infantry battalions under brigade headquarters, with a \\"pentropic\\" organisation consisting of five larger battalions without a brigade layer between division and battalion headquarters.Grey, The Australian Army, pp. 204–207 The reorganisation had been sponsored by Garrett and agreed to by Townley in December 1959.McNeill, To Long Tan, p. 13 According to historian Chris Clark, Pollard was \\"personally ambivalent\\" about the change, which was intended to rationalise resources and strengthen the battalions for overseas deployments but also resulted in the disbandment of the citizens' brigades and many other militia units. The US in any case abandoned the pentropic system in June 1961, and the Australian Army ultimately returned to the triangular formation following a review commissioned by Pollard's successor as CGS, Lieutenant General Wilton, in October 1964.Grey, The Australian Army, pp. 209Dennis et al, Oxford Companion to Australian Military History, pp. 419–420 Another of Pollard's focus areas as CGS was the academic qualifications of Army officers. Concerned that Duntroon graduates would begin to fall behind their tertiary-educated peers in the community, he worked to make the college a degree-granting institution, though this did not come to fruition until 1968.Moore, Duntroon, pp. 269–275 In December 1961, Pollard told the Secretary of the Defence Committee that he considered the Army's strength inadequate to support the government's policy of \\"forward defence\\", which involved meeting Communist aggression in South East Asia, well away from the Australian mainland. The CMF, he contended, was not properly equipped to provide relief for regular forces deployed overseas, and conscription \\"would appear to be politically and economically out of the question\\".Horner, Strategic Command, pp. 198, 396 Nevertheless, the government reintroduced conscription in 1964.McNeill, To Long Tan, p. 25 As the threat of South Vietnam falling to a Communist takeover became more apparent, the Army began in 1962 to exercise specifically to combat counter-insurgency operations, a type of warfare Pollard characterised as \\"frustrating groping at an elusive enemy\\"; he added that \\"no purely military solution to a Communist insurgency situation is possible\\".McNeill, To Long Tan, p. 12 In May that year, the Federal government agreed to South Vietnam's request for military instructors; Pollard was responsible for laying down guidelines for the thirty advisors deployed in August as part of the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam, led by his friend Colonel Ted Serong.McNeill, To Long Tan, pp. 38–39Horner, Strategic Command, p. 215 Retirement Upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of sixty, Pollard left the military on 20 January 1963, having recommended Wilton as his successor. He became a grazier on a farm at Wesburn, Victoria. In July 1965, he was made Honorary Colonel (later Colonel Commandant) of the Royal Australian Regiment, in which capacity he visited Australian troops in South Vietnam. He served as Australian Secretary to Queen Elizabeth II for the Royal Visit in 1970, and was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in recognition of his services; the honour was promulgated on 29 May 1970, backdated to 3 May. In 1974, he moved to a new property, which he christened Duntroon, at Wyrallah, New South Wales. Pollard died suddenly at his Wyrallah home on 9 March 1978. He was survived by his wife and two sons, and cremated.

Baby Florence is left at a boarding school with a note and half a bracelet instructing that her father will come to take her back upon her eighteenth birthday.

The Duke of Manchester was cast in a scene aiding Florence in escaping from Countess Olga and her \\"band of conspirators\\". Filming and $10,000 prize Filmed in New Rochelle, New York, The Million Dollar Mystery was produced by Thanhouser Film Corporation and was that company's biggest success, largely due to the popularity of La Badie, who performed her own stunts. Publicity gimmicks, including a monetary prize to anyone who submitted the best idea for a conclusion to the serial, were used to boost the serial's success. The Million Dollar Mystery was the new serial project from the Chicago Tribune following the success of The Adventures of Kathlyn. The serial was released with the gimmick that the last chapter was unwritten. Twenty-two chapters were written based only on the title, while the serial was left purposefully unfinished with no final chapter. A prize of $10,000 was offered for the best suggestion (advertised as \\"$10,000 for 100 words\\"). Thousands of letters were received by Thanhouser in response to this promotion, and Ida Damon, a secretary in St. Louis, Missouri, won the prize. In a further publicity stunt, the character Florence Hargreaves was actually reported missing. Details of the plot were fed to newspapers and the police as if they were real events. Seven days passed before this story was exposed as fiction.

The historic Francis Wilson house was known as the \\"house of mystery\\" in the production. Lonergan insisted that Thanhouser Company president Charles J. Hite acquire the house for the production, but attempts to rent the house for the production failed after the plans to use the grounds for \\"balloonists, soldiers and the actors for several months\\". Hite would provide the $200,000 for its purchase and the house was quickly made ready for the production. In a tour of the house, a Motion Picture News writer declared \\"is furnished in keeping with the imposing exterior of the mansion. Priceless Persian rugs carpet the entrance hall. In the dining-room heavy carved furniture groan under the weight of the silver service and in every room on the three floors it is apparent that exceptionally good taste has been used in the selection of the works of art which eventually will be seen in the completed film, \\"The Million-Dollar Mystery.\\" *Other sets used by the Thanhouser company included libraries stocked with real books and a Tudor staircase removed from an English country home. Costume costs for the production were noted to be quite high, with Marguerite Snow's costume bills reaching over $2000, although she only acted in six of the 46 reels. Florence La Badie's costumes, at least according to studio press releases, cost $10,000. Publicity also claimed some of the costumes were designed by the couturier Lady Duff Gordon (Lucile) Gastonia Gazette, Sept. 22, 1914) A walking staff once worn at the Russian court was given to Snow by Colonel Sandor Radanivich, said staff was claimed to be over fifty years old and displays iridescence when held up to the light. *For the production of the underwater scene, Carl Gregory was reported to have sailed to the Bahamas. John Ernest Williamson used his father's invention to allow for the first underwater films to be shot. For the scene, Gregory was lowered into the ocean depths in a unique diving bell-like apparatus and shoots the film with lighting aid provided by the mothership. *Another scene was done with the permission of the White Star Line and it involved a steamer unloading and a watchman's shanty at the edge of a pier on the Hudson River. *One stunt performed in the serial’s first episode or “chapter” ended in near tragedy. During production a professional aeronaut assisted Albert Norton in the balloon escape from the roof of a building. Danson Michell of The Motion Picture News reported that \\"Norton narrowly escaped losing his life in this attempt.\\"  Publicity  Motion Picture News reported that the meeting to finalize the arrangements regarding the serialization of the story in the Chicago Tribune would take place on April 10, 1914 between Thanhouser Company president Charles J. Hite, Harold MacGrath the novelist and Joseph Medill Patterson of Chicago Tribune. More than 200 different papers, including the Chicago Tribune would begin serialization of the story on June 28. The famous detective William J. Burns would also become a part of the fervor surrounding The Million Dollar Mystery and published his insights into solving the mystery in The Movie Pictorial.  Release  The serial was publicly released through Syndicate Film Corporation, although company executives allowed some film exhibitors (theater owners) and friends to view the first two reels of The Million Dollar Mystery in advance. That early viewing, attended by about a 200 viewers, was authorized in part by F. P. Glenn of the Syndicate Film Company. The serial as a whole is now considered to be a lost. Sequel and remake *The serial was highly successful and the stockholders received a return of 700% on their investment, receiving $1.5M at the box office for a cost of $125,000 \\"or so.\\" *As a result, another serial already in production was changed to become a sequel to The Million Dollar Mystery. The serial Zudora was renamed The Twenty Million Dollar Mystery and changes were made to the plot halfway through its release. It was not, however, as successful as its predecessor. *In June 1918, The Million Dollar Mystery was re-edited to six reels and released as a feature film through Arrow Film Corporation. *The serial was condensed and remade in 1927 as a feature-length silent film starring James Kirkwood.

Past membership has included such well-known artists as Andy Warhol, Samuel Rosenberg (artist), John Kane, Mary Cassatt, Philip Pearlstein, Robert Qualters, and Rochelle Blumenfeld. Exhibitions The following is from the Associated Artists of Pittsburgh's First Annual Exhibition catalog from 1910: The Associate Artists of Pittsburgh organized March 4, 1910. Exhibitions will be held annually. The society is designed to foster a love for the fine arts and a true appreciation of what Pittsburgh artists are doing. It owes the success of its first exhibition to the enthusiastic and practical co-operation of men and women in Greater Pittsburgh who are engaged in the creation of works of art, and the public spirit of Mr. Harry Davis, who volunteered the use of the Grand Opera House building as a place where the public may view the collection and become better acquainted with the talents of Pittsburgh artists. The Second Annual Exhibition was held at the Carnegie Institute [now the Carnegie Museum of Art], with an Acknowledgment printed in the Second Annual Exhibition catalog as follows: The Associated Artists of Pittsburgh desires to acknowledge its indebtedness to the Trustees of the Carnegie institute and its Director, Mr. John W. Beatty, for their courtesy in extending the use of the Galleries for this Exhibition.

The former are mostly sea ports (except for ports such as Shanghai, Nanjing and Nantong along the Yangtze and Guangzhou in the Pearl river delta) opening up to the Yellow sea (Bo Hai), Taiwan straits, Pearl river and South China Sea while the latter comprise ports that lie along the major and minor rivers of China. Most of China's major cities are also ports or are facilitated by a port nearby. Major ports The major ports in China, listed North to South, consist of: 1\\\\. Dalian 2\\\\. Yingkou 3\\\\.

Sanya Port construction and cargoes China's coastal ports enable the transportation of coal, containers, imported iron ore, and grain; roll-on-roll-off operations between mainland and islands; and deep- water access to the sea. In port construction, China has especially strengthened the container transport system, concentrating on the construction of a group of deep-water container wharves at Dalian, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, Ningbo, Xiamen and Shenzhen, and thus laying the foundations for China's container hubs. A new deep-water port has opened in Yangshan southeast of Shanghai. The coal transportation system has been further strengthened with the construction of a number of coal transport wharves. In addition, wharves handling crude oil and iron ore imports have been reconstructed or expanded. At the end of 2004, China's coastal ports had over 2,500 berths of medium size or above, of which 650 were 10,000-ton-class berths; their handling capacity was 61.5 million standard containers for the year, ranking first in the world. Freight volumes handled by some large ports exceed 100 million tons a year; and the Shanghai, Shenzhen, Qingdao, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Ningbo and Dalian have been listed among the world's top 50 container ports.. 130 of China's 2,000 ports are open to foreign ships. The major ports, including river ports accessible by ocean-going ships, are Beihai, Dalian, Dandong, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Haikou, Hankou, Huangpu, Jiujiang, Lianyungang, Nanjing, Nantong, Ningbo, Qingdao, Qinhuangdao, Rizhao, Sanya, Shanghai, Shantou, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Weihai, Wenzhou, Xiamen, Yangzhou, Yantai, and Zhanjiang.

PonniahBio of Swami Pranavananda was a founding member of the Divine Life Society in Malaysia. Early life N. Ponniah was born on 28 August 1908 at Alavaddi, in Sri Lanka. His parents Nagamuthu and Kannagi were devout Hindus. He studied at Arunodaya College. His college Principal T. Sinnathamby was a great influence. He came into contact with Yogaswami, through the help and guidance of K. Satkunasingam - who was later known as Siva Sathar - who showed him the Yoga Marg.

Blessings of the sages Ponniah undertook his first pilgrimage to India in 1948, and had darshan and blessings of Bhagawan Ramana Maharshi, Sri Aurobindo, and Kavi Yogi Sudhananda Bharatiar. He received during his later pilgrimages the benedictions of Ramadas, Paramahamsa Nityananda, Gnanananda Giri and Ananda Mai Ma. Yogi Sudhananda Bharatiar adopted him as his godson and taught him yoga asanas and sadhanas. When Yogi Sudhananda Bharatiar started the Sudha Samajam at Kuala Lumpur Ponniah was his handyman. Guru About 1950 he started his association with the Divine Life Society. In 1952 a copy of the Divine Life from Sivananda Ashram, Rishikesh reached Ponniah and he wrote his first letter to Sivananda Saraswati on 1 October 1952. Finally in 1953, Ponniah was drawn to Rishikesh and had darshan of Sivananda. While he was in Rishikesh in 1959, Sivananda made him a Committee Member of Divine Life Society Headquarters at Rishikesh and conferred upon him the title of 'Gurubakthi Ratna', and 'Prachara Praveena'. Ponniah became the founder member of Divine Life Society, Kuala Lumpur. He was given conditional initiation into sannyas by Sivananda in this year and was named Pranavānanda Saraswati. Sivananda's letters and advice to Pranavananda have come out in the form of a book titled Elixir Divine. In 1964, when Pranavānanda was at Rishikesh, the President of Divine Life Society, Chidananda Maharaj, accepted him fully in the fold of sannyasins with viraja homam in front of Gurudev's Samadhi, and acclaimed him Pranavānanda Saraswati on the sacred Guru Purnima Day (24 July 1964). He founded the Sivananda Ashram on of land at the foot of the Holy Batu Caves (a miniature Rishikesh), and became its President. He practised brahmacharya (celibacy) and tapas. The ashram became a centre of pilgrimage in Malaysia. Today, Divine Life Society has 20 branches in Malaysia , twelve set up by mainly by Pranavānanda. World Tour In August 1969 Vishnudevananda Saraswati, Founder Director of the Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centre, Montreal, Canada invited Pranavānanda to the Yoga World Brotherhood.

It is driven by Christian values rather than by government or commercial aims. It was established in 1959 in the UK as the Far Eastern Broadcasting Associates (FEBA, later known as Feba Radio) associated with Far East Broadcasting Company (FEBC) operating in United States and Philippines and the Far East Broadcasting Associates of India (FEBAI).  History  Initially, Feba Radio (UK) was an idea initiated by Douglas Malton and John Wheatley who, together with other individuals in UK, were interested in supporting what FEBC-USA was doing. FEBC-USA had difficulty reaching audiences in North India and identified Seychelles as a promising location to build an international shortwave transmitting station for this purpose. =Seychelles= Seychelles was a British crown colony, and in 1968 Feba Radio (UK) was incorporated as a charity and a company with the primary aim of planning, building and operating a radio station there. It was unique in having the antennas built over a lagoon 1 km (1,000 yards) offshore. The station was in many ways modelled on FEBC-USA's station in Manila, providing for multi-lingual programme production close to the station. Most of Feba's activity was in Seychelles, as a foreign company, with a small support operation in UK. In 1970, Feba Radio (UK) began regular shortwave broadcasts from their station in Seychelles using temporary equipment. The next four years saw the development of studios, offices, housing, transmitters, and the offshore \\"reef\\" antenna system. The oil crisis during this period seriously increased electricity cost and heightened the need for good strategic planning. Thereafter milestones in developing the Feba Radio network were often linked to international conferences held roughly every two years. =Move to offshore antennas= In June 1976, there was an international conference in Seychelles at a time when the nation of Seychelles gained independence and the offshore antennas were approved for use after a two-year delay, so the temporary antennas were dismantled and transmitted power levels were increased to 100 kW. Feba Seychelles' schedule was expanding to cover Southwest Asia, the Middle East and Africa. An English news service was introduced with the intention of expanding that into other languages. The English used on Feba programmes is predicated on the idea that most of the audience are not native speakers, and it uses a vocabulary and pacing (\\"Feba English\\") similar to that used in Simple English. In April 1979, an international conference was held in the newly leased UK office in Addlestone. For various reasons several key staff were repatriated to UK and began to operate a \\"headquarters\\" office there. In November 1981, an international conference in Mussoree, India, resolved that Feba should increase its role in programme production, rather than simply broadcasting other organisations' programmes. This was to be done by staff in the listening areas, not by moving them to Seychelles, and provision was made for up to 50% of each programme service to be \\"in-house\\" production. In May 1984, there was another international conference in Seychelles. Feba was challenged to expand into a second large shortwave station in Sierra Leone but instead decided to focus on improving programming. There followed a decade of vigorous activity. =\\"World by 2000\\"= In June 1986, there was an international conference in Flevohof, Netherlands, during the International Christian Media Convention (ICMC). With other major Christian broadcasters, Feba entered into the ambitious \\"World by 2000\\" commitment to enable everyone to hear about Christianity on the radio in a language that they could understand. In September 1988 there was an international conference in Singapore, and in September, 1991, another international conference in Sheffield, UK, jointly with the FEBC-USA partners. In October 1994 in another international conference in Hove, UK, there was an attempt to move away from the idea of Feba UK being \\"headquarters\\" and to try to make each national operation as autonomous as possible despite the practicalities of centralising the schedule of broadcasting through the limited facilities (essentially the antenna coverage) of the one station in Seychelles and optimising its use cost-effectively. In January 1996 there was an international conference in Tagaytay, Philippines. =The end of the Cold War= In 1996 the Government of Seychelles gave Feba early warning that their East Coast land reclamation activity was likely to bring development which was incompatible with continuing operation of Feba's station within five years. As it happened the recent end of propaganda broadcasting associated with the Cold War and apartheid meant that surplus shortwave transmission capability was beginning to be marketed attractively in Feba's area. This stimulated Feba to consider two things: more of an emphasis on \\"people with something to say\\" rather than on the nuts and bolts of operating a radio station; and creation of an international Feba structure instead of one depending on Seychelles as a hub. In May 1998, another international conference was held in Worthing, UK. Around 1999 the tightening regulation of charities in the UK caused Feba to seriously change direction regarding international structure. This was essentially so that Feba Radio (UK) could demonstrate good accountability for the use of funds raised in the UK which were handed to Feba staff in other countries to spend. This second attempt at an international structure became very unwieldy. In February 2000, another international conference, held jointly with FEBC-USA was held in Larnaca, Cyprus. In February 2002, another conference was held in Johannesburg, South Africa. . =Closure of Seychelles station= In 2003 the large station in Seychelles was closed, although Feba Radio continues to use radio in many ways in the region. In January 2004, another joint conference with FEBC-USA was held in Bali, Indonesia. In January 2006, the international conference was held in Pretoria, South Africa. In January, 2008, another international conference was held in High Leigh, UK, joint with FEBC-USA's partners. Feba-UK began working with a third, compromise, international structure based on agreements with each partner which are tailored to the requirements of each partnership rather than one- size-fits-all.

It was re-released on the Virtual Console for North America on January 14, 2008,Nintendo press release in the PAL regions on January 18, 2008, and in Japan on April 1, 2008. Plot In the beginning, the setting takes place in New York City where two men known as Hawk Takezaki and Tony Aldus met up with their chief Jim Hyde, and told him that they finally forced a villain known as Bossman to stay in a place called the DragonZone. The chief advised Hawk not to enter the DragonZone and head back home, but Hawk refused to do so. Before he immediately began traveling toward DragonZone and try to demolish it, in order to save a girl name Candy, Tony told Hawk that he will join him. Gameplay Like Riot City, Riot Zone resembles Capcom's 1989 arcade hit, Final Fight, which is an archetypal side scrolling beat-em-up game. Players choose between two characters: Hawk, the blond-haired vigilante who has average statistics, and Tony, who is strong, but slow and has a break-dancing move. Player controls the chosen character from left to right through each level (most of which are split into three or more scenes), fighting with the enemy characters who appear, until they reach a confrontation with a stronger boss character at the end of the level. Once that boss is beaten, the player automatically moves on to the next stage. Enemies appear from both sides of the screen, and the player must defeat all of them to progress. If the player tries to simply travel through the levels without fighting, the screen will stop scrolling until all current enemies have been defeated, before allowing the player to continue progress. Enemies may move outside the confines of the screen, but players may not. Unlike Final Fight, there are no weapons to pick up along the way, but the player will only pick up items for points and health. Unlike Riot City, Riot Zone lacks multiplayer and instead of chiptune music, the TurboGrafx-CD allows it to play high-quality CD-DA music. Development Riot Zone is a port of the 1991 arcade game Riot City developed by Westone Bit Entertainment and distributed by Sega. When Hudson Soft picked up the rights to the game for a home conversion to the TurboGrafx-16, they changed the title and character designs in a matter similar to what they done with various ports of the Wonder Boy series to non-Sega consoles (such as the original Adventure Island on the NES or Dragon's Curse on the TurboGrafx-16). The development of the game was handled by Agenda Co. Ltd.

Girls Gone Wild was known for its early use of direct-response marketing techniques, including its late-night infomercials that began airing in 1997. The videos typically involve camera crews at party locations engaging young college-aged women who expose their bodies or act \\"wild\\", especially during Spring break. Since 2008, the Girls Gone Wild products have been sold primarily through their website as streaming videos, downloads, and DVDs. In February 2013, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In 2014, the company was sold to Bang Bros.  Background  The first Girls Gone Wild film was released in 1997. In 2001 the company sold 4.5 million videos and DVDs. By the end of 2002, the company had produced 83 different titles and had begun airing 30-minute infomercials on E! Entertainment Television, Fox Sports Net, BET, Comedy Central, Tech TV, Style, and all other major U.S. networks. The infomercials targeted a late-night channel-surfing demographic that Joe Francis had identified in the late 1990s. According to TNS Media Intelligence, Girls Gone Wild spent more than $21 million in advertising in 2003, becoming the largest advertiser for programs on the E! channel. In 2008, Francis' net worth was approximately $150 million. Instances of Girls Gone Wild in popular culture include the appearance of Eminem and Snoop Dogg in the company's videos, as well as various references and parodies of the show in popular television series and movies. MGM announced in 2002 that it would release a feature-length film based on the Girls Gone Wild concept. =Content= Most Girls Gone Wild videos follow a common formula in which a film crew interacts with a large crowd of people either at a party, club, or other event. Women willingly take off their clothes, engage in sexual activities, or participate in wet T-shirt contests. Compensation for taking part in a Girls Gone Wild video often consists of a free hat, T-shirt, or money. Occasionally, participants are invited to be filmed on a Girls Gone Wild tour bus. =Distribution channels= At its inception, Girls Gone Wild marketed its product, namely videos, through direct-distribution channels such as infomercials, pay-per-view, and video on demand. This distribution was followed in 2008 by the launch of a Girls Gone Wild magazine, a clothing line, and a compilation record released on Jive Records. Girls Gone Wild for Katrina In September 2005, Girls Gone Wild announced that it would donate all proceeds of Mardi Gras–themed DVDs and videos to the Red Cross. Proceeds from the video sales, which included a title featuring Snoop Dogg, were intended to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina. Guys Gone Wild In 2004, Girls Gone Wild began soliciting men for participation in their videos. Guys Gone Wild was a video series and male analogue of Girls Gone Wild targeted at young women. These video tapes and DVDs featured much the same content as the Girls equivalent, only instead showing young men performing for the camera—e.g., in the shower, playing football naked, etc. In an article, Bill Horn, spokesman for Mantra Entertainment which produced the videos, notes a gender-related double standard in these videos. In the Girls Gone Wild series, sometimes the young women kiss, while the guys' series does not have that feature. Horn explains: \\"Let's face it, there's a double standard when it comes to guy-on-guy as opposed to girl-on-girl. It's sexy to see two girls making out. It's not considered sexy to see two guys making out. That's just the reality, and, we were there to capture the reality.\\" The hour-long Guys Gone Wild productions featured women camera operators who encouraged men to get naked and perform strip teases. Legal In 2003, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a complaint against Girls Gone Wild alleging that the company failed to notify customers when they purchased subscriptions under a continuity program, rather than single DVDs. In 2004, GGW settled for $1.1 million and agreed to disclose all terms and get consent for recurring charges. In 2006, Girls Gone Wild marketer MRA Holdings pleaded guilty to charges for failing to record filmed subject's ages in 2002 and 2003. The parties agreed to pay $2.1 million in restitution and fines. In 2008, Ashley Dupré filed against Joe Francis and other defendants claiming that they filmed her without consent. Dupré dropped the suit after Francis released footage of her consent. In 2008, a Missouri woman claimed that she was filmed without consent when a Girls Gone Wild contractor removed her halter top at a St. Louis bar. A jury found that she consented. On re-trial, a judge awarded the woman $5.77 million after the defense failed to show at court. On appeal, the judge upheld the verdict.

Chaetoceros is probably the largest genus of marine planktonic diatoms with approximately 400 species described, although many of these descriptions are no longer valid. It is often very difficult to distinguish between different Chaetoceros species.C.H. von Quillfeldt., (2001). Identification of Some Easily Confused Common Diatom Species in Arctic Spring Blooms. Botanica Marina Vol. 44: 375–389 Several attempts have been made to restructure this large genus into subgenera and this work is still in progress.Tomas, C. R., Hasle G. R., Syvertsen, E.

Systematics of Chaetocerotaceae (Bacillariophyceae). I. A phylogenetic analysis of the family, Phycological research 51: 83-98. However, most of the effort to describe species has been focused in boreal areas, and the genus is cosmopolitan, so there are probably many tropical species still undescribed.J.E.B. Rines, P. Boonruang and E.C. Theriot., (2000). Chaetoceros phuketensis sp. nov. (Bacillariophyceae): a new species from the Andaman Sea. Phycological Research 48 (3): 161–168. Some species are known from the fossil record, from the Quaternary of Sweden. It is the type genus of its family. Description The genus Chaetoceros were first described by Ehrenberg in 1844. Cells are more or less rectangular in girdle view. Cells are usually elliptical in valve view. Opposite setae of adjacent cells touch near their origin. Chaetoceros is primarily a marine genus, but there are also accounts of species within inland waters of the United States. It is a type of centric diatom that contains a frustrule or cell wall composed of silica that contain long, thin spins (setae). The spines connect the frustules together creating a colony of cells.Spaulding, S., and Edlund, M. (2008). Chaetoceros. In Diatoms of the United States. Retrieved October 19, 2017, from http://westerndiatoms.colorado.edu/taxa/genus/Chaetoceros Cells colonies can form chains that are coiled, straight, or curved.

Chaetoceros. http://www.iobis.org/mapper/?taxon_id=611649. Accessed 18 Mar 2012. Beneficial Effects Due to its high growth rates and high lipid concentrations, research has been conducted to potentially use Chaetoceros as a biofuel. Studies suggest that colonies of Chaetoceros serve as an important food source within the water column and major carbon contributor to the benthic environment. Within the North Water, located in northern Baffin Bay, Chaetoceros has been reported to contribute about 91% of total phytoplankton cells serving as an important primary producer within this area. Therefore, contributing to oxygen production in the North Water. Overall, phytoplankton contributes to over half of Earth's oxygen production.https://www.nationalgeographic.org/activity/save-the-plankton- breathe-freely/  Blooms  Chaetoceros blooms have been reported to reach concentrations of 30,100 cells/ml and can persist for multiple months. Blooms are able to persist because individuals can survive at low nutrient levels. When present in large quantities, species with larger, thicker spines can damage organisms' gills.Kraberg, A., Baumann, M. and Durselen, C. D. 2010. Coastal Phytoplankton: Photo Guide for Northern European Seas. Verlag Dr. Friedrich Pfeil, Munchen, Germany. 204.

Apart from preferential allotment, this is the only other speedy method of private placement whereby a listed company can issue shares or convertible securities to a select group of persons. QIP scores over other methods because the issuing firm does not have to undergo elaborate procedural requirements to raise this capital. Why was it introduced? The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) introduced the QIP process through a circular issued on May 8, 2006,SEBI circular on QIP: http://www.sebi.gov.in/circulars/2006/dipcir0506.html to prevent listed companies in India from developing an excessive dependence on foreign capital. Prior to the innovation of the qualified institutional placement, there was concern from Indian market regulators and authorities that Indian companies were accessing international funding via issuing securities, such as American depository receipts (ADRs), in outside markets. The complications associated with raising capital in the domestic markets had led many companies to look at tapping the overseas markets. This was seen as an undesirable export of the domestic equity market, so the QIP guidelines were introduced to encourage Indian companies to raise funds domestically instead of tapping overseas markets.QIP – Investopedia definition Who can participate in the issue? The specified securities can be issued only to QIBs, who shall not be promoters or related to promoters of the issuer. The issue is managed by a Sebi-registered merchant banker.

The placement document is placed on the websites of the stock exchanges and the issuer, with appropriate disclaimer to the effect that the placement is meant only QIBs on private placement basis and is not an offer to the public. (QIBs) are those institutional investors who are generally perceived to possess expertise and the financial muscle to evaluate and invest in the capital markets. In terms of clause 2.2.2B (v) of DIP guidelines, a ‘qualified institutional buyer’ shall mean: g) foreign venture capital investors registered with SEBI. h) state industrial development corporations. i) insurance companies registered with the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA). j) provident funds with minimum corpus of Rs.25 crores k) pension funds with minimum corpus of Rs. 25 crores \\"These entities are not required to be registered with SEBI as QIBs. Any entities falling under the categories specified above are considered as QIBs for the purpose of participating in primary issuance process.\\" QIPs in India and the US In US US securities laws contain a number of exemptions from the requirement of registering securities with the US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC). Pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, issuers may target private placements of securities to QIBs. Although often referred to as Rule 144A offerings, as a technical matter, transactions must actually involve an initial sale from the issuer to the underwriter and then a resale from the underwriters to the QIBs. A QIB is defined under Rule 144A as having investment discretion of at least $100 million and includes institutions such as insurance agencies, investment companies, banks, etc. Rule 144A was adopted by the SEC in 1990 in order to make the US private placement market more attractive to foreign issuers who may not wish to make more onerous direct US listings. Whereas the US regulators by enacting Rule 144A sought to make the domestic US capital markets more attractive to foreign issuers, the Indian regulators are seeking to make the domestic Indian capital markets more attractive to domestic Indian issuers. In India Therefore, to encourage domestic securities placements (instead of foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) and global or American depository receipts (GDRs or ADRs)), the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has with effect from May 8, 2006 inserted Chapter XIIIA into the SEBI (Disclosure & Investor Protection) Guidelines, 2000 (the DIP Guidelines), to provide guidelines for Qualified Institutional Placements (the QIP Scheme). The QIP Scheme is open to investments made by “Qualified Institutional Buyers” (which includes public financial institutions, mutual funds, foreign institutional investors, venture capital funds and foreign venture capital funds registered with the SEBI) in any issue of equity shares/ fully convertible debentures/ partly convertible debentures or any securities other than warrants, which are convertible into or exchangeable with equity shares at a later date (Securities). Pursuant to the QIP Scheme, the Securities may be issued by the issuer at a price that shall be no lower than the higher of the average of the weekly high and low of the closing prices of the related shares quoted on the stock exchange (i) during the preceding six months; or (ii) the preceding two weeks. The issuing company may issue the Securities only on the basis of a placement document and a merchant banker needs to be appointed for such purpose. There are certain obligations which are to be undertaken by the merchant banker. The minimum number of QIP allottees shall not be less than two when the aggregate issue size is less than or equal to Rs 250 crore; and not less than five, where the issue size is greater than Rs 250 crore. However, no single allottee shall be allotted more than 50 per cent of the aggregate issue size. The aggregate of proposed placement under the QIP Scheme and all previous placements made in the same financial year by the company shall not exceed five times the net worth of the issuer as per the audited balance sheet of the previous financial year. The Securities allotted pursuant to the QIP Scheme shall not be sold by the allottees for a period of one year from the date of allotment, except on a recognized stock exchange. This provision allows the allottees an exit mechanism on the stock exchange without having to wait for a minimum period of one year, which would have been the lock–in period had they subscribed to such shares pursuant to a preferential allotment. The Difference There are some key differences between the SEC’s Rule 144A and the SEBI QIP Scheme such as the SEBI pricing guidelines and the US rule that a private placement under Rule 144 A must be a resale and not a direct issue by the issuer. In addition, the target audience of both regulations is different -while the impetus behind Rule 144A was to encourage non-US issuers to undertake US private placements, the impetus behind the SEBI QIP Scheme was to encourage domestic Indian issuers to undertake domestic Indian private placements. Nonetheless, the intention of both regulations is to encourage private placements in the domestic markets of the US and India, respectively Benefits of qualified institutional placements Time saving: QIPs can be raised within short span of time rather than in FPO, Right Issue takes long process. Rules and regulations: In a QIP there are fewer formalities with regard to rules and regulation, as compared to follow-on public issue (FPO) and rights Issue. A QIP would mean that a company would only have to pay incremental fees to the exchange. Additionally in the case of a GDR, you would have to convert your accounts to IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards). For a QIP, company’s audited results are more than enough Cost-efficient: The cost differential vis-à-vis an ADR/GDR or FCCB in terms of legal fees, is huge. Then there is the entire process of listing overseas, the fees involved. It is easier to be listed on the BSE/NSE vis-à-vis seeking a say Luxembourg or a Singapore listing. Lock-in: It provides an opportunity to buy non-locking shares and as such is an easy mechanism if corporate governance and other required parameters are in place.

Alogliptin does not decrease the risk of heart attack and stroke. Like other members of the gliptin class, it causes little or no weight gain, exhibits relatively little risk of hypoglycemia, and has relatively modest glucose-lowering activity. Alogliptin and other gliptins are commonly used in combination with metformin in people whose diabetes cannot adequately be controlled with metformin alone. In April 2016, the U.S. FDA added a warning about increased risk of heart failure. It was developed by Syrrx, a company which was acquired by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company in 2005. Medical uses Alogliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor that decreases blood sugar similar to the other. Side effects Adverse events include mild hypoglycemia based on clinical studies. Alogliptin is not associated with increased weight, increased risk of cardiovascular events. It may also cause joint pain that can be severe and disabling. In April 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a warning about increased risk of heart failure. Market access Alogliptin tablets sales in Mainland China. Specification is 25mg * 10 tablets. In December 2007, Takeda submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) for alogliptin to the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), after positive results from Phase III clinical trials. In September 2008, the company also filed for approval in Japan, winning approval in April 2010. The company also filed a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) elsewhere outside the United States, which was withdrawn in June 2009 needing more data. The first USFDA NDA failed to gain approval and was followed by a pair of NDAs (one for alogliptin and a second for a combination of alogliptin and pioglitazone) in July 2011. In 2012, Takeda received a negative response from the USFDA on both of these NDAs, citing a need for additional data. In 2013, the FDA approved the drug in three formulations: as a stand-alone with the brand-name Nesina, combined with metformin using the name Kazano, and when combined with pioglitazone as Oseni.

Martin Gray (born Mieczysław Grajewski; 27 April 1922 – 24 April 2016) was a man who claimed to be a Holocaust survivor who emigrated to the West, and published books in French about his purported experiences during World War II in which his family perished in Poland. Life Born in Warsaw, Second Polish Republic, the son of Henry/Henoch and Ida [Feld]; Grajewski (Gray) was 17 years old when Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland; they resided at 23 Mila Street Warsaw.For Those I loved His mother and brothers Isaac and Yacob died in Treblinka extermination camp ; his father was killed in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of 1943. He wrote later that he escaped from the Treblinka extermination camp during the most deadly phase of the Holocaust. He joined the Red Army during the Soviet counter- offensive and became an officer of the NKVD secret police in August 1944.Martin Gray photo as the NKVD agent decorated with an Order of the Red Star presented by NKVD (KGB since 1954). Menteurs et affabulateurs de la Shoah, d’Anne Kling , Enquete-debat.fr; accessed 5 May 2016. Grajewski (pseudonym \\"Zamojski\\") was tasked with breaking up Polish anti-communist underground in the area of Zambrów. By his own admission, Gray slept at the local NKVD headquarters with a pistol in his hand for security. Grajewski emigrated in 1946 from Europe to the United States, where his grandmother was living. A decade after his arrival Gray had become a tradesman in replicas of antiques according to what he wrote, doing business in the U.S., Canada and Cuba. He moved to the South of France in 1960.Martin Gray, Au nom de tous les miens, Paris, Laffont, 1971 ; rééd. Pocket, 1998, pp. 327-32. Gray moved to Belgium in 2001. On 24 April 2016, three days before his 94th birthday, he was found dead in his swimming pool at his home in Ciney, Belgium, where he had lived since 2012.Im Alter von 93 Jahren: Schriftsteller Martin Gray ist tot, wort.lu; accessed 1 August 2018. Writings Gray's first book, For Those I Loved (Au nom de tous les miens), became a bestseller. Another 11 books would follow over the years. All of Gray's books have been written in French. Several of them have been translated into English. Gray's last book Au nom de tous les hommes (2005) has not yet been translated into English. Two of Gray's books are autobiographies: the already mentioned For Those I Loved covers the era from his birth in 1922 to 1970, when Gray lost his wife and his four children in a forest fire. His second autobiography, La vie renaitra de la nuit, (Life Arises Out of Darkness) covers 1970-77, during which Gray found his second wife, Virginia. In this second autobiography he describes desperately looking for a way to live after the demise of his family in the 1970 fire. In 1979, U.S. photographer David Douglas Duncan produced a book of photographs and text about Gray: The Fragile Miracle of Martin Gray. Criticism Holocaust historian Gitta Sereny dismissed Gray's book as a forgery in a 1979 article in New Statesman magazine, writing that \\"Gray's For Those I Loved was the work of Max Gallo the ghostwriter: \\"During the research for a Sunday Times inquiry into Gray's work, M. Gallo informed me coolly that he 'needed' a long chapter on Treblinka because the book required something strong for pulling in readers. When I myself told Gray, the 'author', that he had manifestly never been to, nor escaped from Treblinka, he finally asked, despairingly, 'But does it matter? Wasn't the only thing that Treblinka did happen, that it should be written about, and that some Jews should be shown to have been heroic?'\\"Sereny, Gitta. \\"The Men Who Whitewash Hitler\\" New Statesman, Vol. 98, No. 2537, 2 November 1979, pp. 670-73. Pierre Vidal- Naquet, a French historian who first followed the idea of Gitta Sereny, has been persuaded by certificates provided by Martin Gray and withdrew his accusations against him. Nevertheless, he continued to blame Max Gallo for taking liberties with the truth. The Polish daily newspaper Nowiny Rzeszowskie (Rzeszów News) on 2 August 1990 published an interview with World War II Captain Wacław Kopisto, a soldier of the elite Polish Cichociemni unit, who took part in the raid on the Nazi German prison in Pińsk on 18 January 1943. Kopisto was shown the wartime photograph of Martin Gray (a.k.a. Mieczysław Grajewski) and said he had never seen Grajewski/Gray before in his life. Gray described his alleged participation in the same raid in his book For Those I Loved. Kopisto stated, when asked about any Jew in his unit alluding to Gray, that among the sixteen Polish soldiers in his partisan group there was in fact a Polish Jew from Warsaw by the name of Zygmunt Sulima, his own long-term friend and colleague after the war. No man like the one in the photograph of Gray ever belonged to their unit; Kopisto said: \\"For the first time in my life I saw Martin Gray in a 1945 photo, which was published in March 1990 in Przekrój magazine [...] There were only sixteen of us participating in the 1943 Pińsk raid, and he was not among us.\\"Jacek Stachiewicz interview with Major Wacław Kopisto (2 August 1990), \\"Kim jest Martin Gray?\\" (Who is Martin Gray) Nowiny Rzeszowskie (The Rzeszów News daily), Nr 163, 1990, p. 9 of scanned document, Scribd Inc.

They are two-time Raw Tag Team Champions, with Hawkins and Ryder being the youngest tag team, collectively, to hold the championship. The duo made their professional wrestling debut in 2004 as a tag team in New York Wrestling Connection, wrestling as Brian Myers and Brett Matthews. After the team signed with WWE, they would become almost exclusively tag team wrestlers. They debuted in WWE's main roster in 2007 on the ECW brand as Brian and Brett Major, collectively known as The Major Brothers. Later that year, they were repackaged and renamed to Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder as associates of Edge and subsequently aligned themselves with La Familia on the SmackDown brand. Nicknamed \\"The Rated-R Entourage\\" and \\"The Edgeheads\\", Hawkins and Ryder continued their alliance with Edge until the team split in April 2009, after Ryder was drafted back to the ECW brand as part of the 2009 WWE draft. After the team's split, Hawkins and Ryder sporadically teamed together in matches, but would not officially reunite until almost ten years later in January 2019. They would go on to capture the WWE Raw Tag Team Championships at WrestleMania 35 in April 2019.  History = New York Wrestling Connection (2004–2006) = The two debuted as a team in New York Wrestling Connection (NYWC) in 2004 with Matthew Cardona using the name Brett Matthews and Brian Myers using his real name. On May 21, 2005, they defeated the NYWC Tag Team Champions Dickie Rodz and Mason Raige by disqualification. At the next event on June 4, they won a rematch decisively to become Tag Team Champions. Later that month they were attacked by The Dead Presidents (Lo Lincoln and Boog Washington). Though they initially defended their titles against them in July, on August 27. On September 23 they were entered into a three-way match with the champions but Team Tremendous (Dan Barry and Ken Scampi) ended up with the belts. After continuing to win matches they re- earned a match against the champions and won the titles for the second time on January 25, 2006. They held the titles until they faced The B.S. Xpress (Tony Burma & Mike Spinelli), who defeated them for the gold on March 26. = World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE = Developmental territories (2006–2007)  Matthews and Myers moved to Deep South Wrestling (DSW) in Georgia tweaking their ring names to Brett and Brian Majors, appearing collectively as The Majors Brothers. They lost their debut match on June 1 to Montel Vontavious Porter and Eric Pérez. They picked up their first wins on June 15 against Francisco Ciatso and Cru Jones but lost a Four Way title contendership match in July to Urban Assault (Peréz and Sonny Siaki). They continued to feud with Ciatso who changed partners frequently but never defeated The Majors Brothers. After a six match winning streak they were given a match against The Untouchables (Dice Domino and Deuce Shade) who were reigning as DSW Tag Team Champions. On 12 October, The Majors Brothers became the new champions after the match was restarted following a double pin situation. As champions, the team became targets for aspiring champions and after their first title defence were attacked by Urban Assault. A scheduled match against them in November ended in double disqualification when The Gymini interfered in the match to attack both teams while a defence against The Gymini the following week saw another disqualification when Urban Assault made a return interference. The following week on November 30 The Majors Brothers lost their titles to Urban Assault. Their rematch went to a no contest when Urban Assault's manager G-Rilla began fighting with The Freakin' Deacon who was in The Majors' corner. After the DSW Tag Team Championship was vacated when the incumbents were released, The Majors were placed in a Three Way Tag Team match on January 19, 2007 for the titles, defeating The Samoan Fight Club (Afa Jr. and Siaki) and The Blue Bloods (William Regal and Dave Taylor) to become two-time champions. They held the championships briefly, losing them on 8 March to Team Elite (Derrick Neikirk and Mike Knox). The Majors stayed in DSW until April, exchanging victories with The Blue Bloods and teaming with Kofi Nahaje Kingston to defeat The Next Generation Hart Foundation (Harry Smith and TJ Wilson) and Shawn Osborne. Brian Majors pre-empted the tag team's first appearance in Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) on April 25's TV tapings in a 15-minute time limit draw against Jay Bradley. As a team they debuted on May 9 to pick up a win against Los Locos (Ramon and Paul) with a slightly tweaked name of The Major Brothers. After defeating Gothic Mayhem (Johnny Punch and Pat Buck) in successive matches they went on to defeat the reigning OVW Southern Tag Team Champions \\"The Hammer\\" Charles Evans and \\"The Ox\\" Justin LaRouche (future La Familia stablemate Bam Neely) twice in non-title matches, once by disqualification. These series of victories led to them facing Evans and LaRouche, joined by Dr. Thomas in a three-on-two handicap tag match on June 15 and winning the OVW Tag Team Championship. The former champions defeated them in a Four-Way Elimination Tag Team match the following week but a title match between the two of them on June 22 saw The Major Brothers retain. This was short lived though as they lost a non-title and subsequent title match to The James Boys (K.C. James and Kassidy James) on 29 June. Their rematch ended in a double countout and after this The Major Brothers won only by disqualification, by which titles can't change hands, but ultimately lost a decisive rematch on July 13. In October they shared a rivalry with Paul Burchill, initially winning against him and Drew McIntyre and then again against Burchill and Stu Sanders and finally The Empire (Sanders and McIntyre). They continued to win in a Four Corners Tag Team match against Los Locos, The Empire and LaRouche with Andrew Vain. They took this momentum into a tournament for the Southern Tag Team Championship defeating Gothic Mayhem and Los Locos in successive rounds before finally being defeated by Burchill and Sanders, thus failing to recapture the titles.  Main roster debut and La Familia (2007–2009)  The Major Brothers made their WWE television debut on the May 1, 2007 episode of ECW on Sci Fi defeating Matt Striker and Marcus Cor Von in a tag team match. They were depicted as an unknown team and their initial victory was the only win the team had in ECW. Following their debut match, they lost to the team of Elijah Burke and Marcus Cor Von, as well as both losing singles matches to Burke and Striker. The Majors were drafted from ECW to SmackDown! on June 17, 2007, as the eighth pick in the 2007 Supplemental Draft. Vignettes aired hyping their impending debut on the brand. On their July 6, 2007 SmackDown! debut, the Majors defeated Jeremy Young and Mike Foxx. The following week, the Majors were victorious again, defeating the team of Chavo Guerrero and Jamie Noble. After a loss to Deuce 'n Domino on August 17, 2007, The Majors would not compete on the show again until October 12, 2007, when the debuting Drew McIntyre defeated Brett. The following week, McIntyre defeated Brian. On November 9, 2007, they received a tag title match after winning a number one contender's battle royal, but could not defeat the champions, Montel Vontavious Porter and Matt Hardy. Hawkins and Ryder posing with Edge before the match At Armageddon, the Major Brothers dressed as Edge and interfered in the World Heavyweight Championship match, taking bumps in Edge's place to help him win the title and thus turning heel for the first time in their WWE career. On December 21, 2007, the Major Brothers were revealed as an acquaintance to Edge and his lover, SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero. The Major Brothers were repackaged and renamed, as Brett Major's name was changed to \\"Zack Ryder\\" and Brian Major to \\"Curt Hawkins\\". Occasionally teaming with their mentor Edge and/or their \\"La Familia\\" associate Chavo Guerrero on SmackDown, they even went on to be featured in the main event on multiple occasions. With this new gimmick, they were sometimes referred as \\"The Rated-R Entourage\\" by commentator Michael Cole. They also dropped the short trunks the team wore as the Major Brothers and started wearing long tights identical to Edge's tights. To differentiate between the two, Hawkins wore his hair in a ponytail. Later on, the team updated their attires, with Ryder debuting tights with new designs while Hawkins switched back to short trunks with new designs, and they began wearing sunglasses and a hoodie, respectively, to the ring. At The Great American Bash on July 20, 2008, Hawkins and Ryder won the WWE Tag Team Championship from John Morrison and The Miz in a fatal four-way match which also featured Jesse and Festus and Finlay and Hornswoggle after Hawkins pinned Jesse. Their victory meant that they collectively became the youngest tag team champions in WWE history. At SummerSlam, La Familia seemed to have ended when a returning Undertaker sent Edge to Hell and then refused to forgive Vickie - prompting all the members to abandon Vickie, who would later align with Big Show. On the September 26, 2008 airing of SmackDown, Hawkins and Ryder lost the titles to Carlito and Primo Colón in their first televised title defense. On December 5, 2008 episode of SmackDown, they returned in a tag team gauntlet match against Jeff Hardy and Triple H where they were the first and only team eliminated. They also participated in the battle royal for the last spot in the SmackDown Elimination Chamber match, but were eliminated by The Great Khali. On April 15, 2009, Ryder was drafted back to the ECW brand as part of the 2009 Supplemental Draft, separating the team.  Sporadic reunions (2011, 2016, 2018)  Hawkins and Ryder had a brief reunion in 2011, when Hawkins helped Ryder defeat Vladimir Kozlov on the May 12 episode of Superstars. On the May 19 episode of Superstars, Hawkins teamed with Ryder in a losing effort against Kozlov and Santino Marella, but the tag team didn't reform beyond this. They also had a brief reunion in 2016 alongside former La Familia leader Edge, where they are seen talking backstage using the lyrics of Edge's entrance music \\"Metalingus\\", before Edge himself shows up, after the 900th episode of SmackDown Live went off the air. In 2018, Hawkins and Ryder became co-hosts of the WWE Network series \\"Zack and Curt Figure It Out\\". On the November 14, 2018 edition of WWE Main Event, Hawkins and Ryder teamed up for the first time since 2011 in a loss to Apollo Crews and Tyler Breeze.  Reformation (2019–2020)  Prior to the team's reformation, both Hawkins and Ryder were struggling as singles competitors; by the end of 2018, Hawkins had lost over 200 consecutive matches and Ryder had not appeared on WWE television in 2018 until the final Raw episode of the year. On the January 21, 2019 episode of Raw, Hawkins was attacked by The Revival. Ryder came to Hawkins' aid, foreshadowing a reunion. On the January 28 episode of Raw, Hawkins and Ryder made their official reunion facing The Revival in a losing effort after Hawkins was pinned by Dash Wilder. On April 5, WWE announced that Hawkins and Ryder would face The Revival at WrestleMania 35 for the Raw Tag Team Championship. At the event's Kickoff Show, the duo won the Raw Tag Team Championships, subsequently breaking Hawkins' 269-match losing streak. The following night on Raw, they successfully defended their titles in a rematch against The Revival, thus breaking Ryder's \\"WrestleMania curse\\" of losing a championship after winning it the night before at WrestleMania. At The Shield's Final Chapter, Hawkins and Ryder once again successfully defended the belts against The Revival and Aleister Black and Ricochet in a triple threat match. Following that, the team was largely absent from television mainly appearing on live events. Even though they were the champions, they only made one appearance on WWE programming during the month of May, a loss to the Viking Raiders on May 6.https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/usos-added-raw-tag- team-titles-match-wwe-raw The duo returned during the 51-Man Battle Royal at the 2019 Super Showdown, but they were both eliminated during the match. On the following episode of Raw, Hawkins and Ryder lost the titles against The Revival in a triple threat match that also involved The Usos.https://www.wwe.com/videos/zack-ryder-curt-hawkins-vs-the-usos-vs-the- revival-%E2%80%93-raw-tag-team-championship-triple-threat On April 15, 2020, Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder were released from their WWE contracts as part of budget cuts due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In May, Cardona revealed that both he and Myers wouldn't continue teaming on the independent circuit.  Other media  On August 23, 2018, Hawkins and Ryder started The Major Wrestling Figure Podcast. In the episodes, they talk about their one of their favorite hobbies, collecting wrestling figures, and other topics relating to professional wrestling and action figures.

The current monastery, housing a group of 8 benedictin nuns, is located to the east of the river, while the archaeological monastery of the early Middle Ages was located on the west. The medieval history of the monastery appears in the Chronicon Vulturnense, an illuminated manuscript. A monk of the monastery, Iohannes, composed the Chronicle in circa 1130, using sources from the eighth, ninth and tenth centuries which were available to him, probably in the monastery archives, as well as hagiographic inclusions about some of the historic figures.V. Federici, ed. Chronicon Vulturnense del monaco Giovanni, 3 vols. (Fonti per la storia d'Italia 58-60) (Rome, 1925-38). The aims of the Chronicle may have been to codify the memory of the community and its history in the face of Norman expansion in southern Italy. The manuscript, written in a Beneventan hand and including numerous images, is housed at the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, BAV Barb. lat. 2724. The monastery has been the subject of long- running archaeological investigation, which took place in a number of campaigns. In the 1970s Dom Angelo Pantoni, a monk from Monte Cassino excavated the area to the east of the river, where the later medieval monastery was built. The San Vincenzo Project began in 1980, led by Richard Hodges, then of the University of Sheffield, and the Soprintendenza archaeologica del Molise. Excavation continued between 1980-1986,R. Hodges, ed. San Vincenzo al Volturno 1: The 1980-1986 Excavations, vol. 1 (London, 1993), vol. 2 (London, 1995). in the area around the so-called Crypt of Epiphanius and the monastery on the west side of the river Volturno. These scientific excavations continued through the 1980s and 1990s under the direction of Hodges and with the support of the British School at Rome, the abbey of Monte Cassino, and the Soprintendenza archaeologica del Molise. From 1999, the project has been directed by Federico Marazzi, of the Istituto Universitario Suor Orsola Benincasa, Naples. History Archangel Raphael, from the mid-ninth century (San Vincenzo al Volturno) The monastery was founded on a site which had been occupied in the pre-Roman period by Samnite peoples, and which had a villa or estate in the early to mid-fifth century. The late-antique fortified estate was abandoned in the fifth century, then in the mid-fifth century, a funerary church was constructed.Hodges, San Vincenzo al Volturno 1; Hodges, San Vincenzo al Volturno 2; Hodges, Light in the Dark Ages. The Rise and Fall of San Vincenzo al Volturno (London / Ithaca: Duckworth / Cornell University Press, 1997) According to the Chronicon Vulturnense, the monastery was founded by three noblemen from Benevento named Paldo, Tato and Taso, in 731. The story goes that they were advised to found the monastery on the banks of the Volturno by the abbot of the powerful Abbey of Farfa, north of Rome. Thomas of Maurienne, the abbot of Farfa, suggested the site because, according to the Chronicle, it was home to an oratory founded by Constantine I. The Chronicle's emphasis on the Beneventan origin of the founders suggests that the early monastery enjoyed the patronage of the dukes of Benevento. With the rise of the Franks and the development of the Papal states, the monastery's location on the border of Lombard and papal/Frankish territory became increasingly strategic. The abbots of the monastery in the late eighth century alternated between Franks and Lombards: Ambrosius Autpertus, elected 777, was a Frank; Poto, elected 781, was a Lombard. He was accused of disloyalty to the Franks for refusing to chant a hymn in honour of the Frankish family. The rest of the monks were obliged to swear an oath of loyalty. Charlemagne conceded fiscal and jurisdictional privileges to the community, making it one of the most independent and powerful abbeys of Europe. The abbots Iosue, Talaricus and Epiphanius in the early ninth century increased the numbers of monks to over 300 and expanded the territories and possessions all over central and southern Italy.For discussion, see G. West, \\"Charlemagne's involvement in central and southern Italy: power and the limits of authority,\\" Early Medieval Europe 8 (1999), pp. 241-67. Between 779 and 873 the monastery was in constant dispute with the peasants of the Valle Trita over dues and labour. The Chronicle reports that in 848 the abbey was damaged by an earthquake. In 860, Sawdan, emir of Bari, was paid a handsome tribute not to sack the monastery. In 881, however, Saracens paid by the Duke of Naples, Athanasius, burned and raided the monastery. Surviving monks fled to Capua. They returned in 914 to reconstruct a monastery, but only at the end of the tenth century were they able to reestablish the community in a permanent way, and then with the aid of the emperors Otto II and Otto III. The location of the monastery was transferred to a new, more defensible position on the east side of the river. In 1115 Pope Paschal II consecrated the new abbey church. The twelfth-century Norman conquest of Abruzzo eventually led to the breakdown of the monastery's power. In 1349 a new earthquake destroyed the monastery and left the area open to the expansion of the abbey of Monte Cassino. The monastery was occupied by increasingly fewer monks, and from the fifteenth century it was governed externally. In 1669 the monastery and all its remaining properties were awarded to Monte Cassino. The monastery was bombed in World War II and severely damaged. In 1989 San Vincenzo al Volturno became home to a new monastic community, the Benedictine nuns of the Connecticut Abbey of Regina Laudis who had to leave the monastery in 2015. During the earthquake of 2016 another monastic foundation brought eight young benedictin nuns to the Abbey of S. Vincenzo, willing to continue monastic life in the millenary abbey.

The original palace, built for King Bayinnaung in 1556, consisted of 76 apartments and halls. It was burned down in 1599. It was reconstructed in 1990 and finished in 1992. Kanbawzathadi Golden Palace in Bago is a reconstruction of the original Royal palace from the second half of the 16th century. The very ornate golden palace gives a good impression of the splendor and wealth of the second Burmese empire. It was rebuilt following the original design, based on knowledge gained from excavations and the original drawings of the building. The huge palace consisted of 76 apartments and halls. The reconstructed palace does not contain much of the original furniture and personal items used by the Royals, as most of it was lost when the palace was looted and destroyed in 1599. There are several reproductions on display, like a replica of the King’s golden coach, decorated with two peacocks and a Pyatthat style roof.  King Bayinnaung of the Taungoo dynasty  The palace dates from a very prosperous time in Burmese history. It was built by King Bayinnaung of the Taungoo dynasty, a vast empire that included much of present-day Burma, Thailand and parts of China. Bayinnaung was one of Burma’s greatest rulers, a mighty King who possessed many white elephants, a sign of wealth and power at that time. The King even obtained a sacred Buddha tooth relic from Sri Lanka, which he had installed in the Mahazedi Pagoda. Bayinnaung built the new capital of the second Burmese empire, a large city called Hanthawadi (present day Bago) surrounded by walls with 20 gates. The palace was built on a 70 acres plot located at the center of the city. Construction started in 1553. Records written by European visitors to the city tell about the magnificence and splendor of the richly gilded palace. Some of its buildings like the Great Audience Hall were roofed with gold plates. The palace was looted and burnt down in 1599 during armed conflict. Its remains were abandoned, and the palace was not rebuild until the late 20th century. Excavation works started in 1990. Six mounds were excavated, revealing the brick foundations of several of the palace buildings. Several hundred of the original teak pillars used for the construction of the palace in the 16th century were found, many of them inscribed with Mon texts, as well as nearly 2,000 Buddha images.  The reconstructed palace  Several buildings of the palace have been rebuilt. The Great Audience Hall was the largest building in the palace. It was the place where the King received his ministers and officials. The hall is also known as the Royal Lion Throne Hall, because it contained the Thihathana Throne or Lion Throne. During excavations a number of 167 teak pillars were found, 135 of which are inscribed in Mon language with the names of towns, regions and people who donated them in the 16th century. The Great Audience Hall is a huge hall with rows of large pillars supporting the roof, its interior completely covered in gold paint. A copy of one of the Royal thrones as well as a number of the original 16th century teak logs are exhibited. The Bhammayarthana Throne Hall, also called Bee Throne Hall contained the private quarters for the King, including the Royal bed chamber and living chamber. This very ornate building has multiple roof sections and false floors, and is topped with a Pyatthat, a seven tiered Burmese style roof. Other buildings contained the chambers of members of the Royal family. There used to be 9 Royal Thrones in the Kanbawzathadi Golden palace, each decorated with a different motif and used for different occasions. Eight of them were destroyed by fire, the only surviving is the Thihathana Throne, also called Lion Throne because of the lion figures carved on it. The gilded, hard wood throne is on display in the National Museum in Yangon.  Palace Museum  On the palace grounds is the Nandawya research museum, which exhibits items and artifacts found during the excavations, as well as information about the history of the second empire. On display are a number of the original 16th- century teak pillars and items like pottery, scales and weights used for commerce, ancient coins, glazed jars, swords and other weapons. The museum also contains a collection of 16th-century Buddha images in Mon, Siamese and Burmese styles from the palace.  How to get to Kanbawzathadi Golden Palace  The golden palace is found South of the Shwemawdaw pagoda, East of NH1 National Highway in Bago. Getting there by trishaw from the downtown area should not cost more than 1,000 Kyat.  Entrance fee & opening hours  The palace opens daily from 9 am until 5 pm, except on Burmese national holidays and important Buddhist holidays. It is one of the few historical sites in Bago for which the Bago archeological zone ticket is 10,000 Ks. Admission to the palace is Bago archeological zone ticket 10,000 Ks per person.

She was reportedly a good student, with an interest in literature, and corresponded with her teacher Johan Skytte in Latin at the age of ten.Maria Elisabet, urn:sbl:9107, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Lars- Olof Skoglund), hämtad 2018-02-20. =Marriage= In 1610, Maria Elizabeth was engaged to marry her cousin, Prince John of Sweden, Duke of Ostrogothia. The reason for the marriage was political and arranged by the bride's mother, queen Christina.Maria Elisabet, urn:sbl:9107, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Lars-Olof Skoglund), hämtad 2018-02-20. John was the son of former King John III of Sweden and had rights to the throne which exceeded those of Maria Elizabeth's father. Although he had given up these rights and was not an ambitious person, there were concerns that he might become a threat if he were to marry a foreign Princess.Maria Elisabet, urn:sbl:9107, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Lars-Olof Skoglund), hämtad 2018-02-20. The wedding was met with opposition from the clergy, who complained both about the close relationship between the bride and the groom, which was not in accordance with the 1571 års kyrkoordning, as well as not having been consulted about it, but they were silenced by queen Christina, who stated that the matter was a secular question.Maria Elisabet, urn:sbl:9107, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Lars-Olof Skoglund), hämtad 2018-02-20. On 29 November 1612, at the age of sixteen, Princess Maria Elizabeth celebrated her wedding to the Duke of Ostrogothia in the royal palace Tre Kronor in Stockholm. The duke and duchess hosted a luxurious court in their residences at Vadstena Castle and Bråborg Castle in the Duchy of Ostrogothia. The marriage is described as unhappy, and Maria Elizabeth blamed her mother for having arranged it.Maria Elisabet, urn:sbl:9107, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Lars-Olof Skoglund), hämtad 2018-02-20. Reportedly, none of the spouses was emotionally involved or happy about the marriage, and it was believed to have had a negative effect on both of their health.Maria Elisabet, urn:sbl:9107, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Lars-Olof Skoglund), hämtad 2018-02-20. Duke John suffered from increasing depression from 1613 onward, and from the summer of the following year, Maria Elizabeth was affected by periods of insanity \\"from which she recovered only periodically her remaining days onward.\\"Maria Elisabet, urn:sbl:9107, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Lars-Olof Skoglund), hämtad 2018-02-20. During her periods of insanity, she occasionally lost her ability to speak, and was kept under guard, as there were fears that she would attempt suicide.Maria Elisabet, urn:sbl:9107, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Lars-Olof Skoglund), hämtad 2018-02-20. Queen Christina is said to have regretted having arranged the marriage.Maria Elisabet, urn:sbl:9107, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Lars-Olof Skoglund), hämtad 2018-02-20. Her illness caused great concern, and her mother often visited her in the Duchy to attend her during her illness, and her brother King Gustavus Adolphus often sent his personal royal physician to attend her.Maria Elisabet, urn:sbl:9107, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Lars-Olof Skoglund), hämtad 2018-02-20. =Witch hunt= The royal couple ruled quite independently in their Duchy. John had the right to issue new laws, and Maria Elizabeth evidently had influence on his rule. During the six years they lived together in Ostrogothia, a witch hunt was conducted in the duchy, for which they, and Maria Elizabeth in particular, are considered to be responsible. A woman was executed in Söderköping, after being accused of having cast a spell on the royal couple. The personal priest of Maria Elizabeth, Claudius Prytz, was very active in this matter. The duke issued a new law which made it easier to judge and execute witches, which led to the Finspång witch trial; > \\"Two evil and reputed sorceresses, which Their Graces Duke Johan and his > noble consort Maria Elizabeth upon the word of God destroyed, were burned at > a place called Skogby vad\\".Ankarloo, Bengt, Satans raseri: en sannfärdig > berättelse om det stora häxoväsendet i Sverige och omgivande länder, > Ordfront, Stockholm, 2007 Seven women were executed in Finspång in 1617. After this, there were few witch trials in Sweden. When the great witch frenzy of 1668–1676 broke out, the witch hunt of the 1610s in Ostrogothia was remembered and pointed out as a warning example by those sceptical towards the belief in witches. Lord High Steward Per Brahe warned: > \\"To be strict with those affected, as they believe in too much which is not > real, and executions, will only increase this, as happened in the time of > Duke John\\", and: \\"The Prime Minister was reminded of the Princess of duke > John. She started to burn some, and in the end, there was not a wife who was > not accused\\".Ankarloo, Bengt, Satans raseri: en sannfärdig berättelse om det > stora häxoväsendet i Sverige och omgivande länder, Ordfront, Stockholm, 2007 Ten such executions are confirmed. After the death of Maria Elizabeth, the witch hunt was put to an end. = Death = On 5 March 1618, she was widowed when Duke John died at Bråborg. Princess Maria Elizabeth was 22 years old and retired to Stegeborg Castle. She died childless 'of her lifelong disease' just five months after her husband; according to the royal chaplain Petrus Bjugg, death was a relief to her.Maria Elisabet, urn:sbl:9107, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Lars-Olof Skoglund), hämtad 2018-02-20. She was buried next to her spouse at Linköping Cathedral in January 1619.

It received worldwide recognition and helped create a myth around Eric Clapton. \\"Clapton is God\\" is a 1960s meme referencing the English guitarist Eric Clapton. The line was popularised after being spray-painted on a wall in London during the mid-1960s, when Clapton was a member of the Yardbirds and John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers. Overview The earliest known use of the phrase appeared in the form of graffiti spray-painted by an unknown admirer on a wall at the Islington Tube Station in Islington, London. Commentators traced the year of origin variously to 1965, early 1966, and 1967. Soon after, the proclamation could be seen scrawled at numerous spots around London, such as on club bathroom walls and construction sites. It also appeared around New York. In 2016, Clapton speculated that the original graffiti was painted by Hamish Grimes, a promoter who worked for the Yardbirds' manager. Clapton was initially humbled by the slogan. Later, he said he had become embarrassed by it, saying in his The South Bank Show profile in 1987, \\"I never accepted that I was the greatest guitar player in the world. I always wanted to be the greatest guitar player in the world, but that's an ideal, and I accept it as an ideal\\".Clapton Documentary (1987). South Bank Show. ITV. In popular culture * Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac was nicknamed the \\"Green God\\" as a reference to the \\"Clapton is God\\" graffiti. * In 1990, the political cartoon strip Doonesbury ran a controversial story arc involving the character Andy Lippincott and his terminal battle with AIDS, which concludes with Lippincott expressing his admiration for the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds. One of the last panels depicts the character's last written words scrawled on a notebook: \\"Brian Wilson is God\\", a wry reference to \\"Clapton is God\\".

It stars Anthony Hopkins, Shirley MacLaine and Bo Derek. The film was a critical and commercial failure, grossing $7.2 million against its $6 million budget and receiving three nominations at the 1st Golden Raspberry Awards including Worst Actor (Hopkins), Worst Screenplay. Plot When fortysomething Karyn Evans discovers her arrogantly self-centered professor husband Adam is having an affair with student Lindsey Rutledge, she retaliates by having a dalliance of her own with young, philosophical campus carpenter Pete Lachappelle. Adam is infuriated when he learns about his wife's new relationship, and she in turn defends her right to enjoy the same carnal pleasures he does. The four decide to share a Vermont ski house, where their efforts to behave like liberal adults are tested by middle-age angst, hurt feelings, and teenager Kasey Evans (played by Mary Beth Hurt who was 34 at the time), who unexpectedly arrives to confront her parents with their outrageous behavior. Production notes The film was shot on location in Glenwood Springs, Colorado and Williamstown, Massachusetts. Hopkins and MacLaine famously did not get along during the filming and Hopkins said \\"she was the most obnoxious actress I have ever worked with.\\" The theme song \\"Where Do You Catch The Bus For Tomorrow?\\" was written by Alan and Marilyn Bergman and Henry Mancini and performed by Kenny Rankin. Originally, Noel Black was hired to direct after producer Martin Ransohoff saw his film, A Man, a Woman, and a Bank (1979). Black left the film during shooting due to creative differences. He was replaced by Richard Lang. Black shot the first half of the film only. Consenting Adults was the film's working title. Principal cast *Shirley MacLaine ..... Karyn Evans *Anthony Hopkins .....

Man at Table Critical reception In his review in The New York Times, Vincent Canby said the film \\"exhibits no sense of humor and no appreciation for the ridiculous … the screenplay [is] often dreadful … the only appealing performance is Miss MacLaine's, and she's too good to be true. A Change of Seasons does prove one thing, though. A farce about characters who've been freed of their conventional obligations quickly becomes aimless.\\" Variety observed, \\"It would take the genius of an Ernst Lubitsch to do justice to the incredibly tangled relationships in A Change of Seasons, and director Richard Lang is no Lubitsch. The switching of couples seems arbitrary and mechanical, and more sour than amusing.\\" TV Guide rates it one out of a possible four stars, adding the film \\"is as predictable as a long Arctic winter, and just about as interesting … Marybeth Hurt … steals what there is of the picture to steal.\\" Time Out London calls it \\"kitsch without conviction, schlock without end … glib trappings … and witless dialogue sink everything except for the perky intelligence of MacLaine, who clearly deserves better than this.\\"Time Out London review Awards and nominations *1st Golden Raspberry Award * Nominated, Worst Actor (Anthony Hopkins) * Nominated, \\"Worst Original Song\\" – For the song, Where Do You Catch the Bus Tomorrow?

Since their discovery in 1982, halocins have been demonstrated to be diverse in a similar ways as the other bacteriocins. Some are large proteins, some small polypeptides (microhalocins). This diversity is surprising for a number of reasons, including the original presumptions that Archaea, particularly extremophiles, live at relatively low densities under conditions that may not require antagonistic behavior. The genetics, mechanism of production and mechanism of action of the halocins have been studied, but not exhaustively. The ecology of the halocins has been investigated as well. One interesting observation is that the halocins are active across the major divisions of archaea, thus violating the dogma that they should be most effective against the most closely related strains. Halocins are particularly interesting because of the way the pore-forming bacteriocins have been used to probe cell membrane structure and the production and maintenance of energetic ion gradients across the membrane. The halophiles live at such extreme ion concentrations that they represent a set of unusual solutions and adaptations with regard to their energetic gradients. The ability to use native halocins to study these gradients provides a motivation for their characterization. They may have a role in human medicine. They are also found in many of the type species that are used to learn about halophiles in general. Like other bacteriocins, the halocins are under investigation as antimicrobials for use in controlling spoilage during industrial processes; in this case, leather production. Because the literature about halocins is relatively circumscribed, it can be exhaustively cited. Several times they have been addressed in book chapters.

His other titles were prince de Talmont and comte of Taillebourg and comte of Guînes and comte of Benon and baron of Craon and baron of Royan and baron of Sully and baron of L'Ile-Bouchard and baron of Brandois and baron of Mauléon and baron of Mareuil and baron of Marans and baron of Rochefort and baron of Sainte-Hermine and baron of Doué. Life The la Trémoille family, inheriting the county of Laval after the death of Guy XX of the Laval family, the last representative of that county's direct line. This inheritance obliged the descendants of Anne of Laval, and of François de la Trémoille, to come to stay on the banks of the Mayenne occasionally. On 31 October 1537 François lost the châtellenie of Rochefort. In effect, a decree of the parlement de Paris dating to 10 March 1536 reunited Rochefort with his domain. The royal officers, always attentive to conserving the interests of their master, were justified by the tenacity of the La Trémoille family, shown especially by a royal debt of 18 000 écus to the family since the battle of Castillon in 1453. On 23 January 1521 he married Anne de Montfort-Laval (1505–1554), daughter of Guy XVI de Laval and of Charlotte d'Aragon-Naples. Their 10 children were : * Louis III de la Trémoille who succeeded his father * François, count of Benon and baron of Montagu († 1555), who married Françoise du Bouchet, * Charles, baron of Mauléon and baron of Marans, abbot of Saint-Laon. * Georges, baron of Royan and baron of Olonne and lord (seigneur) of Saujon and of Kergolay († December 1584), who married Madeleine de Luxembourg (daughter of François II vicomte de Martigues) (they were the parents of Gilbert, baron then from October 1592 marquis of Royan, and baron then from January 1600 count of Olonne, who died 25 July 1603), * Claude, baron of Noirmoutiers and lord of Mornac, of Châteauneuf-sur-Sarthe, of Saint-Germain, of Buron, and of La Roche-Diré († 1566), who married Antoinette de Maillé, * Louise baroness of Rochefort († 1569) who married Philippe de Lévis, * Jacqueline, baroness of Marans, of Sainte-Hermine, of Brandois, and of La Mothe-Achard († 1599), who married Louis IV de Bueil, comte de Sancerre, * Charlotte who became a nun.

A younger contemporary of Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari, Jean Baudrillard, Paul Virilio and Michel Foucault, he is best known for synthesizing French theory with American literary, cultural and architectural avant-garde movements through his work with Semiotext(e);\\"Semiotext at the Biennial: An Interview with Hedi el Kholti.\\" Hyperallergic May 17, 2014. and for his interpretations of French theory in a 21st-century context. An influential interpreter of Jean Baudrillard's theories, Lotringer invented the concept \\"extrapolationist\\" as a means of describing the hyperbolic world-views espoused by Baudrillard and Paul Virilio. Lotringer is a Professor of Art Theory at the Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts (IDSVA) in Portland, Maine, where he teaches ethico-aesthetics. He was married to Chris Kraus. Life and work Sylvère Lotringer was born in Paris to Polish-Jewish immigrants who left Warsaw for France in 1930. His early life was marked by the Nazi occupation of Paris, which — like his contemporaries Georges Perec and Sarah Kofman — he spent as a \\"hidden child\\" with documents forged by the French Resistance. As an interpreter of French theory, Lotringer has sought to contextualize the pre- modernist origins of \\"postmodern\\" French thought. Writing about Jean Baudrillard's childhood, Lotringer reminds us just how far his generation has traveled to reach The Matrix. He recalls the 11-year-old Jean and his grandparents riding an oxcart loaded with mattresses from Reims to Paris during the massive evacuation of the French populace that marked the onset of the War. In 1949, Lotringer immigrated to Israel with his family and returned to Paris the year after to join the left-wing Zionist movement Hashomer- Hatzair (The Young Garde) and became one of its leaders. He left the movement eight years later. In 1957, while still at the lycée, Lotringer joined the editorial collective of La Ligne Generale headed by Georges Perec. Taking its name from Sergei Eisenstein's famous film The General Line, this group of brilliant young Jewish men favored Hollywood westerns, slapstick and pre- Stalinist communism. The project was praised by Henri Lefebvre but strongly criticized by Simone de Beauvoir, who found it \\"politically irresponsible\\". Entering the Sorbonne in 1958, Lotringer created with Nicole Chardaire L’Etrave, a literary magazine, and contributed to Paris-Lettres, the journal of the French Students' Association (1959–61). As President of the Sorbonne, he led mobilizations against France's colonial Algerian war. In 1964, he entered the École Pratique des Hautes Etudes, VIe section (Sociology) writing a doctoral dissertation on Virginia Woolf's novels under the supervision of Roland Barthes and Lucien Goldmann. His work was aided by his friendship with Leonard Woolf and his acquaintance with T.S. Eliot and Vita Sackville-West, with whom he conducted interviews published in Louis Aragon's journal Les Lettres Francaises, for which Lotringer served as a correspondent for ten years. Avoiding French military service in Algeria, Lotringer spent 1962 in the US and two years (1965–67) teaching for the French Cultural Services in Erzurum, Turkey. He finally returned to the US via Australia in 1969 with a teaching appointment at Swarthmore College. He joined the French and Comparative Literature Faculty at Columbia University in 1972, where he is Professor Emeritus. Cultural synthesis Arriving in New York City in the early 1970s, Lotringer saw the opportunity to introduce French theorists whose work, at that time, was largely unknown in the US to New York's burgeoning artistic and literary community. Marxism had bottomed out in France and post-’68 philosophers had turned to capitalism, eager to extract from it the subversive energy no longer found in class struggles. Lotringer realized that America could be these theorists’ testing-ground. Playing chess in the West Village with John Cage, Lotringer sensed similarities between Thoreau and the \\"chance operations\\" being practiced by Fluxus, William S. Burroughs, Brion Gysin and others, and the Nietzsche-inspired poststructuralist theorists. Uninspired by the doctrinaire post-Frankfurt School Marxism of the American Left, he sought to introduce independently the more fluid and rhizomatic ideas of power and desire developed by Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari, and Michel Foucault. A few years later he discovered Paul Virilio's theory of speed and technology and Jean Baudrillard's analysis of consumer culture's infinite exchangeability, introducing them in turn into American political discourse. Towards this end, he founded the journal Semiotext(e) with a group of Columbia University graduate students. After producing three scholarly issues on the epistemology of semiotics, Lotringer and his group staged the provocative \\"Schizo-Culture\\" conference on \\"Madness and Prisons\\" in 1975 at Columbia University, where more than 2,000 attendees witnessed \\"show-downs\\" between Michel Foucault, conspiracy theorist Lyndon LaRouche, Félix Guattari, feminist Ti-Grace Atkinson, Ronald D. Laing and others. The event helped define a new mode of cultural discourse over the coming decade, and set the stage for future issues of Semiotexte, which abandoned its scholarly format in favor of collaged images and texts by Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, Jean-François Lyotard, Guy Hocquenghem, Jacques Derrida, Heiner Müller and their (as Lotringer saw it) American counterparts: John Cage, William S. Burroughs, Richard Foreman, Jack Smith, Kathy Acker, and others. This provocative mix of street and academy, theory, art and politics, would become Semiotexte's trademark. In 1978, Lotringer staged \\"The Nova Convention\\", a three-day homage to William S. Burroughs at the Entermedia Theater at NYU and Irving Plaza in New York City's East Village. Featuring performances and talks by Patti Smith, Frank Zappa, Laurie Anderson, Robert Anton Wilson, Timothy Leary, and Burroughs himself, the event acclaimed Burroughs as \\"a philosopher of the future [...] the man who best understood post-industrial society\\", and popularized his work among New York's punk \\"no-wave\\" generation. Recognizing that the collectivity that once marked New York's cultural life was fast disappearing in the 1980s, Lotringer ceased regular publication of the Semiotexte journal in 1985, though book-length issues occasionally appeared into the 1990s. In its place, he instituted the Semiotexte Foreign Agents series – a collection of \\"little black books\\" by French theorists. Published with no introductions or afterwords, the books were conceived to present \\"theory brut\\" like champagne into the American cultural marketplace. The series debuted in 1983 with Jean Baudrillard's Simulations, excerpted by Lotringer from Symbolic Exchange and Death (Galilée, Paris: 1977) and Simulacra and Simulations (Gallimard, Paris: 1981). An instant classic, Simulations spawned a new art movement and served as the theoretical template for the 1999 Keanu Reeves movie, The Matrix. Simulations was followed later that year by Pure War, his book-length conversation with Paul Virilio, in which the \\"philosopher of speed\\" expounded his vision of bunker archeology, accidents and dromology. The last, On the Line, by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, included \\"Rhizome\\", which anticipated Internet culture. New politics Defining himself as a \\"foreign agent provocateur\\" in the US, Lotringer traveled to Italy in 1979-80 to document first-hand Italy's embattled post-Marxist Autonomia movement and secure their legacy. His participant-observation with the innovative political movement resulted in Italy: Autonomia – Post-Political Politics, a 1980 special publication of Semiotexte. In 1992, he sought out former Black Panther Dhoruba al-Mujahid bin Wahad, who had just been provisionally released from prison after spending 19 years incarcerated on a charge of \\"sedition\\". Lotringer invited Dhoruba to produce a Semiotexte book vindicating and updating the Black Panther Party's position. The result was Still Black, Still Strong, an anthology of writings by Assata Shakur, Mumia Abu-Jamal and Bin-Wahad. In 2001, Lotringer co-edited the ironically titled Hatred of Capitalism: A Semiotexte Reader. Released in the wake of the September 11 attacks, the anthology strove to clarify Semiotexte's composite vision of politics, intelligence and radical humor. Summing up the Semiotexte self-styled mission, Lotringer used an observation made to him by filmmaker Jack Smith as an epigraph: \\"The world is starving for thoughts. If you can think of something, the language will fall into place, but the thought is what's going to do it\\". Realizing that the Foreign Agents books of the 1980s were being absorbed within mainstream academe, Lotringer sought out new works that would address global politics from the perspective of activism. He commissioned Israeli journalist Amira Hass' award-winning Reporting From Ramallah (2003), and French military specialist 's Empire of Disorder (2002) for Semiotexte. Resuming his dialogue with Paul Virilio in Crepuscular Dawn (2002), he pushed the philosopher to elaborate on the historical antecedents and repercussions of genetic engineering. His third dialogue with Virilio, Accident of Art (2006), expanded the Virilian notion of \\"accident\\" to encompass the impact of war on contemporary art. In 2006, he returned to his interest in Italian political theory, commissioning and publishing works by Paolo Virno, Franco Piperno, Christian Marazzi and Antonio Negri. Influence Teaching 20th century French literature and philosophy at Columbia University for more than 30 years, Lotringer elaborated the connections between modernist literature and fascism in his many lectures, interpreting the \\"crazed modernists\\" Antonin Artaud, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Simone Weil, Georges Bataille as harbingers of the Jewish Holocaust. As a scholar of the 20th century, he emphasized the experiential, \\"pre-modern\\" political roots of French theories that are often misread as cavalier orgies of cruelty, envisaging them as an attempt to create symbolic antidotes to both fascism and consumerism. A legendary teacher on the order of Lycée Henri IV's famed Alain, Lotringer's classes influenced the work of dozens of his former students, including filmmaker Kathryn Bigelow, semiotician Marshall Blonsky, art critics Tim Griffin and John Kelsey, actor Jim Fletcher and poet Ariana Reines. He appears as a quasi-fictional character in Kathy Acker's Great Expectations and My Mother, Demonology, in Chris Kraus' I Love Dick and Torpor and in Eileen Myles' Inferno.

The school is located in 18 Tat Chee Avenue, Yau Yat Chuen, Sham Shui Po of the Kowloon District of Hong Kong. Motto *Wisdom (智): to pursue knowledge *Courage (勇): to accept challenges and responsibilities *Diligence (勤): to be a lifelong learner *Perseverance (奮): to achieve targets School Motto Founder Joseph Cucchiara (郭怡雅) Sisters Announcers of the Lord (顯主女修會).''' Joseph Cucchiara (郭怡雅) was born on the island of Sicily in Italy in 1889. He joined the Salesians of Don Bosco in 1907. After the outbreak of World War I, he followed the armies and served in hospitals. He was delegated to the diocese of Shiu Chow of Kwangtung (Guangdong) in 1911. He founded many churches and schools in the area. After communists came to the area, most of these structures fell under the control of the communists. He was then sent to work at the Aberdeen Technical School in Hong Kong. In the meantime, he helped the sisters of Sisters Announcers of the Lord from Shiu Chow to Hong Kong. He dedicated much effort to help the sisters open Tak Nga Primary School and Tak Nga Secondary School. He died in Canossa Hospital on 18 December 1966 and was buried in Happy Valley, Hong Kong. The sisters from Sisters Announcers of the Lord founded a school on Tsing Yi Island and named it Father Cucchiara Memorial School to remember his contribution. School History In 1954, the Sisters of the Announcers of the Lord, following the fervent and enthusiastic preaching of St Theresa, formally began their missionary activities in Cheung Sha Wan. Under the leadership of the late Salesian Priest Reverend Father Joseph Cucchiara, the services provided by the Sisters were broadened. On 25 July 1956, which was the feast day of St. Jacob, the Sisters were granted permission by the late Bishop of Hong Kong, His Excellency Bishop Bianchi, to establish a school in Hong Kong. The word ‘Tak’ was derived from the Chinese name of St. Theresa to denote the Sisters’ desire to teach youngsters to follow the good example of St. Theresa, so that they would become good children of the Lord and fine citizens of society. The word ‘Nga’ was taken from the Chinese name of St. Jacob because the Sisters wanted to commemorate the spirit of St. Jacob. These were the origins of the name of our school ‘Tak Nga’. The founder of our school, the late Reverend Father Joseph Cucchiara, was determined to surmount all difficulties in establishing the school. On 15 November 1958, a parcel of Crown land of 13755 square feet on Tat Chee Avenue in Yau Yat Chuen was granted by the Hong Kong Government to build Tak Nga Primary School. The construction of Tak Nga was started on 25 February 1960. In order to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the martyrdom of Bishop Versiglia, Founder of the Congregation of Sisters ‘Announcers of the Lord’, the school was named ‘Bishop Versiglia Tak Nga School’. The construction of the school building was almost finished in September 1960 when three classrooms were generously offered by the parish priest of St. Teresa’s Parish for the school’s temporary use. Tak Nga was moved to the new school building on 20 February 1961 when the construction was completed. Mr. Corkburn, Assistant Director of Education, and Mrs. Corkburn were the guests of honour in our opening ceremony in September 1961, which signified the beginning of Tak Nga’s contribution to the education in Hong Kong. In its early years, Tak Nga only ran a primary section. Thanks to the insight of Father Joseph Cucchiara, who showed concern about the further education of Tak Nga’s pupils, the building of the secondary section of Tak Nga was then planned. Permission was granted by the Director of Education to build a secondary section on 1 May 1962. Lessons in the secondary section started in the same year. On 9 March 1963, the government granted a site of 19410 square feet adjacent to the primary section for the building of our secondary section, which was completed in 1964 and was blessed by His Excellency II Nuncio monsigneur Caprio on 3 November in the same year. On 11 January 1965, all students started to have their lessons in the new building of the secondary section, and Bishop Bianchi officially blessed the school during a Thanksgiving mass on 3 July 1965. Tak Nga Secondary School first ran both a Chinese middle school and an English Secondary Section to suit the students’ needs. Later in 1976, the English Secondary Section increased her capacity while the Chinese middle school places were reduced due to the changing needs of society and the desires of parents. In the autumn of 1980, Tak Nga became entirely an English Secondary School. Class structure The school has four classes from S1 (Secondary One) to S3 (Secondary Three), each form consisting of 160 students; four classes in S4 to S5, each form consisting 160 students having 1 Science classes, 1 Arts and 2 Arts and Commerce classes; two classes in Form 6 and 7, each form 1 science class consisting 28 students and 1 Arts class consisting 32 students. Curriculum The school uses English as the medium of instruction. The policy is implemented through tri-lingual assemblies, English and Chinese extensive reading schemes, activities in English Corner, Society of Eloquence, English Week and Putonghua Club.

KNWB and sister station KMWB form a simulcast to reach all of the Big Island. History=KFSH= On May 3, 1976, the Christian Broadcasting Association, a branch of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and owner of KAIM-AM-FM in Honolulu, filed for a construction permit for a new radio station at 97.1 MHz to serve Hilo. The Federal Communications Commission granted the permit on April 28, 1977. The station took the call letters KFSH and was mentioned as a development project for the ministry in KAIM's fundraising appeals. However, KFSH's sign-on was continually delayed, in part because the station needed the Hawaii Land Use Commission to approve its request to build its tower. Even though a studio location had been secured and fitted out upstairs from a Christian book store, tower site issues continued to hold up completion. The tower site north of Kaiwiki Church was dedicated on December 15, 1984, and test transmissions commenced on July 25, 1985 ahead of an August 3 launch, more than eight years after the permit was issued and after 17 extensions and modifications to the construction permit. Two years after putting KFSH on the air, the Christian Broadcasting Association spun the station off to the Pacific & Asia Christian University, later known as the University of the Nations. =KNWB= In July 1995, New West Broadcasting Corporation, owned by John Leonard, announced it would buy KFSH from the university and take over operations via a time brokerage agreement on August 1. Leonard paid $270,000 for the station, which was University of the Nations' lone broadcast outlet. New West, which already owned KWXX and KPUA, did not buy $60,000 in KFSH studio equipment, which allowed the university to donate it to Hilo Christian Broadcasting; that group then started up KCIF. When New West took over, 97.1 FM changed to a secular operation as \\"The Wave\\"; after the closing of the sale, new KNWB call letters were chosen. The Wave aired a smooth jazz format. Two years later, the station adopted its present classic hits format as \\"B97\\". KNWB lured D.C. Carlson from KKBG to do B97's first live morning show in December 2001; previously, the station had been entirely voice tracked. B97 became an island-wide radio station in 2007 when Captain Cook Broadcasting, the winner of an auction for an FM station at 93.1 in West Hawaii, entered into a marketing agreement to simulcast KNWB as KMWB. KMWB was sold to New West in 2010.

Winkless in his directorial debut, produced by Julie Corman, and starring Robert King, and stars Robert Lansing, Lisa Langlois, Franc Luz, and Terri Treas. It is based on Eli Cantor's 1980 novel of the same name published under the pseudonym Gregory A. Douglas, and written by Robert King. The plot concerns a New England fishing village which is attacked by mutated cockroaches, as a result of an experiment gone wrong. Plot The sheriff of this small island town called North Port has a roach problem in his house. According to the local exterminator Homer (played by Stephen Davies), it turns out the whole town is about to have a big roach problem. Pets, and then people, begin to disappear or turn up dead and mutilated. Although Sheriff Richard Tarbell (played by Frank Luz) is dating Lillian, the owner of the local eatery, his high school sweetheart Elizabeth Johnson returns to the island after a four-year absence and their romance blooms again. Elizabeth (played by Lisa Langlois) happens to be the daughter of the town's mayor, Elias Johnson (played by Robert Lansing), who is in cahoots with an evil corporation called INTEC that has been secretly breeding mutant roaches that are immune to normal insect repellants. They also seem to have the ability to assume the form of anything they kill, leading to some animal/roach hybrids and even 2 roach/human combos. Production The filmmakers utilized 2,000 flying cockroaches during filming at Quicksilver Studios in Venice, Los Angeles. When some of the insects escaped into nearby dressing rooms, the American Humane Association were unable to assist them as the organization must be contacted prior to shooting on matters concerning insects. Release=Critical response= The film received a mixed response from film critics. Candice Russell of the Sun-Sentinel wrote: \\"Fulfilling the promise of The Hellstrom Chronicle, The Nest is a roach rout. It's no masterpiece, but in the last 40 minutes, fans of the genre get their money's worth.\\" Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Leonard Klady praised Winkless' direction and King's screenplay, noting that the film \\"hatches its clever plot extremely successfully.\\" Ed Bank of The Pittsburgh Press awarded the film a one-and-a- half star, criticizing its storyline as being \\"too familiar.\\" The New York Daily News deemed the film \\"broke little in the way of new bug-movie ground.\\" =Home video= The Nest was first released on VHS by MGM/UA Home Video in 1989. It was released on DVD for the first time by New Concorde Home Entertainment on August 28, 2001, now out of print. Scream Factory, a subsidiary of Shout! Factory, released the film on Blu-ray and DVD as a combo pack on February 19, 2013.

Veenker served as Iowa State's head football coach for six seasons, from 1931 until 1936. He also served as the school's athletic director from 1933 to 1945. When Veenker joined Iowa State, the school's football team was coming off a winless season in 1930 and had lost 16 consecutive games dating back to October 1929. Veenker was credited with turning the Iowa State football program into a success. In his first year, the 1931 team defeated Missouri (20–0), Oklahoma (13–12), and Kansas State (7–6), compiled a 5–3 record and finished in second place in the Big Six Conference. In November 1931, the Ames Daily Tribune-Times called Veenker \\"a veritable miracle man of football\\" for taking a school where \\"Cyclone football morale couldn't have been lower\\" and turning the program around in his first season. The highlight of Veenker's career as Iowa State's football coach was a 31–6 victory over the Iowa Hawkeyes in 1934. The game was the last meeting between the two schools for many years. After the victory over Iowa, one sports writer noted, \\"George Veenker deserves high praise. He went to Ames from Michigan to find a campus whose interest in football had all but died. In a few seasons what wonder George Veenker has wrought!\\" On November 30, 1936, Veenker announced his resignation as the school's head football coach. As athletic director, he appointed his assistant, James J. Yeager, as the school's new head football coach. Veenker's overall record as the head football coach at Iowa State was 21 wins, 22 losses, and 8 ties.Iowa State Coaching Records In his 12 years as Iowa State's athletic director, Veenker led the effort to construct a golf course on the northern edge of the Iowa State campus and hired golf course architect Perry Maxwell to design the course. The golf course was completed in 1938. As athletic director, Veenker also supported the school's basketball teams led by coach Louis Menze. The Iowa State basketball team won multiple conference championships under Menze while Veenker was the athletic director. Veenker was a member of the NCAA Football Rules Committee from 1938 to 1945. He was a member of the Rules Committee in 1941 when it instituted the free substitution rule due to a severe loss of manpower to the war effort. Veenker supported the rule, noting that smaller colleges not represented on the Rules Committee needed substitution help more than the major schools. The rule adopted in 1941 marked the beginning of the end for \\"iron man\\" football in which players remained in the game on both offense and defense due to rules limiting substitutions.Nelson, The Anatomy of a Game, p. 218. Veenker was also appointed as a professor of physical education at Iowa State in 1933 and became the \\"head of the Physical Education Department for Men.\\" In June 1945, Veenker resigned from his position as Iowa State's athletic director, effective July 1, 1945. When he announced his retirement, the Ames Daily Tribune credited Veenker with expanding the campus recreation area from to , improving the athletic department's financial condition, and developing the quality of the athletic teams \\"to the point that championships have been coming regularly.\\" Later years and death After retiring from his post at Iowa State, Veenker moved to a small acreage farm near Ames, Iowa. He subsequently moved to Arkansas. In his later years, Veenker lived in Malta, Illinois, which was the hometown of his wife. He died of cancer in September 1959 at age 65. The golf course on the Iowa State campus was renamed Veenker Memorial Golf Course shortly after his death. Veenker was survived by his wife; they had no children. Veenker was posthumously inducted into the Iowa State Athletics Hall of Fame in 2007.

Converted to Douglas C-47 Skytrains in early 1942, trained under I Troop Carrier Command for combat operations. Assigned to Twelfth Air Force and deployed North Africa during May 1943. The squadron's aircraft flew supplies to front-line units in Algeria and Tunisia during the North African Campaign as soon as suitable landing strips were available and evacuated casualties back to rear area field hospitals. Squadron engaged in combat operations, dropping airborne units into Sicily during Operation Husky and later into areas around Anzio, Italy as part of Operation Shingle, the invasion of mainland Italy and the initiation of the Italian Campaign, January 1944. Moved north though Italy, in 1943 in support of Allied ground forces, evacuated wounded personnel and flew missions behind enemy lines in Italy and the Balkans to haul guns, ammunition, food, clothing, medical supplies, and other materials to the partisans and to drop propaganda leaflets. Moved to England in February 1944, assigned to IX Troop Carrier Command. Prepared for the invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe. In June 1944, subordinate units dropped paratroops in Normandy, subsequently flying numerous missions to bring in reinforcements and needed supplies. During the airborne attack on The Netherlands (Operation Market Garden, September 1944), the squadron dropped paratroops, towed gliders, and flew resupply missions. Several of its subordinate units also participated in the invasion of southern France in August 1944. The 50th supported the 101st Airborne Division in the Battle of the Bulge by towing gliders full of supplies near Bastogne on 27 December 1944. When the Allies made the air assault across the Rhine River in March 1945, each aircraft towed two gliders with troops of the 17th Airborne Division and released them near Wesel. The squadron also hauled food, clothing, medicine, gasoline, ordnance equipment, and other supplies to the front lines and evacuated patients to rear zone hospitals. In late May 1945, after V-E Day, the squadron was moved to Waller Field, Trinidad and attached to Air Transport Command. From Trinidad, the squadron ferried returning military personnel to Morrison Field, Florida, where they were sent on to other bases or prepared for separation after the war. =Berlin Airlift= During the Cold War the 14th was involved in the Berlin Airlift from 1948 to 1949. =Korean War= Conducted aerial transport from the U.S. to Japan, August – December 1950, and between Japan and Korea, 16 November 1951 – 1 December 1952. =Strategic airlift= Conducted worldwide airlift since 1953, including to Southeast Asia from 1966 to 1973 and supporting military operations in Grenada, October–November 1983, Panama, 18 December 1989 – 8 January 1990, and to Southwest Asia, August 1990 – January 1991. = Operations and Decorations = * Combat Operations.

It was also released as a single as the B-side of \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\". Dylan plays the song solo, accompanying himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica. It is considered one of Dylan's most surreal songs. In a 2005 Mojo magazine poll of its writers and various well-known musicians, \\"Gates of Eden\\" was ranked 76th among Dylan's 100 greatest songs. Writing and recording According to Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin, \\"Gates of Eden\\" was written in late June or July 1964. Based on the clean draft of the song, Heylin believes that Dylan did not need to struggle as much writing this song as he did with \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" and \\"Chimes of Freedom\\", which were written a short time earlier. In the draft, eight of the song's nine verses are complete and only two lines were revised for the final version. The final verse in the draft is incomplete, consisting of just two lines: The song was recorded in a single take on January 15, 1965, the same day as the other songs of side 2 of Bringing It All back Home--\\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\", \\"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" and \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\"--were recorded. Tom Wilson was the producer. Lyrics and imagery The song's dream imagery is reminiscent of William Blake's images in \\"The Gates of Paradise\\" and \\"The Keys of the Gates\\". The abstract poetry inspires a nightmarish vision. Each verse provides a separate description of a decaying society. Although the song's title seems to provide hope of paradise, there is no paradise in the place this song describes. Rather, the imagery evokes corruption and decay. Dylan's ominous delivery of the last line of each verse followed by a sour harmonica note emphasizes that this Eden cannot be reached. Oliver Trager interprets \\"Gates of Eden\\" as Dylan's declaration that \\"blind belief in a forgiving afterlife is the ultimate lie because it creates complacency in this one.\\" Music critic Robert Shelton has a similar interpretation, that \\"belief in life after death without worry or care is the ultimate myth because it takes us past the ugliness in life.\\" Carolyn Bliss has noted about the song that \\"Eden is inside. Any other paradise is a sham, and pursuit of it potentially deadly to the spirit.\\" The lyrics describe others besides the narrator who are searching for truth in this false paradise. But the experiences that the characters endure are rendered meaningless at the end of each verse by the inevitable specter of the Gates of Eden. In the first verse, a cowboy angel riding on the clouds searches for the sun using a black wax candle. In the second verse, the cry of babies longing for the silence of Eden is shrouded by the industrialized city and its metallic objects. In the third verse, a savage soldier sticks his head in the sand like an ostrich and waits with a deaf hunter for the mythical ship to Eden. In the fourth verse, Aladdin with his magic lamp and monks riding on the Golden Calf promise paradise, and listeners only laugh at the promise once they actually get to Eden. The fifth verse describes Marxists philosophizing and waiting for kings to succeed each other, while their intended audience ignores them, knowing that there are no kings in Eden. In verse six, a motorcycle hipster torments his opposite, a midget businessman, as vultures look on. Although both the hipster and the businessman are concerned with sin, there are no sins in death or in Eden. The seventh verse tells us that Blakean \\"kingdoms of Experience\\" eventually rot, poor people battle each other over their meager possessions and the nobility just babbles on, but none of it matters in Eden. In the eighth verse, people attempt to change their fates, but it is all futile once they get to Eden. In the final verse, the narrator's lover tells him of her dreams, but the narrator realizes that his dream of death is the only truthful one, perhaps taking an example from the lover who tells rather than tries to interpret her dream: Concert performances A live version of \\"Gates of Eden\\", recorded at its debut performance at Philharmonic Hall on October 31, 1964, was released on The Bootleg Series Vol. 6: Bob Dylan Live 1964, Concert at Philharmonic Hall. In his introduction to the song at this performance, Dylan described the song as a \\"sacrilegious lullaby in D minor\\" and as a \\"love song\\". A recording of Dylan's May 7, 1965 performance of \\"Gates of Eden\\" in Manchester, England is included on Live 1962-1966: Rare Performances From The Copyright Collections (2018), while a performance of the song from his May 9, 1965 concert in London was featured in the 1967 film Dont Look Back. During his Never Ending Tour, Dylan introduced an interpretation with a heavy metal edge for a brief period early in the tour and then returned the song to the setlist in 1995 with Django Reinhardt-like performances. Cover versions Julie Felix covered the song in 1967 on Flowers, and Arlo Guthrie covered the song in 1973, on the Last of the Brooklyn Cowboys. Others who have covered the song include Ralph McTell, Woody Lissauer, The Myddle Class and Bryan Ferry, Dylan sang it with Neil Young on the 1992 album San Francisco Bay Blues.

A white sand beach resort on the island, a family-run business, is a popular destination for both local and foreign tourists.  Etymology  The term Lakawon is derived from a Cebuano word lakaw, meaning \\"to walk\\". The island may have gotten its name because during low tide, one has to literally walk or wade a long distance to or from the main island.  Features  Lakawon is north of Bacolod, the provincial capital. The island is accessible from the coast of Barangay Cadiz Viejo via a 20-minute boat ride. Lakawon's white sand beach is claimed to rival that of Boracay, a popular island resort off the coast of Aklan in Panay. In stark contrast to its more famous counterpart, however, Lakawon has a smaller influx of tourists, and the island is not commercially developed. The island is more akin to a sandbar. The white sand beaches are largely on the part of the island facing the island of Negros. The opposite portion, facing the open sea, is more rugged. There is a small fishing village on one side of the island. The inhabitants there earn their living from harvesting the sea's bounty. As a destination Cadiz Viejo, which is the nearest mainland point to the island, may be accessed via private or public transportation. From Bacolod City, or any point of Negros, jeepney drivers are available for hire. One may also take Ceres Liner buses from any of the cities and municipalities in the province. From the national highway in Cadiz Viejo, a dirt road leads to the shore. The island is visible from here and parking space is available. The ride to the island by motorized banca takes about 20 minutes. It is best to arrive in the morning during high tide-the waters will be calmer and there will be less wading required to get to the boat. Typhoon Haiyan Residents of Lakawon Island in Cadiz City said that of the ~280 houses in the island, only about 10 were left intact after Typhoon Haiyan (named Yolanda in the Philippines) hit in November 2013.

She was born in Kongsberg as a daughter of customs officer Gustavus Blom and his wife Karen Petronelle Stoltenberg. According to Norsk biografisk leksikon her name was Susanne Sophie Catharina Gustava and not Susanne Sophie Caroline Gustava, as many believe. In May 1824 in Drammen she married the minister Gabriel Kirsebom Kielland (1796-1854). Her husband was also a first cousin once removed of Gabriel Schanche Kielland and second cousin of Jacob Kielland. She spent most of her life in the parishes of Finnøy and Lyngdal, where her husband was stationed as vicar. She was influenced by the Moravian Church, but did not become involved in missionary activity until 1840. Following a missionary lecture in Stavanger, she regretted her \\"lukewarm\\" attitude to mission. Then, back in Lyngdal, she formed a Christian-social women's association consisting of herself, three farmer's wives and one farmer's daughter. With the foundation date 13 November 1840, this is considered the country's first women's association. Her association soon expanded, spreading to Austad and Kvås. Today she is best known for her literary output. Several of the songs she wrote are still well known, in particular the Christmas carol \\"O, Jul med din Glæde\\", and the children's song \\"Liden Ekorn\\". Late in her life, she dictated her memoirs Erindringer fra mitt liv (Reminiscence from my Life), printed in manuscript form for her family in 1882. In 1899 an edited version was released for a wider audience. The book was one of the first autobiographies written by a woman in Norway. She had four sons and four daughters. She suffered from blindness between age 73 and 78, but regained eyesight after an operation. She died in February 1889 in Skien, at the time living with one of her daughters and her son-in-law Andreas Hauge. She was also the paternal grandmother of engineer Nils Vogt Kielland and writer Eugenia Marie Kielland.

The station, established in 1936 as \\"KHBC\\", has been owned and operated by New West Broadcasting Corporation since 1992. KPUA broadcasts a variety of local and syndicated talk radio programming, including some specialty Japanese language programs. Programming KPUA broadcasts a news/talk/sports radio format to the Hilo area. , syndicated programming on the station includes Wall Street Journal This Morning hosted by Gordon Deal and Gina Cervetti (Wall Street Journal Radio Network), First Light hosted by Dirk Van (Dial Global), Coast to Coast AM hosted by George Noory (Premiere Networks), and America in the Morning with Jim Bohannon (Dial Global), plus programming blocks from Yahoo! Sports Radio and CBS Radio News. Local weekday programming includes Japanese Show with Taka. History=KHBC era= On May 1, 1936, Honolulu Broadcasting Company, Ltd., established a new radio station to serve Hilo, Hawaii, with 250 watts of power on a medium wave frequency of 1400 kilohertz (kHz). This station was assigned the call sign \\"KHBC\\" (for Honolulu Broadcasting Company) by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC). By 1940, the station had been acquired by the Hawaiian Broadcasting System, Ltd., and shifted to 1200 kHz while maintaining the 250 watt signal. KHBC was one of several broadcast stations owned by the Honolulu Star-Bulletin as part of the Hawaiian Broadcasting System stations group. On March 29, 1941, the signal was relocated to 1230 kHz, still at 250 watts, as part of a mass realignment of radio stations due to the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement. During this time, the station was an affiliate of the CBS Radio Network. In 1948, KHBC was granted a new construction permit to shift to 970 kHz and to increase its power output to 1,000 watts. The station began licensed operation at the new parameters in 1949. =KPUA era= In 1965, the Honolulu Star-Bulletin reached a deal to sell most of its stations to the A.L. Glassmann stations group but sold KHBC separately to the Pacific Broadcasting Corporation, owned by Cecil \\"Cec\\" Heftel. The deal was consummated on June 7, 1965. The new owners had the FCC assign the \\"KPUA\\" call sign to the station in late 1965. The station was an affiliate of the CBS Radio Network. In 1969, the station received FCC authorization to increase broadcast power from 1,000 to 5,000 watts. =1970s= By the mid-1970s, the station's format was middle of the road music and KPUA was an affiliate of both the ABC Radio Network and the Coconut Wireless Network. In 1975 as Cecil Heftel was planning his (ultimately successful) campaign for the United States House of Representatives from Hawaii's 1st congressional district, Pacific Broadcasting agreed to sell KPUA to the Aloha Broadcasting Company. The deal gained FCC approval and formal consummation of the transaction took place on January 1, 1976. The station maintained the MOR format and network affiliation under the new ownership. In January 1979, Aloha Broadcasting contracted to sell KPUA to Hawaii Broadcasting Company, Inc. The deal gained FCC approval on May 1, 1979, and the transaction was consummated on May 3, 1979. =1980s= In August 1981, KPUA's new owners applied to the FCC for a new construction permit to allow the station to change frequencies from 970 to 670 kHz, change its transmitter site, and increase power to 10,000 watts. The FCC granted this permit on July 8, 1983, with a scheduled expiration date on July 8, 1984. After several amendments and renewals, construction and testing were completed in August 1985. KPUA began licensed broadcasting on the 670 kHz frequency on December 20, 1985. In May 1989, Hawaii Broadcasting Company reached a deal to transfer the KPUA broadcast license to Hawaii Radio, Inc. The FCC approved the move on July 12, 1989, and the transaction was consummated on August 22, 1989. =1990s= Following a November 1989 application, the FCC granted KPUA's new owners a construction permit to increase the station's power to 50,000 watts, day and night, and make related changes to their antenna system. The permit was issued on December 31, 1990, with a scheduled expiration date on June 30, 1992. However, before the construction could be completed, Hawaii Radio, Inc., encountered financial difficulties and in March 1992 the station's assets and broadcast license were involuntarily assigned to Wyman Lai, acting as bankruptcy trustee. By the end of March, trustee Lai had arranged to sell KPUA to New West Broadcasting Corporation. The FCC approved the sale on May 18, 1992, and formal consummation of the deal occurred on July 16, 1992. =2000s= In January 2003, the station launched its KPUA.net website as a news portal, mixing local stories by its news staff with regional, national, and international news from the Associated Press. In 2004, the station requested and received special temporary authority to operate at a reduced power of just 5,000 watts, citing engineering issues with the station's transmitter. These requests were repeated in 2007 and 2008. In September 2008, KPUA requested a new construction permit to allow permanent operation at this 5,000 watt level. The FCC granted this permit on February 18, 2009, with a scheduled expiration of February 18, 2012. KPUA received a new license to cover this change on January 19, 2010. On March 5, 2012, KPUA made international headlines when it canceled The Rush Limbaugh Show after Limbaugh came under fire for calling law student Sandra Fluke a \\"slut\\" and a \\"prostitute.\\" KPUA is believed to be the first of only two affiliates to cancel the show over the controversy (the other being WBEC in Massachusetts; for perspective, Limbaugh has approximately 600 affiliates across the United States). Station manager Chris Leonard told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that \\"decency and responsibility\\" demanded that his station sever its ties with Limbaugh. Former staff Shinobu Sato hosted a one-hour weekday morning Japanese language program called Echoes of Japan. Her long career at KHBC/KPUA led the station's general manager, asked when Sato started hosting, to tell the Honolulu Star-Bulletin in December 2001, \\"We've never been able to figure it out exactly. It's close to 50 years.\\" Sato retired from KPUA in May 2002 after 43 years on the air. The Japanese Community Association of Hawaii named Sato a \\"cultural treasure\\" in 2003 for her \\"significant contributions to the preservation and perpetuating of the Japanese culture and arts\\", In addition to her extended radio career, Sato had worked as a state papaya inspector and cosmetics sales agent. Born in Papa'ikou, Hawai'i, she died on October 17, 2008, at the age of 98.

Location The Sheraton on the Falls is situated directly across from Niagara Falls in the heart of the tourist district. The Sheraton is the cornerstone of Falls Avenue Resort which includes an indoor walkway from the hotel to attractions and dining options on complex that include the Fallsview Indoor Waterpark, Hershey Store, Rainforest Cafe, Hard Rock Cafe, Adventure City, Crowne Plaza Niagara Falls-Fallsview and Skyline Inn. History The Sheraton site has housed guests visiting Niagara Falls for more than 100 years. The first hotel at this location on Clifton Hill, The Parkside Inn, was built in the early 1890s. It was a three-story building with an observatory. The grounds were well kept and amenities included hot & cold running water, electricity, and gas. In later years, the Parkside was enlarged by incorporating two adjacent buildings into the original structure. From 1914 to 1921, the Parkside was used as a wing of the adjacent Clifton Hotel, which later burned down in 1932. In 1923, Howard Fox purchased the hotel and changed its name to The Clifton Inn which was later shortened to The Inn. It became The Foxhead in 1926 after being remodeled into a fake old English Inn. The Sheraton chain bought the hotel in 1951. The hotel closed in 1958 and reopened the following year after the western end was converted into Tussaud's Waxworks, which still stands today. The rest of the building was demolished in 1964 and the brand new Sheraton-Foxhead Motor Inn opened on the site in 1966. The Sheraton-Foxhead was among three hotels located within the Maple Leaf Village Amusement park along with sister hotels the Brock-Sheraton, and Sheraton Motor Inn (Skyline Inn). After the amusement park's demise the 14-storey hotel had extensive renovations. In 2000, the building was gutted and had eight stories added on top, reemerging as the 22-storey 4-Diamond Sheraton on the Falls Hotel.

It provides education from class three (Grade-3) to class ten (Grade-10). It was a private English medium school before becoming a public school. History Bogra Zilla School was established in 1853. Babu Bhagabati Charan Ghosh was the first headmaster. It was a private (non-government) school before becoming a public one. It came under governmental management through the efforts of then magistrate and collector Mr. Russell and deputy collector Babu S. Mukharjee.Bangladesh directory This school observed its 150th anniversary celebration in 2005. Bogra Zilla School was the second government high school in the Bogra district during British rule. Babu Bhagabati Charan Ghosh was appointed Headmaster of the school and held the post for six years. Bogra's native son Babu Kishoree Lal Roy, who is the author of many philosophical writings, was an early student of this school. In his book Free Enquiry after Truth he wrote, “In 1853 a Government English school was established here and I obtained my entrance into it. My progress in this institution has been remarked by its first and best of its Headmasters that ever were, to have been remarkably rapid. Be it said with deep respect and gratitude that under the judicious tuition of Babu Bhagabati Charan Ghosh I obtained a useful knowledge of the English language within about four years and a half. I have always thought Bhahabati Babu to be one of my greatest benefactors on Earth and will think so for ever also.” There were four teachers during the period of Bhagabati Babu. According to the National School Committee, the school appears to have beeb founded principally by the sons and relatives of the clerks' officers connected with the Courts. After Bhagabati Babu, A. C. Mukharjee became Headmaster in 1859. During his tenure, two students passed in 2nd division, and one passed in 1st division with scholarship in 1862. Around this time, the practice of giving books as rewards to the students of both Bangla and English schools based on their performance was started. During the prize- giving ceremony more than a hundred taka used to be spent for fireworks. During 1859–60, the inspector of the schools of the north-east areas and Assam, Mr. W. Robinson, conducted the ceremony. He arranged a demonstration with a magic lantern for their entertainment and showed many interesting and educative events of nature such as the motions of the stars and planets, a solar and lunar eclipse, a cyclone, etc. From 1881 to 1885, a school building was constructed of bricks. In 1873–74, there were six teachers, one pundit, and one moulavi in the school. There were 85 students in 1860–61. In 1907–08, the number of students was 363. Among them, 218 were Hindus and 145 were Muslims. The school now has 52 faculty members and 2000 students. The faculty members are graduates from universities in Bangladesh, and student applicants, mostly from top elementary schools, are put through a competitive admission selection process. Location Bogra Zilla School is located at the center of Bogra city, called Shatmatha. It is the nerve of Bogra town. The Circuit House is situated at the eastern border of the school and a playing ground, named Altafunnesa is situated in the southern border. Admission Admission is competitive. Students are admitted into class three. After an initial screening, more than 2500 applicants appear at a comprehensive admission test for only 240 positions. There are a few positions (five to ten) in class four to nine each year. Bogra Zilla School is one of the best Schools of Bogra Town and Bangladesh also. Academics This school teaches from class three to class ten. Upon a screening in class ten, students appear at the SSC examination.

It serves the residents of Dubuque and its surrounding tri-state area which includes 12 counties in Iowa, Illinois and Wisconsin. Under Music Director William Intriligator, over 75 professional musicians perform a repertoire of classical, chamber, opera and pops concerts each year. The DSO performs an average of 12 different concerts a year with a total of 25 performances.  History  Although its antecedents may be traced as far back as 1903, the Dubuque Symphony Orchestra, as currently structured, was organized in 1958 as the “University Civic Symphony” under the auspices of the University of Dubuque. The name was changed to the Dubuque Symphony Orchestra in 1974 to reflect the organization's mission to serve the entire community. More than 40 years ago, the orchestra presented five concerts yearly under the baton of founding Music Director and Conductor Dr. Parviz Mahmoud. Dr. Mahmoud had been conductor of the Tehran Symphony and head of the Iranian Administrators of Music and Iranian Radio Broadcasts. He earned his Master of Music degree in composition and a Ph.D. in theory at the prestigious School of Music at Northwestern University. Under his directorship, the DSO grew in size and prestige through Dr. Mahmoud's retirement in 1985. In that year, Nicholas Palmer was selected as the DSO's second Music Director and Conductor. Under Maestro Palmer's direction, the orchestra continued to grow steadily in size, ticket sales and public support. The number of concerts performed increased from five in the 1985–1986 season to 27 in the 1991–1992 season. Maestro Palmer was named Conductor Emeritus of the Dubuque Symphony Orchestra in 1999 in recognition of his service to the orchestra. During the 1999–2000 season the DSO conducted a nationwide search to fill Maestro Palmer's position. The Board of Directors together with the patrons of the DSO, overwhelmingly chose William Intriligator to be the third Music Director and Conductor of the Dubuque Symphony Orchestra. Under Maestro Intriligator's leadership the DSO has experienced tremendous growth and success—attracting new audiences and musicians, adding opera productions to the season, launching a chamber series, doubling the number of education concerts and forging new partnerships in the community. Around the same time, the DSO realized change was needed in its staff and Board. The staff added several new positions, Director of Marketing, Director of Development, and bookkeeper. For its top administrative executive, the Board sought and engaged new Executive Directors with experience and expertise. In 1969 the Dubuque Symphony Orchestra organized the Dubuque Youth Symphony Orchestra (DYSO). The goal of the Youth Symphony was to assist in the development of young musicians who could eventually graduate to the DSO. The DYSO consists of 50 of the area's best student musicians from as far away as Prairie du Chien, WI. In 1993 the program was expanded to include the Dubuque Youth String Ensemble (DYSE), a smaller training ensemble for less experienced string players. The Dubuque Symphony Orchestra Auxiliary was formed in 1966 to assist with the financial support of the symphony. The name was changed to the Dubuque Symphony Orchestra League (DSOL) in 1986. The League sponsors events throughout the year to raise funds for the DSO and to provide educational opportunities for tri-state area residents. Currently the League has over 120 members. Music directors * William Intriligator (2000–) * Nicholas Palmer (1985–1999) * Parviz Mahmoud (1957–1985)  Musicians  The DSO employs approximately 60 professional musicians on a yearly contract while the rest of the orchestra consists of substitute players. Roughly one-fifth of the contract musicians are local while the remainder travel from larger metropolitan areas like Chicago, Madison, Milwaukee, Des Moines, Iowa City and the Quad Cities. Orchestra musicians audition behind a screen so that their identity is unknown to the judges, and the only consideration in their appointment to the orchestra is their musical ability. Musicians have only about 3 weeks before the concert to study and rehearse the music, then rehearse together for just 10½ hours before each concert. Youth ensembles The DSO sponsors two different youth orchestra training programs for young instrumentalists, the [Dubuque Youth Symphony Orchestra] (DYSO) and the Dubuque Youth String Ensemble (DYSE). Students audition annually to become members. =Dubuque Youth String Ensemble= The Dubuque Youth String Ensemble (DYSE) is an introductory honors ensemble for young string players. The ensemble focuses on developing string technique, ensemble skills, and gaining performance experience. Musicians participating in the DYSE will focus on chamber orchestra music as a tool to develop advanced string technique and ensemble skills. Musicians performing in the Dubuque Youth String Orchestra generally have 3–4 years of playing experience. =Dubuque Youth Symphony Orchestra= The Dubuque Youth Symphony (DYSO) was founded in 1968 as a feeder ensemble for the Dubuque Symphony Orchestra. Today the ensemble exists as an honors youth orchestra for students living in the Dubuque area.

History The history of the Model 76 submachine gun started in April of 1966 with a call from Smith & Wesson's Washington, D.C. sales representative; he had been contacted by the US Navy Department to see if Smith & Wesson would be interested in designing and producing a 9mm submachine gun. The US Navy had the need for a submachine gun for their SEAL special operations team in Vietnam. The SEALs' weapon of choice was the Swedish Carl Gustaf m/45―a well-made and reliable submachine gun. Because Sweden was a neutral country, a problem arose; they objected to their product being used in a war zone. Therefore, the supply of the Carl Gustaf m/45 to the US Navy was cut off, which meant they had to find another submachine gun to take its place. Although they appear similar, the M76 was designed from scratch from a list of requirements, which the US Navy SEALs provided, they are: * Urgent need; * Reliability; * Rugged; * Selective Fire: safe—semi- automatic—full automatic; * Cost effective; * Ease of maintenance: disassembly—cleaning―reassembly * Magazine capacity of 36 rounds; and * Cyclic rate between 600 and 800 rounds per minute preferred. It was from this list that the M76 was created. According to the Director of Research and Development and head of the Model 76 project at the time, Dwayne W. Charron, was quoted as saying, \\"[He] had never seen, held or fired a Swedish K before starting design work on the M76...\\".The M76 fires 9mm rounds; the Carl Gustaf m/45 has an open bolt design and also fires 9×19mm Parabellum ammunition. The SEALs also requested a limited number of suppressors for the M76. These suppressors were to be used under certain situations to reduce the gun's sound and hide the flash so there would be no point of reference for return fire. Being an open bolt system, some sound would always be emitted, but the muzzle flash could be eliminated. Due to the ongoing war and a critical need to fill, Smith & Wesson designated the M76 a top priority project. The total time to take the concept of the M76 from the drawing board to production was just nine months. Many people comment that the gun is ugly or rough. Due to the urgency at the time, the M76 skipped the finishing department where welds and rough edges would normally be smoothed. Due to lack of market demand, Smith & Wesson ceased production of the M76 in 1974. Variants=MK760= In 1983, Mike Ruplinger and Kenneth Dominick started a company called MK Arms and acquired the rights to the Smith & Wesson M76. They began producing copies of it with the designation MK Arms MK760, and the US Navy, which still had some original M76s in its inventory, began purchasing replacement parts from MK Arms. MK Arms also produced carbine and pistol configurations of the MK760. In 1986, due to the Firearm Owners Protection Act, which banned any newly manufactured automatic weapons from being registered for civilian ownership, MK Arms went out of business. =M76A1= In 1984, Dominick separated from Ruplinger and began producing his own copy of the M76 under the trade name Global Arms with a designation of M76A1. =SW 76= The SW 76 was manufactured by JMB Distribution in Ohio from virgin tubes that were originally registered by John Stemple in 1986. All of the parts of the SW 76 will interchange with an original Smith & Wesson M76 except for the bolt. The bolt is not interchangeable due to the reorientation of the extractor and the Stemple receiver tubes have an inside diameter that is slightly larger than that of an original S&W; M76, requiring two sleeves that act as bearing surfaces to be placed on the bolt to take up the extra space inside the receiver. =Omega 760 Carbine= During 2001 the Tactical Weapons Company of Arizona was engaged to manufacture the parts and receivers for a weapon that would be marketed as the Omega 760 carbine, a semiautomatic-only copy of the Smith & Wesson Model 76. Initial sales of the Omega 760 were brisk but quickly dropped off. The disappointing sales of the Omega ultimately drove the decision to cease production and the decision left a number of parts that were never assembled into guns.

The location still serves as an accessible MBTA Commuter Rail stop and park-and-ride location for Swampscott and adjoining Marblehead. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998 as Swampscott Railroad Depot. History Swampscott station around 1900 The existing station building was originally built in 1868 for the Eastern Railroad; it was designed by George W. Cram, a Boston housewright. The depot was renovated by a group of locals in the 1980s to save it from demolition, but the work was temporary. In 1997, a town committee raised $15,000 to restore the exterior to its original condition, but no interior work was done. On August 28, 1998 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2005, the town attempted to sell the station to a developer, but negotiations stalled in 2006. In 2010, the town again began soliciting proposals for reuse; however, the station has not received proper interior renovations, making reuse difficult. A December 2012 town report advocated for mixed-use development at the station, as well as a pedestrian crossing between the platforms. In 2012, Swampscott Station was signed as \\"Stanton Station\\" for use in the 2013 film Grown Ups 2. =Rail trail= In 2004, a town report proposed various transportation improvements, including improving pedestrian and bicycle access to the station from other areas in the town. This included the construction of a mixed-use path on the former Swampscott Branch right-of-way. Service on the Swampscott Branch, which diverged just north of the station, was discontinued in 1959 as the Boston & Maine Railroad shed unprofitable branch lines. The northern section in Marblehead was previously converted to part of the Marblehead Rail Trail, which runs along the former Marblehead Branch to South Salem. In 2012, the town drafted an eminent domain claim to obtain part of the right-of-way near the station from National Grid, who was not opposed to the trail but had much stricter requirements to allow conversion.

It was developed by Hothead Games and published by Electronic Arts. The game was released on July 13, 2010 on the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network and on July 14, 2010 on the Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade. The Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X versions were released October 26, 2010 and December 14, 2010 respectively, via Steam. DeathSpank follows the titular character DeathSpank in his quest to find an item known as The Artifact. The game was originally supposed to be the first of a two-part series. The second half of the series, entitled DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue was first released on September 20, 2010. Gilbert described DeathSpank as being \\"Act I\\" in the story, and Thongs of Virtue as being \\"Acts II and III\\". However, it was later announced that Deathspank was returning for a third game entitled, The Baconing, abandoning the protagonist's name in its title. The third game was released on August 30, 2011. DeathSpank has received generally positive reviews from critics, who cited influences from both the Monkey Island and Diablo games. Gameplay 2D and 3D objects. DeathSpank is an action role- playing game which also features elements from graphic adventure games. Combat gameplay is similar to Diablo. Players can acquire several pieces of armor and weaponry, each with different abilities and attributes. During combat players can chain attacks in combos, which in turn deal more damage with each hit. As more hits are gained on enemies, DeathSpank's Justice Meter will fill. Once full, the player can unleash more powerful attacks for a limited time. In-game conversations with non-player characters are also a large part of the game. DeathSpank features advanced dialog options, similar to LucasArts' Monkey Island series which play a large part in unfolding the game's story. These conversations may lead to quests for DeathSpank. In all, the game features 79 side quests in addition to the 33 quests required to advance the main plot. Once the game is completed the player can return and complete any unfinished side quests. DeathSpank is designed to be playable in short segments, and has three difficulty levels. It contains about 8 to 12 hours of gameplay depending on choices made by the player during the game. The world of DeathSpank is presented as a rotating cylinder, with the display having a rounded element, similar to Animal Crossing: Wild World. The world is a mixture of 2D and 3D props on 3D terrain, and is rendered without load screens as the player moves between areas. The game also features a local cooperative mode, in which the second player takes the role of Sparkles the Wizard. Sparkles is equipped with multiple spells which provide support to DeathSpank, including a healing spell. Synopsis DeathSpank is set in a fantasy medieval world. It revolves around a character named DeathSpank, who has searched his entire life for an item known as The Artifact, a mysterious object whose purpose is equally mysterious. He travels with a wizard known as Sparkles, and the duo seek to claim The Artifact and rid the land of evil. The story begins with The Artifact just out of DeathSpank's reach. Unable to claim it, he meets with a local witch, who promises to help him in exchange for his services. He provides her with her requested items, and eventually obtains The Artifact. The victory is short lived, however, as a group of henchmen who serve the evil Lord Von Prong steal The Artifact and all of DeathSpank's equipment. Traveling to a nearby town, he earns new weaponry from the townsfolk in exchange for doing good deeds. Re-equipped, he sets his sights back on The Artifact and Lord Von Prong. After a lengthy journey with several side quests throughout various locations, DeathSpank faces off against Lord Von Prong. He defeats Von Prong, and DeathSpank ends with a prelude to the game's sequel. Development and marketing DeathSpank was designed by Ron Gilbert, whose works include The Secret of Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion. DeathSpank was first confirmed on January 9, 2008 via a press release. The release stated that game designer Ron Gilbert would be joining forces to develop the game. Gilbert described it as \\"Monkey Island meets Diablo.\\" Three cinematic teaser trailers for DeathSpank were shown at Penny Arcade Expo 2008. During the 2009 Penny Arcade Expo DeathSpank was showcased at the Hothead Games booth, with live gameplay being demonstrated by staff, along with examples of story elements, and dialogue trees. It was announced on March 4, 2010 that Electronic Arts would publish the game. The game was released on July 13, 2010, on the PlayStation Network and July 14, 2010, on Xbox Live Arcade. It was later released for Microsoft Windows on October 26, 2010, and on Mac OS X December 14, 2010. The PC and Mac OS X versions support a wide range of resolutions, the ability to run the game windowed, input by keyboard and mouse as well as gamepad, alternate control schemes, and a key mapping ability. Gameplay enhancements based on feedback from the console versions include an equipment comparison function, a treasure chest feature in each town and major area, a new streamlined user interface and more. These versions also make use of Steam's cloud saving and achievement functionalities and leaderboards. In an interview with Gamasutra in June 2008, Gilbert stated that DeathSpank would be an episodic series of games. On March 30, 2009, Ron Gilbert confirmed on his blog that the game would no longer be episodic. Gilbert later revealed that the game had once again become episodic due to the game's size. \\"Towards the end of production it was determined what we had built was too big for a downloadable game, so the decision was made to split the game in half and the climactic battle with Lord Von Prong was the perfect place. That battle is in essence the end of Act I and it had a nice WTF moment that provided a nice cliff hanger\\" he stated. Gilbert has described DeathSpank as being \\"Act I\\" in his story, and Thongs of Virtue as being \\"Acts II and III\\". The title character originated in Ron Gilbert's Grumpy Gamer comics, created by Gilbert and Clayton Kauzlaric, who they later developed further. The character DeathSpank is voiced by Michael Dobson. Gilbert and Kauzlaric created a rough design for the game and pitched it to publishers for over four years without success. Previously, Gilbert had consulted for Penny Arcade Adventures: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness at Hothead Games; he contacted them and a deal was struck for the company to develop the game. A more in-depth design for DeathSpank was then produced. Kauzlaric remained involved with the project, consulting on design, story and concept art. Gilbert departed Hothead Games upon completion of the game. Reception DeathSpank has received generally positive reviews from critics. At aggregate website GameRankings it holds scores of 79-80% for the platforms it was released on. Fellow aggregate website Metacritic reports similar scores, with both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions averaging 79/100 and the PC version holding a score of 78/100. The game has sold over 91,000 units as of October 2010 with a total of over 97,000 units as of year-end 2010. Year-end 2011 analyses showed a movement of over 122,000 units. The PlayStation 3 version sold similarly, with nearly 107,000 units sold at the end of 2010. Some critics cited elements The Secret of Monkey Island and Diablo in the game. The game's humor was lauded among most critics. Thierry Nguyen of 1UP.com enjoyed the character's interactions, and noted, \\"a sort of deadpan absurdity where pretty much anything [...] gets said as naturally as we would discuss the time of day.\\" Game Revolution's Duke Ferris agreed, and stated the game was \\"genuinely funny.\\" He then pointed out several instances of humorous quests, conversations, and actions. XPlay's Rob Manuel stated that \\"most of the thanks here should go to Ron Gilbert.\\" He then referenced two of Gilbert's previous games, The Secret of Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion. Manuel went on to add, \\"his sharp and often dark sense of humor permeates everything from quests to settings.\\" Eurogamer's Dan Pearson felt the humor was borderline irreverent and said, \\"I can't help feel I'm not really part of DeathSpanks target audience.\\" Critics universally applauded the unique art style of DeathSpank. GameSpot's Tom Mc Shea called the visuals \\"imaginative\\", and added, \\"the colorful visuals are reason enough to check out every corner.\\" The reviewers from Australia's Good Game said they \\"liked [DeathSpanks] rolling countryside effect, so you feel like you're walking around a small planetoid filled with pop-up 2D sprites.\\" Joystiq's Randy Nelson lauded the visual and audio design of the game, and stated, \\"[it] resonates with charm created by artists, animators and Gilbert's own writing.\\" GamePros Will Herring added that the game had a \\"charming visual design.\\" The gameplay was also point of high praise among most reviewers, however elements of it were criticized. Martin Gaston of VideoGamer.com stated, \\"the game goes out of its way to ensure you're always taking on new and different enemies.\\" Randy Nelson of Joystiq noted that the game was diverse in its puzzles, adding that the developers strayed from stereotypical quotas such as killing a certain number of enemies. IGN's Kristine Steimer disagreed, and noted that due to experiences in past Gilbert-designed games, she expected more quests which included puzzles. She stated, \\"I was expecting a bit more given the developer's background.\\" Martin Gaston of VideoGamer.com later stated that DeathSpank \\"all feels a bit diluted, as if a single drop of Diablo and Monkey Island has been added to an entire gallon of water.\\" Destructoid's Nick Chester praised the combat system and role-playing elements. \\"Chaining attacks is exceedingly satisfying, experimenting with various weapon combinations nearly as addictive as finding them in the first place\\" stated Chester Some reviewers noted that the addition of cooperative gameplay, while welcome, was unbalanced and underdeveloped. GamePros Will Herring disagreed and stated that the second player's character \\"won't steal the screen from the titular lead, but the option to team up and complete the game with a friend is a fun and worthwhile distraction.\\" The PC version of the game received praise for its faithful reproduction of gameplay from the console versions. The addition of keyboard and mouse gameplay received mixed views from critics. Game Revolution's Josh Laddin felt that the keyboard controls were frustrating and said, \\"the keyboard controls aren't as intuitive as a gamepad.\\" However Marko Djordjevic of GameFocus disagreed and stated, \\"once you get the hang of it [...] it feels exactly as you’d expect.\\" Djordjevic further appreciated that the cooperative gameplay was ported over from the console versions. Sequels DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue, the second title in the series, was announced August 23, 2010 and first released September 20, 2010. It continues where DeathSpank ends, and features the use of ranged weapons such as machine guns and rocket launchers. It was first released on the PlayStation 3 on September 21, 2010. The Xbox 360 version was released September 22, 2010 and the PC version November 30, 2010. The Mac OS X version was December 14, 2010. A third game, The Baconing, was released in August 2011. The plot follows DeathSpank after he decides to try on all of the Thongs of Virtue at once. This spawns an evil incarnation of himself, the Anti-Spank. DeathSpank must travel to the Fires of Bacon to destroy the thongs and the Anti-Spank. It will be the first DeathSpank title not to feature the titular character in its name; it has been reported that this has nothing to do with the departure of Ron Gilbert from Hothead Games.

Mercaz HaTorah was founded by Aryeh Rottman, and is currently led by his son, Mordechai Rottman, who is the rosh yeshiva (dean). The yeshiva caters primarily to students from the English-speaking world.  History  Mercaz HaTorah was founded in 1970 by Aryeh RottmanWein, Berel (19 December 2017) \\"Passings\\", Israel National News. Retrieved 5 August 2019. through the encouragement of his mentor, Chaim Kreiswirth, as a post-high school institute for Judaic and Talmudic legal studies. The yeshiva started with 15 students in a two-story building in the Arnona neighborhood of Jerusalem. Campus and enrollment While Mercaz HaTorah is still located in its original location, the campus now consists of three spacious buildings. Current enrollment is 150 students. While students accepted to Mercaz HaTorah are drawn from all over the English-speaking world, they mostly come from the United States. Many of the students are sons of previous alumni. Curriculum Mercaz HaTorah places the study of the Babylonian Talmud at the core of its curriculum. The vast body of post-Talmudic literature and commentary is analysed as the foundation of halakha (Jewish law). The classic commentaries of Rashi, Tosafot, Nachmanides, Rashba, and Ritva, in addition to Medieval codifiers such as Maimonides, Ran, Rosh, and Rif are all considered. To facilitate the student’s Talmudic progress, Mercaz HaTorah has adopted a learning pattern where each academic term highlights a specific Talmudic tractate or segment, which is uniformly studied by the entire student body. The variations in study levels depend upon the year of study the student is in, and whether the course constitutes a survey or an intensive study of the tractate. During the first year, students begin with the Hebraic and Aramaic readings in the structure and style of Talmudic argumentation, as well the interpretive points of the classic commentaries. Second year students acquire mastery of textual readings. The complexities of the Talmudic style, the articulation of the argumentative process and the conclusive decisions of these texts are explored in depth. Lectures focus on the deductive process, as students are encouraged to probe and challenge the various interpretations and comparative textual contradictions. Students who attain the third year advanced level of Talmudic research and analysis hone their analytic skills in understanding the novella of the Rishonim and the methods of cataloging their diverse halakhic approaches. Study of the Maimonidean Code of Law as a quasi- legally binding discipline, including through its commentaries, is introduced by the process of gleaning Maimonides' interpretative stances in the Talmud from premises evident in his halakhic decisions. Similarly, the interpretive works of prominent Achronim are employed in understanding the legal and theoretical points of the Rishonim. The diverse approaches of leading 19th and 20th-century Talmudic analysts receive prominent attention.

While some of the faculty and students remained, a number of rabbis and students decided to move to the new yeshiva, which opened in August 2015. The two yeshivas now work in harmony to help each student reach their potential.

The tennin sees him taking it and demands its return—she cannot return to Heaven without it. The fisherman argues with her, and finally promises to return it, if she will show him her dance or part of it. She accepts his offer. The Chorus explains the dance as symbolic of the daily changes of the moon. The words about \\"three, five, and fifteen\\" refer to the number of nights in the moon's changes.

It is also a civil parish in the historic barony of Coonagh. and is an ecclesiastical parish in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly. The name Doon, deriving from the common Irish place name term Dún meaning \\"fort\\", can also be found as the name of various different townlands in Ireland. Origin of the name In Irish Dún Bleisce. Dún means fortification and the Ordnance Survey map of the area records eight ring forts. The main such ring fort is located behind the Church of Ireland Church outside the village. The Bleisce part is more difficult to explain. Speculation on the origin of the name revolves around three theories. The first theory is that the name is derived from a stream – in Irish fleisc - which flows through the village. The second is that Bleisc was the name of a swine herder for a local chieftain. The third is that Bleisc was \\"a woman of ill repute\\", a harlot whose \\"dún\\" was a favourite haunt of soldiers of the Crown. The first mention of the name Dún Bleisce was in the Annals of Inisfallen in 774 and for hundreds of years the village was known by this name. In 2003, the Placename Commission recommended that the official translation for Doon be changed to An Dún as it \\"was the appropriate Irish name for the village\\". After a sustained campaign by locals which included a motion being adopted by Limerick County Council in November 2006 to request the name be changed back, the locals got their wish. The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Eamon O'Cuiv, approved the reversion saying that the alternative Dún Bleisce had an \\"attested historical basis\\". Education Doon has two primary schools and one secondary school. Doon Convent Primary School was opened in 1868 by the Sister of Mercy. Doon Convent was founded in 1865. It was the brain-child of Rev. Patrick Hickey P.P., who realised that a sound system of education was the only hope for the deprived people of the area. He had a grand-niece in the Convent of Mercy, Kinsale, Co. Cork and he invited sisters from Kinsale to come to Doon, which they did in February 1865. Religious instruction and visitation of the sick were the main works carried out by the first Sisters of Mercy. They had no school so they instructed groups in the garden. In 1867 the Archbishop of Cashel visited the Convent (the Parish Priest's house) and gave the Sister's permission to build a school. The school was opened in 1868. Due to the closure of the National school and overcrowding in the Convent school an additional storey was built in 1878. The children were taught Religion, English reading and writing, instrumental music and singing and crafts such as embroidery and painting. A small boarding school was started for those children who were too far away to attend daily. Stanley's Education Act of 1831 had given state aid for the National Education or Primary education in Ireland. In the beginning this applied only to none denominational schools but after 1846 a compromise was reached between the Catholic interests and the British government. The result of this was religious orders accepted the state-aid system of Primary education and integrated into it a special time for religious education at the end of the day. This was the system that the Mercy Sisters operated in Doon. =Education since 1924= In 1924 the new Dail Eireann dissolved the Board of Commissioners which had been set up by the Stanley Education Act. All the powers and functions of this commission were transferred to the new Department of Education. Irish became an important subject in the school curriculum so the Sisters began to learn Irish and took a qualifying examination in Irish. They prepared students for the Senior Oxford in 1921, established a Secondary Top in 1924 had a Matriculation class in 1925. In 1928 pupils sat for the Intermediate Certificate. The Convent of Mercy N.S. is located in the grounds of the Convent of Mercy, Doon, Co. Limerick. The school is co-educational from Junior Infants to 1st Class. From 2nd Class to 6th Class, the classes are all girls. * CBS Primary School. In July 1864, Rev. Patrick Hickey PP died, leaving some property in his will to be used to purchase a house and school in Doon for the Christian Brothers. In 1870 Br. Walsh of Sexton St., Limerick selected two acres as a site for the monastery and school. In 1874 the school was opened by Br. Bruno Goode. A new primary school building was opened in September 1967. * St Joseph's Secondary School for girls – In 1930 the first secondary school was built. The first group of Leaving Cert pupils sat their exam in 1936. The subjects presented were Irish, English, Maths. French, History, Geography and Drawing. Latin was also taught though not for examination as yet. In 1940 the Secondary Top gave way to the new secondary school. During these years the pupils were prepared for music exams, piano and violin. Plain chant was introduced and the Senior Choir was often awarded the diocesan cup for Plain Chant. Secondary School choirs won the National Trophy, the Pigott Cup, three times in succession in the early 1960s. Light operas were produced annually in those years. The number of pupils grew over the years. Free education, introduced in 1966 gave a further increase. New school buildings were added to accommodate the increasing numbers. In September 1961 the final permanent school building was opened. On 24 May 2013 at 7.30 pm mass was celebrated in the local parish church, to mark the closing of the school. St Joseph's Secondary School, Doon finally closed its doors in June 2013 following the amalgamation of St. Fintans Christian Brothers School (ERST), St Michael's College, Cappamore (Co. Limerick VEC) and St Joseph's Mercy Secondary School (CEIST). * St. Fintans CBS for boys – Around 1908 the \\"classical school\\" was launched under the direction of Br. Alban O'Donoghue and was given the name \\"St. Fintan's Collegiate School\\", Doon, which gradually developed into a secondary school. This was rehoused in its current location around 1984. St. Fintan's CBS finally closed its doors in June 2013 following the amalgamation of St. Fintans Christian Brothers School (ERST), St Michael's College, Cappamore (Co. Limerick VEC) and St Joseph's Mercy Secondary School (CEIST). *Scoil na Tríonóide Naofa is the new secondary school in Doon, Co. Limerick. It was formed from the amalgamation of St. Fintan's CBS, St. Joseph's Convent of Mercy and St. Michael's College and is a voluntary secondary school under the patronage of CEIST. The construction company BAM commenced building works on a 15-acre site donated by the Mercy Congregation, at Liscaugh, Doon, Co. Limerick. The \\"Turning of the Sod\\" for the new school called Scoil na Trionóide Naofa, took place on the green field site at Doon, Co. Limerick on Tuesday 11 December 2012. Scoil na Trionóide Naofa opened to pupils in February 2014. Mudslide In July 2014 Doon was hit by a mudslide caused by a torrential downpour. A river of mud flowed down the hill carrying much debris including tree trunks, boulders and railway sleepers. People reported being trapped in cars and sheds unable to return to their homes while the rain was falling. Rivers burst their banks and bridges were destroyed.http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/town-hit-by-massive-mud-slide- and-flood-in-freak- storm-637439.htmlhttp://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/midlands-town-hit-by- freak-flood-and-mudslides-276789.html Many roads around the area were closed and the bridge on the road to Kilcommon is closed indefinitely. Sport Doon GAA club was founded in 1888 and has provided several players to the county (Limerick) and provincial (Munster) hurling squads. The current ground was opened in 1994 and the dressing rooms were built in 2002. The team has reached the final of the Limerick Senior Hurling Championship twice, losing to Ballybrown in 1989 and Patrickswell in 2000. In 1973 a Doon player, Willie Moore, was present in the Limerick team which beat Kilkenny to win the all- Ireland hurling final. Places of interest Castle Garde, originally built by the O'Briens, was restored in the early 1800s by Waller O'Grady, to a design of the architects James Pain and George Richard Pain. The design offers many notable features such as the circular keep, square-plan tower, and crenellated parapets. The carved statues, inside the gate house, are particularly fine and unusual features, representing Bacchus, Venus and Athene. The stone head to the main door represents Brian Boru.

The group toured the United States in 1986, replacing Les Cheetam with Greg Reiter. The percussion duty of the US tour fell to Darren Kurland as drummer. After four months, returning to England, the group broke up, blaming poor record label support preventing the band exploiting their potential in the United States.

He works with individuals, companies and organisations throughout the world inspiring, mentoring and challenging them to be the best that they can be. He started his first business at 15 years of age and has since had businesses in property development, finance, construction, insurance, tourism and film production. Falvey was the first person to complete the Seven Summits twice by reaching the summit of Mount Everest from both the Tibetan (1996) and Nepalese sides (2003). He was expedition leader of the team that saw Clare O'Leary become the first Irish woman to reach the summit of Mount Everest (2003). Other extreme expeditions include walking to the South Pole, crossing South Georgia Island and traversing the Greenland ice cap.  Early life  Born and raised on the north side of Cork city, Ireland, Falvey started mountain climbing in his late twenties, having worked as a builder and property developer from his late teens onwards. Following the economic recession of the mid-1980s in Ireland, he lost most of his wealth and discovered mountaineering in his late 20s.  Mountain climbing career  Falvey began his climbing career with hill walking and climbing on the McGillycuddy Reeks in County Kerry, Ireland. Falvey then devoted himself to training to become a high-altitude mountaineer. He trained initially with the Cork Mountaineering Club, at Tiglin in County Wicklow and became a member of Kerry Mountain Rescue, climbing very frequently in Ireland, Scotland, France and the Himalayas. In June 1994, Falvey climbed Mount Denali in Alaska, reaching the first summit in his Seven Summits attempt. This was followed by Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania (January 1995); Mount Everest via the Northeast Ridge (June 1995); Mount Aconcagua in Argentina (December 1995); Mount Elbrus in Russia (March 1996); Mount Vinson in Antarctica (January 1997) and Mount Kosciusko in Antarctica (February 1997). He was the first Irish man (and the 32nd person in the world) to complete the Seven Summits. Falvey was the expedition leader of the first Irish team to reach the summit of Cho Oyu in China and Nepal without oxygen, on 20 May 1998. He reached the summit of Ama Dablam in Nepal on 3 November 1999. In 2003, Falvey was the expedition leader of the first Irish team to reach the summit of Mount Everest via the South-Southeast Ridge, with team members Ger McDonnell and Mick Murphy reaching the summit. On 18 May 2004, Falvey reached the summit of Everest via the South-Southeast Ridge, and led the expedition that saw the first Irish woman, Dr Clare O'Leary, reach the top of Everest. Falvey and O'Leary completed the Seven Summits on 16 December 2005, when Falvey became the first person to complete the Seven Summits twice by climbing Mount Everest from both the Tibetan and Nepalese sides.  Polar career  In 2006, Falvey led a group of 32 across the South Georgia Traverse on South Georgia Island in honour of Polar explorers Sir Ernest Shackleton and Kerryman Tom Crean, in the Beyond Endurance Antarctic expedition. He led the first Irish traverse of Greenland in 2006. In January 2008, he led a four-person Irish expedition to the South Pole. In April 2009, Falvey and O'Leary did a 'symbolic' walk to the North Pole, completing the final four-day trek to the Pole.  Publications  Falvey, Pat, with Collins, Dan (1997).

It played an especially notable role, in the hands of British cavalrymen, at the battles of Salamanca and Waterloo. The pattern was adopted by Sweden and was used by some Portuguese cavalry. Background The British 1796 Heavy Cavalry Trooper's Sword was a direct copy of the Austrian pallasch sword pattern of 1769 for heavy cavalry (it later received an iron scabbard (1775), in which form it was adopted by the British). John Le Marchant, a cavalry officer who designed the curved 1796 pattern light cavalry sabre, undoubtedly saw the Austrian weapon in use during the Low Countries Campaign of 1793-95, when he also made many drawings of Austrian cavalry equipment. His initial intention was that his own sword design should be adopted by all the cavalry; however, this was denied by the decision of the board of general officers to arm the heavy cavalry with a straight sword. It is probable, once a straight sword had been decided upon, that he then suggested the Austrian sword as a model.Thoumine 1968, pp. 44-45.Robson 1975, p. 23. Design=Trooper's pattern= A British 1796 Heavy Cavalry Sword purchased by Sweden in 1808. Pattern 1796 Heavy Cavalry Trooper's Sword. Pattern 1796 Heavy Cavalry Officer's Sword. Pattern 1796 Heavy Cavalry Officer's Dress Sword. Technically the 1796 heavy cavalry sword was a backsword, that is a sword with a straight blade with one cutting edge and the opposite edge of the blade (the \\"back\\") thickened for most of its length to give added strength. The blade was in length, with a single broad fuller each side. The grip was of ribbed wood, or wood bound with cord to resemble the same, and covered in leather. The iron backpiece of the grip had ears which were riveted through the tang of the blade to give the hilt and blade a very secure connection. The hilt combined a disc guard pierced with 2 semicircular and 6 oval (never circular) holes, with single knucklebow and two slim long langets (projections from the guard, which gripped the throat of the scabbard) extending from the front of the guard. The langets were often removed and the left side of the guard ground away so as to reduce wear to uniforms. The latter modification would also have made it more comfortable to wear, especially on horseback.Robson 1975, p. 26 The sword was often modified by its users. The point was originally a 'hatchet point', a curved diagonal front edge similar to that of the Japanese katana, but most were altered to a symmetrical 'spear point', more common at the time, or alternatively made more acute whilst retaining the asymmetry of the tip. This was done in order to improve the sword's ability to thrust. Quite large numbers of spear-pointed examples exist with blades, along with an appropriately shortened scabbard. These may be conversions of the original standard blade, although many appear to have been manufactured to this shorter length. The sword was carried in an iron scabbard with wooden liners, and hung from the waist via sword-belt slings attached to two loose suspension rings.Robson 1975, pp. 23-27 =Household cavalry other ranks= Variant sword types with the standard trooper's blade, but a bowl hilt similar to that of the officers' pattern, in brass with a brass scabbard (for the Life Guards) or iron with an iron scabbard (for the Horse Guards), exist and are believed to have been issued to the other ranks of the Household regiments for use when on home (ceremonial) service. The scabbards of these swords did not usually have suspension rings, but were fitted with a button or slide for use with a 'frog' - a type of baldric or belt attachment. It is known that the Household regiments employed the standard trooper's pattern swords on active service.Robson 1975, pp. 94-98 =Officer's patterns= Officers carried a service sword, also termed an \\"undress sword\\", with a blade of identical general form to that of the trooper's pattern detailed above. However, many officers' blades bore etched, or blued and gilt, decoration. The guard, in contrast, was entirely different from the trooper's pattern, being of bowl form, and incorporating an elaborate pierced honeysuckle design with a prominent rear quillon. This hilt form is often referred to as a 'ladder hilt' (due to the pierced knucklebow resembling a ladder).Robson 1975, pp. 66-67 The dress sword for Heavy Cavalry officers was a much smaller and lighter weapon, having a knucklebow, ovoid pommel and boat-shell guard in gilt brass or gunmetal. The blade was much shorter and narrower than the service sword's, and usually double edged with a short narrow central fuller each side.Robson 1975, pp. 66-67 The dress sword usually had a leather scabbard with gilt brass mounts, however, a number of examples exist of swords with iron service scabbards, suggesting that some officers may have employed the dress sword in the field. Use The trooper's sword, and the officer's undress sword, was a dedicated cutting weapon with a broad heavy blade and was renowned as being completely unfit for delicate swordsmanship. This was also the foundation for respect it gained from those who appreciated it; most cavalry troopers used the blades like bludgeons and the guards as knuckle dusters (as Le Marchant observed) and the 1796 was significantly more suited for this than most other swords.Fletcher 1999, p. 39Maughan, pp. 12-13 A well-known description of the brutal power of the weapon was made by Sgt. Charles Ewart, 2nd Dragoons (Scots Greys) concerning how he captured an Imperial Eagle at Waterloo: \\"It was in the charge I took the eagle off the enemy; he and I had a hard contest for it; he made a thrust at my groin I parried it off and cut him down through the head. After this a lancer came at me; I threw the lance off my right side, and cut him through the chin upwards through the teeth. Next, a foot soldier fired at me, then charged me with his bayonet, which I also had the good luck to parry, and I cut him down through the head; thus ended the contest.\\"Fletcher 1999, p. 247 In fiction The fictional character most often associated with the 1796 Heavy Cavalry Sword is Richard Sharpe, Bernard Cornwell's Napoleonic Rifle officer.Fletcher 1996, p. 109 See also *1796 Pattern British Infantry Officer's Sword *Pattern 1796 light cavalry sabre NotesReferences * *Fletcher, Ian (1996) Napoleonic Wars: Wellington's Army, Brassey's, London. *Fletcher, Ian (1999) Galloping at Everything, Spellmount (Staplehurst). *Maughan, Stephen (Undated) Household Cavalry in the Waterloo Campaign, Napoleonic Archive. *Robson, B.

It's identified as one of the \\"major roguelikes\\" by John Harris. Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup polled first in a 2008 poll of 371 roguelike players, and later polled second in 2009 (behind DoomRL) and 2010 (behind ToME 4), and third in 2011 (behind ToME 4 and Dungeons of Dredmor). Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup is released under the GNU GPL version 2 or later. The latest release is version 0.25, released on June 12th, 2020. Gameplay Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup is a roguelike game where the player creates a character and guides it through a dungeon, mostly consisting of persistent levels, full of monsters and items, with the goal of retrieving the \\"Orb of Zot\\" (a MacGuffin) located there, and escaping alive. To enter the Realm of Zot where the Orb is located, the player must first obtain at least three \\"runes of Zot\\" of the 15 available; these are located at the ends of diverse dungeon branches such as the Spider Nest, Tomb, and Slime Pits. The game has an explicit design philosophy intended to provide interesting strategic and tactical choices within a balanced game; to offer replayability based on random dungeon generation; to make the game accessible and enjoyable without deep knowledge of its internal mechanics; and to present a friendly user interface that can optionally automate several tasks like exploration and searching for previously seen items. Conversely, the developer team seeks to avoid providing incentives for repeating boring actions without consideration, or providing illusory gameplay choices where one alternative is always superior. Most levels are randomly generated to maximize variety, while the levels containing the objective items are randomly chosen between several manually-designed layouts, which usually contain random elements, and which are authored in a Crawl-specific language incorporating Lua scripting. Randomly generated levels may contain randomly chosen manually designed fragments called \\"vaults\\", as well as portals to special manually designed mini-levels called \\"portal vaults\\" such as volcanoes and wizard's laboratories. Characters are initially defined by their species and their background. Character advancement is based on experience points gained by defeating monsters, which increase both an experience level and a set of skills including melee weapons, ranged weapons and magic. The player determines which skills to increase. The species choice determines the aptitudes of the character for each of the skills, which represent how much experience is needed to raise the skill to higher levels and adds species- specific abilities. In the 0.20 version, 27 species are available, from those with little deviation from the common mechanics such as humans and hill orcs, to species such as mummies and octopodes which have unusual gameplay mechanics. The background choice determines the starting skills and equipment, with about 24 choices such as fighters, necromancers, and berserkers; unlike species choice, background choice only affects the start of the game - the player is not prevented from pursuing any skills and using any equipment. Some backgrounds also start with a fictional religion, and in general it is possible to acquire or change the character's religion once the appropriate altar is found; the choice of the god to worship significantly impacts gameplay, because each god rewards and punishes a different set of actions, and offers a specific set of abilities and gifts inspired by original lore. Some gods offer enhancements to existing play styles, such as Okawaru gifting weapons and boosting combat or Sif Muna gifting spell books and extra MP regeneration, while others force unusual demands on the players in exchange for significant bonuses, like Cheibriados who wants devotees to move slowly and Ashenzari limiting the ability to swap equipment in return for divinations and skill boosts, and Xom, who is the DCSS equivalent of the trickster god archetype. Additionally, abandoning gods usually causes them to become angry at the player, which can cause them to summon powerful monsters or inflict nasty effects like slowing, reduction of max HP, or large amounts of damage on the player. History=Linley's Dungeon Crawl= Linley's Dungeon Crawl (or just Dungeon Crawl or Crawl) was a roguelike computer game originally programmed by Linley Henzell in 1995, and first released to the general public on October 2, 1997.First post about new release at groups.google.com The game had a quirky license based on Bison's license and the NetHack License;http://www.dungeoncrawl.org/?d.l Stone Soup has contacted every past contributor and relicensed to GPLv2+. Original gameplay Crawl starts with the player's choice of one of over twenty races: several different types of elves, dwarves, humans, ogres, tengu, centaurs, merfolk, and other fantasy beings. Racial selection sets base attributes, future skill advancement, and physical characteristics such as movement, resistances, and special abilities. Subject to racial exclusions, the player next chooses a character class from among over twenty selections. Classes include the traditional roles of fighter, wizard, and thief as well as specialty roles, among them monks, berserkers, assassins, crusaders, and elemental spellcasters. Wanderers represent an atypical option and receive a random skill set. Together, class and race determine base equipment and skill training, though characters may later attempt to acquire any in-game skill. The Crawl skill system covers many abilities, including the ability to move freely in armor or silently, mount effective attacks with different categories of weapons (polearms, long or short blades, maces, axes, and staves), master spells from different magical colleges (the elements, necromancy, conjuration, enchantments, summoning, etc.), utilize magical artifacts, and pray to divinities. Training occurs through repetition of skill-related actions (e.g., hitting a monster with a longsword trains long blades and fighting skills), using experience from a pool refilled as the player defeats monsters. John Harris, in his \\"@Play\\" column states that the experience pool system \\"deftly avoids the many problems of a skill-based development system\\", mainly praising the need to move on through the course of the game to further improve a PC's skills. In the same article, John Harris states that this experience system \\"is probably the best skill system yet seen in any roguelike; it could make a claim at being one of the best in any CRPG.\\" Religion within Crawl is a central game mechanic. Its diverse pantheon of gods reward character conformance to particular codes of conduct. Trog, the berserker god, expects abstinence from casting spells and offers aid in battle, whereas Sif Muna expects frequent spellcraft in exchange for magical assistance and gifts of spellbooks. Some deities campaign against evil, matched by a god of death who revels in indiscriminate killing, while others prove unpredictable objects of worship. Xom, an example of the latter, toys with followers, meting out punishments and showering gifts on inscrutable whims. The goal of Crawl is to recover the \\"Orb of Zot\\" hidden deep within a dungeon complex. To achieve this objective, characters must visit various dungeon branches, such as the Orcish Mines or The Lair of Beasts, which often branch further in to additional areas, like the Elven Halls or The Swamp, and obtain at least three \\"Runes of Zot\\" with which to gain access to the Orb. Fifteen different runes can be obtained in any particular game, and obtaining all of them is generally considered an extra feat. While all the possible 654 race/class combinations have been won on the online servers, only 186 of them were ever played online as an all-rune win (as of 2010-08-24). Dungeon maps in Crawl persist, as in NetHack. Versions The last official versions of Linley's Dungeon Crawl were 4.0.0 beta 26, from March 24, 2003, and a later alpha release, version 4.1.0, dating from July 2005. Version 400b26e070t, a popular last community release, includes the 2003-2004 Patches (Darshan Shaligram) and updates the game to the standard tile version (M. Itakura, Denzi, Alex Korol, Nullpodoh). The game has been ported to the Nintendo DS as DSCrawl. =DCSS= Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup was begun in 2006 by Darshan \\"greensnark\\" Shaligram and Erik Piper as an attempt to restart Crawl development, which had progressed slowly in the years since Linley Henzell, creator of the original Linley's Dungeon Crawl, had retired from developing the game. Several interesting patches had been made to the game in recent years, particularly one by Shaligram known as the 'Travel patch', which borrowed the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm from NetHack to provide an auto-exploration ability in game. These patches were compiled into the Stone Soup project, which was eventually released publicly on Sourceforge. Stone Soup has since then developed an unprecedented variety of extensions which fit into this general vein of \\"play aid\\", such as allowing searching through every item ever discovered by regular expression. Additionally, Stone Soup has made a number of user interface improvements, such as mouse interaction and an (optional) graphical user interface. In order to avoid featuritis, Stone Soup has also pruned gameplay elements which they considered superfluous, including several races and a magical school. The development team has also expressed a desire to maintain the current total length of the game, and so as new areas are added to the dungeon, old ones have been shortened or even removed to compensate. Graphical tile version Tiles version One notable addition of the Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup branch is the ability to play (locally or in a web browser) using a graphical tile version of the game. Players unfamiliar with the genre may find the tile version more accessible. Android versions There are two Android ports of the game available. An unofficial port of the console version was developed and released on Google Play. There is also an port of the tile version that is under development. The latest unstable builds can be downloaded from the official website. Online play Several public servers support online play through an SSH client and some of these also allow graphical play in web browser (referred to as webtiles). Features of online play include automated high-score tracking and real-time recording of online play for later viewing. Also, ghosts of other players' characters are frequently encountered on a player's journey, providing an additional challenge. A biannual tournament for all Stone Soup players is held after each major release on the servers (usually in September and April). Additionally, players may test experimental game modes, races, and gods, that are not yet ready to be added to the main version.

Over the next several months, Knight's commercial was screened at the American Film Institute, and was featured on the Heritage Foundation website\\"The Heritage Foundation: School Board Jedi, July 9, 2007\\" and in many other media outlets including The Jay Leno Show, The Soup, on MTV and numerous international programming. The VH1/Viacom/YouTube copyright infringement claim The television program Web Junk 20 on VH1 aired a special presentation titled \\"Animals and Other Crap\\" in July 2007. The show, which highlights funny and unusual video clips found on the Internet, showed Knight's first school board commercial along with commentary by host Aries Spears. Knight later said that no one from the network had approached him about using his commercial for a for-profit broadcast, or had even told him that it would be aired by the network. However, Knight also said that he thought that the show was so good and Spears' commentary to be so witty, that he didn't mind that VH1 used it at all. As he had done with his original commercial, Knight uploaded the Web Junk 20 segment on YouTube so that he could share it with friends. On August 29, 2007, YouTube notified Knight him that his video of the Web Junk 20 clip had been taken down at the insistence of VH1's parent company Viacom, claiming Knight's use of the clip was copyright infringement and violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Upon being presented with the claim, YouTube had no choice but to pull it per DMCA mandate. Knight objected, as Web Junk 20 had lifted his own material, and claimed that Viacom had violated his copyright first. Knight contended that per the Copyright Act of 1976, his uploading of the Web Junk 20 clip featuring his own commercial satisfied the four criteria for fair use. and that VH1's segment was a derivative work of his own, since the Web Junk 20 clip was based on Knight's original commercial and could not have existed without it. Viacom countered that the Web Junk 20 clip was indeed its own copyrighted material, acknowledging that although it used the commercial that Knight had produced himself, that VH1 had added Aries Spears's image and commentary. Viacom asserted that this was enough to make the entire content of the Web Junk 20 clip, including use of Knight's commercial, their own material protected under copyright. Following guidelines on YouTube's site, Knight filed a Digital Millennium Copyright Act counter- notification claim,Knight, Christopher. \\"YOUTUBE/VIACOM AFTERMATH - Part 2: The DMCA Counter-Notification Claim.\\" The Knight Shift. September 19, 2007. Retrieved November 11, 2009. and per DMCA provisions, Viacom was legally bound to take one of two options: to take Knight to court and file a lawsuit against him for copyright infringement, or to let the video be restored on YouTube. After the story gained considerable press coverage, Viacom relented,Goel, Vindu. \\"Followup: Chris Knight wins battle with Viacom over YouTube clip.\\" Vindu's View from the Valley. September 11th, 2007. Retrieved November 11, 2009. and YouTube reinstated Knight's clip of Web Junk 20 featuring his campaign commercial. The incident has since been referenced in several other stories regarding YouTube and cases of possible copyright infringement, including that of the Lenz family's lawsuit against Universal\\"The Home Video Prince Doesn't Want You to See.\\" ABC News. October 26, 2007. regarding a clip they had posted onto YouTube that included several seconds of a song by musical artist Prince. After Viacom relented and dropped its claim, Knight asserted that he had no ill toward Viacom and asked his readers to do likewise. \\"This ends just as I had hoped it would: with the clip back up and, I like to think, with Viacom and me getting to shake hands and move on and wishing each other well. I'll certainly harbor no hard feelings toward Viacom for the past two weeks.\\"  Other Works  In late 2010 Knight used his blog to go public about his longtime diagnosis of bipolar disorder. He has since devoted much effort toward sharing his experiences with severe depression, mania, and the treatment of his disease. As of 2015 Knight is writing a book about his life with mental illness. Knight and his filmmaking partner Ed Woody are the founders of KWerky Productions. Knight's first film Forcery - a parody of the film adaptation of the Stephen King novel Misery - was heavily featured in the award-winning documentary The People vs. George Lucas. Knight is a published op-ed writer who maintains that he is extremely nonpartisan and asks to not be considered as either a conservative or a liberal. He had stated numerous times that he refuses to vote for or endorse any candidate who produces even a single negative campaign ad against an opponent, without exception. He is active in community theatre and enjoys knifemaking. As of 2016 Knight is traveling across the United States.

It stars Shirley MacLaine, James Coburn, Susan Sarandon and Stephen Collins. Plot The plot offers a comic spin on adultery. When Greg crashes his sports car, doctor Evelyn comes to his rescue, and the two soon are engaged in an affair. Evelyn's workaholic husband learns about it from Greg's live-in girlfriend, scatterbrained television weather girl Stephanie, and the two begin to engage in a dalliance of their own. Complications arise when the two couples plan a clandestine weekend getaway at the same Acapulco resort. Production notes The scenes in Mexico actually were shot in San Diego, California, and the hotel interiors were filmed at the Ambassador Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles. The film grossed $2,806,659 in the US. Together with A Change of Seasons, the film was one of two 1980 20th Century Fox releases starring Shirley MacLaine that dealt with the subject of marital infidelity. Coburn said \\"“It was a change of pace. It was a comedy. I thought it was pretty good. But, there was another film out around the same time with Shirley MacLaine called A CHANGE OF SEASONS.

Esbensen. 50 years of Pierre Gy's “Theory of Sampling”—WCSB1: a tribute. Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems. Volume 74, Issue 1, 28 November 2004, pages 3-6. Gy's sampling theory uses a model in which the sample taking is represented by independent Bernoulli trials for every particle in the parent population from which the sample is drawn. The two possible outcomes of each Bernoulli trial are: (1) the particle is selected and (2) the particle is not selected. The probability of selecting a particle may be different during each Bernoulli trial. The model used by Gy is mathematically equivalent to Poisson sampling. Using this model, the following equation for the variance of the sampling error in the mass concentration in a sample was derived by Gy: :V = \\\\frac{1}{(\\\\sum_{i=1}^N q_i m_i)^2} \\\\sum_{i=1}^N q_i(1-q_i) m_{i}^{2} \\\\left(a_i - \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{j=1}^N q_j a_j m_j}{\\\\sum_{j=1}^N q_j m_j}\\\\right)^2 . in which V is the variance of the sampling error, N is the number of particles in the population (before the sample was taken), q i is the probability of including the ith particle of the population in the sample (i.e. the first-order inclusion probability of the ith particle), m i is the mass of the ith particle of the population and a i is the mass concentration of the property of interest in the ith particle of the population. It is noted that the above equation for the variance of the sampling error is an approximation based on a linearization of the mass concentration in a sample. In the theory of Gy, correct sampling is defined as a sampling scenario in which all particles have the same probability of being included in the sample. This implies that q i no longer depends on i, and can therefore be replaced by the symbol q. Gy's equation for the variance of the sampling error becomes: :V = \\\\frac{1-q}{q M_\\\\text{batch}^2} \\\\sum_{i=1}^N m_{i}^{2} \\\\left(a_i - a_\\\\text{batch} \\\\right)^2 . where abatch is the concentration of the property of interest in the population from which the sample is to be drawn and Mbatch is the mass of the population from which the sample is to be drawn. It has been noted that a similar equation had already been derived in 1935 by Kassel and Guy.

After killing Ravana, Lord Ram had dosha which made him reflect two shadows apart from him being a god. He started pilgrim to remove his dosha and reached the present place of Mukteshwar and there one shadow disappeared. And so felt that place as sacred and did puja and yagya and installed mahadev linga there. And as his dosh was disappeared so the name was given as Mukteshwar, and the village named as Muktapuri. After completing the yagya he proceeded forward and reached at the present place of Rameshwar Mahadev. He arranged for the meals for Brahmins and for the fulfillment of the need for water he used the arrow named Gangasma. According to the rule before the meals for the worship of Lord Shiva he took sand in his hand from the place he shot arrow and installed Mahadev Linga.

This limit only applied to a portion of the postal market in a service industry of some 1,000 providers, but it created a monopoly. The \\"Letter Monopoly\\" was often justified by the provision of universal service by the state, but some German cities wanted it to be abolished. Abolition of the letter monopoly Since 1998, the German Federal Network Agency for Electricity, Gas, Telecommunications, Postal Service and Railways (Bundesnetzagentur, BNetzA) has licensed the professional transport of letters and mail, to which there was no weight restrictions. However, the relevant service providers were obliged to provide the so-called \\"higher-valued services\\" such as \\"same-day express delivery\\" or collection from the sender by the post office by 31 December 2007. Thus, additional costs that make it usually impossible for the licensees resulted in 'professional transport of letters' to set more favorably than the German post office AG in the \\"normal delivery\\" in comparison to the usual letter dispatch. With the cessation of the postal monopoly on 1 January 2008, the requirement to provide \\"higher-valued services\\" also fell away for the post office competitors. Problems for competitors under the new arrangements include Deutsche Post being exempt from the value added tax, while its competitors are not. Furthermore, the post office did not have to pay accident insurance for its employees. Possible competitors lodged complaints with the German Federal Constitutional Court and/or the Federal Finance Court. The Hermes logistics group requested abolition of the value added tax obligation on 12 December 2007 with the Federal Department of Finance starting from 1 January 2008. The decision of the Ministry is still pending. There are many enterprises in Germany, which offer the delivery of letters. Many of these are small and may be threatened by the new arrangements. In the long-term, as in other countries where the letter market was liberalized and/or completely opened, the former state enterprise Deutsche Post can expect to maintain a market share of over 90%. It is questionable whether a closed oligopoly can develop, in which a few different, well-financed enterprises can take part alongside Deutsche Post. Minimum wages for postal employees In September 2007, there was a fierce debate about the minimum wage for the post office employees in Germany. The trade union ver.di came to an agreement with the postal services employer's association for a collective agreement specifying a minimum wage of 8.00 – 9.80 euro per hour. This was strongly criticized by the private post office enterprises. Deutsche Post used its leadership in the employer's association of the postal services to dictate minimum wages, which did not allow the private post office enterprises to fairly compete.

The film was released in 1973. Plot In Perugia, the murder of several university students leads to a manhunt for a masked killer with a psychosexual disorder who uses red-and-black foulards to strangle his female victims before mutilating their bodies. When a wealthy student named Dani vaguely recalls having seen someone wearing such a scarf, she becomes the target of the mystery killer and, at her philandering uncle's suggestion, invites three of her girlfriends (two of them, lipstick lesbians) to stay with her at her family's remote country villa in Tagliacozzo. However, the isolated cliffside villa offers no protection from the killer, who has meanwhile run over the blackmailing street vendor he buys his scarves from. A local peeping tom and then Dani's impotent stalker (who wears a similar red-and-black scarf to the killer's) go up to the villa, only to be ruthlessly killed too. One of the girls, Jane, sprains her ankle and a local doctor gives her a sedative; as such, she is asleep when the killer forces his way into the villa and kills her three girlfriends. Jane wakes up the next day only to silently witness the unidentified killer dismember her friends' bodies. Having disposed of the corpses, the killer locks up the villa and departs, inadvertently leaving the injured Jane trapped inside. Later on, having realized that Jane is alive in the villa, the killer silently returns and reveals himself to her. The killer is Franz, an art history lecturer Jane had befriended. He is a psychopathic misogynist as a result of a childhood trauma when he witnessed his brother fall to his death as he was trying to fetch a little girl's doll at a cliff's edge. Franz tells Jane that his first two victims (whom he calls \\"filthy bitches\\" and \\"dolls made out of flesh and blood\\") had seduced him into a threesome and then blackmailed him. He had continued his killing spree in order to cover his tracks. As Franz proceeds to murder Jane to ensure he is never caught, the doctor shows up and, after a struggle, Franz falls to his death.

Joseph Brenner Associates later distributed a recut and rescored dubbed version as Torso in the US and the film became a success there on the drive-in and grindhouse circuits, often as a double feature with The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974). The film was released on DVD in the US by Anchor Bay Entertainment in 2000 and in the UK by Shameless in 2007. It has since had Blu-ray releases by Blue Underground in 2011, Shameless in 2017 and Arrow Video in 2018. = Critical response = George Anderson of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette deemed the film \\"another display of softcore sex and seamy violence that might better have been kept abroad.\\" Joe Baltake of the Philadelphia Daily News wrote: \\"Blood flows freely and limbs detach easily, in Sergio Martino's Torso, a disagreeable Italian import withnot surprisinglylittle to recommend it.\\" The Los Angeles Timess Linda Gross wrote that the film was a \\"lazy suspense movie\\" with a \\"disjointed and loose\\" screenplay. The extended cat-and-mouse villa scenes between the killer and the final girl in the film's last 30 minutes have led to Torso being retrospectively recognised as a \\"proto-slasher film\\". Quentin Tarantino showed his print of the film at the 1999 QT-Fest and fellow filmmaker Eli Roth has cited the film among his favourite gialli and an influence on Grindhouse and Hostel: Part II (both 2007). PopMatters gave it a 7 out of 10 rating, while Slant Magazine said it \\"pales next to director Sergio Martino's more inventive sleaze-thrillers (The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh, All the Colors of the Dark)\\".

It was originally found only on the Mediterranean islands of Corsica and Sardinia, but has since been introduced into many other regions of Europe.  Description  Male mouflon are known as rams and the females as ewes or wild ewes. The young animals are known as lambs.Walter Frevert: Jagdliches Brauchtum und Jägersprache. Franckh-Kosmos, Stuttgart 2011, , pp. 213–214  Appearance  European mouflon have a body length of up to 120 cm, a shoulder height of 90 cm, a weight of 25 to 40 kg for ewes, 35 to 55 kg for the ram. The European mouflon has a smooth hairy coat, the rams are fox red-brown in the summer, usually with a whitish saddle patch, the ewes are brownish. Both sexes are darker in winter. The rams have helix-shaped horns up to 80 cm long; females have no horns on Sardinia, but on Corsica they have smaller horns that are slightly curved towards the rear.  Senses  As an animal whose ancestors used to live in open terrain above the tree line, the eyesight of the mouflon is well developed. Its laterally- located eyes allow the mouflon to scan a wide arc without turning its head. In older rams, the field of view may be restricted by the position of the horn tip. As a result, rams begin to wear down these horns.Piegert et al., pp. 10-11 Their binocular vision is limited to a relatively small facial arc of 60 percent; only in this area can they see any depth of field; in the rest of their visual arc, mouflon can mainly just perceive movement. If mouflon are disturbed by a movement in their lateral field of vision, they turn their head toward the object, thereby locating it within the depth of the landscape. Only then do they try to gain additional information by testing the wind and their sense of hearing, in order to assess the level of danger posed by the disturbance.Piegert et al., p. 11 People may be seen at distances of up to 1,000 metres.Piegert et al., p. 13 Their sense of sight also plays a significant role in the cohesion of the herd. Mouflon who have lost their connection to their herd, search for it by rapidly running back and forth. Only then do they use their smell to follow the herd.Piegert et al., p. 13 Hearing plays a role in the maintenance of the social relationship between the members of the herd.  Vocalisations  The vocal repertoire of the mouflon is extensive and can be divided into contact and warning calls and wailing, as well as the mating calls of the rutting ram. Just a few minutes after the birth of a lamb, the ewe utters a short, sombre, bleating noise, to which the lamb replies, also bleating. In the herd, the sheep call for their lambs using a long drawn-out bleating. Lambs who are looking for their mothers bleat loudly, almost blaring.Piegert et al., p. 13 Wailing is heard from the lambs when they are attacked by an enemy or are severely injured. No wailing sound is made by adult mouflon.Piegert et al., p. 13 When alarmed, mouflon emit a hiss through their nostrils. Often, the warning call is preceded by a nervous stomping of the front feet. The warning call is quiet when a mouflon is only slightly disturbed, but becomes much louder as danger threatens. A herd whose leader makes this sound, flees immediately. If the sound is made by another animal in the herd, the rest begin to take defensive action, but continue to wait for the reaction of the leader.Piegert et al., p. 13 Rams make a rattling and snarling sound when chasing rutting ewes. The clashing of horns is one of the most familiar sounds of the mouflon. It is most common during the rutting season, but the rams fight each other all year round.Piegert et al., p. 14  Range  Originally, European mouflon lived in open, mountainous terrain on stony, dry soils. Today, in Central Europe, they live in deciduous and mixed forests, both on the lowlands and on the uplands and highlands such as the Central Uplands of Germany, but still preferring dry and stony soils. In unfavourable, humid soil conditions, it is easy for bowel diseases and foot rot to occur, which can be fatal. Predators Because their escape behaviour is adapted to high mountain areas, European mouflon can only survive on lowland areas in the absence of natural predators. Thus the mouflon population in the recently settled wolf regions of Lusatia was wiped out within a short period of time, while populations of wild boar and their main prey, deer, were barely affected.Beatrix Stoepel: Wölfe in Deutschland. Hamburg, 2004. . Whether this observation will apply in other areas, will only be possible to verify as wolves expand their territory in Central Europe. The resettlement of lynxes in the Harz Mountains, in combination with hard winters, has also led to a decline in the mouflon population.unsere Jagd magazine 1/2012. Article Mufflons droht das Aus Within the hunting community it was noted that the mouflon which were introduced in 1903 into the Göhrde State Forest was decimated by the return of the wolf and might eventually die out locally.  Behaviour  European mouflon usually form small herds with an older ewe as the leader. Rams often form separate groups outside the rutting season. During the rutting season, the rams fight over the ewes, especially by ramming each other with their curved horns, in order to push their rivals away. European mouflon are herbivores and eat a wide range of food. They also debark trees and seriously hinder tree growth. Their rutting season is in October/November; the gestation period is about five months, and birthing takes place in March/April. One or two lambs are born, the suckling time is about six months. The escape behaviour of European mouflon is adapted to their actual high mountain habitat: in case of danger, they flee to inaccessible rock faces. In the lowlands, they can only escape short distances and become easy prey for pursuers.  History  It is unclear whether the European mouflon became largely extinct in Europe as a result of its habitats being cut off and through over-hunting between 3,000 and 4,000 years ago and survived only in Corsica and Sardinia, or whether it was only introduced into the Mediterranean basin in prehistoric times. According to some zoologists, the European mouflon is not a genuine game species, but a descendant of a very early race of domestic sheep. In fact, there are strong indications that European mouflon came to Corsica and Sardinia only some 7,000 years ago along with Neolithic peoples, since no traces can be found from earlier times. Over the last 200 years, European mouflon have been kept in various places in Europe. Prince Eugene of Savoy kept mouflon in his Viennese wildlife park, some of which were transferred to the Lainz Wildlife Park. In 1840, another 19 specimens were imported from Corsica and Sardinia. After 20 years of gamekeeping, as many as sixty rams were able to be shot as game, and there were similar experiences with animals that were later reared for game in Hungary, Bohemia, and Silesia. From the beginning of the 20th century, mouflon were introduced directly from Sardinia and Corsica as park and game animals in Germany. Here, above all, the Hamburg merchant, Oscar Louis Tesdorpf, was instrumental in driving forward their naturalisation. The first specimens were released into the Göhrde State Forest in 1903, the next ones in Harzgerode in 1906, followed by further releases in the Taunus and the Solling. In all cases, the mouflon favoured level or low-lying plains with forest cover and not, as expected, rocky, mountainous areas. Gradually they were mixed with varieties of domestic sheep, especially crossbreeding with the racka. After the European mouflon population declined during the First World War, in the German Reich alone about 2,500 were counted in 1938.Ludwig Zukowsky: Aus Wald und Flur. Tiere unserer Heimat; Cigaretten-Bilderdienst Hamburg-Bahrenfeld, 1939 After a further decline during the Second World War, the number of European mouflon worldwide in 1954 was only about 4,500. After that, numbers recovered due to careful management and grew to about 20,000 in 1967. At that time there were 7,000 in Germany, over 2,000 in Austria, and 2,000 in Hungary and Czechoslovakia.D. Müller Using in Grzimeks Tierleben, 1968. In the Bavarian Forest, mouflon were naturalised from 1971 to 1974 on the southern side of the forest, with the aid of the Wittelsbach Compensation Fund. At times, the population grew to almost 100 animals. By early 2008, it fell again due to tourism, hunting and the newly released lynx leaving just over 30 mouflon in the area of the Geisskopf.Das Mufflon ist selten geworden; Der Bayerwald-Bote (Passauer Neue Presse), No. 15, 18 January 2008 In January 1969 in Luxembourg, several mouflon from the Grand Ducal park at Imbringen in the Grunewald (where mouflon had been kept since 1905), were brought to the state enclosure at Kaundorf in the Ösling. They were released in 1970 and spread to the Obersauer region. There are also mouflon in the area of Hosingen (Ösling) and especially in the canton of Echternach (Gutland).F. Adam: Muffelwild in Luxembourg. Ettelbruck, April 2003, Lycée technique agricole, 54 pp. (unpublished).  Current distribution  In Corsica and Sardinia the European mouflon was endangered by hunting and poaching. Only strict regulation and resettlements appear to have slowly stabilized the population. In Corsica, where hunting for mouflon has been prohibited since 1953, there were only about 180 in 1967, but by the 2010 the population had grown to 800. In Sardinia, the numbers in 1955 were around 700, but in 1967 this had fallen to just 300. Through protection programmes, the population rose however to over 1,000 in 1980. In 2015 there were an estimated 6,000 mouflon in Sardinia.Sardegna Foreste: Censimento del muflone: report 2015 The relatively low numbers in Corsica contrast with the rest of the current range of the mouflon. Today the largest numbers live in the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary and Austria and there are still large populations in France, Slovakia, Serbia, Croatia and Bulgaria. In the introduced populations of Central Europe it is estimated that there are over 60,000 mouflon (in 2005 there were 90,000), the largest population being in the Czech Republic (17,500). The population in Germany was around 15,600 animals in 2010 (c. 20,600 in 2005) living in about 120 groups.Former distribution figures according to Müller-Using in Grzimek's Tierleben; more recent ones from In Hungary there are around 10,600 and in Austria about 7,500 mouflon (no herds in Vorarlberg).Muffelwild, retrieved 28 July 2017 In the early 1980s, mouflon migrated from France to the Swiss canton of Valais, where there are now two colonies with a population of around 200 animals. The IUCN considers the European mouflon as feral populations of ancient domestic livestock, therefore doesn't provide an assessment for this species conservation status.  Hunting  Mouflon have a well-developed vision and can recognize a human at a range of over 1,000 metres, unlike deer which rely mainly on smell. Despite their small size and weight, mouflon are very hard to kill and have to be hunted with weapons of sufficiently high calibre in order to ensure successful first- time kills. = Germany = In Germany the hunting of mouflon is governed by hunting rights in accordance with the Federal Hunting Act. In the 2015/16 hunting season the bag in Germany amounted to 8,000 mouflon (in 2010/11 there were 7,270), of which 3,000 were shot in Rhineland-Palatinate and Thuringia alone, 38% of the total cull.Jahresstrecke Muffelwild, accessed July 28, 2017. The numbers shot have remained almost constant for over ten years. The relatively high cull compared to the overall population arises from the need to keep wildlife damage under control as well as to ensure a healthy population. = Austria = In the 2015/16 hunting season, the total numbers culled in Austria came to 2,450 mouflon (in 2014/15 it was 2,640), of which 885 were shot in Lower Austria alone, corresponding to 36 per cent of the total cull.Jagdstatistik 2015/16, retrieved 28 July 2017  References  Literature  * Holger Piegert, Walter Uloth: Der Europäische Mufflon.

The battle was part of the 1516–17 war between the Ottoman Empire and the Mamluk Sultanate, which ended in an Ottoman victory and conquest of much of the Middle East, bringing about the destruction of the Mamluk Sultanate. The Ottoman victory in this battle gave Selim's armies control of the entire region of Syria and opened the door to the conquest of Egypt.  Battle preparations  Sultan Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri spent the winter of 1515 and the spring of 1516 preparing an army he proposed leading to the disturbed confines of Asia Minor. Before beginning the march, an embassy arrived from Selim I promising in friendly terms to agree to Mamluk requests to appoint an Egyptian vassal to the Beylik of Dulkadir – a long-standing buffer state between Mamluks and Ottomans – and to reopen the frontier to the traffic of goods and slaves. On 18 May Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri set out from Cairo with a large force, appointed well in all respects but artillery. Portrait of Selim I by Konstantin Kapıdağlı Leaving Al-Ashraf Tuman bay II in control of Cairo, the sultan and his army marched north with great pomp, accompanied by music, singing, and festivity. The host included fifteen high ranking Emirs of a Thousand, 5,000 of his own royal Mamluks, and militia conscripts, and was supplemented during the march by additional Syrian and Bedouin contingents. High officers of state, the Abbasid caliph Al-Mutawakkil III, sheikhs, and courtiers, together with muezzins, physicians, and musicians, followed in his train. On the way, al-Ghawri also received Ahmed, son of the late pretender to the Ottoman throne (Selim I's nephew), and brought him along with courtly honors in the hope of drawing over his sympathizers from the Ottoman force. Advancing slowly Al-Ashraf Qansuh al- Ghawri entered Damascus on 9 June, with carpets spread in his pathway, while European merchants scattered gold to the crowd. After a few days' stay, advancing at a leisurely pace, he was received at Homs and Hama with festivities, moving towards Aleppo. Portrait of Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri, by Paolo Giovio (1483–1552) Meanwhile, another embassy arrived from the Ottoman camp which, under the pretense of peace, brought lavish presents to the Sultan, the Caliph Al-Mutawakkil III, and his vizier. These gifts were accompanied by a request from Selim I for a supply of Egyptian sugar and confectionery. The envoy intimated that problems with the Shah of Persia Ismail I had forced him again to prepare for war and take the field. The chancellor Mughla Bey was sent back with counter-gifts, but by the time he reached the Ottoman camp, Selim I had thrown off his ruse of peace. The Ottomans scorned the embassy and sent the chancellor back with his head and beard shaved and riding a lame mount.  Betrayal in the Mamluk camp  At Aleppo, the Mamluk governor Khai'r Bey had secretly sided with the Porte. Though the governor of Damascus had disclosed this to the sultan, he discredited the information. To veil his treachery, Khai'r Bey gave al-Ghawri a splendid reception, but the inhabitants were enraged against the Mamluks by their behavior in the city. It was at this point that Mughla Bey made his miserable return, reporting that Selim and his forces were advancing against them. With this immediate threat thrust upon them, the emirs, qadis, and royal Mamluks renewed their oaths of loyalty to the sultan. Al-Ghawri also distributed gifts to his personal forces, which displeased the other Mamluks. The sultan, dissuaded by the emir Janberdi al-Ghazali, ignored a final warning about Khai'r Bey's disloyalty before taking to the field.  Battle  The battle between the Ottoman and Mamluk armies. The Mamluk army advanced and on 20 August made camp at the plain of Marj Dabiq, a day's journey north of Aleppo. There, al-Ghawri and his men awaited the enemy's approach on this plain, where the sultanate's fate would soon be decided. According to the History of Egypt composed by Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad ibn Iyas, the Mamluks arranged themselves with the Sultan occupying the center column. Sibay, the Governor of Damascus, commanded the right flank, and Khai'r Bey, governor of Aleppo, took the left. The marshal Sûdûn Adjami was the first to enter combat, followed by Sibay, leading an experienced corps of veteran Mamluk warriors. They rushed into battle and managed to kill several thousand Turkish soldiers in the first hours of fighting. This advantage forced the opposite Ottoman wing to begin a withdrawal, and the Mamluk forces under Sibay succeeded in taking several pieces of artillery and capturing some fusiliers. Selim considered retreat or requesting a truce. It was at this point that the battle turned against the Mamluks. A rumor began to spread that al-Ghawri had ordered the recruits to hold their position, avoid combat, and leave the fighting to the veteran soldiers who were already engaged in battle. When Marshall Sûdûn Adjami and Sibay, who were leading the attack, were suddenly killed, panic broke out in the Mamluks' advancing right flank. Meanwhile, Khai'r Bey, in command of the left flank, called for a retreat. The fact that his forces were the first to quit the field was considered evidence of the man's betrayal. Ibn Iyas offered the following account of the Mamluk defeat: Mamluk heavy cavalry, circa 1550 Accounts vary, however, as to how exactly Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri met his end. Khai'r Bey may have spread a report of his death to precipitate the Egyptians' rout. According to one version of the battle, the sultan was found alive on the field and his head cut off and buried to prevent its falling into the enemy's hands. The Ottoman account relates that he was beheaded by a Turkish soldier, whom Selim initially insisted on executing but later pardoned. The Egyptian historian Ibn Iyas, by comparison, wrote that there were some who said he had died of a ruptured gallbladder and others who said he had poisoned himself.  Aftermath  Selim I, welcomed by the inhabitants as a deliverer from the excesses of the Mamluks, entered Aleppo in triumph. He received the Abbasid caliph warmly, but upbraided the Islamic judges and jurists for their failure to check Mamluk misrule. Joined by Khai'r Bey and other Egyptian officers, he proceeded to the Citadel. From Aleppo he marched with his forces to Damascus, where terror prevailed. Beyond some attempts to protect the city by flooding the plain around, the remnants of the Mamluk forces had done nothing substantial to oppose the enemy. Discord amongst the emirs had paralyzed the army, preventing any decisive action that might have affected the subsequent course of events. Some of al-Ghawri's lieutenants supported the emir Janberdi Al-Ghazali as the new sultan, while others favored the deceased ruler's son. As the Ottomans approached, however, resistance dissolved as remaining forces either went over to the Turkish side or fled to Egypt. Selim I entered Damascus in mid-October, and the inhabitants readily surrendered to the conquerors. Ottoman control, despite being jeopardized by periodic revolts, was to last almost three centuries.

John Godfrey studied with Oliver Knussen at the Royal College of Music, Peter Maxwell Davies at the Dartington Summer School and with Richard Orton at the University of York, where he graduated with a BA Hons in music (1983) and an MPhil in composition (1989). In 1989 he and another York graduate, James Poke, formed the new-music group Icebreaker, which went on to become one of the most successful ensembles in its field, appearing extensively in Europe and America. The group made several CDs for Decca Argo, New Tone and Donemus, which include John's works Euthanasia and Garden Instruments, S U S Y W I M P S and \\"Gallows Hill\\", as well as his arrangements of Diderik Wagenaar's Metrum and Steve Martland's Shoulder to Shoulder. John appears as a performer on all Icebreaker's CDs up to and including Rogue's Gallery. In 1997, John was invited to join the Crash Ensemble. It quickly became Ireland's foremost and most adventurous new-music ensemble, and has performed not only frequently in Dublin but also throughout Ireland, Sweden, Germany, Holland, Canada, Australia and the USA. John and UCC-graduate Sarah O'Halloran ran the 2008 Quiet Music Festival, at which the group the Quiet Music Ensemble was founded. The group performed new works by Alvin Lucier, Pauline Oliveros, David Toop, Mark Applebaum, Karen Power and Juraj Kos, all of whom were present. The Festival also included the first Deep Listening Retreat in Ireland. In 2009, the QME performed the closing night of that year's Dublin Electronic Arts Festival, with guest David Toop. Recent compositions include Call of the Carolina Parakeet (2005), for Crash Ensemble, which received its premiere in Cork in spring 2005 and for David Adams (2005), for organ, as well as a number of soundscapes, including \\"Hermaphrodite\\" for the CruX Dance Company, and The Abstract Despotisms of Calculus for Crash Ensemble. John's particular compositional influences include minimalists and post-minimalists, the most formative being, perhaps, Louis Andriessen and the Hague School. He has particular interests in work that exhibits Cage's idea that certain kinds of new music are about \\"perception, and the arousal of it in us\\". He is fascinated with the analytical concept of depth-coherence in music - and, intermittently, other forms of human endeavour - and with performance, most especially the performance of contemporary music.

Ramirez, 418 U.S. 24 (1974), is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that held that convicted felons could be barred from voting without violating the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Such felony disenfranchisement is practiced in a number of U.S. states. Facts Plaintiffs, who had been convicted of felonies and had completed their sentences, brought a class action against California's Secretary of State and election officials, challenging a state constitutional provision and statutes that permanently disenfranchised anyone convicted of an “infamous crime,” unless the right to vote was restored by court order or executive pardon. Typically in voting rights cases, states must show that the voting restriction is necessary to a “compelling state interest,” and is the least restrictive means of achieving the state's objective. In this case, the plaintiffs argued that the state had no compelling interest to justify denying them the right to vote. The California Supreme Court agreed that the law was unconstitutional. On appeal, however, the U.S. Supreme Court said that a state does not have to prove that its felony disenfranchisement laws serve a compelling state interest. Decision The Supreme Court ruled 6–3 that California's law was constitutional. The majority opinion was written by Justice William Rehnquist. The Court relied on Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which calls for reducing representation in the U.S. House of Representatives for any state that denies the right to vote to its voters (a provision designed to prevent the Southern states from disenfranchising black citizens after the Civil War). But Section 2 makes an exception for denying voting rights to citizens because of \\"participation in rebellion, or other crimes.\\" The Court said that this distinguishes felony disenfranchisement from other forms of voting restrictions, which must be narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests in order to be constitutional. The Court also reviewed the legislative history of Section 2, and relied as well on the fact that when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted in 1868, over half of the U.S. states allowed denying the right to vote to \\"persons convicted of felonies or infamous crimes.\\" See also * Burger Court * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 418 * Hunter v.

The distance between the first line of defences ranged from 200 to 600 meters. Sri Lankan soldiers captured the 1st Forward Defence Line (FDL) between Muhamalai and Kilali at around 05:00 on 20 November 2008, pushing the LTTE lines 800m southward.Map.  History  Although wider than the Nagarcoil Forward Defence Line, it was very difficult for either of the fighting forces to advance through enemy defence lines and attack the enemy bunkers, due to the topography. For several years the line was the most active front in the Sri Lankan Civil War, but throughout hundreds of battles the defence positions hardly moved either way. In almost all cases, the side trying to overrun enemy defence lines suffered heavy casualties. The Muhamalai FDL had strategic importance due to its location on the Kandy-Jaffna Highway. If the SLA took control of Muhamalai, they would obtain a crucial land supply route. The LTTE had around 1,800 militiamen in Muhamalai and Nagarcoil, and the SLA forces numbered several thousand. Elephant Pass, another strategic location, lay to the south of Muhamalai. Unlike the other FDLs north of Mannar (where large numbers of Eastern and Mannar Tamils were stationed) and Southern Vanni, LTTE cadres in these two FDLs consist mostly of Jaffna Tamils. LTTE positions. For several years Muhamalai FDL was the most active FDL in the Sri Lankan Civil War, despite being static for the entire time, and a large proportion of the war's casualties occurred there.  2008 Offensive  On 21 April 2008, the SLA launched a major offensive towards Muhamalai FDL supported by tanks and artillery. The SLA overran the LTTE cadres' first line of defence, forcing them to withdraw to their second line of defence, but the LTTE forces engaged in heavy mortar and RPG fire from their new positions towards the weakly defended former first line of defence, where SLA troops became trapped. Around 15 SLA soldiers and 52 LTTE militiamen died in the attack, according to Defencenet, and 176 SLA soldiers and 25 militiamen died according to the LTTE. The army claimed that their forward defence line was extended by 500 meters after the battle, but the Tamils refuted this claim and published pictures of dead soldiers lying in the bunkers in the first line of defence. As of 24 April 2008, the SLA have so far handed over six bodies of dead militiamen, and LTTE have handed over 28 soldiers' bodies to the Red Cross. For the past seven years, the SLA tried several times to break through the Kilali-Muhamalai- Nagarkovil defence line and reach Elephant Pass, the gateway to the Vanni, but every time it had to retreat, suffering heavy losses in men and material (especially armoured carriers and tanks). The geography of Muhamalai worked against the SLA but suited the well-entrenched LTTE. The battle field lay in a narrow isthmus in between sections of the Jaffna Lagoon. The location allowed no room for manoeuvre, making the place a death trap, unsuitable for tanks, which led to the SLA losing a large number of tanks to anti-tank fire. The LTTE not only mined the area extensively, sometimes using the powerful Monster mine to blow up tanks, but also dug trenches and large pits, and camouflaged them so that troops, armour and vehicles would fall into them. The Tigers typically avoided man-to-man fighting in this narrow area so as not to get trapped themselves, but used long distance weapons like mortars and artillery. Stories of battles in the Muhamalai sector followed a pattern: on 25 April 2001, the 52, 53 and 55 Divisions fought their way through to occupy two square kilometres of LTTE-held territory in the Kilali-Eluthumaduval sector, but had to retreat in disarray after a 72-hour-long battle, losing 300 to 500 men. The LTTE had allowed them to get into a cul-de-sac only to attack them from three sides. In October 2006, there was another SLA attempt to break through Muhamalai, but the well-entrenched LTTE thwarted the move and destroyed or damaged six armoured vehicles, four T-55 tanks and two BMPs, and killed 130 SLA soldiers. The focus of the conflict subsequently shifted from the Northern Defense Lines to other fronts, mainly the Mannar front, where the SLA successfully routed the LTTE, liberating extensive zones. As a result, the SLA adopted guerrilla tactics to deal with the LTTE presence in Jaffna, with extensive and successful use of sniper and hit and run tactics.

Klinkowström was born in Ludwigsburg in Swedish Pomerania to Friedrich Ernst Sebastian von Klinkowström (1735–1821) and Anna Louise Wilhelmine von Rosenberg (1751–1823). He began studying at the University of Greifswald, but, in deference to the wishes of his father, a lieutenant-colonel in the Swedish army, Friedrich served in the Prussian Army from 1793 to 1802. After this he was allowed to follow his own inclination and become a painter. To perfect himself in his studies, he went to the famous Dresden Gallery. His early pictures as well showed a strong leaning towards the Roman Catholic Church. After four years of successful study he was called home and obliged to remain there quietly for two years, owing to the depressed political condition of the country after the Battle of Jena. Then he decided to head for Rome, journeying first through Paris where the victorious Napoleon had amassed art treasures from many lands. His stay in Paris lasted nearly two years, and terminated with his engagement. Finally in 1810 he started for Rome. But the quickly formed friendship with Thorvaldsen, Rauch, Overbeck, and other artists, only lasted a year, as Klinkowström was obliged to look about for an assured position. This led him to Vienna to take a place as instructor, and his marriage followed in 1812. But the grave political situation after the Battle of Leipzig led the quiet artist once again to join the army. He participated in the Landwehr in Leipzig, Dresden, and Aachen. After the Treaty of Paris he returned to Vienna, where he found that during his absence his wife had been received into the Roman Catholic Church by Father Klemens Hofbauer. When he was told of this, he exclaimed: \\"So Louise has become a Catholic before me.\\" A few months after this he followed the example of his \\"dear Louise\\". Then there came three quiet years of painting and literary work. He devoted himself particularly to children's books for which he provided designs and illustrations. There had been a plan under discussion for some time in Vienna to found a school for the sons of the higher nobility. But the difficulty was to find the right man, one qualified to undertake the work and carry it out within the provisions of the Austrian School Laws. With Klinkowström as its leader, the new foundation was opened in 1818, and enjoyed the personal favour of Emperor Francis I of Austria, the fact that the empress also showed an active interest in it naturally lent additional prestige to the school. Owing to ill-health and increasing suffering, Klinkowström was obliged in 1834, after sixteen years of personal guidance, to give over the schools to other hands. He died six months after this, his wife having died before him, in 1821. Both of his oldest and youngest sons, Joseph and Max, entered the Jesuit Order, and became renowned preachers. The third son, Klemens, the head of the house in Austria, acquired as Imperial and Royal Archivist a literary fame, while the fourth son, Alphons, produced a biography of his father. The only daughter joined the Order of Salesians after her father's death.

They were originally doughnut-shaped boats with an underwater seat in the \\"hole.\\" Still, modern designs include a V-shape with pontoons on either side and the seat raised above the water allowing the legs of the angler to be the only part of the body to be submerged. Float tubes are used for many aspects of fishing, such as flyfishing for trout or lure fishing for largemouth bass, and enable the angler to fish areas otherwise not fishable from the bank. Float tubes are either \\"U\\", \\"V\\"-shaped, or circular. A standard float tube consists of an inflated bladder inside a sewn cover providing the seat, reserve air compartments, and tackle storage pockets. Many float tube anglers customize their crafts with rod holders, lights, and electronic fish finders. Details pike The angler generally wears stocking foot chest waders and scuba diving flippers, so the legs remain dry. Seated in the float tube, the angler paddles across the water with a gentle movement of the flippers then remains still over the chosen fishing ground. An alternative to diving flippers is the \\"paddle-pusher\\" or \\"duck fins.\\" These fins strap onto the angler's feet and have paddles situated on the outsides of the ankles. The paddles fold back when the leg moves forward and open when the leg moves back, allowing anglers to move forward in a somewhat less efficient but more natural walking-type motion. The competitive side of float tubing for bass is growing with the American Sonoma County Belly Boat Bass Club and The Bass Challenge in South Africa,The Bass Challenge which offers a tournament trail called the Kickboat Bass Challenge. Safety Anglers fishing from a float tube may wear a personal flotation device (a requirement in some locations), as float tubes are susceptible to punctures. Additionally, most manufacturers do not recommend using float tubes in moving waters, such as rivers or streams.

History  The history of the higher medical school in Kharkiv is more than 200 years long and closely connected with the history of V. N. Karazin Kharkiv National University, because it sprang from its Medical Faculty. The University was founded in 1805, a decree about its foundation was signed by the Russian Tsar Alexander I, and the first Statutes of the University were approved at that time. In the 19th century, widely known doctors and scientists taught at the medical faculty of the university and worked in practical medicine. It was them who, for the first time in the Russian Empire, performed operations of ovariotomy, total resection of the stomach, operations on the open heart, as well as made significant scientific discoveries. In 1887, a special building was erected for the anatomical theatre of the Medical Faculty (now it houses the Department of Human Anatomy of our higher school); in 1896, four independent University clinics were built, namely: therapeutic, surgical, obstetrical and ophthalmological. In 1910, the Kharkov Medical Society, which was created on the initiative of professors of the Medical faculty, founded the Women's Medical Institute, where higher education was given to women. In 1920 the Medical Faculty of Kharkiv University was united with the Women's Medical Institute, and Kharkiv Medical Academy was founded; one year later the latter was given another name: Kharkiv Medical Institute. Among its teachers there were a lot of outstanding pedagogues and scientists; streets of the City of Kharkiv were named after some of them. These are: physiologist Danilevsky V.Ya., surgeon Trinkler N.P., anatomist Vorobyov V.P., ophthalmologist Girschman L.L., therapeutist Frankovsky V.A. Many research institutes, hospitals and clinics were founded on initiatives of lecturers of KhNMU. These are, in particular, the Institute of General and Emergency Surgery, Malaya Institute of Therapy, Shapoval Regional Clinical Centre of Urology and Nephrology, etc. They became the basis for scientific and medical work of our University Departments in these fields. In 1951, the University started training of foreign students. By now, the University has trained more than 3,600 specialists for different countries of the world. In 1994, by a Decision of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, Kharkiv Medical Institute served as the basis for founding Kharkiv State Medical University; the latter received the highest 4th category by results of its accreditation and fully justifies it today. In 2007 the University received the National status.  Museum  The Museum of History of Kharkiv National Medical University was founded in 1968. It is located in the Main Building of the University and occupies 120 sq.m. The total number of the museum exhibits exceeds 5,000 pieces. In 2011, by an order of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of Ukraine the Museum of History of KhNMU was awarded the title “The Perfect Museum” for its significant contribution to the cause of education of young pupils and students, increase of the national culture, preservation of the historic heritage of the Ukrainian people and of the Museum Fund of Ukraine, popularization of monuments of history, culture and nature. The Museum exhibitions display documents and articles, which make it possible to follow more than 200 years of the history of the higher medical school in Kharkiv. In particular, these are books, theses, diplomas, albums, medical instruments, photographs and other exhibits. The Museum is open for excursions accompanied by a lecturer from 9.00 a.m. till 4.00 p.m. Rankings and Reputation The university ranks 560 out of 11,000 universities in the world.

After completing his novitiate and the study of rhetoric and philosophy, he taught for three years in the lower forms of the Gymnasium.

On his return to Graz he taught rhetoric, and subsequently, during the confusion caused by the revolution of 1848, held the position of tutor in a noble Westphalian family. When, two years later, a popular missionary movement began in Germany, Klinkowström was allotted to the German missionaries and proved himself to be efficient. He continued his efforts in Austria in 1852, and his sermons in Vienna led the emperor to express a desire to see him. The result of the interview was the establishment of a Jesuit community in Vienna. Here from 1859 to 1872, in which year his strength began to fail, Klinkowström continued his preaching activity.

Biography  The Video Area that Morton founded was the first department in the United States to offer college degrees in Video art, through the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. The Video Area eventually became the Video Department, which later became part of the Film, Video & New Media Department. Frequent visitors and collaborators in the Video Area during the 1970s included Steina and Woody Vasulka, Gene Youngblood, Dan Sandin, Timothy Leary, Barbara Buckner and many other active and founding members of the early Video art community. Morton introduced analog and digital computers into the curriculum of the Video Area and the School in the 1970s through the use of the Sandin Image Processor, a patch- programmable analog computer optimized for video processing and synthesis developed from 1971 - 1973, and The Bally Astrocade Arcade Video Game System, a programmable home video game console developed in 1974. Morton's playful, critical, self-reflexive and conversational Video art works, projects and performances often involved ongoing collaborations. In particular, Morton collaborated extensively with artists Jane Veeder, Dan Sandin, Tom DeFanti and Jamie Fenton. = Copy-it-right = In 1973, Morton asked Dan Sandin if he could build the first copy of Sandin's original Sandin Image Processor. Sandin and Morton then began to work together to create the schematic plans for the Sandin Image Processor, a document they called the Distribution Religion. Through The Distribution Religion, Sandin open sourced his Sandin Image Processor, giving the plans away for only the cost of making Xerox copies and mailing them while incorporating any additions or modifications made by those who built their own Sandin Image Processor into any further releases of the Distribution Religion. Morton developed an approach he called COPY-IT-RIGHT, an anti-copyright approach to making and freely sharing Media art. The Distribution Religion and Morton's individual and collaborative Media art works were released under his COPY-IT-RIGHT license. COPY-IT-RIGHT encouraged people to make faithful copies, caring for and distributing the work as widely as possible. Exhibitions During his life, Morton's Video art works were exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art (New York), the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, the Iverson Museum of Art (New York) and the 1975 São Paulo Art Biennial (Brazil). His Video art works were also shown on television stations such as WNET (New York), WGBH (Boston) and WTTW (Chicago) and reviewed in magazines such as Artforum and New Art Examiner. In 2007 the \\"Distribution Religion\\" exhibition at The Art Gallery of Knoxville was inspired by and featured the work of Phil Morton.  Legacy  The Phil Morton Memorial Research Archive (located in the Film, Video & New Media Department at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago) seeks to coordinate and freely distribute Phil Morton's Media art work and associated research under Morton's COPY-IT-RIGHT license. jonCates initiated the Phil Morton Memorial Research Archive in 2007 after receiving a generous donation of Phil Morton's personal video archive/database from Morton's surviving partner Barb Abramo. The Film, Video & New Media Department presented \\"COPY-IT-RIGHT! Selections from The Phil Morton Memorial Research Archive\\" at The Gene Siskel Film Center on Thursday, February 15, 2007. The program included excerpts from Morton's \\"General Motors\\" and the complete works of \\"Program # 9 (Amateur TV)\\" by Morton and Veeder and \\"SAIC Memo\\". Morton's work still maintains relevance and importance for the history of New Media. General Motors in 2018 was exhibited at the Chicago New Media 1973-1992 exhibition, curated by jonCates. A lot of the videos he collected in the Video Data Bank archive was also included in the exhibition.

He was a disc jockey who was a pioneer of \\"free form\\" radio. Hawthorne was born in Victor, Colorado, and began his career at a Denver radio station. He gained national attention for his broadcasts on Pasadena, California, station KXLA in 1947. While in Los Angeles, he also worked in early television and short films. He also issued his own records such as \\"Turn Your Head, Sweetheart\\". Hawthorne moved to Hawaii in the late 1960s and developed the popular Checkers and Pogo children's show, which ran from 1967 to 1982 (long after he passed the role of \\"Checkers\\" to other actors). In 1950, he created, produced and starred in the Saturday night coast-to-coast radio program, The Hawthorne Thing, which was the final network radio show to originate in NBC's Hollywood Radio City. At KLAC/Channel 13 in the early 1950s, he created the first late evening talk show on television, This Is Hawthorne. An article in the LA Times reflecting on early TV described the show as \\"predecessor of NBC's Saturday Night Live.\\" On KNBH/Channel 4, beginning in 1952, he did a daily five-minute weather show. In 1958, Jim traveled to KYA-San Francisco and created Voice Your Choice, which he brought to KDAY. In the early 1960s, while doing Instant Weather on KTTV/Channel 11, Hawthorne joined KFWB as assistant PD and morning DJ, and eventually became VP, National Program Manager for Crowell-Collier Broadcasting. While still at KFWB he joined Sherman Grinberg Productions as a writer, producer, narrator. He produced Jim Hawthorne's Funny World and Quicky Quiz television comedy shorts. In 1965, \\"ol Weather Eyes\\" moved to Honolulu to \\"retire\\" and ended up creating the Checkers and Pogo kids show for TV which ran for 11 years. He was also involved with programming KGMB -Honolulu and was creative consultant to morning legend Aku. As one of his bits, since the TV weather was so short, he would hold up cards and do a pantomime. He was elected president of the newly formed Disc Jockey Association in 1960. In 1970, Hawthorne moved back to his hometown, Denver, to help his ailing mother. He stayed for 11 years and established a very successful career at KOA, eventually becoming GM. In the late 1980s, Hawthorne returned to Southern California. Hawthorne continued to entertain in semi-retirement. On November 6, 2007, he died of congestive heart disease at age 88 in Santa Barbara, California.

He began his career with Queens Park Rangers before joining his hometown team Cardiff City. However, he suffered from drug and alcohol addiction and was given a two-year suspended ban by the Football Association of Wales after testing positive for a class A drug. Continued disciplinary problems eventually led to his release from Cardiff. He later played for numerous clubs in the Welsh Premier League and lower divisions.

He spent time with the London-based club as a schoolboy before joining Queens Park Rangers on a YTS scheme at the age of thirteen. He made his debut on February 1999 against Watford, but problems began to arise nearly as soon as he became a professional when he disappeared for over a week when he was meant to be reporting for Wales under-21 duty. However, manager Gerry Francis revealed that it was not the first time the youngster had gone missing, stating \\"We've covered up for Leon enough now. This is not a one off.\\" Francis also commented that Jeanne was on his last chance at the club after being arrested for drink-driving the previous year. He left QPR in 2001 to sign for his hometown club Cardiff City in the hope of ending his disciplinary problems. The transfer was arranged by Jeanne's agent John Fashanu who had worked with Cardiff chairman Sam Hammam at his former club Wimbledon and described how Hammam had been a positive influence over him and hoped that he could do the same for Jeanne. However, just weeks after joining, he tested positive for a class A drug and was handed a two-year suspended sentence by the Football Association of Wales. The FAW also stipulated that Jeanne should undergo an education programme to help him learn to read and write and find a family to live with, eventually moving into the home of former Cardiff player Ronnie Bird. In January 2002, he was named in the starting line-up for a 3–0 victory over Newtown in the FAW Premier Cup, scoring his side's first goal of the match with a header.

In May 2002 Jeanne was selected for random drugs testing and sent his sample away but the results came back only to show that the sample he had submitted was not urine. He refused to provide a second sample which led to Cardiff terminating his contract and he left the club. On the morning of the drugs test, Jeanne had agreed a new contract with the club but this was revoked following the incident. =Non-league= After his release from Cardiff he attempted a comeback with Havant & Waterlooville in a pre-season friendly against League of Wales side Barry Town but was withdrawn from playing after officials at Barry questioned if he was allowed to play at which point it was revealed that he was currently banned from playing football.\\"Jeanne's comeback spiked\\" BBC Sport Retrieved on 9 January 2008 He was allowed to resume playing a short while later and enjoyed a prosperous spell at Port Talbot Town but yet again he was involved in a scandal.

Once a commune of its own, Binic is now part of the commune of Binic-Étables-sur-Mer, following a merger on March, 01, 2016.http://www.cotes- darmor.gouv.fr/content/download/19852/140463/file/Recueil%20sp%C3%A9cial%20n%C2%B012%20du%2018%20f%C3%A9vrier%202016.pdf The name is derived from the Breton prefix pen (meaning head, chief, end or point) and the -ic suffix after the Ic river that runs through the village into the English Channel. Binic therefore stands for \\"the mouth of the river Ic\\". The town has several nicknames, including City of Spray and, more recently, The Beauty Spot of the Cotes d'Armor.https://www.brittanytourism.com/destinations/the-10-destinations/saint- brieuc-bay-paimpol-les-caps/binic-etables-sur-mer/ History The recorded history of Binic dates to the Neolithic period (between 3500 and 1800 BC). Megalithic monuments festoon the area, such as the dolmen of Margot's Table; this however was destroyed in 1816 during work on the port. In the Middle Ages, Binic (then called Benic) was a small village of no more than twenty houses. Despite its relatively small size, it was an appealing venue for fairs and markets and attracted people from the surrounding villages. In 1821, Binic was granted municipal status due to the lobbying efforts of François Le Saulnier de Saint Jouan, a prominent ship owner in Binic, with the support of the Duchess of Angoulême (1778-1851), daughter of Louis XVI. At this time the town had 1,611 inhabitants. The boundaries of Binic, separating it from the parish of Étables-sur-Mer, were not finalised until 1840. In the 19th century, Binic flourished. By 1845, it had become the most important French port for deep sea fishing. The port received 150 to 160 ships annually with activity divided between fishing in Newfoundland (island) and coastal trading vessels importing salt, wine, northern timber, flour and vegetables. At that time, Binic was the first cod fishing port. The early 20th century brought significant change for the municipality. The French government signed the Entente Cordiale in 1904 which, among many other matters, extinguished French claims to Newfoundland, ending the port's thriving days. Overfishing led to the collapse of the fisheries in 1992. Confronted with the threat of German submarines during World War I, the rising costs of weapons and increasingly stringent fishing regulations and competition from steam trawlers and schooners, ports of the region began to collapse. The depression in Binic lasted for thirty years, until new fishing methods arrived. Saint-Brieuc Bay developed a specialty in scallop fishing that caught on in Binic. In 1992, Binic trawlers began unloading their catch in the new port in the neighbouring town of Saint-Quay-Portrieux. The port became dedicated to yachting. Between 1906 and 1956, Binic was served by the railway department of Côtes-du-Nord (renamed Côtes-d'Armor in 1990), with a station on the esplanade of the Banche, built by engineer Briochain Louis Auguste Harel of Noah. The railroad left important traces in Binic including two viaducts; the railway bridge known as the Chien Noir or La Hasée viaduct, and viaduct Beaufeuillage, facing the artisanal zone, located both the along the D4 towards Lantic. On 1 March 2016, Binic and Étables-sur-Mer merged becoming one commune called Binic- Étables-sur-Mer. Population Inhabitants of Binic are called Binicais in French.

The game could have then proceeded for a good long time after that with Saemisch gaining some breathing space.

It represents the third largest system of its kind in Europe. The first set of fortifications was a tight defensive ring around central Poznań, including the main citadel called Fort Winiary (now the Cytadela park). Construction of these fortifications began in 1828. Later, beginning in 1876, an outer defensive ring was built around the perimeter of the city, consisting chiefly of a series of \\"forts\\", which mostly still survive. The term Festung Posen was also used by the Nazi German occupiers during the Red Army's advance in the closing phases of the Second World War, to refer to Poznań's status as one of the \\"strongholds\\" (Festungen) which were to be defended at all costs. It fell in the Battle of Poznań (1945), with Fort Winiary the last point of resistance.  Initial planning  Poznań (Posen) came under Prussian rule with the Second Partition of Poland in 1793. Its medieval city walls were obsolete by that time, and were mostly taken down in the early 19th century to facilitate the city's growth. The Prussian authorities first made plans to build new fortifications in December 1815.Biesiadka, Gawlak, Kucharski, Wojciechowski, p. 19 The city lay on the shortest route from the border with Congress Poland (and hence with the Russian Empire) to Berlin, and was also an important point on the route from West Prussia to Silesia; therefore, according to General Karl von Grolman, its fortification would show that Prussia had no intention of giving up those lands, and would defeat the \\"continuous intrigues and plotting\\" on the part of the Poles.Karl von Grolman's report of 22 May 1817 A preliminary plan sketched by Grolman on 9 July 1817 provided for fortification of Winiary Hill north of the city, as well as the area of St. Kazimierz's Church in Śródka to the east. Army engineers added to these plans a weir on the river Warta (Warthe), which would enable the river to be used as part of the defences.Biesiadka, Gawlak, Kucharski, Wojciechowski, p. 20 Building was planned to begin in 1817, but initially no funds were available for the work (due to the costs of fortifying Cologne and Koblenz). Planning continued, however: in 1823 Grolman proposed a line of defences surrounding the left-bank (main) portion of the city, with additional fortifications 500–1000 metres in front of the main line. In 1827, Johann von Brese, then working in the War Ministry's engineering section, was instructed to prepare a detailed plan. The result, dated 23 March 1828, included the large fort on Winiary Hill, fortifications on the cathedral island (Ostrów Tumski) and the right bank, and the core defensive line surrounding the left-bank city. The plan was approved by General Gustav von Rauch (chief inspector of forts), and then presented by General Karl von Hake to King Frederick William III, who approved it in principle, asking Rauch to make some improvements.Biesiadka, Gawlak, Kucharski, Wojciechowski, p. 21 These were agreed on 18 June 1828 by a committee of officers headed by Rauch, and then supplemented by Rauch himself (it was due to Rauch that Grolman's proposed additional line in front of the main defences was excluded from the plans). The king gave his final approval on 14 August 1828, ordering Hake to begin construction with the Winiary fort and the weirs on the Warta and on the Wierzbak (Wierzbach) stream.  Construction of the inner fortifications  Johann von Brese, architect of the fortifications On 14 March 1828 Captain Moritz von Prittwitz und Gaffron, who had been a member of Rauch's committee, was appointed chief of construction of Festung Posen. In May, he and five subordinate officers began marking out the outline of the first fortifications – the defensive barracks of the Winiary fort (later the reduit). Building began on 23 June 1828 (the fort would be completed in 1839). Fortification also soon began north of Poznań Cathedral and in the south-western part of the main defensive line. Work was carried out by the 5th Pioneers Division, re- stationed from Glogau (Głogów). Following the Polish November Uprising against Russia in 1830, the unfinished fortifications were manned temporarily for defensive purposes.Biesiadka, Gawlak, Kucharski, Wojciechowski, p. 22 In 1829–1832 the Große Schleuse weir was built on the Warta. In October 1832 the main stream of the Warta was moved westwards, the former stream being closed off with an overfall weir (Große Überfall), connected to a seven-span defensive bridge. In 1832–1837 the Kleine Schleuse on the Wierzbak was built.Biesiadka, Gawlak, Kucharski, Wojciechowski, p. 23 The Dom Schleuse weir on the east side of Ostrów Tumski was built in 1834–1838, with the Dom Flesche lunette to the north. On 1 October 1834 Festung Posen was classified as a \\"Fortress Second Class\\", and completed parts of the fortifications were armed. Around 1837–1838 the Magazin Cavalier and Ziegel Flesche were built south of Fort Winiary.Biesiadka, Gawlak, Kucharski, Wojciechowski, p. 24 Work also proceeded on the right bank, where there were to be two forts connected by embankments. The northern embankment, containing Bydgoszcz Gate, was completed in 1839. Ravelin I of Fort Winiary On 16 March 1839 the king ordered a renewal of work on the fortifications, which had been suspended. Brese produced working plans on 1 February 1840, and the king approved an annual budget of 300,000 talars. Work began again in March 1840, under a new director, Reichel (replaced by Lange in the 1850s).Biesiadka, Gawlak, Kucharski, Wojciechowski, p. 25 Bastions III and V were first to be built. Work was interrupted in 1848 due to the Greater Poland Uprising and \\"Spring of Nations\\". Later Bastions IV, VI, II and I were constructed, and in 1860–1861 connecting roads were built, as well as a number of brick blockhouses. This completed the ring (enceinte) around the left-bank city. Each of the six bastions had a large caponier shielded by embankments connected to the cavaliers. There was also a separate caponier on Grobla (Graben) island, beyond the Graben Schleuse weir.Biesiadka, Gawlak, Kucharski, Wojciechowski, p. 26 Work also continued on the right bank, with the Reformaten Fort completed in 1842, and the Warsaw Gate in 1845, as well as the Cybina Cavalier, Cybina Schleuse, Cybina Flesche, and Fort Rochus (and adjacent embankments) to the south. The section containing the Kalisz Gate was last to be built.Biesiadka, Gawlak, Kucharski, Wojciechowski, p. 27 Around 1850 it was decided to make an independent fortress on Ostrów Tumski. Canals were built east and west of the island, partly for flood prevention (Vorfluth Canal I and II), completed by 1864. Defences were built in the second half of the 1850s: Dom Redoute at the southern end of the island, embankments on the east and west sides of the island, and Dom Lünette in the north-west. Around 1862 the moat of Dom Redoute was completed. In 1864 the Poznań Fortress was declared completed and reclassified as a fortress \\"of the first class\\". King Wilhelm I issued a decree renaming many of the elements of the fortifications in honour of Prussian generals. Later alterations to the central ring of fortifications mainly resulted from the introduction of new types of armaments and ammunition, and the building of railway and tram lines.Biesiadka, Gawlak, Kucharski, Wojciechowski, p. 31 In 1869–1872 the north-eastern fortifications were rebuilt to allow the building of a railway to Toruń (Thorn). Powder stores were built and strengthened; in 1873–1874 the embankments around powder stores were widened. In 1875–1877 wooden bridges were mostly replaced with steel, and the gates in the fortifications were also strengthened. Ritter Thor was built in 1881–1882 to improve access to the city's new rail station. By the 1890s the outer ring of forts had been built around the perimeter of the city, and much of the inner ring began to be demolished (see below). However the main forts remained in use. In 1910 reinforcement work took place at Fort Winiary, Fort Steinäcker and Cavalier Aster. Elements of the left-bank fortifications Spezial-Kriegs- Laboratorium at Fort Winiary, now a military museum Blockhouse of Bastion Colomb on ul. Powstańców Wielkopolskich The following were the main elements of the ring of fortifications on the left bank of the Warta (listed in anti- clockwise order): *Fort Winiary. The main fort, lying north of the city as it was then, and popularly known as Poznań's citadel; converted after World War II into the Cytadela park. For details of its construction and history, see Poznań Citadel. *Kleine Schleuse (\\"Little Lock\\"), a weir built in 1832–1837 on the Wierzbak (Wierzbach) stream which flowed eastwards towards the Warta (this part of the stream is now combined with the Bogdanka and flows in underground drainage pipes). The weir was connected to the western end of Fort Winiary's reduit to the north, and to Fort Adalbert (Hake) to the south. *Fort Adalbert, renamed Fort Hake in 1864. Built in the 1830s on the north side of the hill containing St. Wojciech's (St. Adalbert's) church. *Ziegel Flesche (\\"Brick Lunette\\", named for a brickworks on the Wierzbak), later Waldersee Flesche, a lunette situated somewhat west of the fortifications running south from Fort Adalbert, being connected to them by a long gorge. Built in the late 1830s. *Magazin Cavalier, a fortified embankment between Fort Adalbert and Bastion VI, built 1837–1838. *Bastion VI, renamed Bastion Waldersee in 1864. It stood close to the junction of today's Al. Niepodległości and ul. Solna; the western line of fortifications generally follows today's Al. Niepodległości and ul. Kościuszki. Between Bastion VI and Bastion V was Cavalier VI (Cavalier Bonin from 1864). * Bastion V, renamed Bastion Tietzen in 1864, north of where the Zamek (\\"Imperial Castle\\") building now stands. Connected to Bastion IV by Cavalier V (Cavalier Stockhausen). To the west was an additional caponier close to the then railway station, now built in under the Rondo Kaponiera roundabout at the western end of Święty Marcin. * Bastion IV, renamed Bastion Colomb in 1864. Stood partly on the site of the park on ul. Powstańców Wielkopolskich west of Al. Niepodległości. A blockhouse survives; it was excavated and restored in 1998, and now houses a pub. Between Bastion IV and Bastion III was Cavalier IV (Cavalier Strotha). * Bastion III, renamed Bastion Grolman in 1864 and Reduta Przemysława after World War I. Connected to Bastion II by Cavalier III (Cavalier Rohr). It stood close to today's Plac Andersa. Bastions and Cavaliers I–III formed the southern edge of the fortifications, with a partial moat in front. * Bastion II, renamed Bastion Brünneck in 1864. Connected to Bastion I by Cavalier II (Cavalier Witzleben). * Bastion I, renamed Bastion Röder in 1864, close to the west bank of the Warta. Running east from it onto the then island of Grobla (Graben) was Cavalier I (Cavalier Boyen). *Graben Schleuse or Grabendamm, within Cavalier I, an overfall weir on the branch of the river west of Grobla. It regulated the water level in that branch and in the moat of the southern fortifications. Elements of the right-bank fortifications The following were the main elements of the fortifications on the right bank of the Warta: * Fort Rochus, renamed Fort Rauch in 1864, and Fort św. Rocha (later Reduta Marcinkowskiego) after World War I. It guarded the southern end of the right-bank fortifications, close to today's St. Roch bridge. There was a caponier to the west of the fort, on the river bank. The gunneries survived the demolitions in the 1920s. * Cybina Cavalier, renamed Cavalier Aster in 1864, on the south bank of the Cybina stream, near what is now the western end of Lake Malta. In 1869–1870 a powder store (no. 6) was built there, and in 1872 a powder laboratory. The cavalier was reinforced in 1910. * Cybina Flesche (Lünette), built 1845–1846, renamed Lünette Aster in 1864, and Reduta (Warownia) Rusa after World War I. Lay to the east of Cavalier Aster, in the area of today's Lake Malta. * Cybina Schleuse (\\"Cybina Lock\\"), on the Cybina by Cavalier Aster. The southern gate was filled in after World War II, but the northern one remains in use (it has been extended). It lies under ul. Jana Pawła II, and is visible when the river water level is low. * Reformaten Fort, renamed Fort Prittwitz-Gaffron in 1864, and Reduta (Warownia) Reformatów after World War I, completed 1842. Built on the hill next to the liquidated abbey by St. Kazimierz's Church in Śródka, on today's ul. Podwale. The lower floor of the reduit is still in existence. Fortifications on Ostrów Tumski Remains of Dom Schleuse The following were the main elements of the fortifications on Ostrów Tumski (the cathedral island): *Dom Schleuse (\\"Cathedral Lock\\"), a weir and bridge built in 1834–1838 on the eastern branch of the Warta (called Cybina). The lock was demolished after World War I, but the west bridgehead survives (on the eastern edge of Ostrów Tumski, close to the cathedral). *Nördlicher Dom Cavalier (\\"North Cathedral Cavalier\\"), completed in 1832, north of the cathedral. In 1861 a powder store was built, with a capacity of 51 tonnes. * Domwerk II (previously Hauptwerk No II or Dom Lünette), a fortified position at the western end of the North Cathedral Cavalier. *Fort Radziwill (originally Dom Redoute or Domwerk I), renamed Reduta (Warownia) Radziwiłła after World War I, built in the late 1850s at the southern end of Ostrów Tumski. It had a moat (completed in 1862). The fort survived the demolitions of the 1920s. *Dom Flesche, later Fort Steinäcker, a lunette some way north of the cathedral, built in the 1830s. In 1836 an embankment was made in front, also shielding a new access road. In the early 1870s the river's eastern branch (Cybina) was made to take a more northerly course, placing Fort Steinäcker on Ostrów Tumski. The fort was reinforced in 1910. After World War I it was renamed Reduta (Warownia) Lecha. *Fort Roon, built at the eastern end of the Great Lock (initially there was a smaller fort there, called Brückenkopf). It was renamed Reduta (Warownia) Czech after World War I. The reduit survives, situated on the site of the cogeneration plant in the north of Ostrów Tumski, and can be seen from the east bank of the Warta. *Große Schleuse (\\"Great Lock\\"), a weir also serving as a bridge, built on the main branch of the Warta in 1829–1832, just to the east of Fort Winiary. Later the weir gate was widened to allow larger ships to sail into the city. The weir was demolished after World War I, but the bridgeheads can still be seen. Gates Archangel Michael by Ludwig Stürmer, 1855, from the former Eichwald Thor (moved in 1908 to a school building on today's ul. Słowackiego) Berlin Gate - 1890 Gates had to be built to allow access into and out of the area enclosed by the ring of fortifications. The following four gates, in the northerly parts of the fortifications, were built in the 1830s: * Schillings Thor (known in Polish as Brama Szelągowska), between Fort Winiary and the Great Lock, on the road to the settlement of Szeląg (Schilling), now ul. Szelągowska. * Kirchhofs Thor (\\"Churchyard Gate\\", Polish Brama Cmentarna), between the Little Lock and the cemeteries on the south-western slope of Fort Winiary (where the military cemeteries are situated today). The gate gave access to the road to Oborniki (today's Al. Armii Poznań). In 1889–1894 it was replaced by a blockhouse on the railway which had been built there. * Mühl Thor (\\"Mill Gate\\", Brama Młyńska), by Fort Adalbert, on the road leading to a mill on the Wierzbak, roughly today's ul. Przepadek. * Bromberger Thor (\\"Bydgoszcz Gate\\", Brama Bydgoska), in the fortified embankments east of the Cathedral Lock, on the road to Bydgoszcz (Bromberg), now ul. Bydgoska in Śródka. The gate and the fortified section containing it were completed in 1839. The following other gates were built in later periods: * Wilda Thor (\\"Wilda Gate\\", Polish Brama Wildecka), built from 1841 between Bastions II and III, on the road to Wilda (today's ul. Półwiejska, near the junction with ul. Krakowska). * Berliner Thor (\\"Berlin Gate\\", Brama Berlińska), built 1843–1850 between Bastions IV and V, widened in 1867–1869, adapted for tram traffic in 1880. This was the city's main gate, on the line of St. Martin's Street (Święty Marcin), leading to the roads to Berlin and Głogów (Glogau) and to the original rail station in Jeżyce (on the site of today's Old Zoo). * Warschauer Thor (\\"Warsaw Gate\\", Brama Warszawska), built 1845, on the road to the Komadoria district and to Warsaw, in the region of today's Rondo Śródka roundabout. * Warthe Thor (\\"Warta Gate\\"), on the right bank close to Fort Rauch, giving access from outside the fortifications to the Berdychowo neighbourhood and the ferry to Grobla. * Kuhndorfer Thor (Brama Kundorfska), later Königs Thor (\\"King's Gate\\", Brama Królewska), built c. 1849–1852, on today's ul. Libelta, then the road leading to the settlement of Ku(h)ndorf and westward to Jeżyce. * Graben Pforte, built 1853–1856, a small gate giving access from Grobla (Graben) to the ferry to Berdychowo. * Eichwald Thor (Brama Dębińska), not part of the original plans, but built after 1855, leading to Dębina (Eichwald), near the southern end of today's ul. Garbary. *Kalischer Thor (\\"Kalisz Gate\\", Brama Kaliska), on the right bank, at the northern side of Fort Rauch, on the road to Kalisz. It was retained as a monument when most of the fortifications were demolished after World War I. It stood on today's ul. Berdychowo. * A gate built c. 1865 near Bastion IV, for a rail siding leading inside the ring, near today's ul. Taylora. * Ritter Thor (\\"Knight's Gate\\", Brama Rycerska), built 1881–1882 in Cavalier Strotha (at the southern end of today's ul. Ratajczaka), leading to the sidings of the new rail station.  Construction of the outer forts  Boundary stone of Fort IVa The Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855) and that of Dybbøl during the Danish War of 1864 showed the concept of a tight ring of fortifications to be outdated, as it could be broken relatively easily by modern artillery. The ring was also weakened by the need for railway lines to pass through it.Biesiadka, Gawlak, Kucharski, Wojciechowski, p. 124 This led the Engineering Committee of the Chief Inspectorate of Forts to consider, in the 1860s, the possibility of modernization. It was decided to build an outer ring of artillery forts, spaced at 2–6 km, and 6 km from the existing inner ring.Biesiadka, Gawlak, Kucharski, Wojciechowski, p. 129 Following work by the Landes-Verteidigungs-Kommission and a report from Field Marshal von Moltke concerning the Franco-Prussian War, King Wilhelm issued a decree on 5 November 1871 ordering the commission to prepare plans for necessary changes to fortifications in the united Germany. A further decree of 24 June 1872 reduced the number of fortress cities to 49. Festung Posen was among 17 strongholds which were to be modernized so as to be able to withstand a siege. Preparations for new building had begun in 1869, resulting in two preliminary plans. One provided for 11 main forts and 8 intermediate forts (Zwischenwerk) at a radius of 6–7 km, the other for 6 main and 3 intermediate forts at a radius of 3 km. Decrees of 24 June 1872 and 29 May 1873 laid down plans for fortifications in the Empire and permitted the confiscation of land for that purpose. A preliminary plan was completed on 1 June 1873, containing 8 main forts and 3 intermediate forts. This was presented to the Commission by a decree of 31 March 1874; the Commission completed its work on the plan on 7 April 1874, and it was approved by the War Ministry in a decree of 17 November 1874. The final plans were approved 24 February 1876, providing for 9 main forts (designed by Hans Alexis von Biehler) and 3 intermediate ones. An act of the Reichstag of 30 May 1873 allocated over 7 million talars for the project (the fifth largest amount granted for fort modernization). French prisoners- of-war were also used as free labour. The main forts were built in a ring of diameter 9.5 km at regular intervals of 3–4 km, forming a defensive line about long, located 2.0–4.5 km from the inner ring. Gaps in the ring at the Bogdanka and Warta valleys were filled with intermediate forts (Forts IVa and IXa in the Warta valley, and VIa between the Bogdanka and Wierzbak). The easternmost Fort III, quite distant from the others, was reinforced by three permanent artillery batteries. All the forts were to be connected by a road network, based on a circular road a few hundred metres behind the forts, and radial roads leading to the inner ring. Large shooting ranges were built at Komandoria and Główna in the north-east of the city, and two training grounds at Górczyn and Karolin.Biesiadka, Gawlak, Kucharski, Wojciechowski, p. 130 Work began in 1876, with the marking of the boundaries of the fort sites (with stones marked F.G. for Festungs-Grenze). Work then began with the forts on the Berlin road, to make up for the weakening of the inner ring caused by the new railway station. Next the southern and eastern forts were built. The northern Forts V and VI, were built last, and were modified by the addition of a second embankment. Each fort took about four years to build, the last (Fort V) being completed in 1886. The circular road was completed in the same period. New missiles using nitrocellulose, introduced in 1883, were shown in tests at Kummersdorf to be effective against standard fortifications. A still stronger explosive material – melinite – was introduced in 1886 by France and 1888 by Germany. As a consequence, the commission worked from 1885 to 1887 on strengthening the Prussian fort system. The conclusion was that the artillery had to be more distributed rather than being concentrated in forts, and the forts themselves were to be defended from attack from all sides, serving as strong points of infantry resistance, largely using machine guns. The role of linear fortifications was reduced to a minimum. A decree of 10 December 1888 ordered a review of the fortification system, leading to a decree of 9 May 1889, in which Festung Posen was one of the 17 fort systems \\"of the highest importance\\" designated for modernization. A decree of 13 May 1887 had already provided for expansion of the fortified areas around Poznań, Metz and Strasbourg, and work in Poznań began the same year. Over a few years the intermediate forts Ia, IIa, IIIa, Va, VIIa and VIIIa were built, completed in 1896 according to official records. Thus a regular ring was formed, with alternating main and intermediate forts, spaced at around 2 km. Between Forts VIa and VII was a permanent battery (Bogdanka), of a similar size to the intermediate forts. The ring was reinforced by 43 shelters for infantry, ammunition and artillery, mostly in the north between Forts IV and VIII. South of Fort III a weir was built on the Cybina. A peacetime powder store was built on the Warsaw road near Fort IIIa, as well as two new shooting ranges near Forts IIIa and VII. At the same time all main forts and the three oldest intermediate forts underwent modernization. The work required an increase in the size of the Poznań garrison, which led to the building of a barracks complex in the area of today's Bukowska and Grunwaldzka streets. A further change in concept was laid down in a decree of 23 January 1900. Festung Posen was again placed in the highest category, this time of \\"large fortresses\\". It needed to be strengthened following the removal of the inner ring on the left bank. New shelters were built in the southern and eastern sections, ten for infantry, three for artillery and three for ammunition. Other modernization work also took place, completed around 1907. With rising political tensions, a decree of 15 May 1913 ordered the construction of new forts to create a wider ring, but this never occurred. However over a hundred shelters of various types were built around existing forts. The perimeter forts and their present-day state Fort I in Starołęka Rataje) Nowe Miasto Fort VI in Jeżyce Fort VII in Ogrody The main forts in the outer ring are as follows: *Fort I (Röder). Built 1878–1880, lies on ul. Książęca in Starołęka. In 1944 converted to a Focke-Wulf aircraft factory, with rail access from Poznan- Starołęka station. Still partly used industrially. *Fort II (Stülpnagel). Built 1878–1882, lies on ul. Obodrzycka in Żegrze (Rataje). In 1944 converted to a Focke-Wulf factory, with rail connections and a siding. *Fort III (Gröber). Built 1877–1881. Lies within the New Zoo. Barracks were to be converted into a dolphinarium; the roof was removed, but the project not completed. *Fort IV (Hake). Built 1878–1882. Lies in Karolin, on ul. Bałtycka. Was on the site of an ammunitions factory during World War II, after which it was demolished. Some fragments remain. *Fort V (Waldersee I). Built 1879–1883. Lies on ul. Lechicka, by Osiedle Wichrowe Wzgórze in Winogrady. Moats were roofed in World War II and used as ammunition stores (later filled in). Front caponier and other fragments survive. *Fort VI (Tietzen). Built 1879–1883. Lies at the junction of ul. Lutycka and ul. Strzeszyńska in Jeżyce. Used by the military after 1945, survives in good condition. *Fort VII (Colomb). Built 1876–1880 (modernized 1887–1888). Lies on Al. Polska in the Ogrody district. During World War II it was the first Nazi concentration camp set up on Polish territory. Up to 20,000 Poles, mostly from the Wielkopolska region, died there through execution, torture and harsh conditions. It is now a martyrs' museum. *Fort VIII (Grolman). Built 1876–1882. Lies on ul. Grunwaldzka and ul. Bułgarska, next to the Lech Poznań football stadium. *Fort IX (Brünneck). Built 1876–1880. Lies in Świerczewo (Wilda), on ul. Głazowa. Was fully roofed to provide a large storage area. Survives in good condition, partly used industrially (also contains a disused police car-park). The hills in the park around it are used by cyclists and other recreational vehicle drivers. Fort Ia (barracks) Fort IIa Fort IIIa (now a crematorium) Fort IVa Fort Va Fort VIa Fort IXa The following are the intermediate forts: *Fort Ia (Boyen). Built 1887–1890 in Minikowo. Moats partly contain water, due to damage to drainage pipes. *Fort IIa (Thümen). Built 1887–1890 in Chartowo (Rataje). Restored and used by a nature protection group and scout groups. Moat partially filled. *Fort IIIa (Prittwitz). Built 1887–1890 in Miłostowo. Steel shutters survive (of a kind not used in other forts). Adapted for use as a crematorium. *Fort IVa (Waldersee II). Built 1878–1881 at Wilczy Młyn, now on ul. Lechicka. Damaged in World War II, later partially demolished. Maintained by scouting groups. *Fort Va (Bonin). Built 1887–1890 in Piątkowo, now lies south of Osiedle Bolesława Chrobrego. Damaged when stormed by Russian troops in February 1945. Main water tank survived until recently, though has been taken illegally for scrap. *Fort VIa (Stockhausen). Built 1879–1882 in Golęcin. Damaged in the war, then demolished. Fragments survive. *Fort VIIa (Strotha). Built 1887–1890 in Marcelin. In industrial use. *Fort VIIIa (Rohr). Built 1887–1890 in Górczyn (now near Osiedle Kopernika). Well maintained; has been used as a warehouse. *Fort IXa (Witzleben). Built 1877–1880 in Dębiec. Partly demolished in 1941 during building of a railway. Most of the outer fence survives.  Partial demolition of the inner ring  The inner ring of fortifications was now redundant militarily, and hampered the city's development. Mayor Richard Witting, coming to office in 1891, tried to have it liquidated. The army demanded 18 million marks from the city in compensation for the land, finally reduced to 12 million (the city's total budget in 1898 was 3.77 million marks). The amount was eventually paid to the army by the central government, which became the owner of the land. Demolition was confirmed by a decree of Emperor Wilhelm II dated 3 September 1902. The names which had been given to elements of the inner fortifications were transferred to forts in the new outer ring, although some of the forts received new names. Even before the official decision some demolition work had begun, including the replacement of Cemetery Gate by a blockhouse by the new railway in 1889–1894. Under the next mayor, Ernst Wilms, in 1903 a Royal Commission was set up to oversee the development of the city, under Joseph Stübben. Efforts were made to put in order the land formerly occupied by the fortifications. Demolition of the left-bank inner fortifications ended in 1912. There remained only the redoubt of Bastion III Grolman and a blockhouse at Bastion IV Colomb. Fort Winiary, and the fortifications of Ostrów Tumski and the right bank, also remained.  After World War I  In the Wielkopolska Uprising (1918–1919) the German forces largely stayed in their barracks or took refuge in the forts. The forts were generally taken over by Polish forces by negotiation, sometimes preceded by exchange of fire or brief combat. The new Polish authorities continued the demolition of the inner fortifications. In 1919 demolition began of the Great Lock and Cathedral Lock, and in 1920 that of the Fort Rauch embankments and the fortifications leading to the Bydgoszcz Gate, and preparations were made for the demolition of Forts Prittwitz and Rauch. A central order of 20 June 1920 forbade the continuation of such work without consultation. Names of elements of the fortifications were changed or replaced with existing Polish equivalents, while the outer forts returned to their numbering as pre-1902. On 27 January 1921 unemployed demobilized soldiers were assigned to continue demolition of Reduta św. Rocha and Reduta Reformatów, aiming to leave only the stone foundations of the slopes, prepared for possible re-use. In July 1921 demolition began of the Cathedral Fort and the embankments of Reduta Rusa. Finally on 30 January 1923 the military authorities agreed to the general demolition of the inner fortifications, which mostly took place between 1924 and 1927. Fort Winiary survived, as did the gunneries at Reduta Marcinkowskiego (formerly Sw. Rocha), Reduta Radziwiłła and Reduta Reformatów, as well as Reduta Czecha, and Kalisz Gate (left as a monument). The outer forts were generally left unchanged (apart from the undoing of certain work carried out during the war) and continued to form the basis for the city's defence plans. However they were not kept battle-ready, and some were left unattended, where they were used by locals for storage or even housing (which was tolerated by the military). In the late 1920s and early 1930s the city negotiated with the military to have building restrictions around the outer forts lifted, which was done, although a proposal to transfer the forts to the city for civil defence, and move the military line of defence further out (as the Germans had previously planned), was rejected. In 1931 a committee renamed the outer forts in honour of Polish patrons, mostly military (I Krzysztof Żegocki, Ia General Krzysztof Arciszewski, II Aleksander Kraszewski, IIa Kazimierz Więckowski, III General Józef Niemojewski, IIIa General Józef Sułkowski, IV Henryk Dembiński, IVa Augustyn Brzeżański, V the Mycielskis, Va General Ludwik Mierosławski, VI Kazimierz Mielęcki, VIa General Ludwik Bogusławski, VII Florian Dąbrowski, VIIa General Zygmunt Zieliński, VIII General Kazimierz Grudzielski, VIIIa General Michał Sokolnicki, IX Edmund Taczanowski, IXa General Wincenty Axamitowski). These names did not come into wide use. During the World War II Nazi occupation, Fort VII gained notoriety as a Nazi concentration camp, where up to 20,000 Poles died. Between 1940 and 1945, Fort Grolman and Fort Rauch formed the nucleus of the Stalag XXI-D PoW camp. In the later part of the war Poznań was declared one of the stronghold cities (Festungen) which the Nazis intended to defend at all costs, and so the name Festung Posen was revived. The outer forts were used to defend the city during the Battle of Poznań (1945), and Fort Winiary was the defenders' last point of resistance, the reduit incurring significant damage. After the war the site of Fort Winiary was converted into the Cytadela park.

The station had won a licence – as part of a strategy by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to create a network of regional youth stations across the Republic – to operate a 'youth' oriented station that would broadcast across seven counties in the northwest and west of Ireland, targeting listeners aged between 15 and 34. In 2011, i102-104FM merged with its sister station i105-107FM; the combined station now broadcasts as iRadio. i102-104FM had its studios originally in Galway City, and towards the end of the station's life, Athlone. It was licensed to cover Counties Donegal, Galway, Leitrim, Longford, Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo. It was also popular in the neighbouring regions of counties Clare, Limerick, Tipperary, Offaly, Westmeath, Cavan, Monaghan and the border areas of the North. In County Donegal, because local radio station Highland Radio was already broadcasting on 103.3 MHz, i102-104 used the frequency of 96.9 MHz. High-profile figures such as the comedian Tommy Tiernan and the presenter Hector Ó hEochagáin were signed up in an effort to raise the profile of the station. There had been five competitors for the lucrative northwest licence, with bids coming from Dublin's SPIN 1038, Cork's Red FM, and the northwest station Ocean FM, through 'Vibe FM', and the €20m licence was granted to i105-107FM in November 2006. i102-104FM was owned by the iRadio consortium that has applied for several other of the regional youth licences on offer from the BAI, winning the northeast and midlands licence through i105-107FM. In August 2009 i102-104 was rated the fastest growing 15-to-34 radio station in the country, reaching over 166,000 people each week. It was also the regional radio station most listened to by 18- to 34-year-olds in Ireland.

Up to the end of World War II, he worked in Nikolaj Vladimirovich Timofeev-Resovskij's Abteilung für Experimentelle Genetik, at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Hirnforschung. He was taken prisoner by the Russians at the close of World War II. After rescue from the Krasnoyarsk PoW camp, he initially worked in Nikolaus Riehl's group at Plant No. 12 in Elektrostal’, Russia, but at the end of 1947 was sent to work in Sungul' at a sharashka known under the cover name Ob’ekt 0211. At the Sungul' facility, he again worked in a biological research department under the direction of Timofeev-Resovskij. Upon arrival in East Germany in the mid-1950s, Born became the director of the Institut für Angewandte Isotopenforschung in Buch, Berlin. He also completed his Habilitation at the Technische Hochschule Dresden, where he then also became a professor on the Fakultät für Kerntechnik. In 1957, he received and accepted a call to become a professor of radiochemistry at the Technische Hochschule München in West Germany. Education Born was born in Berlin. He trained and educated as a radiochemist under Otto Hahn at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Chemie. Upon receipt of his doctorate, he was then an Assistent (Assistant) to Hahn, in the 1930s.Riehl and Seitz, 1996, 121.ZfK - 50 Jahre Forschung in Rossendorf, Zentralinstitut für Kernphysik Career=In Germany= Born worked at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Hirnforschung (KWIH, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Brain Research)Today, the KWIH is known as the Max-Planck Institut für Hirnforschung, MPIH . After World War II, all of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institutes were named after the physicist Max Planck. of the Kaiser- Wilhelm Gesellschaft, in Berlin-Buch. At the KWIH, he was in Nikolaj Vladimirovich Timofeev-Resovskij's Abteilung für Experimentelle Genetik (Department for Experimental Genetics),H. J. Born, N. W. Timoféeff-Ressovsky and K. G. Zimmer Biologische Anwendungen des Zählrohres, Naturwissenschaften Volume 30, Number 40, 600-603 (1942). The authors were identified as being in the Genetics Department of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin-Buch. a world-renowned department with the status of an institute. At the KWIH, Born examined the distribution of Radionuclides in the organs of rodents, and he also worked with fission products from research programs conducted under Nikolaus Riehl, scientific director of the Auergesellschaft, who was a participant in the German nuclear energy project Uranverein. What happened to Born after the Russians entered Berlin, at the close of World War II, is best understood in the context of his colleague Karl Zimmer at the KWIH, who also had a professional relationship with Nikolaus Riehl at the Auergesellschaft. At the close of World War II, Russia had special search teams operating in Austria and Germany, especially in Berlin, to identify and \\"requisition\\" equipment, materiel, intellectual property, and personnel useful to the Soviet atomic bomb project. The exploitation teams were under the Russian Alsos, and they were headed by Lavrenij Beria's deputy, Colonel General A. P. Zavenyagin. These teams were composed of scientific staff members, in NKVD officer's uniforms, from the bomb project's only laboratory, Laboratory No. 2, in Moscow. In mid-May 1945, the Russian nuclear physicists Georgy Flerov and Lev Artsimovich, in NKVD colonel's uniforms, compelled Zimmer to take them to the location of Riehl and his staff, who had evacuated their Auergesellschaft facilities and were west of Berlin, hoping to be in an area occupied by the American or British military forces. Riehl was detained at the search team's facility in Berlin-Friedrichshagen for a week. This sojourn in Berlin turned into 10 years in the Soviet Union! Riehl and his staff, including their families, were flown to Moscow on 9 July 1945. Riehl was to head up a group at Plant No. 12 in Ehlektrostal’ (Электросталь\\"Электросталь\\" is sometimes transliterated as \\"Elektrostal\\". A one-to-one transliteration scheme transliterates the Cyrillic letter \\"Э\\" as \\"Eh\\", which distinguishes it from that for the Cyrillic letter \\"Е\\" given as \\"E\\". Transliterations often also drop the soft sign \\"ь\\".).Riehl and Seitz, 1996, 71-72.Oleynikov, 2000, 7. =In Russia= From 1945 to 1950, Riehl was in charge of a group at Plant No. 12 in Ehlektrostal', which had been assigned the task of industrializing reactor-grade uranium production. When Riehl learned that H. J. Born and Karl Zimmer were being held in Krasnogorsk, in the main PoW camp for Germans with scientific degrees, Riehl arranged though Zavenyagin to have them sent to Ehlektrostal’. Alexander Catsch, who had been taken prisoner with Zimmer, was also sent to the Ehlektrostal’ Plant No. 12. Riehl had a hard time incorporating Born, Catsch, and Zimmer into his tasking on uranium production, as Born was a radiochemist, Catsch was a physician and radiation biologist, and Zimmer was a physicist and radiation biologist. Born's family arrived in Ehlektrostal’ on 20 August 1946.Riehl and Seitz, 1996, 2, 31, 71, 83, 89-104, 121-128, and 202.Maddrell, 2006, 179-180, 186, 189, and 210-221.Oleynikov, 2000, 11, 15-16, and Reference #151 on p. 29.Karl G. Zimmer Papers – University of Tennessee. After the detonation of the Russian uranium bomb, uranium production was going smoothly and Riehl's oversight was no longer necessary at Plant No. 12. Riehl then went, in 1950, to head an institute in Sungul', where he stayed until 1952. Essentially the remaining personnel in his group were assigned elsewhere, with the exception of H. E. Ortmann, A. Baroni (PoW), and Herbert Schmitz (PoW), who went with Riehl. However, Riehl had already sent Born, Catsch, and Zimmer to the institute in December 1947. The institute in Sungul’ was responsible for the handling, treatment, and use of radioactive products generated in reactors, as well as radiation biology, dosimetry, and radiochemistry. The institute was known as Laboratory B, and it was overseen by the 9th Chief Directorate of the NKVD (MVD after 1946), the same organization which oversaw the Russian Alsos operation. The scientific staff of Laboratory B – a ShARAShKA – was both Soviet and German, the former being mostly political prisoners or exiles, although some of the service staff were criminals.Riehl and Seitz, 1996, 121-128, and 202.Oleynikov, 2000, 15-17.

[In Russian] (VNIITF ). Penzina is cited as head of the VNIITF Archive in Snezhinsk.) One of the political prisoners in Laboratory B was Riehls’ colleague from the KWIH, N. V. Timofeev-Resovskij, who, as a Soviet citizen, was arrested by the Soviet forces in Berlin at the conclusion of the war, and he was sentenced to 10 years in the Gulag. In 1947, Timofeev- Resovskij was rescued out of a harsh Gulag prison camp, nursed back to health, and sent to Sungul' to complete his sentence, but still make a contribution to the Soviet atomic bomb project. At Laboratory B, Timofeev-Resovskij headed a biophysics research department, in which Born, Catsch, and Zimmer were able to conduct work similar to that which they had done in Germany, and all three became section heads in Timofeev-Resovskij's department. Specifically, Born examined fission products, developed methods of separating plutonium from fission products created in a nuclear reactor, and investigated and developed radiation health and safety measures. In preparation for release from the Soviet Union, it was standard practice to put personnel into quarantine for a few years if they worked on projects related to the Soviet atomic bomb project, as was the case for Born. Additionally, in 1954, the Deutsche Demokratische Republik (DDR, German Democratic Republic) and the Soviet Union prepared a list of scientists they wished to keep in the DDR, due to their having worked on projects related to the Soviet atomic bomb project; this list was known as the \\"A-list\\". On this A-list were the names of 18 scientists. Nine, possibly 10, of the names were associated with the Riehl group which worked at Plant No. 12 in Ehlektrostal’. Born, Catsch, Riehl, and Zimmer were on the list.The A-list prepared by East Germany and the Soviet Union in 1954 had 18 names on it. These Germans were to be encouraged to stay in East Germany, as they had done work on the Soviet atomic bomb project. At least nine members worked in Riehl’s group at Ehlektrostal’: *Hans-Joachim Born, Alexander Catsch, Werner Kirst, Przybilla, Nikolaus Riehl, Herbert Thieme, Tobein, Günter Wirths, and Karl Zimmer. *Schmidt may be a tenth Riehl group member Herbert Schmitz, or the name may refer to Fritz Schmidt, another nuclear scientist who was returned to Germany. Others on the list were: *Heinz Barwich, Justus Mühlenpfordt, and Karl-Franz Zühlke, who all worked at Institute G headed by Gustav Hertz, *Ingrid Schilling and Alfred Schimohr, who both worked at Institute A headed by Manfred von Ardenne, *Willi Lange, Gerhard Siewert, and Ludwig Ziehl.

Riehl arrived in the DDR on 4 April 1955, and by early June he was in the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). Other colleagues of Riehl who worked with him in Russia also went West; Alexander Catsch went to the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), Günter Wirths fled to the FRG and Karl Zimmer went legally. Upon arrival in the DDR, Born became the director of the Institut für Angewandte Isotopenforschung (Institute for Applied Isotope Research) in Berlin-Buch. He also completed his Habilitation H. J.

In 1957, he received and accepted a call to become a professor of radiochemistry at the Technische Hochschule München, which in 1970 was reorganized and renamed the Technische Universität München.

The adult male and female are similar in appearance, with predominantly golden-yellow plumage and orange-flushed underparts and face. Sun parakeets are very social birds, typically living in flocks. They form monogamous pairs for reproduction, and nest in palm cavities in the tropics. Sun parakeets mainly feed on fruits, flowers, berries, blossoms, seeds, nuts, and insects. Conures are commonly bred and kept in aviculture and may live up to 30 years. This species is currently threatened by loss of habitat and trapping for plumage or the pet trade. Sun parakeets are now listed as endangered by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature).  Taxonomy  The sun parakeet was one of the many species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. As Linnaeus did with many of the parrots he described, he placed this species in the genus Psittacus, but it has since been moved to the widely accepted Aratinga, which contains a number of similar New World species, while Psittacus is now restricted to the type species, the grey parrot. The specific epithet solstitialis is derived from the Latin for 'of the summer solstice', hence 'sunny', and refers to its golden plumage. The two widely used common names are \\"sun conure\\", used in aviculture and by some authorities such as Thomas Arndt, and \\"sun parakeet\\" as used by the American Ornithologists' Union and widely in official birdlists, field guides, and by birders.Arndt, T. (1997). Lexicon of Parrots. Arndt Verlag. The sun parakeet is monotypic, but the Aratinga solstitialis complex includes three additional species from Brazil: jandaya parakeet, golden-capped parakeet, and sulphur-breasted parakeet. These have all been considered subspecies of the sun parakeet, but most recent authorities maintain their status as separate species. Alternatively, the sun parakeet and the sulphur-breasted parakeet have been suggested to represent one species, while the jenday parakeet and golden- capped parakeet represent a second. Of these, the sulphur-breasted parakeet only received widespread recognition in 2005, having gone unnoticed at least partially due to its resemblance to certain preadult plumages of the sun parakeet. The sun, jandaya, and golden-capped parakeets will all interbreed in captivity (the sulphur-breasted also likely will interbreed with these). In the wild, hybrids between the jandaya parakeet and golden-capped parakeet have been reported in their limited area of contact, but most such individuals could be subadults (which easily could be confused with hybrids). As far as known, the remaining taxa are entirely allopatric, although the sun parakeet and the sulphur-breasted parakeet possibly come into contact in the southern Guianas, where some doubts exists over their exact identity.Silverira, L., de Lima, F., & Höfling, E. (2005). A new species of Aratinga Conure (Psittaformes: Psittacidae) from Brazil, with taxonomical remarks on the Aratinga solstitialis complex. The Auk 122(1): 292–305.  Description  Adult on the left and three juveniles on the right On average, sun parakeets weigh around 110 g (4 oz) and are around 30 cm (12 in) long.Sun Conure Parrot. PBase.com The sexes are similar in plumage. Adults have a rich yellow crown, nape, mantle, lesser wing-coverts, tips of the greater wing-coverts, chest, and underwing-coverts. The face and belly are orange with red around the ears. The base of the greater wing-coverts, tertials, and base of the primaries are green, while the secondaries, tips of the primaries, and most of the primary coverts are dark blue. The tail is olive-green with a blue tip. From below, all the flight feathers are dark greyish. The bill is black. The legs and the bare eye-ring are grey, but the latter often fades to white in captivity (so using amount of grey or white in the eye-ring for determining \\"purity\\" of an individual can be misleading). It is easily confused with the closely related jandaya parakeet and sulphur-breasted parakeet, but the former has entirely green wing-coverts, mantle, and vent, while the latter has green mottling to the mantle and less orange to the underparts. The sun parakeet is also superficially similar to the pale-billed. Super Sun Conure is often also named by breeders as (Yellow-Factor Sun Conure) since there is also (Red-Factor Sun Conure). Super Sun Conure Juvenile sun parakeets display a predominantly green plumage and resemble similar-aged sulphur-breasted parakeets. The distinctive yellow, orange, and reddish colouration on the back, abdomen, and head is attained with maturity.  Distribution and habitat  Sun conures live in a relatively small region of northeastern South America: the north Brazilian state of Roraima, southern Guyana, extreme southern Suriname, and southern French Guiana. They also occur as vagrants to coastal French Guiana. Their status in Venezuela is unclear, but recent sightings from the southeast near Santa Elena de Uairén have been reported. They may occur in Amapá or far northern Pará (regions where the avifauna generally is very poorly documented), but this remains to be confirmed. Populations found along the Amazon River in Brazil are now known to belong to the sulphur-breasted parakeet. Sun conures are mostly found in tropical habitats, but their exact ecological requirements remain relatively poorly known. They are widely reported as occurring within dry savanna woodlands and coastal forests, but recent sightings suggest they mainly occur at altitudes less than 1200 m, at the edge of humid forests growing in foothills in the Guiana Shield, and cross more open savannah habitats only when traveling between patches of forest. Sun conures have been seen in shrublands along the Amazon riverbank, as well as forested valleys and coastal, seasonally flooded forests. These conures usually inhabit fruiting trees and palm groves.  Behavior  A group of sun parakeets Like other members of the genus Aratinga, the sun parakeet is very social and typically occurs in large flocks of 20 to 30 individuals. They rarely leave the flock, but when they get separated from the group, they squawk and scream in a high-pitched voice which can carry for hundreds of yards, allowing individuals to communicate with their flock and return to them. Flocks are relatively quiet while feeding, but are known to be very vocal and make loud noises when in flight. They can travel many miles in a single day, and they are fast, direct flyers. Nonverbal communication is also practised, with a variety of physical displays. Birds within a flock rest, feed one another, preen, and bathe throughout the daylight hours. They move through the trees using their beaks for extra support. They also have the ability to use their feet like hands to help hold, examine, or eat items. Sun conures have been reported to nest in palm cavities. When in molt, conures are uncomfortable, so are easily irritable. Bathing, warm rainfalls, and humidity allow the sheaths of each pin feather to open more easily and lessen their discomfort. Sun conures are extremely smart and curious, so require constant mental stimulation and social interaction. Their speech and ability to learn tricks in captivity are quite moderate. Otherwise, relatively little is known about their behavior in the wild, in part due to confusion with the sulphur- breasted parakeet species. Regardless, the behavior of the two is unlikely to differ to any great extent.  Diet  At 286x286px In the wild, sun conures mainly feed on fruits, flowers, berries, blossoms, seeds, nuts, and insects. They feed on both ripe and half-ripe seeds of both fruits and berries. They also consume red cactus fruit, Malpighia berries, and legume pods. At times, they forage from agricultural crops and may be considered pests. They require more protein intake during breeding season, more carbohydrates when rearing young, and more calcium during egg production. In captivity, their diets may include grass seeds, beans, nuts, fruits (apples, papaya, bananas, oranges, grapefruits, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, gooseberries, currants, rowans, elderberries, hawthorn berries, rose hips, cucumbers and tomatoes), vegetables (spinach, Chinese cabbage, cress, roquette, kale, broccoli, carrots, alfalfa, peas, endive, and sweet potatoes), dandelions, chickweed, soaked corn, germinated sunflower seeds and spray millet. They may also eat fruit tree buds (elderberry bushes, willows, hawthorn, and aspen), ant eggs, mealworms or their substitutes (hard-boiled eggs, bread, biscuits, hard cheese or low-fat cottage cheese). Cuttle bones, mineral blocks, and gravel or ground oyster shells may be given to aid in mechanical digestion.  Reproduction  A pair of sun conures Young sun conures form monagamous pairs around 4 to 5 months of age. Prior to breeding, they may be seen feeding and grooming one another. Mating can last up to three minutes, after which pairs become very affectionate with each other. Prior to egg laying, the female's abdomen noticeably swells. They have been known to nest in trees or in cavities of Maurita flexuosa palms. Fertility rate of sun conures is relatively high. Typical clutch size is three or four white eggs, and they may be laid in two- to three-day intervals. Pairs may only destroy and eat their eggs in cases of calcium deficiency. Females are responsible for the entire incubation period from 23 to 27 days, and only leave the nest for short feeding periods. Males aggressively protect the nest from potential predators. Eggs may fail to hatch if they are not kept warm or if the bird fails to break through the shell successfully, which may take from a few hours to a few days. Chicks are born blind, naked and completely vulnerable. Only after 10 days, they begin to open their eyes and their feather quills break through. Both parents participate in feeding the chicks. The young depend on their parents for 7 to 8 weeks after hatching, and only become independent after 9 to 12 weeks. Conures are sexually mature around 2 years of age and have a lifespan ranging from 25 to 30 years.  Status  Sun conures are currently endangered. Unfortunately, their population numbers are declining rapidly due to loss of habitat, hunting for plumage, and being excessively wild caught – about 800,000 each year, for the pet trade. Now, more sun conures are living in people's homes than in the wild. Since the Wild Bird Conservation Act was put in place in 1992 to ban the importation of parrots (including sun conures) into the United States, they are more frequently bred in captivity for domestication purposes. Similarly, the European Union more recently banned the importation of wild-caught birds in 2007. These legislations may help increase their population in the wild. In the past, the sun parakeet has been considered safe and listed as least concern, but recent surveys in southern Guyana (where previously considered common) and the Brazilian state Roraima have revealed that it possibly is extirpated from the former and rare in the latter. It is very rare in French Guiana, but may breed in the southern part of the country (this remains unconfirmed). Today, it is regularly bred in captivity, but the capture of wild individuals potentially remains a serious threat. This has fueled recent discussions regarding its status, leading to it being uplisted to endangered in the 2008 IUCN Red List.  Aviculture  A young female sun conure hatched in captivity The sun conure is noted for its very loud squawks and screams compared to its relatively small size. It is capable of mimicking humans, but not as well as some larger parrots. They are popular as pets because of their bright coloration and curious nature. Due to their inquisitive temperaments, they demand a great deal of attention from their owners, with whom they can be loving and cuddly. Hand-reared pets can be very friendly towards people with whom they are familiar, but they may be aggressive with strangers and even territorial with visitors.Sun Conure. theparrotplace.co.nz Sun conures are capable of learning many tricks and can even perform in front of a live audience. They enjoy listening to music, to which they occasionally sing and dance. Like many parrots, they are determined chewers and require toys and treats to chew on. Other activities enjoyed by sun conures include taking baths and preening feathers. Many owners clip their conures' wings, but this is not necessary if the proper precautions are put in place. Due to environmental hazards, conures should not be allowed to fly unsupervised. Sun conures are great candidates for outdoor flight when well trained, as they are loyal, but risk potential must be minimized. In captivity, their lifespans range from 15 to 30 years.

Biography Edmund H. Garrett's bookplate, which he designed. A woman resembling a Muse is surrounded by printing tools. The motto reads \\"Honoratus Qui Virtutem Honorat\\" Garrett was born in Albany, New York on October 19, 1853. While little is known of his initial art education, Garrett rose through the ranks to become a distinguished member of the Boston Art Club and the Copley Society of Art, and was an acquaintance and colleague of renowned impressionist artist Childe Hassam. He studied at the Académie Julian in Paris under Gustave Boulanger, Jules Lefebvre, John Paul Laurens, and Hector Leroux. After residing in Paris for approximately five years, he returned to America to establish a successful studio in Boston. His first original wood engraving was created in 1879 under the tutelage of Robert Swain Gifford. His first original prints specialized in both architectural views and landscapes, with his later etchings mostly featuring areas around Boston. Garrett provided the chief influence for Childe Hassam's first study trip to Europe in July 1883. On June 30, 1883, Garrett and Hassam sailed to Europe aboard the SS Anchoria, then travelled for several months throughout Great Britain, The Netherlands, France, Italy, Switzerland and Spain studying paintings from the old masters and creating watercolors of the European countryside. In late August 1883, both Garrett and Hassam sailed aboard the SS Alsatia to several Spanish ports before crossing the Atlantic back home. After they both returned to Boston, Garrett resumed his illustration work for various publishers, which was very much in demand, keeping him from spending energy on his watercolors. During this time, Garrett worked at a studio located at 12 West Street in Boston, which he shared with Hassam and fellow-artist Charles Henry Turner. In 1884, Garrett exhibited two watercolors at the Pennsylvania Academy (\\"A Street in Granada\\" and \\"El Mirador de la Reina, Alhambra\\") in 1884. He also exhibited \\"A Street in Granada\\" at the \\"Third Annual Exhibition of the Paint and Clay Club,\\" which was held at the Gallery of the Boston Art Club in March 1884. During the last two decades of the nineteenth century, Edmund Garrett's paintings and etchings were widely exhibited throughout the United States and in France at the Paris Salon. During his lifetime, Garrett was a prolific illustrator of many books and publications, including various books of poetry by Tennyson, Keats, and Schiller; the Legends of King Arthur; Austen's Pride & Prejudice; Marie Louise de la Ramée's (Ouida's) A Dog of Flanders; stories by Alexandre Dumas; various books of Elizabethan and Victorian songs; and other books by Longfellow, Sir Walter Scott, Shelley, Wordsworth, and Hawthorne, among others. Today, Garrett's works adorn the walls of the Art Institute of Chicago, Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the New York Public Library, the Boston Public Library, and the Massachusetts State House. Other works appear in collections at the Public Library in Winchester, Mass; Calumet Club (Boston, Mass.), Brookside Library; Conant Memorial Church; and the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco.

P. gibbosus is of the order Hymenoptera and the genus Philanthus. It is native to the Midwestern United States and the western Appalachians. P. gibbosus are often observed to visit flowers and other plants in search of insect prey to feed their young. The prey that P. gibbosus catches is then coated in a layer of pollen and fed to the young wasps.  Taxonomy and phylogeny  Philanthus gibbosus is a member of the family Crabronidae of wasps within the order Hymenoptera. Below is a cladogram that is based on a 2012 study conducted by Debevic et al. and published in the journal Zoologica Scriptica. The study investigated molecular phylogeny to reveal that the bees, Anthophila, came from within the family Crabronidae, meaning the family is, therefore, paraphyletic. The genus Philanthus contains about 135 other species in addition to P. gibbosus. The predation habits of the family Crabronidae shed light on the question whether bees or wasps came first. Based on this evidence, bees are a lineage of pollen-collecting wasps that descend directly from a group of predatory wasps in Crabronidae.  Description and identification  P. gibbosus is a small and robust wasp that is about 10–12 mm in length. P. gibbosus has an especially broad head and a coat of chitin that is shiny black with yellow spots on the head and yellow stripes on the abdomen and thorax. There are very large, deep punctures on the abdomen of P. gibbosus, making the species easy and distinct to identify in comparison to other members of the genus Philanthus. = Females = While the general range of P. gibbosus size is 10–12 mm in length, females are usually closer to the smaller end of the scale. Female P. gibbosus have more yellow coloration on the head than do the males of the species. Female P. gibbosus = Males = The males of P. gibbosus resemble the females very closely, but the most notable difference is the significantly reduced presence of yellow spots on the head. This is opposite of the usual pattern observed within the order Hymenoptera. Most commonly, the males in hymenopteran species have an excess of yellow spots on the head while females lack spots.  Distribution and habitat  P. gibbosus is a common and widely distributed species in North America. It has been primarily observed to inhabit the central Midwestern United States; it has been observed as far west as Kansas and as far south as Georgia, but tends to be concentrated around Missouri and Tennessee. P. gibbosus also tends to inhabit coastal areas where the soil has a sandy composition. P. gibbosus is known to prefer the climate and habitat of deciduous forests. P. gibbosus prefers the soil composition of deciduous and coastal regions because it builds its nests in burrows. Thus, the soil must be of an ideal composition for burrowing.  Colony cycle  In general, P. gibbosus goes through two generations of colonies a year. = Colony initiation = P. gibbosus larvae The cycle begins around the first or second week of June when the early pioneers start searching for a nesting site. Even though the searching starts as early as June, the actual digging of the new nest may not start until the first or second week of July. By early July, however, nest construction is in full swing. Females spend about three weeks completely devoting themselves to provisioning and laying eggs, but once the season is over, they die. = Colony growth = In the middle of July, the progeny of the first brood begin to emerge. The emergence of larvae continues to rise linearly through the last week of August. A majority of these new progeny have already dispersed to lay new eggs and died off by early September. The few members of the new progeny that remain continue laying eggs for another two weeks, but will die by October, likely due to changes in climate around that time. This second generation of larvae survive the winter by remaining in their cocoons from October through April. In April, the second generation changes into pupae and emerge in May. Those that emerge in May are the wasps that are responsible for searching for a new nesting location in June.  Behavior  Adult P. gibbosus females are responsible for digging tunnels into the ground for nesting. Meanwhile, territorial males mark objects and supporting structures surrounding the nest with pheromones to demarcate the nesting territory from competing males. The larvae generated by the females are carnivorous, which forces the inseminated females to hunt for other invertebrates, in this case bees (hence the common name \\"beewolf\\"), on which she lays her eggs. By laying her eggs on pollen-coated bee species, the larvae are supplied with prey for nutrients instantly when they emerge. The adults, on the other hand, feed on nectar that is foraged from flowers. = Burrow occupation = Various burrow architectures of P. gibbosus P. gibbosus is a solitary wasp that nests in the ground. Several individuals have been observed to cohabit a single burrow at a time. However, there is evidence that suggests that while females tend to occupy the parental nest for a mere several days of their lives, the males will sometimes inhabit the nest for their entire life. After the few days in their original nest, the females will disperse to new nests. However, one single female may continue to inhabit and expand the original nest. On very rare occasions, two females may provision the original nest at the same time for a very brief period. Evidence suggests that P. gibbosus may be representative of a unique stage in presociality in which temporary communal nesting occurs at certain phases of the nesting cycle, in spite of the species' usual solitary living. = Communication = Because P. gibbosus is a solitary wasp species, there is not much need for intra-species communication. However, when mating, males are responsible for marking the territory surrounding the nest with pheromones as a means of warding off other competing males from mating with the female in the nest. These pheromones are the main form of intra-communication, specifically between the different, individual males of P. gibbosus.  Nesting sites  P. gibbosus prefers nesting in sandy soil. Because soils with high sand composition are lighter in weight than other types of soil, they are ideal for the burrowing behavior of P. gibbosus since sandy soil is easier to dig through. Moreover, the nesting sites are usually centered around some sort of supporting structure, for example underneath bricks, tree roots, or cement. As a result, weedy, sandy areas of earth are strongly preferable as nesting sites for P. gibbosus, which can often be found near coastal areas as a result. Philanthus burrowing = Burrow structure = During the main season of its activity, May through September, the entrance to the nesting sites of P. gibbosus can be characterized by the scattered heaps of sand or soil around their supporting structure, usually bricks or tree roots. The sand heaps are very low and spread out. In building these sand heaps, females can be observed backing out of the burrow with moist sand or soil that is spread around into the heaps using jerks of her front legs. While burrowing, P. gibbosus stands on its hind legs. In order to dig the actual burrow, P. gibbosus uses its tarsi and mandibles to dig a shaft that is at least two feet in length. The shaft culminates in an oval shaped cell in which eggs are provisioned. Other oval shaped cells line the shaft which are smaller in size and contain the skeletons of other bees that were killed and fed to the larvae as nutrients.  Mimicry and camouflage = Mimicry = Female P. gibbosus full body coloration P. gibbosus is a part of a mimicry group with a wide variety of other wasps that also exhibit black and yellow banding and coloring. It has been observed that mimicry is high in spring and early summer, generally absent in midsummer, and infrequent in late summer. This implies that some members of the mimicry group, including P. gibbosus, may be selected to avoid the midsummer season when insectivorous birds are abundant and have not yet learned to avoid the models which the mimics resemble. The colony cycle of P. gibbosus lines up with this scheduling in such a way that minimizes the amount of predation the species faces. = Warning coloration = While P. gibbosus does not camouflage with its surroundings, it exhibits a black and yellow chitin coating that serves as a warning to other predatory species. This coloration pattern that is characteristic of many species of wasps is a somewhat universal sign that an organism stings and should, as a result, be avoided in predation.  Interaction with other species = Diet = P. gibbosus spend a significant amount of time loitering around flowers and other plants in search of insect prey to feed their young, most often bee species. Some common bee species that P. gibbosus predates include C. sparsus, O. pura, and E. arcuatus. Predation of a bee by P. gibbosus = Stings = P. gibbosus is notable in that it stings its prey in a membranous location on the ventral surface of the abdomen where the venom is quick to incapacitate many major, voluntary muscles. The paralyzing effect of the injected venom is likely due largely in part to a block of the somatic neuromuscular transmission. It has also been established that the venom is not limited exclusively to the natural prey, the honey bee, but also in many other insect species belonging to different orders, including spiders. Only P. triangulum itself and a digger wasp that preys on P. triangulum are immune to the venom. However, the sting does not kill the prey. The prey may attempt to sting in return, but P. gibbosus always grabs the prey in such a way that the well-armored portions of the body are presented, thus protecting P. gibbosus from a retaliation by the prey. P. gibbosus then carries its paralyzed prey back to an oval cell in its nest for temporary storage until it is later used in the laying of an egg. = Predators = Although P. gibbosus feeds on insects, they are also prey for certain insects as well. Predatory insects for P. gibbosus include praying mantis, robber flies, and dragonflies. Sometimes, smaller P. gibbosus individuals will be preyed on by larger wasps. Some birds will even regularly consume wasps. A few examples of birds that prey on P. gibbosus include sparrows, wrens, and summer tanagers. In general, these birds normally exclusively hunt solitary wasps, making P. gibbosus an ideal target. Moreover, the birds avoid disturbing P. gibbosus near their nests. = Defense = P. gibbosus has a sting that is painful and menacing enough to deter most potential predators. P. gibbosus's black and yellow coloring serves as a warning to other organisms, as that color pattern often indicates a dangerous species. Additionally, the burrowing behavior of P. gibbosus provides the species with a suitable hiding spot to avoid predators. Because the burrows are so far into the ground, usually around two feet, P. gibbosus is able to avoid predation by remaining in its burrow. = Parasites = P. gibbosus is most notably parasitized by a nest parasite, Senotainia trilineata, a Miltogrammid fly. P. gibbosus utilizes a flight pattern in which it flies over the nest from above as a means of surveying its nest for the parasite, one that is different from other species of the same genus. = Mutualism = While not much research has been done on which specific pathogens affect P. gibbosus, Streptomyces have been observed to be antibiotic-producing symbionts, which have been suggested to potentially defend their wasp hosts from a variety of pathogenic microbes. This array of phylogenetically diverse and chemically prolific Actinobacteria that has been observed in P. gibbosus suggests that these types of insect-associated Actinobacteria can serve as a source of natural products of pharmaceutical interest for other species.  Interaction with humans = Agriculture = P. gibbosus is a pollinator of some plants. It has been observed pollinating carrot plants. = Beekeeping = P. gibbosus presents a challenge for beekeepers. Because of its tendency to prey on honey-producing bees, P. gibbosus has been known to attack beekeeping sites. This complicates the process of beekeeping and hinders honey production.

The section called the chemin gravelais (\\"gravelled road\\") linked Normandy and Anjou. The route was alluded to as the chemin du Roy (the \\"King's road\\") in a document of 1454. For pilgrims to Santiago de Compostela it was one of the feeder routes leading to Poitiers, where it joined the Way of St James beyond the Pyrenees. This route, the only route that was fit for wheeled vehicles, was a long-range commercial link that gained strategic significance in wartime; where it crossed Bourgon at the meadow of Le Pavement, the Battle of La Brossinière was fought along the chemin in September 1423, a victory for French in the Hundred Years' War; the English forces were forced to abandon their baggage train, which had dictated their course with its heavily laden wagons. Parts of the route may be traced today from the north to south,\\"Le Chemin de Cocaigne ou voie du Cotentin à la Gascogne\\" traces the route in detail. starting from the département de la Mayenne. Even where the road was ploughed up centuries ago, some toponyms may still reveal its former passage. South of La Gravelle the route passed through Le Pertre, near which the hamlets of Saint-Cyr-le-Gravelais (1 km) and Ruillé- le-Gravelais (5.3 km) record the passage of the route, which still may be traced on a paved secondary route leading due south of Le Pertre to the crossroads at Saint-Poix. Two kilometers southeast of Loroux, a place that still bears the name of le Carrefour appears to indicate the intersection with a way that led from Carhaix to Lisieux. The village of La Pellerine recalls the throngs of strangers who passed as pilgrims; half a kilometer to the south is La Gascoignerie, recalling the route's southern destination.\\"Le Chemin de Cocaigne ou voie du Cotentin à la Gascogne\\" Often way-stations sited where roads intersected the main route bear names that indicated the side road's destination.

By 1677 her armament had been increased to 54 guns. Sketch of HMS Newcastle by Willem van de Velde, circa 1678 Her first action came in 1655 when, along with fourteen other warships, she sailed into Porto Farina in Algiers to engage Barbary Pirates. This action resulted in the destruction of the entire pirate fleet, which won the Newcastle lineage its first battle honour. In 1657 she took part in Admiral Blake's daring attack on Santa Cruz de Tenerife, and in 1665, she fought at the Battle of Lowestoft. On 14 March 1674, Newcastle, under the command of Sir John Wetwang, captured the Dutch East India ship Wapen van Rotterdam in the Battle of Ronas Voe. Prior to the November 1688 Glorious Revolution, George Churchill assumed command and Newcastle was assigned to the Channel. Shortly before Plymouth declared for William III on 18 November, Churchill entered the port for repairs but this appears to have been an excuse; Newcastle was the first significant naval defection and the rest of the fleet soon followed. Newcastle was wrecked at Spithead in the Great Storm of 1703 with the loss of 229 of her crew.

He won the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting in 1982 as a reporter for The Seattle Times. Henderson was born in Washington D.C., but moved to Beatrice, Nebraska as a young child. He attended Wentworth Military Academy and Junior College in Lexington, Missouri, graduating in 1959. After three years in the U.S. Army, he continued his education at Creighton University and the University of Nebraska at Omaha. Henderson began his career as a journalist at the Council Bluffs Daily Nonpareil (1962–1966), before moving on to the Omaha World-Herald (1966–1967), and The Seattle Times (1967–1985). While working in the newsroom as an investigative reporter at The Seattle Times in 1981, Henderson took a call from a man named Steve Titus. Titus explained to Henderson that he was about to be sentenced for a sexual assault he did not commit. Henderson looked into the case and wrote a series of three stories entitled \\"One Man's Battle to Clear His Name, a story of rape, wrongful conviction and vindication,\\" challenging the circumstantial evidence against Titus. When officials followed up on Henderson's leads, they found a man who resembled Titus and who eventually confessed to the crime. The report convinced a judge to reverse Titus' conviction. Henderson won the 1982 Pulitzer Prize for his series. Titus died of a heart attack at age 36, just as he was on the verge of winning a major wrongful-conviction settlement. Motivated by his experience with the Titus case, Henderson left the Seattle Times in 1985 to become a private investigator. Since 1988, Henderson had been an investigator for Centurion Ministries, a small nonprofit organization based in Princeton, New Jersey dedicated to vindicating the wrongfully convicted. They have helped free more than 30 people. In addition to winning the Pulitzer, Henderson is also the winner of the C.B. Blethan Award (1977 and 1982), the Roy W. Howard Newspaper Award, Scripps-Howard Foundation (1982), and he was named an Outstanding Achiever by the American Academy of Achievement (1982). Henderson died on December 7, 2018 at the age of 79 after a battle with lung cancer.

The Pleurobranchidae are a taxonomic family of sea slugs, marine gastropod molluscs in the clade Pleurobranchomorpha.  Characteristics  Species in the family Pleurobranchidae have a prominent mantle and an internal shell that becomes reduced or is lost completely in adults. Some adult species have been seen feeding on ascidians. Larval pleurobranchids can be planktotrophic (feeding on plankton), lecithotrophic (deriving nutrition from yolk), or direct developing. Like all Pleurobranchomorpha, they breathe through an external gill, located on the right side (contrary to nudibranchs who have it on the back), just after the genital organ. Many species produce secretions from their rich glandular mantle as a chemical defense against predators. Even the production of sulfuric acid has been reported. Taxonomy Until 2005, this family was placed in the suborder Notaspidea. However, in the taxonomy of Bouchet & Rocroi (2005), the family Pleurobranchidae was placed in the superfamily Pleurobranchoidea, the only family belonging to the subclade Pleurobranchomorpha (sister to the subclade Nudibranchia), part of the clade Nudipleura. =Subfamily Pleurobranchinae= *Bathyberthella **Bathyberthella antarctica Willan and Bertsch, 1987 *Berthella de Blainville, 1824 **Berthella africana Pruvot-Fol, 1953 Cervera et al.

RDX is intended as a replacement of tape storage. RDX removable disk technology consists of portable disk cartridges and an RDX dock. RDX cartridges are shock-proof 2.5-inch Serial ATA hard disk drives and are advertised to sustain a drop onto a concrete floor and to offer an archival lifetime up to 30 years and transfer up to 650GB/hr. Hard disk cartridges capacities are 320 GB, 500 GB, 1 TB, 1.5 TB, 2 TB, 3 TB, 4 TB, and 5 TB. Solid-state cartridges' capacities run from 64 GB to 512 GB per medium, doubling each increment; or as WORM media from 320 GB to 1 TB. Dell markets RDX cartridges under the trade name RD1000; a teardown reveals they contain a standard laptop drive enclosed with silicone bumpers, but the drive cannot be accessed if removed from the cartridge and interfaced by another means. RDX is sometimes compared with Iomega REV, a formerly competing technology. Both technologies allow an ordinary user to remove and replace the cartridge containing the recording medium without special training. However REV places the read/write heads in the drive instead of inside the cartridge, which means that the drive's loading/unloading mechanism must mechanically insert heads into and remove them from the cartridge through a physical hole. By eliminating the need for this, RDX turns the drive into a dock—whose loading mechanism simply establishes an electronic connection to the cartridge.

Life and musical career Thomas is a classically trained musician whose first instrument was the violin. Born into a diverse family, (her father is a Syrian Orthodox minister, her mother a physicist), Thomas started writing her own music at the age of 11, and went on to tour and support John Cale, The Fall, James, Radiohead, Sam Philips, the Neville Brothers and Rufus Wainwright, among others. She has released work under her own name and under the pseudonym, Iroquois Falls. Thomas is known as much for her visceral, kinetic live performances as her diverse musical catalogue that has earned critical acclaim and comparisons from Bob Dylan to Tom Waits, Lydia Lunch to Sonic Youth. Thomas released her first solo record In the Throes of the Microscope (1996) in her hometown of Montreal to rave reviews. Recorded live off the floor in 24 hours with engineer/producer Glen Robinson, the disc was an introduction to the raw energy of the many years of live shows that had preceded its making. Following its release, Thomas relocated to Toronto where she quietly wrote the experimental, cinematic Armageddon Weather Channel (1998). Armageddon Weather Channel was a deliberate inquiry into form; its songs shifted into unusual time signatures and played with darker moods and structural abstraction. Musical contributors included Ian Ilavsky (CST Records, Silver Mt. Zion) who played on three tracks. Despite a notable lack of radioplay or distribution, the disc's \\"peak expression of one of rock's aggressively elemental forms\\" met with critical acclaim from critics across Canada. The considerably more accessible Songs for Car Commercials was released in 2002 to increasing commercial interest and an expanded tour schedule that included several tours and festival performances in the US and the UK. The shows for Songs for Car Commercials featured Thomas playing guitar and singing to a host of sequencers, old analog cassette recorders and looping toys. The performances, billed as \\"Girl with Guitar and Beatbox\\", were \\"near epileptic,\\" \\"audacious,\\" \\"like a wind up toy from hell.\\" You and Me Against the World Baby, released in 2006 by IRL (UK), marked a departure from its predecessor. Mixed in the UK by Paul Cartledge, its sonic assault and lyrical literacy were captured onstage by a five piece band that toured the UK, Europe and Canada. Vancouver's Georgia Straight ranked You and Me Against the World Baby alongside releases by Neko Case and Cat Power as one of the Top Ten Records of 2006. The innovative cut and paste animated video for \\"Motherfucking West\\" was presented in 2007 as part of the International Music Video Festival in Berlin, Amsterdam, Tokyo and New York City. In 2008, Priya Thomas is Blood Heron (Renovation Tracks) was released by Sunny Lane Records to widespread critical acclaim in the US and Canada. \\"All blood, guts and jugular veins,\\" Blood Heron's raw, idiosyncratic folk rock songs made with broken two-string ukuleles, pots and pans and wooden spoons earned disc of the week in Canada's Globe and Mail and several other dailies and weeklies. Enlisting the help of drummer/producer Stephen Pitkin (Elliott Brood) to realize its final sound, Blood Heron's \\"incredibly spare but powerful,\\" \\"half-broken songs\\" earned comparisons to Bob Dylan, Lou Reed, Robert Fripp, Lucinda Williams, Patti Smith, Bruce Springsteen and Tom Waits. In 2012, Thomas regrouped to form an experimental project called Iroquois Falls. A limited edition 7\\" EP on yellow vinyl entitled Twice-Born-Once-From-A-Gun was released by Toronto label Hi- Scores on March 21, 2012. The video for the singles, \\"Hey Annie (Twice-Born- Once-from-a-Gun)\\" and \\"The Magician's Niece\\" previewed on NME.com, garnering solid reviews from Interview Magazine and Magnet for its jarring din of guitars and vocals, and lomography meets Andy Warhol visuals. Dance Thomas is also a classically trained dancer and choreographer who studied under Priyamvada Sankar in Montreal, Quebec. Sankar, the eldest daughter of eminent Sanskrit scholar V. Raghavan, was also the first student of the legendary T. Balasaraswati with whom Sankar trained for nineteen years at the Madras Music Academy. Thomas performed her arangetram (a full length recital that marks formal initiation into stage performance) in 1983 and continued to study Bharata Natyam with Sankar until 1995, performing regularly in Canada, the US and India. Thomas also studied Carnatic vocal music (1980-1995) and Sanskrit with Priyamvada Sankar (1993-1995). Thomas has choreographed and performed in contemporary dance pieces, most notably collaborating with Hari Krishnan, (artistic director of InDance) and Devraj Patnaik (co-founder of Chitralekha Odissi Dance Creations) on the piece \\"Three Equals One of Whatever Happens\\" which was commissioned by Dusk Dances, Toronto. Following the loss of her close friend and musical supporter, John Michael Auden McVey to suicide in March 2009, Thomas returned to movement work and choreographic practices. Having completed her yoga teacher training in 2010 at YogaSpace Toronto, she founded the widely read online yoga magazine, Shivers Up the Spine: The Yoga Examiner which bridges streams of practice and research on modern yoga through conversations with scholars, teachers and writers from around the globe. She continues to teach and practice ashtanga yoga in Toronto. Scholarly work Thomas earned her B.A in Religious Studies at McGill University, and an M.A from York University. Her MA thesis, a full-length documentary film of Kathakali choreographer Richard Tremblay entitled, Regular Events of Beauty was nominated by the Faculty of Fine Arts for a York University thesis prize in 2002. Currently completing a PhD in Dance Studies at York University, Thomas' doctoral research offers a posthuman prehistory of the monstrous, nonhuman other in European theatrical performance. She is the recipient of several research awards including a multi-year fellowship from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, the W. Lawrence Heisey Award for scholarly achievement in the Fine Arts, the Evelyn Carnie Rowe Award for research in Canadian dance, the Iris Garland Award (2012) from the Canadian Society of Dance Studies, the Selma Jeanne Cohen Award (honorable mention) by the Society for Dance History Scholars (2013) and the Outstanding Graduate Research Award by the Congress of Research in Dance (2013).

The station is located off Bridge Street (Route 107) near its interchange with North Street (Route 114) at the north end of downtown Salem, Massachusetts. The station has a single accessible full-length high-level platform serving the single track of the Eastern Route. Just south of the station is the Salem Tunnel, which carries the line under Washington Street. Salem is a major park and ride center, with a 700-space parking garage, as well as an MBTA bus terminal. It is the busiest commuter rail station in the MBTA system outside of the central Boston stations, with an average of 2,326 daily boardings in a 2018 count. The Eastern Railroad opened between Salem and East Boston in August 1838. The first passenger accommodations were a ticket office and waiting room inside a warehouse; a wooden station was soon built. An extension to Ipswich (including the Salem Tunnel) and a branch to Marblehead opened in December 1839. In December 1847, the railroad opened a massive castle-like stone station designed by Gridley James Fox Bryant. The opening of the Essex Railroad in 1847, followed by the South Reading Branch Railroad and the Salem and Lowell Railroad in 1850, made Salem a major railroad junction. A yard with a roundhouse and coaling tower was built in the wye between the Eastern and the Essex. The Boston and Maine Railroad (B&M;) controlled the Eastern and the other lines meeting at Salem by 1887. In the late 1940s, the B&M; and the state began a three-part project to eliminate grade crossings in the downtown area. Overpasses for Bridge Street and North Street, the former acting as an extension of the tunnel, were completed in the early 1950s. The B&M; began demolition of the station in October 1954 to make way for a southward expansion of the tunnel to eliminate the last two grade crossings. The extended tunnel opened in August 1958 along with a new station, which had platforms in the trench south of the tunnel and a brick station building at street level. Service on the branch lines connecting to Salem declined in the 20th century, with the final branch service to Marblehead ending in 1959. In January 1965, the 1964-formed Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) began subsidizing some B&M; suburban service, including the Eastern Route. After a fire destroyed the bridge to Beverly in November 1984, the former rail yard at the north end of the tunnel was used as a temporary station to connect to buses, which replaced the northern branches of the line until December 1985. In August 1987, as part of a larger project to improve the line, the MBTA opened an accessible permanent station at the site, replacing the non-accessible station to the south. After years of planning, construction of the parking garage and new platform began in June 2013. The garage and part of the platform opened in October 2014, with construction continuing into 2015. Proposals by the MBTA and the city of Peabody have called for passenger service to be restored from Salem to Peabody and Danvers. Station layout The station is located on a triangular plot of land at the north end of downtown Salem, bordered by Bridge Street (Route 107) on the south, the MBTA track on the east, and the North River on the northwest. The station is fully accessible; a curved -long high- level side platform serves the single track of the Eastern Route on which the Newburyport/Rockport Line runs. Just south of the station, the track enters the -long Salem Tunnel, which runs under Washington Street through the downtown area. A preserved interlocking tower is located near the tunnel portal. alt=A city bus waiting at a sidewalk The eastern half of the site is occupied by a 700-space, five-story parking garage. A bicycle cage and passenger waiting room are located on the first floor of the garage. A footbridge connects the garage and platform to Bridge Street. The western half of the site includes a surface parking lot, a kiss-and-ride lane, a busway and taxi lane, and an access road from Bridge Street. The single track of the freight-only Peabody Branch parallels the river on the northwest. Salem serves as a terminal for six MBTA bus routes serving Salem, Danvers, Peabody, and Beverly: * : Salem Depot– * : Salem Depot– * : North Beverly Station–Salem Depot * : Salem Depot–Wonderland station * : Salem Depot–Central Square, Lynn * : Danvers Square–Salem Depot History=First station= alt=A drawing of a 19th-century city street with a single railroad track running down it. A Greek temple-like station spans the track. After the railroads from Boston to Lowell, Worcester, and Providence were chartered in 1830 and 1831, railroads to other surrounding cities including Newburyport and Portsmouth were soon proposed. The Eastern Railroad was chartered on April 14, 1836. Work began at East Boston in late 1836; construction was slowed by the Panic of 1837 and did not reach Salem until 1838. Service from Salem to East Boston began on August 27, 1838, with fares half that of competing stagecoaches. A wooden train shed was built at Salem; since it was not certain whether the line would be extended, the shed was closed at the north end. Passenger accommodations were initially limited to a ticket office and waiting room in a nearby warehouse. A wooden station similar to those at Lynn and East Boston was soon constructed near Norman Street, with bells imported from Spanish churches. The two-story station had three pairs of columns mimicking a Greek temple, a common style for the earliest stations in the northeast United States. Within days of opening, the line was already seeing commuter traffic from Salem, and it has been a heavily used commuter stop since. With the railroad receiving more traffic than expected, a branch line from Salem to Marblehead opened on December 10, 1839, replacing a stagecoach connection from Marblehead station on the mainline. Salem was the terminus of the Eastern Railroad until December 18, 1839, when the extension to Ipswich opened as the first phase of the line's completion to Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The extension to Ipswich included a tunnel under Washington Street in Salem - one of the nation's first railroad tunnels. At the time, it was among the largest granite structures in New England. The unlit tunnel was \\"happily known as the 'Kissing-Bridge' of this route, and the locale of more than one bright osculatory poem.\\" =Second station= alt=A castle-like railway station with a broad arch over the two tracks On June 16, 1846, the Eastern Railroad stockholders authorized the sale of $450,000 of new stock to fund various branch lines plus new depots at Salem and Lynn. Gridley James Fox Bryant designed a massive stone structure, one of his first major commissions. Eastern president D.A. Neal requested the style after being inspired by a similar station - possibly English, possibly the 1844-built Leipzig Thüringer Bahnhof - during a European trip. The Washington Street side of the new station had two towers, resembling those of a medieval castle, flanking a granite archway which spanned three tracks. The wooden trainshed was constructed to the south, partially on piers over the South River (which was not filled until the 1880s). A massive sea wall was built to protect the station from flooding. The station opened on December 1, 1847. In 1851, Nathaniel Hawthorne described the station in The House of the Seven Gables: alt=see caption. The first of the Essex Railroad from Salem west to Danvers opened on January 19, 1847, with a wye connecting to the Eastern Railroad at the north end of the tunnel, and the remainder to North Andover in 1848. The South Reading Branch Railroad and the Salem and Lowell Railroad (a subsidiary of the Lawrence and Lowell Railroad) opened in 1850 and used the Essex's tracks between Peabody and Salem. The South Reading Branch was built to compete with the Eastern for Boston-Salem traffic; it connected to the rival Boston and Maine Railroad (B&M;) at South Reading (Wakefield Junction). The Salem and Lowell and the South Reading Branch shared a station at the north end of the tunnel rather than using the Eastern's station, even after the Eastern acquired the South Reading Branch in 1851. The Salem and Lowell extended north from the station to the Salem Harbor Branch, which intermittently served a coal port. With direct connections to most of the major cities of northeastern Massachusetts by 1850, Salem became a major railroad junction. By the 1870s, a roundhouse, coaling tower, and water tank were located inside the wye to serve the three lines from the west. This was expanded into a large repair shop; the roundhouse was later rebuilt with more stalls and access from the south to serve commuter trains. A large freight yard was located south of downtown. Other minor passenger stations were located in Salem at various times: Carltonville on the Essex Railroad, Castle Hill (Atlantic) at the junction of the Eastern and the Marblehead Branch, Pickman Park on the Eastern, and Loring Avenue and Forest River on the Marblehead Branch. On April 7, 1882, a fire resulting from an explosion of a can of fusees destroyed the wooden trainshed, although the granite facade and towers were intact. A wooden replacement was built around the burnt section. On December 2, 1884, the Eastern was acquired by the B&M.; When the B&M; acquired the Boston and Lowell Railroad (which by then owned the Salem and Lowell) in 1887, it controlled all lines serving Salem. For much of the early 20th century, Salem was the turnback point for a limited number of short turn trains. The tunnel flooded on several occasions, including 1898 and 1927, due to during high tides and storm surges on the North River. (second page) Railroad traffic began declining after World War I due to competition from streetcars and private automobiles. Passenger service on the South Reading Branch, largely redundant after the B&M; consolidation, ended on January 2, 1926. Service on the eastern part of the Salem and Lowell ended in 1932. Passenger service on the Essex was cut back to Salem–Danvers in 1926; that service lasted until massive B&M; service cuts on May 18, 1958. Marblehead service was halved to one daily round trip during the 1958 cuts, and cut entirely on June 14, 1959. For a brief period, Portsmouth trains were combined with Rockport trains at Salem. =New tunnel and station= alt=See caption. By the 1940s, the grade crossings at Norman Street and Mill Street bracketing the depot, plus Bridge Street (Route 107) and North Street (Route 114) nearby, had long been a nuisance and hazard in the busy downtown. A plan to lengthen the tunnel and demolish the station received Works Progress Administration funds in 1938, but it was not enacted. In 1949, then-mayor Joseph B. Harrington called the crossings \\"the worst hazard in any city in the United States.\\" (The B&M; had previously proposed an electrified four-track tunnel in 1910 as part of plans to quadruple-track and grade-separate the Eastern Route from Boston to Beverly. (part 2, part 3) However, these plans were left unfulfilled after New Haven Railroad control of the B&M; ended in 1914; only a section at Lynn was built.) Construction of a $2.5 million overpass to carry Bridge Street over the railroad was begun in 1948 and completed in 1951. It effectively extended the tunnel northwards by , with separate north portals for the Eastern Route mainline and the Danvers Branch (ex-Essex Railroad). A $1.35 million overpass carrying North Street over the Danvers Branch was completed around 1953. The third part of the project was a $6 million southward extension of the tunnel to Mill Street, for a total length of about . The original tunnel was the only remaining single-track section between Boston and Newburyport; despite a push from the mayor, the B&M; declined to widen it to two tracks. The B&M; decided to demolish the old station over the protests of local preservationists, who wished to see the facade reused as the entrance to an underground station or as a museum. (part 2, part 3) Demolition began on October 22, 1954 and lasted for months. Service through Salem was maintained during the entire project; temporary platforms near the former station were used after demolition. A -long dike was constructed along the north waterfront to prevent recurrences of the previous North River floods. (Despite this, the tunnel flooded in 1961 and 1976 from broken city water mains.) The north part of the new tunnel was constructed just to the west of the south part of the old tunnel. Beginning in May 1957, the roof of the old tunnel was removed to allow the two to be connected. Trains began using the new tunnel and station on August 1, 1958, though construction was not yet complete. (part 2) Located south of Mill Street, the station had two -long side platforms in the trench at the southern portal of the new tunnel. A one-story brick station building was constructed on the west side of the tracks. Stairs connected the platforms to a footbridge behind the station building, as well as to Mill Street. The former station area was paved over as Riley Plaza, named after Medal of Honor recipient John Phillip Riley, with some 400 parking spaces. A three-day celebration was held on June 5–7, 1959 to celebrate the completion of the project. (part 2) The lengthy construction, during which many business on Washington Street were difficult to reach, resulted in at least 17 of them going bankrupt; however, business increased soon after the project was completed.

On January 18, 1965, the MBTA began subsidizing service on the Eastern Route through Salem to Hamilton/Wenham and Manchester. (These were extended to Ipswich and Rockport that June.) On December 27, 1976, the MBTA bought the B&M; commuter rail lines and equipment, including the Eastern Route. The line became known as the Ipswich/Rockport Line (after the 1998 resumption of service to Newburyport, the Newburyport/Rockport Line). Because the newer tunnel was less tall than the original, the B&M; was forced to move certain high freight cars over the Danvers Branch and the Topsfield Branch. This was the case until November 16, 1984, when a fire destroyed the wooden railroad bridge over the Danvers River between Salem and Beverly. The MBTA constructed a temporary station over the weekend in the former B&M; yard at North Street; 280 parking spots were added. Shuttle buses serving Ipswich met curtailed Boston–Salem trains there; shuttle buses from Beverly (serving Rockport–Beverly shuttle trains) met trains at Thorndike Street near the bridge. (second page) On January 7, 1985, Rockport shuttle trains were discontinued and all bus/train connections were made at North Street. Passenger service to Beverly and beyond over the new bridge began on December 1, 1985. However, freight service was not resumed over the new bridge. Pan Am Railways still operates limited freight service through Salem via the tunnel, using the ex-Essex and ex-South Reading to reach industry in Peabody. In 1984, the MBTA began a $160 million project to rebuild the Rockport and Ipswich lines. A new Salem station was constructed at the north end of the tunnel where the temporary station had been. It included a mini-high platform which made the station accessible. (The old station, located in a trench, would have been difficult to retrofit for accessibility.) The new station, with 235 dedicated parking spaces, opened on August 10, 1987. Bus routes that previously terminated in downtown Salem were extended to the new station that September. The old station building remains extant; its exterior was heavily modified in 2003 for use as a restaurant, and it was converted to a private school in 2006. Garage alt=An unearthed stone circle Parking was formerly available in a 340-space surface lot adjacent to the platform, which filled before the end of morning rush hour. The MBTA first considered the construction of a parking garage in August 1988. In October 1997, Salem was identified as a possible site for a parking garage. The project was cancelled in 1998 because of concerns by the city about the design. In 2003, the MBTA again began studying construction of a parking garage. In 2004, Salem was ranked as one of three highest-priority parking expansions on the system. Funding for the garage was committed in October 2009. As part of environmental mitigation for increased urban auto traffic enabled by the Big Dig, the state was required to add 1,000 parking spaces to MBTA stations by the end of 2011. Garages at Salem and Beverly Depot were originally to fill this requirement, but when it became clear that neither would be finished in 2011, additional parking at Wonderland, Woodland, Savin Hill, the Quincy ferry terminal, and a surface lot at Beverly Depot were used to satisfy it. However, planning continued for a garage and new platform at Salem. Funding was provided by the Federal Transit Administration ($3.6 million), the Massachusetts Department of Capital Asset Management ($3 million to reserve 150 spaces for the Essex County Courthouse), the City of Salem, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the MBTA. Planners initially considered a garage of up to 750 spaces; after various changes, the five-story garage was built with 714 spaces. alt=A construction site with low concrete walls in place Major planning was completed in 2012, with community input leading to the addition of brick facades to match local architecture, as well as an indoor waiting room. On August 24, 2012, the Massachusetts Executive Office of Environmental Affairs granted the MBTA an exemption to the mandatory Environmental Impact Assessment, as the project was to be built entirely over an existing parking lot and was thus unlikely to have negative environmental effects. Besides the garage, the project included the construction of a standard -long high-level platform for faster and fully accessible level boarding, as well as rehabilitation of the 1900-built interlocking tower. The project was originally to cost $37 million, but increased to $44.5 million due to changes mandated by new earthquake codes, the brick facades, and a roof for the pedestrian walkway. In early 2012, engineers found the remains of the roundhouse using ground penetrating radar while examining the site in preparation for the new parking garage. In November 2012, the MBTA closed part of the existing parking lot to excavate the remains, as required by the state Historical Commission. The Historical Commission unearthed the roundhouse foundation in early December 2012. A $32.5 million construction contract was awarded on December 8, 2012. The parking lot closed on July 20, 2013 for construction; a free lot opened later at the nearby former Universal Steel. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on September 13, 2013. alt=A short footbridge leading to a brick-faced parking garage After several months of foundation work, construction of the garage itself began in May 2014. The garage and the first section of the high-level platform opened on October 24, 2014. A ribbon- cutting ceremony was held on November 17, 2014. Remaining work on the project - including the north half of the platform, the bus loop, passenger drop-off areas, traffic lights, and bike paths - lasted into the first half of 2015. In January 2015, a \\"Pedal and Park\\" secure bike cage with racks for at least 100 bikes opened. This was the first such installation at an MBTA station without rapid transit service. By September 2015, the Salem garage was averaging 413 cars on weekdays. The Bridge Street lot reopened on October 16, 2015. The high-level platform was replaced in segments in May and June 2016, as some parts been built with a higher cross slope than the ADA allows. The rework was done at the contractor's expense, as the MBTA's plans specified the correct lower slope. The waiting room had a tendency to flood during severe rains, a problem which the MBTA and the contractor began fixing in 2016 by adding a glass panel and new caulking. According to a 2018 ridership count, Salem is the busiest commuter rail station in the MBTA system outside of the central Boston stations, with an average of 2,326 daily boardings. Although parking demand at Salem is high, approximately half of riders walk or bike to the station from nearby neighborhoods. Before the garage project, access via the footbridge at Washington Street was inconvenient for many of these passengers, particularly those coming from areas northwest of the station via North Street and southwest via Bridge Street. Reaching the station from these areas or an off-street lot along Bridge Street often involved crossing at an unsignalised crosswalk with poor visibility around a curve. Unofficial trails paralleling the two streets from the parking lot entrance were used by many pedestrians, but these routes were not accessible and involved trespassing on private land and/or the lightly used freight tracks. Following a 2013 city study that recommended constructing sidewalks and gated track crossings along these desire lines to enhance pedestrian access, accessible track crossings were installed on both sides on North Street to allow pedestrians to avoid the bridge. However, an official pedestrian route following the unofficial path north of the platform to the nearby Jefferson at Salem Station development was ruled out in March 2013 due to safety concerns, as it would have crossed the much busier mainline track. Future alt=A fenced-off tunnel portal with no tracks The MBTA has contemplated adding a branch line from Salem through Peabody, terminating near the Northshore Mall or the Danversport area of Danvers. While the right of way to Peabody would be shared with existing freight service, the routes beyond that involve restoring tracks on the Salem and Lawrence Railroad or the Essex Railroad, both of which have been unused for decades. In 2004, the MBTA classified the branch line as a \\"Medium Term\\" proposal with an 11-to-20-year time frame for implementation. In comparison, the new parking garage and rehabilitation of the current station were classed \\"Short Term\\" and were completed in 2014. The former branch portal created by the 1951-built overpass is still intact and may be reused if the line reopened. An easement for the connection to the Danvers Branch was maintained in early designs for the garage, but may have been obstructed by the garage as built. A 2018 study of rail service to Peabody called for a Salem–Peabody shuttle service, requiring passengers to transfer at Salem for service to Boston.

History The Francie and Josie concept first appeared on The Five Past Eight Show in the Alhambra Theatre Glasgow during the 1958 season, and was a brainwave of Stanley Baxter, Stan Mars and Rikki Fulton. Over the season the idea grew and they refined the concept. Often there would be a sketch from Francie alone and a sketch from Josie alone and then the two together at the end. In 1962 Scottish Television gave them their own show, The Adventures of Francie and Josie which also starred Clement Ashby, Glen Michael, and Ethel Scott (first wife of Rikki Fulton). The show became a hit, being broadcast by Anglia, Border Television, Grampian Television, Tyne Tees and UTV, and resulted in the pair appearing at the opening of many British Relay TV rental shops. The opening of their first shop, in Airdrie, caused such mayhem that crowds smashed the shop windows. In 1965 the last series was produced, with the pair returning to The Five Past Eight Show the following year. Both Jack Milroy and Rikki Fulton were given their own show on Scottish Television. The double act toured around Scotland and also created a Panto. During 1970 the pair did a successful tour around Northern Ireland. In 1970 they released an LP called Francie & Josie on PYE Golden Guinea.  Episodes  Over its course, 32 episodes were made between 1962 and 1965.

Much of Scottish Television's early output was wiped, and recorded over, a common practice in the television industry at the time.#. Characters * Francie McKenzie — Francie is seen as the less intelligent one of the pair but overrules Josie by telling jokes. He's more interested in \\"birds\\". He would often burst into laughter in the middle of Josie telling a story at something Josie says. The things he laughs at are usually not funny. Example: Josie: \\"I couldnae get a hud o' that Chinese waiter, ye know, the one wi' the funny walk.\\" (Walk/Wok) * Josie Tierney — Josie is the more intelligent one of the pair. He's interested in talking about culture and politics where Francie usually laughs at him. He would often muddle up his words to mean something utterly different. Example: Josie: \\"There's no wonder that Glasgow has been decimated the city of architecture.\\" * Auntie Jessie — Auntie Jessie is the somewhat dumb woman who looked after Francie and Josie after both of their families left their homes. She's usually mentioned a lot in the stage shows and has been played on stage by Mary Lee Milroy. * Glen Michael — Glen Michael played many parts on the show, including Josie's cousin when Jack Milroy was ill. * Pen-pal: - The original sketches would start with an appearance by Francie's unnamed American pen-pal (called \\"Teenager\\" in the scripts), who referred to the duo as \\"Francis and Joseph\\" and puzzled over the Glaswegian slang in his letters. She was played by Fulton's wife, Ethel Scott. Revivals After success of the television series, the duo returned to the stage. Fulton suggested that he take over as scriptwriter as Mars was moving on to America. The latter agreed and gave Fulton licence to write the scripts. Two revival shows were recorded at the King's Theatre, Glasgow, reuniting Fulton and Milroy; Francie and Josie (1989), which was broadcast on BBC Scotlandhttps://web.archive.org/web/19981202185038/http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/75years/prog.shtml, and The Farewell Performance (1996), which was direct-to-video. In 2015 a show called Francie & Josie: The Return toured Scotland starring Liam Dolan as Francie and Johnny Mac as Josie (credited as playing Milroy and Fulton, respectively).

History of the Corn Exchange The building (constructed in 1874) was designed to be a concert venue and meeting space, as well as a place of business. The basement contained offices, cloakrooms, kitchen, hall keepers room and dining rooms. The build took two years and the total cost was £9,000. It replaced the 'Floral Hall' building across St Paul's Square which had been constructed in 1849. The BBC Symphony Orchestra used the Corn Exchange between September 1941 and July 1945 for public concerts which were broadcast to the nation. The BBC Music and Religious Departments moved to Bedford when it became too dangerous for them to be based in London or their wartime home, Bristol. Around 400 musicians, staff and engineers moved to the town during World War Two. In 1944, the BBC Proms came to Bedford. Since their birth they had been performed in The Queen's Hall in London which was destroyed by bombs on 10 May 1941. They moved to the Royal Albert Hall until that too became in danger and they transferred to the Corn Exchange for the rest of the 1944 season. The Corn Exchange played host to many star names during World War Two including Glenn Miller, Bing Crosby, Marlene Dietrich, Vera Lynn, Bob Hope, Humphrey Bogart, Gracie Fields, David Niven and Yehudi Menuhin. During this time the Corn Exchange was also used as an Armed Forces Canteen. The Harpur Suite, part of the Corn Exchange complex In 1995, the Philharmonia Orchestra began a residency at the Corn Exchange. It is still one of the homes of the orchestra today. Today The Bedford Corn Exchange is a multi-purpose venue holding over 800 events per year. These include concerts, comedians, singers, council meetings and corporate events. Performers at the venue for the Spring 2013 season include Marcus Brigstocke, Joe Calzaghe, Chas & Dave, The Drifters, Hawkwind, Lee Hurst, Jimeoin, Milton Jones, Russell Kane, Sean Lock, Showaddywaddy and the Philharmonia Orchestra.

In his 1926 autobiography, \\"The Spell of the Turf,\\" Hall of Fame trainer Sam Hildreth wrote that Shilling was the greatest rider he ever saw. A native of Texas, Carroll Shilling was frequently referred to as \\"Cal.\\" He began riding at an early age on bush tracks in the Southwestern United States and embarked on a professional riding career in 1904. The following year he moved to compete at racetracks in the New York and New Jersey areas. In 1910, he was the United States Champion Jockey by earnings. Shilling would also ride in Canada for the prominent stable owned by liquor magnate, Joseph E. Seagram, winning a number of important races including what became one of the Canadian Classic Races, the Breeders' Stakes. Kentucky Derby During his career, Carroll Shilling had two mounts in the Kentucky Derby. He finished second aboard Miami in the 1909 edition then in the 1912 race rode Worth to victory in what the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame describes as probably his most dramatic win. Personal problems and ban from racing On November 19, 1909, The New York Times reported that Carroll Shilling severely stabbed stable owner R. L. Thomas after the two got into an argument at Sheepshead Bay Race Track. In the Spring of 1910, The Jockey Club set aside Shilling's application for a jockey license. The Hart–Agnew Law, legislation outlawing parimutuel betting, was passed by the New York Legislature which resulted in the closure of all New York racetracks between 1911 and 1912. On November 2, 1911, The New York Times reported that Carroll Shilling and trainer Sam Hildreth had sailed to England aboard the RMS Mauretania with the intent of racing there for the stable of American owner, Charles Kohler. On January 9, 1912 The New York Times reported that Kohler was sailing to England and would apply for a license for Carroll Shilling to ride his horses there. However, that did not work out and The New York Times then reported on March 10, 1912 that Shilling would ride for Kohler's American stable under trainer, David J. Leary. In an era when jockeys commonly used dirty tactics, Carroll was notorious for his actions. In 1912, while riding at Havre de Grace Racetrack in Maryland, he was banned from racing for striking another jockey with his whip during a race. The action resulted in his riding career ending after just six full years plus two partial years when the New York racing shutdown meant there was fierce competition for jockeys at tracks outside New York state. Following his ban from riding, Carroll Shilling remained in racing as a stableman and in 1915 his application for a jockey's license was again denied. He eventually went to work for J. K. L. Ross, a major stable owner from Canada with racing and breeding operations there and in the United States. As an assistant to trainer H. Guy Bedwell, Shilling helped condition Sir Barton for his 1919 Triple Crown championship and tutored a young jockey named Earl Sande who would go on to a Hall of Fame career of his own. However, Shilling's suspension from riding remained an issue for many years. On November 11, 1920, The New York Times reported that J. K. L. Ross successfully petitioned the Maryland State Racing Commission to lift the ban on Shilling and grant him a temporary jockey's license. The Maryland Jockey Club revolted against the decision and the matter became a very major public embarrassment for racing when a mob at Pimlico Race Course, who wanted Shilling to race, attacked and beat up Maryland racing commissioner, Joseph P. Kennedy. The issue soon involved the New York Jockey Club, whose powerful president August Belmont, Jr. lined up against the attempt by J. K. L. Ross to have Carroll Shilling reinstated. The Ross stable trainer, H. Guy Bedwell, had testified before the Maryland State Racing Commission in support of Shilling and he too would become a central figure in the controversy. The April 21, 1921 issue of The New York Times quoted from a letter by August Belmont, Jr. to J. K. L. Ross saying \\"the entries of your stable will not be acceptable to this association if ex-Jockey Carroll Shilling or H. G. Bedwell is in any way connected, directly or indirectly, with the same.\\" The issue threatened the closure of Pimlico Race Course who was the only of the four Maryland racetracks who sided with the New York authorities. Maryland's Governor, Albert Ritchie, got involved as did State senator William I. Norris who acted as legal counsel for trainer Bedwell. Pimlico Race Course president Charles E. McLane then supported Bedwell and the Maryland State Racing Commission threatened to ban New York Jockey Club members from competing in Maryland. The Maryland State Racing Commission stood its ground and on June 30, 1921, amended their temporary order to grant Shilling a permanent jockey's license. However, the Maryland State Racing Commission gave in to the unrelenting political pressure to end the inter-state dispute and on July 9, 1921 the Commission passed a resolution that The New York Times said had the effect of making any license issued by the Commission of doubtful value because the resolution declared its licenses not to be a mandate to any of Maryland's race tracks. The effect of the resolution was that Carroll Shilling never rode again and his ordeal led to a severe drinking problem. In their May 17, 1948 edition, TIME magazine reported that in recent years he had been in and out of sanitariums. Two years later, Shilling was found dead under a horse van at Belmont Park.TIME Magazine In a short career, Carroll Shilling won 969 races and in his final three seasons, had a remarkable thirty-four percent winning percentage. In 1970, the National Museum of Racing at Saratoga Springs, New York recognized the talent of Carroll Shilling and inducted him in their Racing and Hall of Fame. References * Carroll H.

Robins, 447 U.S. 74 (1980), was a U.S. Supreme Court decision issued on June 9, 1980 which affirmed the decision of the California Supreme Court in a case that arose out of a free speech dispute between the Pruneyard Shopping Center in Campbell, California, and several local high school students (who wished to solicit signatures for a petition against United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379)..Linda Greenhouse, \\"Petitioning Upheld at Shopping Malls: High Court Says States May Order Access to Back Free Speech,\\" New York Times, 10 June 1980, A1. Case The underlying dispute began in November 1975, when a group of high school students set up a table at the Pruneyard Shopping Center in Campbell, California to seek signatures from passersby for a petition they wished to send to the United Nations (UN) following the UN's condemnation of Zionism as \\"a form of racism and racial discrimination\\". The shopping center's security guards asked them to leave because they had not obtained permission from the shopping center's owners. The students sued the shopping center for violating their rights under the First Amendment, as well as their right to \\"petition government for redress of grievances\\" under the California state constitution. The Santa Clara County Superior Court ruled against the students on the basis of Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner , in which the U.S. Supreme Court had refused to find a First Amendment right of freedom of speech on others' private property. The Supreme Court of California reversed the superior court and ruled in favor of the students. The state supreme court held that the state constitution's rights to freedom of speech and to petition for redress of grievances operate independently of and were unaffected by the interpretation of the federal First Amendment in Lloyd. The shopping center's owner petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court, which unanimously upheld the decision of the California Supreme Court. In American constitutional law, this case established two important rules: * under the California Constitution, individuals may peacefully exercise their right to free speech in parts of private shopping centers regularly held open to the public, subject to reasonable regulations adopted by the shopping centers * under the U.S. Constitution, states can provide their citizens with broader rights in their constitutions than under the federal Constitution, so long as those rights do not infringe on any federal constitutional rights This holding was possible because California's constitution contains an affirmative right of free speech which has been liberally construed by the Supreme Court of California, while the federal constitution's First Amendment contains only a negative command to Congress to not abridge the freedom of speech. This distinction was significant because the U.S. Supreme Court had already held that under the federal First Amendment, there was no implied right of free speech within a private shopping center.Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, . The Pruneyard case, therefore, raised the question of whether an implied right of free speech could arise under a state constitution without conflicting with the federal Constitution. In answering yes to that question, the Court rejected the shopping center's argument that California's broader free speech right amounted to a \\"taking\\" of the shopping center under federal constitutional law. A \\"Please Do Not Contribute\\" sign at a California shopping center prompted by Pruneyard. After Pruneyard was narrowed by Ralphs in 2012, most signs either disappeared or were replaced with smaller signs. Footnote two of the decision quotes the relevant portions of the California Constitution, which states in Article 1, § 2 and Article 1, § 3 The vote to uphold the California decision was unanimous, although four justices disagreed with part of the reasoning in Justice William Rehnquist's opinion for the majority. Justices Thurgood Marshall, Byron White, and Lewis Powell filed separate concurring opinions. Justice Harry Blackmun filed a brief \\"statement\\" indicating that he was joining in all of Justice Rehnquist's opinion except for one sentence. Because of the Pruneyard case, people who visit shopping centers in California may regularly encounter people seeking money or attention for various causes, including charitable solicitations, qualifying petitions for amendments to the state constitution, voter registration drives, and sometimes a beggar. In turn, many shopping centers have posted signs to explain that they do not endorse the views of people exercising their right to free speech, and that if patrons do not give them money, the speakers will go away. Subsequent developments Although 39 other states have free speech clauses in their constitutions that look like California's – indeed, California borrowed its clause from a similar one in the New York Constitution – at least 13 of those states have declined to follow California in extending the right of free speech into private shopping centers. → This article is an excellent overview of Pruneyard's progeny. In refusing to follow Pruneyard, the state supreme courts of New York and Wisconsin both attacked it as an unprincipled and whimsical decision.See SHAD Alliance v. Smith Haven Mall, 488 N.E.2d 1211 (N.Y. 1985) and Jacobs v. Major, 407 N.W.2d 832 (Wis. 1987). In 2003, the European Court of Human Rights also considered and refused to follow Pruneyard, in a United Kingdom case. Only New Jersey, Colorado, and Massachusetts have followed California, albeit with some reservations. In a 2000 decision, Puerto Rico (a U.S. territory) also adopted Pruneyard's right of free speech, although the case was complicated by the presence of a branch office of a government agency (Puerto Rico Telephone, since privatized) in the shopping center (the Mayagüez Mall).Empresas Puertorriqueñas de Desarrollo, Inc. v. Hermandad Independiente de Empleados Telefónicos, 150 D.P.R. 924 (2000).. The court's decision turned on the fact that the PRT branch office in the mall was the only local PRT facility in the entire municipality where the unions could publicly demonstrate against the governor's privatization proposal. Some commentators have suggested the Pruneyard rule could be applied to speech on the Internet, including speech activities in virtual worlds, like Linden Labs' Second Life, although the courts have not addressed this theory. In the decades since Pruneyard was decided, the Supreme Court of California has become much more conservative, especially after three liberal justices (including Chief Justice Rose Bird) were removed by the electorate in 1986 after a campaign that focused upon their opposition to the death penalty. In the 2001 Golden Gateway decision, a 4–3 majority of the Court significantly narrowed Pruneyard by holding for a variety of reasons that California's free speech right does not apply to private apartment complexes – yet they also refused to overrule Pruneyard.Golden Gateway Ctr. v. Golden Gateway Tenants Ass'n, 26 Cal. 4th 1013 (2001). Thus, California's right of free speech in private shopping centers still survives. The shopping center industry strongly \\"detests\\" the Pruneyard decision since it has resulted in numerous test cases by protesters in California and elsewhere trying to find the boundaries of the Pruneyard rule.Joseph R. Grodin, Calvin R. Massey, and Richard B. Cunningham, The California State Constitution: A Reference Guide (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1993), 26. Shopping centers have regularly imposed restrictions on unwanted solicitors and appealed the resulting legal cases in the hope of convincing the California judiciary that Pruneyard should be overturned, or at least limited. Since Golden Gateway, decisions by the intermediate Courts of Appeal have generally limited the scope of the Pruneyard rule to the facts of the original case. For example, starting in 1997, the parking lots of many Costco warehouse club stores in California became sites of conflict involving a large number of political activist groups who had gradually become aware of their rights under Pruneyard. In 1998, Costco's management imposed several restrictions, including a complete ban on soliciting at stand-alone stores, a rule that no group or person could use Costco premises for free speech more than 5 days out of any 30, and the complete exclusion of solicitors on the 34 busiest days of the year. In 2002, these restrictions were upheld as reasonable by the Court of Appeal for the Fourth Appellate District, and the Supreme Court of California denied review.Costco Companies, Inc. v. Gallant, 96 Cal. App. 4th 740 (2002). Costco's stand-alone stores lacked the social congregation attributes of the multi-tenant shopping center at issue in Pruneyard. As for the restrictions on the stores in shopping centers, they were held to be reasonable because Costco had developed a strong factual record at trial which proved that hordes of unwanted solicitors had significantly interfered with its business operations – they had damaged its reputation, obstructed access to its stores, and traumatized Costco employees. In 2007, the Supreme Court of California confronted the Pruneyard decision once more, in the context of a complex labor dispute involving San Diego's Fashion Valley Mall and the San Diego Union-Tribune. On December 24, 2007, a 4–3 majority of a sharply divided court once again refused to overrule Pruneyard, and instead, ruled that under the California Constitution, a union's right of free speech in a shopping center includes the right to hand out leaflets urging patrons to boycott one of the shopping center's tenants.Fashion Valley Mall, LLC, v. National Labor Relations Board, 42 Cal. 4th 850 (2007). Justice Ming Chin, in his dissent joined by Justices Marvin Baxter and Carol Corrigan, expressed his sympathy with several of the most common critiques of the Pruneyard decision. In the aftermath of the Fashion Valley case, the California Courts of Appeal briefly began to apply Pruneyard more broadly. In 2010, the Court of Appeal for the Third Appellate District, in an opinion authored by then-Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye (now Chief Justice of California), held that it is unconstitutional under Pruneyard for shopping mall giant Westfield Group to promulgate rules discriminating in favor of commercial speech in its malls and against noncommercial speech.Snatchko v. Westfield, LLC, 187 Cal. App. 4th 469 (2010). The plaintiff had been detained by Westfield security after attempting to discuss the principles of his Christian faith with strangers at the Westfield Galleria at Roseville. In 2011, the Court of Appeal for the Second Appellate District disagreed with the Fourth Appellate District's analysis of blackout days in the Costco case, and held that it was unreasonable for Westside Pavilion to prohibit animal rights protesters from protesting on certain blackout days and to require them to protest out of aural and visual range of the targeted tenant (an alleged retailer for puppy mills).Best Friends Animal Society v. Macerich Westside Pavilion Property LLC, 193 Cal. App. 4th 168 (2011). On December 27, 2012, the Supreme Court of California reaffirmed Pruneyard but narrowed its applicability to the facts of the original case.Ralphs Grocery Co. v. United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 8, 55 Cal. 4th 1083 (2012). The entire court concurred in Associate Justice Joyce Kennard's holding that Pruneyard applies only to \\"common areas\\" of shopping centers that are designed and furnished to encourage shoppers to linger, congregate, relax, or converse at leisure, but does not apply to any other open portions of shopping centers merely intended to facilitate the efficient movement of shoppers in and out of tenants, including concrete aprons and sidewalks which shoppers simply walk across as they move between parking lots and big-box stores. In other words, the court effectively immunized most (but not all) strip malls and shopping centers from Pruneyard, except for those with areas analogous to public gathering areas such as plazas, atriums, or food courts. Miriam Vogel, a former Court of Appeal justice who argued for the shopping center tenant (Kroger subsidiary Ralphs), characterized the decision \\"a great victory for retailers as far as putting another nail in the Pruneyard coffin.\\"Scott Graham, \\"Justices Limit Shopping Mall Speech Rights, But Unions Can Still Picket,\\" The Recorder, 27 December 2012. However, the decision was not a complete loss for free speech advocates, as the court separately upheld the right of a union to protest on the employer's premises under the state Moscone Act by a 6–1 majority (the majority, though, was badly split as to why). Pruneyard has been identified as possible case law by conservative politicians in challenging the protections from liability of Internet service providers, like Facebook and Twitter, under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Section 230 immunizes such providers from liability for content generated by their users, as well as for decisions to remove or moderate content they deem objectionable, language which has enabled the Internet to flourish since its passage in 1996. In the years leading up to and after Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, conservatives claimed that Internet sites were unfairly moderating against their viewpoints and have sought ways to try to weaken Section 230 as applied to sites allegedly engaged in nonneutral practices. Pruneyard has been cited in litigation by conservatives seeking to coerce Internet sites to cease moderation or restrictions on their content, such as in a 2019 case of PragerU seeking to stop YouTube from demonetizing its videos, by equating such sites as the equivalent of shopping malls, but these attempts have been so far rejected by courts. Nevertheless, Trump himself cited Pruneyard in Executive Order 13925, \\"Preventing Online Censorship\\", signed in May 2020, which seeks to modify the application of Section 230.

History The company was first organized in 1925 in Newport, Oregon, under the name of Bank of Newport. In 1995, Bank of Newport merged with Commercial Bank of Salem, Oregon. In 1999, after acquisitions of the Bank of Vancouver (of Vancouver, Washington), and Centennial Bank of Olympia, Washington, the new entity changed its name to West Coast Bank. In October 2009, the company raised $155 million in additional capital, but also received a warning about its lending practices from federal and state regulators. Columbia Bank System of Tacoma, Washington, and West Coast announced on September 26, 2012, that Columbia would purchase West Coast in a cash-and-stock deal worth $506 million. It had traded on the NASDAQ as WCBO. Operations West Coast Bank offered savings, checking, money market, CD, and NOW accounts in addition to credit cards.

Texas, 550 U.S. 297 (2007), was a United States Supreme Court case about a challenge to a Texas death penalty court procedure. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the opinion of the Court, holding 5-4 that the Texas procedure was improper. Justice Samuel Alito wrote a dissent.  Background  LaRoyce Lathair Smith was convicted of capital murder in the 1991 murder of a Dallas Taco Bell employee. He was sentenced to death by a jury in Dallas County, Texas. In 2004, the Supreme Court overturned his death sentence because of an improper jury instruction and sent the case back to Texas state court.See Smith I, . After the case was remanded, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that Smith’s pre-trial objections did not preserve the claim of constitutional error he asserted. \\"Under the Texas framework for determining whether an instructional error merits reversal, the state court explained, this procedural default required Smith to show egregious harm — a burden the court held he did not meet.\\"Smith II, 550 U.S. at ___ (2007). Smith appealed, and the Court granted certiorari. Smith's attorneys for the appeal included four retired federal appeals court judges. The case was argued before the Supreme Court on January 16, 2007, with UT Austin Professor Jordan Steiker appearing for Smith and Texas Solicitor General Ted Cruz appearing for the state, with Gene Schaerr appearing for the State of California as a friend of Texas.https://www.oyez.org/cases/2006/05-11304 Decision=Issue= The Court granted certiorari on two issues. #Was the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals correct in holding that the improper jury instruction was harmless error and not sufficient to invalidate his death sentence? #Was the Texas court correct to require a standard of \\"egregious harm\\" when evaluating whether an unconstitutional jury instruction should invalidate a death sentence? =Opinion of the Court= On April 24, 2007, the Supreme Court reversed and remanded. Justice Kennedy, writing for the 5-4 majority, held that the Texas Court \\"misunderstood the interplay of [previous death penalty decisions,] and it mistook which of Smith’s claims furnished the basis for this Court’s opinion in Smith I. These errors of federal law led the state court to conclude Smith had not preserved at trial the claim this Court vindicated in Smith I, even when the Court of Criminal Appeals previously had held Smith’s claim ... was preserved. The state court’s error of federal law cannot be the predicate for requiring Smith to show egregious harm.\\" Having resolved the second issue in Smith's favor, the Court did not address the first issue. =Concurrence= Justice Souter issued a brief concurrence, adding only that \\"in some later case, we may be required to consider whether harmless error review is ever appropriate in a case with error as described in Penry v. Lynaugh. We do not and need not address that question here.\\"Internal citation omitted. =Dissent= Justice Alito dissented, stating that the issue was one of ordinary state procedure, and that Smith had indeed failed to raise any objection to the jury instruction. \\"Accordingly,\\" he wrote, \\"I would dismiss for want of jurisdiction.\\"  Subsequent developments  In 2008, one year after Smith v. Texas was decided, the subject, LaRoyce Smith, (former death row number #999007) had his sentence commuted to life imprisonment.http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/death_row/dr_offenders_no_longer_on_dr.html NotesExternal links * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court Category:United States death penalty case law Category:Capital punishment in Texas Category:2007 in Texas Category:2007 in United States case law Category:Ted Cruz ","title":"Smith v.

It is a property on both sides of the road consisting of 15 contributing properties in two distinct groups, together comprising a mostly intact early 19th-century family farm still used for that purpose today. Hait, a member of a prosperous Westchester County family, bought the original 97 acres (39 ha) in 1819. At the time the road was the busy Milton Turnpike, carrying much traffic from distilleries. Over the next nine years, he built the farm up with purchases adding , setting it into its present form. His grandson sold it in 1888. Two other owners later, in 1906, the Allhusen family after whom the road was renamed bought it for dairy farming and kept it until 1973. After some more transitional owners, it came to the Adairs, who returned to the property's roots by going into winemaking. The farm was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. They have since sold the property to Marc and Lori Stopkie, who have retained the Adair name. Today, Adair Vineyards produces 20,000 bottles annually of Seyval blanc, Vignoles, Foch and Millot, on 100 acres (40 ha). Their tasting facility is on the south side of the road east of the house. The main house, on the road a short distance from the Shuart-Van Orden Stone House, is a Federal style home built around 1825 from a mix of wood and stone, an unusual combination in that style. A frame extension of the west wing was added in the late 19th century. Originally the front was sided in clapboard with a cornice and frieze; that was replaced with cedar in the 1950s. The interior retains much of the original molding. Near the house are ancillary agricultural structures, such as a stone barn (an unusual material for the area) that appears to have built around the same time as the house, a later wood barn of an identical configuration as the first. The other group, south of the road, is centered on a New World Dutch barn, older than the main house. Originally constructed, like other Dutch barns, for wheat farming, it was adapted for winemaking around 1986. Its outbuildings include a smokehouse, icehouse and 1873 granary. An outhouse dates to the early 20th century. There is also the remains of a foundation of a late 18th or early 19th-century stone house and a well that served it.

Eisenhower, is \\"In God we trust\\". National mottoUnited States Public Law 84-851, United States Public Law 84-851. The phrase first appeared on U.S. coins in 1864.  History  The 1956 law was the first establishment of an official motto for the country, although E Pluribus Unum (\\"from many, one\\") was adopted by an Act of Congress in 1782 as the motto for the Seal of the United States and has been used on coins and paper money since 1795. A phrase similar to \\"In God we trust\\" appears in the final stanza of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\". Written in 1814 by Francis Scott Key (and later adopted as the U.S. national anthem on March 3, 1931 by U.S. President Herbert Hoover), the song contains an early reference to a variation of the phrase: \\"And this be our motto: 'In God is our trust.'\\"50th Anniversary of Our National Motto, \\"In God We Trust,\\" 2006, Proclamation of George W. Bush, White House. The change from \\"E Pluribus Unum\\" to \\"In God we trust\\" was generally considered uncontroversial at the time, given the rising influence of organized religion and pressures of the Cold War era in the 1950s. The 1956 law was one of several legislative actions Congress took to differentiate the United States from atheistic communism. Earlier, a 1954 act added the words \\"under God\\" to the Pledge of Allegiance.James Hudnut- Beumler, Looking for God in the Suburbs: The Religion of the American Dream and Its Critics, 1945-1965 (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1994), pp. 50-51. Some states also adopted mottos with religious overtones during this time, for example Ohio's \\"With God, all things are possible\\". The constitutionality of the modern national motto has been questioned with relationship to the separation of church and state outlined in the First Amendment. In 1970, in Aronow v. United States, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the motto does not violate the First Amendment to the Constitution. The United States Supreme Court has not ruled on the issue.

L. Duke as Paul Markstrom * Goodfella Mike G as Joey D'Angelo * Tim McAdams as Johnny Post * Steve Ryan as CO Mike Healy * Philip Scozzarella as CO Joseph Mineo * Derrick Simmons as Billy Keane Plot Augustus Hill, a wheelchair-bound prisoner and the series' narrator, introduces the audience to Cell Block 5 of the Oswald Maximum Security Penitentiary (\\"Oz\\"). Nicknamed \\"Emerald City\\" or \\"Em City,\\" the experimental block is designed to rehabilitate select inmates by allowing them certain privileges in exchange for greater surveillance. The violence of Oz is demonstrated right away as new inmate Miguel Alvarez is shanked before even being brought inside, horrifying fellow arrival Tobias Beecher. The violence upsets Em City's unit manager, Tim McManus, who asks Warden Leo Glynn to allow the cannibalistic killer Donald Groves into Em City, believing no inmate is a lost cause. Glynn reluctantly agrees on the condition that drug dealer Paul Markstrom, his own wayward cousin, be brought there as well. Correctional officer Diane Whittlesey assigns the arrivals to their \\"sponsors\\", veteran prisoners who at least nominally look after them and ensure they integrate appropriately. Groves is assigned the kindly Bob Rebadow; Markstrom's sponsor is Jefferson Keane, a fellow \\"Homeboy\\"; and Beecher is given Italian-American mobster Dino Ortolani. Ortolani is not interested in babysitting the anxious Beecher, but gives him basic pointers for surviving Oz. Glynn informs the inmates that cigarettes will be confiscated due to new state laws. Beecher is alarmed to find cellmate Simon Adebisi rifling through his possessions. Adebisi intimidates Beecher when he tries to stop it, and threatens to rape him at bedtime. An unassuming-looking prisoner named Vernon Schillinger suggests that Beecher appeal to McManus to move out of Adebisi's pod, implying that Schillinger will gladly take Beecher into his own. Unfortunately, Beecher soon realizes out Schillinger belongs to the Aryan Brotherhood and that he has just become Schillinger's \\"livestock.\\" That night, Schillinger tattoos a swastika onto a petrified Beecher's buttocks. The following morning, McManus complains about the draconian laws passed by Governor James Devlin, saying that banning cigarettes will make the inmates uncooperative. Kareem Said, a radical black Muslim leader convicted of arson, arrives at Em City. Keane and Adebisi try to intimidate Said out of his anti-drug preaching, but Said purposefully injures himself to display his determination. Ortolani, plagued by insomnia and violent flashbacks, puts in a request for a conjugal visit with his wife. Later, he is furious to find out that Irish-American hoodlum Ryan O'Reily, the victim of the assault which landed Ortolani in Oz, is coming to the same prison. Upon arriving, O'Reily sets out to arrange a hit on Ortolani. After getting into a bloody fight with gay inmate Billy Keane in the showers, Ortolani tries to flirt with Dr. Gloria Nathan in the infirmary. McManus punishes Ortolani by assigning him to work with the gay inmates in the AIDS ward. Nathan hates working with Ortolani and thinks McManus can't change people like him. Nonetheless, McManus successfully asks Nathan to dinner with him. Since Ortolani had attacked his brother, Jefferson Keane agrees to O'Reily's hit. When Ortolani reacts poorly to working in the AIDS ward, McManus vindictively cancels his conjugal visit, replacing it with a behind-the-glass visit between Ortolani and his family. Ortolani tells his wife to go on with her life as though he were dead. During Ortolani's next round in the AIDS ward, he is told by a patient named Emilio Sanchez that he wants to die. In the restroom, Ortolani and O'Reily get into a fight. That night, Ortolani suffocates Sanchez in a mercy killing and is beaten, tranquilized, and left in solitary confinement by the guards. As he is sleeping, a bribed guard lets one of Keane's henchmen, Johnny Post, pour lighter fluid on Ortolani and set him on fire. A dejected McManus examines the photos of Ortolani's corpse. Deceased * Emilio Sánchez- Suffocated by Dino Ortolani when he asked him to euthanize him and end his suffering (late stage AIDS with multiple terminal infections). * Dino Ortolani- Burned alive in his solitary confinement cell by Johnny Post on orders from Jefferson Keane to avenge Billy Keane's (his brother's) severe beating. Crime flashbacks More prominent prisoners in Oz are given a stylized \\"crime flashback,\\" narrated by Augustus Hill, depicting the crime for which they were incarcerated. The flashbacks of the debut episode were: * Tobias Beecher - driving while intoxicated and vehicular manslaughter of a minor. * Kareem Said - arson in the second degree. * Dino Ortolani - murder in the first degree and assault with a deadly weapon (Ryan O'Reily wounded). Production Creator Tom Fontana pitched the idea of Oz to the cable channel HBO after years of dissatisfaction working within the constraints of network television and their expression-limiting censoring requirements. Executive producer Barry Levinson had visited penal institutions, such as the Baltimore City Jail and the Maryland House of Correction, before when researching for his previous TV series and felt that the prison was an intimidating and scary place with many stories to tell and that a dedicated TV series about the subject matter had never been done before. HBO felt that they had had success with their previous prison-themed documentaries and decided to commission Oz as their very first hour-long dramatic series. Fontana felt extremely liberated and satisfied writing for Oz, developing graphic scenes and breaking taboos with which, he says, he would have never gotten away in network TV. HBO constructed prison sets inside a warehouse near the Manhattan's Meatpacking District. The opening credits of the show feature Tom Fontana himself getting the \\"Oz\\" tattoo.

At certain intervals, the bottle is twisted, shaken slightly and moved progressively to a vertical position with the neck pointing down. Traditionally, this used to take place manually over the course of several weeks, with wine cellar workers called remueurs performing the task on each individual bottle. A gyropalette performs the same task automatically on many bottles at the same time, and in a shorter period of time. The bottles are placed in a cage, and are moved in a way which emulates the action of a remueur by means of motors and automatic controls. The gyropalette was invented by two French vintners, Claude Cazals and Jacques Ducion, who filed for patent in 1968, but was first introduced in Spain in the mid-1970s with Cava-producer Codorníu as the first big user. Most sparkling wines produced by the traditional method, including most Champagne, is now produced using gyropalettes. The manual method is still used for some high-end wines.

A wide variety of genealogies and source material have been published in the Register for over 160 years, with an emphasis on New England. Authoritative compiled genealogies have always been a primary focus of the Register. Thousands of New England families have been treated in the pages of the journal, and many more are referred to incidentally. Typically, these articles solve a genealogical problem, identify immigrant origins, or present a full-scale treatment of multiple generations. Henry B. Hoff was appointed editor of the Register in 2001. In October 2009, an annual supplement to the Register, American Ancestors Journal, was introduced. =The Great Migration Study Project= The Great Migration Study Project is an ongoing scholarly endeavor to create short biographical sketches of all immigrants from Europe to colonial New England between 1620 and 1640 (the Puritan great migration). These number over 5,500 individuals, not including dependent wives and children, almost all of whom came from England (in a few cases after an interlude in the Netherlands). Directed by Robert Charles Anderson, the project is conducted in collaboration with the Society and has been underway since 1988. Over a dozen volumes of sketches have been published so far, covering over two thousand subjects.Robert Charles Anderson, The Great Migration Directory (Boston: NEHGS, 2015).

Their father, an English professor at a university, has decided to take a year off from teaching to write a book that he only half-jokingly claims will shake the world of literature. That means the family relocates to a small country house, and his daughters are upset at be sharing a room. Like most sisters, Meg and Molly quarrel over silly things, and Meg is jealous of her sister's blonde curls and long eyelashes. The owner of the house that the family is renting lives down the road in a smaller house on the same property. The sisters soon establish a rapport with the elderly Will Banks, who learns about photography with Meg and teaches Molly about the abundant wildflowers covering the estate. A few months after coming to the country, Molly begins having constant nosebleeds, which the doctor blames on the cold weather. Unfortunately, it is not until Molly's bed is soaked in blood that she is rushed to the hospital and diagnosed with a fatal disease: acute myelogenous leukemia. After treatment, she seems to recover slightly, but the pills that she takes cause her hair to fall out. Shortly thereafter, Ben Brady and a pregnant Maria Abbott, whom the townspeople incorrectly assume to be unmarried, arrive to make the third Banks house their home. All inhabitants of the property enjoy one another's company for a while. Then, the unthinkable happens, and Molly is rushed back to the hospital. She asks Meg to tell the baby to wait to be born until she comes home, and Meg obliges her, and she asks the baby to be born in the daytime since she was invited to take pictures of the birth. They name it Happy William Abbott-Brady. In the end, Molly dies, and the family moves back to the city. Through it all and with help from those who love her, Meg finds the jealousy that she once had for her sister has changed into pure love, and eventually, she is forced to accept that bad things happen to good people. Background Lowry drew upon her own experience of losing her sister at a young age when writing this novel, as she stated in a 2002 lecture: :\\"A Summer to Die wrenched open the excruciating door of loss. My beloved sister had died young. She was the one who had shown me how words work, using her own first- grade books, when I was three; the one who took up Cherry Ames and curlers while I stuck to my classics and unkempt pigtails and we were briefly, childishly, estranged. : :\\"My family, stoic, Wasp and Nordic, was silent after the loss. :... :Shakespeare tells us to give sorrow words. But it took me so many years to do so, coming from a tradition such as mine, which taught me not to open a door on such darkness. Having done so—having felt the weight of the closed door lifted—I began to hear from the children and families affected by the book. And only then, for the first time, did I perceive that when I, as a child, sought from stories something that I had no name for, it had simply been unquestioning intimacy I needed. A place to listen with one's heart.

She also became the first Irish woman to ascend the Himalayan peak Ama Dablam and to climb the Seven Summits—the highest mountains on each continent. In 2008, O'Leary joined the Beyond Endurance expedition led by Falvey to the South Pole, making her the first woman to successfully ski to the South Pole. In 2012, O'Leary and Mike O'Shea set out on an ongoing series of expeditions that they called the Ice Project; their aim is to cross all of the world's largest ice caps. Some of these expeditions included crossings of the Northern Patagonian Ice Field, the Greenland ice sheet, and Lake Baikal. In 2014, they plan to attempt to ski to the North Pole after their 2012 North Pole trek was cancelled due to a logistics problem; this attempt will be O'Leary's fourth and O'Shea's second. They hope to be the first Irish people to reach the North Pole. A successful trip to the North Pole would also make O'Leary the second woman to climb the Seven Summits and reach both poles.

Martinez and Silvas were arrested for the Ruby Murders after the largest manhunt in the history of the Southwest. The posse comitatus (from the Latin for \\"power of the county\\"), in common law, is a group of people mobilized by the conservator of peace – typically a sheriff – to suppress lawlessness or defend the county. The posse comitatus originated in ninth century England simultaneous with the creation of the office of sheriff. Though generally obsolete throughout the world, it remains theoretically, and sometimes practically, part of the United States legal system. Etymology The term derives from the Latin posse comitātūs (\\"force of the county\\"), in English use from the late 16th century, shortened to posse from the mid-17th century.OED, s.v. \\"posse n. 2, posse comitatus. While the original meaning refers to a group of citizens assembled by the authorities to deal with an emergency (such as suppressing a riot or pursuing felons), the term is also used for any force or band, especially with hostile intent, often also figuratively or humorously. \\"All the Posse of Hell, cannot violently eject me.\\" T. Fuller, Good Thoughts in Bad Times (1645) I. xv. 39. \\"A whole posse of the young lady's kindred – brothers, cousins and uncles – stood ready at the street door to usher me upstairs.\\" W. Beckford Portuguese Jrnl. 10 June 1787, p. 72. (cited after OED). In 19th-century usage, posse comitatus also acquired the generalized or figurative meaning.\\"I can lick the whole posser-commertatus of yer. Come on, yer cowards!\\" Harper's Magazine July 1862, 184/1 (cited after OED). In classical Latin, posse is a contraction of potesse, an irregular Latin verb meaning \\"to be able\\". Mueller, Hans- Friedrich. (2013). “Latin 101.” The Teaching Company. The unusual genitive in \\"-ūs\\" is a feature of the fourth declension. In its earliest days the posse comitatus was subordinate to king, country and local authority. United Kingdom=English Civil War= In 1642, during the early stages of the English Civil War, local forces were employed everywhere and by all sides. The powers responsible produced valid written authority, inducing the locals to assemble. The two most common authorities used were the Militia Ordinance on the side of the Parliamentarians and that of the king, the old-fashioned Commissions of Array. But the Royalist leader in Cornwall, Sir Ralph Hopton, indicted the enemy before the grand jury of the county as disturbers of the peace, and had the posse comitatus called out to expel them. =In law= The powers of sheriffs in England and Wales for posse comitatus were codified by section 8 of the Sheriffs Act 1887, the first subsection of which stated that: This permitted the sheriff of each county to call every civilian to his assistance to catch a person who had committed a felony—that is, a serious crime. It provided for fines for those who did not comply. The provisions for posse comitatus were repealed by the Criminal Law Act 1967.Schedule 3, Part III, Criminal Law Act 1967 The second subsection provided for the sheriff to take \\"the power of the county\\" if he faced resistance while executing a writ, and provided for the arrest of resisters.section 8, Sheriffs Act 1887 (as passed) This subsection is still in force.section 8, Sheriffs Act 1887 (as amended) This power can be used during the execution of a writ of seizure and sale in order to satisfy a debt; it allows a sheriff to call upon the police while seizing the property. United States The posse comitatus power continues to exist in those common law states that have not expressly repealed it by statute. As an example, it is codified in Georgia under OCGA 17-4-24: Resorting to the posse comitatus figures often in the plots of Western movies, where a body of men recruited is frequently referred to as a posse. For example, in The Magnificent Seven Ride, the protagonist recruits jailed criminals to hunt down a Mexican bandit leader. Based on this usage, the word posse has come to be used colloquially to refer to various teams, cliques, or gangs, often in pursuit of a crime suspect, sometimes without legal authority. In a number of states, especially in the Western United States, sheriffs and other law enforcement agencies have called their civilian auxiliary groups \\"posses\\". The Lattimer Massacre of 1897 illustrated the danger of such groups, and thus ended their use in situations of civil unrest. Posse comitatus in the US became not an instrument of royal prerogative, but an institution of local self-governance. The posse functioned through, rather than upon, the local popular will. From 1850 to 1878, the US Federal Government had expanded its power over individuals. This was done to safeguard national property rights for slaveholders, emancipate millions of enslaved African Americans, and enforce the doctrine of formal equality. The rise of the federal state, like the marketplace before it, had created contradictory but congruous forces of liberation and compulsion upon individuals. In the early decades of the United States, before slavery became a major conflict, federal use of posse comitatus in the states was rare and sporadic. But the federal posse comitatus, quite literally, had compelled all of the United States to accept the legitimacy of slavery. In an exhaustive study of lynching in Colorado, historian Stephen Leonard defines lynching very broadly; he includes the people's courts and even posses, which by definition were led by sheriffs.“Lynching in Colorado, 1859–1919” (University Press Colorado, 2002). Indisputably, historical records link violent lawlessness, and even lynchings, to posse comitatus. In the United States, a federal statute known as the Posse Comitatus Act, enacted in 1878, forbade the use of the US Army, and through it, its offspring, the US Air Force, as a posse comitatus or for law enforcement purposes without the approval of Congress.18 U.S.C. § 1385 While the act does not explicitly mention the US Navy and the US Marine Corps, the US Department of the Navy has prescribed regulations that are generally construed to give the act force with respect to branches as well.32 C.F.R. § 213.2 (although the Navy and Marine Corps are not included in the Posse Comitatus Act, they were made subject to it by DoD Regulation) In 2013, a directive from the US Secretary of Defense directly addresses this issue: it prohibits the use of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps for domestic law enforcement. The limitation does not apply to the National Guard of the United States when activated by a state's governor and operating in accordance with Title 32 of the US Code, such as deployments by state governors in response to Hurricane Katrina. =Notable posses=Pierce County, 1856 In response to the dispatch of militia by the Governor of Washington Territory, Isaac Stevens, to arrest Francis A. Chenoweth, the chief justice of the territory's supreme court, who was holding court in the Pierce County Courthouse, the sheriff of Pierce County deputized 50 to 60 civilians for the defense of the court. The standoff between the posse and the militia was ultimately resolved by negotiations and the latter withdrew. Luzerne County, 1897 Marking the last \\"significant\\" use of a posse, in 1897 the sheriff of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, deputized 100 civilians to supplement 50 deputy sheriffs in confronting 400 striking mine workers at the Lattimer Mines. The posse fired at the strikers leaving 19 dead. This incident is referred to as the Lattimer massacre. Hinsdale County, 1994 In 1994, after violent bank robbers fled from Mineral County, Colorado, into remote Hinsdale County, Colorado—which, at the time, had three full-time law enforcement officers for its 500 residents – the county's sheriff summoned the power of the county; more than 100 deputized civilians were directed in house to house searches for the fugitives. The robbers were killed as the posse closed on their location. =Legal status=Case law Following the Baltimore riot of 1968, 1,500 lawsuits were filed against the city of Baltimore seeking compensation for damages sustained due to the failure of the police to suppress the unrest. The city sought declaratory judgment arguing that it could not be liable for any failures of the Baltimore municipal police, as it was an agency of the State of Maryland and the city had no law enforcement authority. In rejecting the argument, the Maryland Court of Appeals observed that Baltimore, as an independent city and—therefore—a county equivalent, was still in possession of the ability to summon the power of the county as that right had not explicitly been repealed by statute and, therefore, remained part of the common law. The court noted: Statute law=State provisions= Writing in the Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, David Kopel observed that almost all US states provide statutory authority for sheriffs, or other local officials, to summon the power of the county. In many cases, civil and criminal penalties are prescribed for members of the public who shirk posse duty when summoned; South Carolina provides that \\"any person refusing to assist as one of the posse ... shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction shall be fined not less than thirty nor more than one hundred dollars or imprisoned for thirty days\\" while in New Hampshire a fine of \\"not more than $20\\" has been set. =Federal provisions= Title 42, section 1989, of the United States Code extends the authority to summon the power of the county to United States magistrate judges when necessary to enforce their orders:  See also  * Commandeering * Conscription * Ku Klux Klan raid (Inglewood) * Misprision * Vigilante  References External links * Category:Common law Category:Legal history Category:Latin legal terminology Category:History of criminal justice ","title":"Posse comitatus"},{"id":"15134845","text":"David Kirby or \\"D. K.\\" Foster (1882–1969) was a prominent Baptist minister, influential community leader in Arkansas and Missouri, and a friend and counselor to President Harry S. Truman. Biography Foster was born and raised in the former community of Pitman, in Randolph County, Arkansas. After graduating from Ouachita College in Maynard, Arkansas, Foster worked as both an educator and minister in Arkansas and Missouri. Foster eventually became pastor of the First Baptist Church of Caruthersville, Missouri, a position which he held for 27 years. Foster was an active supporter of the Democratic Party, and while he never ran for office himself, Foster had the reputation of being the \\"Reverend of 1,000 votes.\\" Many candidates for state office would seek his endorsement before making their runs. During Harry S. Truman's 1934 run for the United States Senate, Truman was virtually unknown in southeast Missouri, and what was known concerned his associations with the Pendergast machine. After being rebuffed by local Democrats, he sought the assistance of Foster, who arranged for Truman to make a speech at the Pemiscot County courthouse in Caruthersville. Truman made a very favorable impression during the speech, and Foster’s support was later credited with winning Truman the southeast Missouri vote, and perhaps the entire election for the Senate. Afterwards, Truman and Foster struck up a lifelong friendship, and Truman would visit Foster and his family during what would become yearly visits to Caruthersville. Correspondence between the two is maintained by the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum in Independence, Missouri.  References  * Geographic Names Information System (GNIS).

David M. Cheney. Retrieved January 14, 2017 History Ampurias was erected in 1113; the diocese of Cività, now Tempio, in 304 by St. Simplicius. Cività was united to Ampurias by Pope Julius II in 1506. Later the see was transferred to Terranuova. Pope Gregory XVI suppressed the cathedral there by the Bull Quamvis aqua, 26 August 1839, and raised the Collegiate Church of St. Peter, in Tempio, to a cathedral, uniting Tempio and Ampurias, so that one bishop should govern both. The see was vacant from 1854 to 1871. Antonio Maria Contini was appointed bishop of Ogliastra, 26 September 1882, and transferred to this diocese, 16 January 1893.
