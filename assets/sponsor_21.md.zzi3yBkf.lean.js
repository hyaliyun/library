Yr is a Swedish adjective sharing the same root as the English whirl. Yrast is the superlative of yr and can be translated whirlingest, although it literally means \\"dizziest\\" or \\"most bewildered\\". The yrast levels are vital to understanding reactions, such as off-center heavy ion collisions, that result in high-spin states. Yrare is the comparative of yr and is used to refer to the second-least energetic state of a given angular momentum. Background An unstable nucleus may decay in several different ways: it can eject a neutron, proton, alpha particle, or other fragment; it can emit a gamma ray; it can undergo beta decay. Because of the relative strengths of the fundamental interactions associated with those processes (the strong interaction, electromagnetism, and the weak interaction respectively), they usually occur with frequencies in that order. Theoretically, a nucleus has a very small probability of emitting a gamma ray even if it could eject a neutron, and beta decay rarely occurs unless both of the other two pathways are highly unlikely. In some instances, however, predictions based on this model underestimate the total amount of energy released in the form of gamma rays; that is, nuclei appear to have more than enough energy to eject neutrons, but decay by gamma emission instead. This discrepancy is found by the energy of a nuclear angular momentum, and documentation and calculation of yrast levels for a given system may be used for analyzing such a situation. The energy stored in the angular momentum of an atomic nucleus can also be responsible for the emission of larger-than-expected particles, such as alpha particles over single nucleons, because they can carry away angular momentum more effectively. This is not the only reason alpha particles are preferentially emitted, though; another reason is simply that alpha particles (He-4 nuclei) are energetically very stable in and of themselves. Yrast isomers Sometimes there is a large gap between two yrast states. For example, the nucleus 95Pd has a 21/2 state that lies below the lowest 19/2, 17/2, and 15/2 states. This state does not have enough energy to undergo strong particle decay, and because of the large spin difference, gamma decay from the 21/2 state to the 13/2 state below is very unlikely. The more likely decay option is beta decay, which forms an isomer with an unusually long half- life of 14 seconds. An exceptional example is the J=9 state of tantalum-180, which is a very low-lying yrast state only 77 keV above the ground state. The ground state has J=1, which is too large a gap for gamma decay to occur. Alpha and beta decay are also suppressed, so strongly that the resulting isomer, tantalum-180m, is effectively stable for all practical purposes, and has never been observed to decay. Tantalum-180m is the only currently known yrast isomer to be observationally stable. Some superheavy isotopes (such as copernicium-285) have longer-lived isomers with half-lives on the order of minutes. These may be yrasts, but the exact angular momentum and energy is often hard to determine for these nuclides.

Route description View north along State Route 278 at the southern end, near Eureka, September 2014 State Route 278 begins at a junction with US 50, about north-northwest of Eureka in southern Eureka County. The highway heads north- northwest from there, passing by the Eureka Airport and going through Diamond Valley. After about , SR 278 curves westward to run between the Whistler and Sulphur Springs Ranges, turning north and cresting Garden Pass to enter Garden Valley. SR 278 continues heading northward, eventually entering Pine Valley. After several miles, the highway shifts slightly more eastward as it approaches the Cortez Mountains and the Pinon Range. The route follows a creek northwestward, then curves to follow the path of the Humboldt River and Union Pacific Railroad northeastward. The route enters Elko County and soon after enters the city of Carlin. State Route 278 ends on the western edge of Carlin at West Carlin interchange on I-80 (exit 279). History A route approximating the alignment of Eureka‚ÄìCarlin Road appeared on state highway maps as a narrow, unimproved roadway as early as 1927. By 1929, this road had been designated as State Route 20, and was shown to parallel the Eureka and Palisade Railroad connecting Eureka to State Route 1/US 40 (today's I-80) further west of Carlin via Palisade. SR 20 was mostly upgraded to a gravel road by 1946. Except for the portion between Palisade and US 40, the road was completely paved by 1956‚Äîa road connecting just south of Palisade directly to Carlin (approximating today's alignment of the northernmost reaches of SR 278) was also paved by this time. The Eureka‚ÄìCarlin road portion of SR 20 was renumbered as part of State Route 51 by 1965. The Eureka‚ÄìCarlin road remained unchanged for several years after being renumbered to SR 51. However, the Nevada Department of Transportation began renumbering its state highways in the mid 1970s. On July 1, 1976, the road was renumbered again, to State Route 278, the designation it carries today. The number change was first seen on official state highway maps in 1978.

The name Sandav√°gur means sandy bay and refers to the sandy beach which used to be much larger than present. From one point in Sandav√°gur you can get a view of all the southern islands in the Faroes. Sandav√°gur used to be a municipality until 1 January 2009, when it fused together with the neighbour village Mi√∞v√°gur into the new V√°gar municipality. Data: History The town has an ancient history. A 13th century runestone, discovered in 1917, bears an inscription stating that the Norwegian Viking Torkil Onundarson from Rogaland was the first settler in this area. The stone can be seen in Sandav√°gur Church. Excavations in the town have also uncovered ruins from the Middle Ages. √Å Steig in Sandav√°gur was the residence of the Lagman, the lawspeaker and leader of the Faroese parliament, until 1816, when the office was abolished and the islands became a Danish administrative district. The clergyman V. U. Hammershaimb, who was born in Sandav√°gur in 1819 and became the father of the Faroese written language, was the son of the last law speaker. There is a freestanding rock to the east of the town called Tr√∏llkonufingur, which means Witch‚Äôs finger. It is said to have been climbed only once, and the story goes like this: :\\"Frederick VII of Denmark visited the Faroe Islands in 1844, and a man climbed the Witch‚Äôs finger so that he could wave to the King as he sailed past. Later, when the man had come down, he realized that he had left one of his gloves on the top of the rock, so decided to climb it again. On his way to the top he fell and died.\\" Buildings The distinctive red-roofed Church was built in 1917. A memorial was erected outside the church to one of the many ships that were sunk during the Second World War. Vestanstevna festival Sandavagur takes turns in hosting a civic festival called Vestanstevna which takes place annually at the beginning of July. The other participating villages are, Mi√∞v√°gur and S√∏rv√°gur. The festival is similar to Olavs√∏ka in T√≥rshavn but smaller. Economy Kovin, the canning factory in Sandav√°gur produces canned fish products: primarily shrimp, but also roe and normal fish meat. It also produces various kinds of p√¢t√©, for example from salmon, shrimps and tuna.

Broomhall (Chinese: Êµ∑ÊÅ©Ê≥¢; 17 July 1866 ‚Äì 24 October 1937), was a British Protestant Christian missionary to China with the China Inland Mission. He also authored many books on the subject of Chinese missionary work. He was the most famous son (the fifth of ten children) of the anti-opium trade activist and General Secretary of the CIM Benjamin Broomhall and Amelia Hudson Taylor. Thus he was also the nephew of the founder of the mission, James Hudson Taylor. Youth in London In 1875, the Broomhall family, including 9 year old Marshall, moved from Bayswater to Newington Green, London. At Westbourne Grove, where he was born, the family had been members of the Baptist Westbourne Grove Church led by William Garrett Lewis. Marshall's father, Benjamin, then began 20 years of service as the China Inland Mission's general secretary at the London headquarters. In 1887 Marshall went to classical studies at Jesus College, Cambridge. After his graduation (BA) in 1890, he became engaged to Florence Corderoy, the daughter of his father's close friend, John Corderoy. In the same year Marshall was accepted as a missionary by the CIM London Council. Missionary life Marshall Broomhall sailed for China on 2 October 1890 on the S.S. Shannon. He attended a year at the CIM's Chinese Language School at Anqing, Anhui, and then he was appointed to the work in Taiyuan, Shanxi. Three of his siblings (Hudson, Marshall and Edith) had all contracted typhus there, but all three recovered. Marriage and family Florence Corderoy followed him to China in 1894, but mission regulations required that they could not marry until both had served for two years on the field. Marshall and Florence were finally married on 17 March 1897. They had two children: Honor Irene and Dorothea Broomhall. Marshall had been transferred to Hongdong, Shanxi in 1896, to work with Dixon Edward Hoste, his brother-in-law, and with Gilbert Ritchie, who later married his sister, Edith. The famous Pastor Hsi (Xi Shengmo) had recently died. The area that Marshall worked in was 40 miles north and south, and 70 miles wide. In 1897 there was a church membership of 490 in 17 villages, with 14 opium refuges. The churches were largely self-supporting, led by an ordained native pastor, three elders, and 17 deacons. Broomhall worked here for three years. Further work and the Boxer Crisis Florence's poor health necessitated their leaving for Britain in 1899. In 1900, the Boxer Rebellion broke out in China. The China Inland Mission had the greatest loss of all of the mission agencies; seventy-nine people were massacred, including children. As the tragedy unfolded and news was cabled to London, Marshall spent days and nights diligently sorting out information gathered from various sources and verifying rumours that were quickly circulating. His hard work led to the compilation of two memorial books that documented the harrowing stories of both the martyrs and the survivors. Writing and teaching career Chinese Muslim near Zhengzhou, Henan, ca. 1908. Photo from Broomhall's Islam in China That same year Marshall Broomhall had been appointed the Editorial Secretary for the mission in London. This career lasted for 27 years. He also gave preliminary Chinese language lessons to the missionary candidates preparing to go to China. Marshall became an expert in writing biographies. He wrote biographies of Hudson Taylor as well as several other members of the China Inland Mission, as well as several books that addressed overall issues and the history of the CIM. He accomplished much considering his eyesight was impaired at an early age. He did all of his research, writing and editorial work despite being able to see with only one eye. Marshall took part in the Edinburgh Missionary Conference of 1910. After the 1911/12 founding of the Republic of China he visited China again, and travelled extensively to obtain first-hand and up to date information. He was a member of the commission on \\"Carrying the Gospel to all the Non-Christian World\\". In this commission constant reference was made to his important work , and to the statistics in it. One of Broomhall's particular interests was the conversion of Chinese Muslims to Christianity. To this end, he authored a book (), which he believed to be the first book in English on Chinese Muslims. He called for sending Arabic-speaking missionaries to China, who in his views could work more effectively among the Muslim community. In 1927 he retired as Editorial Secretary. But he continued to do his literary work. In 1936, when the Rev. Frank Houghton returned to China to be Bishop of East China, Marshall took over briefly the editorship of China's Millions, but ill health forced his complete withdrawal from the work. He died on 24 October 1937, aged 71, at Northchurch, England and was buried on 28 October in Abney Park Cemetery, London. Florence Broomhall lived on until 1957.

J. Broomhall, was a British Protestant Christian medical missionary to China, and author and historian of the China Inland Mission (renamed as Overseas Missionary Fellowship in 1964, known today as OMF International based in Singapore).  Chinese roots  ‚ÄúJim‚Äù Broomhall was born in Chefoo (Yantai), Shandong, China, in 1911, the son of Benjamin Charles Broomhall and his wife Marion, missionaries to China with the Baptist Missionary Society. The Broomhalls were a missionary family, and Jim was the third generation to be involved in such work. His grandfather, Benjamin Broomhall, had been the general secretary of the China Inland Mission for 20 years and had married Amelia, sister of the founder of the agency, James Hudson Taylor. His uncle, Marshall Broomhall was the most famous of Benjamin's sons as a missionary and historian ‚Äì a professional pattern repeated in Jim's life.  Commitment to service  Jim was educated in the city of his birth at the China Inland Mission Boy's Preparatory School (Chefoo School) at Yantai, and later at Monkton Combe School, Bath, England. When Jim Broomhall was nineteen, he read a book about the Yi people (also called Nosu), an isolated people of the Liangshan mountains in China's Sichuan province. Intrigued, he made up his mind to tell them about Jesus. In preparation, like his great-uncle Hudson Taylor before him, he became a medical doctor receiving his training at the Royal London Hospital. After completing his courses, he joined the China Inland Mission (C.I.M.) and sailed for China in 1938.  Return to China  Before he arrived, China was at war with Japan. The Japanese were already in control of much of China and travel in the country was difficult. Undaunted, he and some fellow missionaries went to Hongkong where they bought station wagons which they then drove through French Indochina and back over the Chinese border to Chongqing, Sichuan. Jim decided to stay in China to face the difficult times alongside the Chinese people. During this wartime, Jim practiced medicine in Sichuan at the mission hospital. Jim married Theodora Janet Churchill (born 13 June 1913; died November 2000) in 1942 in China. They had four daughters. The couple began pioneering work among the Nosu tribe in 1943, they traveled among them giving medical aid and making friends. But a Japanese advance forced them to leave, still not having reached Jim's target‚Äîthe Liangshan mountains. The family had to flee to India for safety. Although thwarted, Jim told everyone  Return to the Nosu  After the war, Broomhalls returned to China in 1946 and Broomhall went to Nosuland, leaving his wife and two daughters at Luoshan, southwest China, for a while. In the end the Broomhalls spent four more years among the Nosu and established a clinic before the arrival of the Communists. In 1947 Jim finally arrived at the place he had dedicated his life to serve, a region in southwestern Sichuan where he could minister again to the Yi people. He had traveled the thousand miles from Lanzhou to Liangshan. Supported by British missionaries, Ruth Dix and Joan Wales, he opened a clinic to help the sick and to spread the Gospel at the same time. He was greatly loved by the local people. In order to dispel the misunderstanding and fear the public had for people with leprosy, he invited a leper to live in his house for a year. The Yi were appalled when Jim took in a leper. The two shared a room and ate the same food. The villagers were so outraged that the leper would endanger Jim this way that they wanted to kill him, but his condition improved, although the irreversible damage could not be undone. Jim often traveled far and wide by donkey to treat patients in remote mountain areas for free. Jim rode a mule along the river banks, treating patients and inviting them to a clinic that he had established. On one occasion he removed a young man's festering arm (it had been damaged in a dynamite explosion) and replaced it with an artificial limb, much to the joy of the boy's family. One summer he rode his mule up into remote mountain villages, tending the sick. Without even the aid of an x-ray machine, Jim performed two operations on a girl with a crippling bone disease and gave her a new life. As a medical doctor, Broomhall performed these operation hundreds of times, and became much respected among the local Yi people. In 1951 the Broomhalls spent several months under house arrest, at the end of which they were expelled from China by the Communists with their four daughters. Many local Yi came to bid farewell to the missionary family.  New focus  Broomhall's investigations as to whether the CIM could undertake medical work in Thailand led to three hospitals being founded there; also a pioneering missionary among the Mangyan people of the island of Mindoro in the Philippines for 11 years from 1953 until he retired.  Writing career  When he retired as a doctor, putting down his surgical knives, he started picking up his pen to record history. He spent over a decade going through the vast range of records regarding Hudson Taylor and the China Inland Mission. Consequently, he wrote the most comprehensive and reliable biography of Hudson Taylor. Broomhall subsequently held a number of positions in the OMF's national office at Newington Green, London.  Last visit to China  In 1988, although in ill health, he obtained permission to visit the Yi again. He returned to the region in Sichuan where he had first ministered to the Yi people. He left in tears, declaring he wanted to return again in two years. By then he was deaf and paralyzed along one side of his body, but people ran to tell each other that Dr. Broomhall was back. A woman knelt before him with a ring, given to her by her mother. During a subsequent return in 1991, he donated US$20,000 worth of medical equipment to the local hospital. Knowing he could never return again, the teary-eyed doctor picked up a clod of earth to take home with him. Three years later Jim died on 11 May 1994. He was 82. His work lives on in the Christian lives he left behind and in the several books he wrote about the Yi.

The baroque palace is built on the site of a fortress from the 1550s, located on an island in the Kolb√§cks√•n river at the west end of Lake M√§laren. The palace has interiors from the 18th century and an important collection of Swedish paintings.  History  King Charles XI of Sweden, by David Kl√∂cker Ehrenstrahl King Gustav Vasa had a fortress built at Str√∂msholm in the 1550s. From 1560 until 1621, it served as the residence of queen dowager Catherine Stenbock, and after this, it was given to a later queen dowager, Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg who, however, preferred to reside at Gripsholm Castle. Finally, in 1654, it was given by King Charles X to Queen Hedvig Eleonora. The old palace of the 1550s later provided the foundation for the present Str√∂msholm Palace, built in 1669‚Äì1674 for Queen Hedvig Eleonora to a design by Nicodemus Tessin the Elder. The palace consists of a central building framed by four square corner towers. On the park side, there is a large, domed central tower. Around 20 estate buildings were erected at the same time as the palace, and the first stages of a park in the French Baroque style were laid out. Work on the interiors came to a halt when the building's fabric was completed. Not until the 1730s was the first phase of interior work carried out, including a palace chapel in the attic designed by the Swedish architect Carl H√•rleman. The interiors at Str√∂msholm Palace are largely Gustavian in style. In 1766 the heir to the Swedish throne, later King Gustav III, married Princess Sophia Magdalena of Denmark. As a wedding present from the Riksdag of the Estates, she was given Str√∂msholm Palace. Extensive interior works commenced, under the architectural direction of Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz, and continued into the 19th century. The queen's bedchamber is a prime example of Swedish interior design from the start of the Gustavian era, as well as the Chinese dining room with its fabric-covered walls with Chinese style paintings done by the renowned tapestry painter Lars Bolander. The palace also houses an important collection of Swedish paintings from the 17th century, amongst others David Kl√∂cker Ehrenstrahl's paintings of King Charles XII's horses. Since the 16th century, Str√∂msholm has been an equestrian center of Sweden. In the 1550s, King Gustav Vasa reinforced the importance of horses here, by raising horses for the cavalry. The Str√∂msholm Riding School was a part of the Swedish Army from 1868 to 1968. Today, Str√∂msholm is used as a hippodrome, where equestrian competitions are held each year. Panorama of Str√∂msholm Palace In 1985, the palace underwent major renovation of its facade. Over the years, the exterior had undergone various alterations, but the plasterwork as originally applied in the 1670s was largely intact. The roof was covered with tar shingles until the 19th century, when these were replaced with tin. The palace was restored in stages during the 1990s. The disposition of the rooms in the royal apartments was restored, and the 18th- century furnishings were placed in the correct context. One of the most important features of the restoration was the reproduction of the 1760s wallpaper, the original of which was found in isolation on an attic beam in one of the houses on the estate. Old linen towels were transformed into royal wallpaper.

Erika was the eighth tropical cyclone, fifth tropical storm, and third hurricane of the season. At first, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) operationally did not designate it as a hurricane because initial data suggested winds of 70 mph (115 km/h) at Erika's peak intensity. It was not until later data was analyzed that the NHC revised it to Category 1 intensity in the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm developed from a non-tropical area of low pressure that was tracked for five days before developing in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on August 14. Under the influence of a high pressure system, Erika moved quickly westward and strengthened under favorable conditions. It made landfall as a hurricane on northeastern Mexico on August 16 and rapidly dissipated inland. While Erika's precursor disturbance was moving across Florida, it dropped heavy rainfall. In south Texas, Erika produced moderate winds of 50 to 60 mph (80 to 95 km/h) along with light rain, causing minor and isolated wind damage in the state. In northeastern Mexico, Erika produced moderate amounts of rainfall, resulting in mudslides and flooding. There, two people were killed when their vehicle was swept away by floodwaters. Meteorological history A weak surface area of low pressure detached from a frontal system on August 8 while 1,150 miles (1,850 km) to the east of Bermuda. It moved southwestward, and on August 9, it generated convection as it passed beneath a cold-core upper-level low. The surface low and the upper-level low turned westward as it revolved around a common center, and by August 11, the surface low developed into a trough while 440 miles (700 km) south of Bermuda. As the system rapidly continued westward, much of the convection remained near the center of the upper-level low, preventing development of a closed surface circulation. On August 13, while located near the northwestern Bahamas, a substantial increase in convection resulted in the upper-level low building downwards to the middle levels of the troposphere, coinciding with the development of an upper level anticyclone. A closed low- level circulation nearly developed on August 14 to the east of Key Largo, Florida, but it weakened due to the deep convection remaining to the north over the mid-level center. The mid-level storm continued westward and moved across Florida. After crossing Florida, Hurricane Hunters indicated a poorly defined circulation, but with winds exceeding tropical storm strength, and the system was designated as Tropical Storm Erika late on August 14 while located 85 miles (135 km) west of Fort Myers. NEXRAD image of Erika making landfall on northeastern Mexico. With well-established outflow and low levels of wind shear, Erika strengthened as the circulation became better defined. A high pressure system persisted over the south-central United States, forcing the storm to move just south of due west at 25 mph (40 km/h). On August 15, convection organized into bands, and as its winds approached hurricane strength, an eye developed within the storm. Erika turned to the west- southwest on August 16, and attained hurricane status just prior to making landfall near Boca San Rafael, Tamaulipas in northeastern Mexico, or about 40 miles (70 km) south of the United States‚ÄìMexico border. The storm rapidly weakened over the mountainous Sierra Madre Oriental, and Erika dissipated early on August 17. The mid-level circulation maintained integrity as it crossed Mexico, and led to the formation of a tropical disturbance after entering the Gulf of California on August 18. It turned to the northwest and weakened on August 20. Operationally, Erika was never upgraded to hurricane status. However, based on a persistent eye feature on radar and Doppler weather radar-estimated surface winds of 75 mph (120 km/h), the National Hurricane Center posthumously upgraded Erika to a hurricane. Preparations Tropical Storm Erika approaching Mexico on August 15 The threat of Erika's onslaught prompted the evacuation of 51 oil platforms and 3 oil rigs in the western Gulf of Mexico. The lack of production led to a loss of production of of oil per day and of natural gas per day. On the day of its landfall, the lack of production led to 1,979 less barrels of oil for the day, or about 0.12% of the total daily production for the Gulf of Mexico, while the loss of of gas for the day was equivalent to 0.23% of the total production. However, due to its rapid motion, the passage of the storm resulted in minimal effects on operations. While the storm was located in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on August 15, the National Hurricane Center issued a Hurricane Watch and Tropical Storm Warning from Brownsville to Baffin Bay, Texas. The center also recommended a Hurricane Watch spanning from Soto la Marina, Tamaulipas to the international border. Late that same day, when strengthening was underway, a Hurricane Warning was either issued or recommended from La Pesca, Mexico to Baffin Bay, Texas, though the warnings for south Texas were dropped when a more southward motion occurred. Just one month after Hurricane Claudette caused millions in damage in south Texas, the fast movement of Erika caught citizens by surprise as it was forecast to make landfall near Brownsville. Citizens and business owners boarded up for the storm. About 10,000 were evacuated from northeastern Mexico due to the threat for flooding, including 2,000 in Matamoros. Impact Rainfall data for Erika The precursor disturbance was expected to bring heavy, yet needed rainfall to the Bahamas. The precursor disturbance dropped heavy precipitation while moving across Florida, including in Indian River County, and also produced 6‚Äì8 ft (1.8‚Äì2.4 m) waves with moderate wind gusts. Erika produced light rainfall across southern Texas, peaking at 3.83 inches (97 mm) in Sabinal, though most locations reported less than two inches (50 mm) of precipitation. In addition, weather radar estimated isolated accumulations of 4 to 6 inches (100 to 150 mm) of precipitation in Kenedy and Brooks Counties. Sustained winds from Erika in south Texas peaked at 39 mph (62 km/h) in Brownsville, where a gust of 47 mph (75 km/h) was also recorded. Strong waves were reported northwards to Corpus Christi. The storm caused minor flooding and beach erosion along South Padre Island. Strong wind gusts of up to 60 mph (95 km/h) caused isolated, minor wind damage in south Texas, including in South Padre Island, where the winds damaged the roof of a business. The winds also uprooted a large tree and caused limb damage to several small- to medium-sized trees in Brownsville. In Texas, damage totaled to $10,000 (2003 USD, $ USD). In Mexico, Hurricane Erika primarily affected the states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Le√≥n, but also had effects on Coahuila as well. Rainfall peaked at 6.71 inches (170.5 mm) in Magueyes in Tamaulipas. Several other locations reported over 3 inches (76 mm), including 4.02 inches (102 mm) in Cerro Prieto, which was the maximum amount in the state of Nuevo Le√≥n, and 3.42 inches (86.8 mm) in Monterrey, where 30 people were injured. Sustained winds peaked at 40 mph (65 km/h) in San Fernando, where a gust of 65 mph (105 km/h) was also reported. The heavy rainfall resulted in severe flooding and mudslides, blocking several highways in northeastern Mexico. In Matamoros, the storm damaged roofs and cars. Moderate winds snapped tree branches and spread debris across roads, though locals considered the storm minor. In the Nuevo Le√≥n city of Montemorelos, two people died when they were swept away after they drove their truck across a partially flooded bridge. Throughout Mexico, 20,000 people were left without power due to the storm. The remnant circulation produced heavy amounts of precipitation in western Mexico and Baja California.

After a long and troubled development cycle that lasted almost two years, the game was cancelled on June 2, 2004. Available development and promotional information depict a massive fantasy setting in which up to 3,000 users‚Äîeach with their own fully customizable character‚Äîcan set out on adventures with one another, fighting monsters and collecting various items. Cancellation Despite being \\"fully playable\\" and near completion according to Microsoft around the time of its cancellation, the title's development was littered with complications from the beginning. One such problem was Level-5's inexperience with online network coding and their inability to properly implement voice chat compatibility into the game, a feature never before implemented on such a large scale in an MMORPG. However, Microsoft was very adamant on its inclusion, as it was a key feature to their Xbox Live service. Relations between the two companies began to spiral out of control as Level-5 struggled to meet the demands required by Microsoft, who in turn grew frustrated at the lack of progress being made on the game. After a short showing at the Tokyo Game Show in 2003, True Fantasy Live Online was delayed from its initial Fall 2003 release into 2004. From then, little was seen or heard about the title, and after being absent from E3s 2004 convention, it was officially cancelled by Microsoft on June 3. In the months following, Level-5 President and CEO Akihiro Hino stated in an interview that the poor relationship between his company and Microsoft, partially due to the latter's inexperience in dealing with Japanese developers, was one of the major reasons behind the game's cancellation. He implied that the two companies did not part amicably. In a 2008 interview with Edge magazine, Shane Kim, former general manager of Microsoft Game Studios spoke in regard to failed Microsoft MMORPG projects, including True Fantasy Live Online. While acknowledging that the cancellations were the right thing to do at the time, Kim also felt that such games could have been successful on the Xbox 360 platform.

He was the stepson of Georges Cuvier.  Journeys in South and Southeast Asia  Drawing of Ganges river dolphin by Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins, 1832 In December 1817, Duvaucel left France for British India and arrived in Calcutta in May 1818, where he met Pierre-M√©dard Diard. Together, they moved to Chandernagore, then a trading post of the French East India Company, and started collecting animals and plants for the Paris Museum of Natural History. They employed hunters who supplied them daily with live and dead specimens, which they described, drew and classified. They also received objects from local rajahs and went hunting themselves. In the garden of their compound, they cultivated local plants and kept water birds in a basin. In June 1818, they sent their first consignment to Paris, containing a skeleton of a Ganges river dolphin, a head of a \\"Tibetan ox\\", various species of little-known birds, some mineral samples and a drawing of a tapir from Sumatra that they had studied in Hastings' menagerie. Later consignments included a live Cashmere goat, crested pheasants and various birds. In December 1818, Thomas Stamford Raffles invited them to accompany him on his journeys and pursue their collections in places where he would have to go officially. He offered to establish a menagerie in his Bencoulen residence. By end of December, they left with him on the basis they would equally share the collected animals. In Pulo-Pinang, they collected two new fish species and some birds. In Achem, they collected only a few plants, insects, birds, snakes, fish and two deer. In Malacca, they bought a bear, an argus and some other birds. In Singapore, they obtained a dugong, of which they prepared drawings and a description that Raffles sent to the Royal Society. These were published in 1820 by Everard Home and planned for publication in the Histoire naturelle des mammif√®res by √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and Fr√©d√©ric Cuvier. After their arrival at Bencoulen in August 1819, Raffles requisitioned most of their collection and left them copies of their drawings, descriptions and notes. Duvaucel and Diard took leave, sent their share to Calcutta and parted. Drawing of a skeleton of a Malayan tapir by Richard Lydekker, 1890s Duvaucel set off to Padang, and collected specimens of the Malayan tapir, Sumatran rhinoceros, several monkeys, reptiles, deer and axis in this area. He returned to Calcutta with several cases of stuffed animals, skeletons, skins and some live monkeys. He returned to Chandernagore, from where he made several excursions. In July 1821, he embarked on the Hooghly River, visited the cities of Hooghly and Guptipara, and moved on across the Ganges to Dacca. From there he traveled to Sylhet and, with permission of a Khasi king, explored the mountains of Cossy and Gentya north of Sylhet. He returned to Calcutta in December with a rich zoological collection, but since then he suffered from the jungle fever. He intended to set off to Tibet in September 1822. But due to political circumstances, he had to restrict his excursions to the territories of Benares in Bengal, and Kathmandu in \\"Nepaul\\". There is no record however that he ever traveled to Nepal, and the editor of the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal noted in 1836 that two of Duvaucel's collectors lived for a year with Brian Houghton Hodgson at Kathmandu. Duvaucel died in August 1824 in Madras, but his obituary was not published until April 1825. Ten years later, rumours were afloat in France that he was mauled by a tiger within minutes.  Publications  Tupaia glis In February 1820, the Asiatick Society (Calcutta, India) published an article jointly written by Duvaucel and Diard entitled \\"Sur une nouvelle esp√®ce de Sorex ‚Äî Sorex Glis\\" including a drawing of a common treeshrew.Diard, P.M., Duvaucel, A.

Bengal Military Orphans Press, 1825  Legacy  The Paris Museum of Natural History received nearly 2000 animals collected jointly by Duvaucel and Diard during their stay of more than a year in the Greater Sunda Islands. Their consignments comprised 88 mammal species, 630 bird species, 59 reptile species and contained stuffed animals, skins, skeletons, drawings and descriptions of such notable species as the Malayan tapir, Sumatran rhinoceros, Javan rhinoceros, gibbons, leaf monkeys, two previously unknown fruit bat species, tree shrews, skunks, binturong and sun bear. Several of these species were first described by French zoologists working at the museum. Anselme Ga√´tan Desmarest described the Malayan tapir in 1819; the Sunda stink badger and Paradoxurus hermaphroditus bondar, a subspecies of the Asian palm civet in 1820; the Sunda pangolin, the Malayan weasel and the genus of Semnopithecus in 1822. In 1821, Raffles published descriptions of the species jointly collected by Duvaucel and Diard in Sumatra, including first descriptions of the sun bear, the binturong, the crab-eating macaque, the Sumatran surili, the siamang gibbon, the silvery lutung, the large bamboo rat, the large treeshrew and the cream-coloured giant squirrel. The many drawings, skeletons, skins and other animal parts that Duvaucel sent to the Paris Museum of Natural History included head, skin and paws of a species from the mountains north of India that his stepfather's brother Fr√©d√©ric Cuvier described as Ailurus fulgens in 1825.Cuvier, F.

The organization exists in Marvel's main shared universe, known as Earth-616, as well as other Marvel Earths/Universes. Its structure is somewhat similar to the Mafia (which is itself almost never referred to in Marvel stories), but the Maggia differs in that it frequently hires supervillains and mad scientists to work for them.The supervillain book: the evil side of comics and Hollywood Some of the prominent Maggia members are supervillains themselves, such as Hammerhead, Silvermane, Count Nefaria and his daughter Madame Masque. The Maggia has come into conflict various superheroes, including Spider-Man, Daredevil, the Fantastic Four, and the Avengers. Comic creator Scott Shaw believes that the Maggia were created to avoid offending the real-life Mafia, as comic book distribution at the time \\"was Mafia controlled\\". Since their debut in comics, the Maggia have been adapted into several forms of media, including television series and video games. Publication history The Maggia first appeared in The Avengers #13 (February 1965) and was created by Stan Lee and Don Heck. Fictional organization history The Maggia is an international crime syndicate that is the world's most powerful organization dedicated to conventional crime (as opposed to subversive activities). Originating in southern Europe, the Maggia spread throughout non-Communist Europe and the Americas. Its presence in the United States first came to public attention in the 1890s, and the Maggia's widespread bootlegging of illegal liquor during the Prohibition Era has become legendary. Today the Maggia controls most of the illegal gambling, loan- sharking, and narcotics trade in the United States, as well as many legal gambling casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey and Las Vegas, Nevada. It also has great influence within various labor unions, and controls politicians on every level of government. Especially in recent years, the Maggia has invested many of its illegal gains into legitimate businesses. However, the Maggia enforces a strict code of secrecy among its members, and does not hesitate to punish betrayals and failures with death. The Maggia is not a monolithic organization but is instead a coalition of many virtually independent groups known as \\"families.\\" The leading members of each family are usually connected through familial or marital ties. The Maggia also has affiliations with other criminal groups such as the Morgan organization in New York City's Harlem. With Bruno Karnelli's leadership, the loss of Silvermane, and Hammerhead siding with Mister Negative, the Maggia is thrown into chaos until Mysterio appears and uses robot duplicates of the dead Maggia members.Amazing Spider- Man #618-620. Marvel Comics.Slott Talks ‚ÄúAmazing Spider-Man‚Äù, Comic Book Resources When the Hawkeyes Kate Bishop and Clint Barton attempted to make a difference in the lives of everyday people by fighting organized crime, several New York crime families, including the Maggia, struck back against them.Fraction's \\"Hawkeye\\" Targets the New York Underworld, Comic Book Resources During the \\"Infinity\\" storyline, it was revealed that the Nobili Family are members of the Maggia where some of its members turned out to be descendants of some Inhumans.Thunderbolts Vol. 2 #14. Marvel Comics. Known Maggia families Several \\"families\\" are based in the New York City area. Three of these families have come to pre-eminence: =The Silvermane Family= Its leader is Silvio \\"Silvermane\\" Manfredi,Luciano J. Iorizzo, Salvatore Mondello, The Italian Americans: Immigrant Heritage of America Series, G.K. Hall, 1980, 9780805784169, p.279 one of the last of the legendary gangsters who came to notoriety during the 1920s and 1930s. This group conducts its activities along traditional Maggia lines, and is heavily involved with the narcotics trade. Silvermane uses unusual scientific means only for the personal goal of staving off his own death, and not for the family's activities. Although Silvermane has a son, Joseph, also known as Blackwing, his successor as family head will probably be his longtime rival, top Maggia lawyer Caesar \\"Big C\\" Cicero. Silvermane initially retained control of his organization after being turned into a cyborg, but most recently his failing health, in both human and cyborg bodies, have left him a figurehead leader at best. The following characters have been members of the Maggia's Silvermane family: * Blackie - Rank unknown. First appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #75. * Caesar Cicero - The Silvermane Family's lawyer.AAQ. Architectural Association Quarterly, Volume 2, Diplomatic and Consular Publishing Services, 1970, p.25 First appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #73. * Man Mountain Marko - Silvermane's top lieutenant. First appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #73. * Rapier - A one-time friend and partner of Silvermane named Dominic Tyrone, who sought revenge after being betrayed. Rapier used an electro-stun rapier as his main weapon. First appeared in The Spectacular Spider-Man Annual #2. Killed by Scourge of the Underworld. =The Hammerhead Family= Dominated by middle- aged Maggia traditionalists, this family first became notorious under unusual circumstances. Perhaps in imitation of the Nefaria family, its leader, known as the \\"Top Man\\", outfitted his family hit men with costumes and advanced weaponry. He then gained ownership of the Baxter Building through questionable means, thinking that doing so would somehow give him legal title to the technology of the building's famed occupants, the Fantastic Four. The Fantastic Four defeated and captured the \\"Top Man\\", his claims to owning the Baxter Building were dismissed by the courts, and the \\"Top Man\\" was reportedly assassinated by order of his own family. The family then sought a new leader who would direct operations along thoroughly traditional lines and chose a newcomer known only as Hammerhead, an amnesia victim whose new ruthless persona had been shaped by his love for gangster films. Hammerhead uses methods from the Prohibition era, including gang wars, although he will use advanced technology for personal ends, such as the exoskeleton that magnifies his strength. In light of Hammerhead's recent loyalty shift to Mister Negative, the status of his Maggia family remains undetermined. They very normally ally with Tombstone and The Chameleon The following characters have been members of the Maggia's Hammerhead family: * Top Man - Former leader of the Hammerhead family. First appeared in Fantastic Four #101 (Aug 1970). Assassinated by an unknown member of his Maggia group. * Hammerhead - Second leader of the Hammerhead family.Deadpool MAX #1 Review, IGN First appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #113 (Oct. 1972). * Big Rock - Rank unknown. First appeared in Fantastic Four #101 (Aug. 1970). * Blackwing (Joseph Manfredi) - Rank unknown. First appeared in Daredevil #118 (Feb. 1975). * Eel (Edward Lavell) - One-time employee and representative of the Maggia's Gulf Coast operations. First appeared in Power Man and Iron Fist #92 (April 1983).Eel, Marunvapp.com * Gimlet - The Top Man's lieutenant who aspired to become the next Top Man. First appeared in Fantastic Four #101 (Aug. 1970). =The Nefaria Family= This group bears little resemblance to the rest of the Maggia. The Italian nobleman, Count Luchino Nefaria, a scientific genius, was the world's most powerful Maggia leader until his initial defeat by the Avengers. Afterwards he moved his base of operations to the New York City area, and then imprisoned Washington, D.C. within an impenetrable force-dome and held it for ransom. After his defeat and capture, his daughter Giulietta, also known as Whitney Frost, succeeded him as family head and led an unsuccessful attempt to capture the advanced weaponry of Tony Stark. She was eventually succeeded by a costumed criminal, the Masked Marauder, who demanded complete control of New York City or else he would detonate a nuclear device there. After his capture, the family again apparently came under control of Whitney Frost, by then known as Madame Masque.The Superhero Book: The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Comic-Book Icons and Hollywood Heroes Contrary to standard Maggia practice, the Nefaria family, principally consisting of men under 40, has employed futuristic weaponry and even robots (like the Dreadnoughts),Jeff Rovin, The Encyclopedia of Super-Villains, Facts on File Publications, 1987, 9780816013562 as well as costumed super-powered agents (Unicorn, Whiplash, Gladiator, etc.), and has launched open attacks on society. Its leader is always known as \\"Big M\\". With both Count Nefaria and Madame Masque now pursuing separate agendas, it is not known who, if anyone, currently heads the Nefaria Family. The following characters have been members of the Maggia's Nefaria family: * Count Nefaria - Founder of the Nefaria family. First appeared in Avengers #13 (Feb. 1965) * Cyclone (Andr√© Gerard) - First appeared in Amazing Spider-Man #143 (April 1975). Killed by Scourge of the Underworld. * Eel (Leopold Stryke) - Former agent.Marvel Graphic Novels and Related Publications: An Annotated Guide to Comics, Prose Novels, Children's Books, Articles, Criticism and Reference Works, 1965-2005, p.177 First appeared in Strange Tales #112 (Sept. 1963).

Competitors and allies Various criminals have attempted to unify the American East Coast's independent criminal groups so as to compete with the Maggia's domination of organized crime. Other lesser criminal organizations may in fact cooperate and work for the Maggia, pay street taxes, or manage to operate under the radar of the Maggia. The most successful competitor of the Maggia has been the Kingpin, who, at his peak, was more powerful than all of the Maggia families combined. As noted above, the principal leaders of all three major Maggia families are, to one extent or another, no longer in ideal leadership positions. With the Kingpin presently exiled from the U.S. in the wake of Daredevil story arcs, the potential for a power vacuum is huge, and the stage is set for a gang war between any and all challengers. The Spider-Man villain called Mister Negative plotted to target the Maggia Families, perhaps hoping to take the Kingpin's place. The supervillain Hood has also formed a supervillain crime syndicate which enlists various costumed criminals in an attempt to gain control of the underworld. Other lesser crime bosses include the Slug (a Miami-based drug kingpin) and the Owl. Whether they are connected to the Maggia or manage to operate separately is unknown. Don Fortunato once managed to gain control of much of New York City's underworld in the absence of the Kingpin. Although Fortunato seems to run a traditional Mafioso organized crime group, he is actually connected to the Maggia and the terrorist organization known as HYDRA. The original Mr. Fish was mentioned to have planned to start a Maggia branch in his area. Although the Maggia organization is, for the most part, analogous in the Marvel Universe to the real-life Italian and Italian-American Mafia or La Cosa Nostra, there exist in the Marvel Universe other Italian crime families that resemble more closely the real Mafia or La Cosa Nostra. Some of these families and organizations have been referred to as \\"the Mafia\\" in recent comics, but it is unknown whether or not these families ultimately operate under Marvel's Maggia organization or are a part of a separate, more realistic La Cosa Nostra organization in the Marvel Universe. These more realistic Italian Mafia organizations are often featured in Punisher comics. As most of these organizations operate on a crew-based street level and specialize in traditional organized crime rather than superpowered organized crime, it is possible they are not connected to the more powerful Maggia. Examples of these organizations include: * The Angelone Crime Family - * The Gnucci Crime Family - It was known for the infamous Ma Gnucci. * The Pazzo Crime Family - * The Roman Crime Family - Other versions =House of M= In the House of M reality, the Maggia is a criminal organization that was led by Count Nefaria.

Hammerhead tries to force the other families into submitting to his rule by employing Black Cat to steal hard drives containing their collective wealth, but she betrays him and keeps them for herself. Afterwards, Hammerhead and his goons steal advanced technology from Sable International, which give them an advantage over the other families. He also kidnaps and attempts to kill the other families' Dons on live television in an attempt to gain respect through fear, but Spider-Man foils and defeats him. After Hammerhead escapes from police custody and transforms himself into a cyborg, Spider-Man and Silver Sable defeat him again, and he is presumably arrested, ending the gang war.

Entry for the year 855: Earthquake at Mainz The Annales Fuldenses or Annals of Fulda are East Frankish chronicles that cover independently the period from the last years of Louis the Pious (died 840) to shortly after the end of effective Carolingian rule in East Francia with the accession of the child-king, Louis III, in 900. Throughout this period they are a near contemporary record of the events they describe and a primary source for Carolingian historiography. They are usually read as a counterpart to the narrative found in the West Frankish Annales Bertiniani. Authorship and manuscripts The Annals were composed at the Abbey of Fulda in Hesse. A note in one manuscript has been taken to prove that the entries down to 838 were composed by Einhard (Enhard in the MS), yet it has been convincingly argued that this might only have been a copyist's colophon that has abusively entered the manuscript tradition, a sort of accident far from uncommon in medieval scriptoria. Be that as it may, a second note sets on more solid grounds the attribution of the annals down to 864 to Rudolf of Fulda, whose manuscript, though not conserved, is mentioned in independent sources and has left traces in the tradition. Some scholars believe that the whole work was first put together by an unknown compiler only in the 870s. It has also been suggested that they were continued after 864 by Meinhard, but very little is known of this continuator of Rudolf's work. However, already after 863 the three (Kurze) or two (Hellman) manuscript groups of the Annals break off into different overlapping versions, continuing Rudolf's work down to 882 (or 887) and 896 (or 901). The two alleged principal extensions have been styled the \\"Mainz\\" and \\"Bavarian\\" continuations respectively. The Mainz version shows strong links with the circle of Liutbert, Archbishop of Mainz, and is written from a Franconian perspective and are partisan to Liutbert and the kings he served. The Bavarian continuation was probably written in Regensburg until 896 and thereafter in Niederalteich. A new edition is eagerly awaited. Sources The years 714 to 830 are largely based on the Royal Frankish Annals (741‚Äì829) and the Annals of Lorsch (703‚Äì803, including continuations). After that date the Annals of Fulda are relatively independent. Content The events recorded in the annals include the death of Louis the Pious and the subsequent dividing of the Frankish Empire into three parts at the Treaty of Verdun. After 860, the annals focus mainly on events in eastern Francia and on its king Louis the German and his sons. It also describes in some detail the raids conducted by the Vikings in the Frankish Empire from 845 onwards. Other events recorded in the annals include various 'miraculous' events such as comets, earthquakes and disease. The annals end in 901, a year after the succession of Louis the Child. Importance Along with the Annales Bertiniani (Annals of Saint-Bertin), the West Frankish narratives of the same events, the Annals of Fulda are the principal historical primary source for ninth-century Carolingian studies.

She spent much of her career as a flagship, and took part in operations to deter Russian aggression against Turkey in 1878 and the bombardment of Alexandria in 1882. She was affectionately known by her crew as Old Alex. She was named after Princess Alexandra (later Queen Alexandra) wife of Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII).Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.307 Background At the time of her design the Board of Admiralty were at loggerheads amongst themselves as regards the provision of sails in their contemporary warships; steam engine design had advanced to the point where ships could cross the Atlantic under steam power alone, but centuries of tradition had left an ingrained emotional attachment to sails in a small but influential number of the senior members of the naval hierarchy. This minority succeeded in convincing the Board to design Alexandra as a rigged broadside vessel. Design Right elevation and deck plan as depicted in Harpers Monthly, February 1886 Built at Chatham Dockyard and engined by Messrs Humphreys and Tennant, Alexandra was the last of a long series of progressive steps in the development of vessels of her type. As the militarily most effective of all of the broadside ironclads, it is ironic that she was designed by Nathaniel Barnaby, who was one of the earliest and most effective proponents of the virtues of turret-mounted artillery. Her armament was disposed in a central box battery, with heavy guns deployed both on the main and on the upper deck. Recognising the increasing importance of axial fire, Barnaby arranged the artillery so that, by firing through embrasures, there was the capability of deploying four heavy guns to fire dead ahead, and two astern; all guns could if required fire on the broadside. Alexandra was the last British battleship to carry her main armament wholly below decks; she was one of only two British ships to mount guns of calibre, the other being HMS Temeraire. She was the first British warship to be powered by vertical compound engines, carrying cylindrical high-pressure boilers with a working pressure of , as compared to rectangular boilers working at pressure mounted in earlier ships. Twelve boilers were set back to back on either side of a longitudinal bulkhead; each engine drove an outward rotating screw of some in diameter. A pair of auxiliary engines, each of , were fitted to turn the screws while the ship was proceeding under sail. These engines could, if required, propel the ship at a speed of . At the time of her completion Alexandra was the fastest battleship afloat. It had been intended to call the ship HMS Superb, but the name was changed at her launching, which was undertaken by Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales, who was later Queen Alexandra. She was the first British ironclad to be launched by a member of the Royal Family; the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, the Duke and Duchess of Teck and the Duke of Cambridge were also present. The religious element of the service (the first at a ship launch since the Reformation) was conducted by Archibald Campbell Tait the then Archbishop of Canterbury assisted by Thomas Legh Claughton, the Bishop of Rochester.Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.308 Service history She was commissioned at Chatham on 2 January 1877 as flagship, Mediterranean Fleet, and held this position continuously until 1889. She was the flagship of Admiral Hornby in his passage through the Dardanelles during the Russian war scare of 1878. She ran aground in bad weather at the narrowest part of the strait; she was towed off by HMS Sultan in time to lead the squadron to Constantinople. She was present at the bombardment of Alexandria in 1882; in this action the Admiral's flag was shifted to HMS Invincible, as she was of shallower draught and could sail closer to shore.Goodrich, Caspar F (Lt Cdr), Report of the British Naval and Military Operations In Egypt 1882, Navy Department, Washington, 1885, p.26 During this action on 11 July 1882, under command of Captain C. F. HothamFamous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p306, Gunner Israel Harding flung a live 10-inch enemy shell into a tub of water, an action which led to the award of the Victoria Cross. In 1886, the Duke of Edinburgh hoisted his flag on board, and Prince George of Wales, later King George V, joined as a lieutenant. She paid off in 1889 for modernisation. In 1891, she was flagship of the Admiral Superintendent of Naval Reserves at Portsmouth, and remained so until 1901. Alexandra was featured in the first volume of the Navy and Army Illustrated in early c. April 1896 and was then described as a \\"coastguard ship at Portsmouth\\" with her principal armament being eight 18-tons guns, four 22-ton, six 4-inch and four six-pounder and six three- pounder quick firers.HMS Alexandra - Coastguard Ship at Portsmouth in The Navy and Army Illustrated, Volume 1, Special Issue on the Foreign and Reserve Squadrons, p.164 At this time, she had a complement of 408 officers and men and was commanded by Captain W.H. Pigott. Her last sea-time was as flagship of the \\"B\\" fleet in the manoeuvres of 1900. In 1903 she became a mechanical training ship, and she was sold in 1908.

It is a retelling of the fairytale Beauty and the Beast set in modern-day New York City from the view of the beast. Flinn researched many versions of the Beauty and the Beast story to write her book. Many of these are playfully alluded to in portions of the book, particularly the chat room transcripts in which the character of Kyle talks to other teens who have been transformed into creatures. Plot Kyle Kingsbury is rich, handsome, and popular; he is also selfish, shallow, and cruel. He plays a mean practical joke on an outcast girl in his class. The girl is really a witch named Kendra in disguise. The witch then curses him for his cruelty. He is turned into a beast; however, because he performed a small act of kindness shortly before his transformation when he gave an unwanted rose corsage to a girl working a ticket booth, she gives him two years to break the spell, or remain a beast forever. The only way he can turn back to normal is if he truly loves a girl and gets her to love him in return, proving the love with a kiss. Kendra later offers Kyle further aid by giving him a magic mirror that shows him whomever he wishes to see. He is locked in a mansion-like apartment by his equally shallow, image-obsessed father. His only company is his housekeeper, Magda, and, at his request, a blind tutor named Will. Kyle finds solace in a greenhouse for roses that he tends himself. After a year of being in this state, and trying and failing to find love, Kyle changes his name to Adrian, meaning \\"the dark one\\", to reflect his feelings of being a completely different person from the conceited, materialistic boy he used to be. When a robber stumbles into his garden Adrian offers him a deal; he will not report the robber to the police if the robber brings Adrian his daughter, Linda. She is Adrian's last chance to break the spell before his two years are up. Adrian realizes that Linda is the same girl to whom he gave the rose corsage. He fixes up a room for her, leaving roses and books for her to amuse herself with. When she arrives, she at first wants nothing to do with him as she feels he kidnapped her. As time passes, she slowly warms up to him and he finds himself falling in love with her. The two begin to have tutoring sessions together and during winter they go to a lodge. Shortly before the last year is up, Linda wishes to see her father once more. Adrian lets her see him with the magic mirror and she finds that he has become sick through drug use. Adrian quickly lets her go to him and offers for her to return to the apartment in the spring if she desires, this time as a friend and not a prisoner. On the last day of the second year, Adrian looks for Linda in the mirror and sees her being dragged into a building by a man. He rushes to her rescue and is shot in the process. As he lies dying, he asks Linda for a kiss. She kisses him, breaking the spell and turns him back to normal. He explains everything to Linda and the two go back and live in the apartment together. Adrian had also made a deal with Kendra, because of which, Will regains his sight and Magda is allowed to return to her family. Kendra reveals that she was Magda, punished to remain a servant forever because of her careless spell but she can now return home as well. Characters *Kyle Kingsbury (a.k.a.\\"Adrian\\") is the son of Manhattan's news anchor, Rob Kingsbury. He is tall, blonde, rich, and handsome. He is the most popular guy in school and dates the hottest girls; however, starts the book as a shallow and lonely bully, feeling abandoned by his father and regularly dishing out cruelty to people less well off than himself. When Kyle asks an unappealing new student, Kendra, to the upcoming dance as a practical joke, Kendra, who is revealed to be a beautiful witch, transforms Kyle into an ugly beast with fangs, claws, and fur. Kyle's father is ashamed of his son's appearance and locks him in a large apartment in downtown New York so no one will see him. Kyle's only company is his housekeeper, and, later, a blind tutor named Will and his dog, Pilot. He changes his name from Kyle (which means \\"handsome\\") to Adrian (which means \\"dark one\\") and over the course of the two years becomes a completely different person (becoming much more kind and sensitive). His only happiness comes from the rose garden he plants and maintains in his small backyard, encouraged by Will. Adrian has two years to break the witch's spell by falling in love and being loved sincerely despite physical appearances. *Linda \\"Lindy\\" Owens is the modern version of \\"Beauty\\". She is described as not the most beautiful girl with red hair, green eyes, and crooked teeth. (However, paralleling the original tale, her name means \\"pretty.\\") She often talks about how she 'dug a tunnel' out of her life and applied for Kyle's school, Tuttle, the most expensive private school in the city. Kyle, when he first saw her, called her a total zero. When he gets the mirror, he keeps watching her, and slowly falls in love with her. Lindy comes into Kyle/Adrian's life again when her drug-addicted father offers Lindy to Kyle so that Kyle wouldn't contact the police about his crimes, and at first Lindy resents Kyle for taking her from her father. After a few days she comes out and tutors with Will and Adrian (Kyle's alias). She loves the roses in the greenhouse. She misses her father, but when she goes back, she is sold again for money and drugs. When they both go back to school, she and Kyle are dating, to the confusion and disapproval of the other students. Lindy is described as very smart and tolerant of her father's drug-filled life. *Kendra Hilferty is a Witch who had used her powers too frequently in her youth and, as punishment, is sent by the witch elders to New York City to work as a servant. She disguises herself as a new student at Tuttle to spy on Kyle. She introduces herself as Kendra Hilferty, bearing green hair and dark clothes, and is overweight and ugly. However, before she transforms Kyle, her \\"ugliness\\" disappears and she is described as a beautiful witch. She also is disguised as Magda, the Kingsbury's maid, to serve and, at the same time, spy on Kyle during his two years as a beast. At the end, Kyle finds out everything about the witch, but lets her go as a part of the deal they made earlier, so Kendra returns to her fellow witches. *Will Fratalli is in his late twenties, tall and slender with curly hair. Will is also a kind person who has a love of literature and had Kyle read books such as The Hunchback of Notre Dame and The Phantom of the Opera. He is hired to tutor Kyle after Kyle's transformation. He is blind, and has a dog, Pilot, who serves as a helper and a watchdog. At first, Pilot feels uncomfortable around Kyle but as the time passes, he starts to become fond of him. In the end, Kendra restores Will's eyesight as a part of her deal with Kyle, and he becomes an English teacher at Tuttle while studying to become a professor. *Rob Kingsbury is Manhattan's most popular news anchor. He has a son, Kyle, who he neglects. He is rich and handsome and lives in a large apartment with his son and the maid, Magda. Mr. Kingsbury works 24/7 and barely spends time with his son. When he finds out about Kyle's transformation, he locks him up in a luxurious five-floor apartment because he is embarrassed by him and doesn't want anyone to know that his son is a monster. Rob also had a wife that lives in Miami married to a plastic surgeon, but she left him (Rob) for unknown reasons many years ago (she is not named in the book). Overall, Rob is a shallow and unsympathetic man who cares more for his image than he does for his own son. *Mr. Anderson and the Support Group Members are members of a special online support group for people who have gone through transformations. Mr. (Chris) Anderson is the 1800s fairy tale author, Hans Christian Andersen, who wrote stories like Thumbelina and The Little Match Girl. Froggie is the frog prince. Grizzlyguy is the prince from Snow- White and Rose-Red. Silentmaid is Hans Christian Andersen's Little Mermaid. Kyle/Adrian uses the screen name BeastNYC on it. *Daniel Owens is Linda's sickly and drug addicted father. Linda is sympathetic toward him, despite the fact he was willing to give her up to avoid legal persecution for breaking into Kyle's greenhouse and has hit her more than a few times. It is mentioned that Daniel did try to clean up his act, quit drugs, and get a job, but it only lasted for about a week before he went back to his own ways.

Despite the fact that everyone knows the plot, Flinn's version is well worth reading.\\" Publishers Weekly writes that \\"[T]he happily-ever-after ending is rewarding, if not surprising.\\" Donna Rosenblum of School Library Journal commented positively on Flinn: \\"The story is well written and grips readers right from the beginning with an online chat session with Kyle/Beast and other fairy-tale characters. And, since it's told from the Beast's point of view, it will appeal to boys who otherwise might not pick it up.\\" With Beastly, Flinn received positive remarks from reviews. Sonderbooks praised Flinn, saying, \\"I love the way Alex Flinn worked in all the elements of the traditional tale. I also loved the believable way she showed us Kyle changing, transforming. And of course there's the wonderful blooming of true love. All this adds up to a truly delightful book that I hope will become wildly popular with teens. And any adults who will admit to enjoying Twilight, let me urge you to give Beastly a try.\\" Romantic Times writes that \\"Flinn does another solid job of giving a fresh perspective to what could have been a preachy story. She keeps the drama and intrigue high and constantly challenges the reader in this twist on Beauty and the Beast\\" Film adaptation Vanessa Hudgens and Alex Pettyfer played Lindy and Kyle, respectively, and Mary-Kate Olsen portrayed Kendra.(June 3, 2009) CBS Films bought the feature rights to Beastly.

Although it was the first project picked up by CBS Films it did not end up being their first release (which was the January 2010 release Extraordinary Measures), it was to be originally released on July 30, 2010. However it was postponed until March 4, 2011 due to competitive concerns from other films released on that date and late summer 2010 in general.

It is the first installment in Sony's Formula One series. Formula 1 is based on the 1995 Formula One World Championship. It is distinct from its sequels because it was made at the end of the season, meaning that it features driver substitutes. The game also allows two players to compete against each other either head-to- head or with other computer cars via the PlayStation Link Cable. Both players may then compete over a 17-race Championship season, or in a single race of the player's choice. Gameplay Formula 1 contains 17 tracks, 13 teams and 35 drivers. If a player is to complete a season after winning every race, and leading the Constructor's Championship, a special hidden circuit is unlocked. The track is a fictional lower-level city circuit called Frameout City, which when viewed at the Race Preview page is in the shape of a Formula One car. The only way to keep the track available is to save just after having completed the season, then loading the data at the next turning on of the console. Later tracks have 24 competitors on them instead of 26 because Simtek pulled out of the actual championship after the Monaco Grand Prix. It is still possible to drive a Simtek on any course after Monaco, creating a field of 25 drivers. If two players are playing the game via the link cable setup (where players would connect two PlayStation consoles together with two copies of the game), it is possible to play as both Simtek cars, thus creating a field of 26 drivers on any course after Monaco. Every starting grid (in dry races) is the same as the real 1995 Grand Prix, timing included. Development The track models in Formula 1 were modelled from surveyors' track data. The designers started with wire-frame models of the track data, then exported these from their Silicon Graphics workstations to a custom Windows 95 track editor. The track editor was used to reformat the tracks so that they could be used in-game, before exporting them back to the SGI workstations where scenery and other details were added in. To create the in-car sound, a Digital Audio Tape was strapped to a driver. Car models were created based on a combination of information provided by FOCA and real life photographs of the cars. The result was that all call models were unique rather than just a single model with different coloured \\"skins\\". Though Psygnosis was the game's publisher, development team Bizarre Creations opted to create their own 3D engine for the game rather than utilizing the one from the Psygnosis hits Wipeout and Destruction Derby. To reduce demand on the PlayStation's processor without significantly reducing the game's visuals, the developers programmed the game so that when a car reaches a certain distance away, it switches from its normal high-detail model (composed of 440 to 450 polygons, depending on the car) to a low-detail model composed of only 90 to 100 polygons. The game's original release date was pushed back to allow the developers time to make last-minute tweaks, fix bugs, and make the complex graphical changes needed to remove cigarette and alcohol advertising, which is illegal in video games in some parts of the United States. Probe Software started work on a port of the game for the Sega Saturn in 1997. Psygnosis's Formula One license had expired by this time, presenting a potential obstacle to this conversion being released. It was cancelled by June 1997. Commentary This game saw the introduction of in-game commentary, which was done in the English version of the game by Murray Walker, the German version by Jochen Mass, the French version by Philippe Alliot, the Spanish version by Carlos Riera and the Italian version by Luigi Chiappini. Soundtrack The in-game music was composed by Mike Clarke, who worked in-house at Psygnosis at the time, and Stuart Ellis, a session- guitarist from Liverpool and owner of Curly Music, an independent music retailer. The soundtrack also features the songs \\"Juice\\" by Steve Vai (from Alien Love Secrets), as well as \\"Summer Song\\" and \\"Back to Shalla-Bal\\" by Joe Satriani (from The Extremist and Flying in a Blue Dream, respectively). Reception The game was a best-seller in the UK.Gallup UK PlayStation sales chart, December 1996, published in Official UK PlayStation Magazine issue 13 Worldwide sales across all computer and console versions of Formula 1 surpassed 1.7 million units by August 1997. In August 1998, the game's PlayStation version received a \\"Platinum\\" sales award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD), indicating sales of at least 200,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The PlayStation version was reasonably well-received, with critics generally commenting that the realistic handling and real-world Formula One elements make it an ideal game for the hardcore racing fan. Some reviewers added that the game was too complicated and difficult to appeal to those looking for arcade-style racing or multiplayer gaming, though most praised the selection of modes as opening up the game to both novices and experts. Critics were more divided about the graphics. Todd Mowatt wrote in Electronic Gaming Monthly that \\"the fluidity of the animations were not that realistic in terms of the way a real race car would handle\\", GamePros Air Hendrix praised the detailed cars and sense of speed but complained of break-up problems, and Next Generation hailed the graphics as a major leap over the first wave of PlayStation games. GameSpot called the game \\"a high-octane masterpiece\\", while Next Generation summarised, \\"With its exquisite graphics, wide range of challenges, and startling amount of depth, Formula 1 is the game that changes everything.\\" PSM gave the game 9/10, praising the AI, before concluding \\"Psygnosis' finest game to date, it relegates every other racing game to the back of the grid. This is the game that will sell the PlayStation to Grand Prix fans and unconverted gamers alike. An envelope-pushing killer-application. F1 is one of the essential purchases of 1996\\".F1 review, Official UK PlayStation Magazine, Future Publishing, October 1996, issue 11, page 62 Reviewing the PC version in GameSpot, Tim Soete praised the graphics and audio commentary but found the lack of depth and realism in the driving made the game become dull after a short while. Review aggregation website GameRankings provides an average rating for the PlayStation version of 87.75% based on 4 reviews. The PC version received an average rating of 56.40% based on 10 reviews.

He played college football as a nose guard for the Oklahoma Sooners. He served as the head coach of the Sooners from 1996 to 1998. Coaching career Blake served as the head coach for the Oklahoma Sooners from 1996 to 1998, succeeding the one-year term of Howard Schnellenberger. He compiled a career record of 12‚Äì22, which is the worst three-year stretch at the University of Oklahoma football history. Despite his overall poor performance as college head coach, Blake was an admirable recruiter. He was responsible for bringing in more than half of the 2000 championship team‚Äôs 22 starters, including future N.F.L. players like safety Roy Williams and linebacker Rocky Calmus. Prior to his arrival in Norman, Blake had served as the defensive line coach for the Dallas Cowboys, working alongside former UNC coach Butch Davis (2007‚Äì11) as well as former Sooner and then Cowboys head coach Barry Switzer. The Dallas Cowboys won two Super Bowls (1993 & 1995) during Blake's stint. Blake also worked as a defensive assistant at Oklahoma in the early 1990s under Gary Gibbs. Blake served as the defensive line coach at Mississippi State University in 2003. He later held the same position on Bill Callahan's staff at the University of Nebraska from 2004 to 2006. Blake resigned his position at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Sunday, September 5, 2010. On February 16, 2016 Lamar University announced that they had hired Blake to serve as their defensive line coach.LU hires two new defensive coaches After one month at Lamar and during the Cardinals' spring camp, Blake accepted the defensive line coach position with the Buffalo Bills on March 15, 2016 following the Bills' firing of Karl Dunbar. Controversies Blake was involved in a controversy towards the end of his tenure as defense line coach for the Dallas Cowboys. According to The New York Times, Blake made claims to head coach Barry Switzer that Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman treated his black teammates differently and was a racist. In response to this, many members of the Cowboys organization, including black coaches and players, came to the defense of the quarterback. Michael Irvin, Emmitt Smith, and Charles Haley went on the record to stand by Aikman. Aikman also asked a number of black players, including Deion Sanders and Darren Woodson, if there was a problem, and they said there wasn't one. Blake was dismissed from his position with the Cowboys to begin serving as head coach at Oklahoma. In 2010, Blake resigned from North Carolina in the midst of an investigation into players' relationships with agent Gary Wichard, who died of pancreatic cancer in 2011. At the time, Blake was suspected of being an employee and receiving cash benefits from Wichard. Blake denied all allegations, and said he was secretive about his communications with Wichard because he did not want to reveal his friend's then-secret cancer diagnosis. On March 12, 2012, the NCAA announced that Blake had received a three-year show-cause penalty, which effectively barred him from college coaching during that period. The NCAA determined that Blake had received personal loans from Wichard and failed to disclose them to UNC, and also misled NCAA investigators.  Death  Blake died on the morning of July 23, 2020 at the age of 59. He suffered a heart attack while walking near his home and was transported to Baylor University Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.

In anatomy, a heterodont (from Greek, meaning \\"different teeth\\") is an animal which possesses more than a single tooth morphology. In vertebrates, heterodont pertains to animals where teeth are differentiated into different forms. For example, members of the Synapsida generally possess incisors, canines (\\"eyeteeth\\"), premolars, and molars. The presence of heterodont dentition is evidence of some degree of feeding and or hunting specialization in a species. In contrast, homodont or isodont dentition refers to a set of teeth that possess the same tooth morphology. In invertebrates, the term heterodont refers to a condition where teeth of differing sizes occur in the hinge plate, a part of the Bivalvia.

The route serves the city of Winnemucca and the route's western end runs concurrent with Interstate 80 Business (I‚Äë80 Bus.). Route description View westbound along East Winnemucca Boulevard (SR 289/I‚Äë80 Bus.) in Winnemucca, June 2014 First reassurance sign along southbound SR 289 (East Second Street), June 2014 SR 289 begins at the intersection of Melarkey Street and Winnemucca Boulevard in downtown (commercial district of) Winnemucca. (Melarkey Street is the dividing point between West Winnemucca Boulevard and East Winnemucca Boulevard. Melarkey Street continues northwest as U.S. Route 95 [US 95], but southeast as just a city street. West Winnemucca Boulevard (I‚Äë80 Bus./US 95) continues southwest to an interchange with I‚Äë80.) From its western terminus, SR 289 heads northeast along East Winnemucca Boulevard (I‚Äë80 Bus./US 95) as a four-lane road to cross South Bridge Street and Baud Street before passing briefly passing by the northwest edge of a residential area and the southeast end of the short Barrett Street. After crossing Reinhart Street, commercial district resumes on both sides of SR 289 before it passes the southeast end of the short Hurst Street. The route then turns slightly to a more northerly course as it gains a median strip between its four lanes, just before reaching its next intersection with East 2nd Street. From this T intersection, East Winnemucca Boulevard heads southwest as SR 794/I‚Äë80 Bus., while SR 289 continues northeast along East 2nd Street. Next the route quickly reaches a diamond interchange with Interstate 80 (Exit 178), followed by a T intersection with the south end of See Drive (a dirt road which very briefly heads southeast from SR 289 before turning northwest and then looping back to SR 289). After passing See Drive, SR 289 loses its median strip and narrows to a two-lane road; remaining as such for the rest of its length. Traveling through rural area, the route passes northwest of a mobile home park before leaving the city limits of Winnemucca and immediately reaching a T intersection with the north end of See Drive (which heads southeast from the route and is paved for a short section on its north end). Finally SR 289 reaches its eastern terminus at an intersection with Reinhart Drive (SR 795). From the eastern terminus of SR 289, East 2nd Street continues northeast through Weso to end near the south bank of the Humboldt River. SR 795 heads northwest to cross the Humboldt River and connect with US 95. History The highway was formerly part of Nevada State Route 1 and later U.S. Route 40\\\\. SR 289 became a state highway on July 1, 1976, during the renumbering of Nevada's state highway system.

History L√ºtschental is first mentioned in 1238 as Liscinthal. In 1275 it was mentioned as Lyzental. During the Middle Ages the L√ºtschine valley was part of the Herrschaft of Unspunnen. During the 13th and 14th centuries, Interlaken Abbey acquired land and rights in the village until they eventually owned most of the land and people in the area. In 1349 the residents of the village joined other villages in the Bernese Oberland in an unsuccessful rebellion against the Abbey. In 1528, the city of Bern adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation and began imposing it on the Bernese Oberland. L√ºtschental joined many other villages and the Abbey in an unsuccessful rebellion against the new faith. After Bern imposed its will on the Oberland, they secularized the Abbey and annexed all the Abbey lands. L√ºtschental became a part of the Bernese bailiwick of Interlaken. Beginning in the late 19th century, the population of the village dropped as residents moved to the cities of the Swiss Plateau or emigrated in search of jobs. The construction of a power plant for the Jungfrau railway, in 1908, provided more jobs but was unable to stop the population decline. Today some residents raise livestock in alpine meadows or work in the small tourism industry. About half of the working population commute to jobs in the nearby municipality of Grindelwald.

Optimum contract The optimum contract is the one that offers the best chance of gaining the most scoring points whilst minimising the risk of failure. It is that contract that cannot be improved upon by further bidding nor could it have been improved upon by taking a different line in earlier bidding. At Chicago or IMP scoring it is generally worth bidding game even with a slightly less than 50% chance of success due to the relatively high value of the bonuses (especially when vulnerable). In duplicate pairs scoring, the subtle difference between a major suit game, a NT game and a minor suit game make the declaration an important decision. Each side has its own optimum contract and, for a side with poor hands, \\"pass\\" may be the optimum call. Par contract Where there is competitive bidding (i.e. both sides are bidding) the extra dimension of sacrificial bidding is added, and the theoretical optimum contract can be overtaken by the par contract. The par contract on a deal is that contract that results from optimal bidding by both sides and that neither side could improve by further bidding. It will either be equal to the optimum contract of one side or it will exceed the optimum contract of both sides. If the latter, it is only considered par if the doubled penalty is less than the value of the opposing optimum contract. Par score or par result The par result is that score that arises from the par contract and on which neither side could reasonably improve by changing their line of play. Game theoreticians would refer to such a par result as a Nash equilibrium. The term par score originated in the game of golf.

It is situated near the Nightcliff foreshore, where Darwin was defended from Japanese air raids in World War II. Today the school has a coeducational student population of approximately 500 Primary School students and 70 part-time Preschool students. After leaving Nightcliff Primary School, many students enroll at Nightcliff Middle School. History The Nightcliff Primary School site was initially used as an ammunition storage depot during World War II. This was extensively cleared and Nightcliff Primary School was opened on the 7 February 1961 with 240 students and seven classrooms available for use. The staff included the Principal and seven teachers. By 1962, thirteen classrooms were in use. The first uniform consisted of grey shirt and shorts for the boys and a green checked poplin shift dress with a black and white shield embroidered on the pocket for the girls. Initially a black and white peewee was to be embroidered on the pocket but this proved too difficult and costly. In 1964 enrolment had grown to 1038 and several classes had to walk each day to the uncompleted Rapid Creek Primary School where some classrooms had been made available for use. In 1965 Rapid Creek Primary School opened which solved the accommodation problem at the time. By 1974 with an enrolment of 630, extensions were planned for Nightcliff Primary School but Cyclone Tracy thwarted these plans and on Christmas Eve 1974, Cyclone Tracy damaged the school buildings beyond economical repair. After the devastation of the cyclone, Alawa, Millner, Rapid Creek and Nightcliff Primary Schools combined in the Alawa Primary School buildings in February 1975. Within a few weeks the numbers were too large so students were relocated to Millner Primary School. The resulting combination of schools was named Nimira (Nightcliff, Millner and Rapid Creek) and remained operational for the whole of 1975. By the beginning of 1976 teachers and students moved back into the habitable buildings and eleven demountable classrooms. It wasn't until 1978 that rebuilding the school began and canteen facilities were not provided until the completion of Stage 2 in 1981. In 1990, as a result of Economic Review Committee's findings Rapid Creek Primary School was closed and Rapid Creek became part of the feeder area for Nightcliff Primary School. By 1991 numbers rose to 410 and demountable classrooms were added to cope with the increasing need for additional classes. Major renovations including the addition of an Assembly Area, canteen, toilets, seven classrooms, a dental clinic and an Out of Hours School Care facility began in 1991 and was completed in 1999. In addition, the Library, Staffroom and Office underwent major refurbishment. Throughout 2006, Nightcliff Primary was involved with the NTSCHOOLS Project and received around 60 new computers through this program. A former teacher at the school was charged with assaulting a student during the school's Harmony Day celebrations in 2009. It is believed to be the first recorded instance of such an assault in the state. School Teams Nightcliff Primary School has four school teams all named after famous explorers who each discovered many different parts of Australia. They are Flinders, Stuart, Gregory and Tasman. One day a year during the dry season, the school holds a sports day in which children participate in competitive sporting activities, mainly in track and field events, with the aim of winning award ribbons and points towards their allocated school team.

History Roman coins have been found in Radelfingen and there is a Roman aqueduct in Staatswald-Gurgel. Radelfingen is first mentioned in 894 as Ratolingun in a donation made by Pirins to the Abbey of St. Gall. During the Middle Ages, the nearby Kyburg herrschaft of Oltigen and the Counts of Thierstein owned land in Radelfingen. The right to hold the low court was owned by local nobles until 1502 when Frienisberg Abbey acquired the right and gave it over to Bern. Radelfingen became part of the Bailiwick of Aarberg. The village church was built on the site of Roman era building. The current building was built in 1594 and renovated in the 18th century. Some of the ruins of the former Cistercian Tedlingen Monastery are still visible in the village. In 1851-52 a road was built which linked Radelfingen to Bern and Aarberg. Originally the municipality included villages on both sides of the Aare, but in 1868 the left bank of the river (including Niederruntigen, Buttenried) joined the municipality of M√ºhleberg. In 1906, the first Postauto in Switzerland, began service between Bern and Detligen with a stop in Radelfingen. A power plant was built in 1959-63 between Niederried and Radelfingen. During the early 20th century, the population of the villages declined as increasingly mechanized agriculture required fewer workers. However, by the 1980s, the population stabilized in Radelfingen and agriculture remained important to the local economy. In 2005, about 52% of the jobs in the municipality were in agriculture. The villages that made up the municipality originally had five schools, but by 2009 only the schools in Radelfingen village and Matzwil were still in operation. Geography Radelfingen has an area of . Of this area, or 57.7% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 31.4% is forested. Of the rest of the land, or 6.7% is settled (buildings or roads), or 3.6% is either rivers or lakes and or 0.4% is unproductive land.Swiss Federal Statistical Office-Land Use Statistics 2009 data accessed 25 March 2010 Of the built up area, housing and buildings made up 3.1% and transportation infrastructure made up 2.6%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 39.6% is used for growing crops and 15.9% is pastures, while 2.3% is used for orchards or vine crops. Of the water in the municipality, 1.4% is in lakes and 2.2% is in rivers and streams. The municipality is located on the right bank of the Aare reservoir and on the edge of the Frienisberg Plateau. It consists of the villages of Radelfingen and Detligen along with the hamlets of Landerswil, Ostermanigen, Jucher, Matzwil, Oltigen and Oberruntigen as well as scattered individual farm houses. The municipality lies in the Swiss plateau and is from Bern and from Aarberg. Coat of arms The blazon of the municipal coat of arms is Argent a Wheel Gules.

Some have been authored by non-Indigenous writers, while others have been written or contributed to by Indigenous authors. Children‚Äôs literature about American Indians There are a great many works of children's literature that feature American Indians. Some are considered classics, such as Little House on the Prairie by Laura Ingalls Wilder, and some are award winners, such as The Matchlock Gun by Walter D. Edmonds. These classics, however, contain images of American Indians that are biased, stereotypical, and inaccurate (Reese, 2008). Numerous studies report the predominance of positive and negative stereotypes and the pervasive tendency to present a monolithic image of American Indians that is largely inaccurate. The majority of the books were written and illustrated by authors who are not themselves Native American, and studies of the ways they portray American Indians indicate they mirror popular culture more than history or reality of any Native tribal nation or group (Caldwell-Wood & Mitten, 1991; Dorris, 1982; Flaste, 1982; Hirschfelder, 1993; MacCann, 1993; Reese 2001; Slapin and Seale, 1982). Author and illustrator Paul Goble (and the adopted son of Chief Edgar Red Cloud) has written dozens of children's books that retell ancient stories. His book The Girl Who Loved Wild Horses won the Caldecott Medal in 1979. Lakota scholar Elizabeth Cook-Lynn (Cook-Lynn, 1998) and Lakota librarian Doris Seale find his retellings inaccurate. Displeasure in them led the American Indian Library Association to ask the American Library Association to withdraw \\"Native American Month\\" posters and bookmarks with his art on them in 2007. ALA complied with the request, signaling the respect accorded to scholars and practitioners who work with Native populations. However, the debate over Goble's work is far from one-sided. Many prominent Native American authors still support his contribution to the field of study. Authors‚Äîsuch as Joe Medicine Crow‚ÄúHis [Goble‚Äôs] art is tremendous because he is able to recreate the traditional forms with great accuracy and detail. The designs he draws are completely authentic and his colors are the same ones that were used by the old-timers before the reservation days. He is able to recreate the spirit of the old stories with his illustrations and words. The stories he selects are all important and help explain our Indian traditions. When he retells a story he captures the most important parts. He also has the ability to select some of the best writings of our old-timers.‚Äù (Absaroka), Vivian Arviso Deloria‚ÄúI met Paul Goble and deeply appreciate his dedication to recapture Lakota stories... He is quiet and humble in nature and he never neglects to give tribute to his native sources and references... It is an appreciation deeply felt for a man [Goble] whose work is now the many fine books that are in the hands of young people, both Lakota and non-Lakota. Thank you Paul, for your work all these years to renew our understanding of stories from the Buffalo Days.‚Äú (Navajo), Joseph Bruchac‚ÄúFew non-Indians have immersed themselves as deeply in the histories and traditions of the Native nations of the Great Plains as Paul Goble. Through his distinguished career as an artist and a storyteller, he‚Äôs always paid close attention to the details that often elude those who try to write about or illustrate Native American stories but lack his knowledge and desire for veracity.‚Äù (Abenaki), Lauren Waukau-Villagomez‚ÄúAs a result of his [Goble‚Äôs] study and hard work, his stories and illustrations are culturally correct and significant. His depiction of Native Americans is respectful and fair‚Ä¶. His interpretation of Native history and legends has held up over and over for than a generation of readers.‚Äù (Menominee), Robert Lewis‚ÄúIn reading Paul Goble, I am reminded again of the power of stories‚Ä¶. They remain inside of us like dreams that need to be remembered. Paul Goble has found one of these dreams and with poignant words given a new vision of Red Cloud‚Äôs War‚Ä¶‚Äù (Cherokee/ Navaho/Apache) and Albert White Hat Sr.‚ÄúBut what I admire most is that he [Goble] is the only non-Indian I know who has kept a Lakota flavor in his thought, in his stories. He doesn‚Äôt westernize the words and he has not watered down the stories to cater to non-Indians. More than a decade ago I even translated his book, Buffalo Woman, into Lakota so that our Sioux people can hear his storytelling. He tells his stories as if we were sitting around a tipi campfire in the olden-days.‚Äù (Lakota)‚Äîhave publicly stated their support of Goble bringing traditional Native American stories to the public‚Äôs attention, going so far as praising his attention to detail and his use of primary sources. Children's literature written or illustrated by American Indians Like any people, American Indians have a long history of using the oral tradition to tell stories that pass along their history and culture from one generation to the next. As noted in The Oxford Encyclopedia of Children's Literature, in the entry \\"Native American Children's Literature,\\" as far back as 1881, Native authors published stories for children, many that countered stereotypical portrayals. These stories appeared in magazines and books. *In January 1881, Susette LaFlesche of the Omaha tribe wrote ‚ÄúNedawi‚Äù for a children‚Äôs magazine called St. Nicholas. Her Omaha name was Inshata Theumba, which translated into English, is Bright Eyes. Her story, ‚ÄúNedawi‚Äù is about life in an Omaha hunting camp, told from the perspective of a young girl. *Several stories by Charles Alexander Eastman appeared in St. Nicholas in 1893 and 1894. They were later published in a book called Indian Boyhood (1902, 1933, 1971), which was a favorite in Boy Scout programs. Eastman was a Dakota Indian, and his Dakota name was Ohiyesa. An illustrated children's book of Ohiyesa's childhood, Indian Boyhood: The True Story of a Sioux Upbringing edited by Michael O. Fitzgerald published by Wisdom Tales is schedule for release in 2016. *In 1931, Luther Standing Bear‚Äôs autobiographical My Indian Boyhood (1931) was published. He was Lakota; his Lakota name was Ota K‚Äôte. He wrote two other books that describe traditional Lakota culture: My People the Sioux (1928) and Land of the Spotted Eagle (1939). *I am a Pueblo Indian Girl (1939) was written by 13-year-old Louise Abeita, an Isleta Pueblo girl known to her people as E-Yeh-Shure, which translates to \\"Blue Corn\\". In it, she writes about daily aspects of Pueblo Indian life and culture. The illustrations in the book were watercolors painted by Native artists like Allan Houser whose work would eventually become renowned internationally. American Indian illustrators, too, sought to counter these stereotypical images. During the 1940s, the United States. Bureau of Indian Affairs published a series of bilingual readers known as the ‚ÄúIndian Life Readers,‚Äù for use in the U.S. Government Boarding and Day Schools. Most of the books were written by non- Native author Ann Nolan Clark, but illustrated by Native artists from the tribe the reader was about. For example, Hoke Denetosisie said: \\"The nature of the series, being concerned with Navajo life, called for illustration genuine in every sense of the word. I had to observe and incorporate in pictures those characteristics which serve to distinguish the Navajo from other tribes. Further, the setting . . . had to change to express local changes as the family moved from place to place. The domestic animals . . . had to be shown in a proper setting just as one sees them on the reservation. The sheep could not be shown grazing in a pasture, nor the horses in a stable, because such things are not Navajo.\\"Bader, 1976, p. 162 One of the readers, initially called Third Grade Home Geography, was published by a mainstream press in 1941, retitled In My Mother‚Äôs House. It is about life in Tesuque Pueblo, and it is illustrated by Pueblo artist Velino Herrera. In the 1950s, other Native people wrote books for children. D‚ÄôArcy McNickle‚Äôs historical novel, Runner in the Sun, was published in 1954. It is about a teenager being trained to lead his people. McNickle was Chippewa Cree. Pablita Velarde of Santa Clara Pueblo retold and illustrated stories told to her by her grandfather in Old Father, the Storyteller, published in 1960. She is also a world-renowned artist. During the 1970s, the American Indian Historical Society published a magazine for children titled The Wee Wish Tree. In it were short stories, poems, and essays written by American Indians, many of them children. Also during that time, the Council on Interracial Books for Children was instrumental in publishing the work of Virginia Driving Hawk Sneve, a Rosebud Sioux. She wrote High Elks Treasure in 1972, When Thunders Spoke in 1974, and The Chichi Hoohoo Bogeyman in 1975. Sneve was awarded the National Humanities Medal in 2000. Simon Ortiz‚Äôs prose poem The People Shall Continue was published in 1977. It covers the history of American Indians from creation to the present day, but also includes content omitted or glossed over in other narratives about the settlement of the United States. Ortiz includes the forced removal of Native peoples from their homelands, the brutal periods of early government- controlled boarding schools, and the social movements of the 1960s. Ortiz is from Acoma Pueblo. In the 1980s, the prolific Abenaki author, Joseph Bruchac, began writing his books for children. In 1985, The Wind Eagle and Other Abenaki Stories was published. It was followed by picture books, traditional retellings, historical and contemporary fiction, biography and autobiographical works. His young adult thriller, Skeleton Man, received the Sequoyah Book Award in 2004. In the 1990s, many Native authored books for children were published, including the work of Louise Erdrich (Ojibwa), Joy Harjo (Muscogee Creek Nation), Michael Lacapa (Apache/Hopi/Tewa), Gayle Ross (Cherokee Nation), Cynthia Leitich Smith (Muscogee Creek), Joseph McLellan (Nez Perce), N. Scott Momaday (Kiowa), Cheryl Savageau (Abenaki/Metis), Jan Waboose (Anishinaabe), and Bernelda Wheeler (Cree). In 2007, Sherman Alexie joined the growing list of Native authors writing for children with the release of his young adult fiction The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian. Critically acclaimed, it won the National Book Award. Literary criticism Native authors are working to counter stereotypical portrayals of American Indians. Alongside them are Native and non-Native scholars who critique classic, award-winning, best-selling books by and about American Indians. Two examples are Slapin and Seale‚Äôs Through Indian Eyes: The Native Experience in Books for Children and Seale and Slapin‚Äôs A Broken Flute: The Native Experience in Books for Children.

He also travelled to Nazi Austria on his own initiative and at his own expense and helped save Jewish people from being sent to concentration camps. Early life Butler was born on 23 October 1900 to George Butler and Harriet Clarke, at the family home of Maiden Hall outside the village of Bennettsbridge in County Kilkenny. Butler graduated in 1922 from St John's College, Oxford, where he studied classics. After being recruited by Sir Horace Plunkett to work for the Irish County Libraries from graduation until 1926, Butler later travelled extensively in Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia, Macedonia and Montenegro before working with the Quakers in Vienna expediting the escape of Jews after the Anschluss. Butler's father, George Butler, was teaching practical agriculture to Gerald Gallagher on the farm at Maiden Hall when Gallagher applied for a position in the British colonial service, where he became the first officer-in-charge of the Phoenix Islands Settlement Scheme, the last colonial expansion of the British Empire. Upon the death of George Butler in 1941, Hubert Butler inherited Maiden Hall and returned to live with his family in the house on the banks of the River Nore until his death in 1991. His wife, Susan Margaret ‚Äî usually referred to as Peggy ‚Äî was sister of the theatre director Tyrone Guthrie and the moving force behind foundation of the Kilkenny Art Gallery Society. Tyrone Guthrie was instrumental in establishing internationally renowned Stratford Theatre Stratford Theatre in Stratford, Ontario, Canada. Today, the Butler homestead remains in the family, with part of it operating as an ongoing business under the tutelage of his granddaughter, Suzanna Crampton, as Zwartbles Ireland. Suzanna continues the tradition of her grandfather Hubert, and her godmother Pamela Travers, by practicing ecological farming and writing books and giving public talks. She maintains an active Twitter account, ZwartblesIE, documenting the farm and her activities. Historian and writer Butler sought to encourage understanding of Irish social and political history through study of the land, the people and the primary source materials. He was a co-reviver of the Kilkenny Archaeological Society and through it promoted Catholic-Protestant reconciliation. Always stylish and subtle, his writing used local events as parables for the politics and pressures that accompanied the emergence of the Irish state. His book Ten Thousand Saints was a virtuoso performance, concluding with a theory that the apparently absurd legends of Irish prehistory and theology could provide evidence of the migration of Iron-age tribes around Europe. He illustrated the point by reference to local history and scholarship. Having argued that the saints of Ireland were disguised personifications of the tribes and political factions of Iron-age Ireland, he went on to suggest that the Old Testament could be the same for Jewish prehistory. Saving Jews from the Holocaust In 1938 Butler was disgusted at the anti-Semitic comments in Ireland particularly those of Oliver J. Flanagan who in a statement to the D√°il said ‚ÄúThey (the Jews) crucified our Saviour 1,900 years ago and they have been crucifying us every day of the week\\". In response to comments like this Butler wrote that ‚ÄúI was as Irish as Oliver Flanagan and I was determined that Jewish refugees should come to Ireland\\" He then traveled to Austria and the first people he saved were Erwin Strunz, his wife and two children, who he helped travel from Austria to Ireland. He continued saving lives and working with both the Irish Quakers and American Quakers secured exit visas for dozen of Jews to escape from Vienna to Ireland and helped them to settle in the Americas. Post WW2 After giving a broadcast talk in 1947 about Yugoslavia he was publicly criticised for failing to mention the alleged suffering of Catholics under Josip Broz Tito's regime. He responded by trying to draw attention to another matter he had avoided in his radio talk, and which he saw as a greater scandal: the involvement of Catholic clergy with the Usta≈°a, a Nazi-installed puppet regime that had waged a genocidal crusade against non-Catholics in part of Yugoslavia during World War II. Butler's efforts in this respect earned him notoriety and public opprobrium in clerical Ireland to the extent that he felt obliged to leave the archaeological society he had played a big part in reviving.The sub-prefect should have held his tongue, Hubert Butler, Allen Lane The Penguin Press, London 1990 (pp 271-2, 279-280). Butler was a keen market gardener as well as a writer and his circle of friends included the Mary Poppins creator Pamela Travers, the journalist Claud Cockburn, and the poet Padraic Colum. He believed strongly in the importance of the family and, as well as playing an active role in keeping his own extended family in touch, he was the founder of the Butler Society. He is buried five miles from the family home at St. Peter's Church, Ennisnag, Kilkenny. The Kilkenny Art Gallery Society's Butler Gallery in Kilkenny Castle was named in honour of Hubert and Peggy.

The Nadder forms the northern border of the parish; to the south are chalk hills. The parish is bisected by the A30 road. The village contains some 25 privately owned houses, a village hall, and a cricket pitch used by Compton Chamberlayne Cricket Club.\\"Compton Chamberlayne Cricket Club\\" History Most of the inhabited part of the village lies in a small wooded valley that lends credence to the origin of the name \\"Compton\\" ‚Äì coombe tun, or \\"settlement in a wooded valley\\". \\"Chamberlayne\\" seems to have been attached when a Robert le Chamberlayne, or possibly Geoffrey le Chaumberlang, took possession of the village in the Middle Ages. The village was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, which shows that the local manor had a mill, some pastureland, meadows and two woods at that time. Today there is no evidence of the manor. There was a day school in the village in 1819, which had 60 pupils in 1859; around that time it was funded entirely by the Penruddock family of Compton House. By 1871, government grants were received under the National School system. The school closed in 1933 as pupil numbers fell. During World War I, thousands of Australian and Canadian troops camped in the fields to the north of the chalk downland, before being shipped to France for combat. Compton Chamberlayne burial ground has 28 graves of Australian soldiers who died, believed to be of influenza, during their transit through the camp. There is still today a field called \\"hospital\\", previously the site of the military medical facility. The only tangible sign of the previous occupation was an outline of Australia carved in the surface of the chalk downs () to the south-east of the village, which was left to grass over in 2005. In 2018/2019, a group of local volunteers restored the map and marked Anzac Day with a service there, However, the neighbouring village of Fovant has an impressive display of army regimental badges carved into the chalk downs. Compton Chamberlayne also features a folly in the form of a summer house at . The former location of the Australian map Parish church St Michael's Church The Anglican Church of St Michael, close to Compton House, was built at the end of the 13th century in the Early English style, at the same time as Salisbury Cathedral some seven miles away. Further work was done in the 14th and 15th centuries, with restoration in 1877 by James Soppitt of Shaftesbury. It contains the Penruddocke family vault and has a peal of six bells, two dating from the 17th century and four from the 19th.\\"St Michael's, Compton Chamberlayne\\" at Doves' Guide. The church is a Grade II* listed building. The benefice is served by the Nadder Valley team ministry. Compton House Compton House Compton House (or Compton Park House) was the seat of the Penruddocke (or Penruddock) family from the mid-16th century until 1930. The present house may occupy the site of a medieval manor house; Pevsner saw fragments of medieval work. It was refitted internally by Sir Edward Penruddocke in the late 17th century and rebuilt externally in 1780 by Charles Penruddocke. The drawing room from about 1700 has panelling and rich decoration in Grinling Gibbons style, with a plaster ceiling from the same period. In the dining room, part of the 1780 additions, is a plaster ceiling in Adam style. The stable block is also from the late 18th century. The house is a Grade I listed building. The house is set in parkland, once a medieval deer park. It overlooks an artificial lake formed by damming a stream running north into the Nadder.

It was to be ported to the Xbox, Game Boy Advance and Microsoft Windows; all three were cancelled. Charlie's Angels is based on the first and second film in the series. It follows the continuing adventures of private investigators Alex Munday (Lucy Liu), Dylan Sanders (Drew Barrymore) and Natalie Cook (Cameron Diaz) as they attempt to solve the mystery of a series of missing national monuments. The heroines do not use firearms but can utilize blunt weapons and certain environmental objects. The game is notable for being panned by critics and has been regarded as one of the worst video games ever made. Gameplay The gameplay is very simple and involves fighting groups of enemies by performing punching and kicking combinations or by using weapons. Each group of enemies must be defeated before the player is allowed to progress through the game. While the player is engaged in a fight, movement to another area is impossible as invisible walls will block their way. It also featured an option to switch from playing one Angel to another. However, this option is not available during a fight and it is not required to complete the game. Occasionally, one Angel must perform a task such as pressing a switch, pulling a lever or accessing a computer so that another Angel is allowed to progress. Most levels end when all of the Angels have completed their current objective. Unlockables such as trailers and photographs from the movie Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle can be unlocked by collecting items such as film reels and memory sticks, which are hidden in each level. Plot The game begins on a beach beauty pageant runway. Wearing swimsuits, Natalie and Alex must each individually fight their way from the beach through the community and warehouses to the docks. Joined there by Dylan, the three continue to each fight their way through a series of further locations. Reception Charlie's Angels received an average score of 24% at GameRankings and an average score of 23/100 at Metacritic, indicating \\"generally unfavorable\\" reviews. On GameRankings, the GameCube version of the game holds the lowest score on the site. GamesRadar ranked it as the 50th worst game ever made. The staff commented that the game was even worse than the movie it was based on.

The film stars Colin Firth, Ian Holm, Donald Pleasence, Nicol Williamson, Jim Carter and Amina Annabi. It was released in the United States as The Advocate. The film is usually categorised as a drama, although it could also be classified as a mystery or a black comedy. For its UK theatrical release, the film was given a 15 certificate,\\"Feature Film: THE HOUR OF THE PIG\\" BBFC.co.uk while the North American release was rated R, primarily due to its nudity and sexual content. Plot The Hour of the Pig is set in 15th-century France and is based upon the career and case files of Bartholomew Chassenee, an actual lawyer of the time who served as an advocate for animals who were accused of crimes.Marston, David W.; \\"Entertaining stories fill docket in court lore\\" Baltimore Sun, 4 September 2005 At the time, animal trials were used to determine if animals were the perpetrators of supernatural mayhem.Kadri, Sadakat; \\"The Trial: A History from Socrates to O.J. Simpson\\" HarperCollins, 3 July 2006 () Animals were subject to the same civil laws and penalties as human beings under French law, 1403‚Äì1596. Richard Courtois (Firth) and his clerk Mathieu (Carter) have left the decadence of Paris in order to practise law in what they believe to be a quiet rural village, Abbeville, in the province of Ponthieu, then part of Burgundy rather than France. Courtois quickly becomes involved in a number of back-logged cases. For his first case, he defends a farmer who is accused of killing his wife's lover. Courtois gets him acquitted (the farmer mutters, \\"I should have done him years ago\\" as he leaves and offers to help Courtois any time). In his next case, Courtois fails to save Jeannine, a woman accused of witchcraft. He asks for rats to be called as witnesses to testify that she did not bribe them to infect her neighbor; when the rats do not appear the following day as summoned, this charge is struck off. However, Courtois is unfamiliar with the difference between the Roman law of France and the Ponthieu customary law, and she is sentenced to be hanged anyway. As she is led away she tells Courtois, \\"There is darkness all about you, you can bring the light. Look to the boy, ma√Ætre. Look to the boy.\\" At her execution, Jeannine says she will not curse the town but blesses it, saying a fine knight will arrive and deliver them from their lying and evil. Courtois takes on a case defending a pig that is accused of killing a young Jewish boy. The pig, however, belongs to a band of Moors (alternatively/first thought to be Gypsies, being referred to as coming from \\"Little Egypt\\") passing through town. Two of the Moors, Mahmoud (Sami Bouajila) and his sister Samira (Annabi), appeal to Courtois to save the pig, as it is their only source of food for the coming winter. Courtois declines. Samira later enters Courtois's room at night and quietly strips naked, offering her body in return for his services, but he refuses this. The next day he offers her enough money to purchase two pigs, but she does not accept this. As Courtois delves deeper into the case and becomes more involved with Samira, he discovers that there is more at work than a simple murder. His work is brought to the attention of Seigneur Jehan d'Auferre (Williamson), who has his own designs on Courtois. Soon, Courtois finds that he is being used as a pawn in a complicated game of sociopolitical intrigue that extends beyond mere racism and corruption. The Seigneur subtly offers to bribe Courtois, also hinting that his daughter Filette is available in marriage. The Seigneur's son and daughter are eccentric to the point of insanity. The son's main hobby seems to be torturing birds. Courtois's relationship with Samira becomes common knowledge. The Seigneur decides to sit in at court and uses this knowledge to threaten Courtois into letting the pig be executed. Just as the case seems to be over, the Advent festival begins and the case is adjourned. The prosecutor Pincheon (Pleasence) tells Courtois that he moved from Paris to Ponthieu as Courtois did, in order to shine in a village in a way he could not in Paris. He urges Courtois to go back to Paris and not waste his life among ignorant, superstitious peasants. The skeleton of another Jewish boy who went missing over a year ago is found while Courtois's house is being built. Courtois now suspects a human serial killer is at large and the pig has been framed. On Christmas Day, Samira performs for a gathering of notables at the Seigneur's chateau. She is almost arrested for drawing a knife on the Seigneur's son after he pours wine down her blouse. Courtois boldly leads her away. That night, he rescues a boy from a masked horseman wielding an axe. Courtois confronts the Seigneur, telling him his son is the killer. The Seigneur does not deny it and reveals that his son has left for England to be treated. At the trial, the pig is acquitted when Valliere, the farmer Courtois saved in his first case at Abbeville, brings in a replica pig which he claims absconded at the time of the killing. As Courtois leaves, he sees a knight arriving just as Jeannine had foretold. After he has left, the knight takes off his armor to reveal that he bears the characteristic buboes of the Black Death. US version The Hour of the Pig was released in the United States by Miramax as The Advocate. Harvey Weinstein was actively involved in the cuts of films distributed by Miramax, this film was no exception. For US release, the film was trimmed down, including a sex scene, that was edited in part to avoid a stronger than R rating. The name of the film was changed as part of an advertising campaign. The US film poster and opening crawl instruct the audience not to \\"reveal the client\\". The campaign did not improve sales for the film. UK version The UK version was released on VHS. Only the shorter (R-rated) version of the film was released to VHS or DVD in North America. The full version has been released on DVD and screened on television in some European countries. Changes Besides the titles, there are many differences between The Advocate (US) and The Hour Of The Pig (UK). These include: *US version begins with music from the film and an opening crawl of text. UK version goes straight into the film. The US and UK versions end with different text before the end credits roll. *Different voice takes for some scenes *Different music or no music for some scenes *Amina Annabi's voice is dubbed in the US version *A speech made towards the end of the film by Donald Pleasence was shortened for the US version *In the original version, Sophie Dix gives a short voice-over at the end of the film. In the US version, Jim Carter gives a short voice-over near the beginning of the film, and near the end. Harvey Weinstein Scandal When the revelations of the Harvey Weinstein story first broke, one of the early accusers was Sophie Dix. She had claimed that he \\"performed an unwelcome sexual act in her presence after she was invited up his room at the Savoy hotel 'to watch some rushes'\\" for The Hour of The Pig. She called the experience ‚Äúthe single most damaging thing that‚Äôs happened in my life‚Äù. Some of her scenes in the UK version of the film (including an explicit sex scene), as well as a short voice over, were trimmed or cut. It has been suggested that Weinstein had done this as retribution for her attempted rejection of his advances.

History Achille Maramotti began designing couture clothing in 1947, and officially established the House of Max Mara in 1951. The \\"Mara\\" came from his surname, while \\"Max\\" referred to Count Max, a local character who was seldom sober but always stylish. Maramotti was one of the first to see that the future of fashion lay in the mass production of designer-quality clothes. He was also keen to emphasise the brand of Max Mara ahead of the names of individual designers, even though he employed Karl Lagerfeld, Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, Dolce & Gabbana, Narciso Rodriguez and Anne Marie Beretta. The company remains in the hands of the family. Brands Max Mara has spawned 35 labels, although Max Mara womenswear remains the core of the company. Other brands include Sportmax, Sportmax Code, Weekend Max Mara, Marella, Pennyblack, iBlues, MAX&Co.; (the trendy, youth division), and Marina Rinaldi.

The genera Phausis and Lamprohiza are very similar and in need of revision; the delimitations between the two are not clear.

Description Phausis males are small compared to many fireflies, ranging from about . Most are brown to brown-black in colour and have transparent \\"window\\" spots in the front half of the pronotum. A key characteristic distinguishing adult male Phausis from most other firefly genera is the presence of a minute glassy bead at the tip of each antenna. Males have huge eyes. Female Phausis specimens are assumed to be larviform; the females have not been discovered, possibly because they often live in burrows in the soil, so are not easily collected. Most males are not luminescent, while females are likely to emit bioluminescence in the form of a continuous glow. Males of the species Phausis reticulata also emit a faint, constant glow.

A cycle of oxidative addition and reductive elimination on the copper centre then creates a new carbon-carbon bond. Scope Unlike the related Glaser coupling the Cadiot‚ÄìChodkiewicz coupling proceeds selectively and will only couple the alkyne to the haloalkyne, giving a single product. By comparison the Glaser coupling would simply produce a distribution of all possible couplings. In one study the Cadiot‚ÄìChodkiewicz coupling has been applied in the synthesis of acetylene macrocycles starting from cis-1,4-diethynyl-1,4-dimethoxycyclohexa-2,5-diene. This compound is also the starting material for the dibromide through N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) and silver nitrate: Cadiot‚ÄìChodkiewicz coupling application The coupling reaction itself takes place in methanol with piperidine, the hydrochloric acid salt of hydroxylamine and copper(I) bromide.

CODEN became particularly common in the scientific community as a citation system for periodicals cited in technical and chemistry-related publications and as a search tool in many bibliographic catalogues. History The CODEN, designed by Charles Bishop (of the Chronic Disease Research Institute at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York, retired), was initially thought as a memory aid for the publications in his reference collection. Bishop took initial letters of words from periodical titles thereby using a code, which helped him arranging the collected publications. In 1953 he published his documentation system, originally designed as a four letter CODEN system; volume and page numbers have been added, in order to cite and locate exactly an article in a magazine.Bishop, Charles: \\"An integrated approach to the documentation problem\\". In: American Documentation (, CODEN AMDOA7), Vol. 4, p. 54‚Äì65 (1953). Later, a variation was published 1957.Bishop, Charles: \\"Use of the CODEN system by the individual research scientist\\". In: American Documentation (, CODEN AMDOA7), Vol. 8, p. 221‚Äì226 (1957). After Bishop had assigned about 4,000 CODEN, the four letter CODEN system was further developed since 1961 by L.E. Kuentzel at the American Society for Testing of Material (ASTM). He also introduced the fifth character to CODEN.Kuentzel, L. E.: \\"Current status of the CODEN Project\\". In: Special Libraries (), Vol. 57, p. 404‚Äì406 (1966)Kuentzel, L. E.: \\"CODEN for periodical titles, Vol. 1 ; Periodical titles by CODEN, non-periodical titles, deleted CODEN\\". In: ASTM data series publication, American Society for Testing and Materials (); Vol. 23 A (1966).Kuentzel, L. E.: \\"CODEN for periodical titles, Vol. 2 ; Periodical titles by title\\". In: ASTM data series publication, American Society for Testing and Materials (); Vol. 23 A (1966). In the beginning of the computer age the CODEN was thought as a machine-readable identification system for periodicals. In several updates since 1963, CODEN were registered and published in the CODEN for Periodical Titles by ASTM, counting to about 128,000 at the end of 1974. Although it was soon recognized in 1966 that a five character CODEN would not be sufficient to provide all future periodical titles with CODEN, it was still defined as a five character code as given in ASTM standard E250 until 1972.ASTM Standard E 250-72: Standard recommended practice for use of CODEN for Periodical Title Abbreviations. Philadelphia. ASTM, 1972. In 1976 the ASTM standard E250-76 defined a six-character CODEN.ASTM Standard E 250-76: Standard recommended practice for use of CODEN for Periodical Title Abbreviations. Philadelphia. ASTM, 1976. Beginning in the year 1975, the CODEN system was within the responsibility of the American Chemical Society.Anon: \\"Chemical Abstract Service assumes ASTM CODEN assignment\\". In: Journal of Library Automation (), Vol. 8, p. 12 (1975). Today, the first four characters of the six-character CODEN for a periodical are taken from the initial letters of the words from its title, followed by a fifth letter‚Äîone of the first six letters (A‚ÄìF) of the alphabet. The sixth and last character of the CODEN is an alphanumeric check character calculated from the preceding letters. CODEN always uses capital letters. In contrast to a periodical CODEN, the first two characters of a CODEN assigned to a non-serial publication (e.g. conference proceedings) are digits. The third and fourth characters are letters. The fifth and sixth character corresponds to the serial CODEN, but differs in that the fifth character is taken from all letters of the alphabet. In 1975, the International CODEN Service located at Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) became responsible for further development of the CODEN. The CODEN is automatically assigned to all publications referred on CAS. On request of publishers the International CODEN Service also assigns CODEN for non chemistry-related publications. For this reason CODEN may also be found in other data bases (e.g. RTECS, or BIOSIS), and are assigned also to serials or magazines, which are not referred in CAS. Current sources CODEN assigned until 1966 can be looked up at the two-volume CODEN for Periodical Titles issued by L.E. Kuentzel. CODEN assigned until 1974 were published by J.G. Blumenthal.Blumenthal, Jennifer G. (ed.): \\"CODEN for periodical titles, Part 1 ; Periodical titles arranged CODEN\\".

CODEN assigned until 1998 and their disintegration can be found at the International CODEN Directory (ISSN 0364-3670), which has been published since 1980 as a microfiches issue. Finding a current CODEN is now best done with the online database of CASSI (Chemical Abstracts Service Source Index), covering all registered titles, CODEN, ISSN, ISBN, abbreviations for publications indexed by CAS since 1907, including serial and non-serial scientific and technical publications. CASSI online is the replacement for CASSI as a printed serial issue (ISSN 0738-6222, CODEN CASSE2), or as the Collective Index (0001-0634, CODEN CASSI6). CASSI will no longer be published in print.

History  St. John was founded in 1962 by former model Marie St John and her husband Robert Gray. While working in Los Angeles as a model, St John hand knit simple straight knit skirts and matching short sleeved tops for her own use. Her designs proved popular among her fellow models and she began designing and producing samples. Her fianc√© at the time, Robert Gray, showed the designs to local retailer Bullocks who ordered 84 dresses. St John and Gray hired their mothers and another knitter and quickly set about production. The couple, now married, divided duties over the fledgling Irvine, CA business. St John designed the clothes and oversaw production while Gray handled the marketing and sales. Their collections included tailored suits and dresses as well as casual sportswear. In 1990, Escada, formed by another husband and wife team Margaretha and Wolfgang Ley, purchased an 80% stake in St John Knits for $45 million. St John Knits used the funding to launch its own boutique stores. St John became a publicly owned company in 1993, with St John and Gray retaining 20% of the company. St John continued to manage the creative direction of the company while Gray served as CEO and Chairman of the Board. Their daughter, Kelly Gray, was appointed President of the company in 1996, ascending to the CEO position after her father's retirement in 2002. The Grays left St John Knits in 2005 when the company was purchased by a private equity firm.https://articles.latimes.com/2005/jul/26/business/fi-stjohn26 The pair were brought back only two years later as creative consultants after a series of disappointing collections and declining sales. The original face of the brand was model Kelly Gray, the daughter of the founders. Following Gray, supermodel Gisele B√ºndchen became the new face of St. John in 2005.https://articles.latimes.com/2005/aug/09/entertainment/et-stjohn9 Beginning in 2005, Angelina Jolie became the face and spokeswoman for St. John. The campaigns were all shot by Mario Testino. In 2010, St. John announced that they were replacing Jolie with British supermodel and musician Karen Elson after her three-year campaign as the face of the company, because Jolie's fame had \\"overshadowed the brand.\\" In 2011, Kate Winslet was named the face of St John, a position she continues to hold as of 2015. ‚Ä≥St. John Knits' carved a lasting place for itself in the business world by selling to large, established retailers such as Jacobson's and Lord & Taylor, cultivating a relationship that would propel its growth for decades. Underpinning its respected standing among retailers were the company's distinctive lines of clothing, which began to attract a devout clientele drawn to Marie St. John's classically conservative fashion style. As one retail consultant explained, \\"For ladies who lunch, a St. John knit is almost like a uniform, a status symbol,\\" which neatly described the company's typical retail customer and conveyed the essence of the clothes' success: generations of women made the inclusion of a St. John knit in their wardrobe a must.‚Ä≥International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 14. St. James Press, 1996. A St. John's garment can be identified by its knit-in hem (most companies use sewn-in hems) and the tightly woven wool and rayon double knit fabric developed by Marie St John in 1962. The St. John Sport line contains more on trend styles.  St. John today  Headquartered in Irvine, California, the brand has its collections and styles sold in specialty stores in 29 countries and 27 company-owned retail boutiques in the United States. The company has an estimated 1,300 employees and 2010 sales of $325 million. They have recently begun selling designer masks that do not work to stop the spread of covid-19 because they are made with a knit rayon rather than 2 layers of tightly woven cotton that is recommended by the CDC. There has been some backlash to which their defense is a disclaimer citing that their masks are not effective as PPE and are not intended to be used as such.</r The team of stylists is led by Zoe Turner, a British designer who comes from Christian Dior Couture, Alberta Ferretti and Max Mara. Having completed the european phase, based between Paris, where Turner resides,and Milan, the new creative director has just relocated in Irvine. Turner is responsible for St. John‚Äôs collections, retail environments and the 57-year-old firm‚Äôs multimedia presence. Turner‚Äôs first collection for St. John will be fall 2020.

Route description State Route 290 begins at an intersection with US 95 approximately north of Winnemucca near the Santa Rosa Range. From the junction, the highway heads northeasterly through a valley known as Paradise Valley while paralleling Martin Creek, a fork of the Little Humboldt River. The road turns more northerly after about as it heads into the town of Paradise Valley. Once inside the town, SR 290 turns east on Bridge Street to come to its northern terminus on a small bridge over Big Cottonwood Creek. History SR 290 was established as State Route 8B by 1932 SR 290 was originally numbered as State Route 8B. SR 8B had been established as a graveled road by 1932, approximately following the alignment of the present- day highway. The route was completely paved by 1940. No major changes were made to State Route 8B during its existence. The route number remained active until the renumbering of Nevada's state highways that began on July 1, 1976.

The Humber Valley is formed by the Humber River. The upper part of the valley follows the Upper Humber River (upstream from Deer Lake) and contains the communities of Reidville and Cormack. After the river discharges into Deer Lake, the valley broadens to include the entire width of the lake including the town of Deer Lake, as well as the local service districts of St. Jude‚Äôs and Pynn‚Äôs Brook, and the community of Pasadena. The valley narrows at the western end of the lake where it discharges into the Lower Humber River. This remaining part of the valley includes the local service district of Little Rapids, as well as the Humber Valley Golf Resort which is adjacent to the Marble Mountain Ski Resort, and the community of Steady Brook. The valley ends at the eastern end of Corner Brook where the river discharges into the Bay of Islands at the appropriately named \\"Humbermouth\\". The Humber Valley region has a population of about 36,000, making it the major hub for Western Newfoundland. It is considered one of the most picturesque areas of the province. The Humber Valley region is sometimes extended to include the communities of Howley, Jackson's Arm and Hampden.

Electoral representation Federally, the region is represented by the riding of Long Range Mountains. Provincially it is spread across three districts: Corner Brook, Humber-Gros Morne, and Humber-Bay of Islands. Economy People in the region work in many different areas like the Kruger pulp mill in Corner Brook, which has a major economic presence in the region; this mill also operates the Deer Lake hydro-electric generating station. The Deer Lake Regional Airport, along with various government departments and facilities, Grenfell Campus, Memorial University, limited agriculture, and a growing tourism industry centred on the Humber Valley Resort, the Marble Mountain Ski Resort, and the region's proximity to Gros Morne National Park are major economic instigators.

With a student roll of 1200, the school has been judged by Ofsted as outstanding for two consecutive inspections (2011 and 2014). In September 2006, the school was renamed from 'White Hart Lane secondary school' to 'Woodside High School'. Having had a chequered reputation, its head teacher Joan McVittie decided to give the school a make-over, with new uniforms and a new reputation. The school is now one of the best schools in Haringey, being 3rd in the Haringey league tables and in the top 25 of the most improved schools in the country. It carries a new reputation that is highly valued by the students. The school was built in 1962. History The history of Woodside High School can be traced back through a number of renamings and mergers since its first predecessor schools were founded in 1884. In 1884 separate boys' and girls' Higher Grade schools were founded in Wood Green but by 1898 had become overcrowded and in 1899 merged when they both moved into a new building in Bounds Green Road. Wood Green Higher Grade school, as it was called, was taken over by the Middlesex education committee in 1921, closed and then reopened as Trinity county grammar school. Technical education, started in 1892 under the Technical Instruction Act of 1889, developed quickly after the opening of Tottenham Polytechnic in 1897. Wood Green county school was established by Middlesex County Council in Glendale Avenue as a mixed grammar school in 1910 and was later renamed Glendale county school. It amalgamated with Trinity county grammar to form Wood Green Grammar school in 1962 and then moved to White Hart Lane, leaving the Glendale Avenue site for Woodside school whilst Trinity county grammar's premises were taken over by the newly established Parkwood school. St. Thomas More upper school took over the Glendale Avenue site in 1967 and at the same time Wood Green Grammar became Wood Green comprehensive school. The new Wood Green comprehensive school also absorbed boys from Woodside school and some girls from Parkwood school. In Tottenham in 1901, Tottenham County School was founded at Grove House in anticipation of the Education Act 1902. It was the first school that offered an alternative to the Tottenham Grammar School in the area and was also the first co-educational school of its kind in Middlesex.A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 5, Hendon, Kingsbury, Great Stanmore, Little Stanmore, Edmonton Enfield, Monken Hadley, South Mimms, Tottenham. Originally published by Victoria County History, London, 1976. Pages 364-376 It originally shared Grove House with Tottenham polytechnic but in 1913 moved into a new building on the Green. Like Tottenham high school for girls, established in 1885, it was modelled on the grammar school and these three schools along with the Roman Catholic St. Ignatius's college, provided for Tottenham's educational needs. Tottenham County School in 1963 moved to new buildings at Selby Road, Devonshire Hill, next to the playing fields. In 1967, Tottenham county school premises were taken over by Tottenham school and by 1972 a sixth-form centre and a sports hall had been added. In 1983 Tottenham School vacated the site when it merged with Wood Green comprehensive school and became White Hart Lane School, the premises on Selby Road later becoming the Selby Centre. In 2006 the school once again changed its name becoming Woodside High School. Location and buildings The school is located on White hart lane in Wood Green, in the London Borough of Haringey, North London. It is central to many sport facilities such as a football ground and tennis court opposite the building, New River sport centre and a rugby field for London Scholars rugby league are also nearby. The school is approximately a 20-minute walk from Wood Green Shopping Centre Redevelopments Over the past few years, the school has approximately spent 650 million pounds on refurbishment and rebuilding works. The school now benefits from a number of facilities, new buildings and technology. A new school for children with disabilities was built on site with Woodside and was named Riverside School. Specialist and academy status The school was given specialist status in Business and Enterprise in September 2004. the school converted to academy status in December 2011. Ofsted reports The Ofsted Inspections in 2011 and 2014 both rated the school as outstanding. In recent years the school's reports have increased dramatically.

The series also aired on Warner Channel in Latin America, Nine Network in Australia, and on TV2 in New Zealand. It first was broadcast on Wednesdays at 9:00 but, due to low ratings, it was rescheduled to Mondays at 9:00, in the hope viewers of the hit series Prison Break would stay tuned. On November 13, 2006, the show was put on hiatus, but two days later the network announced it was shifting it to Fridays at 8:00 to replace the canceled Vanished. Fourteen episodes of the series were ordered, of which 13 episodes were produced. Twelve of the episodes of Justice have aired in the United States with the final episode airing in Mexico, the UK and Germany. Premise Justice is about a team of lawyers from different backgrounds who work at the Los Angeles law firm of Trott, Nicholson, Tuller & Graves (TNT&G;) and defend clients involved in controversial and newsworthy cases. While criminal defense is most common, other cases may strike the interest of the firm such as wrongful death and other civil cases. As the title implies, the viewer discovers whether or not \\"justice\\" has been served following the verdict, when what really transpired is revealed to the audience. Cast and characters =Ron Trott= : Portrayed by Victor Garber He is the head of TNT&G.; His overbearing personality and gleefully amoral approach to the practice of law make him exasperating to many‚Äîincluding juries‚Äîbut he is a skilled, media-savvy lawyer who shares a good rapport and working relationship with his other TNT&G; partners. He also has some degree of ethics despite his amorality; when he realizes that the woman he had once loved did indeed murder her son in cold blood he's legitimately heartbroken and is upset when he realizes they helped a guilty man escape justice He is the face seen on every media talk show in the country‚Äîand he wants it that way. He's great at landing a client, spinning a case and getting his way, but juries hate him. It was his inspiration and win-at-all-cost mentality that brought this group of brilliant, ego-driven attorneys together. =Tom Nicholson= : Portrayed by Kerr Smith He is an idealistic trial lawyer. A native of a small Nebraska town, Hastings, he had a younger sister who died in her late teens. He is only comfortable defending clients whom he believes to be innocent. His youth and appealing demeanor as the all-American face of \\"not guilty\\" are cited by Ron as the reason that Tom (rather than Ron himself) should lead most trial representations. In spite of this, he did have some degree of prejudice against people who aren't quite \\"normal\\" (as seen in the episode Crucified); after this results in an innocent teenager getting convicted he becomes filled with guilt and wants to handle the appeal despite not being an appealate lawyer. Tom is a brilliant litigator whose everyman, earnest manner makes him Ron's alter ego. Trials are won and lost on the art of battle in the courtroom, and Tom is a master of his domain. He has expressed interest in Alden. =Alden Tuller= : Portrayed by Rebecca Mader She processes the physical evidence and hires experts for courtroom demonstrations. She frequently goes to Dr. Shaw for insight. Although she is unmarried, Alden wears a wedding ring in court in the belief that it helps jurors trust her. Unlike Tom, she prefers to believe that her firm's clients are guilty rather than innocent, so she won't be disappointed if they lose. In spite of this, she does have somewhat of a softer side for teenage clients, and is more willing to believe in their innocence (during the two episodes where the firm defends teenage clients Alden is in charge of preparing them for trial and looking after them.) =Luther Graves= : Portrayed by Eamonn Walker Graves is a former prosecutor turned defense lawyer. A leader in the African-American political community, he is well-connected, politically motivated and in possession of an uncanny ability to take a step back and assess the merits of a case from both the prosecution's and the defense's perspective‚Äîanticipating the story each side will tell. His role at TNT&G; frequently centers on predicting the moves of the prosecution (or the opposing party in civil suits). In \\"Prior Convictions\\" he is forced to defend a man he had previously convicted; over the course of the episode he learns that the man, Joshua Morton, had been convicted more because of his lawyer's incompetence and the jury's prejudice than anything Graves had done, and later is presented with proof that Joshua could not have committed the crime. He is fluent in Spanish, as seen in the show's last episode. =Recurring cast and characters= *Katherine LaNasa as Suzanne Fulcrum, the host of a cable news program called American Crime. Her coverage of the case in question is featured in several episodes. Suzanne has something of a love/hate relationship with Trott. While she likes the popularity of the cases tried by his firm, she despises his attempts to use her show to his advantage. *Aunjanue Ellis as Miranda Lee, a jury consultant frequently employed by TNT&G.; She possesses an uncanny insight into the mindset of potential jurors, and her input is often invaluable as the firm develops its legal strategies. *Mark Deklin as Dr. Matthew Shaw, a scientific expert hired by TNT&G; to help with crime recreations. *Erin Daniels as Betsy Harrison, an ex-LAPD employee who worked with Luther back when he was a DA. She currently works as the firm's private investigator. Appears in \\"Addicts\\", \\"Crucified\\", and \\"Shotgun\\". *Will Owens as Paralegal Pete, a member of the legal team at TNT&G.; Appears in \\"Pretty Woman,\\" \\"Behind the Orange Curtain,\\" and \\"Wrongful Death.\\" *Paul Schulze as J.D. Keller, the District Attorney often is on the opposing side of cases tried by TNT&G.; Appears in \\"Pretty Woman\\", \\"Crucified\\", and \\"Prior Conviction\\". *Dahlia Salem as Susan Hale, a District Attorney on the opposing side of a few cases tried by TNT&G.; Appears in \\"Prior Conviction\\", \\"Shotgun\\", and \\"Christmas Party\\".

He made significant contributions to the study of medicine, politics and law. Descended from Lutheran clergy on both sides of his family, second-youngest of ten children, Conring showed early promise as a student. During his life as a professor in North Germany, Conring addressed himself first to medicine, producing significant studies on blood circulation, and later in his career addressed himself to politics.  Early life  Conring was born in Norden, a coastal town in East Frisia, a territory ruled at that time by the counts of Cirksena. Like many areas of what would later become Germany, Conring's homeland exhibited considerable religious variety and strife. Lutheran in the countryside (and in the piety of its counts), East Frisia nonetheless sheltered a bastion of Calvinism in its chief city, Emden. Conring and his family were no strangers to confessional altercations. Many of Conring's forebears were ministers, and his father and paternal grandfather, in particular, were apparently compelled to change their circumstances on several occasions in response to Protestant religious conflict. Conring was one of ten siblings, two of whom died in infancy, six more of whom died of the plague in 1611.  Schooling  Conring began his schooling early, as befit a descendant of literate clerical forebears, entering school in Norden at the age of six, and beginning his studies in Latin a year later. About ninety years earlier, Luther had bestowed a powerful legitimacy upon the German language with his translation of the Bible into German, but, as in other European countries, Latin remained the official language of learning for centuries. By the age of 14, Conring had developed into a skilled Latinist, broadly familiar with ancient classical writings and with the leading Latin writers of his own day and region. In 1620, at the age of 14, Conring began to take courses in the philosophy curriculum at the University of Helmstedt, one of the leading northern European universities of its day, where he would study for the next five years. Teaching Lindenfeld calls Conring a Neo- Aristotelian.Lindenfeld 1997, p. 18. The term philosophy meant something rather different in his time. It referred to a branch of inquiry that sought chiefly to explicate law, religion and politics in terms laid down by ancient thinkers, particularly Aristotle, who in Conring's circles would often have been known simply as \\"the philosopher\\". Lindenfeld says that in 1660 Conring was the first to lecture on Statistik, the forerunner of modern government statistics; but the topic was political science.Lindenfeld 1997, p. 20.

Independent Democrat is not a political party. Several elected officials, including members of Congress, have identified as Independent Democrats. History The first member of the United States House of Representatives to identify as an Independent Democrat was Zadok Casey of Illinois, who served from 1833 to 1843. Casey was a Jacksonian Democrat before becoming an Independent.https://bioguideretro.congress.gov/Home/MemberDetails?memIndex=C000230 In 1848, a candidate for Mayor of Chicago, James Hutchinson Woodworth, labelled himself an Independent Democrat to distance himself from what was at the time a corrupt and disorganized Chicago Democratic party organization; he preferred being described as an Independent Democrat rather than as a Whig as that party was itself experiencing a transition. He won election in his first campaign by an overwhelming majority and then was re-elected for a second term. However his Mayoral political success sealed his departure from any further association with the then Illinois Democratic party. When the Whigs in Illinois became the new Republican party, and he was able to confirm that his Abolitionist ideals would be recognized, he registered as a member of the GOP. He subsequently was elected to the United States House of Representatives from Illinois as a member of the GOP. Woodworth served one term in Congress, and return to a banking career in Chicago that spanned the Civil War era and the Reconstruction. Andrew Jackson Hamilton, in western Texas, was an Independent Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives, but did not run for re-election in 1860.

In November of that year he was elected as a Democrat to fill the vacancy created by his resignation. Thurmond later became a member of the Republican Party in 1964. Harry F. Byrd Jr., a senator from Virginia, left the Democratic Party in 1970. He continued to caucus with the Democrats and referred to himself as an Independent Democrat. Patrick Lucey was a Democrat who ran as an Independent as a vice- presidential candidate in 1980 with John B. Anderson. David Orr, who served as Mayor of Chicago briefly, entered politics as an Independent Democrat. In the 2006 primary, Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, a Democratic incumbent U.S. Senator, lost the Democratic nomination for that office to entrepreneur Ned Lamont by a 52% to 48% margin. Lieberman created a new party called the Connecticut for Lieberman Party, obtained its nomination for the seat on the basis of signed petitions, and ran in the general election in November as its candidate‚Äîone of five on the ballot in that race. He won with 49.7% of the votes cast for the office.\\"Vote for United States Senator ...

Throughout that Congress, he continued in that caucus (and it remained the majority caucus, with 51 or 50 members, complemented by the 49 or 48 Republicans caucusing together). , during the 111th Congress, Lieberman was annotated as \\"ID-CT\\" on the U.S. Senate's \\"contact information\\" web page for him, and with \\"Independent\\" in the \\"Party\\" column (for both the 110th and 111th Congresses) on Congress's \\"Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress\\"Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress ; specify \\"lieberman\\" in \\"Last Name\\" field page for him. Four members of the New York State Senate, Jeffrey Klein, Diane Savino, David Valesky, and David Carlucci, indicated they would form a similarly designated caucus separate from the Democratic conference in 2011, known as the Independent Democratic Conference. Following the 2009 New York State Senate Leadership Crisis the IDC formed a coalition government with then New York Senate Republican leader Dean Skelos to give Republicans control of the New York State Senate. In April 2018 the IDC announced they would dissolve and following the primary defeat of six of the eight members in the 2018 election the chamber returned to Democratic control in 2019. The two Independent Senators, Bernie Sanders and Angus King, caucus with the Democrats, are thus also considered as Independent Democrats.

The game was never ported to home systems. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot The game is set around the time of World War I, where the player maneuvers biplanes, automobiles, animals, and various other unidentifiable objects to battle an army of mech-wielding scientists. The player uses the 8-way joystick to control the biplane's movements, and the 2 buttons to shoot or hook enemies. The biggest characteristic of the player's biplane is the hook attached to its rear section. The hook is also controlled by the joystick, and enemies or objects that come in contact with the hook are dragged along by the plane. Dragged objects cause damage to anything they collide with, and the player can release the objects on the hook by pressing the hook button again. Dragged objects are destroyed when the player releases them from the hook, or if they collide enough times to break apart. The ship's power gauge increases when the player taps the shot button rapidly, and filling up the gauge causes the plane to shoot a bolt of lightning that covers a large area of the screen. However, the plane overheats if the player taps the shot button too many times, so this attack must be used sparingly. The game's graphics are highly detailed, and many of the backgrounds are likened to European towns and cities or World's fair-like scenes. Many of the game's background objects can also be destroyed or dragged around with the hook. Vehicles Though the player's main vehicle is the biplane, they can still continue on foot if their plane is shot down. The player can attack with a handgun while on foot, and can also ride various vehicles found along the way to make the progress easier. The vehicles include various animals such as giraffes, elephants, and horses, pogo sticks, bicycles, motorcycles, jeeps, and several types of robots that can hop and shoot missiles. Though the biplane is by far the most effective unit in terms of game completion, the presence of the ground units adds another layer of amusement to the game. Rohga: Armor Force was developed and released in Japan by Data East a year prior to Boogie Wings, and the vehicles in Boogie Wings were derived from the gameplay in Rohga: Armor Force, where the player could continue on foot even after their robot was destroyed.

Mining career Noah Timmins partnered with his older brother Henry in 1903 to buy into the La Rose silver claim in Cobalt, Ontario at the onset of the Cobalt silver rush. Fred La Rose, a blacksmith, while working for brothers Duncan and John McMartin in the construction of the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway (T&NO;) at Mile 103 from North Bay, Ontario, where he had built a small cabin, there chanced upon Erythrite, often an indication of associated cobalt and native silver. (A fanciful story later developed that La Rose discovered the vein when he threw a hammer at a pesky fox.) Noah subsequently heard of the claim from La Rose, who, at the end of his contract, had stopped at the Timmins brothers' general store in Mattawa, while returning to his home in Hull, Quebec. Noah cabled Henry, who was in Montreal, and immediately set out for Hull, where he met with La Rose and offered him $3,500 for a quarter share of the claim, effectively partnering with the McMartin brothers. The foursome soon added a friend of the Timmins brothers, attorney (1863-1924), for whom the David Dunlap Observatory was named, as a full fifth partner after he had successfully defended their claim in a \\"nasty dispute\\" with then former Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway Commissioner M.

Operated by the YMCA, it was founded in 1913 as a summer camp on the shores of Old Lake Barlow. The camp is at least . There are two main parts of camp - Day Camp and Main Camp - that are separated by Briggs Road. Camp programs The camp has multiple camping programs for different age groups and special interests that can be divided into two main sections: Overnight Camp (includes programs such as Teen Camp, Skate Camp, Horse Camp, Water Sports Camp, etc.) and Day Camp (includes Teen Camp and Kindercamp). During the fall, winter, and spring, Camp Manitou-Lin is also active with outdoor education, family camps, break camps, and special retreats. Horse camps The Horse Camp program is directed out of Camp Manitou-Lin's riding center, SPIRIT Farms Riding Center. There are at least 48 horses and seven farm animals. All horse camps ride twice a day, once after breakfast, and once before dinner. A camper is assigned to a riding group with 6-8 people, and then to a horse in a riding arena, where the whole group rides. After one camp week (five days), all of the riding groups put on separate horse shows, which includes a cook-out. The horse camps also have off-riding lessons, known as barn lessons, where they learn colors, markings, grooming, sickness and diseases, and horse parts. There are three arenas: the Red (largest), the Blue (second largest), and the Green Arena (smallest). The Red Arena is for more experienced riders, the Blue Arena is for riders with some experience, and the Green Arena is for non-experienced riders. =Horses= There are at least 48 horses. The largest, Rex, is a Belgian Draft Horse. There was one pair of Clydesdales: Penny and Polly. King and Queen are Belgian Draft Horses. The two newest horses are ponies named Princess and Johnny Cash. The camp has only one Tennessee Walking Horse, Toronado. Most of the horses are Arabians and Thoroughbreds. Main camp At the Main Camp, there are 18 cabins (all named after American Indian tribes), the Cheff Lodge (including offices, the camp store, the dining room, kitchen, and multipurpose \\"Blue Room\\"), and one infirmary. The main camp's attractions include indoor and outdoor rock climbing walls, a low ropes/teambuilding course (\\"Monkey Village\\"), a high ropes course, the A-field (a grassy athletic field used for camp games), an archery range, a rock-throwing range, the Pioneer Cabin, one of four platform tents on camp, a bathhouse, two designated campfire areas with bench seating, the Liesveld Pavilion, an extensive Nature Trail, an arts and crafts building, and a nature center (which houses birds, snakes, lizards, turtles, frogs, ferrets, rats, and rabbits, among other animals). The North Beach features a swimming area for overnight campers with floating F-dock and water slide, a boathouse, kayaking, canoeing, sailing, and inflatable water climbing toys. The South Beach features a swimming area for day campers. All cabins are carpeted and include indoor bathroom and shower facilities. There are six standalone cabins, each with their own bathroom; one double cabin (connected by an annex) with a bathroom on each side; two cabins connected on either side of the Director's office; and two quad cabins: North Quad and South Quad. North Quad is handicap accessible, can accommodate 48 individuals, and includes one bathroom. South Quad has room for 32 individuals on each side of the building (64 people total), and includes one bathroom on both sides of the building. South Quad also features a walk-out basement with two classrooms/meeting rooms, a kitchen, and two restrooms. Also found on Main Camp is the Gates Chapel, a covered outdoor chapel that can seat over 200 guests. Day camp The Day Camp area is located on the opposite side of Briggs Road, and is home to the Day Camp and Horse Camp programs. This section includes a large amount of land that is unused/undeveloped for camp purposes. Three of the four platform tents used for \\"camp-outs\\" are located on this side of the road. Day Camp is centered around a large enclosed pavilion. This building includes restrooms, offices, and storage space, but half of the pavilion is open for activities. The Day Camp area also includes a large fenced play area, a small chapel, the Children's Garden (where campers learn about various plants and insects), a soccer field, and a three-sided outdoor rock-climbing tower with zip line. Core values and motto At the camp, there are five core values to follow - Respect, Honesty, Caring, Inclusion, and Responsibility. Any camper who shows all of these five values plus more will be awarded by the staff at the Farewell campfire with a Spirit Stick commemorating their successes. Their motto is \\"God first, the other guy second, and I'm third.\\" Camp life Campers at Manitou-Lin are treated to a traditional summer overnight camp experience: twice-weekly campfires (complete with traditional camp songs), daily chapel meetings (each day's skit and/or songs focuses on one of the YMCA's Core Values), family-style dining at meal times, and healthy competition for each week's Battle for the Paddle (an award given at the end of each week to the most enthusiastic, spirited, actively involved cabin).

Hampshire County Group Insurance Trust The Hampshire Councilors served as the trustees of the Hampshire County Group Insurance Trust, a cooperative effort to provide health and life insurance for 68 governmental units - of which twenty-six are public employers in Hampshire County, thirty-six in Franklin County, three in Hampden County, and three in Worcester County. The Insurance Trust served approximately 10,000 employees and their dependents. Hampshire Power and Community Choice Electricity Aggregation The council had two programs providing low-cost electricity to customers in Western Massachusetts. Hampshire Power serves eighty town governments, school districts, and fire and water districts in Berkshire, Franklin, Hampden, Hampshire, and Worcester Counties. As of August 2012, customers have saved over $1.6 million on their bills. In addition, Hampshire Power serves one state agency, plus several non-profits and businesses. The Hampshire Council filed petitions for Municipal Aggregation of Electricity on behalf of 35 communities in Berkshire, Franklin, Hampden, Hampshire, and Worcester Counties. After approval by state regulators, the council would arrange supply for those customers who have not chosen an independent supplier in the communities. These included Great Barrington in Berkshire County; Hampden in Hampden County; thirteen participating communities in Hampshire County including Chesterfield, Cummington, Goshen, Granby, Hadley, Hatfield, Huntington, Middlefield, Northampton, Pelham, Plainfield, Westhampton, and Williamsburg; twelve Franklin County participating towns including Charlemont, Conway, Deerfield, Gill, Heath, Leverett, Montague, Northfield, Rowe, Warwick, Wendell, and Whately; and eight Worcester County participating towns: Barre, Brookfield, East Brookfield, Mendon, New Braintree, North Brookfield, Upton, and West Brookfield. In addition to these 35 communities, other towns and cities working to complete the initial process, included Egremont and Washington in Berkshire County; Bernardston and Orange in Franklin County; Blandford, Holland, Ludlow, Monson, and Montgomery in Hampden County; and Athol, Berlin, Charlton, Hardwick, Leicester, Millville, and Oxford in Worcester County. Altogether, the 51 communities had a combined population of over 230,000 people. Regional Services The Regional Services Department developed regional approaches to problems shared by Hampshire County municipalities, including securing surplus federal equipment. Regional Services oversaw the Hampshire Inspection Program that provided building inspection and zoning enforcement services. The department produced a wage and salary survey of all municipal positions in Hampshire County. Health Programs The council was involved in tobacco prevention efforts through the Tobacco Free Network serving both Franklin and Hampshire Counties. Funding for this program was provided by a grant from the Department of Public Health. As an integral part of the Hampshire County Group Insurance Trust, the Hampshire Council ran a Wellness Initiative. Other Programs In addition to the various departments, programs, and services, the Councilors attended monthly Full Board Meetings as well as Standing Committee Meetings, including the Executive Committee, Human Services Municipal Advisory Committee, Legislative, Charter & Code Committee, Regional Services Municipal Advisory Committee, Electric Committee, and Finance Committee. Each Committee had oversight of specific departments and programs and continues to look for ways to increase revenue and provide services. The Executive Committee was responsible for the more routine activities of the council and its various departments, oversees the carrying out of the policies voted by the Councilors and the duties of the Council Administrator, reviewed the proposed budget, acted as the Road Viewing and Hearing Committee, and served as the Real Estate Tax Appeal Board. The Human Services Committee was responsible for all health-related programs. The Legislative, Charter & Code Committee was generally responsible for the council's interest in all matters primarily concerned with State legislation. The committee was also entrusted with making recommendations to the Full Council for proposed amendments to the Council Charter and to review the Administrative Code. The Regional Services Committee served as liaison with the Hampshire County Fire Defense Association, and provided general supervision of the Regional Services and Cooperative Purchasing Departments. The committee was, towards the end of its operations, attempting to increase its exposure and advertising outreach. The Electricity Committee pursued cost- saving energy supply for Hampshire County municipalities, residents, businesses, and non-profits.

Consisting of 20 performers, 10 male and 10 female, they were founded by Janie Thompson in 1969. Since their first international performance at the 1970 World Fair in Osaka, Japan, they have performed in over 68 countries. History Ernest L. Wilkinson, then president of BYU, asked Janie Thompson, who had just returned from a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), to found the Program Bureau in 1952. She accepted Wilkinson's request, though she had to reject an offer from the Ike Carpenter band. BYU was invited to send a group to represent the United States at the 1970 World Fair in Osaka, Japan. Assisted by Harry Schultz, Thompson had created a performing group in 1969 called the Brigham Young Ambassadors. \\"Brigham\\" was dropped from the name in 1970 and the group became known as Young Ambassadors. Randy Boothe, the current director of the group, was recruited for the show. The audience received the group well and the Young Ambassadors continued to receive invitations to perform in front of international audiences. Before a tour, group members study the language and culture of the countries they tour so they can better interact with the people in the country. Since their first international performance at world exposition 1970 in Osaka, Japan, they have performed their musical variety show throughout the United States and over 68 other nations. Their audiences have included the prime minister of India, the queen of Thailand, and the king and queen of Jordan. Live and televised appearances in major concert halls and impromptu performances in hospitals, orphanages, town squares and government palaces reach millions of people each year. The Young Ambassadors company consists of 20 performers (10 men and 10 women), a 10 piece show band (keyboard, drums, guitar and bass guitar, etc.) and technical personnel. The Young Ambassadors have been directed by Randy Boothe since 1978. Impact The Young Ambassadors were the first organized group to represent The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) or BYU in the Soviet Union. In a 1991 speech at BYU, Dallin H. Oaks discussed how the Young Ambassadors overcame the challenges of trying to perform in China in 1978. The challenges were due to the lack of diplomatic relations between China and the United States at the time and the fact that United States tourists were not welcome there. Oaks related the 1978 tour and subsequent tours of the Young Ambassadors to China as contributive to missionary work of LDS Church in China and around the world. Chinese nobility were impressed by the Young Ambassadors, and continued to let them perform in China, even when visits from other performing groups were cancelled. Along with Oaks, French scholar Pierre Vendassi agreed that the performances of the Young Ambassadors in Beijing and other Chinese cities helped establish a relationship between China and the LDS Church.

It stars Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy before they had become the comedy team of Laurel and Hardy. It was shot during February 1927 and released July 17, 1927, by Path√© Exchange. It was considered a lost film until the 1980s. Lobby card Plot The film starts with the loading of a ship called the Merry Maiden. Oliver is first mate on the ship and described as \\"a bully, the nastiest crew member, after the captain of course\\". He features a beard and a mustache, rather than his usual solitary mustache. Stan plays Willie Brisling a guy who is engaged to Nelly and they are in love. The captain leaves his ship, he sees Nelly and decides he wants her. Stan has a tattoo of a ship on his chest and shows it to the captain. The captain pours a jug of water down Stan's sweater and abducts Nelly. The captain takes Nelly to his ship and Stan sneaks on board to rescue her. Oliver starts to look for Stan. Stan decides to save Nelly his last hope is to get rid of the crew, one by one. Stan disguises himself as a loose woman. The crew begin to fall for his charms. Stan calls one of the crewmen over, he hits the crewman with a cosh and knocks him out. Then he throws the cosh at Oliver, who thinks the crewman threw the cosh. Oliver throws the crewman overboard, this is repeated until all of the crew are in the sea. Nelly is being harassed by the captain. The captain's wife appears at the ship. The Captain takes a fancy to Stan. The wife appears as Stan is sat in the captain's lap. The captain's wife takes a gun and goes to shoot her husband. Stan stops her and takes off his wig. Stan says \\"this was a test to see if you really love your husband\\". The captain and wife begin to make up. But then the captain indicates he's going to \\"deal with Stan later\\". Stan is peeved, he opens the door and Nelly appears. Stan indicates the captain has been up to no good with Nelly and that four other loose women have already gone. The captain's wife is furious, Stan gives her the gun back. Stan and Nelly leave. There is a gunshot in the room. The wife, still angry, sees Stan and Nelly through a porthole and shoots them. Stan and Nelly's clothes fall off revealing their underwear.  Cast   Production  The film marks the first appearance of Anita Garvin in a Laurel and Hardy picture; her involvement in the film was not known until the 1986 rediscovery. Deleted scenes from this film included actress Anna May Wong.  Lost film found  After its initial run in 1927 and particularly after talkies eclipsed silent films marketability, Why Girls Love Sailors went missing in the U.S. for nearly fifty years. Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise had a 16mm print, which French film critic Roland Lacourbe saw in 1971, and pronounced it mediocre.Skretvedt, Randy (1996). Laurel and Hardy: The Magic Behind the Movies. Beverly Hills, CA: Past Times Publishing. , p. 81. When it was finally published, it was drawn from a 16mm print in a private collection, and only due to the efforts of a private collector in Copenhagen. Laurel and Hardy author Glenn Mitchell is even less impressed by the film than was Lacourbe: \\"Why Girls Love Sailors is one of several instances where the status of a 'lost' film has been reduced by its rediscovery,\\" he writes.Mitchell, Glenn (1995).

PGH provides a more feasible method of gene location than whole-genome association experiments, which are expensive and time-consuming. PGH differs from common PGD methods such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for two primary reasons. First, rather than focusing on the genetic makeup of an embryo PGH compares the genome of affected and unaffected members of previous generations. This examination of generational variation then allows for a haplotype of genetic markers statistically associated with the target disease to be identified, rather than searching merely for a mutation. PGH is often used to reinforce other methods of genetic testing, and is considered more accurate than certain more common PGD methods because it has been found to reduce risk of misdiagnoses. Studies have found that misdiagnoses due to allele dropout (ADO), one of the most common causes of interpretation error, can be almost entirely eliminated through use of PGH.Coskun S, Qubbaj W. 2010. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis and selection. J. Reprod Stem Cell Biotechnol 1(1): 120-140. Further, in the case of mutation due to translocation, PGH is able to detect chromosome abnormality to its full extent by differentiating between embryos carrying balanced forms of a translocation versus those carrying the homologous normal chromosomes.Shamash J, Rienstein S, Wolf-Reznik H, Pras E, Dekel M, Litmanovitch T, Brengauz M, Goldman B, Yonath H, Dor J, Levron J, Aviram-Goldring A. Preimplantation genetic haplotyping a new application for diagnosis of translocation carrier‚Äôs embryos- preliminary observations of two robertsonian translocation carrier families. J Assist Reprod Genet (2011) 28:77‚Äì83. This is an advantage because PGD methods such as FISH are able to reveal whether an embryo will express the phenotypic difference, but not whether an embryo may be a carrier.Altarescu G, Zeevi DA, Zeligson S, Perlberg S, Eldar-Geva T, Margalioth EJ, Levy-Lahad E, Renbaum P. Familial haplotyping and embryo analysis for Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) microarrays: a proof of principle study. J Assist Reprod Genet (2013) 30:1595‚Äì1603. In 2015, PGH was used in conjunction with a whole-genome amplification (WGA) process to not only diagnose disease but also distinguish meiotic segregation errors from mitotic ones.NewsRx. 2015. Genetics; Studies from Sanger Institute in the Area of Human Genetics Reported (Concurrent Whole-Genome Haplotyping and Copy-Number Profiling of Single Cells). Atlanta (GA): Life Science Weekly. Studies are being continually performed in an attempt to utilize and improve PGD methods since their initial invention. It has become increasingly popular because it grants individuals the option of detecting embryo abnormalities before implantation, rather than during the beginning weeks of pregnancy. The latter often results in embryo abortion, presenting an ethical dilemma for many that can now be avoided.  Procedure  PGH uses information regarding family history in conjunction with the use of linked polymorphic markers such as short tandem repeats (STRs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to locate genes responsible for disease. Both STRs and SNPs are variations in gene nucleotides, and it is estimated that there are tens of millions of each type of variation in human DNA. High frequency of STRs or SNPs in alleles of affected individuals in comparison to their unaffected direct relatives indicates the origin of a disease causing mutation. They thus \\"mark\\" alleles as having a mutation without having to specifically identify the mutation. Because the number of potential STRs and SNPs is so high, a family pedigree helps to narrow the scope of alleles to analyze. Further, understanding how the gene of interest gets expressed over time helps ultimately determine which haplotype is responsible for the alleles linked to the mutation. A haplotype map is thus created, not only exhibiting genes the offspring will contain, but also the parental origin of the genes. Once the alleles that correlate with a mutation are characterized, PGH of the embryos is possible and only embryos carrying the low risk haplotypes are selected for transfer. PGH is performed in vitro until this point, when the chosen embryos get placed in the uterus of a surrogate mother for further development.  Advantages  Once a panel of associated genetic markers has been established for a particular disease it can be used for all carriers of that disease. In contrast, since even a monogenic disease can be caused by many different mutations within the affected gene, conventional PGD methods based on finding a specific mutation would require mutation-specific tests. Thus, PGH widens the availability of PGD to cases where mutation-specific tests are unavailable. PGH also has an advantage over fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in that FISH is not usually able to make the differentiation between embryos that possess the balanced form of a chromosomal translocation and those carrying the homologous normal chromosomes. This inability can be seriously harmful to the diagnosis made. PGH can make the distinction that FISH often cannot. PGH does this by using polymorphic markers that are better suited at recognizing translocations. These polymorphic markers are able to distinguish between embryos that carried normal, balanced, and unbalanced translocations. FISH also requires more cell fixation for analysis whereas PGH requires only transfer of cells into polymerase chain reaction tubes. The cell transfer is a simpler method and leaves less room for analysis failure.Shamash, J. et al. (2011). Preimplantation genetic haplotyping a new application for diagnosis of translocation carrier‚Äôs embryos ‚Äì preliminary observations of two robertsonian trans-location carrier families. Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics, 28(1), 77-83.  Uses  PGH has been used to screen for: * Cystic fibrosis * Duchenne muscular dystrophy * Huntington's disease * Spinal muscular atrophy * Alport's syndrome * Von Hippel‚ÄìLindau disease * Sickle-cell disease * Hydatidiform mole History While PGD was initially carried out to sex rabbits in 1968, human PGD only became available after the development of PCR on a single cell DNA in 1985. PGH was first developed in 2006 at London's Guy's Hospital.

They are crepuscular or diurnal predators of other flying insects, and have large bulging eyes and strongly knobbed antennae. Description Owlflies are readily distinguished from dragonflies by their long, clubbed antennae; the latter have short, bristle-like antennae. The closely related antlions (family Myrmeleontidae) have short, weakly clubbed antennae, smaller eyes, and different wing venation. All but one species of Ascalaphidae have long antennae, easily distinguishing them. The sole exception is the Brazilian Albardia furcata, the only living member of the subfamily Albardiinae, which has short antennae, but these are strongly clubbed (compared to myrmeleontids), and its wing venation is reticulate, typical of ascalaphids. Most owlflies are about 1.5 inches in length, not including antennae. Adult Ululodinae such as Ululodes have large divided eyes and crepuscular habits, which is where the common name \\"owlfly\\" came from. Owlflies are worldwide in distribution, occurring in temperate and tropical habitats. Ecology mimicking a broken twig. Adult owlflies are fast-flying, aerial predators, capturing and feeding on other insects in flight. Adults of many New World species are most active at sunset, and can often be collected near lights. During the day, adults rest on stems and twigs with the body, legs, and antennae pressed to the stem. Some Old World species, such as Libelloides macaronius, are active during the day, and are brightly colored; many of them also hold their wings spread at rest like dragonflies. =Anti-predator defences= The abdomen in many crepuscular species is raised at rest, mimicking a broken twig. When disturbed, some owlflies release a strong, musk- like chemical to deter enemies. Some New World species such as ' are able to suddenly reflex a flap on the pronotum, exposing a strongly-contrasting patch of pale colour (white or cream), either as a deimatic display to startle predators, or as heliographic signalling to attract females. Life cycle Brood of first instar larvae on their egg-cases before dispersing Larva Eggs are laid on twigs or plant stems. Owlfly larvae are ambush predators, and sequester themselves at the soil surface, in ground litter, or on vegetation, sometimes covered with debris, and wait for prey, which they seize with their large, toothed mandibles. They resemble antlion larvae, but have an elongate, sometimes finger-like appendage on the side of each segment called a scolus- like process. In some genera, larvae actively place sand and debris onto their dorsum as camouflage. Pupation occurs in a spheroidal silk cocoon in leaf litter or soil. Evolution Owlflies appear to have evolved from a common ancestor with Stilbopterygidae. These, in turn, evolved from a common ancestor with Palparidae, which evolved from a common ancestor with the true antlions, or Myrmeleontidae. =Fossil history= The owlflies are an ancient group, dating back to the mid-Mesozoic at least. A number of fossil owlflies and owlfly larvae have been found, often encased in amber. Most of these also cannot be placed in a particular subfamily. Most are known from the Oligocene; the Late Jurassic Mesascalaphus may be an entirely more basal member of the family, but it is now believed to be a member of Mesochrysopidae. Fossil owlfly genera incertae sedis include Ascaloptynx, Borgia, Mesascalaphus, Neadelphus, Prosuhpalacsa and Ricartus. Cratopteryx from the Early Cretaceous is probably a member of the Myrmeleontoidea; sometimes assigned to the Ascalaphidae, it is better considered incertae sedis. =Phylogeny= Total evidence analysis (several genes + morphology) in 2019 recovered Ascalaphidae as monophyletic and found evidence for five subfamilies: Albardiinae van der Weele, 1909; Ululodinae van der Weele, 1909; Haplogleniinae Newman, 1853; Melambrotinae Tjeder, 1992; and Ascalaphinae Lef√®bvre, 1842. This followed nuclear phylogenomic analysis in 2018, which recovered Ascalaphidae as a paraphyletic lineage within Myrmeleontidae; authors in that paper sunk Ascalaphidae into the Myrmeleontidae as subfamily Ascalaphinae, and reduced in rank its subfamilies to tribes. Molecular analysis in 2018 using mitochondrial rRNA and mitogenomic data also placed the Ascalaphidae as sister to the Myrmeleontidae as the most advanced groups within the Neuroptera. The fossil record has contributed to an understanding of the group's phylogeny.Engel, M. S. & Grimaldi, D.

The agency began as the Leake and Watts Orphan Asylum in Manhattan.\\"History\\" on the Leake and Watts Services website History John George Leake (1752‚Äì1827) was a New York lawyer who had no children or siblings. He died on June 2, 1827 at his home on Park Row in Manhattan. His estate, which included personal property valued at about $300,000 and real estate worth an additional $86,000, he left to Robert Watts, the son of his best friend John Watts, with the stipulation that Robert Watts change his name to \\"Robert Leake.\\" Watts made the change, but died a few months later, leaving no will. The Leake fortune would then have passed to his father, John Watts, but considering the circumstances Watts was uncomfortable with receiving the money. In the legal papers of John Leake was an unsigned and undated draft of a will in his handwriting, in which he left money to create a home for orphaned children, and assigned his friend, John Watts, to administer the home. Watts petitioned the court to put the money to this use. The Public Administrator of New York took charge of the estate, ruling that Leake had died intestate. After a court decision the cash was released to the orphanage but his real estate was kept by New York State. Originally located at Trinity Church, a new building for the orphanage at West 112th Street in Morningside Heights, Manhattan, was completed in 1843, designed by Ithiel Town and constructed by Samuel Thomson in the Greek revival style. The site of the orphanage was purchased in 1891 by Bishop Henry Codman Potter for the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, and the building was to be torn down. However, the building was preserved as part of the cathedral close, renovated in 2006, and is the oldest building still standing in Morningside Heights. In 2012, a 16 year old student named Corey Foster died at Leake and Watts while being restrained by the institutions staff after refusing to leave the basketball court. The institute's practices, which include solitary confinement and punitive restraints, have been criticized.

It is also known as the torsalo or American warble fly, though the warble fly is in the genus Hypoderma and not Dermatobia, and is a parasite on cattle and deer instead of humans. Dermatobia fly eggs have been shown to be vectored by over 40 species of mosquitoes and muscoid flies, as well as one species of tick; the female captures the mosquito and attaches its eggs to its body, then releases it. Either the eggs hatch while the mosquito is feeding and the larvae use the mosquito bite area as the entry point, or the eggs simply drop off the muscoid fly when it lands on the skin. The larvae develop inside the subcutaneous layers, and after about 8 weeks, they drop out to pupate for at least a week, typically in the soil. The adults are large flies resembling bumblebees. They are easily recognized because they lack mouthparts (as is true of other oestrid flies). This species is native to the Americas from southeastern Mexico (beginning in central Veracruz) to northern Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay, though it is not abundant enough (nor harmful enough) to ever attain true pest status. Normally the greatest risk they pose to humans is increasing the chances of infection due to creating an open wound for their breathing holes. Some cases have also been reported in Europe. Since the fly larvae can survive the entire 8-week development only if the wound does not become infected, patients rarely experience infections unless they kill the larva without removing it completely. mouthparts. Remedies The easiest and most effective way to remove botfly larvae is to apply petroleum jelly over the location, which prevents air from reaching the larva, suffocating it. It can then be removed with tweezers safely after a day. White glue mixed with pyrethrin or other safe insecticides and applied to the spot of swelling on the scalp will kill the larvae within hours, as they must keep an air hole open, so will chew through the dried glue to do this, consuming the insecticide in the process. Venom extractor syringes can remove larvae with ease at any stage of growth. As these devices are a common component of first-aid kits, this is an effective and easily accessible remedy. A larva has also been successfully removed by first applying several coats of nail polish to the area of the larva's entrance, weakening it by partial asphyxiation. Covering the location with adhesive tape would also result in partial asphyxiation and weakening of the larva, but is not recommended because the larva's breathing tube is fragile and would be broken during the removal of the tape, leaving most of the larva behind. Oral use of ivermectin, an antiparasitic avermectin medicine, has proved to be an effective and noninvasive treatment that leads to the spontaneous emigration of the larva. This is especially important for cases where the larva is located at inaccessible places like inside the inner canthus of the eye.

It currently has 4,610 enrolled students (3,470 undergraduate and 1,140 graduate) and over 150 faculty members.School History The school offers nine engineering degree programs.  History  The Schulich School of Engineering was originally conceived on September 28, 1964 at the first meeting of the Engineering Council, as the Faculty of Engineering. The new school was officially accredited and given faculty status on April 1, 1965 and officially opened its doors for the fall semester of the same year, with a total first year enrollment of 59 students, taught by two faculty members. Over the 40 years that the faculty has been operating, it has expanded drastically to its current size, as well as several new wings to the engineering building, now more accurately a complex, and an entirely new building to house the software, computer, and electrical engineering department. Before the 2005-2006 fall and winter semesters, Seymour Schulich made a $25 million donation to the faculty, which was matched by another $25 million from the Alberta provincial government. At this point, the name of the faculty was changed to the Schulich School of Engineering in honour of his donation. Dr. Wirasinghe stepped down as dean of the school on June 30, 2006. Dr. M. Elizabeth Cannon, the former head of the geomatics engineering department, assumed the position of dean on July 1, 2006. Dr. Cannon was appointed to be the president of the University of Calgary on 1 July 2010 and her previous position as dean is now held by Dr. Bill Rosehart. In 1993, the School started an internship program with Dr. Michael Ward, former civil department head and the vice-president of research of the University, as the founding director. Schulich School of Engineering now has one of the largest engineering internship programs in the country. Approximately 70% of Schulich engineering students go through the optional internship program.  Buildings  The Schulich School of Engineering is located in the northern section of the University of Calgary campus in a complex that consists of four main buildings. = Main Complex = The first main engineering building houses all of the departments with the exception of the Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering and the Department of Electrical, Computer and Software Engineering (housed in separate buildings). The building is composed of seven blocks listed as Engineering A - G. The majority of engineering specific courses are also held in the lecture halls within this building. Other notable facilities in the main building include the Machine Shop, the M.A. Ward Civil Engineering Labs, the Engineering Students Society office, and the \\"Engg Lounge\\". As many of the first year engineering courses (which are identical for all departments) take place here, a principal hallway in this building is often referred to as \\"The First Year Hole\\".  Canadian Natural Resources Limited Engineering Complex  The Canadian Natural Resources Limited Engineering Complex is the newest addition to the main engineering complex. Officially opened to the public in November 2016 (it had been used for classes and labs since September 2016), the CNRL complex is a $174 million building meant to increase enrollment capacity in the engineering department by 400 seats and to provide new classroom and lecture hall facilities. The building was named in honour Canadian Natural Resources Limited for the company's $7 million donation, the largest single donation the University of Calgary has received to date. The building is 18,300 square meters and provides classrooms and undergraduate design labs on the bottom two floors. On the upper floors, new research labs will be used to support research in clean energy technology and renewable energy sources.https://schulich.ucalgary.ca/news/canadian-natural-resources- limited-engineering-complex-facts  Machine Shop  The machine shop in the Schulich School of Engineering came into existence with the school in 1966, and provides a variety of mechanical construction services to the students and faculty members. The shop provides a variety of services, including CNC machining, manual machining, fabrication, and carpentry.  M.A. Ward Civil Engineering Labs  The civil engineering laboratory is located in a cavernous space in the south-westernmost block of the main complex. It is the main experimental space for the civil engineering faculty (along with the bay in CCIT) and can supports many separate endeavours at one time. While it is generally closed off to the main student body, there are always viewing windows on the second floor.  Engineering Students Society Office  The Engineering Students Society (ESS) is a non-profit organization that is run by students within the faculty to provide student activities, academic help and student-professional interaction. It is a member of the Canadian Federation of Engineering Students and sends representatives to various conferences and meets throughout the country. At the office, students can purchase books containing past exams for their classes, laboratory notebooks, T-shirts, sweatshirts, and tickets for events run by the different student organizations within engineering.  The Engg Lounge  The Engineering Student Lounge is the central social gathering area at the Schulich School of Engineering. During the fall and winter semesters, especially at 12:00 PM, the lounge is normally a hive of activity, as a vast majority of students come by to socialize and eat. The lounge is also notable for P.O.E.T.S, or Piss On Everything, Tomorrow's Saturday, a weekly Friday gathering of engineers (Beginning at 3:00pm, and ending at 6:00pm), originally created by Dean Rhodes and put on by the Engineering Students Society. P.O.E.T.S is a place for engineering students (and even sometimes professors!) to unwind at the end of the school week and enjoy \\"cheaper\\" cold beer and occasionally live music, as well as a weekly event such as Minnow Races, Jeopardy, Engg Olympics, etc. = Information Communications Technology Building = The ICT building is shared by the Schulich School of Engineering with the Department of Computer Science from the Faculty of Science. The building houses the majority of the Department of Electrical, Computer, and Software Engineering in the form of several lecture halls, computer labs and electronics labs. The ground level of ICT is arranged as a food court themed meeting area, frequented by many faculties. Commercial services such as Family Mart, Good Earth Cafe and Apex Credit Union occupy the bottom floor. Electronics Labs The ICT building features ultramodern electronics labs for electrical and computer engineering students. These include labs for second and third year students, and the Telus Microwave Research Laboratory for microwave antenna design and research. = Mechanical Engineering Building (Petro Canada Building) = The Mechanical Engineering building houses the Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing at the Schulich School of Engineering. It was donated to the faculty of engineering by Petro-Canada. Unlike the rest of the engineering faculty, it is not physically connected but in fact resides in a separate building across 32nd Ave. NW. in the university's research park. It contains many labs and offices for faculty and grad students, as well as the mechanical engineering shop. It also functions as the headquarters for the University of Calgary's Formula SAE and Baja SAE racecar teams. The mechanical engineering department at the U of C is one of the largest in Canada with around 150 graduate students and 350 undergraduates. The buildings contains three computer labs with over 40 computers in total, a study room which seats approximately 8 students, and a newly renovated recreation room, complete with two Foosball tables, that seats approximately 12 students.  Mechanical Engineering Shop  The MES is located at the easternmost end of the ME building and contains a variety of tools and equipment for building and testing research projects in the mechanical engineering department. As of 2010, the mechanical engineering shop has been severely downsized with a reduction in staff and equipment. Various labs for the mechanical department are held here such as doing tests on a four-cylinder Toyota engine. = Energy, Environment, & Experiential Learning Building (EEEL) = Though primarily used by the Faculty of Science, the EEEL building hosts a few lab facilities and the Dean's Office for the engineering department. Located just north of the ICT Building, EEEL contains many lab facilities and lecture halls along with office space on the upper floors and a coffee shop on the main floor. Due to construction of the CNRL complex, the Dean's Office was moved to the fourth floor of the EEEL building.

In 1984 the new Green Party prepared to enter into a German state government for the first time in its history. The first Green cabinet minister in German history was going to be Joschka Fischer who later became minister of Foreign Affairs in the German Federal Government under Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der. The 1984 Hesse coalition under minister-president Holger B√∂rner was to be based on an official policy agreement negotiated by both parties. In this agreement it is stated: \\"Die F√§lle der Koppelung von Arbeits- und Aufenthaltserlaubnis werden √ºbereinstimmend als erledigt betrachtet (Shanghaier Kugelfischabkommen vom 3.11.1974).\\" (page 108, section 2.4; engl. \\"The cases of coupling work and residence permits are considered to be resolved (Shanghai Fugu Agreement of 3.11.1974).\\") Later, the Green party provided an explanation how this text found its way into the official document: During a final night session of the negotiations the Greens presented a demand that Hesse join the \\"Shanghai Fugu Agreement\\". This was accepted by their tired Social Democratic counterparts and became official state policy. The Greens argued that the fugu fish were well known to be a dangerous delicacy requiring specialized chefs who mostly came from Asia. Due to expanding restrictions on work permits restaurants had found it difficult to employ such specialists. The \\"Shanghai Fugu Agreement\\" was supposed to provide special regulations for certified fugu chefs internationally. It is actually true that chefs in Japan must have certification to handle the fish. However, the agreement was absolutely fictional, as fugu is not served in Germany at all. However, neither was it discovered to be a joke by the Social Democrats during the nightly negotiations, nor later by civil servants or the press who went through the coalition contracts. It took years before the Agreement was revealed to be a joke.

Robert Oppenheimer, whom he met at Berkeley, California in 1937. Oppenheimer's relationship with Chevalier, and Chevalier's relationship with a possible recruiter for Soviet intelligence, figured prominently in a 1954 hearing of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission on Oppenheimer's security clearance. At that hearing, Oppenheimer's security clearance was revoked. Early life Chevalier was born September 10, 1901 in Lakewood Township, New Jersey to French and Norwegian parents.Haakon Maurice Chevailer, Federal Bureau of Investigation. Accessed February 9, 2011. \\"Haakon Maurice Chevalier was born on September 10, 1901, at Lakewood, New Jersey.\\" When he was in his twenties he felt attracted by the romantic aspects of seafaring and embarked as a deckhand on one of the last commercial sailing ships, the four-masted US schooner Rosamond for a voyage to the southern ocean and Cape Town. He left a vivid and nostalgic testimony of this very end of the age of sail in his book The Last Voyage of the Schooner Rosamond. Work In 1945, Chevalier served as a translator for the Nuremberg Trials. He translated many works by Salvador Dal√≠, Andr√© Malraux, Vladimir Pozner, Louis Aragon, Frantz Fanon and Victor Vasarely into English. Relationship with Oppenheimer Chevalier met Oppenheimer in 1937 at Berkeley while he was an associate professor of Romance languages. Together, Chevalier and Oppenheimer would found the Berkeley branch of a teachers' union, which sponsored benefits for leftist causes.Broad, 2002. Chevalier approached Oppenheimer in 1942 seeking information about nuclear power for the Soviet Union on behalf of George Eltenton. This encounter, and Oppenheimer's belated reporting of it and attempts to obscure the identity of Chevalier, would later become one of the key issues in Oppenheimer's security hearings in front of the Atomic Energy Commission in 1954 which resulted in the revocation of his security clearance.Strauss, Lewis L., Zuckert, Eugene M., and Campbell, Joseph. 1954, June 29. \\"Decision and Opinions of the United States Atomic Energy Commission in the Matter of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer\\". Avalon Project At Yale Law School. Chevalier is interviewed in The Day After Trinity (1981), an Oscar- nominated documentary about Oppenheimer and the atomic bomb. Later life and death After the House Subcommittee on Un-American Activities hearing, Chevalier lost his job at Berkeley in 1950 and was unable to find another professorship in the United States and thus moved to France, where he continued to work as a translator. Chevalier returned to the United States briefly in July 1965 to attend his daughter's wedding in San Francisco.Federal Bureau of Investigation. FOIA Index for Haakon Chevalier.

It is an association for professional wrestlers who possess superhuman strength, endurance and resistance to injury.  Overview  The UCWF was founded by a promoter named Edward Garner after a wrestler who he managed was banned from several existing professional wrestling organizations because he possessed superhuman strength. The UCWF is organized into \\"weight divisions\\"... not based on the wrestler's body weight, but on how much tonnage he can lift. The lowest division (for those with the strength to lift (press) two to ten tons) was phased out early in the Federation's history as not being \\"spectacular\\" enough. Numerous superhuman individuals have fought in the UCWF at one time or another, including both those recognized as superheroes and supervillains. Prominent members have included The Thing, Justice (then known as Marvel Boy), and Demolition Man. The ranks of the UCWF have also included mutants, aliens, members of the Eternals (like Ikaris) and the Deviants, and many of the other varieties of super-strong beings from throughout the Marvel Universe. By far the most common participants, however, have been those who have undergone the strength-augmenting treatment of the Power Broker, a quasi-legal corporation run by Curtiss Jackson that uses the fruits of the many mad scientists populating the Marvel universe. The process is somewhat risky, however, and many wind up deformed or with severe health problems as a result. Also, the Power Broker organization is not without its corruption; at times, they not only augment their clients, but inject them with highly addictive drugs in order to control them. As a result, many of the Unlimited Class wrestlers also find themselves moonlighting as supervillains. The Power Broker has also played a significant role in the lives of other villains and heroes, particularly the U.S. Agent. After appointing a new general manager, Jim Jay McMayhew, UCWF is shown to become a more scripted sports entertainment version of itself much to the disappointment of former champion Ben Grimm.

Between 1938 and 1985 his enthusiasm and a memorable turn of phrase endeared him to many. He is still regarded as the original 'voice of Gaelic games'. Early life O'Hehir was born in Glasnevin, Dublin to parents who had moved from Clare. His father, Jim O'Hehir, was active in Gaelic games, having trained his native county to win the 1914 All-Ireland title in hurling. He subsequently trained the Leitrim football team that secured the Connacht title in 1927 and he also served as an official with the Dublin Junior Board. O'Hehir was educated at St. Patrick's National School in Drumcondra before later attending the O'Connell School. He later studied electrical engineering at University College Dublin, however, he abandoned his studies after just one year to pursue a full-time career in broadcasting. O'Hehir never played football, however, he enjoyed a distinguished hurling career with the St. Vincent's club in Raheny. Broadcasting career =Early career= O'Hehir became fascinated with the radio when he received a present of one as a child. He had just turned eighteen and was still a school-boy when he wrote to Radio √âireann asking to do a test commentary. O'Hehir was accepted and was asked, along with five others, to do a five-minute microphone test for a National Football League game between Wexford and Louth. His microphone test impressed the director of broadcasting so much that he was invited to commentate on the whole of the second half of the match. Two months later in August 1938 O'Hehir made his first broadcast - the All-Ireland football semi-final between Monaghan and Galway. He went on to commentate on the second semi-final and that year's final between Galway and Kerry. The following year he covered his first hurling final - the famous \\"thunder and lightning final\\" between Cork and Kilkenny. Sports broadcasting in Ireland was still in its infancy at this stage, however, O'Hehir's Sunday afternoon commentaries quickly became a way of life for many rural listeners. =The Polo Grounds Final= By the mid-1940s O'Hehir was recognised as one of Ireland's leading sports broadcasters. In 1947 he faced his most challenging broadcast to date when he had to commentate on the All-Ireland Football Final from the Polo Grounds in New York City. Over 1,000,000 people were listening to the broadcast back in Ireland and O'Hehir was the one link between the game in New York and the fans in Ireland. The broadcast had to be finished by five o'clock local time, however, the match ran late. The last few minutes of O'Hehir's commentary included him pleading with the broadcast technicians not to take him off the air. His pleas were successful and the Irish people were able to listen to the game in full. =Horse racing= In 1944 O'Hehir joined the staff of Independent Newspapers as a sports sub-editor, before beginning a seventeen- year career as racing correspondent in 1947. His racing expertise were not just limited to print journalism as he became a racing commentator with Radio √âireann in 1945. Even though O'Hehir's star was on the rise with the national broadcaster in Ireland, he applied to the BBC for a position as racing commentator. His application was accepted and he provided commentary for the Cheltenham Gold Cup. The BBC bosses were sufficiently impressed with O'Hehir to offer him further commentaries. O'Hehir subsequently became a staple of the BBC's coverage of the famous annual Grand National steeplechase. He would invariably pick up the commentary at the Becher's Brook fence and take the race to Valentine's Brook, a vital section of the race where many a favourite fell. Foinavon's famous victory in 1967 will be remembered as one of O'Hehir's finest moments in racing commentaries and won him great respect for the speed and smoothness with which he picked out the unconsidered outsider. O'Hehir later confessed in an interview that it had been his inability to identify the colours on his card when inspecting the riders silks in the weighing room prior to the race that had led him to question rider John Buckingham who his mount was. Buckingham advised O'Hehir that Foinavon's silks had been changed at the last minute as his regular green colours were considered unlucky. It was because of this chance meeting that he was able to identify the 100/1 outsider and carry the commentary. However, in the 1969 Grand National, O'Hehir made a horrendous error stating eventual winner Highland Wedding had fallen at Bechers Brook (2nd circuit), when it was a horse called Kilburn that actually fell. He only covered three TV Grand Nationals (1967, 1968 and 1969), afterwards he would continue to cover the race for BBC Radio until 1981. In addition to horseracing O'Hehir also covered showjumping, including the Dublin Horse Show at the RDS in Ballsbridge. =Head of Sport= In 1961 Ireland's first national television station, Telef√≠s √âireann, was founded and O'Hehir was appointed head of sports programmes. As a result of his influence O'Hehir secured the broadcasting rights to the closing stages of the All-Ireland hurling and football championships for the new station. As well as his new role O'Hehir continued to keep up a hectic schedule of commentaries. =Current affairs broadcasting= O'Hehir's skills did not just confine him to sports broadcasting and, in November 1963, he faced his toughest broadcast. By coincidence he was on holidays with his wife Molly in New York City when US President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. O'Hehir was asked by Telef√≠s √âireann to provide the commentary for the funeral. The live five-hour broadcast proved a huge challenge for him, as he had had no association with political or current affairs broadcasting up to that point and lacked the resources available to more established television stations. O'Hehir's commentary, however, won widespread acclaim in Ireland and showed a different side of his nature. He later described it as the most moving and most demanding commentary of his career. O'Hehir was known in the United States prior to this as he had worked with ABC as a racing commentator. His presentation of the Kennedy funeral brought offers from American broadcasters, however, he preferred to remain in Ireland. O'Hehir later provided commentaries for other non-sporting events such as the reburial of Roger Casement (who had been executed in 1916) in 1965 and the celebrations marking the golden jubilee of the Easter Rising in 1966. =Later career= In the early 1970s the initial challenge of being head of sport had faded as Telef√≠s √âireann was now an established broadcaster. In 1972 he became manager of the newly designed Leopardstown Racecourse but left the following year to continue writing and broadcasting as a freelance journalist. This work took him to the United States where he commentated for NBC in races such as the Arlington Million. This association with the American broadcaster lasted well into the eighties. In 1975 O'Hehir was honoured by The Late Late Show with a special tribute show. In the 1984 People of the Year Awards he was one of the winners. In his commentary O'Hehir aimed at impartiality but admitted that he was always blamed for being \\"against the losers.\\" Similarly he was also blamed for making a game out of nothing. Shortly after Dublin defeated Galway in 1983 in a tense All-Ireland final about thirty Dublin supporters attacked him in the commentary box when he was commentating at another match in Navan. Only the presence of an armed detective - there to protect the microphone - saved him from serious injury. =Illness and later life= In August 1985 O'Hehir was preparing to commentate on the All-Ireland hurling final between Offaly and Galway. It would be a special occasion as it would mark his 100th commentary on an All-Ireland final. Two weeks before the game he suffered a stroke which left him using a wheelchair and with some speaking difficulties. This illness denied him the chance to reach the century milestone. O'Hehir was subsequently replaced by Ger Canning on television, and on radio by M√≠che√°l √ì Muircheartaigh. He had hoped to return to broadcasting one day to complete his 100th final; however, this never happened. In 1987 the centenary All-Ireland football final took place and a special series of events was planned on the day at Croke Park. There was a parade of the 1947 Polo Grounds finalists; however, the biggest cheer of the day was reserved for O'Hehir who was pushed onto the field in a wheelchair by his son Peter. Nobody expected the standing ovation and the huge outpouring of emotion from the thousands of fans present and from O'Hehir himself. Over the next few years O'Hehir withdrew from public life. He returned briefly in 1996 when his autobiography, My Life and Times, was published. Death Michael O'Hehir died in Dublin on 24 November 1996. Centenary The centenary of his birth was on 2 June 2020. Quotes \\"And if there's anybody along the way there listening in, just give us five minutes more\\" - O'Hehir saving the 1947 Polo Grounds Final for all the Irish listeners \\"Ring in front of the goal is going through. He steadies himself, he takes a shot. It's blocked by Art Foley and it's cleared out by Art Foley. Oh, what a magnificent save there by Art Foley\\" - O'Hehir's description of Art Foley's famous save in the final moments of the 1956 hurling final \\"And Tom Cheasty breaks through with Kilkenny defenders falling around him like dying wasps\\" - during one of the Kilkenny - Waterford games of the late 1950s or early 1960s \\"And it looks like there‚Äôs a bit of a schemozzle in the parallelogram\\" - O'Hehir's ubiquitous euphemism for a fight \\"The greatest freak of all time\\" - after Mikey Sheehy lobs the ball into the goal while Dublin goalkeeper, Paddy Cullen is arguing with the referee \\"And it looks as if they were winning the way the Offaly men are just dithering and dawdling there...and here they come. This is Liam Connor the full-back...a high, lobbing, dropping ball in towards the goalmouth...a shot and a GOAL, a GOAL, a GOAL FOR OFFALY! There was a goal in the game! A goal. Oh, what a goal!\\" - O'Hehir's reaction as S√©amus Darby scores the winning goal for Offaly in the 1982 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final, denying Kerry a famous fifth consecutive All-Ireland title. \\"And the bare-footed wonder with the ball now\\" - O'Hehir's description of Babs Keating who played some of the 1971 All-Ireland Hurling Final in his bare feet \\"And there he is, Alan Lotty. He may be bootless, he may be sockless, he may be stickless, but he is certainly not ball-less.\\" - O'Hehir's unusual description of Cork's Alan Lotty after he discarded his boots and socks and lost his hurley in a collision with another player \\"And it is a penalty. And Paddy Cullen, heaven help him, in there in the goal\\" - during the 1974 all-Ireland football final. \\"And the Jacks are back alright and the way they're playing right now the Galway backs are jacked!\\" See also  * List of people on stamps of Ireland References * Category:1920 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Alumni of University College Dublin Category:Gaelic games commentators Category:Irish Independent people Category:Irish sports broadcasters Category:People educated at O'Connell School Category:People from Glasnevin Category:RT√â Radio 1 presenters Category:RT√â television presenters Category:St Vincents (Dublin) hurlers Category:GAA people from County Dublin Category:Sportspeople from County Dublin ","title":"Michael O'Hehir"},{"id":"5630691","text":"Joseph Thorarinn Thorson, (March 15, 1889 - July 6, 1978) was a lawyer and politician from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.

Evangelical Protestants in Albania numbered approximately 8,000 in 1998. The International Religious Freedom Report of 2007 reported 189 different Protestant associations and groups. Unlike other official religions in Albania, Evangelical Protestants are not organized under a hierarchy with an official head, but operate autonomously in separate churches or organizations bearing different denominational or non-denominational names. Most, but not all Evangelical/Protestant groups are members of the Albania's Evangelical Brotherhood (VUSH), a cooperative organization which views itself as existing as \\"an instrument of blessing ‚Ä¶ with the purpose of promoting unity amongst the churches, representing every local church with dignity, and promoting evangelism.\\"http://www.vush.org (official website) History On August 26, 1816, Robert Pinkerton wrote the British and Foreign and Bible Society to encourage them to translate the New Testament into Albanian.The Thirteenth Annual Report of the British and Foreign Bible Society, 1817, p. 93-94. Cyrus Hamlin reported in 1857 that Albanians were applying to his Protestant seminary.ABCFM Annual Report, 1857, Boston, p. 61. The first documented Albanian Protestant was Kostandin Kristoforidhi, who left his native Orthodox faith and converted to Protestantism on his own while comparing Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Protestant theological texts. He joined the Protestant Church of Smyrna in 1856 or 1857, and was sent to Istanbul for theological training. In Monastir, Gjerasim Qiriazi also converted to Protestantism ca. 1876‚Äì1877, and united with the multi-ethnic Protestant church there. The first two known Albanian Protestant-Evangelical churches were both established by Gjerasim Qiriazi, first in Monastir in 1884 and later in Kor√ßa in 1890 (both cities then part of the Ottoman Empire). In April 1890, Gjerasim Qiriazi was ordained as the first Albanian evangelist and preacher by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions in the board's annual meeting help in Monastir. The second church among Albanians was opened in Kor√ßa. Qiriazi was also the head of one of the first national societies within Albania, named ‚ÄúThe Evangelical Brotherhood‚Äù.

It has been moved a number of times in its history but the van is now permanently fixed on a masonry base. The caravan walls have been decorated with custom painted murals by Alan Puckett, a motoring art specialist. The inside walls of the cart are decorated with pictures and murals of famous visitors. The site is considered a Sydney icon and an institution in the local area. The significance of the location is reflected by its inclusion on the New South Wales National Trust register.

E:1991-present day. Note: Map shows current position of Cowper Wharf Road. The 1981-82 location was on the footpath of Cowper Wharf Road before the road was relocated further west in 1982. Harry \\"Tiger\\" Edwards opened the original caravan cafe, named simply Harry's, near the gates of the Woolloomooloo Naval Yard in 1938. He served with the Second Australian Imperial Force in World War II, during which time the cafe was not operational. The cart re-opened upon his return from the war in 1945. The name Cafe de Wheels came about because of the requirement from the city council that mobile food caravans had to move a minimum of 12 inches (30 cm) each day. The cart has been moved to various locations on Cowper Wharf Road, mostly due to re-development work in the Woolloomooloo Bay area. Local legend tells that the name was temporarily changed to Cafe de Axle at one point when the wheels were stolen. As the years passed, 'Harry's Cafe de Wheels' gained new fame as a tourist attraction. A visit to the caravan became a 'must' for visiting celebrities such as Frank Sinatra, Robert Mitchum and Marlene Dietrich. In 1974, Colonel Sanders stopped at Harry's and enjoyed the food so much that he ate three 'pies and peas' while leaning on his walking stick in front of the caravan. A picture of Sanders taken during the visit still hangs in the caravan today. Harry's specialises today in the same basic food that was popular back in the 1940s, such as pies and mushy peas. During the 1970s Harry's introduced hot dogs, mostly to appease the American sailors.

Paul's hometown of Neustettin, then part of Germany, became Polish territory after the Second World War and is now called Szczecinek. In 1910, Konrad married the painter Gertrud Kressner (1879 - 1974). They had a daughter Ortrud Knopp (1911 - 1976), with the grandchildren Willfried Spohn (1944 - 2012), Herbert Spohn (*1946) und Wolfgang Spohn (*1950), and a son Ingolf Knopp (1915 ‚Äì 2008), with the grandchildren Brigitte Knopp (*1952) and Werner Knopp (*1954). Konrad was primarily educated in Berlin, with a brief sojourn at the University of Lausanne in 1901 for a single semester, before settling at the University of Berlin, where he remained for his doctoral studies. His doctoral thesis, entitled Grenzwerte von Reihen bei der Ann√§herung an die Konvergenzgrenze, was supervised by Schottky and Frobenius; he received his PhD in 1907. Travels, teaching, and military career Knopp traveled widely in Asia, taking teaching jobs in Nagasaki, Japan (1908-9), at the commercial college, and in Qingdao, China (1910‚Äì11), at the German-Chinese college there, and spending some time in India and China following his stay in Japan. His wedding to Kressner, the daughter of Colonel Karl Kressner and Hedwig Rebling, took place in Germany between these periods. After Qingdao he returned to Germany for good and taught at military academies while writing his habilitation thesis for Berlin University. During the First World War he was an officer and was wounded at the beginning of the war, which resulted in his discharge from the army; by the autumn of 1914 he was teaching at Berlin University. In the following year he was appointed as an extraordinary professor at the University of K√∂nigsberg, becoming an ordinary professor there in 1919.

N-stage traveling-wave amplifier  History  The design of the distributed amplifiers was first formulated by William S. Percival in 1936.W. S. Percival, ‚ÄúThermionic Valve Circuits,‚Äù British Patent Specification no. 460,562, filed 24 July 1936, granted January 1937. In that year Percival proposed a design by which the transconductances of individual vacuum tubes could be added linearly without lumping their element capacitances at the input and output, thus arriving at a circuit that achieved a gain-bandwidth product greater than that of an individual tube. Percival's design did not gain widespread awareness however, until a publication on the subject was authored by Ginzton, Hewlett, Jasberg, and Noe in 1948. It is to this later paper that the term distributed amplifier can actually be traced. Traditionally, DA design architectures were realized using vacuum tube technology.  Current technology  More recently, III-V semiconductor technologies, such as GaAs and InP have been used. These have superior performance resulting from higher bandgaps (higher electron mobility), higher saturated electron velocity, higher breakdown voltages and higher-resistivity substrates. The latter contributes much to the availability of higher quality-factor (Q-factor or simply Q) integrated passive devices in the III-V semiconductor technologies. To meet the marketplace demands on cost, size, and power consumption of monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs), research continues in the development of mainstream digital bulk-CMOS processes for such purposes. The continuous scaling of feature sizes in current IC technologies has enabled microwave and mm-wave CMOS circuits to directly benefit from the resulting increased unity-gain frequencies of the scaled technology. This device scaling, along with the advanced process control available in today's technologies, has recently made it possible to reach a transition frequency (ft) of 170 GHz and a maximum oscillation frequency (fmax) of 240 GHz in a 90 nm CMOS process..  Theory of operation  The operation of the DA can perhaps be most easily understood when explained in terms of the traveling-wave tube amplifier (TWTA). The DA consists of a pair of transmission lines with characteristic impedances of Z0 independently connecting the inputs and outputs of several active devices. An RF signal is thus supplied to the section of transmission line connected to the input of the first device. As the input signal propagates down the input line, the individual devices respond to the forward traveling input step by inducing an amplified complementary forward traveling wave on the output line. This assumes the delays of the input and output lines are made equal through selection of propagation constants and lengths of the two lines and as such the output signals from each individual device sum in phase. Terminating resistors Zg and Zd are placed to minimize destructive reflections. The transconductive gain of each device is gm and the output impedance seen by each transistor is half the characteristic impedance of the transmission line. So that the overall voltage gain of the DA is: :Av = ¬Ω n¬∑gm¬∑Z0, where n is the number of stages. Neglecting losses, the gain demonstrates a linear dependence on the number of devices (stages). Unlike the multiplicative nature of a cascade of conventional amplifiers, the DA demonstrates an additive quality. It is this synergistic property of the DA architecture that makes it possible for it to provide gain at frequencies beyond that of the unity-gain frequency of the individual stages. In practice, the number of stages is limited by the diminishing input signal resulting from attenuation on the input line. Means of determining the optimal number of stages are discussed below. Bandwidth is typically limited by impedance mismatches brought about by frequency dependent device parasitics. The DA architecture introduces delay in order to achieve its broadband gain characteristics. This delay is a desired feature in the design of another distributive system called the distributed oscillator.  Lumped elements  Delay lines are made of lumped elements of L and C. The parasitic L and the C from the transistors are used for this and usually some L is added to raise the line impedance. Because of the Miller effect in the common source amplifier the input and the output transmission line are coupled. For example, for voltage inverting and current amplifying the input and the output form a shielded balanced line. The current is increasing in the output transmission line with every subsequent transistor, and therefore less and less L is added to keep the voltage constant and more and more extra C is added to keep the velocity constant. This C can come from parasitics of a second stage. These delay lines do not have a flat dispersion near their cut off, so it is important to use the same L-C periodicity in the input and the output. If inserting transmission lines, input and output will disperse away from each other. For a distributed amplifier the input is fed in series into the amplifiers and parallel out of them. To avoid losses in the input, no input signal is allowed to leak through. This is avoided by using a balanced input and output also known as push‚Äìpull amplifier. Then all signals which leak through the parasitic capacitances cancel. The output is combined in a delay line with decreasing impedance. For narrow band operation other methods of phase-matching are possible, which avoid feeding the signal through multiple coils and capacitors. This may be useful for power-amplifiers. The single amplifiers can be of any class. There may be some synergy between distributed class E/F amplifiers and some phase-matching methods. Only the fundamental frequency is used in the end, so this is the only frequency, which travels through the delay line version. Because of the Miller effect a common source transistor acts as a capacitor (non inverting) at high frequencies and has an inverting transconductance at low frequencies. The channel of the transistor has three dimensions. One dimension, the width, is chosen depending on the current needed. The trouble is for a single transistor parasitic capacitance and gain both scale linearly with the width. For the distributed amplifier the capacitance ‚Äì that is the width ‚Äì of the single transistor is chosen based on the highest frequency and the width needed for the current is split across all transistors.  Applications  Note that those termination resistors are usually not used in CMOS, but the losses due to these are small in typical applications. In solid state power amplifiers often multiple discrete transistors are used for power reasons anyway. If all transistors are driven in a synchronized fashion a very high gate drive power is needed. For frequencies at which small and efficient coils are available distributed amplifiers are more efficient. Voltage can be amplified by a common gate transistor, which shows no miller effect and no unit gain frequency cut off. Adding this yields the cascode configuration. The common gate configuration is incompatible with CMOS; it adds a resistor, that means loss, and is more suited for broadband than for high efficiency applications. * Radio * Acousto- optic modulator * time to digital converter  See also  * Gunn diode is a device without any parasitic C or L very suitable for broadband applications * Regenerative circuit is circuit using the parasitics of a single transistor for a high frequency narrow band amplifier * Armstrong oscillator is circuit using the parasitics of a single transistor for a high frequency narrow band oscillator  References   External links  * Microwaves101.com ‚Äì Distributed amplifiers Category:Electronic amplifiers Category:Distributed element circuits ","title":"Distributed amplifier"},{"id":"5630801","title":"Leeds Conservatoire"},{"id":"5630807","text":"Seniors practicing chair yoga Chair yoga is a form of yoga as therapy developed by Lakshmi Voelker-Binder in 1982, practiced sitting on a chair, or standing using a chair for support.

Arrestins were first discovered as a part of a conserved two-step mechanism for regulating the activity of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the visual rhodopsin system by Hermann K√ºhn, Scott Hall, and Ursula Wilden and in the Œ≤-adrenergic system by Martin J. Lohse and co-workers.  Function  In response to a stimulus, GPCRs activate heterotrimeric G proteins. In order to turn off this response, or adapt to a persistent stimulus, active receptors need to be desensitized. The first step in desensitization is phosphorylation of the receptor by a class of serine/threonine kinases called G protein coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). GRK phosphorylation specifically prepares the activated receptor for arrestin binding. Arrestin binding to the receptor blocks further G protein-mediated signaling and targets receptors for internalization, and redirects signaling to alternative G protein-independent pathways, such as Œ≤-arrestin signaling. In addition to GPCRs, arrestins bind to other classes of cell surface receptors and a variety of other signaling proteins.  Subtypes  Mammals express four arrestin subtypes and each arrestin subtype is known by multiple aliases. The systematic arrestin name (1-4) plus the most widely used aliases for each arrestin subtype are listed in bold below: * Arrestin-1 was originally identified as the S-antigen (SAG) causing uveitis (autoimmune eye disease), then independently described as a 48 kDa protein that binds light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin before it became clear that both are one and the same. It was later renamed visual arrestin, but when another cone-specific visual subtype was cloned the term rod arrestin was coined. This also turned out to be a misnomer: arrestin-1 expresses at comparable very high levels in both rod and cone photoreceptor cells. * Arrestin-2 was the first non-visual arrestin cloned. It was first named Œ≤-arrestin simply because between two GPCRs available in purified form at the time, rhodopsin and Œ≤2-adrenergic receptor, it showed preference for the latter. * Arrestin-3. The second non-visual arrestin cloned was first termed Œ≤-arrestin-2 (retroactively changing the name of Œ≤-arrestin into Œ≤-arrestin-1), even though by that time it was clear that non-visual arrestins interact with hundreds of different GPCRs, not just with Œ≤2-adrenergic receptor. Systematic names, arrestin-2 and arrestin-3, respectively, were proposed soon after that. * Arrestin-4 was cloned by two groups and termed cone arrestin, after photoreceptor type that expresses it, and X-arrestin, after the chromosome where its gene resides. In the HUGO database its gene is called arrestin-3. Fish and other vertebrates appear to have only three arrestins: no equivalent of arrestin-2, which is the most abundant non-visual subtype in mammals, was cloned so far. The proto-chordate C. intestinalis (sea squirt) has only one arrestin, which serves as visual in its mobile larva with highly developed eyes, and becomes generic non-visual in the blind sessile adult. Conserved positions of multiple introns in its gene and those of our arrestin subtypes suggest that they all evolved from this ancestral arrestin. Lower invertebrates, such as roundworm C. elegans, also have only one arrestin. Insects have arr1 and arr2, originally termed ‚Äúvisual arrestins‚Äù because they are expressed in photoreceptors, and one non-visual subtype (kurtz in Drosophila). Later arr1 and arr2 were found to play an important role in olfactory neurons and renamed ‚Äúsensory‚Äù. Fungi have distant arrestin relatives involved in pH sensing.  Tissue distribution  One or more arrestin is expressed in virtually every eukaryotic cell. In mammals, arrestin-1 and arrestin-4 are largely confined to photoreceptors, whereas arrestin-2 and arrestin-3 are ubiquitous. Neurons have the highest expression level of both non-visual subtypes. In neuronal precursors both are expressed at comparable levels, whereas in mature neurons arrestin-2 is present at 10-20 fold higher levels than arrestin-3.  Mechanism  Arrestins block GPCR coupling to G proteins in two ways. First, arrestin binding to the cytoplasmic face of the receptor occludes the binding site for heterotrimeric G-protein, preventing its activation (desensitization). Second, arrestin links the receptor to elements of the internalization machinery, clathrin and clathrin adaptor AP2, which promotes receptor internalization via coated pits and subsequent transport to internal compartments, called endosomes. Subsequently, the receptor could be either directed to degradation compartments (lysosomes) or recycled back to the plasma membrane where it can again signal. The strength of arrestin-receptor interaction plays a role in this choice: tighter complexes tend to increase the probability of receptor degradation (Class B), whereas more transient complexes favor recycling (Class A), although this ‚Äúrule‚Äù is far from absolute.  Structure  Arrestins are elongated molecules, in which several intra-molecular interactions hold the relative orientation of the two domains. In unstimulated cell arrestins are localized in the cytoplasm in this basal ‚Äúinactive‚Äù conformation. Active phosphorylated GPCRs recruit arrestin to the plasma membrane. Receptor binding induces a global conformational change that involves the movement of the two arrestin domains and the release of its C-terminal tail that contains clathrin and AP2 binding sites. Increased accessibility of these sites in receptor-bound arrestin targets the arrestin-receptor complex to the coated pit. Arrestins also bind microtubules (part of the cellular ‚Äúskeleton‚Äù), where they assume yet another conformation, different from both free and receptor-bound form. Microtubule-bound arrestins recruit certain proteins to the cytoskeleton, which affects their activity and/or redirects it to microtubule-associated proteins. Arrestins shuttle between cell nucleus and cytoplasm. Their nuclear functions are not fully understood, but it was shown that all four mammalian arrestin subtypes remove some of their partners, such as protein kinase JNK3 or the ubiquitin ligase Mdm2, from the nucleus. Arrestins also modify gene expression by enhancing transcription of certain genes. { -valign=top   }  References   External links  * Category:Peripheral membrane proteins ","title":"Arrestin"},{"id":"5630815","text":"Kenny Roby is a North Carolina-based singer-songwriter.

He played in Major League Baseball as a left-handed pitcher for the Chicago Cubs (1903‚Äì1905), Cincinnati Reds (1906‚Äì1908) and New York Giants (1909). He batted right-handed and threw left-handed. Weimer was born in Ottumwa, Iowa. He toiled for eight years in the minor leagues, before becoming one of the top left-handers in baseball. In a seven-season career, Weimer posted a 97‚Äì69 record with 657 strikeouts and a 2.23 ERA in 1472-2/3 innings pitched. His career ERA ranks 14th all-time, 10th among post-1900 pitchers. He was also a good hitting pitcher in the majors, posting a .213 batting average (115-for-540) with 46 runs, one home run and 36 RBI. Weimer emerged as one of the Chicago Cubs' top starting pitchers in the first part of 20th century. He went 21‚Äì9 with a 2.30 ERA in his 1903 rookie season and 20‚Äì14 with 1.91 in his sophomore year. After going 18‚Äì12 with 2.26 in 1905, he was sent to the Cincinnati Reds for third baseman Harry Steinfeldt and Jimmy Sebring before 1906. In a trade that benefited both teams, Steinfeld hit .327 to lead the Cubs to their first World Series and Weimer won 20 games for Cincinnati, but eventually faded and was sent to the New York Giants after two subpar seasons. He played his final game with the Giants in 1909. Weimer died in Chicago, at the age of 54.

The church lies beside the Kings River, one mile north of Stoneyford village in County Kilkenny, Ireland. Located in the townland of Ennisnag, in the barony of Shillelogher. The 19th century church was constructed on an old medieval monastery and church no longer extant. Probably the most distinguished rector and resident of Ennisnag was the famous Irish antiquarian, James Graves, who died in 1886. In the graveyard, Catholic burials to the rear and the Church of Ireland burials to the front. Among those buried there is Hubert Butler, the Anglo-Irish essayist.  History  The Monastery of Ennisnag was an early Irish Christian monastery, and later a medieval prebendal church, located at Ennisnag, in County Kilkenny, Ireland. Little is known about the monastic community here. Canon William Carrigan suggested \\"an ancient Church stood on the site from time immemorial to after the Cromwellian era\\". John O'Hanlon reported that Diocese of Ossory ecclesiastical records names Saint Manchan as patron saint writing \\"at Inisnag, diocese of Ossory, St. Manchan, whose feast occurs on the 14th of February, was venerated as a patron (Statuta Dioecesis Ossoriensis)\\". So it was probably founded by Manch√°n of Mohill in the 5th or 6th century. The monastery of Inis-Snaig was probably small in scale. The church of Inisnag was recorded as prebendal of Ossory diocese, in the Taxatio Ecclesiastica of AD 1291‚Äì1292, and was granted on \\"the authority of Pope Nicholas IV, 1291 [liber ruber Ossoriensis]\\". The medieval church fell into ruins after the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and upheavals of 17th century Ireland. The medieval monastery and church are no longer extant. From the ruins, St Peter's church, of Protestant denomination, was established in the early 19th century.  Architecture Saint Peter's Church is a protected structure. The Board of First Fruits Church of Ireland built the church 1815 under the architect William Robertson. The church contains a detached three-bay double-height over part-basement single-cell.

It was ported to PlayStation in 1996. The game would be similar to its arcade counterpart with exception to the fact that the Winnipeg Jets moved to Phoenix after the conclusion of the 1995‚Äì96 season, thus the Phoenix Coyotes replaced the Jets in the PlayStation port. In addition, much of the team's roster was changed, including its goalie, Tim Cheveldae being replaced by Nikolai Khabibulin, therefore Cheveldae was unable to be a goalie playing for any team in the PlayStation version. Open Ice was released on PC (Windows) in 1997 featuring the same roster and teams as the PlayStation version. This game is an official licensed product of the NHLPA (National Hockey League Players Association). Development Jack Haeger was lead game designer and an avid hockey player. The lead programmer was Mark Penacho, assisted by Bill Dabelstein. Sound design and music by Jon Hey. The skating sounds were recorded by Jon Hey at the Chicago Park District's only indoor ice rink, McFetridge Sports Center, which is just a block North of what was once Midway's Chicago studios. The announcer in the game is the famous voice of the Chicago Blackhawks Pat Foley. If a team achieves \\"On-Fire\\" status (made famous initially by Midway's NBA Jam), Pat Foley's voice will occasionally announce: \\"Toasty\\", a reference to Mortal Kombat. A version of 2 on 2 Open Ice Challenge for Panasonic M2 was in development and slated to be one of the launch titles but it never occurred due to the system's cancellation. Reception A reviewer for Next Generation called the game \\"NBA Jam on ice\\", and said it would be particularly appreciated since arcade hockey games were almost unheard of at the time. He applauded the game's full NHL licensing and player rosters, flaming pucks, two-on-two mode, commentary, and overall depth and playability of its hockey action, and concluded that \\"Williams rarely makes a bad move, and Open Ice is testament to its conservative but consistent quality games.\\" Bruised Lee of GamePro similarly said the game \\"proves that Midway will continue to dominate the arcade sports market long after the success of NBA Jam.\\" He praised the numerous Easter eggs, sharp graphics, fluid animation, and variety of moves. In 1996 the arcade version was placed on display in the Hockey Hall of Fame. The PlayStation version divided reviewers. Jeff Kitts of GameSpot, The Rookie of GamePro, and Dean Hager of Electronic Gaming Monthly all agreed that it offered fun and fast NBA Jam-style hockey and was a faithful translation of the arcade version. Kitts acknowledged problems with the animations but praised the inclusion of novelty power-up codes, and judged the game an overall refreshing break from realistic hockey sims. The Rookie went so far as to say that it \\"shoots and scores at every level.\\" In contrast, Hager's co-reviewer Kraig Kujawa said it \\"doesn't seem to capture the magic that made that made [NBA Jam] so popular\\", and that it compares poorly to its similar contemporary, Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey for the Nintendo 64. Next Generation agreed that it simply lacked the spark of NBA Jam, and also \\"fails to capture the coin-op's flashy essence\\", citing smaller characters, missing frames of animation, a weaker color palette, and missing audio effects compared to the arcade version. PlayStation Official Magazine ‚Äì UK said that players should \\"avoid the game at all costs\\".

It is a loosely organized group of female wrestlers, most of whom gained superhuman strength through the group known as Power Broker, Inc. The group's first appearance was in Marvel Two-in-One #54, created by Mark Gruenwald, Ralph Macchio and John Byrne. The group's membership was later expanded in Thing #33 written by Mark Gruenwald. The original line up consisted of criminals Titania, Letha, Poundcakes, and Screaming Mimi, organized by Auntie Freeze. The original Grapplers closely resemble members of the DC Comics' group the Female Furies. Screaming Mimi would later become a superhero under the name \\"Songbird\\", while Titania was later renamed \\"Lascivious\\". Publication history The Grapplers first appeared in Marvel Two-in-One #54-56 (August‚ÄìOctober 1979), and were created by writers Mark Gruenwald, Ralph Macchio, and artist John Byrne. Joe Sinnott was the inker of their first appearance, John Costanza was the letterer and Bob Share was the colorist. The Grapplers were later brought back as part of the Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation storyline in the Thing comic book series, with new members introduced in The Thing #33, with new members of the team being created by the writer Mike Carlin and artist Ron Wilson. Auntie Freeze, Butterball, Capiole, Cowgirl, Magilla, Sushi, and Vavavoom have not appeared in the Marvel Universe since Thing #33, except in flashback form. The Grapplers received an entry in the appendix of the first volume of the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe, and a full team entry in volume two including Titania, Poundcakes, Screaming Mimi, Letha, Auntie Freeze, Battleaxe, Sushi, Butterball, Vavavoom, Magilla, Cowgirl, and Gladiatrix. The team also had an entry in issue 5 of the Gamer's Handbook of the Marvel Universe covering the original five members as well as Battleaxe. The team was also covered in the Marvel Encyclopedia Vol 1 '\\"Fantastic Four\\". The team has never been featured in their own comic, neither as a group nor as individuals. Fictional history Titania, Letha, Poundcakes, and Screaming Mimi, the original four Grapplers, were drafted by the Roxxon Oil Company to invade Project: Pegasus, along with the warrior Thundra. They were given designed costumes and specialized weaponry to heighten their formidable prowess at physical combat. However, Quasar and Giant-Man defeated the quartet and gave them over to authorities. The group later attacked Dazzler while they were all incarcerated at Ryker's Island in attempt to get vengeance after the Klaw's seeming death at her hands. After getting beaten to near death, Dazzler was able to defeat the Grapplers with a light blast. The Grapplers then escaped prison and planned to attack the Thing with several other super-villains, though the Avengers, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, and various other super- heroes foiled their plans. Afterward, the Grapplers decided to halt their illegal activities and become legitimate wrestlers. They soon branched out, and several new members joined their ranks. Soon after, Titania was slain by the Scourge of the Underworld. Investigating her death, Letha also soon met her demise at the Scourge's hands. Screaming Mimi later joined the Thunderbolts, while Poundcakes became a freelance mercenary. Letha and Titania were resurrected years later by the Hood, alongside several other victims of the Scourge. The Hood also gifted the pair with new powers: Letha with the ability to inspire irrational rage telepathically and Titania with the ability to inspire irrational lust. Titania took the codename Lascivious to better represent her new power set. The Grapplers then resurfaced, consisting of Letha, Lascivious, Poundcakes, and a new Screaming Mimi. Together, they battled their old teammate Songbird, but were defeated and arrested with the exception of the new Screaming Mimi who was a teenage runaway forced to work with them. The Grapplers escaped imprisonment, and in subsequent appearances often appeared individually or in pairs. Poundcakes was seen breaking out of the Raft alongside Moonstone and several other female criminals. Letha and Lascivious were recruited into the Masters of Evil and spent time in Bagalia. Letha and Poundcakes were later seen with the second Titania, Mary MacPherran at a bar. Artificial constructs of Grapplers members Poundcakes, Battleaxe, and Gladiatrix were used by Yon-Rogg to battle Captain Marvel, though they were quickly defeated. Similarly, Arcade used constructs of the original Grapplers to battle Dazzler. As part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel, Letha and Poundcakes appeared as hired extortionists. They battled Nadia Pym, the new Wasp, along with her allies. The Grapplers' defeat led to their imprisonment, though Nadia and Janet Van Dyne later hired them as bodyguards for their new \\"G.I.R.L.\\" (Genius In action Research Labs) initiative. Membership The original Grapplers, (Titania, Letha, Screaming Mimi, and Poundcakes) and the later retconned leader Auntie Freeze, bear a superficial resemblance to the Female Furies, from Jack Kirby's New Gods (first seen in 1972) as well as mirroring their superpowers. =Titania / Lascivious= Titania (Davida DeVito) was the field leader of the original Grapplers. She wielded an energy rod which enabled her to blast long-range bursts. When the Grapplers were imprisoned, Titania became the leader of the women's wing. While she was crafty, she was also a very sore loser, and the other Grapplers were worried about their reputation after Titania's defeat at the hands of Battleaxe. After the Grapplers attempted to go legitimate as professional wrestlers, Titania was killed by the Scourge of the Underworld posing as a new recruit, Golddigger. She is not to be confused with the more recent Titania, who took her name around the time of her death. Titania, along with her former teammate Letha, was revived by The Hood during \\"Dark Reign\\". The Hood bestowed new powers to DeVito, allowing her to incite uncontrollable lust in those around her. She adopted the new codename Lascivious. The Titania character is analogous to Big Barda, including the fact that she led the team, was physically imposing and used a weapon similar to Big Barda's \\"Mega-rod\\". =Letha= Letha (Hellen Feliciano) is a blonde bombshell who specialized in acrobatic wrestling. She also used specialized leather belts and straps, though she most often battles in hand-to-hand combat. While the other Grapplers were notable for their strong, feminist personalities, Letha instead had a very feminine personality, often flirting with the enemies or showing concern over fashion. After Titania was slain by the Scourge of the Underworld, Letha joined Firebrand and several other super-villains as they plotted a way to stop the vigilante. However, Letha and the others were soon shot to death by the Scourge themselves. Letha, along with Titania (now called Lascivious), was revived by The Hood during \\"Dark Reign\\". Similar to Lascivious, Letha gained new abilities that enabled her to drive those around her into a murderous rage. Letha is similar to Lashina in her choice of weapons, Lashina uses steel whips, while Letha uses leather whips, both have their weapons strapped to their bodies when not using them. =Poundcakes= Poundcakes (Marian Pouncy) is an ex-convict who joined the Grapplers despite her record. She was given seismic boots by Roxxon, which enabled her to create shockwaves and tremors by stomping the ground. Slightly overweight, Poundcakes was the strongest member of the Grapplers. After Titania and Letha had been killed by the Scourge of the Underworld, Poundcakes became a freelance mercenary. She battled Captain America several times and eventually joined the Femizons, though her stay with Superia was short-lived. She later returned to mercenary work and rejoined the Grapplers when Titania (now called Lascivious) and Letha were resurrected by the Hood. The pre-augmented Poundcakes were given \\"seismatic boots\\", the heels of which contain shockwave generators capable of creating minor localized earth tremors, similar to the antimatter boots work by the Female Fury Stompa. =Screaming Mimi= Screaming Mimi (Mimi Schwartz/Melissa Gold) met Poundcakes in prison and soon after, was invited to join the Grapplers. Roxxon operated on Screaming Mimi's vocal cords, giving her the ability to drive a person to insanity with her screams. The only Grappler who is not capable of superhuman strength, Screaming Mimi proved useful on several missions. Soon after Titania and Letha were killed, Screaming Mimi joined the Masters of Evil, and eventually turned over a new leaf, calling herself Songbird and joining the Thunderbolts. Screaming Mimi's resemblance to Mad Harriet was mainly reflected in her appearance and behavior, not a similarity in superpowers. =Auntie Freeze= Auntie Freeze (Ann Fraley) used to be a professional wrestler and was the founder of the Grapplers. Each of the four original Grapplers were prot√©g√©s of Auntie Freeze, and despite her promotion, the Grapplers were unable to gain popularity. She was then contacted by Roxxon, who fitted the four girls to become mercenaries. She later came up with the idea to merge with the Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation (UCWF) and have the girls become legitimate wrestlers to put their past behind them, though the original four did not stick with the idea. the Auntie Freeze character's similarity to Granny Goodness is more in relations to being an older woman who leads the team than any similarity in powers. =Later recruits= Battleaxe Battleaxe (Anita Ehren) is a wrestler who uses a pair of axes as her weapon of choice in addition to her superhuman strength, listed as being in the 50-75 ton range. Among the new recruits, Battleaxe was the only one to succeed in defeating an original member of the Grapplers, Titania. After Titania's murder, Battleaxe blamed the Thing and later battled him in the ring herself. She defeated him but discovered he allowed her to win and she declared the battle void. Later, she joined the Femizons and battled Captain America, as well as the BAD Girls, Inc. Most recently, she was seen battling Ms. Marvel, though she was quickly defeated. Butterball Butterball (Vivian Dolan) is an overweight wrestler who uses her massive body as a weapon, often by throwing herself at an enemy. She joined the second version of the Grapplers that worked for the Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation. Capriole Capriole (real name not revealed) is one of the women who joined the Grapplers in the Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation. Presumably she has the same augmented strength as the other Grapplers that underwent the Power Broker's augmentation process, but it was not depicted. She was only part of the group in their initial UCWF appearance. Cowgirl Cowgirl (Deb Lowry) is a cowboy-themed wrestler with the same augmented strength of the other Grappers who underwent the augmentation process by the Power Broker. While she wears a gun holster and a gun, it is not clear if it is just a prop or not as she has not been depicted as using it. Gladiatrix Gladiatrix (Robbin Braxton) is a professional wrestler. Unlike the other new recruits, Gladiatrix chose to use her massive strength for the good of mankind, though she did serve briefly as an agent of Superia's Femizons. She participated in the Civil War and was commended for her duties as a super-hero. At one point, she tried to join the Avengers, but was inevitably rejected. Magilla Magilla (Sandy Stalmaster) is a wrestler from the UCWF who was given superhuman abilities by the Power Broker and took the name Magilla, as her whole body was covered in hair. Magilla only appeared as part of the initial UCWF storyline, but was not shown as being part of the Grapplers in later appearances. Sushi Sushi (Susan Hayakawa) is a Japanese wrestler who uses karate as her fighting style in addition to her augmented strength. Sushi only appeared as part of the initial UCWF storyline, but was not shown as being part of the Grapplers in later appearances. Vavavoom Vavavoom (Dawn Middlebury) is a wrestler known for her beauty. She possess the same enhanced strength as the rest of the UCWF based Grapplers. While the other Grapplers are known for their muscles, Vavavoom is quite petite and the most conventionally attractive of the group. Vavavoom only appeared as part of the initial UCWF storyline, but was not shown as being part of the Grapplers in later appearances.

Ed. Thomas Derdak. Vol. 1. Chicago, IL: St. James Press, 1988. Business Insights: Essentials. Web. 6 Dec. 2018. The Continental Can Company was founded by Edwin Norton T.G. Cranwell in 1904, three years after the formation of its greatest rival, American Can Company. Continental acquired the patents of United Machinery Company, one of the few companies producing can-making machinery that had not been bought by American Can. CCC began shipping product in 1905. During World War II, Continental Can Company helped the war effort by building aircraft parts and bombs in their manufacturing plants. The United Steelworkers of America was the union representing hundreds of manufacturing workers at Continental Can Company. In 1956, CCC acquired the Hazel-Atlas Glass Company, the third largest producer of glass containers, which led to the United States v. Continental Can Co. Supreme Court ruling in 1964. History The company bought the Standard Tin Plate Company in 1909 to ensure that they would have a steady supply of tin. Continental's original business consisted only of packers' cans for fruits and vegetables. Given the seasonal nature of this work, the company expanded into general canning in 1912. By 1913 the company had acquired all of the interests of a New Jersey corporation also called Continental Can Co., as well as the Export & Domestic Can Co. and the Standard Tin Plate Co. The same year, Continental was incorporated in the state of New York. During the 1920s Continental expanded rapidly, purchasing almost 20 competing companies. It opened its first West Coast plant in 1926. In 1928 Continental acquired the third-largest can company in the country, the United States Can Company. By 1934 Continental and its rival, American Can, were producing approximately two-thirds of the 10 million cans made annually in the US. At this time, the company was operating 38 plants in the US and Cuba. Continental suffered a drop in its income during the Depression, although by 1932 the company had never reported a money-losing year. By the mid-1930s, with 38 plants nationwide, the company employed about 1,800 men and 1,200 women around the Chicago area.Continental Can Co., Encyclopedia of Chicago, Chicago Historical Society, 2004-5 Continental recovered from the Depression years, and by 1940 its operating revenue had increased to $120.7 million from $80.9 million in 1935. In 1940 the company built plants in Canada. Continental expanded during the following decade through acquisitions, and the company entered the fields of paper and fiber containers, bottle caps, and synthetic resins. By the end of the 1940s, the company had 65 plants, including eight plants producing fiber and paper containers, four plants producing crown caps, and one plant producing plastics. By 1954 the company's gross sales reached $616 million, and its net income was approximately $21 million. At that time, Continental was operating 81 plants. During the company's first 50 years, it had purchased and absorbed 28 independent can companies, as well as other concerns producing fiber drums, paper containers, and bottle tops. In 1956 Continental acquired Hazel-Atlas Glass Co., the third-largest US manufacturer of glass containers. Continental then became the first company with a full line of containers in metal, paper, and glass. It also purchased Cochrane Foil Company, a manufacturer and distributor of aluminum plates and rigid foil packages for the frozen-food industry and other food suppliers. The company also bought Robert Gair Company, a leading producer of paperboard products. Due to such acquisitions, Continental briefly surpassed American Can's annual sales, topping $1 billion in 1957. By 1960 the company operated 155 plant facilities. The introduction of the easy-to-open metal can top in 1963 led to an increase in the use of metal cans rather than glass bottles for beverages. By the end of 1966 over 45% of US beer and over 15% of US soft drinks were packaged in metal cans. That same year Continental introduced the first commercially-practical welded can. In 1969 the company acquired Schmalbach- Lubeca-Werke A.G., the largest packaging producer in the European community. By that time, Continental had 228 manufacturing plants. By 1973 the metal can industry was in a crisis due to oversupply and tough competition. Both Continental and American Can were said to have made the wrong decisions in the previous decade by adding capacity for both tin plate and tin-free steel production while the aluminum can was gaining popularity. Another problem was growing public opposition to disposable cans. Continental's profits from domestic can making dropped from $115 million in 1969 to $52 million in 1973. The company closed many old-style integrated manufacturing plants in favor of large automated metal-processing centers and separate can-assembly operations situated near its customers' plants. In 1973 the company developed a system for the ultraviolet curing of inks and coatings on metal plate, and installed a number of such systems. =Continental Group= In 1976, CCC changed its nameContinental Group Company, International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 1.

In early 1991, Continental Can Company was ordered to pay $415 million to some 3,700 former employees and members of the United Steel Workers of America, when the courts found that the company had attempted to defraud the employees of pensions during the late 1970s.

It was incorporated in Alaska on December 31, 1975.Corporations Database. The 13th Regional Corporation is a for-profit corporation presently headquartered in Seattle, Washington, with approximately 5,500 Alaska Native shareholders of Eskimo, American Indian, and Aleut descent. Its original enrollment was of Alaska Natives who were no longer resident in Alaska. Unlike the other 12 Alaska Native regional corporations, The 13th Regional Corporation and its shareholders received only monetary compensation, with no land conveyance, in settlement of aboriginal land claims. The 13th Regional Corporation was involuntarily dissolved by the Division of Corporations, Business and Professional Licensing of the Alaska Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development on December 31, 2013.Corporations Database. This followed the resignation of the corporation's registered agent on May 22, 2013. A website claiming no affiliation with The 13th Regional Corporation or its shareholders is attempting to locate shareholders with the intent of \\"attempt[ing] to revive The 13th Regional Corporation and restore it to working order.\\"http://13thregion.info/ Creation of the 13th Regional Corporation Initially only 12 regional corporations were created after ANCSA's passage in 1971. Its creation was dependent upon how many of approximately 78,000 Alaska Native people eligible for enrollment under ANCSA voted \\"yes\\" on Section 22 of the official enrollment form, which read, \\"Do you elect to establish and be enrolled in a 13th Region?\\" The initial determination of the Bureau of Indian Affairs was that an insufficient number of enrollees voted for creation of a 13th regional corporation, and each of the \\"yes\\" voters was instead designated as a shareholder in one of the original 12 regional corporations. However, a 1975 U.S. District Court ruling by Judge Oliver Gasch overturned the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The 13th Regional Corporation was created under Alaska law as a private for-profit corporation on December 31, 1975. Officers and directors A current listing of The 13th Regional Corporation's officers and directors, as well as documents filed with the State of Alaska since The 13th's incorporation, are available online through the Corporations Database of the Division of Corporations, Business & Professional Licensing, Alaska Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development. Shareholders At incorporation, The 13th Regional Incorporation enrolled 4,537 Alaska Natives, each of whom received 100 shares of corporate stock. The corporation currently has approximately 5,500 shareholders. As an ANCSA corporation, The 13th Regional Corporation has no publicly traded stock and its shares cannot legally be sold, bartered, or traded. With very limited exception, they can only be passed to the descendants of Alaska Natives. A landless corporation With the sole exception of the 13th Regional Corporation, all other ANCSA Corporations received three separate methods of compensation in settlement of their Alaska Native land claims. Those three compensations were A)Cash[the initial capitalization], B)Land [Land was intended to be a primary revenue sustaining resource] and C)a revenue sharing program called 7(i)[7(i) was created to provide an annual recapitalization for all ANCSA Corporations excluding the 13th Regional Corporation]. The 13th Regional Corporation only received A)Cash [the initial capitalization](There is the misconception that the 13th received more cash per capita than the other corporations. The 13th received the same amount per capita as all others). ANCSA does not provide an explanation as to why the 13th Regional Corporation and its more than 4,000 Alaska Native Shareholders were denied equal treatment. As important as the first two compensations of A)Cash and B)Land were, without questions the most critical and financial sustaining to all other ANCSA Corporations (Both Region and Villages) was the final compensation of C) 7(i) program. The 7(i) program provided all other ANCSA Corporations with an annual recapitalization worth millions of dollars to each of the 12 ANCSA Region. It has been said that without the annual supply of 7(i) recapitalization funds, at least 8 of the 12 regional corporation would be insolvent today. The fact that the 13th Regional Corporation lasted more than 30 years without any access to 7(i) funding in any form is nothing short of amazing. It is also noteworthy that in the year that the 13th became insolvent with an outstanding obligation of approximately $2.5 million, if it had participated equally with the other 12 regions, it would have received approximately $5 million in 7(i) funding and not have been insolvent. Unlike the other corporations created under ANCSA, the 13th was denied by Congress from receiving ANCSA land as was provided the other 12 regions. If Congress had not inexplicitly denied the 13th land, their entitlement would have been approximately 1.2 million acres. Because the 13th shareholders did not receive an equal entitlement of land they have been denied any share in 7(i) revenues generated through sales of minerals, timber, and other valuable resources or development of selected lands through the revenue pooling provisions of ANCSA, as do the original 12 corporations and their shareholders. This difference has created two generations of 13th shareholders who feel that they have been unfairly and inequitably disregarded by Congress and their close relatives in the other 12 regions. The question for Congress and the 12 regionals is was it ANCSA's intention that each Alaska Native would receive a \\"fair and equitable settlement\\" of aboriginal land claims. Problems with corporate management Initially, the corporation was provided $52 million in settlement money, half of which was disbursed to shareholders. The corporation for investment on behalf of its shareholders retained the remainder. However, the corporation's early losses led to charges of mismanagement of corporate assets. According to a 1998 special report by the newspaper Juneau Empire, the 13th Regional Corporation \\"still can't say exactly what happened to the remaining $27 million of land claims the corporation kept‚Äîrecords are incomplete. Present management [as of 1998] and past management both say mismanagement by administrators or the board of directors was to blame for the 13th's early losses.\\" The Juneau Empire followed with, \\"Lawyers looked into the corporation's books. They determined that there may have been enough evidence of dubious activity to pursue lawsuits but proceeding with litigation would have cost more than would be recouped, [1998 Chairman Kurt] Engelstad said.\\" =M Kennedy Construction= Kurt Engelstad and former President Norm Ream both figured prominently in the \\"rebuilding\\" years of the 1990s to 2004. Ream was instrumental in the 13th's purchase of 51 percent ownership in M Kennedy Construction, Inc. (MKC). MKC had been founded in 1979 as a sole proprietorship company and was incorporated in 1992. With The 13th's purchase of 51 percent ownership, MLK became a majority-owned subsidiary of the 13th, making it a \\"minority and economically disadvantaged business enterprise[s]\\" under the Small Business Administration's (SBA) 8(a) program.,The 13th Regional Corporation (official website), and giving it a significant advantage in competing for government contracts. MLK's minority owner, with 49 percent interest, was Michael Kennedy. In 2004, The 13th Regional Corporation bought out Kennedy's shares of MKC for $2.2 million,Hart, 2005-07-25. thus making MKC a wholly owned subsidiary of the 13th. Kennedy went on to form a new corporation in June 2004, Kennedy Services LLC, also focused on construction contracts. However, it was not disclosed to shareholders that Norm Ream, who resigned from The 13th around the same time,The 13th Connection, 2003-09. was named as part owner and treasurer of the new venture, an apparent conflict of interest given his involvement shortly before as president and director in The 13th's buyout of MLK. Former MLK employee Jimmy Mortensen was named as a third partner. Complicating the matter was the fact that MLK had only two years remaining to its eligibility in the 8(a) program, which would presumably lower its value, throwing into question its valuation at $4.4 million at the time Kennedy was paid $2.2 million to buy out his shares. Shareholders questioned if $4.4 million was an accurate market value, or if improprieties had occurred. =Mail Boxes Etc.= Kurt Engelstad, on the other hand, was instrumental in bringing The 13th Regional Corporation into the world of Mail Boxes Etc., which would later become UPS Stores. He, along with Bent Petersen (from Montana), was managing the building of the northwest franchise base for Mail Boxes, Etc. While at the same time drawing salaries (which were not reported in annual reports to shareholders), the two received increasing ownership interests in the franchiser operations, then known as NW Business Services Group LLC. The Board of Directors during this period, however, authorized loans for hundreds of thousands of dollars to Engelstad and Peterson, to finance their increasing share of ownership of the operations. These loans were not fully disclosed in annual reports to shareholders. In 2004 the two bought out the 13th's last 66% interest in the operations. The last Audited Financial Statement available to the public (for 2005) reported a net loss of $1,850,166 on net losses of $869,936 on construction contracts, net losses of $185,428 on contract electrical services, and net losses of $794,802 on corporate operations. Revenues for construction and electrical contracting went from $31,835,643 in 2004 to $8,968,568 in 2005. Private quarterly reports detailing continued operations since December 2005 are available to shareholders upon request by calling 206-575-6229 and identifying yourself as a shareholder and requesting the latest quarterly statements. 2004 Audited Financial Statements revealed that in 2004 several checks, most signed by the then CEO (Ken Krajewski) and the office administrative assistant (Suzy Villegas) ‚Äîand totaling over $2.2 million‚Äîleft the company over several months in a deal that The 13th's Board of Directors claim that the then-acting CEO Krajewski \\"had no authority to enter into\\". Liz Ross, Chairman of the Board, relieved Krajewski of his duties with pay pending an investigation. The board hired Jim Fowler as an attorney and appointed Ross as CEO. Also in 2004, the former CEO (Krajewski) \\"claimed breach of contract and discrimination upon his termination. The 13th settled with the CEO in January 2005 and the settlement amount has been accrued at December 31, 2004.\\" Other highlights in the 2004 Audited Financial Statements include: $130,000 moved from trust for missing shareholders into \\"operating cash accounts in 2004\\"; Deficit in operations with Dick Pacific, Ltd., joint venture of almost $375,000, and a reduction of venturers' equity of about 20% in a joint venture with Chugach Support Services (related to another ANCSA corporation). Business enterprises Under federal law, The 13th Regional Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries, joint ventures and partnerships are deemed to be \\"minority and economically disadvantaged business enterprise[s]\\" (43 USC 1626(e)). The 13th's subsidiaries include: * Alindeska Electrical Contractors (AEC). Headquartered in Tukwila, Washington. Wholly owned subsidiary. Union contractor specializing in private and government electrical construction services. * M Kennedy Co., Inc. (MKC). Headquartered in Bremerton, Washington. Wholly owned subsidiary.

In 1997, The 13th Regional Corporation purchased 51% ownership to meet qualification in applying for government contracts through the minority/disadvantaged element of the Small Business Administration (SBA) 8(a) program. The 13th Regional Corporation bought out the remaining 49% ownership in 2004. * North Star Industrial Contractors (NSIC). Headquartered in Bremerton, Washington. Wholly owned subsidiary.

Both the common name, spiny softshell, and the specific name, spinifera (spine- bearing), refer to the spiny, cone-like projections on the leading edge of the carapace, which are not scutes (scales). Description The spiny softshell turtle's scientific name is very descriptive of the animal. Apalone comes from the Greek word apalos, meaning soft or tender, and spinifera is of Latin origin; spina- referring to thorn or spine and -ifer meaning bearing. This species is a member of the family Trionychidae, and one of the most distinguishing features of members in this family is the presence of a leathery, moderately flexible carapace. This is caused by loss of keratinized scutes and some bony tissue loss. Spiny softshell turtles have webbed feet, each with three claws. Another distinguishing feature of softshell turtles is the presence of a fleshy, elongated nose. The carapace (the upper part of the shell) ranges from brown or yellow-brown to olive in color, while the plastron (lower part of the shell) is lighter, usually white or yellow. Hatchlings usually have dark spots on the carapace, but as females age, they frequently become darker in color, or their carapace becomes splotched. Males tend to maintain the same coloration pattern from birth. Coloration also varies between each subspecies, and the exact coloration can also depend on an individual turtle's environment. Spiny softshell turtles are cryptically colored, meaning that their coloration helps them blend in with their surrounding environment. Spiny softshell turtles also have pale lines bordered by black lines running from its head down the side of its neck. The carapace length ranges from 18-54 cm, with females growing larger than males. The namesake spines are found along the anterior border of the carapace and are more commonly found in males. The variation in coloration, size, and spine presence indicates that this species exhibits sexual dimorphism. Respiration A. spinifera turtles are bimodal breathers, meaning they have the ability (to some degree) to perform oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange by breathing air or while breathing underwater. A variety of factors allow for these turtles to perform respiration underwater. They have an increase of cutaneous surface area and blood flow, reduction in lung size, and increase of respiratory epithelium in the cloaca and buccopharynx. Spiny softshell turtles are more dependent on underwater respiration than other freshwater species. This has led to their low tolerance of hypoxic waters; this becomes especially important during times of hibernation, when these turtles must choose hibernacula that are unlikely to become hypoxic. Geographic range The spiny softshell has a wide range, extending throughout much of the United States, as well as north into the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, and south into the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo Le√≥n, Coahuila and Chihuahua. Ecological range The spiny softshell can be found in bodies of fresh water including ponds, lakes, rivers, tributaries, and streams. They inhabit shallow water (less than 1 m deep), but can also be found as far as 10 m deep. They can be found in areas with varying levels of vegetation, and although they are generally found in more slow-moving waters, this species can be found in fast-moving waters than other, less-aquatic species of turtles. Spiny softshells prefer waters with sandy bottoms and clean, sandy banks. Sandy environments are important for nesting sites, proper juvenile growth and development, and camouflage. Spiny softshells migrate between warm and cold seasons. In each season, turtles generally stay in a single zone, and they move more within their zone during warm months. Diet Spiny softshell turtles feed on a variety of food items. They commonly consume insects, crayfish, fish, algal stocks and other plant material, and mussels. They are generally observed as benthic feeders; they can either actively hunt prey or bury themselves in the sand and wait to ambush prey. Taxonomy The species was first described by Charles Alexandre Lesueur in 1827. It has been redescribed numerous times, leading to some confusion in its taxonomy.California Turtle & Tortoise Club: Softshell Turtles. The recognized subspecies differ in the markings on their carapaces, on the sides of their heads, and on their feet. These markings, which are distinct as hatchlings, fade as the turtles grow larger. Adult females of the various subspecies, which grow larger than males, are not easily distinguishable from one another, and sometimes can only be assigned to a particular subspecies based on geography.Conant R (1975). A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America, Second Edition. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. 429 pp. (Softshell Turtles: Family Trionychidae, pp. 76-77). Reproduction Spiny softshells begin mating between ages 8 and 10. A large female turtle may live up to 50 years. The turtles mate in mid-to-late spring in deep water. The male will nudge the female's head while swimming, and if she chooses to mate, the male will swim above the female without clasping her with his claws (unlike other turtles). A few months later, the female turtle quickly lays her eggs along a sunny sandbar or gravel bank in a flask-shaped cavity she has dug close to the water. The turtle nests more than once during a single season. She can lay between 9 and 38 round, calcareous-shelled eggs. The eggs are laid around July and September, and they hatch in the spring. Unlike in other turtles, in the spiny softshell turtle, the sex of the hatchlings is not determined by temperature variations; it is determined by genetics. The nesting sites are at risk of predation from animals such as coyotes, foxes, and raccoons. Subspecies Six subspecies of A. spinifera are recognized, including the nominate subspecies: *Northern spiny softshell turtle (or eastern spiny softshell.), A. s. spinifera (Lesueur, 1827) *Gulf Coast spiny softshell turtle, A. s. aspera (Agassiz, 1857) *Black spiny softshell turtle or Cuatro Cienegas softshell turtle, A. s. atra (Webb & Legler, 1960) *Texas spiny softshell turtle, A. s. emoryi (Agassiz, 1857) *Guadalupe spiny softshell turtle, A. s. guadalupensis (Webb, 1962) *Pallid spiny softshell turtle, A. s. pallida (Webb, 1962) A previously recognized subspecies, Apalone spinifera hartwegi (Conant & Goin, 1941), has been synonymized to A. s. spinifera as of 2011. Genomics A rough-draft assembly of the A. spinifera aspera genome was completed in 2013 by the Genome Institute at Washington University - St. Louis.

Zakatek was born just prior to Karachi becoming part of Pakistan and is best known for his work with the British bands Gonzalez and The Alan Parsons Project. Early years In 1964, Zakatek formed a rock band called The Trailblazers, as lead singer and rhythm guitarist. On their first tour of US military bases in Europe, they became familiar with the Motown sound. The Trailblazers returned to the UK with a new soul influence and were renamed Funky Fever. They toured the UK and Europe for several years and also played nightclubs in London, including Gulliver's, Whisky a Go Go, The Marquee, Ronnie Scott's, The Scotch of St. James and The Revolution. Funky Fever also backed Inez and Charlie Foxx and The Drifters on their European tours. Lynsey de Paul and Dudley Moore took an interest in Zakatek's voice, look and stage presence in the early 1970s. De Paul dubbed him \\"Zakatek\\" and wrote two singles \\"I Gotcha Now\\" backed with \\"So Good To You\\" (later recorded by de Paul as the B-side on her hit single \\"Won't Somebody Dance With Me\\") and singles \\"Get Your Gun\\" backed with \\"Gotta Runaway\\". A German version of \\"Get Your Gun\\" entitled \\"Roter Mann\\", with German lyrics by Gunther Gabriel, was recorded by Zakatek and released in 1974. De Paul introduced him to the UK through an article in the Daily Mirror entitled \\"Sugar Girl's Heap Big Find\\". The musicians who were featured on Zakatek's solo work were already known as some of the members of 10cc. Success Between 1974 and 1981, Zakatek was the lead singer with Gonzalez. They recorded successful albums, including Our Only Weapon Is Our Music, and Shipwrecked. The worldwide disco hit, \\"Haven't Stopped Dancing Yet\\" came from this collaboration. In 1977, Zakatek became a studio vocalist for The Alan Parsons Project, singing on their albums over a ten year period. He was featured on twenty-four songs on eight Alan Parsons Project albums, including the hits \\"I Wouldn't Want to Be Like You\\", \\"Games People Play\\", \\"You Don't Believe\\" and \\"Damned If I Do\\". The allaboutjazz.com reviewer Todd S. Jenkins wrote that: \\"Lenny Zakatek's singing on [\\"I Wouldn't Want To Be Like You\\" and \\"Games People Play\\"] is prototypical of soulful prog- rock ... detached from the electronic melange.\\" Solo work 1979 saw the release of Zakatek's first solo album Lenny Zakatek, which was produced by Alan Parsons for A&M; Records. Single releases included \\"Brandy\\", \\"Say I Love You\\" and \\"Where Is The Love\\". In 1986, Zakatek formed a band called The Immortals, with John Deacon on bass guitar, and Robert Ahwai on lead guitar. Their single \\"No Turning Back\\" was included on the soundtrack to the film Biggles. In 1986, he guested on the track \\"Angel\\", written by Bob Weston, included on the Dick Morrissey album Souliloquy, and which also featured both Ahwai and Weston. In 1988, he began a parallel career as a manager, music publisher and record producer. He managed and co-produced three of Japan's most prolific recording artists, Tomoyasu Hotei, Miki Imai and Kumiko Yamashita. he also co-wrote and produced several songs on Hotei's first solo album, Guitarhythm. In the UK he managed 7th Heaven, Huff and Herb, and The 3 Jays. The latter two acts achieved successes in the dance market. Zakatek's publishing company All Zakatek Music, co-published some of the cuts on Kubb's debut album. He has published and managed Sony/BMG artist Jah Waggie, the creative alter-ego of Jeff Patterson. Zakatek's second solo album Small But Hard, was released in 1989. In 1995, Zakatek performed with Joni Mitchell at the Great Music Experience in Nara City, Japan. He shared the stage with INXS, Bon Jovi, Bob Dylan and Tomoyasu Hotei and worked with Michael Kamen, with whom he went to do other projects. 2000 onwards Zakatek now plays throughout Europe and the UK with the Boogie Brothers, a 12 piece R&B; band. He has also appeared at corporate events as a solo performer, along with his son and daughter Amber du Platel and singer-songwriter Leon du Platel. In March 2010, Zakatek announced a return to the stage playing a selection of Alan Parsons Project songs. He also performed on Frankie Miller's album of duets Frankie Miller's Double Take (2016), appearing with Miller on the track \\"I Never Want To Lose You\\". The songs on this album were recorded as demos by Miller prior to his brain haemorrhage in New York in 1994.

Introduced populations have also been found in Massachusetts, New Jersey, Arizona, and VirginiaDaniel, W.M., and Morningstar, C., 2020, Apalone spinifera spinifera (Lesueur, 1827): U.S. Geological Survey, Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database, Gainesville, FL, https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?SpeciesID=1276, Revision Date: 10/22/2019, Peer Review Date: 3/1/2019, Access Date: 7/13/2020. Etymology Apalone spinifera spinifera has sometimes been used only to designate populations east of the Mississippi Populations, while populations west of the Mississippi have been designated Apalone spinifera hartwegi. The subspecific name hartwegi is in honor of Dr. Norman Edouard Hartweg (1904-1964), who was a specialist in turtles and professor of zoology at the University of Michigan.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Apalone spinifera hartwegi, p. 117). While some morphological differences exist between northeastern and northwestern populations, a phylogeographic study found little genetic support for a distinction between eastern and western populations and recommended both groups be simply referred to as northern spiny softshell turtles. This designation is currently recognized in the most up-to-date taxonomic checklist.Turtle Taxonomy Working Group [Rhodin, A.G.J., Iverson, J.B., Bour, R.

He was an immigrant to Canada who transformed the grocery store founded by his mother, Steinberg's Supermarket, into one of the largest chains in the Province of Quebec. By the time of his death in 1978, Steinberg's was the largest supermarket chain in Quebec. Life and career When he was four years old, Steinberg's family immigrated to Canada and settled in Montreal, where his mother opened a small grocery store. In 1934, Steinberg opened his first self-service grocery supermarket in the city. A visionary, he transformed food retailing through mass merchandising, mechanization, and personnel management that included a bilingualism policy for all company employees. By the end of the 1950s, his stores were a dominant force throughout the Province of Quebec, and in 1959 expanded into the province of Ontario with the acquisition of 38 Grand Union stores. Steinberg would drive around the city, size up an area very quickly, acquire a property, and build a store on the site. He later set up Ivanhoe Investments. Steinberg married his cousin Helen (n√©e Roth) in 1929. The couple funded a number of philanthropic causes including The Pavilion of Judaism at Expo 67, the Helen & Sam Steinberg Foundation's Geriatric Day Hospital, the Family Career Scientist Award and the Sam Steinberg Award For Young Jewish Entrepreneur of the Year given by the Jewish Chamber of Commerce of Montreal. Steinberg was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and inducted into the Canadian Business Hall of Fame for his contribution to the Canadian economy. He was the subject of a 1974 National Film Board of Canada documentary, After Mr. Sam, which explored the issue of his impending retirement and his replacement. Steinberg died suddenly from heart failure on May 24, 1978 at the age of 72. He was survived by three daughters: Marilyn, Evelyn (died 1993) and Mitzi (died 2019). Steinberg's second-born daughter, Rita, died in 1970. Disagreement among the daughters led to the sale of the family business in 1989, and the Steinberg family name disappeared from the stores in 1992. Helen Steinberg died in 2007 at the age of 98, and she was buried next to her husband in Montreal's Shaar Hashomayim Cemetery in Mount Royal. See also * H.

Geographic range Gulf coast spiny soft shell turtles are found along the Gulf of Mexico from North Carolina to Mississippi. They live in temperate climates in freshwater biomes.Harding, J. 1997. Amphibians and Reptiles of the Great Lakes Region. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press. Description Apalone spinifera aspera differs from other subspecies of Apalone spinifera in having two or more black lines running along the posterior border of the carapace. It also has scattered ocelli or ring-shaped spots on the carapace, which may be obscure in adult females.Smith, H.M. and E.D. Brodie, Jr. 1982. Reptiles of North America: A Guide to Field Identification Golden Press. New York. 240 pp. (Trionyx spiniferus asperus, pp. 32-33.) The edges of the carapace are soft with small spines. The head and neck usually have yellow and brown stripes and spot-like markings that lead up to a long upward pointed nose. The underbelly is whitish or yellow with bones visible underneath. The body is olive or tan with black speckles and a dark rim around the edge of their shell. Adult males have olive and yellow coloration on their carapaces, with black \\"eyespots\\", and a thicker tail than females. Males are also smaller than females, with a shell length of 12.7 to 24 cm. Females are 24 to 48 cm in length, with a dark carapace and a small tail that doesn't go beyond the edge of their carapace. Their feet are webbed for swimming, with their toes ending in claws. They often have oxymoronic rings, similar to the featherquill porcupine or rubbertooth shark. Large females can live upwards of 50 years. Habitat Gulf coast spiny soft shell turtles inhabit various freshwater sources such as rivers, lakes, marshes, farm ponds, as well as bays of larger lakes. They prefer open habitats with a small amount of vegetation and a sandy or muddy bottom. They require sandy raised nesting areas close to water.Behler, J., F. King. 1998. National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Reptiles and Amphibians. Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.. Behavior These turtles are diurnal animals, spending most of the day basking in the sun and foraging for food. They are often seen sunning themselves on logs, river banks, or lake shores. If disturbed, they will quickly retreat into the water and bury themselves in sand, leaving only their heads visible. Like most turtles, they are able to breathe underwater for extended periods of time. They will spend the colder months underwater, buried in the mud or sand in a state of dormancy.Spiny Softshell. http://www.herpsofnc.org/herps_of_NC/turtles/Apaspi/apaspi.html When bothered, spiny softshell turtles will extend their long necks and snap viciously at their attacker, inflicting a painful bite. Diet Spiny softshell turtles are carnivores preying mostly on invertebrates, such as, crayfish and aquatic insects. When they are large enough they will occasionally prey upon small fish. They find their food underneath rocks, logs, branches, along the floor of lakes, rivers, and streams, and in vegetation. They will sometimes hide in the floor substrate and ambush prey as it swims by. =Predators= Spiny softshell turtles have few natural predators including, large predatory fish, raccoons, herons, skunks, red foxes, and occasionally humans. Their nests are often destroyed by raccoons, skunks, and foxes. Young softshell turtles are eaten by raccoons, herons, and large fish; adults, on the other hand, are killed and eaten only by humans. Being shy creatures they will quickly dive and hide under mud and sand to avoid predators.Conant, R., J. Collins. 1998. A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians; Eastern and Central North America.

Meanwhile, Mike‚Äôs boss (Ray Silak) enters the apartment with the team and shoots the model murderer. Rollie tells Silak that the killer got away but Silak wonders why he would think that there was a third person in the apartment. Rollie is suspicious and secretly collects his hidden cameras but must leave one behind. Rollie immediately calls Leo McCarthy, a cop he had worked with before, and leaves a message to say that he‚Äôs in trouble and needs help. The next day, Rollie, his girlfriend Kim and her son Chris go to Mike‚Äôs house to collect some personal items. The house is being thoroughly searched by cops. They are even searching through the files on floppy disks, including Chris‚Äôs game disk which is snatched away by Kim. Silak is there. He gives Rollie back the camera from the crime scene, asking why the apartment was being filmed. He now knows that Rollie saw Mike‚Äôs killer and plants the idea that it may have been a cop. He asks Rollie if Mike mentioned any old cases he was working on. As soon as they leave Silak, Rollie suspects Mike was set up and drives Kim and Chris to her sister‚Äôs house to keep them safe. That night at their loft, Rollie looks through the camera‚Äôs footage. He sees Silak planting evidence to indicate that the model murderer also killed Mike. Rollie doesn‚Äôt notice the door bolts being unlocked as he searches the recording. Just as Rollie finds footage of the killer, the killer appears before him and demands the recording. Rollie is able to manoeuvre the killer to be in range of Bluey and uses the telemetry suit to control the robot‚Äôs actions while it fights the intruder. The killer overcomes the robot and the fight leads to the fire escape, with Leo showing up to save the day in the nick of time. At Leo‚Äôs closed bar, he listens to the story from Rollie and deduces that Silak is interested in an old, unsolved case that Mike was working on in his spare time. The next day, he asks his old police contact Velez if she would discreetly check into Mike‚Äôs cases. Meanwhile, Rollie sneaks into Silak‚Äôs office and taps his phone. Back at the bar, Leo and Rollie intercept a call from Silak to someone named Neely, an inmate who is given the details to say for his court appearance in exchange for information. The next day, Leo arrives in court to listen to the case that Neely is testifying for. His testimony makes the case. Leo meets with Neely‚Äôs lawyer after the court session, an old friend of his named Liz Kennedy. He warns her that Neely‚Äôs testimony was supplied to him. Leo visits Neely at the prison and sees him visiting the bedside of a dying old inmate. Although Neely refuses to speak with him, Leo finds out that the old man is Carl Becker. Back at the bar, Leo brings Rollie up to speed with Becker‚Äôs notoriety. The old inmate had stolen solid gold medallions that were cast by Michelangelo depicting the bronze figures in the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. He was arrested quite shortly after the theft but the coins were never recovered. This was the case that Mike had been working on. While this conversation is happening, the killer follows Kim as she leaves her workplace. Rollie remembers the floppy disk that had Chris‚Äôs games on it had a file named Becker. He calls Chris and learns that Kim went to work even though he had told her it was unsafe. Rollie leaves to find Kim while Leo arranges for Chris to send the file to Velez by modem, the nearest one being at the mall. At the mall, Chris is ready to send the file just as his mom arrives, followed closely by the killer who then threatens her. Chris begins the file transfer. Leo is waiting with Velez and watches as the file is received. One name that is new from the file is Samson. The mall closes just as Rollie arrives and barges his way in. He finds Kim and Chris being threatened by the killer. He manages to get them away from the killer and into the mall grocery store. Rollie uses the items he can find to create traps for the killer while they find a way out. All exits are blocked, so Rollie lures the killer to the meat packaging machine and incapacitates him. Leo takes Velez for a celebratory dinner at his favourite Chinese place - a street vendor in Chinatown. Just as they begin to eat, a single gunshot kills Velez before a drive-by shooting targets the street vendor. Meanwhile, Neely makes a last visit to a dying Becker, asking him to unburden his soul by sharing the location of the coins. Later, Leo drinks in the near dark of his bar as Rollie comes in. They update each other about Velez and the killer, who is just a hired thug. The thug did give up the information that Silak has a helicopter booked for that weekend. Leo visits Liz. His superficial wounds are looked after as her cat demands his attention. He tells Liz his plans regarding capturing Silak at the location where the chopper will be and insists that she be there in person, as it would help her career. Neely meets Silak and they are both followed by Rollie. They go to a cathedral so that Neely can retrieve the hidden coins. Cut to Rollie gathering special effects gear in the back of his van. That weekend, Neely and Silak enter a large, secluded house with the gold medallions. They are met by several guards, the buyer, and an authenticator. Meanwhile, Rollie sets off various effects to trap the guard dogs and take the guards out of commission one by one. Leo and Liz arrive and Leo gives her a gun just in case there‚Äôs trouble. As the authenticator examines the coins, Leo walks into the room with his gun drawn. He is soon unarmed by Liz herself and relegated to informing Neely and Silak about the buyer - he‚Äôs part of the mob. The coins are authenticated, a guard takes them out to the boat, and the chopper arrives. Leo asks questions of everyone about the situation and learns that the mob plans to return the coins to the Vatican. Suddenly, an explosion outside unnerves everyone. Leo presses Liz to give up her gun and he is shot as she panics. Neely takes her gun just as the guard, on fire, bursts into the room from the backyard. Neely and Silak grab the money and the coins from the guard and run to the chopper. Once there, Neely shoots Silak but the gun has blanks. Silak shoots Neely instead and boards the chopper. Liz turns her attention away from the chaos outside only to see Leo very much alive. The burned guard turns out to be Rollie covered in the firesafe gel. Rollie runs out to the boat while Leo makes his disappointment known to Liz. He had discovered her involvement in the scheme when he saw the name given to her cat - Samson. Her criminal involvement was confirmed when the backup she was to arrange for didn‚Äôt show up. Sirens are heard approaching. It‚Äôs the backup that Leo had called just in case they were needed. Liz is left to wait for them. Leo joins Rollie in the boat. In the chopper, Silak becomes worried when the helicopter changes direction and begins to fly haphazardly. He berates the pilot only to see that it‚Äôs a clown. Rollie, in the telemetry suit in the boat, has Bluey let go of the controls, which Silak quickly grabs. The clown robot reaches behind its seat for the case with the money then jumps from the plane. Rollie and Leo fish the robot and case from the water. Leo wonders how long it will take them to dry the money when Rollie produces the gold medallions that he had safely hidden. Leo informs him that the mob was going to return the coins to the Vatican so he shouldn‚Äôt have stolen them. A collection plate is being passed around a church service. It stops between two men and they drop a set of golden coins into it. Afterwards, Leo and Rollie leave the church and decide what they should have for lunch with their newly-dried money. As they walk and banter about food, the camera pans out to show that they are in Rome. During the credits Silak is still in the helicopter and thus ends the movie.

He said Franklin \\"had some kind of personal problems going on, but I think there was a lot of stuff happening behind the scenes that I didn't know about.\\" Critical reception The sequel was not as successful as the first film. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times commented that \\"'FX2' is more elaborate [than the original], especially in its gadgetry, and at times more improbable than the original, but it‚Äôs just as much fun, largely because Brian Dennehy‚Äôs veteran Irish cop now gets equal screen time with Brown.\\" Stephen Holden of The New York Times opined that \\"as long as it is fixated on gadgetry, 'FX2' is reasonably entertaining. But when the movie focuses on plot and character, it turns quite dotty in an amiable way. The story is as far-fetched as it is tortuous and deals with police corruption, the theft of some priceless gold coins, relations between the Mafia and the Vatican, and a boy's computer software. It also involves two double crosses, neither of which comes as much of a surprise. At the end of the movie, loose ends are dangling everywhere.\\" Paul Willistein of The Morning Call of Allentown, Pennsylvania dismissed the film as \\"kiddie fare, lacking the intelligence and wit of the original with plot holes so big the real special effect here will be holding the audience's attention span.\\" On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a \\"rotten\\" score of 38% from 16 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four and said, \\"There should be a special category for movies that are neither good nor bad, but simply excessive. [...] F/X 2 is actually the kind of movie that rewards inattention. Sit quietly in the theater and watch it, and you will be driven to distraction by its inconsistencies and loopholes. But watch it on video, paying it half a mind, and you might actually find it entertaining.\\" =Box office= The movie debuted at No. 1.

The two albums (or at least their material) were released together under the Are Me title in several \\"deluxe\\" release methods before Are Men received its own proper official release in February 2007. In this way, Are Me and Are Men together may be considered the band's seventh full-length original-material studio album. The album's artwork was created by Team Macho who also did similar artwork for the Are Me releases. The title is an extension of the Are Me title. During touring for the two albums, a pre-show video showed an unidentified hand adding various other extensions to the Barenaked Ladies Are Me title. The formal release of the album is an Enhanced CD, and contains software and individual tracks that allow the owner to remix three of the band's songs. An advanced release of the album, exclusive to Canadian Starbucks, was released on October 3, 2006. This version lacked the Enhanced CD feature, as well as final four tracks, which at the time were deemed \\"bonus tracks\\" for the Are Me release, both in its single-album form, and its 25-track deluxe form. The Starbucks version, however, included the two singles at the time from Are Me. Upon its release, Barenaked Ladies Are Men reached No. 102 in the US and No. 39 in the band's native Canada. Are Men is the second full-length release by the Barenaked Ladies on their own record label.

Public policy schools typically train students in two streams. The more practical stream treats the master's degree as a terminal degree, which trains students to work as policy analysts in governments, think tanks and consulting firms. A more theoretical stream aims to train students who are aiming to go on to complete doctoral studies (e.g., a PhD), with the goal of becoming professors of public policy or researchers. Public policy schools offer a wide range of public policy degrees. At the undergraduate level, universities offer the bachelor of arts with a major in public policy or policy studies. These undergrad degrees are typically offered by a university's public administration or political science faculties. Master of Public Policy (MPP), the Master of Public Administration (MPA), the Master of Public Affairs (MPAff), the Master of Public Service (MPS), the Master of Urban Planning (MUP), and the Master of International Affairs (MIA). Schools with an international and interdisciplinary focus award the Master of Arts in International Policy Studies.MAIPS at MIIS MAIPS at Stanford Some schools also offer executive master's degrees in the same topics for mid-career individuals. Doctoral degrees include PhDs in public policy, policy studies, and public administration, as well as the Doctor of Public Administration (DPA). Some schools offer relatively short-duration certificate programs aimed at working policy analysts, government managers and public executives. In North America, students typically pursue a graduate public policy degree after having completed an undergraduate degree, either in a public administration or political science field. Some programs admit students with any undergraduate degree; however, students without a background in public administration or political science may be required to do qualifying courses in these areas. Some universities allow students to complete both degrees concurrently. North American public policy programs are generally located in an autonomous graduate or professional school within a larger university. Curriculum Most public policy programs combine elements of political science, economics, statistics, law, international relations, international development, public finance, leadership studies, ethics, sociology, and public administration. More recently, public policy schools have applied quantitative analysis, management information systems, organizational behavior, project management, and operations research to the public sector. While degrees in Public Policy are generally at the graduate level (masters and PhD), some undergraduate degree programs still exist. Admission In contrast to many other graduate- level programs, applicants with various, sometimes unrelated, educational backgrounds can be admitted to public policy schools. Applicants' backgrounds can range from programs which have a significant content overlap, such as public administration, economics and political science, to undergraduate majors that are related, such as the social sciences, to undergraduate programs which may have little content overlap (e.g., physical sciences and engineering). Students without an undergraduate major in a related field may be required to complete qualifying undergraduate courses in public policy. Admissions requirements, including standardized testing requirements, vary widely. Some schools have a second language requirement due to their global orientation.The Monterey Institute Language Proficiency Requirement In the United States, applicants must have graduated from an accredited university and are generally required to take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). Many schools also accept the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) or the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) in lieu of the GRE.

Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University has a more political science and leadership based approach. The Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs provides traditional public policy training with multidisciplinary concentrations available in the environmental sciences and nonprofit management. Moreover, the University of Illinois at Chicago offers public policy training that emphasizes the stages of decision-making in formulating policy (e.g. agenda setting), as well as the importance of framing effects and cognitive limits in policy formation.

It decreases vascular resistance and increases arterial blood flow in the brain, improving the utilization of oxygen and glucose by brain cells. It has similar vasoactive properties in other areas of the body, particularly the lungs. Unlike many other ergolines, such as ergotamine, nicergoline is not associated with fibrosis It is used for vascular disorders such as cerebral thrombosis and atherosclerosis, arterial blockages in the limbs, Raynaud's disease, vascular migraines, and retinopathy. Nicergoline has been registered in over fifty countries and has been used for more than three decades for the treatment of cognitive, affective, and behavioral disorders of older people.  Clinical uses  Nicerogline is used in the following cases: *Acute and chronic cerebral metabolic-vascular disorders (cerebral arteriosclerosis, thrombosis and cerebral embolism, transitory cerebral ischaemia). Acute and chronic peripheral metabolic-vascular disorders (organic and functional arteriopathies of the limbs), Raynaud‚Äôs disease and other syndromes caused by altered peripheral irrigation. *Migraines of vascular origin *Coadjutant therapy in clinical situations accompanied by platelet hyper-aggregability, arterial tension. *Corio-retinal vascular disorders: diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration and retinal angiosclerosis *Oto-vestibular problems of a vascular nature: dizziness, auditory hallucinations, hypoacusis. Dosages for known conditions are usually administered at 5‚Äì10 mg three times a day, however anti-aging preventative purposes may want to consider 5 mg once or twice a day more adequate.Nicergoline drug insert, Pharmacia & Upjohn, October 2000 =As a nootropic= Nicergoline displays positive effects on aspects of human cognitive performance, including concentration, psychomotor performance, attention, reaction times, and other indicators of brain function.  Contraindications  Persons suffering from acute bleeding, myocardial infarction (heart conditions), hypertension, bradycardia or using alpha or beta receptor agonists should consult with their physician before use. Although toxicology studies have not shown nicergoline to have any teratogenic effect, the use of this medicine during pregnancy should be limited to those cases where it is absolutely necessary. On 28 June 2013 the European Medicines Agency recommended restricting the use of medicines containing ergot derivatives, including nicergoline. They stated that \\"these medicines should no longer be used to treat several conditions involving blood circulation problems or problems with memory and sensation, or to prevent migraine headaches, since the risks are greater than the benefits in these indications. This is based on a review of data showing an increased risk of fibrosis (formation of excess connective tissue that can damage organs and body structures) and ergotism (symptoms of ergot poisoning, such as spasms and obstructed blood circulation) with these medicines.\\" However, only a subset of ergolines are associated with fibrosis and evidence suggests that nicergoline does not carry fibrotic risk like other ergoline derivatives such as ergotamine. Nicergoline is considered unsafe in porphyria.  Adverse effects  The side effects of nicergoline are usually limited to nausea, hot flushes, mild gastric upset, hypotension and dizziness. At high drug dosages, bradycardia, increased appetite, agitation, diarrhea and perspiration were reported. Most of the available literature suggests that the side effects of nicergoline are mild and transient.  Interactions  Nicergoline is known to enhance the cardiac depressive effects of propranolol. At high dosages, it is advisable to seek one‚Äôs physician's guidance if combining with potent vasodilators such as bromocriptine, Ginkgo biloba, picamilon, vinpocetine or xantinol nicotinate.  Mechanism of action  Nicergoline is an ergot alkaloid derivative that acts as a potent and selective alpha-1A adrenergic receptor antagonist. The IC50 of nicergoline in vitro has been reported to be 0.2 nM. The primary action of nicergoline is to increase arterial blood flow by vasodilation. Furthermore, it is known that nicergoline inhibits platelet aggregation. Studies have shown that nicergoline also increases nerve growth factor in the aged brain.

(1998), The Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War, New York: Oxford University Press, p. 250 It was a combined mission of the United States Army, Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), and Republic of Korea Army (ROK) in B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province on the central coast of South Vietnam. The People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 3rd Division, made up of two regiments of North Vietnamese regulars and one regiment of main force Viet Cong (VC) guerrillas, controlled much of the land and many of the people of B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province, which had a total population of about 800,000. A CIA report in 1965 said that Binh Dinh was \\"just about lost\\" to the communists. The name \\"Operation Masher\\" was changed to \\"Operation White Wing\\", because President Lyndon Johnson wanted the name changed to one that sounded more benign. Adjacent to the operational area of Masher/White Wing in Quang Ngai province the U.S. and South Vietnamese Marine Corps carried out a complementary mission called Operation Double Eagle. The 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) was the principal U.S. ground force involved in Operation Masher and that operation was marked as a success by its commanders. Claims are made that the PAVN 3rd Division had been dealt a hard blow, but intelligence reports indicated that a week after the withdrawal of the 1st Cavalry PAVN soldiers were returning to take control of the area where Operation Masher had taken place. Most of the PAVN/VC had slipped away prior to or during the operation, and discrepancy between weapons recovered and body count led to criticisms of the operation. Allegations that there were a reported six civilian casualties for every reported PAVN/VC casualty during the Fulbright Hearings prompted growing criticism of US conduct of the war and contributed to greater public dissension at home. During Operation Masher, the ROK Capital Division were alleged to have committed the B√¨nh An/T√¢y Vinh massacre on 26 February 1966. The operation would create almost 125,000 homeless people in this province, and the PAVN/VC forces would reappear just months after the US had conducted the operation. Background B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province was a traditional communist and VC stronghold. Binh Dinh consisted of a narrow, heavily cultivated coastal plain with river valleys separated by ridges and low mountains reaching into the interior. The main effort of the campaign in Binh Dinh would come on the Bong Son Plain and in the mountains and valleys that bordered it. The plain, a narrow strip of land starting just north of the town of B·ªìng S∆°n, ran northward along the coast into I Corps. Rarely more than 25 km wide, it consisted of a series of small deltas, which often backed into gently rolling terraces some 30-90m in height, and, at irregular intervals, of a number of mountainous spurs from the highlands. These spurs created narrow river valleys with steep ridges that frequently provided hideouts for PAVN/VC units or housed PAVN/VC command, control and logistical centers. The plain itself was bisected by the east-west Lai Giang River, which was in turn fed by two others, the An Lao, flowing from the northwest and the Kim Son, flowing from the southwest. These two rivers formed isolated but fertile valleys west of the coastal plain. The climate in the region was governed by the northeast monsoon. The heaviest rains had usually ended by December, but a light steady drizzle, which the French had called crachin weather and occasional torrential downpours could be expected to occur through March. These weather systems would at time limits the availability of air support. The vital artery of Highway 1 ran north and south ran through Binh Dinh. The area of Operation Masher was about north to south and reached a maximum of inland from the South China Sea. The U.S. Marine's Operation Double Eagle extended northward from Masher and the ROK's Operation Flying Tiger extended southward. South Vietnamese forces participated in all three operations. The First Cavalry Division (Airmobile) was selected by U.S. Commander William Westmoreland to carry out the operation. The 1st Cavalry had borne the brunt of the combat during the Siege of Plei Me and the Battle of Ia Drang in October and November 1965, and some battalions of the 1st Cavalry had sustained heavy casualties. More than 5,000 soldiers in the division were recent arrivals in Vietnam with little combat experience. The South Vietnamese 22nd Division stationed in Binh Dinh had also suffered heavy casualties in recent fighting and was on the defensive. The opposition to the American and South Vietnamese units participating in Operation Masher/White Wing was the PAVN 3rd Division consisting of approximately 6,000 soldiers in two regiments of PAVN regulars who had a recently infiltrated into South Vietnam via the Ho Chi Minh Trail and one regiment of VC guerrillas who had been fighting the South Vietnamese government since 1962. The majority of the population of Binh Dinh was believed to be supportive of the VC. The plan of Operation Masher was for the U.S., South Vietnamese and ROK soldiers to sweep north and for the U.S. and South Vietnamese marines to sweep south catching and killing the PAVN/VC forces between the allied forces. Orders for the U.S. forces in Operation Masher were to \\"locate and destroy VC/NVA units; enhance the security of GVN [Government of South Vietnam] installations in [provincial capital] Bong Song, and to lay the groundwork for restoration of GVN control of the population and rich coastal plain area.\\" The primary metric for judging the success of the operation would be the body count of PAVN/VC soldiers killed. Preparations The 1st Cavalry Division broke the campaign into two parts. During the first, primarily a preparation and deception operation, a brigade-size task force would establish a temporary command and forward supply base at Phu Cat on Highway 1 south of the area of operations, secure the highway somewhat northward, and start patrolling around Phu Cat to convey the impression that the true target area was well away from the plain. During the second, division elements would move to Bong Son itself and launch a series of airmobile hammer-and-anvil operations around the plain and the adjacent valleys to flush the PAVN/VC toward strong blocking positions. General Harry Kinnard assigned the mission to Colonel Hal Moore's 3rd Brigade, but if need be, he was ready to add a second brigade to the operation to intensify the pressure and pursuit. 1st Cavalry Division deploys, 25 January On the morning of 25 January the men of the 3rd Brigade at Camp Radcliff began their move to staging areas in eastern Binh Dinh. Two battalions, Lieutenant colonel Raymond L. Kampe's 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment and Lt. Col. Rutland D. Beard's 1st Battalion, 12th Cavalry Regiment went by road and air to Phu Cat, joined South Koreans in securing the airfield and support base, and carried out wide- ranging search and destroy actions nearby that met only light resistance. Meanwhile, Lt. Col. Robert McDade's 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, with about 80 percent of its authorized strength and thus still not fully reconstituted after the fight at LZ Albany, boarded a dozen C-123s at the airstrip for the short ride into Bong Son. One of the C-123s crashed into mountains near An Khe, killing all 4 crewmen and 42 passengers on board. The rest of the battalion deployed without incident and then helicoptered north to Landing Zone Dog, where engineers started building an airstrip and digging in artillery. On paper, the hammer-and-anvil attack plan was not complicated. After 3rd Brigade elements secured mountain positions west of the Bong Son and set up Firebases Brass and Steel, covering the northern and southern parts of the search area, 2/7th Cavalry would push north from LZ Dog and 2/12th Cavalry, also staging from LZ Dog, would work its way south from the opposite end of the target zone. Meanwhile, with the South Vietnamese Airborne Brigade acting as an eastern blocking force along Highway 1, 1/7th Cavalry would air- assault onto the high ground to the west and push east towards 2/7th Cavalry and 2/12th Cavalry. If PAVN/VC units were in the area, the 3rd Brigade would bring them to battle or destroy them as they fled. The operation A landing zone for American troops north of Bong Son =Phase One: Bong Son= Troops of Company \\"C\\", 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment engage a VC bunker Operation Masher began officially on the morning of 28 January 1966, low clouds, wind and heavy rain prevented the movement of artillery to Firebase Brass. Lacking supporting fire, Moore cancelled the 2/12th Cavalry's mission. In the meantime, PAVN/VC fire downed a CH-47 helicopter at Landing Zone Papa north of Bong Son and Kampe responded by sending a 1/7th Cavalry company to secure the crash site. When it too came under fire, he set aside his original mission, the attack east from the mountains and moved his two other companies to LZ Papa. By the time they arrived, however, the PAVN/VC had withdrawn. Kampe's units spent the night at the landing zone. McDade went ahead with the mission, directing his men to begin scouring the hamlets that started about 2 km north of LZ Dog and extended 4 km further up the plain. Company A, 2/7th Cavalry understrength at two rifle platoons because of the crash three days earlier, entered the area at Landing Zone 2 and pushed north through rice paddies. Company B flew to Firebase Steel to secure it for an artillery battery. Company C deployed by helicopter to the northern edge of the target in order to sweep to the southwest. The sandy plain where it set down, Landing Zone 4, () seemed safe, a relatively open tract in the hamlet of Phung Du 2 with a graveyard in its midst and tall palm trees on three sides. Company C omitted the artillery preparation that normally preceded a landing due to the proximity of the village. The first helicopter lift landed at LZ 4 at 08:25, with no PAVN/VC reaction. When the second lift came ten minutes later however, the PAVN 7th Battalion, 22nd Regiment, entrenched in earthworks, palm groves and bamboo thickets throughout the hamlet, poured mortar and machine gun fire into the landing zone. Company C commander, Captain Fesmire waved the second flight away, expecting the troops to be dropped at an alternative landing zone a few hundred meters to the southwest. Instead, they ended up at four nearby but scattered locations. Returning ten minutes later with a third lift, the helicopters unloaded the men at a fifth site. By 08:45 Company C was on the ground, but the unit was so fragmented and enemy fire so intense that the various parts found maneuver difficult and effective communication with one another impossible. Meanwhile, heavy rain impeded the provision of adequate air support, and the men were so dispersed that artillery was of little use. American casualties soon littered the hamlet ground. 1st Cavalry troops deploy from a CH-47 onto LZ 5, 3 February McDade ordered Company A to reinforce Company C but when they reached the southern edge of the landing zone, they also came under fire. Although the men formed a perimeter near a paddy dike, they were soon pinned down and never reached Company C. Early in the afternoon McDade joined Company A, but to no effect. Finally, six helicopters carrying reinforcements from Company B reached LZ 4. But the effort generated so much PAVN fire that all six were hit and two were driven off. Only the command group and part of one platoon were able to land and they quickly found themselves in a cross fire. Under heavy rain McDade managed to locate the fragmented Company C and succeeded in bringing in artillery support. Meanwhile, the darkness and poor weather gave Fesmire the cover he needed to pull Company C together. As he prepared to settle in for the night, he received orders from McDade to move south, closer to the rest of the battalion. Under heavy fire, he completed the linkup at 04:30 (). Along with 20 wounded, his men carried with them the bodies of 8 killed. After dawn on 29 January the low overcast lifted, and fighter-bombers pounded the area to McDade's north, detonating PAVN ammunition and causing large fires. Soon after, McDade's companies, reinforced by 2/12th Cavalry, swept north to eliminate the last PAVN from the hamlet. But the clearing operation took another day, and was completed only when elements of 1/7th Cavalry joined the sweep out of the landing zone. From then on combat tapered off and General Kinnard ordered an end to that phase of the operation, effective at 12:00 on 4 February. The 3rd Brigade had cleared elements of the 22nd Regiment from the coastal plain claiming 566 PAVN/VC killed. US losses were 123 dead (including the 42 troops and 4 crew killed in the C-123 crash) and 2 helicopters were shot down and 29 damaged. =Phase Two: An Lao valley= On 28 January three Project DELTA U.S. Special Forces teams consisting of 17 personnel were inserted in the An Lao Valley for reconnaissance. The teams ran into immediate trouble and when rescued a day later 7 had been killed and 3 wounded. Project DELTA Commander Major Charles Beckwith was seriously wounded while extracting the teams. the 1st Cavalry was unable to provide support due to the fight at LZ 4. Beckwith was criticized for going into the An Lao valley, under VC control for 15 years, without South Vietnamese counterparts and ground intelligence and in poor weather. The An Lao Valley and the surrounding highlands were the next target of the 1st Cavalry. Kinnard believed that the headquarters of the PAVN 3rd Division were located there. Bad weather delayed the beginning of the operation to 6 February. The U.S. Marines blocked the northern entrance of the valley, the ARVN blocked the southern entrance, and three battalions were landed in the valley, however the PAVN/VC forces had withdrawn. The 1st Cavalry discovered large caches of rice and defensive works, but reported killing only 11 PAVN/VC soldiers at a loss to American forces of 49 wounded. The U.S. offered to assist the inhabitants in the An Lao valley to leave the valley and escape from PAVN/VC rule and 4,500 of 8,000 occupants did so. The U.S. reported that 3,000 people were moved by U.S. helicopter, the others leaving the valley on foot. =Phase Three: Kim Son Valley= The Kim Son Valley consisted of seven small river valleys about southwest of Bong Son. Three American battalions were deployed to the valley. On 11 February the 1st Cavalry established ambush positions in the highlands at the exits to each of the valleys and on 12 February began a sweep up the valley and outward, hoping to catch the PAVN/VC as they retreated. Initially unsuccessful, over the next few days the number of enemy dead slowly mounted as the result of over a dozen clashes with the Americans. On the morning of 15 February a platoon from Company B, 2/7th Cavalry, came under small-arms and mortar fire while patrolling about 4 km southeast of Firebase Bird, near the valley center. Captain Diduryk, the company commander, initially estimated that the opposing force was no larger than a reinforced platoon, but it soon became apparent that he had bumped into at least two companies occupying a 300m long position running along a jungled streambank and up a hillside. Intelligence later identified the force as part of the VC 93rd Battalion, 2nd Regiment. Fire from Company B's mortar platoon, from helicopter gunships and Skyraiders, and from artillery at Firebase Bird pounded the PAVN, then Diduryk's men attacked. One platoon fixed bayonets and charged the dug-in defenders across the stream. A second pushed north to block an escape route, and a third stayed in reserve. Unnerved by the frontal assault, the VC retreated in disorder. Many stumbled into the open and were quickly killed. Those who survived fled to the north, where they came within range of the waiting platoon. A smaller group attempted to escape southward but came under fire from the reserve platoon, which took many prisoners, including 93rd Battalion commander Lt. Col. Dong Doan who inadvertently provided his interrogators with enough information to identify the locations of both his regiment and its headquarters. During the fight Company B killed 59 VC and possibly another 90 for the loss of 2 killed. On 16 February Kinnard decided to replace Colonel Moore's brigade with Col. Elvy B. Roberts' 1st Brigade. The next day, the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 7th Cavalry, returned to Camp Radcliff, while 1/12th Cavalry remained behind to join 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment and 2/8th Cavalry. Together, the three battalions combed the area around Firebase Bird, but the PAVN/VC remained in hiding. Frustrated, on 22 February Roberts changed the direction of the hunt, dispatching 1/12th Cavalry to search Go Chai Mountain, 14 km east of Bird and 7 km west of Highway 1. During the afternoon of 23 February 1/12th Cavalry met an estimated PAVN company, probably from the 7th Battalion, 12th Regiment. They maintained contact until dark, but then the PAVN escaped. Operations in the area continued until the 27th, but when nothing more of substance occurred, Kinnard decided to abandon the Kim Son Valley. That evening he attached two battalions from 1st Brigade to 2nd Brigade and returned the 1st's command group and 1/12th Cavalry to Camp Radcliff. In all, the 1st Brigade had accounted for up to 160 PAVN/VC killed while losing 29 of its own men. LZ Pony, 29 April 1967 While the 1st and 3rd Brigades were patrolling the Kim Son Valley between 11 and 27 February, Colonel William R. Lynch's 2nd Brigade closed down operations north of the Lai Giang and transferred his command post to Landing Zone Pony just east of the valley. The move was triggered by Colonel Doan's revelation that the 2nd Regiment was operating in the mountains southeast of Pony, information that seemed to be confirmed when radio intercepts indicated the presence of a major PAVN/VC headquarters there. On 16 February Lynch began a block and sweep of the suspected terrain. Lt Col. Meyer's 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment, set up three blocking positions: Recoil, roughly 6 km east of the Kim Son Valley; Joe, 4 km southwest of Recoil; and Mike, just over 2 km north of Recoil. The sweep force, 1/5th Cavalry, plus a battery of the 1st Battalion, 77th Artillery Regiment, helicoptered to Landing Zone Coil approximately 6 km northeast of Recoil. 2/12th Cavalry remained near Pony as a reserve. At 06:30, on 17 February, the battery at Coil began pounding the area between Coil and Recoil. As the barrage lifted, two companies of 1/5th Cavalry moved off towards the three blocking positions. One of the companies moved out to establish a fourth blocking position east of Recoil, but before the men had gone more than a kilometer they were engulfed by fire from upslope. After calling in air strikes and artillery, Meyer directed one of his rifle companies to reinforce, but on its way it became so heavily engaged that it could not advance. Meyer then committed his third rifle company, and Colonel Lynch ordered 2/12th Cavalry to send a company as well. In the end, the cumulative weight of the American ground attack and the artillery and air strikes drove the VC from the heights, killing at least 127 VC and captured and destroyed 3 mortars, 5 recoilless rifles, and a quantity of ammunition, leading Lynch to conclude that he had crushed the 2nd Regiment's heavy weapons battalion. During the early afternoon of 18 February two platoons from Lt. Col. Ackerson's 1/5th Cavalry came under heavy fire while patrolling. With the platoons pinned down, Ackerson reinforced with two rifle companies, but fire from earthworks cut them apart, and casualties were left where they fell. At the end of the day the Americans broke contact to retrieve their dead and wounded. The troops labeled the sector where the roughest fighting had taken place the \\"Iron Triangle\\", because of its shape (not to be confused with the better-known Iron Triangle near Saigon). The fighting continued on the 19th. Company B, 2/12th Cavalry joined Company C, 2/5th Cavalry on a sweep southwest of the Iron Triangle. When one of the companies drew fire in the morning, the other attempted to turn the enemy's flank but ran into more VC. After breaking contact and calling in artillery and air strikes, the two companies attacked, killing 36 VC and forcing the remainder to withdraw. 1/5th Cavalry, meanwhile, renewed its assault into the triangle, with two companies moving west while the third blocked. But the VC stood their ground, stalling the advance. At dark, the 1/5th Cavalry broke contact to remove their wounded. The next day, 20 February, Lynch ordered Ackerson to continue his attack. Following a morning artillery strike, one of the companies came under fire from a strongpoint no more than 100m from the scene of the previous day's fighting. The Americans pulled back and called in artillery. In the afternoon a 2/12th Cavalry unit fought a running battle that left 23 VC dead before the VC withdrew. On 21 February, attacks and counterthrusts were carried out by both sides. 2/4th Cavalry and 2/12th Cavalry patrolled around their landing zones, while a platoon from 1/5th Cavalry probed the site of the previous day's combat. Once again, intense VC fire forced the Americans to withdraw. Then, having arranged for air support, Lynch pulled all of his units out of the Iron Triangle. B-52s struck the site at midmorning and again in the afternoon. A tactical air mission then dropped 300 Tear gas grenades into the area. As evening approached, two companies of 1/5th Cavalry advanced toward the triangle but stopped before entering it when darkness fell. Artillery fired over 700 rounds into the redoubt and an AC-47 gunship dropped illumination flares throughout the night. During the action a psychological operations team circled overhead in a loudspeaker plane, broadcasting the message that further resistance would be futile and dropping safe conduct passes. On 22 February, 1/5th Cavalry moved in to find bunkers, foxholes, and trenches, but no live enemy. Although 41 bodies remained at the site, blood trails, bloody bandages and discarded weapons indicated that many more had been killed or wounded. Colonel Lynch insisted that the operation would have been even more successful if the two B-52 strikes had been timed more closely together. Instead, the delay between the first and the second bombing runs had prevented mopping up operations that might have kept more of the VC from escaping. During the fight in the Iron Triangle American ground and air forces had killed at least 313 VC and possibly 400 more. The Americans also estimated that the VC had suffered some 900 wounded. Following the operation, one report observed, the entire valley floor reeked with the smell of VC dead. In addition to decimating the heavy weapons battalion of the 2nd Regiment, Colonel Lynch believed that his units had inflicted heavy losses on the Regiment's headquarters and its 93rd and 95th Battalions. The cost to the 2nd Brigade was 23 killed and 106 wounded. Colonel Lynch's brigade rested for a few days before resuming operations on 25 February. Over the next three days his men exchanged fire with small groups of PAVN/VC but failed to generate significant contacts. Early in the morning of 28 February a patrol from Company B, 1/5th Cavalry came under sniper fire less than 2 km south of Pony. Unable to locate the sniper position, the patrol members continued their advance. Entering the hamlet of Tan Thanh 2, they met a hail of fire and suffered 4 wounded. As they pushed deeper into the settlement, automatic weapons opened up on them. They responded with grenades and small arms but soon came under attack on the right flank by 15-20 VC, who killed 8 of them within minutes and wounded a number more. As the Americans scrambled for cover, the VC emerged from hiding to strip the U.S. dead of their weapons. A relief force arrived a short while later but by then the VC were gone. =Phase Four: Cay Giap mountains= Based on prisoner interrogations, American intelligence believed that the PAVN 6th Battalion, 12th Regiment was operating in the Cay Giep Mountains east of Bong Son. General Kinnard wanted to encircle and annihilate it. The ARVN 22nd Division surrounded the target area, deploying along the Lai Giang to the north, Highway 1 to the west, and the Tra O Marsh in the south, while the division's junk fleet patrolled the coast to prevent escape by sea. Colonel Lynch's 2d Brigade would conduct the attack. At 07:30 on 1 March an intense hour-long air, land and sea bombardment of intended landing zones began. When the firing stopped, the designated sweep force 2/5th Cavalry, 1/8th Cavalry and 2/8th Cavalry came in over the mountains. However the assault forces found that the bombardment had hardly dented the thick foliage, and the helicopters were unable to land. Eventually, additional air strikes opened holes in the jungle canopy wide enough to allow the men to reach the ground by scrambling down rope ladders suspended from the hovering helicopters. Once deployed, the three battalions, soon joined by 1/5th Cavalry, searched the area and found little, although an ARVN unit near the Tra O Marsh killed about 50 PAVN who were attempting to flee the dragnet. On 4 March, following word from South Vietnamese civilians that most of the PAVN had left the a rea around the end of February, Kinnard decided that the operation had run its course and over the next two days returned the 2nd Brigade to Camp Radcliff. Operation Double Eagle Company F, 2/4 Marines pass an LVT-5 during Operation Double Eagle Operation Double Eagle, carried out by U.S. and South Vietnamese marines, was a complementary mission to Operation Masher in neighboring Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Province adjoining Binh Dinh province to the north. Operation Double Eagle was carried out over an area of about about north to south and extending as much as inland from the South China Sea. 6,000 regular troops and 600 guerrillas were believed to be operating within this area. U.S. Marines dedicated to the operation would number more than 5,000 plus several thousand South Vietnamese soldiers of the ARVN 2nd Division. Operation Double Eagle began on 28 January with the largest amphibious assault of the Vietnam War and the largest since the Korean War. Bad weather hampered the early days of the operation, but the Marines pushed slowly inland. The plan was for the Marines to push southward into Binh Dinh province where they would meet the 1st Cavalry advancing northward in Operation Masher, trapping PAVN/VC forces between them. In reality, the Marines found few PAVN/VC soldiers in their operating area, the main force PAVN regiments having withdrawn from the area a few days prior to the amphibious landing. The Marines claimed to have killed 312 PAVN/VC soldiers and captured 19 at a loss of 24 Marines killed. Marine Corps Commandant General Victor Krulak later said that Operation Double Eagle had failed because the PAVN and VC had been forewarned. He also said that Operation Double Eagle was a failure because it showed the people of the region that the Marines \\"would come in, comb the area and disappear; whereupon the VC would resurface and resume control.\\" Refugees Operation Masher was carried out in heavily populated rural areas. The fighting resulted in the displacement, voluntary or involuntary, of a large number of people. The 1st Cavalry listed as a success of the operation that \\"140,000 Vietnamese civilians volunteered to leave their hamlets in the An Lao and Son Long valleys to return to GVN control.\\" The \\"voluntary\\" nature of the departure or flight of many of the civilians from their land is questionable. Operation Masher demonstrated that a consequence of large unit military operations and heavy utilization of artillery and aerial bombardment was the generation of refugees from the fighting and, inevitably, civilian casualties. The U.S. evacuated thousands of civilians by helicopter from combat areas and more thousands walked out to safety in the larger towns near the coast. The 1st Cavalry counted more than 27,000 people displaced by the operation. While many people fled the fighting, others remained for fear that if they abandoned their homes, the VC would confiscate their land and redistribute it to more dedicated supporters. Although the U.S. Army maintained that the refugees were fleeing communism, an Army study in mid-1966 concluded that U.S. and South Vietnamese bombing and artillery fire, in conjunction with ground operations, were the immediate and prime causes of refugee movement into South Vietnamese government controlled cities and coastal areas. The U.S. considered that meeting the humanitarian needs of refugees was the responsibility of South Vietnam, but the response of the South Vietnamese government was often deficient. An American journalist visited a camp housing 6,000 refugees from Operation Masher a week after their displacement. He found them packed 30 to a room, receiving inadequate food and medical treatment for diseases and wounds, and in a sullen and depressed mood. Assessment Operation Masher-White Wing was considered a success by the Americans, demonstrating the capability of the helicopter-borne 1st Cavalry to conduct a sustained campaign against PAVN and VC forces and \\"to find, fix, and finish\\" the enemy. The U.S., as it had in the earlier Battle of Ia Drang, relied on the massive use of firepower. 171 B-52 strikes hit suspected PAVN/VC positions and 132,000 artillery rounds were expended‚Äî100 for each PAVN/VC soldier killed. In addition, tactical air support was provided by 600 sorties by fixed-wing aircraft. 228 1st Cavalry soldiers were killed and another 46 died in an airplane crash; 834 were wounded. 24 U.S. Marines were killed and 156 wounded in Operation Double Eagle and several additional Americans from other units were killed. 11 ROK were reported killed; South Vietnamese casualties are not known. The U.S. claimed to have killed 1,342 PAVN/VC. The ARVN and ROK forces reported they had killed an additional 808 PAVN/VC. Further claims of 300-600 PAVN/VC were taken prisoner and 500 defected and an additional 1,746 were estimated killed. 52 crew-served weapons and 202 individual weapons were captured or recovered. An unknown number of people killed were civilians, and under the standard operating rules at the time those who did not 'voluntarily' leave free-fire zone were generally regarded as VC. Total number of civilians killed are largely unknown, but estimates are that 6 civilians were killed for every VC, with indiscriminate firepower distinctions between enemy combatants and non- combatants oftentimes were not made. These issues were raised in the Fulbright Hearings. ROK troops of the Capital Division were alleged to have killed civilians in the B√¨nh An/T√¢y Vinh massacre. Despite this operation being the biggest search-and-destroy operation in the war up to that point, most of the PAVN/VC forces had slipped away and re-appeared in the region a few months later. An estimated 125,000 people within the Binh Dinh province had lost their homes as a result of Operation Masher/White Wing. The positive results cited by the Americans appear to have been only transitory. The 1st Cavalry cited among the favorable consequences of Operation Masher that it had give the local population \\"a chance to be freed from VC domination by moving to areas which are under government control\\" and stated that the South Vietnamese government \\"intends to reestablish civil government in the area.\\" PAVN/VC influence, however, continued to be extensive in Binh Dinh province. Two months later, in Operation Crazy Horse, the 1st Cavalry was back sweeping part of the same area covered by Operation Masher and in October 1966 Operation Thayer began an extended effort by the 1st Cavalry once again to \\"fully pacify\\" Binh Dinh province. A Joint Chiefs of Staff memo reported by The Wall Street Journal in 1966 urged President Johnson to \\"expand\\" the use of non- lethal chemicals in South Vietnam. The use of 3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate or Agent BZ was alleged in Operation White Wing by journalist Pierre Darcourt in L'Express news magazine. The allegation concerned an offensive and the 1st Cavalry Division in March 1966 during Operation \\"White Wing.\\"BZ (3-quinuclidinyl benzillate) The Wednesday Report.

It was created by Hugo d'Alesi (fr), a painter of advertising posters, and was a combination of moving panoramic paintings and a large motion platform. It is regarded as one of the last major developments in the technology of panoramas, shortly before the medium became obsolete.  Development  Between 1892 and 1900, many attractions were successful for the first time in the form of pantomimes lumineuses. For instance, in 1894, people could see moving photographs in Thomas Edison's kinetoscope and, starting in December 1895, they could see the first Lumi√®re brothers' films. Seeing the success that it had generated, many entrepreneurs tried to incorporate moving images into their already existing amusements, because the recreational qualities of the moving images by themselves were not totally appreciable. So, instead of thinking that the images in movement threatened the panoramas of that time, entrepreneurs initially incorporated films on their panoramic screens with great enthusiasm.  Functioning  Exhibited at the Paris Exposition in 1900, the attraction was located inside a building in the amusement section, on the Champ de Mars. The Mareorama simultaneously developed two panoramas in motion to the delight of the spectators, who placed themselves among them to create the illusion of being on the deck of a ship. The two paintings were continuous images of the sea and shoreline from the trip. They were each 750 m (2,460 ft) long and 13 m (42.5 ft) tall. To create them, d'Alesi sketched the highlights from a year- long trip he took between Marseille and Yokohama. He then directed a large team of decorative and scene painters for eight months, to transfer the sketches onto the 20,000 m¬≤ (215,000 square feet) of canvas. Mounted on large cylinders supported by floats, and driven by hydraulic motors, the two canvases unrolled past the spectators over the course of the simulated journey. The upper edge of each canvas was hooked to small trolleys on a rail and reinforced with a thin steel band to prevent sagging. The cylinders themselves were concealed by curtains and props. Spectators stood on a platform which represented the deck of a steamship, complete with smoking funnels and steam whistles. In order to give it a rolling and pitching motion, it was mounted on a 5 m (16 ft) square iron frame on a gimbal. A combination of hydraulic cylinders, chains, and electric motors allowed the platform to pitch by up to 50 cm (20 inches) from horizontal, and to roll by up to 20 cm (8 inches). The realism of the attraction derives both from the theme they represent and from the technology that puts passengers in the middle of things and the simulated movement. There was even a Mareorama that lasted half an hour and accommodated seven hundred spectators at a time, which offered a plausible itinerary to several ports. Among these we find a simulated voyage from Marseille to Yokohama, passing by Algiers, Naples, Istanbul, the Suez Canal, Sri Lanka, and Singapore. It was a sensory journey both in time and space. Mareorama, in that way, turned the spectators into \\"passengers\\" of a ship, since it simulated the emotion of traveling by sea with moving images, by consisting of a 70 m (230 ft) long replica of a steamship and 2 panoramas (one for the port side, one for the starboard) on large rollers.  Optical illusion and reproduced sensation  The sensation of approach and detachment is experienced in an effect of the kinematic telescope: the physical limit of the city, on the edge of the sea, becomes a frame that widens. An open visual space. The views of a city that follow the course of a river that traverses its architecture also provide a cinematic diversity of perspective and movement: a first view of the city from a distance, then it gets closer to your heart and, finally, it moves away. In the words of architectural historian Renzo Dubbini, as one moves with the flow of the current, \\"the view is regulated by a continuous flow of images that changes constantly. The observation point moves along a succession of the innumerable points of view that make up a geographical route \\". The different scenarios reproduced reality in different ways. Whether relying on the optical illusions generated by the spectators, making references to other realistic genres such as the wax museum, or mechanically simulating the movement with a motion platform. Or whereas, juxtaposing multiple forms by accumulation, such as painted panoramas, moving images or live performances. In order to add to the illusion of a sea voyage, fans created an ocean breeze, which whistled in the rigging. Lighting effects created day- and night-time, as well as flashes of lightning. There were also sounds of the ship's screw and the steam siren. Seaweed and tar provided an olfactory element of the simulation. Overall, the whole experience was complemented by actors portraying deck hands, rushing about, \\"ostensibly to help anyone who may suffer from mal de mer\\". Finally, to impact in all senses at once and obtain the most realistic effect possible, they also presented a symphony played by an orchestra that could not be seen while the images were represented in the Mareorama. In this way, the sensorial direction of the panorama was multiplied. This is how a technological march towards an increasingly perfectly realistic reproduction was created and eventually, towards the invention of cinema. However, having said that, in the end the cinema ended up eclipsing the popularity of the panoramas in the early years of the 20th century.

The International Typographic Style has had profound influence on graphic design as a part of the modernist movement, impacting many design-related fields including architecture and art. It emphasizes cleanness, readability, and objectivity.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, International Typographic Style Hallmarks of the style are asymmetric layouts, use of a grid, sans-serif typefaces like Akzidenz Grotesk, and flush left, ragged right text. The style is also associated with a preference for photography in place of illustrations or drawings. Many of the early International Typographic Style works featured typography as a primary design element in addition to its use in text, and it is for this that the style is named.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Arts & Entertainment: graphic design, THE INTERNATIONAL TYPOGRAPHIC STYLE The influences of this graphic movement can still be seen in design strategy and theory to this day. History A 1969 Swiss poster in International Typographic Style A 1959 Swiss poster The style emerged from a desire to represent information objectively, free from the influence of associated meaning. The International Typographic Style evolved as a modernist graphic movement that sought to convey messages clearly and in a universally straightforward manner. Two major Swiss design schools are responsible for the early years of International Typographic Style. A graphic design technique based on grid-work that began in the 19th century became inspiration for modifying the foundational course at the Basel School of Design in 1908. Shortly thereafter, in 1918 Ernst Keller became a professor at the Kunstgewerbeschule Z√ºrich and began developing a graphic design and typography course. He did not teach a specific style to his students, rather he taught a philosophy of style that dictated \\"the solution to the design problem should emerge from its content.\\" This idea of the solution to the design emerging from the problem itself was a reaction to previous artistic processes focused on \\"beauty for the sake of beauty\\" or \\"the creation of beauty as a purpose in and of itself\\". Keller's work uses simple geometric forms, vibrant colors and evocative imagery to further elucidate the meaning behind each design. Other early pioneers include Th√©o Ballmer and Max Bill. The 1950s saw the distillation of International Typographic Style elements into sans-serif font families such as Univers. Univers paved the way for Max Miedinger and collaborator Edouard Hoffman to design the typeface Neue Haas Grotesk, which would be later renamed Helvetica. The goal with Helvetica was to create a pure typeface that could be applied to longer texts and that was highly readable. The movement began to coalesce after a periodical publication began in 1959 titled New Graphic Design, which was edited by several influential designers who played major roles in the development of International Typographic Style. The format of the journal represented many of the important elements of the style‚Äîvisually demonstrating the content‚Äîand was published internationally, thus spreading the movement beyond Switzerland's borders. One of the editors, Josef M√ºller-Brockmann, \\"sought an absolute and universal form of graphic expression through objective and impersonal presentation, communicating to the audience without the interference of the designer's subjective feelings or propagandist techniques of persuasion.\\" Many of M√ºller-Brockmann's feature large photographs as objective symbols meant to convey his ideas in particularly clear and powerful ways. After World War II international trade began to increase and relations between countries grew steadily stronger. Typography and design were crucial to helping these relationships progress‚Äîclarity, objectivity, region-less glyphs, and symbols are essential to communication between international partners. International Typographic Style found its niche in this communicative climate and expanded further beyond Switzerland, to America. One of the first American designers to integrate Swiss design with his own was Rudolph de Harak. The influence of International Typographic Style on de Harak's own works can be seen in his many book jacket designs for McGraw-Hill publishers in the 1960s. Each jacket shows the book title and author, often aligned with a grid‚Äîflush left, ragged- right. One striking image covers most of the jacket, elucidating the theme of the particular book. International Typographic Style was embraced by corporations and institutions in America from the 1960s on, for almost two decades. One institution particularly devoted to the style was MIT.  Associated movements  During 1900s other design based movements were formulating, influencing and influenced by the International Typographic movement. These movements emerged within the relationships between artistic fields including architecture, literature, graphic design, painting, sculpting etc. De Stijl was a Dutch artistic movement that saw prominence in the period between 1917-1930. Referred to as neoplasticism, this artistic strategy sought to reflect a new Utopian ideal of spiritual harmony and order. It was a form of pure abstraction through reduction to the essentials of form and colour, employing vertical and horizontal layouts using only black and white and primary colors. Proponents of this movement included painters like Piet Mondrian, Vilmes Huszar and Bart van der Hoff as well as architects like Gerrit Rietveld, Robert van't Hoff and J.J.P. Oud. Bauhaus was a German-based movement that emphasized purity of geometry, absence of ornamentation and the motto 'form follows function'. This was a school of thought that combined craftsmaking with the fine arts and was founded by Walter Gropius. The goal was to work towards the essence of the form follows function relationship to facilitate a style that could be applied to all design problems; the International Style. Constructivism was an art/architectural philosophy that emerged from Russia in the 1920s. The style develops by assorted mechanical objects that are combined into abstract mobile structural forms. Hallmarks of the movement include geometric reduction, photo-montage and simplified palettes. Suprematism, which arose in 1913, is another Russian art movement similarly focused on the simplification and purity of geometric forms to speak to values of spirituality. All of these movements including the International Typographic styles are defined by reductionist purity as a visually compelling strategy of conveying messages through geometric and color based hierarchies.  Notes on theory  The Bauhaus mantra of 'form follows function' applies to design in the spirit of the International Typographic movement. The movement was structured by focusing on detail, precision, craft skill, systems of education and approach, technical training, high standards of print and the innovative application of lettering. The theory revolves around critically approaching the development of a system specific to the design problem presented. For example, a father of the style Ernst Keller argued that a design solution should always be respectful of its content. A good comparison is the structure that defines a math problem. You only use specific equations for specific types of problems. You similarly only can work through these equations in specific ways. With the International Typographic and other related philosophies, a design context is critical to deriving a response. Characteristics of style Each design done with International Typographic Style in mind begins with a mathematical grid, because a grid is the \\"most legible and harmonious means for structuring information.\\" Text is then applied, most often aligned flush left, ragged right. Fonts chosen for the text are sans serif, a type style believed to \\"[express] the spirit of a more progressive age\\" by early designers in the movement. Objective photography is another design element meant to present information clearly, and without any of the persuading influences of propaganda or commercial advertising. Such a strong focus on order and clarity is drawn from early pioneers of the movement believing that design is a \\"socially useful and important activity... the designers define their roles not as artists but as objective conduits for spreading important information between components of society.\\" See also *International style (architecture) *Helvetica *Max Bill *Adrian Frutiger *Armin Hofmann *Richard Paul Lohse *Josef M√ºller-Brockmann *Paul Rand *Emil Ruder *Jan Tschichold References  Further reading  *Fiedl, Frederich, Nicholas Ott and Bernard Stein.

She was a faculty member of Columbia University‚Äôs school of journalism as well as Barnard College, and was a winner of the Front Page Award for her journalistic achievement in writing about the Hollywood Blacklist. She died during the COVID-19 pandemic due to complications brought on by COVID-19. Early life Born Patricia Crum in Oakland, California, Bosworth was the daughter of prominent attorney Bartley Crum and novelist Anna Gertrude Bosworth. She grew up especially close to her younger brother, Bartley Crum Jr. Their father was active in politics as a confidant to Wendell Willkie during the 1940 U.S. presidential election, and served on the 1945 Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry into Palestine that advised President Harry Truman to support the creation of a Jewish state. The elder Crum gained renown for being one of the six lawyers who defended the Hollywood Ten during the Red Scare at the start of the Cold War in 1947. His career suffered during the fallout from the Blacklist, and the family moved from California to New York in late 1948. In California, Bosworth was educated at Miss Burke's School and the Convent of the Sacred Heart. At age 13, intending to become an actress, she adopted her mother's maiden name as her surname. When the family relocated to New York, Bosworth first attended the Chapin School; later, she went to the Ecole International in Geneva, Switzerland. Bosworth studied at Sarah Lawrence College, graduating in 1955 with a major in dance and writing. Career =Acting= While still a student at Sarah Lawrence, Bosworth began modeling for the John Robert Powers Agency. She was hired by Diane and Allan Arbus to pose for a magazine ad for the Greyhound bus company. Allan drove everyone, including his and Diane's assistant Tad Yamashiro (who later became an exhibited photographer himself), from Manhattan to the Ardsley Acres section of Ardsley, New York for the photo shoot. Shortly after her college graduation, Bosworth became a member of the Actors Studio in Manhattan, where she studied under master teacher Lee Strasberg.. Arthur Penn cast her as the lead in her first professional play, a pre-Broadway tryout of James Leo Herlihy‚Äôs Blue Denim, about the consequences of teenage pregnancy and abortion. Bosworth appeared in several Broadway shows during the 1950s and 1960s, including Inherit the Wind, Small War on Murray Hill (directed by Garson Kanin), and Jean Kerr's Mary, Mary (where she understudied from 1961 to 1965 before being cast as the lead for the end of the play's run). She played Elaine Stritch's sister in the drama The Sin of Pat Muldoon and a motormouthed teen based on the young Nora Ephron in Phoebe Ephron's comedy Howie. During this period Bosworth also toured in The Glass Menagerie, playing Laura to Helen Hayes's Amanda, and Remains to be Seen opposite Tommy Sands. She worked regularly on popular television series including Naked City, The Secret Storm, Young Dr. Malone, and The Patty Duke Show. Bosworth can also be seen in the film Four Boys and a Gun as James Franciscus's wife, and as a disgruntled redhead in the audience of Bert Stern‚Äôs 1960 cult documentary Jazz on a Summer's Day, about the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival. As an actress, Bosworth is perhaps best known for playing Sister Simone, the young friend of Audrey Hepburn's character Sister Luke, in The Nun's Story (1959). Directed by Fred Zinnemann, the film was a major box office success and nominated for multiple Academy Awards. In 1958, upon learning she was cast in The Nun's Story, she also learned she was pregnant. She subsequently received an abortion at an underground abortionist in Manhattan. Shortly after, she boarded a plane to Rome to meet Fred Zinnemann, where she began to hemorrhage. In Rome, she was sent to a hospital convent where she was to learn about being a nun. The nun discovered she wasn't feeling well due to the abortion and rushed her to the hospital for care. The film was delayed for her recovery. =Journalist= In the mid-1960s, Bosworth left acting to become a journalist. She gained notice as a writer with several Broadway-focused features and interviews published in New York magazine and the New York Times. Later in the decade, she became editor of Screen Stars magazine and worked at Magazine Management Company alongside Mario Puzo, who was then beginning drafts of his novel The Godfather. From 1969 to 1972 Bosworth was senior editor of McCall's; she served as managing editor of Harper's Bazaar from 1972 to 1974. Penthouse founder Bob Guccione hired Bosworth as executive editor of the erotic women's magazine Viva from 1974 to 1976. During the 1970s and 1980s, Bosworth reviewed numerous books for The New York Times, wrote freelance art pieces for the Times, Time Life, and other national magazines, and contributed a monthly column on arts and entertainment to Working Woman magazine. Bosworth was an editor at Mirabella from 1993 to 1995. She was first hired as a contributing editor at Vanity Fair in 1984, under Tina Brown‚Äôs editorship of the magazine, and served in that capacity until 1991. She continued to freelance for the magazine until 1997, when she rejoined as contributing editor under Graydon Carter‚Äôs leadership, a position she held to the end of her life. Her profile of Elia Kazan and his reflections on the Hollywood Blacklist, published in a spring 1999 issue of Vanity Fair, won Bosworth the Front Page Award from the Newswomen's Club of New York. =Author= Bosworth was the author of bestselling biographies on Montgomery Clift (1978), Diane Arbus (1984), Marlon Brando (2000) and Jane Fonda (2011). Her book, Montgomery Clift: A Biography explores how the actor's introverted approach to his craft influenced James Dean and many others. Bosworth, whose father had been Clift's lawyer in the late 1940s, had total access to Clift's family while doing research for the project. She also spoke to many of Clift's close friends and colleagues. Conversations between Bosworth and Brooks Clift appeared in Montgomery Clift's nephew documentary Making Montgomery Clift. Bosworth's biography of Arbus, a photographer known for her poetic approach to eccentric and abnormal subjects, was a nuanced appraisal of the artist that also investigated the lurid details of her life, culminating in Arbus's 1971 suicide. The book was critically acclaimed. Andrew Holleran of New York magazine said it was \\"a biography that seems to have... more than enough material for several art legends... Patricia Bosworth has created a spellbinding portrait.\\" Washington Post Book World reviewed it as \\"fascinating\\" and \\"a compelling biography... as valuable in its insights into the cultural history of the 50s and 60s as its understanding of the special place Arbus occupies in it.\\" However, the book also proved to be extremely controversial, and did not receive formal approval from the Arbus estate. Bosworth's work is still widely considered to be the definitive biography of Arbus; it was the inspiration for Steven Shainberg‚Äôs 2006 film Fur, which starred Nicole Kidman as Diane Arbus and Ty Burrell and Robert Downey Jr. as her husband and lover respectively. According to Publishers Weekly, Bosworth's biography on Marlon Brando \\"offers a vivid reminder of the personal and professional highlights of Brando's life ... [It is] an informative biography of Brando that, because of the limited format of the Penguin Lives series, hints at but cannot do justice to the great unruliness of Brando's career and life. She provides a fine, detailed sketch of his New York days when he took acting classes with Harry Belafonte, Elaine Stritch, Gene Saks, Shelley Winters, Rod Steiger and Kim Stanley, and presents a great portrait of the craziness on the set of Last Tango in Paris (co-star Maria Schneider announced that they got along 'because we're both bisexual')\\", but in only 228 pages, the author \\"can't approach the complexity of her earlier work.\\" Bosworth spent ten years completing a biography of Jane Fonda, with whom she had attended sessions at the Actors Studio in the 1950s and 60s. Fonda granted Bosworth total access; they met frequently throughout the research process for the book. Bosworth's biography, Jane Fonda: The Private Life of a Public Woman, was on the New York Times bestseller list in 2011 and was named one of Kirkus Reviews‚Äô Best Six Books of the Year. In addition to her biographies, Bosworth was the author of two memoirs. The first, Anything Your Little Heart Desires: An American Family Story, was published by Simon & Schuster in 1997. It tells the story of Bosworth's father, Bartley Crum, and how his decision to defend the Hollywood Ten at the height of McCarthyism destroyed his career, ultimately leading to his suicide. Anything was featured on the front page of the New York Times Book Review and was named a Notable Book of the Year in 1997. Following publication of this memoir, Bosworth became an active spokeswoman for suicide survivors and suicide prevention. She received the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention‚Äôs Lifesavers Award in 1998. Her book The Men in My Life: A Memoir of Love and Art in 1950s Manhattan was published by HarperCollins in 2017. It examines Bosworth's career as an actress, her early transition into journalism, and her first and second marriages, as well as how she survived the suicides of both her brother and father. In 2018, Bosworth released Dreamer With a Thousand Thrills: The Rediscovered Photographs of Tom Palumbo, published by powerHouse Books. The book features Palumbo's fashion photographs and celebrity portraits from the 1950s and 60s, as well as several works that were never published during his lifetime. Bosworth was working on her latest project, Protest Song, at the time of her death. Protest Song (Farrar, Straus, & Giroux) is about Paul Robeson's work to create federal anti-lynching legislation, which her father collaborated on, and J. Edgar Hoover's subsequent successful campaign to blacklist Robeson. Similar anti-lynching legislation to that proposed by Robeson and Crum was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on February 26, 2020. Personal life and death During Bosworth's sophomore year at Sarah Lawrence, her beloved brother Bart Jr. committed suicide at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. This event, and their father's suicide six years later in 1959, would inform Bosworth's work throughout her life. During her first year at Sarah Lawrence, Bosworth eloped with an art student. The marriage turned abusive and was annulled after sixteen months. Bosworth married novelist and playwright Mel Arrighi in 1966; the two collaborated on several projects outside of their individual work. Arrighi died due to cardiac arrest and complications from emphysema on September 17, 1986. In the late 1980s, Bosworth was reintroduced to photographer Tom Palumbo, whom she had met decades earlier when Palumbo had been on staff at Harper's Bazaar and Vogue. Palumbo was then seguing from photography into directing theatre. He and Bosworth worked on a number of plays together for the Actors Studio and Lincoln Center, including a production of The Seagull starring Laura Linney as Nina and Tammy Grimes as Arkadina. They married in 2000. Palumbo died due to complications from Lewy Body Dementia on October 13, 2008. After Palumbo's death, Bosworth joined the board of the Lewy Body Dementia Resource Center. Bosworth died on April 2, 2020, three weeks away from her 87th birthday, at Mount Sinai West hospital in New York City, due to pneumonia and complications from COVID-19.

Spun off from the Holiday Corp. in December 1989 as Promus Companies, the company became Promus Hotel Corporation in 1995 after the firm's gambling interests were spun off as Harrah's Entertainment. Promus Hotel Corp. ceased to exist after its purchase by Hilton Hotels Corporation in 1998. History Promus Hotel Corporation's beginnings are tied to the original Holiday Corp., which was based in Memphis, Tennessee. Holiday Corp. owned the Holiday Inn hotel chain, but significantly higher competition in the hotel industry and a 1987 financial restructuring that left Holiday Corp. heavily in debt prompted Holiday to sell in August 1989 its Holiday Inn chain (including Crowne Plaza) for $2.23 billion to Bass PLC, a large British brewing concern. This left Holiday Corp. with several far more profitable core gambling and hotel brands, including Harrah's Entertainment, Embassy Suites Hotels, Homewood Suites, and Hampton Inn. In December 1989, Holiday Corp. spun off its hotels as stand-alone Promus Companies. Promus Companies decided to split the gambling interests it owned from its tourist and business travel hotel chains, and in 1995 spun off its non-gambling assets to the stand-alone Promus Hotel Corporation. Promus Companies then changes its name to Harrah's Entertainment. In September 1998, Doubletree Corporation and Promus announced a merger, retaining the Promus name. Almost exactly two years later, Promus Hotel Corp. was purchased by Hilton Hotels Corporation for $3.1 billion.

New Jersey militia companies defending a bridge across Alloway Creek in Salem County, New Jersey, were lured into a trap by British Lieutenant Colonel Charles Mawhood and suffered significant casualties. Background In late 1777, British forces under the command of General William Howe occupied Philadelphia, the seat of the Second Continental Congress, and viewed by Howe as the capital of the rebellious Thirteen Colonies.Bodle, pp. 36-40 The occupation was not an easy one, as the surrounding countryside swarmed with Continental Army and Patriot militia companies as part of a campaign by George Washington against British supply lines.Bodle, pp. 54,64 The winter of 1777-1778 was particularly harsh for the Americans, but both sides regularly sent out significant forces to forage for their own side and to interfere with the foraging operations of the other side.Bodle, pp. 215-216 On February 19, with the Continental Army in desperate need of provisions, Brigadier General Anthony Wayne led a force across the Delaware River south of Philadelphia on a foraging expedition through southern New Jersey. General Howe responded by sending a force of about 4,000 men to harass Wayne. However, Wayne moved rapidly northward, gathering provisions, forcing residents to move supplies he could not take away from easy British reach, and occasionally skirmishing with the chasing British.Bodle, p. 216 Howe sent another force in March under Lieutenant Colonel Charles Mawhood to forage and also to try to force Wayne into battle. On March 17, Mawhood led a mixed force of 1,200 men, consisting of British regulars and Loyalist companies of New Jersey Volunteers and John Graves Simcoe's Queen's Rangers, across the Delaware River into Salem County, New Jersey.Carpenter, p. 196 General Wayne, alert to British movements, had largely completed his work and was in Burlington, preparing to return to Valley Forge. Alloway Creek in Salem County formed a natural line of defense, and the local militia, after learning of the British movement, established strong defensive positions at the two crossings nearest the Delaware, Quinton's Bridge and Hancock's Bridge, to prevent the British from crossing. Mawhood led his force to Salem, where they were met by some local Loyalists who told them that Colonel Benjamin Holme, along with 300 militia, was at Quinton's Bridge, only three miles (4.8 km) to the southeast. Holme had established his position on the north side of the bridge, and had taken up the bridge's planking to prevent its easy use. Battle Before dawn on March 18, Mawhood moved several detachments of men into position on the side of the creek opposite the American forces. He then displayed a portion of his force moving away from the bridge, as if to retreat. As soon as the Americans saw this movement, Captain William Smith replaced the planks and gave chase with 200 of the 300 men guarding the bridge. This force followed the British further along the road, eventually making contact with another group of soldiers that had been posted behind a rail fence. The remainder of the British force was nearby, posted in a house by the fence. When Smith and his men were attacked, the soldiers posted in the house slipped out and ran to the Americans' rear, cutting off any retreat to the bridge. They then forced Smith's force to attempt another crossing of the creek. At this point the main body of British soldiers arrived at the bridge and attempted to cross over to the American position. They were stopped by Colonel Elijah Hand and his militia, who arrived with two guns in time to stop a complete annihilation of the American force. In the event, the Americans lost between 30 and 40 men in the engagement, most to drowning. Aftermath Although the force at Quinton's Bridge had taken significant casualties, Colonel Hand and his men stayed to reinforce the position. Mawhood attempted to force the militia to retire the next day, but they were well-positioned and could not be dislodged. Mawhood then detached Major Simcoe and his rangers to attack the position at Hancock's Bridge. Simcoe and his men returned to the Delaware, and maneuvered downstream to reach the south side of the creek. From there they marched, according to Simcoe's account through difficult terrain, to the southern end of Hancock's Bridge. There they completely surprised 20 to 30 men stationed in the house of local judge William Hancock, putting them all to the bayonet. Although they had not intended to kill Hancock, Simcoe's intelligence had reported that Hancock had abandoned the house when it was occupied by the militia; in fact he had returned home the evening before, and was among those slain. Mawhood then sent a letter to Colonel Hand, warning him that if the militia did not put down their arms, he would \\"attack the militia wearing arms, burn their houses, and reduce them, their unfortunate wives, and their children to beggary and distress.\\"Carpenter, p. 198 Hand eloquently rejected the threat, writing that \\"[y]our threat to burn and destroy, induces me to imagine that I am reading the orders of a barbarous Attila, and not of a gentleman, brave, generous, and polished.\\"Carpenter, p. 199 Wayne's expedition through southern New Jersey heightened tensions between General Washington and New Jersey officials, since it brought on a wave of British violence, orchestrated by Colonel Mawhood. New Jersey had largely been left to its own defenses during the winter, and the British response to Wayne's movements led New Jersey officials to demand a Continental Army presence. One week after Wayne's departure, Washington sent a small detachment of Continentals into southern New Jersey, but it was wholly ineffective at preventing the crumbling of southern New Jersey militia organizations.Bodle, pp. 217-218 Notes References Historical collections of New Jersey, past and present, Volume 1 (contains a version of Simcoe's sketch of the affair) HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS OF THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY BY: JOHN W.

He claimed to have been born in 1736, while disputed records suggest 1677, implying an age at death of 197 and 306 years, respectively. Both far exceed the highest verified ages on record. He died three days after his 256th birthday in 1933. His true date of birth was never determined. His claims are considered to be a myth by gerontologists. While his claims have not been verified, they have been widely circulated as an Internet hoax. Biography Li Ching-Yuen spent most of his life in the mountains and was skilled in Qigong. He worked as an herbalist, selling lingzhi, goji berry, wild ginseng, he shou wu and gotu kola along with other Chinese herbs, and lived off a diet of these herbs and rice wine. It was generally accepted in Sichuan, that Li was fully literate as a child, and that by his tenth birthday had travelled to Gansu, Shanxi, Tibet, Vietnam, Thailand and Manchuria with the purpose of gathering herbs, continuing with this occupation for a century, before beginning to purvey instead herbs gathered by others. It was after this he relocated to Kai Xian and there Li supposedly, at 72 years of age, in 1749, joined the army of provincial Commander-in-Chief Yeuh Jong Chyi, as a teacher of martial arts and as a tactical advisor. In 1927, the National Revolutionary Army General Yang Sen (ÊèöÊ£Æ) invited him to his residence in Wan Xian, Sichuan, where the picture shown in this article was taken. The Chinese Warlord Wu Peifu (Âê≥‰Ω©Â≠ö) took him into his home in an attempt to discover the secret of living 250 years. He died from natural causes on 6 May 1933 in Kai Xian, Sichuan, Republic of China and was survived by his 24th wife, a woman of 60 years. Li supposedly produced over 200 descendants during his life span, surviving 23 wives. Other sources credit him with 180 descendants, over 11 generations, living at the time of his death and 14 marriages. After his death, the aforementioned Yang Sen wrote a report about him, A Factual Account of the 250 Year-Old Good-Luck Man (‰∏Ä‰∏™250Â≤ÅÈïøÂØøËÄÅ‰∫∫ÁöÑÁúüÂÆûËÆ∞ËΩΩ), in which he described Li's appearance: \\"He has good eyesight and a brisk stride; Li stands seven feet tall, has very long fingernails, and a ruddy complexion.\\" =Timeline of lifespan according to General Yang Sen= In Qijiang County, Sichuan province, in the year 1677 Li Qingyun was born. By age thirteen he had embarked upon a life of gathering herbs in the mountains with three elders. At age fifty-one, he served as a tactical and topography advisor in the army of General Yu Zhongqi. When seventy-eight he retired from his military career after fighting in a battle at Golden River, and returned to a life of gathering herbs on Snow Mountain in Sichuan province. Due to his military service in the army of General Yu Zhongqi, the imperial government sent a document congratulating Li on his one hundredth year of life, as was subsequently done on his 150th and 200th birthdays. In 1908, Li Qingyun and his disciple Yang Hexuan published a book, The Secrets of Li Qingyun‚Äôs Immortality. In 1920, General Xiong Yanghe interviewed Li (both men were from the village of Chenjiachang of Wan County in Sichuan province), publishing an article about it in the Nanjing University paper that same year. In 1926, Wu Peifu invited Li to Beijing. This visit coincides with Li teaching at the Beijing University Meditation Society at the invitation of the famous meditation master and author Yin Shi Zi. Then in 1927, General Yang Sen invited Li to Wanxian, where the first known photographs of Li were taken. Word spread throughout China of Li Qingyun, and Yang Sen's commander, General Chiang Kai-shek, requested Li to visit Nanjing. However, when Yang Sen's envoys arrived at Li‚Äôs hometown of Chenjiachang, they were told by Li‚Äôs wife and disciples that he had died in nature, offering no more information. So, his actual date of death and location has never been verified. Li Ching-Yuen died in Kai County in 1933. In 1928, Dean Wu Chung- chien of the Department of Education at Min Kuo University, discovered the imperial documents showing these birthday wishes to Li Qingyun. His discovery was first reported in the two leading Chinese newspapers of that period, North China Daily News and Shanghai Declaration News, and then maybe one year later, potentially in 1929 by The New York Times and Time magazine. Both of these theoretical Western publications also might have reported the death of Li Qingyun in May 1933. Longevity Whereas Li Ching-Yuen himself claimed to have been born in 1736, Wu Chung-chieh, a professor of the Chengdu University, asserted that Li was born in 1677; according to a 1930 New York Times article, Wu discovered Imperial Chinese government records from 1827 congratulating Li on his 150th birthday, and further documents later congratulating him on his 200th birthday in 1877. In 1928, a New York Times correspondent wrote that many of the old men in Li's neighborhood asserted that their grandfathers knew him when they were boys, and that he at that time was a grown man. However, a correspondent of The New York Times reported that \\"many who have seen him recently declare that his facial appearance is no different from that of persons two centuries his junior.\\" Moreover, gerontological researchers have viewed the age claim with extreme skepticism; the frequency of invalid age claims increases with the claimed age, rising from 65% of claims to ages 110‚Äì111 being invalid, to 98% of claims to being 115, with a 100% rate for claims of 120+ years. It is unclear though what, if any, implications these statistics have for the subject under discussion, as these figures refer to \\"false claims due to administrative errors\\" in Belgian public records. Researchers have called his claim \\"fantastical\\" and also noted that his claimed age at death, 256 years, is a multiple of 8, which is considered good luck in China, and therefore is indicative of fabrication. Additionally, the connection of Li's claimed age to his spiritual practices has been pointed to as another reason for doubt; researchers perceived that \\"these types of myths [that certain philosophies or religious practices allow a person to live to extreme old age] are most common in the Far East\\". One of Li's disciples, the Taijiquan Master Da Liu, told of his master's story: when 130 years old Master Li encountered in the mountains an older hermit, over 500 years old, who taught him Baguazhang and a set of Qigong with breathing instructions, movements training coordinated with specific sounds, and dietary recommendations. Da Liu reports that his master said that his longevity \\"is he performed the exercises every day ‚Äì regularly, correctly, and with sincerity ‚Äì for 120 years.\\" The article \\"Tortoise-Pigeon-Dog\\", from the 15 May 1933 issue of Time reports on his history, and includes Li's answer to the secret of a long life: * Keep a quiet heart * Sit like a tortoise * Walk sprightly like a pigeon * Sleep like a dog An article in the Evening Independent claims that Li's supposed longevity is due to his experimentation with medicinal herbs in his capacity as a druggist, his discovery in the Yunnan mountains of herbs which \\"prevent the ravages of old age\\" and which he continued to use throughout his life.

Geometrically, the n-vector for a given position on an ellipsoid is the outward-pointing unit vector that is normal in that position to the ellipsoid. For representing horizontal positions on Earth, the ellipsoid is a reference ellipsoid and the vector is decomposed in an Earth-centered Earth-fixed coordinate system. It behaves smoothly at all Earth positions, and it holds the mathematical one-to-one property. More in general, the concept can be applied to representing positions on the boundary of a strictly convex bounded subset of k-dimensional Euclidean space, provided that that boundary is a differentiable manifold. In this general case, the n-vector consists of k parameters. General properties A normal vector to a strictly convex surface can be used to uniquely define a surface position. n-vector is an outward-pointing normal vector with unit length used as a position representation. For most applications the surface is the reference ellipsoid of the Earth, and thus n-vector is used to represent a horizontal position. Hence, the angle between n-vector and the equatorial plane corresponds to geodetic latitude, as shown in the figure. The direction of n-vector corresponds to geodetic latitude A surface position has two degrees of freedom, and thus two parameters are sufficient to represent any position on the surface. On the reference ellipsoid, latitude and longitude are common parameters for this purpose, but like all two-parameter representations, they have singularities. This is similar to orientation, which has three degrees of freedom, but all three- parameter representations have singularities. In both cases the singularities are avoided by adding an extra parameter, i.e. to use n-vector (three parameters) to represent horizontal position and a unit quaternion (four parameters) to represent orientation. n-vector is a one-to-one representation, meaning that any surface position corresponds to one unique n-vector, and any n-vector corresponds to one unique surface position. As a Euclidean 3D vector, standard 3D vector algebra can be used for the position calculations, and this makes n-vector well-suited for most horizontal position calculations.  Converting latitude/longitude to n-vector  Based on the definition of the ECEF coordinate system, called e, it is clear that going from latitude/longitude to n-vector, is achieved by: :\\\\mathbf n^e=\\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\cos (\\\\mathrm{latitude})\\\\cos (\\\\mathrm{longitude}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cos (\\\\mathrm{latitude})\\\\sin (\\\\mathrm{longitude}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin (\\\\mathrm{latitude}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] The superscript e means that n-vector is decomposed in the coordinate system e (i.e. the first component is the scalar projection of n-vector onto the x-axis of e, the second onto the y-axis of e etc.). Note that the equation is exact both for spherical and ellipsoidal Earth model.  Converting n-vector to latitude/longitude  From the three components of n-vector, n_x^e, n_y^e, and n_z^e, latitude can be found by using: :\\\\mathrm{latitude}=\\\\arcsin\\\\left( n_z^e \\\\right)=\\\\arctan\\\\left( \\\\frac{n_z^e}{\\\\sqrt{{n_x^e}^2+{n_y^e}^2}} \\\\right) The rightmost expression is best suited for computer program implementation. Longitude is found using: :\\\\mathrm{longitude}=\\\\arctan\\\\left(\\\\frac{n_y^e}{n_x^e} \\\\right) In these expressions \\\\arctan(y/x) should be implemented using a call to atan2(y,x). The Pole singularity of longitude is evident as atan2(0,0) is undefined. Note that the equations are exact both for spherical and ellipsoidal Earth model.  Example: Great circle distance Finding the great circle distance between two horizontal positions (assuming spherical Earth) is usually done by means of latitude and longitude. Three different expressions for this distance are common; the first is based on arccos, the second is based on arcsin, and the final is based on arctan. The expressions, which are successively more complex to avoid numerical instabilities, are not easy to find, and since they are based on latitude and longitude, the Pole singularities may become a problem. They also contain deltas of latitude and longitude, which in general should be used with care near the ¬±180¬∞ meridian and the Poles. Solving the same problem using n-vector is simpler due to the possibility of using vector algebra. The arccos expression is achieved from the dot product, while the magnitude of the cross product gives the arcsin expression. Combining the two gives the arctan expression: :\\\\begin{align} & \\\\Delta \\\\sigma=\\\\arccos\\\\left( \\\\mathbf n_a\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf n_b \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\Delta \\\\sigma=\\\\arcsin\\\\left( \\\\left \\\\mathbf n_a\\\\times \\\\mathbf n_b \\\\right \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\Delta \\\\sigma=\\\\arctan\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\left \\\\mathbf n_a\\\\times \\\\mathbf n_b \\\\right}{\\\\mathbf n_a\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf n_b} \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} where \\\\mathbf n_a and \\\\mathbf n_b are the n-vectors representing the two positions a and b. \\\\Delta\\\\sigma is the angular difference, and thus the great-circle distance is achieved by multiplying with the Earth radius. This expression also works at the poles and at the ¬±180¬∞ meridian. Note that arctan must be replaced by atan2 in computer program implementation. There are several other examples where the use of vector algebra simplifies standard problems.

The Executive Director is Janelle McCoy. The role of artistic director was previously held by German organist and conductor Helmuth Rilling. About the festival The festival's programming is three- fold. It presents a diverse slate of concerts and guest artists, which in recent years has included non-Bach-related programs by Garrison Keillor, Bobby McFerrin, Frederica von Stade and Yo-Yo Ma; it maintains a focus on choral- orchestral repertoire, including commissions and premieres; and it undertakes extensive educational activities, most famously a conducting master class that draws participants from around the world as well as a Youth Choral Academy, the Stangland Family Youth Choral Academy, directed by conductor Anton Armstrong of St. Olaf College and a Composers Symposium directed by composer Robert Kyr.http://iwagemusic.com/about/ The Wall Street Journal has called the OBF \\"one of the world‚Äôs leading music festivals\\". Hult Center is one of the venues for the Oregon Bach Festival The Oregon Bach Festival is a donor- supported program of the University of Oregon. The activities of the festival are concentrated at Eugene's Hult Center for the Performing Arts and at the University of Oregon's School of Music & Dance, primarily at Beall Hall. History The festival was founded in 1970 by German conductor Helmuth Rilling and the former president of the American Choral Directors Association, Royce Saltzman, as an informal series of classes and concerts at the University of Oregon. By the late 1970s, the roster had expanded to include full-scale choral-orchestral performances. Although originally inspired by the music of Bach, the festival quickly moved beyond a strict boundary of repertoire. Bach, however, remains a centerpiece of the festival via Helmuth Rilling's conducting master class, which leads students through Cantatas, Masses, Passions, and other such choral works. Additionally, the festival frequently performs the largest Bach works with full forces; for example, in the 300th-anniversary year of Bach's birth in 1985, the festival performed the St. John Passion, St. Matthew Passion, B-minor Mass, and all six Brandenburg Concertos, culminating in an appearance at the Hollywood Bowl. The success of the Bach Festival model and structure led Helmuth Rilling to create the Internationale Bachakademie Stuttgart and several other Bach Academies around the world. In addition to the leadership of Helmuth Rilling, many other musicians have developed long-term relationships with the OBF. Conductor and pianist Jeffrey Kahane has been performing at the festival for over 20 years, and musicologist Robert Levin has also been a frequent participant. Baroque specialist Monica Huggett has appeared as an ensemble leader in 2009 and 2010. Baritone Thomas Quasthoff made his American debut at the OBF in 1995 and has returned several times since. Recent appearances have also been made by Midori, Sarah Chang, the Kronos Quartet, The Five Browns, and a variety of other classical stars. The festival also hosts \\"cross-over\\" or popular acts like Garrison Keillor, Savion Glover and Pink Martini.. =The festival in the 21st century= Royce Saltzman retired in 2006 and was replaced as Executive Director by John Evans, a former BBC producer and published Benjamin Britten scholar. Since Evans's arrival in 2007, the festival has expanded to include concerts throughout Oregon, including at Portland's Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall and Bend's Tower Theatre. Recent seasons have also included collaborations with other regional arts organizations, including the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, Portland Baroque Orchestra, and Eugene Ballet. The Festival has also completed its first endowment campaign, raising over $10 million. The 2010 festival, billed as a 40th-anniversary gala year, included appearances by Thomas Quasthoff, Pink Martini, Bobby McFerrin, Robert Levin and Ya-Fei Chuang, and the Portland Baroque Orchestra. It also featured a Bernstein celebration featuring a residency by Jamie Bernstein. In 2010 the festival announced the formation of a search committee to find a successor to Helmuth Rilling. In August 2011, OBF Executive Director John Evans announced that 35-year-old British conductor and keyboardist Matthew Halls, who has made significant conducting debuts with the Houston Symphony, Bach Collegium Stuttgart, Berlin Radio Symphony, and Frankfurt Radio Symphony, as well as founding and leading the pioneering Retrospect Ensemble, will assume artistic leadership of the University of Oregon event after the 2013 season. Phyllis and Andy Berwick donated $7.25 million to the festival in 2014, which is the largest gift in the group's history. Berwick Hall was christened as the first permanent home of the Festival in October 2017. In 2017, Matthew Halls was unexpectedly dismissed as artistic director. 2020 saw the COVID-19 pandemic as grounds for cancellation. The 50th was deferrd to 2021. =Milestones= The festival has commissioned, co-commissioned, or presented premieres of numerous musical works, including: * Felix Mendelssohn, The Uncle from Boston (world premiere of rediscovered manuscript) * Stephen Paulus, Symphony for Strings (world premiere) * Arvo P√§rt, Litany (world premiere) * Osvaldo Golijov, Oceana (world premiere) * Krzysztof Penderecki, Credo (world premiere) * Tan Dun, Water Passion (American premiere) * Sven-David Sandstr√∂m, Messiah (world premiere) * Sir James MacMillan, A European Requiem (world premiere) * Kim Andr√© Arnesen, Falling into Mercy (world premiere) * Philip Glass, Piano Concerto No. 3 (regional premiere) * Richard Danielpour, The Passion of Yeshua (world premiere) The festival has also released or participated in 12 commercial recordings since 1990, with the recording of Penderecki's Credo winning the 2001 Grammy Award for Best Choral Performance. The festival has also initiated a media partnership with Minnesota Public Radio that provides for the syndication and worldwide broadcast of live concert recordings.

The player controls a Formula One racer, with the objective being to complete three laps of a race course and to avoid a collision with opponents and other obstacles. Three difficulty levels are available, as is a mode to enable a gear shift. Similar to Namco's own Final Lap series, the arcade cabinet can be linked together with another unit to enable eight-person multiplayer. It ran on the Namco System 22 arcade hardware. Ace Driver was designed by Tatsuro Okamoto, his known for his work on the classic arcade game Metro-Cross (1985). He was assisted by Pole Position designer Shinichiro Okamoto. The game was a widespread success, winning the \\"Best Coin-Operated Game\\" award at the 76th Annual IAAPA tradeshow in November 1994. Critics praised the game's realistic graphics, multiplayer and responsive controls, with some reviewers finding it to be superior than Sega's Daytona USA and Namco's own Ridge Racer. It was followed by two sequels, Ace Driver: Victory Lap (1995) and Ace Driver 3: Final Turn (2008). A PlayStation home conversion announced in 1995 went unreleased. Gameplay In-game screenshot Ace Driver is a 3D racing video game. Gameplay involves the player controlling a Formula One racer, the objective being to complete three laps of a race while in first place. The player can choose one of eight playable vehicles, which is determined by which seat the player has chosen on the cabinet itself. Cars also carry advertisements featuring names of older Namco video games and products, in a manner similar to the Ridge Racer series. The player can also choose from three difficulty levels ‚Äî Beginner, Expert, and Expert Pro Race Class. Namco produced two versions of the game, an SD model and a DX model. The SD version features a basic sit-down structure, while the DX version features seats that rotate based on the player's actions in the game. Both cabinets are linkable, and allow for an additional machine to be connected to it, which enables eight-person multiplayer. Development and release Ace Driver was released in Japan in November 1994, followed by a North American release later that year and a European release in March 1995. The game was designed by Tatsuro Okamoto, known for his work on Metro-Cross and the Final Lap series, with assistance from Pole Position designer Shinichiro Okamoto. The arcade cabinet, designed by mechanical engineer Junichiro Koyama, is much heavier than Namco's other arcade cabinets, which made it difficult for the game to be easily shipped. The game ran on the Namco System 22 hardware, which was also used for the original Ridge Racer, with speaker systems provided by American company BOSE. Care was taken during production of the game's controls so as to make them tight and easy to use, which Okamoto recalls being as responsive as moving a shopping cart. The DX version, which featured rotating seats, was stated to have been dangerous in the event cabinet was placed up against the wall, leading to small fences being placed towards the base of the cabinet. Reception Ace Driver was a widespread success, with reviewers praising its impressive technological capabilities and realistic graphics. At the 76th Annual IAAPA tradeshow in November 1994, it was awarded the \\"Best Coin- Operated Game\\" award for its texture-mapped 3D graphics, force feedback and motion-based cabinet. In Japan, Game Machine listed it on their January 1, 1995 issue as being the second most-successful dedicated arcade game of the year. The game was also a commercial success, with Namco reporting an \\"overwhelming\\" number of orders placed for the eight-player version. Edge magazine was impressed with the game's eight-person multiplayer and technological capabilities, saying that it easily outperformed Sega's Daytona USA, which they attributed to the Namco Super System 22 arcade operating hardware it ran on. Edge also praised the game's usage of Gouraud shading techniques for giving it a realistic look at feel, concluding that Ace Driver helps justify Namco's reputation for producing impressive technology. In their debut issue, Next Generation liked the game's unique \\"side-by-side\\" movement, saying that it created a much more realistic sense of turning and gave the game more of an \\"edge\\" compared to Namco's other driving game, Ridge Racer 2. They concluded their review by saying \\"It may not be the best all-around racing title out today, but for competitive multi-player action, Ace Driver holds the title.\\" Spanish publication Hobby Hitech found the game superior to both Daytona USA and Sega Rally, showing a positive response towards the game's controls and realistic graphics. They also considered the game a true successor to Ridge Racer, highlighting its presentation and sense of speed. In a 2012 retrospect, Kotaku was more negative towards the game for its \\"atrocious\\" menu system and poor collision detection, while also disliking its rubber banding mechanic for making the game unfair to more experienced players. Despite their criticism, they said that its broken mechanics \\"made the game a blast\\" to play. Sequels and legacy A sequel, Ace Driver: Victory Lap, was released in 1995 for arcades, featuring additional tracks and vehicles, alongside a new \\"Championship\\" gameplay mode. A second sequel, Ace Driver 3: Final Turn, was first presented at the Spring Amusement Operator's Union (AOU) tradeshow in 2008, before being released later that year. A home conversion of Ace Driver for the PlayStation was announced to be in development in August 1995, although it was never released.

Columbia Pictures On October 28, 1986, Harvey Films had a lawsuit with Columbia Pictures claiming that the logo for the film Ghostbusters was similar to the logo for The Ghostly Trio, specifically the ghost in the logo was similar to Fatso, and Columbia argued that Fatso was only a portion of their, at the time, renewed trademark, and there were three ghosts instead of just one. The court argued that the logos are largely dissimilar and that The Ghostly Trio had only the words of the trademark and the three ghosts while the logo for Ghostbusters has a sign for prohibition with only the torso and head of only one ghost. The expressions are different, with their ghosts having mischievous or evil facial expressions, while the other one is bewildered. The court said \\"Accordingly, the Court concludes that the claimed likelihood of confusion has no material basis in fact. The sole evidence which Harvey has produced on this issue are excerpts from magazine articles which suggest a general association between the \\"Ghostbusters\\" logo and \\"Casper\\" comics. It is clear from reading these articles that there was no confusion whatsoever on the part of the authors. A finding of general association, that the \\"Ghostbusters\\" logo is reminiscent of \\"Casper\\" characters, does not mean that the prospective moviegoer in purchasing a ticket for \\"Ghostbusters\\" thinks that he is going to see a \\"Casper\\" cartoon. Neither does it mean that he will think that \\"Ghostbusters\\" is derived from \\"Casper\\" cartoons or that it is sponsored by the same source as \\"Casper.\\" \\" The court dismissed the case for not violating their trademark.

He served as the minister of the treasury in the Congress Kingdom of Poland. He was nicknamed \\"Small Prince\\" because of his short height.  Biography Franciszek was born to Genowefa Olizar-Wo≈Çczkiewicz and Franciszek Drucki-Lubecki of the Drucki-Lubecki aristocratic family in Pohost Zahorodzki in Polesia (today's Pahost Zaharodski, a village in the Brest voblast of Belarus) on 4 January 1778. After graduation from an infantry cadet school he joined the Russian military in 1794 and remained in service until 1800. He served under the command of Alexander Suvorov and participated in his campaigns in Italy and Switzerland. Then he became the Marshal of Nobility of Grodno gubernia. From 1813 to 1815 he was the member of the High Provisional Council (Rada Najwy≈ºsza Tymczasowa) of the Duchy of Warsaw. He supported the peaceful resolution of the conflict with Russian Empire and supported Alexander I of Russia, who he thought was liberal enough to support extended Polish autonomy. In 1816 he became the Governor General of Grodno gunernia and a member of the commission for settling the financial accounts between Kingdom of Poland and Russian Empire. He organised a campaign for the introduction of foreign investors, professionals and workers into Poland. In 1816, as a governor, he issued a set of conditions for the settlement of \\"useful foreigners\\" in the Congress Kingdom of Poland. City of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ was one that greatly benefited from his policies, becoming an important textile center . Drawing by Walenty ≈öliwicki On 20 June 1820 he married Maria Scipio del Campo. They had three daughters: Tekla Drucka-Lubecka, Genowefa Drucka-Lubecka and Julia Drucka-Lubecka. From 1821 to 1830 he was the minister of Treasure in the Kingdom of Poland. From 1824 he reformed the mining and ironworks industries. His policies significantly improved the budget and treasury of the Kingdom: he introduced many saving policies, improved tax collection, introduced new indirect taxes and expanded the national monopoly on salt and tobacco. He eliminated the budgetary deficit and using his connections in Russia he eliminated many tariffs between the Kingdom of Poland and proper Russian Empire. This has improved the Polish exports eastwards. He also protected new industries from western import, especially from Germany, which led to a tariff war with Prussia. He founded the National Bank of Poland in 1828 , he was also the initiator of the Land Credit Society (Towarzystwo Kredytowe Ziemskie). Drucki was convinced of harmfulness of laissez-faire policies and supported state interventionism. He represented the political faction known as 'Conciliators', which believed that Polish independence may come only through economic growth and diplomacy, not military adventures . However the Conciliators were handicapped not only by their domestic opponents, the 'Insurrectionist' faction, but by the Russian imperial authorities themselves who rarely saw the need to compromise with a defeated, weak enemy . In the second half of the 19th century such line of thought would be continued by the positivists, and later by the endecja movement. Therefore, Drucki opposed the November Uprising against the Russia, which he deemed as folly and a dangerous gambit which would lose all that has been achieved over the past decade. During the uprising he attempted to negotiate with Russian authorities, but to no avail. After the defeat of the uprising - which, incidentally, was sponsored by money Drucki gathered in the nation's treasury - he left Poland but still remained in the Polish government, becoming a member of the new, now much more Russian-controlled, National Council. Since December 1830 he worked in Saint Petersburg on the legal reform for Poland. Since 1832 he became a member of State Council of Imperial Russia and in 1834 he worked on settling the financial accounts between Russia and France. After 1830 he never returned to Poland. He died on 10 May 1846 in Saint Petersburg in the Russian Empire. Ksawera quarter in Bƒôdzin is named after him. There is also a non-governmental think tank in Poland, dedicated to the worlds of business and academics. Honours and awards In 1816, Franciszek was awarded the Polish Order of the White Eagle and, in 1815, he was awarded the Russian Order of St. Vladimir.

The technique is thought to offer extra protection to the face whilst making it easier to jab the opponent's face. The fighter holds their gloves close to their cheeks and pulls their arms tight against their torso. A major proponent of the style was trainer Cus D'Amato, who didn't use the term peek-a-boo and instead referred to it as a \\"tight defense.\\" The style was criticized by some because it was believed that an efficient attack could not be launched from it. Concept Peek-a-boo's key principles are built upon the \\"Bad intentions\\" concept, which emphasize the D'amato philosophy. The general idea is that the Peek-a-boo practitioners are counterpunchers, who contrary to accustomed ways of counterpunching perceived as constantly backing-up and jabbing from the safe distance, move forward and do it with a lot of aggressiveness by constantly charging at the opponent, provoking him into throwing punches to counter, and subsequently into making mistakes to capitalize on, by creating openings and dominant angles of attack. Hands and upper-body movement Peek-a-boo boxing utilizes relaxed hands with the forearms in front of the face and the fist at nose-eye level. Other unique features include side-to-side head movements, bobbing, weaving and blind siding the opponent. A fighter using the peek-a-boo style is drilled with the stationary dummy and on the bag until the fighter is able to punch by rapid combinations with what D'Amato called \\"bad intentions\\". The style allows swift neck movements as well as quick duckings and bad returning damage, usually by rising uppercuts or even rising hooks. Footwork Peek-a-boo footwork is not that frequently noted by observers, which usually focus on the upper-body movement and striking, but it sets the base for both the effective upper-body movement and punching with leverage. The footwork is aimed to close the distance, crowd the opponent, cut-off his escape routes, negate his reach advantage, and create dominant angles for attack simultaneously. To be able to slip and counter the opponent's punches, the practitioner should be able to do it from a neutral or near-neutral stance, with his pelvis squared-up in parallel against the opponent's pelvis, for it creates more room for the lateral upper-body movement side-to-side with more amplitude, and places conventional boxers in an unfamiliar position relatively to the Peek-a-boo practitioners. Peek-a-boo pelvic movement also sets the momentum for uppercuts. As the Peek-a-boo footwork requires shifting and occasional stance- switching, ambidextrous boxers prevail over both orthodox and southpaws, gaining the ultimate advantage by constantly and deliberately changing their stance.

It was ported to Super Famicom in 1992. Story In the year 2100, the Earth's environment is devastated by its inhabitants, who develop their space technology to live on Mars. Before they left, the humans created a Bio-Computer assigned to replenish Earth's ecosystem in hopes of returning to Earth. 50 years after terra-forming parts of Mars, the human colonists were attacked by mysterious, but hostile UFOs. The military leaders among the colonists set up an attack force to defend the colonists using state of the art fighter ships identified as the Icarus. The main operation of attack is called \\"Acrobat Mission\\" because it exceeds the technical flying ability of the pilots. In the arcade version, surviving fighter pilots Jet and Nova are available for the player to choose for the rest of the game, but both were removed from the Super Famicom version, making the player's pilot anonymous as well as discarding Nova's custom color scheme. At the end of the arcade version, after destroying the enemy fortress, various images of the Earth's past are shown, such as the pollution caused by humanity, and the planet itself, flashing before the pilot's eyes. Here however is the story, exactly as it appears at the beginning of the game, with spelling and grammar mistakes preserved: \\"AD 2100: HUMANS EXTERMINATED BY THEIR OWN NATURE DISTRUPTION AND ESCAPE TO MARS LEAVING BIO-COMPUTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL RECUPERATION OF EARTH. ONE DAY HALF A CENTURY AFTER HUMANS ARRIVED, MARS WAS ATTACKED BY STRANGE FLYING OBJECTES. TO FIGHT THESE ENEMIES, THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF THE DEFENCE AGENCY ORGANIZED THE TASK FORCE ARMY AND STARTED THE DOG FIGHT WITH INVADERS QUICLY. THE OPERATION WAS CALLED \\"ACROBAT MISSION\\" AS IT EXCEEDED THE PILOT'S TECHNICAL LIMIT.\\" Gameplay Players started the game equipped with the default weapon, the Standard Shot: a semi-automatic laser weapon. Though moderately powerful, the Standard Shot cannot be upgraded or charged. Once the player has lost a significant number of lives and their selected weapon his lost its upgrades, the Standard Shot will once again take over. Two other weapons are selectable to the player, one of which is the Wave Shot (announced as Wide in the Arcade version). The Wave Shot is a spread shot that increases in size, numbers and strength. When charged, the Wave Shot can unleash a short range, but powerful laser blast that increases in width and strength when Wave icons are collected. The other weapon was the Hurricane Shot, a unique area-effect weapon that encircles the ship clockwise when fired before flying forward. When charged, the Hurricane Shot fires a ball of energy across the screen, but there is a one-second delay every time the shot is fired. The player also had Bombs although unlike many shooters, the player can only hold up to two bombs. Once collected however, the two bombs get physically mounted under the ship's wings. If an enemy shot hits one of the bombs, then the bomb will detonate, creating a destructive shield for the player. The player can manually detonate either bomb at will. The player's Icarus fighter ship has a number of defenses at its disposal as well. Whenever the player moves their ship in any given direction, a burst of flame from the ship's jet exhaust will shoot out from the opposite direction the player moves the ship in. This applies to all directions: left, right, front, back and all four diagonal angles. This jet exhaust not only serves an aesthetic purpose, but it can also harm nearby enemies and destroy nearby objects. Whenever the player is hit, their ship will steer wildly out of control. Once this happens, a timer will appear near the ship which indicates how long the ship has until it explodes. The explosion of the player's ship will harm any nearby enemies. Also, because the Icarus is apparently well built, any kamikaze enemies or drifting objects that touch it will not damage or destroy the player's ship, allowing the player less restrictive movement. Levels Stage 1: Martian Surface Stage 2: Satellite Orbit Stage 3: Mechanical Planet Surface Stage 4: Mechanical Planet Tube System Stage 5: Enemy Main Computer Port differences Acrobat Mission was ported from the Arcades to the Super Famicom. However, major changes were made as a result. * 2 player mode was disabled. * Pilot selection between Jet or Nova was omitted from the beginning of the game. * The graphics were also downgraded a bit during the port as the SFC version processed certain effects (such as explosions) slower. * The mechanical enemy fortress as well as some of the enemies and bosses were re-colored while the final boss saw a partial redesign. * The effectiveness of the weapons were downgraded somewhat as the Hurricane weapon is faulty even when fully powered up in the SFC version; when fully powered up in the Arcade version, the charge weapons took up 75% of the screen. * The sound effects were almost completely replaced in the SFC port, such as the voice in the arcade version saying the name of the weapon the player picks up. * The original ending was completely removed from the SFC version and replaced with a simple screen of scrolling text, which congratulates the player and includes a new ending song that was not present in the arcade version. However, even though the original ending sequence was removed, the original ending music is still present and can be accessed in the sound test.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Acrobat Mission on their September 1, 1991 issue as being the fourteenth most-successful table arcade unit of the year. Record Antonio R. Filho (Brazil) holds the official world record for this game with a maximum 279.900 points.

The brand operates internationally under the name KYOSHO. The company's main office is located in Chiyoda, Tokyo, and the production headquarters are located in Atsugi, Kanagawa. The company is one of the oldest model rc car makers in Japan, and produces a wide variety of products, including radio-controlled cars, planes, helicopters, and boats. Kyosho also produces highly detailed die-cast model cars. Its major competitor in the RC automobile market is Tamiya. Kyosho has avoided direct competition against Tamiya in the hobby grade RC cars market since the 80s and 90s, where Tamiya was most active, focusing instead on designing professional 1/8 scale racing buggies, Mini-Z series, and RC helicopters; areas in which Kyosho dominates today. The company is best known for the Inferno, its 1/8 scale competition buggies; Mini-Z series, and RC helicopters, but it also produces remote-controlled bipedal robots in the Manoi series. History The company was created in October 1963 and created its first trademark R/C car in 1970. Production of die-cast model cars began in 1992. R/C Products Kyosho produces a wider range of RC products than any other RC manufacturer, including racing and ready-to-run cars, trucks, excavators, helicopters, scale, sport and warbird RC planes, and a range of RC boats. Having recently acquired Team Orion, Kyosho now has category-leading products in electric motors (brushed and brushless), Ni-MH and Li-PO batteries and battery chargers.

Many of these models have retained popularity, even after going out of production. Notable models * 1978 Eleck Peanuts * 1979 Rally-sports Renault Alpine A310 * 1982 Scorpion * 1983 Tomahawk * 1984 Progress 4WDS * 1985 Optima/Javelin * 1987 Ultima * 1988 Optima Mid * 1989 Turbo Optima Mid * 1989 Lazer ZX DASH 1 Kyosho started selling the DASH 1 in 1970, accepted widely in the industry as the first RC car made in Japan. There were three body styles to be chosen from; the most popular racing machines in the Japanese Grand Prix: the Porsche 917, Lola T70 and McLaren Elva. The bodies were vacuum molded, a totally new innovation in RC cars at the time. The DASH 1 was priced at 23,000 yen, not including the engine. Engines used were still the imported 19-class VECO (West Germany) and K&B; (U.S.A.) marine engines with a Perry Carburettor and Kyosho's Fuel Stopper and a car muffler. DASH 2 In 1971 the DASH 2 targeted at beginners (price: 16,500 Yen) was released. The DASH 1 used a two-piece chassis, but the DASH 2 had a one-piece chassis and the engine was only at a slight front angle. In addition, the SUPER DASH (price: 26,000 Yen) was released as a competition level machine. DASH 3 The DASH 3 and the DUNE BUGGY were released in 1972, starting the buggy racing phenomenon. Eleck Peanuts This was the first electric off-road car sold by Kyosho. A motor was placed on the PeanutBuggy, which had previously been sold as an engine car. It was sold for 9,800 yen at the time. Rally-sports A 2WD off-road car with a RS540 motor in the rear. The frame was that of the Alpine A310. Uses a double wishbone for front suspension, and a semi-streaming arm for rear suspension. The cars aluminum frame and rear design were passed on to the Scorpion. Sold for 16,000 yen at the time. Scorpion Races with electric off-road cars increased in popularity after the release of Tamiya's Rough Rider. The 2WD \\"Scorpion\\" was released by Kyosho during this period. Kyosho had been promoting its 1/8 scale engine buggy \\"Circuit 20\\" in races at the time, and the Scorpion can be described as a miniaturized version of the Circuit 20. The double trailing arm front suspension, semi-streaming rear suspension, aluminum ladder frame, rear-mounted RS540S motor, oil damper and coil springs very much resemble the design for a 1/8 scale racing buggy of the time. The thin body was realized by placing the batteries pointing forward, and its light weight (1680g, with full equipment) gave it a huge advantage over rival models. Its main rivals were Tamiya's Rough Rider and ayk's 556B. The Scorpion revolutionized radio-controlled racing with its release, as it became almost impossible to win races without using a Scorpion. This model became one of the most popular of Kyosho's products, and sold for 17,800 yen at the time. The \\"Tomahawk\\" uses the same suspension as the Scorpion, but its layout was completely made over. The plastic mech box was changed to a double-deck mech plate, allowing its weight to decrease to 1,450g. It was sold for 19,800 yen at the time. The \\"Turbo Scorpion\\" was also derived from the Scorpion. This model was sold for 19,800 yen at the time. The same chassis was used for the engine driven models \\"Advance\\" and \\"Assault\\" These were popular models at the time but not near as popular as the original Scorpion. In 2012 Kyosho presented a new model using the Scorpion name: the Kyosho Scorpion XXL. It is a 1/7th scale rear wheel drive dune buggy available in both brushless and glow powered RTR options as well as a kit that can be built either way and swapped as the modeller desires. However, this car is completely unrelated to the original Scorpion in its parts. In 2014 Kyosho announced a re released version of Scorpion, beefed up and refined where needed so it can be outfitted with modern gear such as Lipo and brushless motor. Modern highlights include a slipper clutch, 48-pitch geartrain, compatibility with the Ultima RB‚Äôs ball diff (as an upgrade from the supplied gear diff), and wide-track front suspension. The shocks are also improved, with the smooth action expected of modern oil-filled units. Progress series The \\"Progress 4WDS\\" was Kyosho's first electric 4WD off-road racer. The motor was mounted on the rear overhang, and the forward wheel moves with a chain extending from the rear gearbox. This chain system was also tried on the on-road racer, \\"Fantom EP.\\" The rear suspension was an orthodox double trailing arm and oil damper with coil springs, but the front suspension featured a double wishbone and mono damper, and substituted a torsion bar for a spring. This unique front suspension was rather difficult to set up, and had a short arm, which prevented it from taking powerful strokes. The front wheel on the 4WS series could only move in the opposite direction as the rear wheel, and turning wide curves was also difficult with this series. Adjustments were made with each successive model, but the Progress series became infamous as a slow car unable to live up to its full potential. Kyosho's first series of 4WDs was too heavy and clumsy to compete in serious RC racing. * Progress 4WDS * Gallop 4WDS * Gallop MKII Optima series This was Kyosho's highly successful series of 4WD off-road racers. Many of the models gained widespread popularity in off-road RC racing. Notable models (in order of release) * Optima (a 4WD buggy with a chain drive system. Uses an aluminum ladder frame) * Javelin (uses the same frame, but was equipped with a frame-like body. Some parts, including the damper stay, became optional parts) * Gold Optima (this limited model was released after the 100,000th Optima was sold. 10,000 of this model were produced. The name comes from the gold colored anodic coating) used on many of its parts. * Turbo Optima (sections were strengthened to allow an 8.4V battery to be used. Equipped with a Le Mans 240S motor and ball bearings) * Salute (a Turbo Optima with a different body. The motor was sold separately, resulting in a cheaper overall cost) * Optima Pro 4WD (the last Optima to use a chain drive system. Uses an amp (ESC)) * Optima Mid (all of the Optima models below are belt drive models. The location of the motor was changed from the rear overhang to an RMR layout. The frame was made of duralumin and fibre- reinforced plastic) * Turbo Optima Mid (the upper echelon of the Optima Mid series. Sold with several optional parts) *Turbo Optima Mid SE * Turbo Optima Mid Special (the wheelbase of the Optima Mid was extended, and was sold with a carbon fiber frame. Only a maximum of two were shipped per store, as it was a limited model) * Optima Mid Custom (a low priced version of the Turbo Optima Mid special. The frame is made of duralmin) * Optima Mid Custom Special (similar to the Turbo Optima Mid special, with the LWB duralumin frame (some were confirmed to have been produced with the carbon fiber frame), but the body was changed to a \\"bullet type\\" canopy body) Ultima series The 2WD racing buggy created following the Tomahawk. The double wishbone suspension and aluminum monocoque frame gave the buggy far more speed than previous models. The car won 1st place in the 2nd electric off-road 2WD world tournament held in England in 1987. * Ultima (a 2WD buggy created in the style of the Optima series) * Turbo Ultima (: duralmin flat pan frame, white color,special \\"Platinum Shocks\\" with graphite shock towers and full ball bearings. Ball differential and motor guard. ) * Ultima Pro ( fibre-reinforced plastic frame, Gold shocks,full ball bearings, Ball differential, motor guard, adjustable tie rods, stick or saddle pack battery configuration. ) * Ultima Pro XL (Similar to the Ultima Pro but with a single plate chassis. Longer front and rear suspension arms. Adjustable rear toe in and 48 pitch spur and pinion gears.) * Ultima II and Turbo Ultima II (The Ultima II was a basic Ultima for beginners. The Turbo Ultima II had Gold shocks,full bearings and ball differential. Both models had the new Kyosho \\"Kelron\\" chassis.) * Outlaw Ultima ST (The only Stadium truck made from the original Ultima II chassis. Kelron chassis and aluminum front shock towers with long shocks. Ford Ranger body came with the kit.) * Triumph * Pro X (the first edition had a problem with the ball differential, but was fixed in the second release) * Ultima RB (appeared for the first time in the 1999 world championship. The Type-R model was geared towards competitions, while the sport model was designed for beginners) * Ultima RB Type-R Evolution (the Ultima RB Type-R with optional parts included) * Ultima RB5 (released in March, 2007) * Ultima RB5 SP (released in May, 2009) * Ultima RB5 SP2 (released in April, 2010 featuring a new rear end and body) * Ulitma RT5 (2WD truck released in September, 2009) * Ultima SC (2WD CORR truck released in February, 2010) * Ultima SCR (2WD truck released in 2011) * Ultima RB6 (2WD Electric Buggy, Released Oct. 2012) * Ultima RB6.6 (2wd Electric Buggy, Released May. 2015) Lazer series A series started with the \\"Lazer ZX\\", which became the basic model for the Optima series. It evolved from \\"Lazer ZX-R\\" to \\"Lazer ZX Sport,\\" \\"Lazer ZX-RR, \\"Lazer ZX-S,\\" \\"Lazer ZX-S Evolution\\" and later versions called the \\"Lazer Alpha\\" (starter car with many ABS parts), \\"Lazer 2000\\" (kelron parts). The body design for the Lazer ZX was rather unpopular from the start, and many users, including the Kyosho racing team, preferred to use the bodyset from the Turbo Optima Mid Special. The current model, \\"Lazer ZX-5\\" has a similar name, but bears a completely different design from its predecessors. It employs a shaft-driven 4WD system rather than the belt-driven system of its predecessors, a longitudinally mounted motor, and a new low-profile body. In 2011, June, there was available Kyosho ZX-5 FS2, and ZX-5 RTR. The ZX-5 has been a huge success at racing in Europe and North-America. The original kit has been upgraded from FS to FS2 featuring lipo ready chassis, new body and a new rear end. The FS2 has since been upgraded again to FS2 SP specification with the inclusion of big bore shock absorbers and other minor changes. Die- Cast Cars Since 1992, Kyosho has specialized in creating high end collector's grade Die-Cast Car Replicas. Kyosho offers a wide array of scale replicas and car makers. Kyosho's main competition comes from companies such as AUTOart, Minichamps, and Hot Wheels. Kyosho is also the official manufacturer of BMW Authorized scale replicas sold exclusively through BMW Dealerships. As of January 2008, their online catalogue includes approximately 1000 die cast cars and accessories. Radio controlled aircraft Radio controlled replica of the Aberle Phantom wearing the 2007 Kyosho sponsorship decals found on the full-scale version that year The 2000s saw a shift toward the growing hobby of radio controlled model aircraft and the creation of almost ready-to-fly models. One such model, the \\"Phantom 70,\\" is a quarter- scale replica of the Aberle Phantom biplane. Based in Fallbrook, California USA, the full-scale Phantom was built by Aberle Custom Aircraft and sponsored by Kyosho during the 2007 Reno Air Races. The plane set a biplane-class speed record in 2004 with a top speed of more than 241 mph. A new record was established in 2006 with a speed of 251.958 mph.http://www.aberlecustomaircraft.com/ Aberle Custom Aircraft home page Phantom 70 home page at Kyosho America Potential for renewed production Since rival company Tamiya renewed the production of popular classic models such as the \\"Frog,\\" \\"Grasshopper,\\" \\"Hornet,\\" and \\"Hotshot,\\" many fans hope for Kyosho to do the same with its own classics. However, the company has already gotten rid of most of the old frame casts, making prospects of renewed production costly and difficult. During the Shizuoka Hobby Show in May, 2006, Kyosho introduced \\"Optima\\" and \\"Turbo Scorpion\\" in its new \\"Miniature Racing Buggy series\\". Though only 10 cm in length, these die-cast pullback toys feature exactly the same package design as the original RC kits, showing that Kyosho does recognize fan demand for renewed production.

Russian railways are the third longest by length and third by volume of freight hauled, after the railways of the United States and China. In overall density of operations (freight ton-kilometers + passenger-kilometers)/length of track, Russia is second only to China. Rail transport in Russia has been described as one of the economic wonders of the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries.Intro adapted from Russell Pittman, \\"Blame the Switchman? Russian Railways Restructuring After Ten Years,\\" working paper, Antitrust Division, U.S. Department of Justice, 2011. Blame the Switchman? Russian Railways Restructuring After Ten Years JSC Russian Railways has a near-monopoly on long-distance train travel in Russia, with a 98.6% market share in 2017. Independent long-distance carriers include Grand Service Express TC, Tverskoy Express, TransClassService, Sakhalin Passenger Company, Kuzbass Suburb, and Yakutian Railway. Characteristics Russia is larger than both the United States and China in terms of total land area, therefore its rail density (rail tracking/country area) is lower compared to those two countries. Since Russia's population density is also much lower than that of China and the United States, the Russian railways carry freight and passengers over very long distances, often through vast, nearly empty spaces. Coal and coke make up almost one-third of the freight traffic and have average hauls of around 1,500 kilometers, while ferrous metals make up another 10 percent of freight traffic and travel an average of over 1,900 kilometers. Railroads are often key to getting supplies shipped to remote parts of the country as many people do not have access to other reliable means of shipping. Like most railways, rail transport in Russia carries both freight and passengers. It is one of the most freight-dominant railways in the world, behind only Canada, the United States, and Estonia in the ratio of freight ton-kilometers to passenger-kilometers. However, per head of population intercity passenger travel is far greater than the United States (which has the lowest long-distance passenger train usages in the developed world). Structure Russia's railways are divided into seventeen regional railways, from the October Railway serving the St. Petersburg region to the Far Eastern Railway serving Vladivostok, with the free-standing Kaliningrad and Sakhalin Railways on either end. The regional railways were closely coordinated by the Ministry of the Means of Communication until 2003, and the Joint Stock Company Russian Railways since then ‚Äì including the pooling and redistribution of revenues. This has been crucial to two long-standing policies of cross-subsidization: to passenger operations from freight revenues, and to coal shipments from other freight. History Russian locomotive class U ‚Äì U-127 Lenin's 4-6-0 oil burning compound locomotive, currently preserved at the Museum of the Moscow Railway at Paveletsky Rail Terminal The Russian railways were a collection of mostly privately owned and operated companies during most of the 19th century, though many had been constructed with heavy government involvement and financing. The tsarist government began mobilizing and nationalizing the rail system as World War I approached, and the new communist government finished the nationalization process. With the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, the Russian Federation was left with three-fifths of the railway track of the Union as well as nine- tenths of the highway mileage ‚Äì though only two-fifths of the port capacity. In the 21st century, substantial changes in the Russian railways have been discussed and implemented in the context of two government reform documents: Decree No. 384 of 18 May 2001 of the Government of the Russian Federation, \\"A Program for Structural Reform of Railway Transport\\", and Order No. 877 of 17 June 2008 of the Government of the Russian Federation, \\"The Strategy for Railway Development in the Russian Federation to 2030\\". The former focused on restructuring the railways from government-owned monopoly to private competitive sector; the latter focused on ambitious plans for equipment modernization and network expansion. =Timeline of railway implementation= 1837 ‚Äì the Tsarskoye Selo Railway (27 km); 1843 ‚Äì Inkerman Railway (about one km); 1848 ‚Äì the Warsaw-Vienna Railway (800 km); 1851 ‚Äì Nikolayev Railway (645 km); 1855 ‚Äì The Balaklava Railway (about 23 km); 1861 ‚Äì the Riga-Dinaburg railway (218 km) 1862 ‚Äì the Petersburg-Warsaw Railway (1116 km) 1862 ‚Äì the Moscow-Nizhny Novgorod railway (437 km) 1868 ‚Äì Moscow-Kursk railway (543 km) 1870 ‚Äì Yaroslavl Railway 1878 ‚Äì the Ural Mining and Railroads (by 1880‚Äì715 km); 1884 ‚Äì Catherine (Krivorog (g)) railway) (by 1884‚Äì523 km); 1890 ‚Äì Samara- Zlatoust railway (1888 ‚Äì Samara-Ufa, by 1893 about 1500 km); 1898 ‚Äì the Perm- Kotlas railway; 1900 ‚Äì The Ussuri railway (964 km); 1900 ‚Äì the Moscow- Savyolovo line 1903 ‚Äì the Sino-Eastern Railway (Manchurian, Chinese Changchun, Harbin); 1905 ‚Äì Trans-Baikal Railway; The Circum-Baikal Railway; Petersburg- Vologda railway 1906 ‚Äì Theological Railway; The Tashkent railway; 1908 ‚Äì Moscow District Railway 1915 ‚Äì the Altai Railway; 1916 ‚Äì the Amur Railway; The Volga-Bugulma Railway; West-Ural railway; The Moscow-Kazan railway; North- Eastern Ural Railway; The Trans-Siberian Railway (historical part); 1926 ‚Äì the Achinsk-Minusinsk railway; 1930 ‚Äì the Turkestan-Siberian Railway; 1936 ‚Äì 1937 ‚Äì The Norilsk Railway 1940 ‚Äì Kanash‚ÄìCheboksary 1944 ‚Äì The Big Ring of the Moscow Railway 1969 ‚Äì the line of Verbilki‚ÄìDubna 1978 ‚Äì Rostov- Krasnodar‚ÄìTuapse; Yurovsky‚ÄìAnapa 2003 ‚Äì the Baikal‚ÄìAmur mainline; 2013 ‚Äì Adler‚ÄìRosa Farm 2016 ‚Äì Moscow Central Ring 2017 ‚Äì The railway line bypassing Ukraine 2017 ‚Äì the Amur‚ÄìYakutsk railway. 2019 ‚Äì Railway bridge to the Crimea 2023 ‚Äì BCM Moscow‚ÄìKazan (draft) 2023 ‚Äì Northern Latitudinal Railway (project) 2030 ‚Äì Magadan Highway (Lower Bestyah‚ÄìMoma‚ÄìMagadan) (project) Statistics Russian Railways accounts for 2.5%Lenta.RU News \\"–†–ñ–î –ø–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏–ª–∞ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ –∑–∞–Ω—è—Ç—å—Å—è —Å–ø–∞—Å–µ–Ω–∏–µ–º –∂–µ–ª–µ–∑–Ω—ã—Ö –¥–æ—Ä–æ–≥\\" (RZD asks government to rescue the railway) of Russia's GDP and employs 800,000 people.

Industrial railways Besides the common-carrier railways that are well covered by government statistics there are many industrial railways (such as mining or lumbering railways) whose statistics are covered separately, and which in 1981 had a total length almost equal to the length of the common carrier railways.–ü–ª–∞–∫—Å, p.5 –†e–∑–µ—Ä p. 5 Currently (2008) they are only about half the length of the common-carrier system.Industrial Railroad Statistics In 1980, about two- thirds of their freight flowed to and from the common-carrier railroads while the remaining third was internal transport only on an industrial railways.–†e–∑–µ—Ä pp. 25-6 (For example, a lumber company uses its private industrial railways to transport logs from a forest to its sawmill.)

The Sakhalin Railway, on Sakhalin Island used 1,067mm Cape gauge from its construction under Japan until 2019, when the conversion to 1520mm completed. A section from the Poland‚ÄìRussia border to Kaliningrad, uses the 1,435mm Standard gauge. Unlike the Sakhalin Railway, which carries freight and passengers, the standard-gauge line in Kaliningrad carries only freight at this time. Kaliningrad's tram network also uses metre-gauge tracks at 1,000mm, as does Stavropol krai's Pyatigorsk network. Railway universities There are many railway colleges in Russia which are higher educational institutes that train students for railway careers, mainly in engineering. Command and control system Since 2010 Russian Railways had started an overhaul of its computer systems. The overhaul will centralize the management of data into new computing hubs, restructure the collection of information on the railway's field operations, and integrate new automation software to help the railway strategise how to deploy its assets. The geriatric machines that the new mainframes will replace include Soviet-built clones of IBM's Cold War‚Äìera computers, called ES EVM (the transliterated Russian acronym for \\"unified system of electronic computing machines\\").IEEE Spectrum's special report: Winners & Losers VII: IBM overhauls Russian Railways' software infrastructure, p. 123 By Sandria Upson, Jan. 2010.

In 1596 he sent unsuccessful expeditions to conquer Cambodia and Mindanao. P√©rez Dasmari√±as was a knight of the Order of Alc√°ntara. His father, G√≥mez P√©rez Dasmari√±as, was governor of the Philippines from 1590 to 1593. Expedition to the Moluccas In 1593, G√≥mez P√©rez Dasmari√±as (the father) led a Spanish expedition from Manila to capture the fort at Terrenate, in the Moluccas. He had planned this expedition for some time, but in secret, and did not reveal his intention until most of the preparations had been made. He intended to lead the expedition personally. Before he set sail, he sent his son, Luis P√©rez Dasmari√±as, on ahead with part of the fleet to the province of Pintado. Luis P√©rez was second in command of the expedition, with the title of captain general. G√≥mez P√©rez left the military affairs of Manila and the rest of the Philippines in charge of Diego Ronquillo, and civil affairs in charge of Pedro de Rojas. After his son left, he remained briefly in Manila, making final preparations and arming a galley of 28 benches, in which he was to sail. This galley he manned with good Chinese rowers, with pay. According to Antonio de Morga, in order to win the good will of the rowers, he would not allow them to be chained, and even winked at their carrying certain weapons.Morga, Antonio de, Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas, chapter 5. About forty Spanish embarked on the galley, and the galley itself was accompanied by a few frigates and smaller vessels, in which private individuals embarked. The entire fleet consisted of 200 sail, counting galleys, galliots, frigates, virays and other craft. More than 900 Spanish were on the expedition. The governor set sail from Cavite for Pintados in October 1593, to join the part of the fleet under Luis P√©rez already at Pintados. They were then to proceed to the Moluccas. Mutiny and death of the governor On the second day of this first leg of the expedition, the governor's fleet reached the island of Caca, 24 leagues from Manila and just off the coast of Luzon. The Chinese rowers had been plotting for three days to seize the galley, and this night was their opportunity. In the last watch before dawn, they attacked the guards and the sleeping Spaniards, killing most of them, although a few escaped by swimming or in the galley's tender. Upon hearing the commotion, Governor Dasmari√±as carelessly left his cabin, and was killed by several Chinese waiting outside the door. Two Spaniards, Juan de Cuellar, the governor's secretary, and Franciscan Father Montilla, survived by remaining in their cabin amidships. They were later released ashore by the rebels. The rebels then made for China, but were unable to arrive there. Instead they reached Cochin China, where the king confiscated the two cannons aboard, the Royal Banner, and all the items of value (jewels, money, etc.). The rebels were dispersed to different places and the galley was abandoned. A few of the rebels were later captured in Malacca and sent back to Manila, where \\"justice was dealt them.\\" The choice of a new governor Governor G√≥mez P√©rez had brought with him to the Philippines a royal order directing him to choose a temporary successor in the event of his death. He had shown this order to various prominent Spaniards in the colony, implying to each that he was the designated successor. In particular, both the governor's son and conquistador Captain Estevan Rodr√≠guez de Figueroa expected the appointment. Rodr√≠guez was with the governor on the expedition to the Moluccas. Both he and Luis P√©rez hurried back to Manila to take command of the colony. Meanwhile, news of the seizure of the galley had arrived in Manila. The citizens and soldiers who had remained there assembled at the house of Licentiate Pedro de Rojas to discuss what to do. First they elected Rojas governor and captain general. Then they sent two frigates in pursuit of the galley, but they were unable to find it. Rojas also sent a message to Luis P√©rez in Pintados, informing him of Rojas's election and ordering him to return immediately to Manila, as the city had been left nearly defenseless. Rojas also began a search of the governor's papers to find the document naming his successor. The papers had been deposited in the Augustinian monastery in Manila, but the prior, not trusting Rojas, had secretly removed the document. About 40 days after the election of Rojas, Luis P√©rez and Estevan Rodr√≠guez arrived together in the harbor, with many men. They did not disembark, and P√©rez ordered another search for the missing document. This was now found, and it named P√©rez as his father's successor. The city magistrates then withdrew recognition of Rojas, and turned over the government to P√©rez. This was seconded by P√©rez's soldiers, and by the fleet. Rojas left office, having governed for 40 days. Pedro de Rojas was promoted to alcalde in Mexico City, and Antonio de Morga was named as his replacement in the Philippines, with increased authority. (Rojas had been lieutenant assessor in judicial matters, but Morga was also lieutenant governor of the colony.) Morga sailed from Acapulco, New Spain on March 22, 1595, arriving at Cavite on June 11 of the same year. Arrival of the Chinese Mandarins Not many days after the return of the fleet, there arrived in Manila many Chinese ships, ostensibly for trade. However, they carried many men and little merchandise, with seven Mandarins bearing the insignia of their office. This led to the suspicion on the part of the Spaniards that the Chinese had heard of the departure of most of the Spanish forces for the Moluccas, and had sent a fleet to try to conquer the nearly defenseless islands. However, seeing the city as strongly defended as ever, the Chinese made no hostile moves. They returned to China without showing any particular motive for the journey, and without either side mentioning the apparent motive. Expedition to Cambodia In 1594 news was received in Manila that the king of Siam had invaded and conquered Cambodia. King Langara of Cambodia had been forced to flee to Laos. P√©rez Dasmari√±as was persuaded by Spanish and Portuguese who had been in Cambodia that the kingdom could be easily reconquered, and doing so would gain the Spanish a foothold on the mainland of Asia. The governor ordered the dispatch of one vessel of moderate size and two junks, with 120 Spaniards and some Japanese and Filipinos. This expedition sailed at the beginning of 1596. The flagship became separated from the two junks. The junks arrived in Cambodia only to find that the Cambodians had already driven out the Siamese. One of the anti-Siamese leaders, Anacaparan, had declared himself king. The Spanish decided this was a favorable opportunity, but they would await the arrival of their flagship before taking action. Nevertheless, an altercation occurred with Chinese traders in port, and the Spanish took up arms against them, killing some. This led to a confrontation with the new king, whom the Spaniards also defeated, burning much of his capital in the process.Ibid. At about this time in 1597, the flagship of the expedition finally arrived in Cambodia. The commander refused the entreaties of his subordinates to restore King Langara to the throne, and sailed for the Philippines. In 1599, Malay Muslim merchants defeated and massacred almost the entire contingent of Spanish troops in Cambodia, putting an end to the Spanish plans to conquer it in the Cambodian‚ÄìSpanish War. Expedition to Mindanao Captain Estevan Rodr√≠guez de Figueroa had made an agreement with Governor G√≥mez P√©rez Dasmari√±as to conquer the island of Mindanao at his own expense, for the right to rule it for two lifetimes. This agreement was confirmed in Spain and an order sent to go ahead. In February 1596, Rodr√≠guez set out with 214 Spaniards and many Filipinos in some galleys, galleots, frigates, virays, barangays and lapis to begin his conquest. He soon reached the Mindanao River, where he was joined by the men of two native settlements, Tancapan and Lumaguan. He now commanded about 6,000 men. The combined force now proceeded to Buhahayen, principal town of the island and the capital of the most important chief. Buhahayen was well fortified. Shortly after their arrival the Spanish were involved in a skirmish with the natives. Rodr√≠guez was still aboard his flagship, but seeing that the Spanish were faring badly, he left the ship with a few men to take command. In order to travel more quickly, he was not wearing his helmet. Before he reached the scene of the skirmish, a single native surprised him, giving him a blow on the head with a sword. Rodr√≠guez was taken back to the ship, where he died the next day. Thus ended the first lifetime of his rule of Mindanao. The Spanish, with Juan de la Xara now in charge, retreated to the more friendly Tancapan, where they built a fort and a Spanish settlement named Murcia. After serving as governor Luis P√©rez Dasmarinas was still awaiting word of the expeditions to Cambodia and Mindanao when news was received that the new governor, Francisco de Tello de Guzm√°n, was arriving. Tello de Guzm√°n had been sent from Spain. He took over the government on July 14, 1596. Luis P√©rez made one expedition to Cambodia in person after his term as governor ended, but his ship was blown off course by a storm and he ended up in El Pi√±al on the Chinese coast. He drew the ire from Portuguese Macau nearby and was attacked by the Portuguese. Aborting the expedition to Cambodia, he returned to Manila. He was killed by Chinese rebels in the Sangley rebellion in 1603, who mounted the Spanish heads they chopped off throughout Manila.

The Department oversees all aspects of the Airport from Airport Management, to Fixed-Base Operations, to Airport Maintenance. The OSU Airport is a Part 139 Certificated Airport, serving as a general aviation reliever for the nearby John Glenn Columbus International Airport. The OSU Airport is home to 160 aircraft, including single- and multi- engine, piston, and turbine engine aircraft and rotorcraft. It oversees about 71,000 operations per year and generally ranks in the top five airports in Ohio in the number of take-offs and landings with Cleveland Hopkins, John Glenn Columbus, Dayton, and Cincinnati Lunken.

The story is set in Hong Kong in 1938 and in Shanghai in 1942, when it was occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army and ruled by the puppet government led by Wang Jingwei. It depicts a group of Chinese university students from The University of Hong Kong who plot to assassinate a high-ranking special agent and recruiter working for the puppet government, by using one of their group, an attractive young woman, to lure him into a honey trap. The film is generally accepted to be based on the historical event of Chinese spy Zheng Pingru's failed attempt to assassinate the Japanese collaborator Ding Mocun. With this film, Lee won the Golden Lion Award at the Venice Film Festival for the second time, the first being with Brokeback Mountain.The awards of the Venice Film Festival on the Festival's site The film adaptation and the story are loosely based on events that took place during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai. The film's explicit sex scenes resulted in the film being rated NC-17 in the United States. Title The title of the work, Lust, Caution, has a double meaning in Chinese. The character for \\"lust\\" (Ëâ≤, s√®) can be read as \\"colour\\", while \\"caution\\" (Êàí, ji√®) can be read as \\"ring\\", therefore the title can also read as \\"colourful ring\\", an object that plays a pivotal role in the story. The two alternate readings of the title are interwoven into a cautionary tale of lust and love through the symbolic use of the ring. Plot Hong Kong 1938 During the Second Sino- Japanese War, a shy, inexperienced university student, Wong Chia Chi, travels from Shanghai to Hong Kong and attends her first year at Lingnan University. A male student, Kuang Yu Min, invites her to join his patriotic drama club, and soon she becomes a lead actress, inspiring both her audience and her colleagues. Inspired by the troupe's patriotic plays, Kuang persuades the group to make a more concrete contribution to the war against Japan. He devises a plan to assassinate Mr. Yee, a special agent and recruiter of the puppet government of Wang Jingwei set up by the Japanese occupation in China. The beautiful Chia Chi is chosen to take on the undercover role of \\"Mrs. Mai\\", the elegant wife of a trading company owner. She manages to insert herself into the social circle of Mrs. Yee. Chia Chi catches the eye of Mr. Yee and tries to lure him to a location where he can be assassinated. Chia Chi is still a virgin, and she reluctantly consents to having sex with another student involved in the plot, in order to practice her role as a married woman if she were to sleep with Yee. Kuang, who has feelings for Chia Chi, is upset by this, but agrees to the arrangement. Attracted to Chia Chi, Yee nearly falls for the trap but withdraws at the last minute. Soon after, Mr. and Mrs. Yee suddenly move back to Shanghai, leaving the students with no further chance to complete their assassination plan. While they are preparing to disband, an armed subordinate of Yee turns up unannounced and tells them that he is aware of their plans. After a violent struggle, the university students kill the subordinate and then go into hiding. Shanghai 1942 Chinese spy Zheng Pingru, generally believed to have been the inspiration for the story Three years later in Japanese-occupied Shanghai, Chia Chi again encounters Kuang, who is now an undercover agent of the Kuomintang (KMT) secret service the Juntong, which is seeking to overthrow the Japanese occupation forces and their puppet government. He enlists her into a renewed assassination plan to kill Yee. By this time, Yee has become the head of the secret police department under the puppet government and is responsible for capturing and executing Chinese resistance agents who are working for the KMT. Chia Chi is trained to use weapons and other spy tools. Her advances to become Yee's mistress are apparently reciprocated, and during their first sexual encounter, Yee violently rapes Chia Chi. Over the next few weeks, their sexual relationship becomes more intense and causes conflicting feelings in Chia Chi, who is still involved in the assassination plot. When Chia Chi reports to her KMT superior officer, she exhorts him to carry out the assassination soon so that she will not have to continue her sexual liaisons with Yee, but she is told that the assassination needs to be delayed for strategic reasons. Chia Chi describes the inhuman emotional conflict she is in, sexually and emotionally bound to a man whom she is plotting to assassinate. When Yee sends Chia Chi to a jewelry store with a sealed envelope, she discovers that he has arranged for a large and extremely rare six-carat pink diamond for her, to be mounted in a ring. This provides the Chinese resistance with a chance to get at Yee when he is not accompanied by his bodyguards. Soon after, Chia Chi invites Yee to accompany her to collect the diamond ring. While entering the jewelry shop, she notices that all her friends involved in the assassination plot are undercover outside. When she puts on the ring, she is overcome by emotion and quietly urges him to leave. Understanding her meaning, Yee immediately flees the shop and escapes the assassination attempt. By the end of the day, most of the resistance group are captured. Yee's deputy was aware of the resistance cell, but did not inform Yee because he hoped to use the opportunity to catch their leader. Emotionally in turmoil, Yee signs their death warrants and the resistance group members, including Chia Chi, are led out to a quarry and executed. As all the members of the resistance group are forced to their knees while the executioners take out their pistols, a sad Kuang gazes at her. Meanwhile, Yee sits on Chia Chi's empty bed in the family guest room while his wife asks him what is going on, since his secretary and two men had taken Chia Chi's belongings and some papers from his office. Yee tells her to keep quiet and to continue playing downstairs, to avoid letting anyone know that something is amiss. If anyone asks, he says, Chia Chi has returned to Hong Kong.

It was released in U.S. theaters on September 28, 2007, where it was rated NC-17 by the Motion Picture Association of America due to some explicit sex scenes. Lee stated that he would make no changes to attempt to get an R rating. After the movie's premiere, director Ang Lee was displeased that Chinese news media (including those from Taiwan) had greatly emphasized the sex scenes in the movie. The version released in the People's Republic of China was cut by about seven minutes (by the director himself) to make it suitable for younger audiences, since China has no rating system. The version released in Malaysia was approved by the Film Censorship Board of Malaysia without alterations and was rated 18SX‚Äîthose under 18 are barred from the cinema. His earlier film Brokeback Mountain is banned in Malaysia and banned in China due to homosexuality. It was released on DVD in 2008 with an R-rating since rental outlets and stores do not carry NC-17 titles.

The ten minutes of sex scenes were considered by Lee to be critical to the story and reportedly took 100 hours to shoot. In a number of countries, notably the People's Republic of China and India, many of the sex scenes had to be cut before the film could be released. In Singapore, while the film's producers initially decided to release a cut version there which was given an NC-16 rating, a public outcry stating that the producers of the film were underestimating censorship standards in the country (the film was released uncut in Hong Kong and Taiwan) prompted them to eventually release the uncut version with the higher R21 rating in Singapore. The film is rated R18 and was released uncut in New Zealand.http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid;=10488493 The following scenes were cut from the mainland China version: # Wong Chia Chi walking past dead refugees in the street # Stabbing scene cut to only one knife stab # Two of the sex scenes featuring the student, and three featuring Mr. Yee # A nude shot of Wong Chia Chi at window # Wong Chia Chi in bed after first sex scene with Mr. Yee # Dialogue modified in diamond ring scene so that Wong Chia Chi did not betray the resistance by warning Mr. Yee.Lee admits 'political edit' of film The film's end credits ends with a 18 U.S.C ¬ß 2257 notice.The notice reads: \\"18 U.S.C ¬ß 2257 records custodian ‚Äì Joyce Hsieh, custodian of records, Mr. Yee Productions LLC, C/O Schreck Rose Dapello Adams & Hurwitz LLP, 1790 Broadway, New York, NY 10019.

All print ads and feature content using Tang were removed, and her endorsements were discontinued. She was set to star in Tian Zhuangzhuang's budget period film The Warrior and the Wolf (2009), but was replaced by Maggie Q.\\"Maggie Q to star in 'Wolf'\\" Variety. 25 September 2008. In February 2009, during her absence from the movie industry, she was reported to have briefly attended drama classes at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom. =Country of production= The film was co- produced by the American companies Focus Features and River Road Productions, and Chinese companies Shanghai Film Group Corporation and Haishang Films and the Taiwanese Hai Sheng Film Production Company. The director is Ang Lee, who is a naturalized U.S. citizen, and the actors/actresses are from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan as well as the United States. It was shot in Shanghai, the neighboring province of Zhejiang, Hong Kong (at Hong Kong University), and some locations in Penang and Ipoh in Malaysia used as 1930s/1940s Hong Kong. Originally, the film's country was identified as \\"China-USA\\" by the organizers of the Venice Film Festival. However, a few days later, the Venice Film Festival changed the film to \\"USA-China-Taiwan, China\\" on its official schedule. When the film premiered at the event, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council protested the Venice event's use of \\"Taiwan, China\\" to identify films from the island and blamed China for the move. After the film's premiere, Taiwan submitted the film as its Best Foreign Film Oscar entry. However, the Oscars asked Taiwan to withdraw the film because some key crew members were not locals. Oscars spokeswoman Teni Melidonian said in an e-mail organizers refused to accept the film because \\"an insufficient number of Taiwanese participated in the production of the film,\\" violating a rule that requires foreign countries to certify their locals \\"exercised artistic control\\" over their submission. =Defamation= On September 13, 2007, an elderly lady, Zheng Tianru, staged a press conference in Los Angeles, claiming that the movie was about real-life events that happened in World War II, and wrongfully portrayed her older sister, Zheng Pingru, as a promiscuous secret agent who seduced and eventually fell in love with the assassination target Ding Mocun (she alleges that the characters were renamed to Wong Chia Chi and Mr. Yee in the movie). Taiwan's investigation bureau confirmed that Zheng Pingru failed to kill Ding Mocun because her gun jammed, rather than developing a romantic relationship with the assassin's target. Director Ang Lee maintains that Eileen Chang wrote the original short story as fiction. Critical reception On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 72% based on 147 reviews, with a weighted average of 6.63/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"Ang Lee's Lust, Caution is a tense, sensual and beautifully-shot espionage film\\". On Metacritic, the film had an average score of 61 out of 100, based on 35 reviews. Jack Mathews of the New York Daily News named it the 5th best film of 2007. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times named it the 6th best film of 2007. The Chinese press gave generally positive reviews. In analyzing how successful Lee's film was as an adaptation of Eileen Chang's short story, literary critic Leo Ou-fan Lee wrote in Muse Magazine that he 'found [his] loyalties divided between Eileen Chang and Ang Lee. But after three viewings of the film, I have finally opted for Lee because deep down I believe in film magic which can sometimes displace textual fidelity.' In an earlier issue of Muse however, film critic Perry Lam had criticized Lee's direction: 'in his eagerness to make the movie appealing to a mass audience, Lee seems guilty of sentimentalism.' Sentimental or not, there is certainly a palpable trace of Lee's sympathy for Chang's personal love life, \\"It was hard for me to live in Eileen Chang's world...There are days I hated her for it. It's so sad, so tragic. But you realize there's a shortage of love in her life: romantic love, family love.\\" He added, \\"This is the story of what killed love for her.\\" =Anachronisms= It has been noted by critics (including Bryan Appleyard) that the Hong Kong sequences in the film set in the late 1930sSee (5.2 MB) include \\"London taxis\\" of two types (FX3, FX4) that were only manufactured onwards from 1948 and 1958 respectively. The film also features Japanese orthography that wasn't used before 1946 in a classroom scene. Box office Lust, Caution was produced on a budget of approximately $15 million. In Hong Kong, where it played in its entirety, Lust, Caution grossed US$6,249,342 (approximately $48 million HKD) despite being saddled with a restrictive \\"Category III\\" rating. It was the territory's biggest-grossing Chinese language film of the year, and third biggest overall (behind only Spider-Man 3 and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix). The film was also a box office success in China, despite playing only in a heavily edited version. It grossed US$17,109,185, making it the country's fifth highest-grossing film of 2007 and third highest-grossing domestic production. In North America, the NC-17 rating which Lust, Caution received is traditionally perceived as a box office \\"kiss-of-death\\". In its opening weekend in one U.S. theatre, it grossed $63,918. Expanding to seventeen venues the next week, its per-screen average was $21,341, before cooling down to $4,639 at 125 screens. Never playing at more than 143 theatres in its entire U.S. run, it eventually grossed $4,604,982. As of August 15, 2008, it was the fifth highest-grossing NC-17 production in North America. Focus Features was very satisfied with the United States release of this film. Worldwide, Lust, Caution grossed $67,091,915. Home media In the United States, two DVD versions of this film were released: the original NC-17 version and the censored R-rated version. This film has generated more than $24 million from its DVD sales and rentals in the United States, https://web.archive.org/web/20170228015430/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=homevideo&id;=lustcaution.htm an impressive result for a film that only grossed $4.6 million in limited theatrical release in the United States.

Geographic range The Florida softshell turtle is found primarily in the state of Florida, but it also ranges to southern sections of South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama.Apalone ferox (Schneider, 1783). USGS. It is the only species of softshell turtle whose range spans the entire Florida peninsula.Meylan, P.A. and Moler, P.E. 2006. Apalone ferox ‚Äì Florida Softshell Turtle. In: P.A. Meylan (ed.), Biology and Conservation of Florida Turtles, pp. 160‚Äì168. Chelonian Research Foundation, Lunenburg, MA. = Habitat use = The Florida softshell turtle is a widespread species and occupies almost every freshwater habitat, even tolerating some brackish environments; however, it is not often found in water with strong currents, preferring habitats with slow-moving or still water. These different habitats include swamps, lakes, marshes, wet prairies, small rivers, creeks, and even ponds formed in man-made ditches or sinkholes.Duellman W.e., and Schwartz, A. 1958.

Florida softshell turtle (Apalone ferox) close-up Countershading in Florida softshell turtle (A. ferox) Juvenile coloration in Florida softshell turtle (A ferox) Close-up of head of the Florida softshell turtle Description The Florida softshell turtle is a large turtle with a flattened, pancake-like body, a long neck, an elongated head with a long snorkel-like nose, and large webbed feet, each with three claws. While most turtles have hard shells composed of scutes, the Florida softshell has a cartilaginous carapace covered in leathery skin. Ranging from olive green to dark brown, it has the darkest coloration of all the softshell species that inhabit Florida (other species include Apalone mutica calvata and Apalone spinifera aspera). It is also characterized by a white or cream-colored underside.Apalone. www.tortoise.org This color pattern is known as countershading and is a form of camouflage to conceal turtles from potential predators.\\"Heron tries to swallow turtle for dinner\\". The Daily Telegraph. 18 December 2009. It is also the largest species of softshell turtle found in Florida and all of North America, ranging from 15 to 76 cm (5.9 to 29.9 in) in length. The Florida softshell also exhibits significant sexual size dimorphism. Adults females are often 3-5x larger than males. Males have a carapace length and body weight averaging about 35 cm (14 in) and 2.68 kg (5.9 lb) respectively. Nesting adult females were found to average in weight and measure in carapace length, with the record weight documented at .Meylan, P.A.; Schuler, R.; Moler, P. (2002). \\"Spermatogenic cycle of the Florida softshell turtle, Apalone ferox \\". Copeia 2002 (3): 779‚Äì786.Iverson, J.B.; Moler, P.E. (1997). \\"The female reproductive cycle of the Florida softshell turtle (Apalone ferox)\\". Journal of Herpetology 31 (3): 399‚Äì409. However, males tend to have longer tails than their female counterparts (3 cm longer than a female of the same size). Hatchlings have a lighter carapace with yellow and orange markings and a carapacial rim. Stripes in the same color are also found on the face and neck. Their plastron is generally dark in color. As the turtle ages, these colors fade and are lost, resulting in the dark-brown coloration characteristic of adults. Behavior The Florida softshell turtle is almost entirely aquatic, only emerging from the water to bask or to lay eggs. In the water, it prefers to bury itself in the sandy/muddy substrate. Like all softshells, it is very fast-moving in water and on land. While this species is omnivorous, its diet consists largely of meat, consuming mainly fish, insects, crustaceans, frogs and mollusks. It may also scavenge.  Reproduction  = Males = The reproductive cycle of male Florida softshell turtles follows a postnuptial pattern, with a cycle of spring mating followed by spermatogenesis in the fall. The male will produce sperm during the fall and store that sperm in the epididymides through the winter. This stored sperm can then be utilized for copulation during the following spring mating season. Evidence suggests that they undergo spermatogenesis every year. Males of this species reach sexual maturity at small sizes (below 0.7 kg), allowing them to begin reproducing quickly following birth. This implies that some males may be able to reproduce as young as two years of age. = Females = While males consistently reach sexual maturity at small sizes, that size is larger and more variable in females. Some may reach maturity at a plastron length of 24 cm, and others may not mature until they reach a length closer to 30 cm. The onset of sexual maturity will occur anywhere from 5 ‚Äì 8 years of age. The female nesting season can range anywhere from early April to early August, and incubation lasts an average of 60 ‚Äì 90 days. In a study examining female reproduction, almost 10% of the females examined in a single breeding season showed signs of inactive ovaries, implying that, unlike males, females may not possess the ability to reproduce every year. Florida softshell females have the ability to produce an average of 4 ‚Äì 5 egg clutches in a single breeding season, potentially producing a new clutch every three weeks. Florida softshell turtles have one of the highest annual egg production rates of any reptile. The study previously mentioned showed an average of over 20 eggs per clutch, with the largest clutch containing 38 eggs. Ecology With a primarily carnivorous diet, adult Florida softshell turtles function as major predators in their aquatic ecosystems. Sitting high on the trophic scale, they generally function as secondary or tertiary consumers.Aresco, M. J., and F. C. James. 2005. Ecological relationships of turtles in northern Florida lakes: a study of omnivory and the structure of a lake food web. Final report. Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, Tallahassee, Florida, USA. However, alligators have been known to prey on the adults of the Florida softshell turtle, and raptors may take juveniles. Nest predators include the fish crow, foxes, raccoons, skunks, and river otters. At various lakes across the state of Florida (Okeechobee, Apopka, Griffin, and Jesup) scientists have observed Florida softshell females, as well as other turtle species (Pseudemys nelsoni, Kinosternon sp., and Sternotherus odoratus) laying their eggs in American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) nests during the summer months. While the turtles may utilize vacant nests more often, they have also been known to lay eggs in occupied alligator nests. They use these nests more often in areas with limited nesting habitats and/or during years with heavier precipitation when high water levels and flooding further reduce the number of suitable nesting sites. Despite the Florida softshell's use of alligator nests, studies have shown the highest abundance of Florida softshell turtles to persist in lakes with little to no alligators as well as high primary productivity, suggesting a combination of top-down and bottom-up influences on softshell populations.Aresco, M. J. (2009). Environmental correlates of the abundances of three species of freshwater turtles in lakes of northern Florida. Copeia, 2009 (3), 545‚Äì555.  Anthropogenic threats  The Florida softshell turtle is common throughout Florida and other parts of its range. However, wild populations are subject to various threats at the hands of humans. Some of these threats include commercial harvesting for meat, harvesting for the pet trade, and roadway mortalities.ENGE, K.M. 1993.

Their musical style is rooted in the early to mid 1970s German electronic music era, often described as Berlin School, and transcends the genre using musical originality, multi-instrumentation, and complex harmonic arrangements using analogue sequencing. Their pieces are described as both exciting and haunting in equal measure, expressing strong central themes, and include contrasting atmospheres of rich sonic textures. Redshift music has been played on BBC TV and some listeners have likened certain pieces to film score, neo- industrial, as well as dark ambient. Listeners have commented on the hypnotic quality of the musical compositions. Their sound is largely dependent upon older synthesiser technology, notably instruments such as the Moog 3C which they combine with more recent digital technology. The basic technological philosophy of Redshift is to use analogue synthesis where possible, augmented where necessary by digitally sampled versions of hard-to-maintain analogue instruments such as the Mellotron. Redshift use analogue instruments manufactured by Moog, Yamaha, Oberheim, Korg, Roland, PPG, Analogue Systems, Doepfer, Modcan, Solina, and Fender Rhodes. Line up The band consists of Mark Shreeve, Julian Shreeve and James Goddard. Rob Jenkins was a band member from its inception in 1996 but left the band in 2002 after the Hampshire Jam 2 concert. James Goddard has been unable to perform as part of Redshift due to other commitments overseas since 2006, and Ian Boddy, long time peer of Mark Shreeve, has temporarily supported Mark and Julian Shreeve in performing 2006, 2008 and 2010 Redshift concerts in James‚Äôs absence., Interview with Mark Shreeve, 2010.

The quality is largely due to the technical expertise and influence of Mark Shreeve who enjoyed a successful commercial recording contract as a recording artist in the 1980s with Jive Records (Jive Electro) where he learned contemporary recording/production techniques from studio experts in Battery Studios, UK. Concerts Redshift live performances are rare due to the expense and logistics involved in taking older analogue gear on the road., Interview with Mark Shreeve, 2003. Up to 2012, Redshift had performed a total of seven live concerts, each time as the headline act, and with all of those performances subsequently being released as live albums. *Jodrell Bank Planetarium, United Kingdom (7 December 1996) *Alfa Centarui Festival, Netherlands (10 April 1999) *Hampshire Jam 2 Festival, United Kingdom (9 November 2002) *E-Live Festival, Eindhoven, Netherlands (9 October 2004) *Hampshire Jam 5 Festival, United Kingdom (21 October 2006) *Hampshire Jam 7 Festival, United Kingdom (15 November 2008) *Hampshire Jam 9 Festival, United Kingdom (13 November 2010) Music performances are carefully prepared for by the band whilst still allowing scope for skilled improvisation, e.g. fans attending their inaugural concert in Jodrell Bank Observatory in 1996 were treated to a completely improvised piece post-encore ‚Äì a piece none of the band had discussed or considered beforehand.

Retrieved 12-10-2010. and produced by Raymond J. Brune. Originally a two-hour program airing from 7-9 a.m., the show's emphasis was mostly on news, with very little on lighter features. With the emphasis on hard news, the show received poor ratings and some negative reviews.Memo to 'KTLA Morning News'--You Blew It, Los Angeles Times. Retrieved 12-10-2010. Near the end of 1991, Joel Tator, a new executive producer, had been brought in to help revive the show, by giving the show a more relaxed atmosphere by spreading out newspapers on the desk. The anchors, feeling that the show was in its final weeks, also relaxed and they started joking around. The critical moment for the Morning News came in February 1992, when a series of rain storms hit the Southland, causing severe flooding in the San Fernando Valley. At that time, the only other news programs on in the morning were the national news shows on ABC (Good Morning America), NBC (Today) and CBS (CBS This Morning), which were all broadcast on a three-hour tape delay in the Pacific Time Zone, with limited live coverage during the local news segments. Filling a need, KTLA set aside its normal programming and provided extensive coverage of the flooding. That brought in large numbers of Southland viewers; once the flood crisis ended, the viewers stayed with the show. And as a result, ratings improved dramatically. Another critical moment for the Morning News occurred on January 17, 1994, when the Northridge earthquake rocked the area, causing widespread damage, collapsing freeways, sparked power outages, ruptured water and gas lines, prompted the stoppage of television and film production, and altered public events and flight schedules due to precaution closures in Hollywood and Los Angeles International Airport. The quake almost trashed the KTLA newsroom when reporters Eric Spillman, Larry McCormick, Stan Chambers and Michele Ruiz were producing special reports throughout the morning. With the new relaxed atmosphere and a need to provide live, local news when the other stations could not, the show survived. The program continued to succeed even as the newscast saw new competition with the debut of Good Day L.A. on Fox-owned KTTV (channel 11) in July 1993.They Carry a Big Shtick; Television: KTTV is pitting 'Good Day, L.A.' against 'The KTLA Morning News.'

This meant that '2nd century' Judah Kyriakos was the last Christian Bishop of Jerusalem who happened to still have Jewish origins.) Judas Cyriacus and the True Cross The martyrdom of Judas Cyriacus. Judas Cyriacus by Palma il Giovane The local tradition of Ancona has identified this saint with the Jew named Judas Quiriacus or Kyriakos. According to legend, a Jew Judas Kyriakos aided the Empress Helena in finding the True Cross, which had been buried at Golgotha after the crucifixion. The oldest extant Syriac text of the legend of the discovery of the True Cross by Judas Kyriakos dates from c. 500 AD. Its recent editor and translator says that the manuscript is \\"of great value for the history of the legend of the inventio crucis\\". Sozomen (died c. 450 AD), in his Ecclesiastical History , states that it was said (by whom he does not say) that the location of the Holy Sepulchre was \\"disclosed by a Hebrew who dwelt in the East, and who derived his information from some documents which had come to him by paternal inheritance\\" (although Sozomen himself disputes this account) and that a dead person was also revived by the touch of the Cross. Later, popular versions of this story state that a Jew who assisted Helena was named Jude or Judas, but later converted to Christianity and took the name Kyriakos (kyriakos means \\"lordly\\" or \\"lord-like\\" in Greek). Among the three accounts about the discovery of the True Cross that circulated throughout the Roman Empire in the 4th century, the two most widely repeated both credited Helena, the aged mother of Constantine the Great, who travelled to Jerusalem at her son's request. To recover it, it was necessary to demolish a temple, perhaps dedicated to Venus, that occupied the site. In one, Judas knew of the location of the Cross; he had been the recipient of that secret knowledge which was handed down the paternal line of his family, and revealed it under torture. As J. W. Drijvers, the editor of the text, has noted, > The Judas Kyriakos legend originated in Greek, but became also known in > Latin and Syriac and later on in many vernacular languages. This version > relates how Helena discovered the Cross with the help of a Jew Judas, who > later converted and received the name Kyriakos. It became the most popular > version of the three. The martyrdom of Judas Cyriacus The body of Judas Cyriacus in the Cathedral of Ancona. After assisting Helena with the finding of the True Cross, Judas Cyriacus was baptized, consecrated as bishop of Jerusalem, and martyred during the persecutions of Julian the Apostate, which would place his death in the 4th century. Another saint, named Saint Cyriacus, died during this century, and there may have been confusion between the two saints. In the legendary Acts of his martyrdom, at first written in Greek and than translated in Latin and Syriac, he engages in a dialogue with the emperor Julian, and is described as suffering horrible torments, along with his mother Anna. The Empress Galla Placidia is said to have presented Ancona with the relics of Judas Cyriacus. However, the saint's head was situated at Provins, which was brought over from Jerusalem by Henry I of Champagne, who built a church in this town to contain it. This still stands as the Saint Quiriace Collegiate Church, although construction work during the 12th century was never completed due to financial difficulties during the reign of Philippe le Bel. A dome was added in the 17th century, and the old families of Provins who lived in the upper town were called \\"Children of the Dome.\\" Cathedral of San Ciriaco Monte Guasco, in Ancona, is the location of the Duomo, and is dedicated to Saint Judas Cyriacus. It is said to occupy the site of a temple of Venus, who is mentioned by Catullus and Juvenal as the tutelary deity of the place. It was consecrated in 1128 and completed in 1189. Some writers suppose that the original church was in the form of a Latin cross and belonged to the 8th century. An early restoration was completed in 1234. It is a fine Romanesque building in grey stone, built in the form of a Greek cross, with a dodecagonal dome over the center slightly altered by Margaritone d'Arezzo in 1270. The body purported to be Cyriacus' lies prostrate and visible in his tomb. See also * Saint Judas Cyriacus, patron saint archive References *J.W.

These fasting periods are exceeded by no other Christian community except the Orthodox Tewahedo. Out of the 365 days of the year, Copts often fast between 180 to 210 days.  Fasting  There are spiritual, symbolic, and even practical reasons for fasting. In the fall from Paradise man became possessed of a carnal nature; he adopted carnal practices. Through fasting, the Orthodox Christians attempt to recapture Paradise in their lives by refraining from those carnal practices. In general, Coptic fasting means adhering to a vegan diet, thus abstaining from meat, fish, eggs, dairy, and other animal products. There are those who see fasting as an exercise in self- denial and Christian obedience that serves to rid the believer of his or her passions (what most modern people would call \\"addictions\\"). These often low- intensity and hard-to-detect addictions to food, television or other entertainments, sex, or any kind of self-absorbed pleasure-seeking are seen as some of the most significant obstacles for man seeking closeness to God. Through struggling with fasting, the believer comes face to face with the reality of his condition - the starting point for genuine repentance. All Coptic Christians are expected to fast following a prescribed set of guidelines. Dispensation is however granted under special circumstances, such as pregnancy and sickness. The time and type of fast is generally uniform in Oriental Orthodoxy. The times of fasting are dependent on the ecclesiastical calendar. In the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, this calendar is the Coptic calendar, which corresponds largely to the calendars of other Christian denominations. Observance of the fasting periods is very strict in the Coptic community. Observation periods The major fasting periods during the ecclesiastical calendar year are: =The Fast of the Advent= The Nativity Fast (Advent or Winter Lent) is the 40 days preceding the Nativity of Jesus (Christmas) on 29 Koiak (January 7, which also falls on 28 Koiak in leap years). The 40 days correspond to the 40 days that the Moses fasted on the mountain before receiving the Ten Commandments from God, which were at that time considered the word of God to his people. Thus, with Christ being the Word of God, the Christians fast those 40 days in preparation of receiving the Word of God in flesh at the Feast of the Nativity. An additional 3 days were added at the beginning of the 40 days of Advent during the 10th century to commemorate the three days that Copts fasted before God awarded them the miracle of moving the Mokattam, which lies within a suburb of Cairo, on the hands of Simon the Tanner during the rule of the Fatimid caliph al-Mu'izz li- Din Allah. Thus the fast of Advent begins on 16 Hathor (November 25, which also falls on 15 Hathor in leap years). The three added days are considered a separate fast rather than part of the fast of Advent. =The Fast of Nineveh= It commemorates the three days that the people of Nineveh fasted in repentance after Jonah's call for them to repent. For Christians, these three days are a direct parallel of and a prophecy about the three days that Christ spent in the tomb, just like the three days Jonah spent in the belly of the fish. The fast of Nineveh begins on a Monday, two weeks before the Monday that marks the beginning of Great Lent. This fast was borrowed from Syriac Christianity, as one of the Patriarchs of Alexandria of Syriac descent decided to adapt it for the Church of Alexandria. =The Fast of Great Lent= Great Lent consists of eight weeks (55 days), which correspond to the 40 days that Christ fasted on the mountain. With the remaining fifteen days for a week of preparation, the Holy Week which is the last week of fasting, and Lazarus Saturday. It precedes Palm Sunday, and the Holy Week, which precede Easter. The seven days of the Holy Week is also a period of rigorous fasting. There are an additional seven days of fasting before the beginning of the Great Lent, which serve as a preparatory period. Often called \\"Pre-Lenten Fast\\" or \\"Preparatory Week\\", and also what was explained before. =The Fast of the Holy Week- The Holy Pascha - Passion Week = This is the week preceding Easter, which climaxes with the Crucifixion on Good Friday and ends with the joyous Easter. Since they are not related to each other dogmatically, in early Christianity, the Great Lent fast and the Holy Week fast were fasted separately. It was later in Church history that the Fathers of the Church saw it as spiritually beneficial to join them concurrently, and later added the Preparatory week to enable the faithful to prepare themselves spiritually and bodily to experience the benefits of the fasts. =The Fast of the Apostles= The Apostles' Fast varies in length from two to six weeks (15 to 49 days). It begins on the Monday following the Sunday of Pentecost and extends to the feast day of Saint Peter and Paul the Apostle on 5 Epip (July 12). This fasting period commemorates the struggles of the Apostles to preach Christianity to the world. Its length varies yearly depending on the date of Easter, which in turn determines the date of Pentecost. The people who are fasting are allowed to eat vegan food and fish. =The Fast of the Dormition of the Mother of God = This fast is fifteen days long and precedes the feast of the Dormition of the Mother of God. This fasting period is fasted to ask for the intercessions of Mary, mother of Jesus. It begins on 1 Mesori (August 7) and ends on 16 Mesori (August 22). =Wednesday and Friday Weekly Fasts= Coptic Christians also fast every Wednesday in commemoration of Christ's betrayal by Judas Iscariot, and every Friday in commemoration of his crucifixion. Exceptions are the Wednesdays and Fridays between Easter and Pentecost (the 50-day period of joy during which fasting is not permitted) and any day whereon a Major Feast falls. =The Paramon Fasts= The day or days preceding the Feast of the Nativity and the Feast of Theophany is/are a fast day(s) in preparation for the Feast day. (See the rules for the fasting days of the Paramon Fasts) Rules =General dietary rules= According to the Coptic tradition of fasting periods, the diet is mainly vegan, cooked with either oil or water. No animal products (meat, poultry, fish, milk, eggs, butter, etc.) are allowed. Permissibles Fish is permissible during the Advent fast, the Apostles' Fast, and the fast of the Dormition of Saint Mary except on Wednesdays and Fridays of these fasts. Lent and the Holy Week fasts are stricter than the other fasts in their discipline. Those who wish to take a vow of strict discipline for the fast of Saint Mary may also do so. =Strict abstinence= A strict abstinence period, where no food or drink whatsoever may be taken, is encouraged for those who can endure it. The original tradition of the Church is for this period of abstinence to begin at midnight and last through sunset. Those who cannot endure this length of fast are still encouraged to strictly abstain from all types of food and drink between midnight and a certain time in the day, depending on each individual's strength and spiritual needs (this is usually based on the suggestion of the person's father of confession). For many parishioners, fasting is more likely to end at noon (the hour when Christ was placed on the Cross) or three o'clock on the afternoon (the hour when Christ died on the Cross). Strict abstinence is also expected to be kept on Great Friday between midnight and the end of the Great Friday prayers (usually around 6pm). =Regarding the Fast of the Paramon of the Feasts of the Nativity and of Theophany= * The Paramon Fast is a strict fasting day with abstinence and no fish preceding the Nativity or Theophany Feast. * If the Feast day falls on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday, then the Paramon is simply the day immediately preceding the Feast day. * If the Feast day falls on a Sunday, the Paramon abstinence day is substituted by the Friday before, since Saturday is a non-abstaining day. In this case, the Paramon Fast is considered as the two days, Friday and Saturday, with only Friday as a Paramon abstinence day. * If the Feast day falls on a Monday, then the Paramon abstinence day is similarly substituted with the Friday before, since Saturday and Sunday are non-abstaining days. In this case, the Paramon Fast is considered as the three days, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, with only Friday as a Paramon abstinence day. This is the only case where a third previous day is included in the Paramon Fast. * If the Feast day falls on Friday, then the Paramon Fast becomes a two-day fast since Wednesday is already a strict fasting day with abstinence. =Non-fasting periods= There are 7 weeks during the year where there is no fasting even on Wednesday and Friday. These are the 7 weeks between Easter and Pentecost. These 7 weeks are fast-free because this period is a period of joy for Christians in celebration of the Resurrection of Christ. =Abstinence Fasting observance before partaking of the Holy Communion= Coptic Orthodox Christians who expect to receive communion of the Eucharist on a certain day do not eat or drink at all during the nine hours preceding the partaking of the communion or from midnight of the previous night, whichever is longer. =Canonical observance= Strict fasting with abstinence is canonically forbidden on Saturdays and Sundays due to the festal character of the Sabbath and Resurrectional observances respectively. Holy (Bright) Saturday is the only Saturday of the year where a strict fast is kept. =Principle of piety= It is considered a greater sin to advertise one's fasting than to not participate in the fast. Fasting is a purely personal communication between the Orthodox Christian and God, and in fact has no place whatsoever in the public life of the Coptic Orthodox Church. Exceptions These strict fasting rules are usually relaxed by priests on an individual basis to accommodate for illness or weakness. Abstinence from sexual intercourse is also encouraged but not mandatory, and largely depends on the decision of each couple. The Coptic Orthodox fasting periods are designed to foster spiritual development and focus on liturgical practices. Fasting is not generally viewed as a hardship, but rather a privilege and joy in preparing for the coming ‚ÄúFeast Day‚Äù.

It is a commentary and evaluation of methods and techniques used by former Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson in their support of Civil Rights. The author, Mark Stern, is a professor of Political Science at University of South Florida, and has written multiple essays, short critiques and articles about the subject of the book. The book presents the idea that both Kennedy and Johnson were not very emotionally committed to the area and movement, although Johnson seems to have been more so than Kennedy, according to the book. This is demonstrated as the norm in politics, as most politicians, according to Stern, use crises and movements to advance their political stature and gain votes: 'Candidates need policy proposals in order to gain votes'.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed March 15, 2011 coastal stream in northern California which flows entirely within San Mateo County and discharges to the Pacific Ocean. Its waters rise on the west facing slopes of the Montara Mountain, block and its mouth is at the unincorporated community of Moss Beach, within the Fitzgerald Marine Reserve. Historically there was a tidal marsh at its mouth, but some of this reach has been degraded by fill, especially in the construction of West Point Drive. This westernmost reach of the creek has been especially ecologically productive, and part of the reason for Fitzgerald Marine Reserve's designation on August 5, 1969 as a state reserve and was named after James V. Fitzgerald. History The streambanks of San Vicente Creek were inhabited by Native American as early as 3800 BC. The first European land exploration of Alta California, the Spanish Portol√° expedition, passed through the area on its way north, camping near the creek on October 30, 1769. In the year 1933, discovery of the rare plant Hickman's potentilla was made in the lower stream reach, but the species is not known to have existed past the 1970s at this location.

Annie is played by Kelsey Batelaan. Character history Annie first appears on the show in the pilot episode. Here she is shown as going back to school, allowing her mother Julia to go back to medical school. She also adopts the class pet gerbil, Frisky. Julia later kills the pet but does not tell Annie, buying a new one. In Season 2, Annie, at the age of 8, starts puberty. Annie's friend's mother throws Annie a \\"Princess Menses\\" party and invites her friends to celebrate the passage to womanhood. In Season 3 Annie has to talk to Family Services about her father Sean's anger problem. She leads them to believe, unintentionally, that he may be physically abusive and that he has emotionally affected her. She is briefly taken away from Sean until further notice. She is then put to stay with Julia. In season 4 Annie learns her mother is going to give birth to a boy with syndactyly, a webbing of the fingers and toes. Annie, in a sincere attempt to understand this birth defect, tapes her fingers together to understand how her brother would feel and alters her doll hands to have the same appearance. Sean and Julia interpret this as mockery, and Julia forces Annie to throw out her modified toys which she finds offensive. Julia gives birth to a boy, Conor, and Annie is uncomfortable with him because of his handicap. She is taken away by her mother when Julia leaves for New York City towards the end of the season. In Season 5, Annie is living with Julia, her new girlfriend Olivia Lord, and her sociopathic daughter Eden. Eden, under the guise of being a caring \\"older sister\\", encourages Annie to lose weight to attract the attention of a boy she likes. She even asks Sean to perform liposuction on her, but he forbids it. After a failed attempt at inducing bulimia, Eden encourages Annie to move onto \\"Plan C\\"; the next day Sean gets a call from Julia saying Annie has been expelled from her school for being caught performing fellatio on the boy she has a crush on. Sean, knowing Eden put her up to it, threatens Eden to stay away from her and him. In the final episode of the season, Annie is seriously hurt by a car crash with Sean's friend Christian Troy when they are trying to escape the paparazzi. She is being operated on by Sean in the last scene. In Season 6, Annie is now a teenager and is openly resentful against her parents after their separation. Things are made worse after Sean abruptly marries Teddy. During a visit with her father, Sean discovers that Annie has been pulling her hair out and ingesting it (a stress reaction known as \\"Rapunzel Syndrome\\"). Annie suffers a severe abdominal cramp due to the ingested hair and underwent surgery to remove it. Soon afterwards Sean decided to double his life insurance policy and made Annie and Connor the sole beneficiaries (Matt was not included because he wasted the money Sean gave him from selling his house in Miami). Teddy attempts to kill Annie, Connor, and Sean in order to get the insurance money, but fails. =Future (Sean's dream)= In the episode \\"Conor McNamara, 2026\\", Annie is 30 years old (played by Jennifer Elise Cox). Years of being the ignored middle child and separation from her father has resulted in her being afflicted with severe personality problems. She is bulimic, extremely jealous of her brother, and is caught stealing painkillers from the hospital where Conor is having his surgery. She attempts to shock her family by dating an African-American bisexual man and announcing at dinner that she just had an abortion. Throughout the episode she also chain-smokes and mentions several of the incidents above such as when Julia flushed her gerbil, throwing away her dolls, the party for her period, and Sean running out on the family. In the Season 5: part two premiere, \\"Ronny Chase\\", Sean reveals that the events of \\"Conor McNamara, 2026\\" was a dream he had during his break-up with Julia.

Despite the steep cliff paths and rocky surrounding, Bovisand features two beaches, a holiday park, privately owned bungalows and a diving centre at Fort Bovisand. The area, in the vicinity of Plymouth and Wembury, is used predominantly by locals, while tourists prefer the larger and better-known beaches elsewhere. It is often referred to as simply Bovi by locals. It lies just outside the boundaries of the city of Plymouth and instead within the district of South Hams. There are two beaches at Bovisand, the first named Bovisand Bay is the northernmost separated from the southernmost, Crownhill Bay, by rocks and a grass bank, commonly known as \\"Grassy\\". Both beaches are accessible only by steps, and are served by a cafe and a small tourist shop, but have no lifeguards. During the summer months, Plymouth coach company Target Travel run an hourly bus, the number 54, to Bovisand via Staddon Heights, and so the bus stop is only accessible from the beach by steps.

It allows for all one- and two-suited hands to be shown, and - for one suited hands - retains the ability to transfer. History The name of the convention is derived from the names two of its inventors, Jerry Helms and Bill Lohmann. Jerry Helms had previously co-developed \\"Helms\\", similar to the Cappelletti convention and saw this as an improvement to that convention. Helms considered that using 2 to show a major used up no bidding space and therefore lost the preemptive value typically attached to bidding major suits. Description It features the following calls: *Double is for penalty *2 shows diamonds or a major-minor two suiter. Responder transfers to 2 which is either passed or advanced (diamond suit) or a major is bid (2 suiter, unspecified minor) *2 is a transfer to hearts *2 shows both majors (responder may pass or correct to 2) *2 shows spades (natural bid) *2NT is a transfer to clubs *3 shows both minors (responder may pass or adjust to 3) *3 shows both Majors with massive playing strength (responder takes a preference to 3 or 3, or jumps to 4 or 4 with supporting values) By design, in many cases, the advancer will become declarer, thus placing the strong 1NT hand on opening lead.

The attendees were people of all ages, and were mostly members of organizations from around the Southeastern United States dealing with issues of racism, economic justice, globalization, and inequality. About 30% of attendees were black, about 30% were white, and about 30% were Latino or Latina. The purpose of the gathering was twofold. First, the gathering was designed to plan and build momentum for the first-ever US Social Forum. An event that was held in Atlanta, Georgia in June 2007. Second, the gathering was designed to bring together activists, organizers, indigenous people, working people, and people of color from around the Southeast United States in order to build informal and formal networks that could unite around common goals of social justice. Organizations from about 15 states were represented at the event. History and background The Southeast Social Forum grew out of the World Social Forum process that began in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 2001. Between 2001 and 2006, the Social Forum process had spread to numerous countries around the world. However, some organizers in the World Social Forum process had felt that the United States was not ready for a Social Forum‚Äîalthough this belief was contested, and ultimately disproven by the success of the Boston Social Forum in July 2004. It was eventually decided that there was a definite need to begin a national Social Forum process in the US, since many social justice activists believe that the world's most serious social problems are being continually worsened by the policies of the US government and US companies. The US Social Forum in Atlanta was originally slated for 2006, but following Hurricane Katrina, it was moved to 2007 and organizers decided that a 2006 gathering would take place somewhere in the Southeast to help build momentum toward the 2007 event. Atlanta, Knoxville, and Durham were considered as sites for the 2006 meeting. A group of organizers in Durham agreed to commit to help host the event. This group, which became known as the North Carolina Local Host Committee, met from January to June 2006 to plan the event. Much of the planning for the event outside of North Carolina took place in Atlanta, where efforts were spearheaded by Project South. Organizers frequently rejected the designations \\"event\\" and \\"conference\\" for the gathering, stating that the Southeast Social Forum is most appropriately considered a step in the process of movement- building. Details of the Gathering About 5% of the gathering's attendees spoke Spanish but not English, and translation services were provided at most points in the program for these attendees. While foundations supplied some support for the event, nearly all of the work that went into the process was done by volunteers. The event included workshops and plenary sessions dealing with topics such as building alliances among groups, combatting white supremacy, organizing against corporate globalization, and many other topics. The 3-day gathering was followed on June 19 by a smaller meeting of about 40 people specifically focused on planning for the 2007 US Social Forum in Atlanta.

This song has also survived as a late seventeenth-century English broadside ballad, and is one of several ballads about the medieval folk hero that form part of the Child ballad collection, which is one of the most comprehensive collections of traditional English ballads. Synopsis One sunny day, Robin Hood is walking through the forest in search of diversion when he notices a proud bishop with his company. Away from his men, Robin is frightened that the Bishop will hang him if he sees and catches him. He looks about and sees an old woman's house; he approaches and appeals to her for aid. Because he has previously given her a gift of both shoes and socks, she willingly agrees to help him hide from the Bishop and his men by exchanging her grey coat, spindle, and twine for his green mantle and arrows. Then Robin sets out to find his men; Little John sees him from a distance, thinks he is a witch, and is about to let fly an arrow at him, but Robin quickly reveals his identity. Meanwhile, the Bishop has gone to the old woman's house, and catches her there, believing her to be Robin; they ride away through the forest on horseback. But up ahead they sight a hundred bow-men gathered under a great green-wood tree, and, to the Bishop's shock and dismay, the old woman identifies them as Robin Hood and his men and herself as an old woman. Before the Bishop can flee, Robin calls him to stay, grabs his horse by the reins, and ties it to a tree. He then empties the Bishop's five hundred pounds into his mantle and is about to let him go when Little John demands that the Bishop say Mass for them. Robin and his men tie the Bishop to a tree, force him to say Mass, and then set him back on his horse with the sarcastic command that he pray for Robin.This synopsis refers to a text transcription of a seventeenth-century broadside ballad version of this tale in the Pepys collection held at Magdalene College of the University of Cambridge. Historical and cultural significance This ballad is part of a group of ballads about Robin Hood that in turn, like many of the popular ballads collected by Francis James Child, were in their time considered a threat to the Protestant religion. Puritan writers, like Edward Dering writing in 1572, considered such tales \\"'childish follye'\\" and \\"'witless devices.'\\", quoting Edward Dering, A brief and necessary instruction (1572), sig.A2v. Writing of the Robin Hood ballads after A Gest of Robyn Hode, their Victorian collector Francis Child claimed that variations on the \\"'Robin met with his match'\\" theme, such as this ballad, are \\"sometimes wearisome, sometimes sickening,\\" and that \\"a considerable part of the Robin Hood poetry looks like char-work done for the petty press, and should be judged as such.\\" Child had also called the Roxburghe and Pepys collections (in which some of these ballads are included) \\"'veritable dung-hills [...], in which only after a great deal of sickening grubbing, one finds a very moderate jewel.'\\"; Brown's italics However, as folklorist and ethnomusicologist Mary Ellen Brown has pointed out, Child's denigration of the later Robin Hood ballads is evidence of an ideological view he shared with many other scholars of his time who wanted to exclude cheap printed ballads such as these from their pedigree of the oral tradition and early literature. Child and others were reluctant to include such broadsides in their collections because they thought they \\"regularized the text, rather than reflecting and/or participating in tradition, which fostered multiformity.\\" On the other hand, the broadsides are significant in themselves as showing, as English jurist and legal scholar John Selden (1584‚Äì1654) puts it, \\"'how the wind sits. As take a straw and throw it up in the air; you shall see by that which way the wind is, which you shall not do by casting up a stone. More solid things do not show the complexion of the times so well as ballads and libels.'\\" Even though the broadsides are cultural ephemera, unlike weightier tomes, they are important because they are markers of contemporary \\"current events and popular trends.\\" It has been speculated that in his time Robin Hood represented a figure of peasant revolt, but the English medieval historian J. C. Holt has argued that the tales developed among the gentry, that he is a yeoman rather than a peasant, and that the tales do not mention peasants' complaints, such as oppressive taxes. Moreover, he does not seem to rebel against societal standards but to uphold them by being munificent, devout, and affable. Other scholars have seen the literature around Robin Hood as reflecting the interests of the common people against feudalism. The latter interpretation supports Selden's view that popular ballads provide a valuable window onto the thoughts and feelings of the common people on topical matters: for the peasantry, Robin Hood may have been a redemptive figure. Library/archival holdings The English Broadside Ballad Archive at the University of California, Santa Barbara holds four seventeenth-century broadside ballad versions of this tale: one in the Euing collection at the Glasgow University Library (303), two in the Pepys collection at Magdalene College at the University of Cambridge (2.109 and 2.122), and one in the Roxburghe ballad collection at the British Library (1.362-363).

Chick Henderson was born Henderson Rowntree in Hartlepool, England. He attended Galleys Field School on Hartlepool Headland. \\"Chick\\" was nothing more than his mother's nickname for her smallest son. His first recordings were made for Harry Leader in June 1935. The following year he began singing for Joe Loss' popular radio orchestra. He stayed with Loss for five years and became a great favorite among young women who formed his core audience. A tall, handsome man with a rich, strong vocal delivery, he appeared on postcards and magazine covers. In his short life, Chick Henderson made over 250 recordings but, as with many big band singers, his name did not appear on the record label--only the orchestra was listed. In July 1939, he recorded with Joe Loss' orchestra what would become his biggest-selling recording \\"Begin the Beguine\\", which sold over a million copies, the only recording by a 1930s vocalist to achieve such a triumph. Chick Henderson's five-year singing career came to an end with his final recordings in 1940. Less than a year following the start of World War II in September 1939, he began serving in the Merchant Navy. He survived two torpedo attacks on his ships, but after four years of service, sustained fatal wounds in Southsea from flying bomb shrapnel. Chick Henderson was 31 years old. A Sub-Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, on strength of HMS Victory at time of his death, he was buried in Haslar Royal Naval Cemetery under his real name. CWGC Casualty Record.

Education  The land to build the first school for Bellevue School District 51 was deeded by Thomas Morris in 1872. The first Bellevue schoolhouse was one-roomed, built around the time the land was deeded. This schoolhouse was in use until a new two-room school was built in 1917. After 1939, Bellevue began transporting seventh and eighth grade students to McMinnville School District 40. In 1942, all students began to be sent to Sheridan School District 48, before, in 1948, all students were sent to District 40. In 1950, Bellevue eventually consolidated with District 40.

It was previously a town that became a district in 1995. It is also the homeland of India's famous freedom fighter Bhagat Singh.  History  Nawanshahr was founded by migrants from Rahon, a city located near the Sutlej River, which puts it at risk of flooding. They named it Nawanshahar (meaning \\"‡®®‡©Ä‡®µ‡®æ‡®Ç ‡®∏‡®º‡®π‡®ø‡®∞\\" \\"Downtown\\"). Nawanshahr has been the stronghold of the Ghorewaha was allied to King Akbar via kinship ties.

Lala Paramanand was given a mould of large brick design by Queen Elizabeth in the presence of Maharaja Patiala in his courtroom, as a token of gratitude, to settle brick factories (Batha) in the city. Lala Paramanand first planned the construction of Mandi (now known as old Dana Mandi) in around 1920 which even has his name \\"PN\\" on bricks and his name on the Foundation Stone at old Dana Mandi Gate.

People of this district are economically sound.citation required Large numbers of families from the district have settled abroad. Consequently, huge remittance is received back in India which contributes to the district's economic development and prosperity. The prosperity of the Doaba area has grown considerably due to high land prices in the area, which is higher than that of most other districts in the state except for Ludhiana and Chandigarh. The economy of Nawanshahr is also improving due to the currency coming from overseas Punjabi people. Nawanshahr also has a railroad connecting it with Jalandhar, Rahon, and Jaijon.

The announcement was made by Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal to mark Bhagat Singh's 101st birth anniversary. As a result, Nawanshahr district was renamed Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar. There have been many families who played a big role in the development of Nawanshahr in the past. In the late 1800s and the early 1900s, the Behki family (formerly known as Abroll) left Nawanshahr in search of a better future. Notable freedom fighter Shaheed Bhagat Singh belongs from this region.

Two of the three victims of the attack were immigrant laborers, who also made up a large portion of the 40 injured. In January 2003, 23 people‚Äî15 Israelis and 8 foreign nationals‚Äîwere killed, and 120 wounded when two Palestinian suicide bombers blew themselves up on the pedestrian mall adjacent to the old central bus station. The mall was packed with shoppers and laborers returning home from work. In April 2006, during the Passover holiday, a Hamas suicide bomber blew himself up at the Rosh Ha'ir shwarma restaurant in Neve Sha'anan, killing 11 people and wounding 50. =Levinsky Garden Library= Located in Levinsky Park, the Garden Library consists of two open-air bookshelves (one for adults and one for children). The library services the whole community, but was originally designed with the refugee and migrant population of the Neve Sha'anan neighborhood in mind. The library was established in 2009 by the non-governmental organization ARTEAM. In addition to the free books, the library space also offers after school programs for children, artistic classes and workshops, and language lessons The library offers approximately 3,500 books in 16 different languages. It is located at 98 Lewinsky St. (corner of Lewinsky & Har Zion). The bookshelves are illuminated for easier browsing at night.

(1838‚Äì1910) was an American pioneer, newspaper editor, and historian. Scott is best remembered as the long-time editorialist of The Oregonian newspaper and was regarded by his contemporaries as instrumental in bringing the state of Oregon firmly into the political camp of the Republican Party. Early years and education Scott was born February 1, 1838, in rural Tazewell County, Illinois, near the town of Peoria, the son of John Tucker Scott, a farmer. The family crossed the Rocky Mountains as pioneers to Oregon in 1852. During the trip, his mother, Ann Roelofson Scott, died. His eight siblings included sisters Abigail and Catherine. The family settled in Yamhill County, where they remained one year before relocating north to Mason County on Puget Sound in the Washington Territory.Portrait and Biographical Record of Western Oregon: Containing Original Sketches of Many Well Known Citizens of the Past and Present. Chicago, IL: Chapman Publishing Co., 1904; pp. 71-73. Harvey Scott in 1857. In 1855 and 1856, Scott fought for a year as a volunteer in the Puget Sound War, serving with the local militia in skirmishes against the Nisqually, Muckleshoot, Puyallup, and Klickitat peoples.Edward L. Polich, A History of Portland's Secondary School System with Emphasis on the Superintendents and the Curriculum. PhD dissertation. University of Portland, 1950; pp. 35‚Äì36, 39. With the so-called Indian War at an end, in 1857, Scott walked 150 miles from the family home on Puget Sound to Forest Grove, Oregon, where he attended high school for four months. During this interval, Scott's parents moved their own home from the Washington Territory back to Oregon, establishing for themselves a new farm about 20 miles south of Oregon City. The family moved again in 1859, establishing a saw mill at Forest Grove. Harvey Scott spent the years from 1859 to 1863 splitting his time between farm work and mill work and education, working his way through school. He entered the fledgling Pacific University at Forest Grove and in 1863 became the first alumnus of that institution, head of a graduating class consisting only of himself.John B. Horner, Oregon: Her History, Her Great Men, Her Literature. Corvallis, OR: Gazette-Times, 1919; pg. 160. Career Statue of Harvey W. Scott by Gutzon Borglum at Mount Tabor Park, 1933 After graduation from school, Scott spent a year in Idaho as a gold miner. This interlude proved brief, however, and in 1864 he returned to Oregon, studying law in the office of attorney E.D. Shattuck, a leading Republican and Unionist during the ongoing American Civil War. Scott supported himself while reading law by working as the librarian of the Library Association of Portland. In 1865, Scott's plans to become an attorney came to an abrupt end when he was offered and accepted a position as editorial writer for the Portland Morning Oregonian. =Newspaper editor= Scott was editor of The Oregonian newspaper from 1866‚Äì1872. His editorials strongly supported the Union and the newly emerging Republican party during the Civil War. According to many sources, he was highly respected throughout his career, and did much to establish the field of journalism in Oregon; but Alfred Powers wrote in 1936 that Scott was \\"lacking in sympathy and humanity\\" and that he \\"held to outworn social theories,\\" and that his scholarship and character were overestimated. =Later career= Harvey W. Scott as he appeared near the end of his life. After leaving the paper in 1872, Scott was the collector of customs for the Port of Portland until 1877. He then bought a sizable amount of stock in The Oregonian and returned as its editor-in-chief. Around 1880, he vociferously opposed public high schools in Oregon, especially Portland, stating \\"the machinery of the schools has grown too cumbrous and expensive a system; that there are too many studies; that the high school is not a proper part of the system of public education;... that those who desire for their children an education beyond the common branches of the old-fashioned common school should pay for it.\\" Scott was a Scottish Rite Freemason.Eugene E. Snyder, Portland Potpourri. Portland, OR: Binford & Mort, 1991; pp. 73‚Äì79. =Historian= Scott also edited the first history of Portland, Oregon, published in 1890, and compiled the six-volume History of the Oregon Country with his son, Leslie M. Scott, who published it after Harvey's death. Death and legacy Scott died unexpectedly following surgery in Baltimore, Maryland, on August 7, 1910. His body was buried at River View Cemetery in Portland.River View Cemetery His wife, Margaret Scott, died in 1925. Mount Scott, an extinct volcano in Happy Valley, was named after him, as was Harvey Scott Elementary School in Northeast Portland. Using $10,000 left in his widow's will for the purpose, Gutzon Borglum (notable for sculptures on Mount Rushmore) was commissioned to erect a statue of Harvey W. Scott. The city council chose the summit of Mount Tabor for the statue in 1928 and Borglum placed a model of the statue there in 1930. The bronze statue was dedicated on July 22, 1933, with approximately 3000 in attendance, 23 years after Scott died. Oregon governor Julius Meier was chairman of the event and Chester Harvey Rowell gave a speech. The statue was toppled during the early morning hours of October 20, 2020.

The busway consists of two-way lanes running between Constellation Station and Akoranga Station, and from Akoranga Station a southbound-only lane that joins the harbour bridge approaches just south of the Onewa Road on-ramp system. Six stations provide access points for passengers to board; some stations have park and ride parking spaces; others have drop off and pick up zones only. City-bound Northern Express (NX1 and NX2) services commence from Hibiscus Coast Station or Albany Station and travel on local roads to Constellation Station, from where they travel on the dedicated busway lanes; from Albany, the lanes reduced travel time to Britomart Transport Centre from around one hour by car during peak hours to about half an hour by bus.Rail electrification ‚Äì Region Wide, Auckland Regional Council newsletter, June 2007, Page 3 In the reverse direction, NX1 and NX2 services leaving the city travel north to the Akoranga off-ramp, cross over the motorway, and enter Akoranga Station, from where they travel north on the busway lanes. The busway lanes are also an important transport link within the North Shore, where they are the spine of the bus-based public transport system. History =Background= Prior to 2000, indicative scheme and station planning was undertaken by International Transport Planning Consultants (McCormack Rankine International) who were engaged by Serco on behalf of Transit. In 2000, the North Shore Busway Office was established with a team to focus both on the overall scheme as well as the station components. This reflected the nature of the proposed funding. McCormack Rankine undertook refined schematic design and the Busway Team focused on the community consultation and funding programmes. The ARC held a regional Station Theming Design Competition in 2001 to select a consultant to develop a Theming Manual for application across all major public transport stations to the Auckland Region. This provided a distinctive design signature to the region visually linking all public transport facilities. MARIO MADAYAG/Jasmax Architects were selected as winners for the competition with part of their benefit being their commission on this concept design exercise. The ARC separately engaged MARIO MADAYAG/Jasmax to develop the Theming Manuals within the set parameters of that project. The project ran in parallel with the Busway Station Concept design exercise but was heavily integrated as the pedestrian overbridge, stair lift towers and waiting enclosure developed concepts for the Busway were integrated with the Theming Manual.https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/AK0110/S00019/transport-network-design- winners-announced.htm?from-mobile=bottom- link-01https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/plans-projects-policies-reports- bylaws/our-plans-strategies/auckland-plan/transport-access/Pages/the-northern- busway.aspxNorth Shore Busway Station Concept Design Brief Prepared by BRT Project Team 24 April 2002 File G72 Concept Design =Concept, design and construction= Maxx-branded Northern Express service operated by Ritchies Transport in 2008 Smales Farm Station, shortly before the busway opening Concept design for the busway was developed by MRCagney (formerly McCormick Rankin Cagney), with detailed design and consultation completed by Mario Madayag Architecture, Jasmax, Beca Group, Opus and Connell Wagner. Fletcher Construction was responsible for construction. Akoranga, Smales Farm, and Sunnynook stations were built by NZ Strong Construction.North Shore Busways (from the NZ Strong Construction company website. Accessed 3 March 2008.) Difficulties encountered included the nearby residential areas, the predominantly soft ground, and environmental efforts to protect New Zealand dotterel breeding grounds. Construction employed around 300 people at its peak, with around a million man-hours being invested, including shifts during 512 nights.Busway bits 'n' pieces ‚Äì Region Wide, newsletter of the Auckland Regional Council, March 2008, Page 4 =Operation= The busway was officially opened in February 2008 after several years of construction, though the Albany and Constellation stations had been operating since December 2005 using the normal Northern Motorway lanes.Northern Busway ‚Äì The New Zealand Herald, Saturday 30 June 2007, Page C6 It was credited with reducing peak traffic on the Northern Motorway by around 500 cars each rush hour one month after opening,Busway reduces cars by 500 each rush hour ‚Äì Region Wide, newsletter of the Auckland Regional Council, March 2008, Page 4 and about 39% of passengers on the Northern Express bus service had never used public transport before. The busway was initially used by 70 buses per hour during peak time. In 2008, the busway received the 'Shell Bitumen Excellence Award for a Major Roading Project' and the 'Roading New Zealand Supreme Award'. In June 2009, it received the Ingenium 'Excellence Award' (in the category for projects above NZ$2 million construction cost). In June 2010, the busway carried its 5 millionth passenger and was estimated to remove the equivalent of about 5,100 cars in the morning peak, with 80 buses per hour during peak times. By mid-2011, frequency of the Northern Express had risen to every three minutes during the morning peak hour, five minutes during the 'shoulder peak'. In 2015, some Northern Express services were extended to Hibiscus Coast Busway Station (formerly named Silverdale Park and Ride). In 2017, Auckland Transport's projections indicated that the busway would reach maximum capacity in 2026, twenty years earlier than originally expected. AT's report said that increased patronage would \\"manifest in overcapacity conditions and poor operational performances\\" at Albany, Sunnynook and Akoranga stations. AT was investigating a range of improvements, including lengthening station platforms. A decision on a timeline for conversion of the busway to a rail link was expected to be announced before the end of 2017. In the 12 months to December 2018, the busway carried nearly 6 million passengers.https://www.greaterauckland.org.nz/2018/11/30/oct-18-ridership/ =Funding= The busway became fully operational in 2009, with some final sections being completed with little publicity, for around NZ$290‚Äì294 million: $210 million for the busway and $84 million for the stations.Following the money ‚Äì e.nz magazine, IPENZ January/February 2007 The project was funded by Transit New Zealand, ARTA, Auckland City Council and North Shore City Council.

Accessed 21 March 2008.) =Other structures= Major related structures are the new Esmonde Interchange (including large-scale improvements for general traffic) and Tristram Avenue Viaduct, which crosses the often-congested Tristram Avenue via grade separation. The viaduct has 12 spans of 30 m each, with the foundation piles being 1.5 m thick. =Electricity transmission cables= Cable ducts were placed beneath the busway during the construction in 2005, to provide for the future installation of electricity transmission cables. The cables installed in these ducts during 2012 and 2013 form part of a major upgrade to the security of supply to North Auckland and Northland. Plans Sunnynook, the smallest of the six stations. The dedicated busway lanes will be extended northwards from Constellation Station to Albany Station. An extension towards Orewa in the north is being debated for the long-term future. It was originally expected to cost around NZ$500 million, although the success of the scheme has now sparked potentially more extensive schemes for between NZ$700 million and NZ$1.2 billion to at least Silverdale, with up to five tunnels and seven bridges, including a motorway flyover between Constellation and Albany stations. Plans in 2008 included additional stations at Rosedale and Redvale. In December 2017, plans were released for a $70 million station at Rosedale, situated between the Albany and Constellation stations. The station would be sited on Arrenway Drive with platforms extending across Rosedale Road for bus transfers to other routes. A construction start date of mid-2019 and opening in 2021 were proposed. =Conversion to rail-based transit= The Northern Busway's usage is tracking towards capacity being reached by 2030. Auckland Transport have studied the future mass transit needs for the North Shore, with light rail being determined the most flexible mode compared to other rail-based options. This may use a tunnel to access Auckland city centre as part of the proposed second Auckland Harbour crossing.

The school's students attend classes at night on a part-time basis.  History  In the fall of 1911, Morton B. Adams, William P. Cooper, Lee Douglas, and Robert Selph Henry, then recent graduates of Vanderbilt University Law School, opened night law classes at YMCA for the benefit of those unable to attend law classes during the day. The law school has been in continual operation since that time. It was incorporated under the laws of the State of Tennessee on January 19, 1927. Since that date, the law school has conferred the Juris Doctor or Doctor of Jurisprudence degree on over 2,970 graduates. Until November, 1986, the school operated as the Nashville YMCA Night Law School, leasing its classroom space from the Downtown YMCA. On November 24, 1986, the school officially changed its name to Nashville School of Law. James Gilbert Lackey, Jr. (1915‚Äì1987) served as dean of the Law School and taught Contracts from 1946 to 1986. Upon his retirement, the faculty elected Judge Joe C. Loser, Jr., dean of the school. Judge Loser then retired from the Third Circuit Court of Davidson County, Tennessee after 20 years on the bench to become the fourth dean in the school's history on August 23, 1986. Following Loser's retirement, former Tennessee Supreme Court Justice and NSL faculty member, Justice William C. Koch, Jr. became the fifth dean of NSL in July 2014.  Accreditation  Nashville School of Law is approved by the Tennessee Board of Law Examiners and graduates may take the bar examination and practice law in the State of Tennessee. The School is not, however, accredited by the American Bar Association. This limits the ability of graduates to practice law in states other than Tennessee. Graduates of NSL are not eligible to take the bar or practice law in 19 states, and may only take the bar or practice in a further 23 states if they have passed another state's bar exam.  Academics  The 57 credit hours required for the J.D. degree require four years to complete, and several of the courses are designed to focus on practice in Tennessee. Classes are held each evening Monday to Thursday. Classes begin in August each fall and continue through early May. Classes are on Monday and Thursday nights first and second year, typically beginning at 6:30 p.m. and running until 10 p.m. Third- and fourth-year students add some classes on Wednesday nights. All students must complete 57 credit hours with a GPA of at least 2.25 to graduate. The top ten percent of each graduating class is inducted into Cooper's Inn, the school honor society, and recognized at graduation. The student who graduates at the top of the class is awarded the Founder's Award and receives a set of the Tennessee Code Annotated. = Faculty = The school's faculty includes practicing lawyers and judges from across the state of Tennessee; formerly including the late former Tennessee Chief Justice Adolpho Birch, and now including former Justice William C. Koch, Jr. of the Tennessee Supreme Court, who became dean of the school in July 2014.  Campus and library  In the Fall of 2005, the school moved into its current facility at 4013 Armory Oaks Drive. It had been nearby at 2934 Sidco Drive, since 1990. The Nashville School of Law Library consists of 15,727 hard copy volumes. All students have access to LexisNexis and Westlaw research services in the library at the computer lab, from any location in the facility through a wireless-enabled laptop, and from any other location with Internet access.  Admissions  The Nashville School of Law Nashville School of Law enters two terms each year, in February and August, and operates on a \\"rolling admissions\\" basis. Applications are processed at the time they are received. Applicants must have received, or will receive prior to matriculation, a bachelor's degree from a college or university on the approved list of the Southern Association of Schools and Colleges, or the equivalent regional accrediting association. The applicant must also submit three letters of recommendation, one of which must be from someone in the legal field, and should describe any extracurricular activities during their undergraduate career or business accomplishments since college graduation. Applicants must also include an explanation of any prior arrests and/or any disciplinary action received from an educational institution. Nashville School of Law maintains a strict anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policy, and provides assistance for disabled students. The median LSAT score for students admitted in the 2018‚Äì2019 admissions cycle was 148 and the median GPA was 3.19.  Costs and financial aid  For the 2019‚Äì20 school year, tuition is $7,420 (excluding books) for a typical first-year load of twelve credit hours. The total cost of the 57 credit hours needed to graduate is $35,890 (excluding books). As a private institution, NSL does not participate in federal loan programs; students are not eligible for federal loans and must apply independently for loans through banks. The school offers a limited number of partial and full scholarships for students, based on need and merit.  Bar passage rate and post-graduation employment  Nashville School of Law does not publish employment data for its recent graduates. Of the 54 Nashville School of Law graduates who took the Tennessee bar exam for the first time in July 2019, 37 (68.5%) passed, vs. an 80.0% pass rate for the state as a whole.

More than 20,000 people attended. Detroit was chosen in part because of its activism in community building resulting from the lack of support from the Federal government of the United States. Organizers hoped that half of the 15,000 participants they had predicted would be from the Midwest. Organizers planned on supporting and beautifying the neighborhood. Thousands of bicycles used during the forum were to be donated to the residents afterward. Some attendees bought vacant homes that were donated to a local organization after the Forum. The Detroit Liberation Library was created from hundreds of books collected from USSF participants from all over the country and later offered throughout the city.http://amakisi.wix.com/dgcac#!detroitliberationlibrary/czmx Supporters of the Forum were encouraged to create Peoples Movement Assemblies in their own communities. Activists at the gathering participated in more than 1,000 self- organized workshops. One of the most well attended events was a conversation between Grace Lee Boggs and Immanuel Wallerstein. Thousands of Social Forum participants marched to occupy Chase Bank Detroit headquarters, resulting in a national Chase Bank official speaking with church leaders in Detroit about foreclosures. Progressive religious groups played a larger role in the 2010 US Social Forum than at the 2007 event. =People's Movement Assemblies= People's Movement Assemblies (PMA's) are informally organized groups of activists to coordinate and come up with solutions to various social problems.

Bob Weber Jr. is the son of Bob Weber Sr., creator of the comic strip Moose & Molly. As the comic's name implies, the target audience is young children. According to the official website, Slylock Fox & Comics For Kids appears in nearly 400 newspapers with a combined readership of over 30 million. Overview Slylock Fox regularly features a logic puzzle presented in a single panel. Slylock, an anthropomorphic fox detective, is constantly matching wits against a variety of criminals, including Count Weirdly, Shady Shrew and Slick Smitty. The strip does not normally use dialogue; instead, text accompanying the illustration informs the reader of a problem Slylock must solve. These often include escaping from a dungeon, locating stolen goods, or determining who committed a crime through visual clues or logical inconsistencies. The puzzle solution is printed upside down. Slylock is assisted by sidekick Max Mouse. Max wears pink shorts and a matching bowler hat. He functions as Slylock's foil, being distracted at the crime scene or coming to a false conclusion, only to be corrected by Slylock. A varied cast of witnesses, victims, policemen and criminals fill in the rest of Slylock's world. These characters' names usually contain either some form of alliteration, a type of animal, a profession, or a personality trait. This allows Weber to quickly establish a scene and set up a mystery using very little space. Some notable examples include Deputy Duck, Roxy Rabbit, and Shady Shrew. Most of these characters are seen once and/or never again. Slylock's name is likely an homage to the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. Like Sherlock, Slylock is traditionally depicted with a magnifying glass and a blue deerstalker hat; also, he wears a blue suit and cape. The Slylock Fox logic puzzles appear only in Sunday and Monday strips. The Tuesday to Saturday strips consist of spot the difference puzzles, trivia challenges, how-to-draw tutorials, and other activities. The Sunday edition features both Slylock and the activities. Slylock Fox had an iPhone game called \\"Slylock Fox Spot the Differences\\". The iPhone app provides children of all ages the ability to test their observation skills with fifty of Bob Weber Jr.'s favorite spot the differences puzzles. Media The now-defunct Slylock Fox & Comics For Kids website featured many additional Slylock mysteries that have never been printed, in addition to other activities. The site was voted an \\"Educational Best Bet\\" by USA Today and received an award for \\"Best of the Net\\" from About.com in April 1999.Snapshot of official site via Internet Archive The site currently redirects to the official page for Weber's other comic strip, Oh, Brother!.

Noahidism () or Noachidism () is a monotheistic, Jewish religious movement based upon the Seven Laws of Noah and their traditional interpretations within Orthodox Judaism. According to the Jewish law, non-Jews (Gentiles) are not obligated to convert to Judaism, but they are required to observe the Seven Laws of Noah to be assured of a place in the World to Come (Olam Ha-Ba), the final reward of the righteous.Encyclopedia Talmudit (Hebrew ed., Israel, 5741/1981, entry Ben Noah, end of article); note the variant reading of Maimonides and the references in the footnote. The divinely ordained penalty for violating any of these Noahide Laws is discussed in the Talmud, but in practical terms it is subject to the working legal system which is established by the society at large. Those who subscribe to the observance of the Noahic Covenant are referred to as Bnei Noach (, \\"Children of Noah\\") or Noahides (). The modern Noahide movement was founded in the 1990s by Orthodox rabbis from Israel, mainly tied to Chabad-Lubavitch and religious Zionist organizations, including The Temple Institute. Historically, the Hebrew term Bnei Noach has been applied to all non-Jews as descendants of Noah. However, nowadays it is primarily used to refer specifically to those \\"Righteous Gentiles\\" who observe the Seven Laws of Noah. According to a Noahide source in 2018, there are over 20,000 official Noahides, and the country with the greatest number is the Philippines. The Seven Laws of Noah The seven laws listed by the Babylonian Talmud in Sanhedrin 56a are: # Do not worship idols. # Do not blaspheme God. # Do not murder. # Do not practice sexual immorality. # Do not steal. # Do not eat flesh from a living animal. # Establish Courts of Justice to build upon these laws. Historical movements The Sebomenoi or God- fearers are an early example of non-Jews being included within the Jewish community. Modern Noahidism There are two different concepts of Noahidism in Judaism: 1. The B'nei Noah movement whose members observe the Seven Commandments or Laws only and hold that the remaining commandments do not apply to them. This is the view of Chabad-Lubavitch and a few other movements. This means that Noahides may not observe the Sabbath, study Torah (except for the Seven Laws), etc. 2. The B'nei Noah movement whose members hold that they can adhere completely to Judaism in order to learn from the Jews and together promote the World to Come (Olam Ha-Ba) but without becoming a part of the Jewish people (i.e. without performing a giyur). After B'nei Noah accept the obligatory seven commandments, they can, if they so desire, carry out the rest of the Jewish commandments, including studying the Torah, observing the Sabbath, celebrating Jewish holidays, etc. This view is held, for example, by Yoel Schwartz and Oury Amos Cherki. According to the first approach, the answer to the question \\"Can a non-Jew observe the Sabbath and study the Torah?\\" is negative, and according to the second one, it is affirmative. During the Golden Age of Jewish culture in the Iberian Peninsula, the medieval Jewish philosopher and rabbi Maimonides (1135‚Äì1204) wrote in the halakhic legal code Mishneh Torah that Gentiles (non- Jews) must perform exclusively the Seven Laws of Noah and refrain from studying the Torah or performing any Jewish commandment, including resting on the Shabbat; however, Maimonides also states that if Gentiles want to perform any Jewish commandment besides the Seven Laws of Noah according to the correct halakhic procedure, they are not prevented from doing so. Cherki explains this apparent contradiction in Maimonides by saying that the goy and B'nei Noah are different halakhic concepts. A goy is a gentile who has not yet accepted the commandments of B'nei Noah. However, if he has already accepted Seven Laws, he ceases to be a goy and became a B'nei Noah, and as such can follow additional commandments, including keeping the Sabbath and teaching the Torah. =High Council of B‚Äônei Noah= A High Council of B‚Äônei Noah, set up to represent B'nei Noah communities around the world, was endorsed by a group that claimed to be the new Sanhedrin. Acknowledgment Meir Kahane and Shlomo Carlebach organized one of the first Noahide conferences in the 1980s. In 1990, Kahane was the keynote speaker at the First International Conference of the Descendants of Noah in Fort Worth, Texas. The Chabad-Lubavitch movement has been the most active in Noahide outreach, believing that there is spiritual and societal value for non-Jews in at least simply acknowledging the Noahide laws, and even more so if they accept or observe them. In 1991, they had a reference to these laws enshrined in a Congressional proclamation: Presidential Proclamation 5956, signed by then-President George H. W. Bush. Recalling Joint House Resolution 173, and recalling that the ethical and moral principles of all civilizations come in part from the Seven Noahide Laws, it proclaimed March 26, 1991, as \\"Education Day, USA\\". Subsequently, Public Law 102-14 formally designated the Lubavitcher Rebbe's 90th birthday as \\"Education Day, USA,\\" with Congress recalling that \\"without these ethical values and principles, the edifice of civilization stands in serious peril of returning to chaos,\\" and that \\"society is profoundly concerned with the recent weakening of these principles, that has resulted in crises that beleaguer and threaten the fabric of civilized society.\\" In April 2006, the spiritual leader of the Druze community in Israel, Sheikh Mowafak Tarif, met with a representative of Chabad-Lubavitch to sign a declaration calling on all non-Jews in Israel to observe the Noahide laws. The mayor of the Galilean city of Shefa-'Amr (Shfaram) ‚Äî where Muslim, Christian, and Druze communities live side-by-side ‚Äî also signed the document. In March 2007, Chabad-Lubavitch gathered ambassadors from six countries to take part in a gathering to declare their support of the Noahide laws. They represented Poland, Latvia, Mexico, Panama, Ghana, and Japan. They were part of a special program organized by Harav Boaz Kali. In April, Abu Gosh mayor Salim Jaber accepted the seven Noahide laws as part of a mass rally by Chabad at the Bloomfield Stadium in Tel Aviv. In May, the newly elected president of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, met with a Chabad-Lubavitch rabbi, Dovid Zaoui, who presented him with the literature on the Noahide laws. In 2016, the Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel, Yitzhak Yosef, declared during a sermon that Jewish law requires that the only non-Jews allowed to live in Israel are obligated to follow the Noahide laws: ‚ÄúAccording to Jewish law, it‚Äôs forbidden for a non-Jew to live in the Land of Israel ‚Äì unless he has accepted the seven Noahide laws, [...] If the non-Jew is unwilling to accept these laws, then we can send him to Saudi Arabia, [...] When there will be full, true redemption, we will do this.‚Äù Yosef further added: \\"non-Jews shouldn‚Äôt live in the land of Israel. [...] If our hand were firm, if we had the power to rule, then non-Jews must not live in Israel. But, our hand is not firm. [...] Who, otherwise be the servants? Who will be our helpers? This is why we leave them in Israel.\\" Yosef‚Äôs sermon sparked outrage in Israel and was fiercely criticized by several human rights associations, NGOs and members of the Knesset; Jonathan Greenblatt, Anti-Defamation League's CEO and national director, and Carole Nuriel, Anti-Defamation League‚Äôs Israel Office acting director, issued a strong denunciation of Yosef‚Äôs sermon: See also * Ger toshav * Haredi Judaism * Hasidic Judaism * Judaizers * Modern Orthodox Judaism * Proselyte * Righteous among the Nations * Seven Laws of Noah * Shituf * Sons of Noah * Subbotniks References External links * Category:Chabad-Lubavitch (Hasidic dynasty) Category:Jewish religious movements Category:New religious movements Category:Orthodox Judaism Category:Religious Zionism he:◊ó◊°◊ô◊ì ◊ê◊ï◊û◊ï◊™ ◊î◊¢◊ï◊ú◊ù (◊î◊ú◊õ◊î) ","title":"Noahidism"},{"id":"5631982","text":"Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I (also called The Lady in Gold or The Woman in Gold) is a painting by Gustav Klimt, completed between 1903 and 1907. The portrait was commissioned by the sitter's husband, , a Jewish banker and sugar producer. The painting was stolen by the Nazis in 1941 and displayed at the √ñsterreichische Galerie Belvedere. The portrait is the final and most fully representative work of Klimt's golden phase. It was the first of two depictions of Adele by Klimt‚Äîthe second was completed in 1912; these were two of several works by the artist that the family owned. Adele died in 1925; her will asked that the artworks by Klimt were to be left to the Galerie Belvedere, although these belonged to Ferdinand, not her. Following the Anschluss of Austria by Nazi Germany, Ferdinand fled Vienna, and made his way to Switzerland, leaving behind much of his wealth, including his large art collection. The painting was stolen by the Nazis in 1941, along with the remainder of Ferdinand's assets, after a charge of tax evasion was made against him. The assets raised from the purported sales of artwork, property and his sugar business were offset against the tax claim. The lawyer acting on behalf of the German state gave the portrait to the Galerie Belvedere, claiming he was following the wishes Adele had made in her will. Ferdinand died in 1946; his will stated that his estate should go to his nephew and two nieces. In 1998 Hubertus Czernin, the Austrian investigative journalist, established that the Galerie Belvedere contained several works stolen from Jewish owners in the war, and that the gallery had refused to return the art to their original owners, or to acknowledge a theft had taken place. One of Ferdinand's nieces, Maria Altmann, hired the lawyer E. Randol Schoenberg to make a claim against the gallery for the return of five works by Klimt. After a seven-year legal claim, which included a hearing in front of the Supreme Court of the United States, an arbitration committee in Vienna agreed that the painting, and others, had been stolen from the family and that it should be returned to Altmann. She sold it the same year for $135 million, at the time a record price for a painting to the businessman and art collector Ronald Lauder, who placed the work in the Neue Galerie, the New York-based gallery he co-founded. Background =Gustav Klimt= Gustav Klimt in 1908 Gustav Klimt was born in 1862 in Baumgarten, near Vienna in Austria-Hungary. He attended the Vienna School of Arts and Crafts (German: Kunstgewerbeschule Wien) before taking on commissions with his brother, Ernst, and a fellow- student Franz von Matsch from 1879. Over the next decade, alongside several private commissions for portraiture, they painted interior murals and ceilings in large public buildings, including the , the and the ceiling of the Great Hall at the University of Vienna. Klimt worked in Vienna during the , during which time the city made \\"an extreme and lasting contribution to the history of modern art\\". During the 1890s he was influenced by European avant-garde art, including the works of the painters Fernand Khnopff, Jan Toorop and Aubrey Beardsley. In 1897 he was a founding member and president of the Vienna Secession, a group of artists who wanted to break with what they saw as the prevailing conservatism of the Viennese . Klimt in particular challenged what he saw as the \\"hypocritical boundaries of respectability set by Viennese society\\"; according to the art historian Susanna Partsch, he was \\"the of the Viennese art scene, [and] was acknowledged to be the painter of beautiful women\\". By 1900 he was the preferred portrait painter of the wives of the largely Jewish Viennese bourgeoisie, an emerging class of self-made industrialists who were \\"buying the innovative new art that state museums rejected\\", according to the journalist Anne-Marie O'Connor. From 1898 Klimt began to experiment with the style in what became known as his Byzantine or Golden period, when his works, stylistically influenced by Art Nouveau and the Arts and Crafts movement, were gilded with gold leaf. Klimt had begun using gold in his 1890 portrait of the pianist Joseph Pembauer, but his first work that included a golden theme was Pallas Athene (1898). The art historian Gilles N√©ret considers that the use of gold in the painting \\"underlines the essential erotic ingredient in ... [Klimt's] view of the world\\". N√©ret also states that Klimt used the gold to give subjects a sacred or magical quality. =Ferdinand and Adele Bloch-Bauer= was from a wealthy Jewish Viennese family. Her father was a director of the , the seventh largest bank in Austria-Hungary, and the general director of Oriental Railroads. In the late 1890s Adele met Klimt, and may have begun a relationship with him. Opinion is divided on whether Adele and Klimt had an affair. The artist Catherine Dean considered that Adele was \\"the only society lady painted by Klimt who is known definitely to be his mistress\\", while the journalist Melissa M√ºller and the academic Monica Tatzkow write that \\"no evidence has ever been produced that their relationship was more than a friendship\\". Whitford observes that some of the preliminary sketches that Klimt made for The Kiss showed a bearded figure which was possibly a self-portrait; the female partner is described by Whitford as an \\"idealised portrait of Adele\\". Whitford writes that the only evidence put forward to support the theory is the position of the woman's right hand, as Adele had a disfigured finger following a childhood accident. Adele's parents arranged a marriage with Ferdinand Bloch, a banker and sugar manufacturer; Adele's older sister had previously married Ferdinand's older brother. Ferdinand was older than his fianc√©e and at the time of the marriage in December 1899, she was 18 and he was 35. The couple, who had no children, both changed their surnames to Bloch-Bauer. Socially well-connected, Adele brought together writers, politicians and intellectuals for regular salons at their home. The couple shared a love of art, and patronised several artists, collecting primarily nineteenth-century Viennese paintings and modern sculpture. Ferdinand also had a passion for neoclassical porcelain, and by 1934 his collection was over 400 pieces and one of the finest in the world. In 1901 Klimt painted Judith and the Head of Holofernes; the art historian Gottfried Fliedl observes that the painting is \\"widely known and interpreted as Salome\\". Adele was the model for the work, and wore a heavily-jewelled deep choker given to her by Ferdinand, in what Whitford describes as \\"Klimt's most erotic painting\\". Whitford also writes that the painting displays \\"apparent evidence of ... cuckoldry\\". In 1903 Ferdinand purchased his first Klimt work from the artist, Buchenwald (Beech Forest). The painting =Preparation and execution= In mid-1903 Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer commissioned Klimt to paint a portrait of his wife; he wished to give the piece to Adele's parents as an anniversary present that October. Klimt drew over a hundred preparatory sketches for the portrait between 1903 and 1904. The Bloch-Bauers purchased some of the sketches he had made of Adele when they obtained 16 Klimt drawings. In December 1903, along with fellow artist Maximilian Lenz, Klimt visited the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna where he studied the early- Christian Byzantine gold mosaics of Justinian I and his wife, Empress Theodora. Lenz later wrote that \\"the mosaics made an immense decisive impression on ... [Klimt]. From this comes the resplendence, the stiff decoration of his art\\". Klimt later said that the \\"mosaics of unbelievable splendour\\" were a \\"revelation\\" to him. The Ravenna mosaics also attracted the attention of other artists who provided illustrations of the work, including Wassily Kandinsky in 1911 and Clive Bell in 1914. Klimt undertook more extensive preparations for the portrait than any other piece he worked on. Much of the portrait was undertaken by an elaborate technique of using gold and silver leaf and then adding decorative motifs in bas-relief using gesso, a paint mixture consisting of a binder mixed with chalk or gypsum. The frame for the painting, covered in gold leaf, was made by the architect Josef Hoffmann. Klimt finished the work by 1907. =Description= The decorative motifs: symbols suggestive of erotica The painting measures ; it is composed of oil paint and silver and gold leaf on canvas. The portrait shows Adele Bloch-Bauer sitting on a golden throne or chair, in front of a golden starry background. Around her neck is the same jewelled choker Klimt included in the Judith painting. She wears a tight golden dress in a triangular shape, made up of rectilinear forms. In places the dress merges into the background so much so that the museum curator Jan Thompson writes that \\"one comes across the model almost by accident, so enveloped is she in the thick geometric scheme\\". Peter Vergo, writing for Grove Art, considers that the painting \\"marks the height of ... [Klimt's] gold-encrusted manner of painting\\". Adele's hair, face, d√©colletage and hands are painted in oil; they make up less than a twelfth of the work and, in Whitford's opinion, convey little about the sitter's character. For Whitford the effect of the gold background is to \\"remove Adele Bloch-Bauer from the earthly plane, transform the flesh and blood into an apparition from a dream of sensuality and self-indulgence\\"; he, and Thomson, consider the work to look more like a religious icon than a secular portrait. O'Connor writes that the painting \\"seem[s] to embody femininity\\", and thus likens it to the Mona Lisa, while for M√ºller and Tatzkow, the gold gives the effect that Adele appears \\"melancholy and vulnerable, unapproachably aloof and yet rapt\\". Both the current holder of the portrait‚Äîthe Neue Galerie New York‚Äîand the art historian Elana Shapira describe how the background and gown contain symbols suggestive of erotica, including triangles, eggs, shapes of eyes and almonds. Also present are decorative motifs on the theme of the letters A and B, the sitter's initials. Whitford identifies influences of the art of the Byzantine, Egypt, Mycenae and Greece, describing that \\"the gold is like that in Byzantine mosaics; the eyes on the dress are Egyptian, the repeated coils and whorls Mycenaean, while other decorative devices, based on the initial letters of the sitter's name, are vaguely Greek\\". Reception Portrait of Fritza Riedler (1906), exhibited and criticised alongside the Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer in 1907 Klimt exhibited his portrait at the 1907 Mannheim International Art Show, alongside the Portrait of Fritza Riedler (1906). Many of the critics had negative reactions to the two paintings, describing them as \\"mosaic-like wall-grotesqueries\\", \\"bizarre\\", \\"absurdities\\" and \\"vulgarities\\". In 1908 the portrait was exhibited at the in Vienna where critical reaction was mixed. The unnamed reviewer from the Wiener Allgemeine Zeitung described the painting as \\"an idol in a golden shrine\\", while the critic Eduard P√∂tzl described the work as \\"\\" (\\"more brass than Bloch\\"). According to the art historian Tobias G. Natter, some critics disapproved of the loss of the sitter's individuality, while others \\"accused Klimt of endangering the autonomy of art\\". History and ownership =1912‚Äì1945= Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II, the 1912 painting by Klimt After exhibition at the , the portrait was hung at the Bloch-Bauers' Vienna residence. In 1912 Ferdinand commissioned a second painting of his wife, in which \\"the erotic charge of the likeness of 1907 has been spent\\", according to Whitford. In February 1918, Klimt suffered a stroke and was hospitalised; he caught pneumonia due to the worldwide influenza epidemic and died that month. On 19 January 1923 Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a will. Ferdinand's brother Gustav, a lawyer by training, helped her frame the document and was named as the executor. The will included a reference to the Klimt works owned by the couple, including the two portraits of her: > > (Translates from the German as: \\"I ask my husband after his death to leave > my two portraits and the four landscapes by Gustav Klimt to the Austrian > State Gallery in Vienna.\\") In February 1925 Adele died of meningitis. Shortly afterwards Gustav filed for probate; he included a document that stated that the clause in the will was precatory, i.e. a request rather than a binding testament. He added that Ferdinand had said he would honour the clause, even though he, not Adele, was the legal owner of the paintings. The works by Klimt which Ferdinand owned, including the two portraits, were moved to Adele's bedroom as a shrine to her. The painting was lent for an exhibition at the Vienna Secession in 1928 to mark the tenth anniversary of Klimt's death; in 1934 it was displayed in London as part of the Austria in London exhibition. In 1936 Ferdinand gave Schloss Kammer am Attersee III to the √ñsterreichische Galerie Belvedere; he later acquired a further Klimt painting, the Portrait of Amalie Zuckerkandl (1917‚Äì1918). In 1937 the golden portrait of Adele was lent for display at the Paris Exposition. Detail showing the jewelled choker given to Maria Altmann on her wedding day and stolen by the Nazis In December 1937 Gustav's daughter‚Äìand Ferdinand's niece‚ÄìMaria, married the young opera singer Fritz Altman. Ferdinand gave her Adele's jewelled choker as a wedding present. Ferdinand left Vienna for his Czechoslovakian castle in March 1938, following the Anschluss of Austria by Nazi Germany. That autumn, following the Munich Agreement, he realised he was not safe and left for Paris. In September the following year, he moved to neutral Switzerland where he lived in a hotel. In his absence the Nazi regime falsely accused him of evading taxes of 1.4 million Reichsmarks. His assets were frozen and, in May 1938, a seizure order was issued that allowed the state to dispose of his property as they felt fit. His sugar factory was confiscated and turned over to the state, and went through a process of Aryanisation as Jewish shareholders and managers were replaced. His Viennese residence became an office of , the German railway company, while his castle in Czechoslovakia was taken after the German occupation as the personal residence of the SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer Reinhard Heydrich. As part of the process to deal with the purported tax evasion, the Nazi lawyer Friedrich F√ºhrer was appointed as the administrator of the estate. In January 1939 he convened a meeting of museum and gallery directors to inspect the works and to give an indication of which they would like to obtain. After the collection was catalogued, Adolf Hitler used the ' decree to obtain part of the collection at a reduced price. Several other Nazi leaders, including Hermann G√∂ring, the Commander-in-Chief of the , also obtained works from the collection. G√∂ring also used the decree to obtain the jewelled choker that had been given to Maria Altmann; it was given as a gift to Emmy, his wife. Schloss Kammer am Attersee III (1910), which was swapped for the Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I In December 1941 F√ºhrer transferred the paintings Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I and Apfelbaum I to the Galerie Belvedere in return for Schloss Kammer am Attersee III, which he then sold to Gustav Ucicky, an illegitimate son of Klimt. A note accompanying the paintings stated he was acting in accordance with Adele's will. To remove all reference to its Jewish subject matter, the gallery renamed the portrait with the German title (translates as Lady in Gold). =1945‚Äìpresent= In August 1945 Ferdinand wrote a final will that revoked all previous ones. It made no reference to the pictures, which he thought had been lost forever, but it stated that his entire estate was left to his nephew and two nieces‚Äîone of whom was Maria Altmann. Ferdinand died in Switzerland in November that year. In 1946 the Austrian state issued an Annulment Act that declared all transactions motivated by Nazi discrimination were void; any Jews who wanted to remove artwork from Austria were forced to give some of their works to Austrian museums in order to obtain an export permit for others. The Bloch- Bauer family hired Dr Gustav Rinesh, a Viennese lawyer, to reclaim stolen artwork on their behalf. Using the records produced by F√ºhrer, he traced most of the works to the Galerie Belvedere, and H√§user in Unterach, to F√ºhrer's own private collection. Several works were returned to the Bloch-Bauer estate, but no Klimt paintings; to obtain the necessary export permits, the family were forced to let the Austrian state retain H√§user in Unterach am Attersee, Adele Bloch-Bauer I, Adele Bloch-Bauer II, and Apfelbaum I. They were also forced to relinquish any claims on Buchenwald and Schloss Kammer am Attersee III. The Galerie Belvedere based its claim of retention of the Klimt works on Adele's will. In 1998 the Austrian government introduced the Art Restitution Act, which looked again at the question of art stolen by the Nazis. The government formed a restitution committee to report on which works should be returned; government archives were opened up to research into the provenance of works held by the government. Hubertus Czernin, the Austrian investigative journalist, undertook extensive research in the newly opened archives and published a story about the theft of art by the Nazis; with the subsequent refusal of the Austrian state to return the art or to acknowledge a theft had taken place, Czernin described the situation as \\"a double crime\\". Maria Altmann, a niece of Adele and Ferdinand, in 2010 Altmann, then living in the US, hired E. Randol Schoenberg to act on her behalf. Schoenberg was the son of a woman she had been friends with since they lived in Vienna. They filed a claim with the restitution committee for the return of six paintings: Adele Bloch-Bauer I, Adele Bloch-Bauer II, Apfelbaum I, Buchenwald, H√§user in Unterach am Attersee and Amalie Zuckerkandl. The committee turned down the request, again citing Adele's will as the reason they were retaining the works. The committee's decision recommended that 16 Klimt drawings and 19 pieces of porcelain that had been held by Ferdinand and Adele and which were still at the Galerie Belvedere should be returned, as they fell outside the request of the will. In March 2000 Altmann filed a civil claim against the Austrian government for the return of the paintings. She was informed that the cost of filing (consisting of 1.2% of the amount in question, plus a filing fee), would have meant a fee of ‚Ç¨1.75 million. To avoid the prohibitively high costs, Altmann and Schoenberg sued the Austrian government and the Galerie Belvedere in the US courts. The Austrian government filed for dismissal, with arguments based on the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (1976). The Act granted immunity to sovereign nations except under certain conditions. Schoenberg showed that three of the conditions pertinent to the case were that Altmann's property had been taken in violation of international law; the property was owned by the state in question, or one of its agencies; and that the property had been used on a commercial basis in the US. Over four years of litigation followed as to whether the case could be brought against a sovereign state before it was brought before the Supreme Court in Republic of Austria v. Altmann. In June 2004 the Supreme Court determined that the paintings had been stolen and that Austria was not immune from a claim from Altmann; the court made no comment on the current ownership of the paintings. Public poster concerning the departure of the painting from Austria To avoid returning to the courts in what could have been lengthy litigation process, arbitration in Austria was agreed upon by both parties, although the Austrians had turned down such a move in 1999. Three arbitrators formed the panel, Andreas N√∂dl, Walter Rechberger and Peter Rummel. Schoenberg gave evidence before them in September 2005 and, in January 2006, they delivered their judgement. They stated that five of the six paintings in question should be returned to the Bloch-Bauer estate, as outlined in Ferdinand's will; only the Portrait of Amalie Zuckerkandl was to be retained by the gallery. After the panel's decision was announced, the Galerie Belvedere ran a series of advertisements that appeared in bus stops and on underground railway platforms. The posters said \\"Ciao Adele\\", advertising the last opportunity before the painting left the country and long queues formed around the block. Although there were calls from some Austrians for the state to purchase the five paintings, the government stated that the price would be too high to justify the expense. The paintings were exported from Austria in March 2006 and exhibited together at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art from April to June that year. When Altmann was asked what she wanted to do with the paintings, she stated \\"I would not want any private person to buy these paintings, ... It is very meaningful to me that they are seen by anybody who wants to see them, because that would have been the wish of my aunt.\\" In June 2006 the Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I was sold to Ronald Lauder for $135 million, at the time a record price for a painting. Eileen Kinsella, the editor of ARTnews, considered the high price was due to several factors, particularly the painting's provenance, the increasing demand for Austrian Expressionism, rising prices in the art world and \\"Lauder's passion for and pursuit of this particular work\\". Lauder placed the work in the Neue Galerie, the New York-based gallery he co-founded. The painting has been on display at the location since. Michael Kimmelman, the chief art critic for the New York Times, was critical of the sale, and wrote that \\"A story about justice and redemption after the Holocaust has devolved into yet another tale of the crazy, intoxicating art market.\\" Altmann said of the sale that it was not practical for her, or her relatives who were also part of the estate, to retain any of the paintings. In November 2006 the remaining four Klimt paintings were sold at Christie's auction house. Adele Bloch-Bauer II sold for $87.9 million, Apfelbaum I for $33 million, Buchenwald for $40.3 million and H√§user in Unterach am Attersee for $31 million. All went to private collections. Legacy The history of the Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I and the other paintings taken from the Bloch-Bauers has been recounted in three documentary films, Stealing Klimt (2007), The Rape of Europa (2007) and Adele's Wish (2008). The painting's history is described in the 2012 book The Lady in Gold: The Extraordinary Tale of Gustav Klimt's Masterpiece, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, by the journalist Anne-Marie O'Connor. The history, as well as other stories of other stolen art, is told by Melissa M√ºller and Monika Tatzkow in Lost Lives, Lost Art: Jewish Collectors, Nazi Art Theft, and the Quest for Justice, published in 2010. The story of Adele Bloch-Bauer and Maria Altmann formed the basis for the 2017 novel Stolen Beauty by Laurie Lico Albanese. The portrait is featured in the memoir of Gregor Collins, The Accidental Caregiver, about his relationship with Maria Altmann, published in August 2012. The book was dramatised for the stage in January 2015. In 2015 Altmann's story was dramatised for the film Woman in Gold starring Helen Mirren as Maria and Ryan Reynolds as Schoenberg. Altmann died in February 2011, aged 94. Schoenberg, who had worked on a 40 per cent conditional fee throughout, received $54 million for the sale of Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I and $55 million for the sale of the remaining four paintings. After he donated over $7 million for the building of the new premises of the Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust, he said that he had \\"tried to do good things with the money\\". He subsequently specialised in the restitution of artwork plundered by the Nazis.

An anti-imperialist satirical farce, it concerns the exploits of the titular superhero and his sidekick, Marie-Madeleine (Delphine Seyrig), as they try to prevent a Communist takeover of France and solve the murder of another American superhero, Captain Formidable. In addition to Seyrig, the film features cameos by Donald Pleasence and Philippe Noiret, as well as the musician Serge Gainsbourg. Plot summary Mr. Freedom (John Abbey) is a Washington D.C. police officer who moonlights as a government-sanctioned, vigilante superhero. After the 1968 Washington, D.C., riots, he is summoned to the Freedom Tower-- an office building housing the U.S.'s most powerful companies- to meet with Dr. Freedom (Donald Pleasence), his handler, who informs him that another superhero, Captain Formidable, has been killed in France by operatives of the mysterious French Anti-Freedom (FAF)A pun on the French slang term faf ‚Äúfascist‚Äù. organization. Warning that this could be the first salvo in a Soviet invasion, Dr. Freedom dispatches Mr. Freedom to investigate his death and bring France back under the sway of western capitalist influences. As a last resort, Dr. Freedom equips him with \\"the big one,\\" a portable nuclear device to destroy the country in the event that it falls to Communist influence. In France, Mr. Freedom joins forces with Captain Formidable's sidekick, the femme fatale Marie-Madeleine, to lead his own anti-communist Freedom organization; Marie-Madeleine explains that she and Captain Formidable ran a string of state-sponsored brothels, using the money they earned to finance anti-Communist activities while also gathering intelligence on the various diplomats and politicians who use their services. Arriving at a pro-USA rally, Mr. Freedom delivers an extended speech extolling the virtues of democracy and capitalism while also espousing white nationalist sympathies and warning of the encroaching influence of African Americans, Jews, Asians, and other \\"undesirables\\" on the national stage. Assembling an army from the attendees of the rally, he expresses his intention not only to secure France against Communist influence, but also build a \\"white wall of freedom\\" around the United States. Mr. Freedom travels to the U.S. embassy (a supermarket) to meet with the American ambassador to France, who warns him of the influence of a pair of foreign superheroes-- the Russian Stalinist Muzhik Man and Chinese Maoist Red China Man-- have been exerting in the country. Mr. Freedom meets with his French counterpart, Super French Man, who expresses sympathies with their Communist ideologies, prompting Mr. Freedom to kill his sidekicks. Later he meets in a metro tunnel with Muzhik Man and Red China Man (the latter a giant, talking Chinese Dragon) and the three discuss the virtues of their various political ideologies; Muzhik Man makes friendly overtures to Mr. Freedom and disavows responsibility for the death of Captain Formidable. After he accidentally knocks himself unconscious, Muzhik Man takes Mr. Freedom back to Communist Party headquarters to recuperate; after waking up, Mr. Freedom kills Muzhik Man's girlfriend, Marie-Rouge. Returning to Marie- Madeleine's apartment to have sex with her, Mr. Freedom suffers a crisis of conscience when her son calls him a fascist; he later realizes that his guilt is in fact coming from Red China Man, who is broadcasting subliminal messages to a radio receiver hidden in one of his teeth. After having the tooth removed, Mr. Freedom oversees the construction of a secret base from which his operatives can carry out anti-communist activities in France, and delivers a speech that works his followers into a violent frenzy, prompting them to begin looting, raping, and rioting. In response, the French begin holding anti-US demonstrations. Mr. Freedom opens fire into a crowd of peaceful protestors with a machine gun, to the horror of Marie-Madeleine, who subsequently reveals herself as an ally of Red Chinaman and a member of FAF. She further admits that she was the one who killed Captain Formidable. Mr. Freedom kills her, but FAF forces, demonstrators, and Mr. Muzhik's soliders- seeking revenge for Marie-Rouge's death- breach his compound and kill the rest of his followers. Resolving that France neither wants nor deserves American democracy, Mr. Freedom detonates \\"The Big One;\\" in a cutaway, Dr. Freedom admits that he really supplied Mr. Freedom with a \\"medium one;\\" the resultant explosion kills Mr. Freedom but leaves everyone else unharmed, and the French continue their anti-US rally.

It was equal to the larger chous of the Ancient Greeks. The congius contained six sextarii. Cato tells us that he was wont to give each of his slaves a congius of wine at the Saturnalia and Compitalia.De Re Rustica, c57 Pliny relates, among other examples of hard drinking, that a Novellius Torquatus of Mediolanum obtained a cognomen (Tricongius, a nine-bottle-man) by drinking three congii of wine at once: The Roman system of weights and measures, including the congius, was introduced to Britain in the 1st century by Emperor Claudius. Following the Anglo-Saxon invasions of the 4th and 5th century, Roman units were, for the most part, replaced with North German units. Following the conversion of England to Christianity in the 7th century, Latin became the language of state. From this time on the word \\"congius\\" is simply the Latin word for gallon. Thus we find the word congius mentioned in a charter of Edmund I in 946. In Apothecary Measures, the Latin Congius (abbreviation c.) is used for the Queen Anne gallon of 231 cubic inches, also known as the US gallon.  Congius of Vespasian  William Smith in his book A dictionary of Greek and Roman antiquities says: ::There is a congius in existence called the congius of Vespasian or the Farnese congius, bearing an inscription, which states that it was made in the year 75 A.D., according to the standard measure in the capitol, and that it contained, by weight, ten pounds. (Imp. Caes. vi. T. Caes. Aug. F. iiii. Cos. Mensurae exactae in Capitolio, P. x.; see also Festus, Publica Pondera.) By means of this congius the weight of the Roman pound has been ascertained. This congius holds, according to an experiment made by Dr. Hase, in 1824, 52037.692 grains of distilled water.Festus, De verborum significatu, s.v. \\"Publica Pondera\\" In 1866, an article entitled On a Congius appeared in the Journal of the British Archaeological Association casting doubt on the authenticity of the Farnese congius. A 1926 article in the journal Ancient Weights and Measures notes that \\"there is no true patina upon it\\" and that apparent red oxide is drops of shellac. The 2002 book Aqueduct hunting in the seventeenth century: Raffaello Fabretti's De aquis et aquaeductibus veteris Romae by Harry B. Evans reports that the original congius of Farnese has been lost and that the extant copies are considered spurious. On the other hand, according to the 1883 edition of A complete handbook to the National museum in Naples item number 74599 bears the following description: :74599.

They are a highly intelligent species of telepathic plants. Publication history The Cotati first appeared in The Avengers vol. 1, #133 (May 1975) and were created by Steve Englehart and Sal Buscema. Fictional history Long ago, the Cotati were humanoid in form, with branches which served as rudimentary limbs enabling them slow travel, and a torso topped by a distinct head with a semi-human face featuring two eyes above what looked like a mouth. The Cotati later allowed evolution to strip them of their mobility while concentrated their efforts on developing telepathic abilities. As a result, the species legs, torso and head merged into a single trunk-like body which was rooted firmly to the ground, and their faces became increasingly less evident until eventually no trace of any facial features remained. Most Cotati now look like simple, unremarkable trees although some have more distinctive appearances which include faces. The Cotati originated on Hala in the Pama star system in the Large Magellanic Cloud, the same planet as the warlike humanoid Kree race. Despite their aggressive nature, the Kree ignored the Cotati because they believed that all plants were beneath their notice. Approximately one million Earth years ago, Hala was visited by a starship from the Skrull empire (at that time, the Skrulls were a benevolent race). The Skrulls wished to include Hala in their empire and offered its inhabitants their knowledge and technology in exchange for their loyalty and Hala's resources. To avoid any dissension regarding which of the two races would represent Hala to them, the Skrulls proposed a test of worthiness in which equal numbers of Kree and Cotati would be taken to different uninhabited worlds and left there with complete supplies for one year. At the end of that period, whichever group had done the most with themselves would be adjudged the most worthy. Both races agreed to these terms and the Skrulls transported 17 Cotati to a barren moon in an unspecified solar system. The Skrulls then transported 17 Kree to Earth's Moon and provided them with an artificial atmosphere and rudimentary technology. The Kree used their time to build a gargantuan city. The Skrulls who came to retrieve the Kree were extremely impressed and the Kree felt confident that they would be victorious. However, upon returning to Hala, the Kree contestants were informed by their fellows that the other Skrulls (those who had retrieved the Cotati) were more impressed by their transformation of their barren moon into a park full of plant life. Enraged, the Kree decided to try and win by destroying their competitors. They quickly exterminated all of the Cotati, when the Kree informed the Skrulls of how they had solved the problem of Hala's representation to them. The outraged Skrulls reacted by promising to reject Hala forever, said Kree barbarians slaughtered the Skrull delegation as well and seized their starship and all of its tremendously advanced technology for themselves, to which they would use to arm for war against the Skrulls eons later.Avengers #133 (March 1975). Marvel Comics. While the fascistic Kree battled the Skrulls for millennia, radically warping a once-benevolent society into an ultra-militaristic state, on their own homeworld. Their act of genocide against the Cotati was not as complete as they had thought: a new generation of Cotati had sprung forth from seed pods dropped by the previous generation as they died. Unnoticed by the Kree, these new Cotati went into hiding and allowed themselves to evolve into an immobile species with greater telepathic abilities. Centuries later, the Cotati made contact with a small number of Kree who were members of a secretive pacifist sect and formed an alliance with them. A century later, these pacifist Kree were known as the Priests of Pama and their temples contained secret cellars in which the now even more evolved Cotati were safely hidden and kept alive. However, when the Supreme Intelligence exiled the Priests to a barren prison planet, the Cotati aided them by influencing a cosmic menace known as the Star-Stalker to choose that planet as his next meal. The Priests discovered a means of countering the threat and forced it to flee, as the Cotati had been confident they would do. The Priests begged an audience with the Supreme Intelligence to warn it of the Star-Stalker but the Supreme Intelligence suspected that they had created a fictitious threat so that they would be brought back to the safety of Hala, something it refused to ever allow. The Priests then proposed that they be allowed to protect the inhabited worlds of the cosmos by sending teams of two to those worlds to remain there like Sentries until needed. Since this plan would keep the dissidents away from Hala while terminating the cost of their upkeep on the prison planet, the Supreme Intelligence accepted this proposal and the Priests of Pama were freed to leave. Unbeknownest to anyone, each pair of Priests took with them a group of plants who were actually Cotati.Avengers #134 (April 1975). Marvel Comics. Almost all Cotati were smuggled away from Hala to settle in temples created and maintained by the Priests of Pama on out-of-the-way planets. Those few on Earth have played a role in the lives of various superheroes, including the Avengers and the Silver Surfer. The artificial environment created for the competition between the Kree and the Cotati still stands; today it is known as the Blue Area of the Moon, and is the location of the dwelling of Uatu the Watcher; it was for several years also the location of the Inhumans' city of Attilan. The Blue Area is also the site of the first recorded \\"death\\" of the Phoenix Force during the now-classic Dark Phoenix Saga.Uncanny X-Men #137 (September 1980). Marvel Comics.

The eldest of Earth's Cotati still using the Swordsman's body and Sequoia have since reappeared on the Blue Area of the Moon after the oxygen-rich area was revitalized. They request the Avengers help to avoid another Cotati massacre by the Kree/Skrull Alliance. Thor was able to bring some storms into the Blue Area of the Moon to continue their growth. Sequoiah even hinted that Hulkling is heading up the Kree/Skrull alliance. Thanks to a rousing speech from Iron Man, the team all agreed to defend the Cotati and figure out the politics afterwards unaware that the Fantastic Four are already among the Kree/Skrull Alliance.Empyre: Avengers #0.

Thor then uses the blessing of Gaea to make the barren planet filled with life. This was enough to appease Quoi as Thor takes Invisible Woman and Franklin back to the others.

After the switch from \\"The Cruise\\" (which never branded itself as being on FM) to \\"Rock 105.5\\" (which only brands itself as being on FM), a construction permit was granted to WHLS to move the translator to their parent station's tower on 32nd Street in Port Huron Township. The station currently broadcasts with only 49 watts but from a much higher tower and covers the immediate Port Huron, Fort Gratiot, and Marysville areas.http://radio- locator.com/info/W288BT-FX After the move to the WHLS tower, 105.5 FM began broadcasting information that would be received on Radio Data System (RDS) radios. One reasoning of Liggett Communications getting the 105.5 FM translator, is due to both WHLS and WHLX having limited nighttime range.

In 1932, New York's Cue was the first city-specific listings magazine. With the expansion of broadcast media many others have followed, expanding the format to include columns about media production and personalities, such as TV Hebdo (Qu√©bec) in Canada, TV Guide in the US and hundreds of others worldwide. Broadcast guides are normally published either with a Saturday or Sunday newspaper or are published weekly or fortnightly. It has become a highly competitive area of publishing. Other listings magazines have started from a primary base in cultural events, such as Time Out magazine in the UK. Most major cities worldwide have one or many more such publications. During the politically charged 1970s and 1980s, many of these magazines, in the UK at least, played a progressive role as part of the alternative press and had a reputation for leftward leaning investigative and campaigning journalism. They were some of the first consumer magazines to carry lists of \\"agitprop\\" events. City Limits was probably the most outspoken of all UK-based listings magazines but almost all followed Time Out‚Äôs lead of including space for lesbian and gay events and clubs.

He is best known for resisting an invasion by Wei's rival state, Eastern Wu, at the Battle of Hefei in 253. Life Zhang Te was from Zhuo Commandery (), which is around present-day Zhuozhou, Hebei. He started his career as an Officer of the Standard () under the Wei general Zhuge Dan, who held the appointment of General Who Guards the East () from 251 to 252. After Guanqiu Jian took over the position of General Who Guards the East from Zhuge Dan, he put Zhang Te in charge of guarding Xincheng (Êñ∞Âüé; literally \\"new city\\"), a fortress at Hefei. In 253, Zhuge Ke, the regent of Wei's rival state Eastern Wu, led Wu forces to attack Xincheng and surrounded the fortress. Zhang Te, along with Yue Fang () and others, led 3,000 troops to defend Xincheng. During this time, he sent his subordinates Liu Zheng () and Zheng Xiang () to break out of the siege and seek reinforcements, but Zhuge Ke's men intercepted and captured them. In desperation, Zhang Te lied to the enemy: \\"I've no intention of fighting now. However, according to the laws of Wei, when I'm under attack for more than 100 days and reinforcements do not arrive, even if I surrender, my family will be spared from punishment. Since I first started resisting the enemy, it has been more than 90 days. This city originally had a population of more than 4,000, and now more than half of them have died in battle.

Zhang Te and his remaining troops then seized the opportunity to make repairs to the walls and strengthen their defences overnight. The following morning, Zhang Te told the enemy: \\"We shall fight to the death!\\" Zhuge Ke turned furious when he realised he had been fooled, so he ordered his troops to mount a fierce assault on the fortress. However, his troops were already exhausted and weary after several days of siege, and they failed to breach Xincheng's walls.

Devised by Norman, Rhoda and Peter Florence in 1988, the festival was described by Bill Clinton in 2001 as \\"The Woodstock of the mind\\". Tony Benn said: \\"In my mind it's replaced Christmas\\". Peter Florence continues to be director of the Festival. It has become a prominent festival in British culture, and sessions at the festival have been recorded for television and radio programmes such as The Readers' and Writers' Roadshow and The One Show. All the BBC's national radio channels apart from Radio One have been involved in broadcasting from the festival, and Sky Arts showed highlights of the festival from 2010 until 2013, handing over the main coverage to the BBC for the 2014 event. History Sign at the entrance to the 2016 Hay Festival. Hay-on-Wye was already well known for its many bookshops before the festival was launched. Richard Booth opened his first shop there in 1962, and by the 1970s Hay had gained the nickname \\"The Town of Books\\". From its inception, the festival was held at a variety of venues around Hay, including the local Primary School, until 2005 when it moved to a unified location just south of the town. The Guardian was the main sponsor of the festival from 2002 to 2010, succeeding The Sunday Times. The Daily Telegraph and its associated brands in Telegraph Media Group had two terms as three-year sponsors, starting with the 2011 festival. From 2017, the Tata Group and Baillie Gifford are among the principal sponsors, along with the BBC and many non-media companies such as the Arts Council of Wales and the British Council. The festival has expanded over the years to include musical performances and film previews. A children's festival, \\"Hay Fever\\", runs alongside the main festival. It has also expanded internationally and sister festivals take place in Aarhus, Arequipa, Nairobi, Dhaka, Zacatecas, the Maldives, Kerala at Thiruvananthapuram, Beirut, Belfast, Cartagena, the Alhambra Palace, Parc Prison in Bridgend and Segovia. In 2009 Hay Festival also took on the ailing Brecon Jazz Festival. It is run by a not- for-profit company, and entrance is free to everyone. The 2012 festival included writers Martin Amis, Jung Chang, Louis de Berni√®res, Mark Haddon, Mario Vargas Llosa, Hilary Mantel, Ian McEwan, Michael Morpurgo, Ben Okri, Ian Rankin, Salman Rushdie, Owen Sheers, Jeanette Winterson, comedians Bill Bailey, Rob Brydon, Julian Clary, Jack Dee, Tim Minchin, politicians Peter Hain and Boris Johnson, scientists John D. Barrow, Martin Rees, Simon Singh, and general speakers Harry Belafonte, William Dalrymple, Stephen Fry, A. C. Grayling, Germaine Greer, Michael Ignatieff, and David Starkey. In 2020 the festival was held digitally online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Awards The Hay Festival was one of 11 Welsh winners of The Queen's Awards for Enterprise for 2009. The 2009 festival included writers Carol Ann Duffy, David Simon, Stephen Fry, David Nicholls, Jenny Valentine and Melvyn Bragg, scientists Martin Rees and Sabine Bahn, economists Anthony Giddens, Nicholas Stern, Howard Davies and Danny Quah, comedians Dylan Moran, Dara √ì Briain and Sandi Toksvig, and general speakers David Frost, Desmond Tutu, Rowan Williams and Rhodri Morgan. Abu Dhabi Controversies Some of the biggest NGOs and bestselling authors signed a letter condemning abuse of free speech in Abu Dhabi as the 2020 Hay Festival commenced in Abu Dhabi in February. Authors who signed the letter included the likes of Stephen Fry, Noam Chomsky, Jung Chang to Bernardine Evaristo and NGOs such as Amnesty International and PEN International, condemned the abuse of free speech in the United Arab Emirates which led to the arrest and abuse of human rights advocate Ahmed Mansoor, who by the time of the festival was held in solitary confinement to serve a 10-year prison time.

Chevrolet Staff engineer, designer, and race car driver Zora Arkus-Duntov started development of the CERV I in 1959, and began work on the CERV II in 1963. Chevrolet chief engineer Don Runkle and Lotus' Tony Rudd discussed creating a new show car to demonstrate their engineering expertise in 1985; It would become the CERV III. Corvette chief engineer Dave Hill unveiled the CERV IV in 1993, a test vehicle for the 1997 C5 Corvette. CERV I 1959 Chevrolet Engineering Research Vehicle Zora Arkus-Duntov, Chevrolet staff engineer, designer, and race car driver, started development of the \\"CERV I\\" (Chevrolet Experimental Racing Vehicle) in 1959, which was unveiled to the public at the Riverside International Raceway November 1960, under the name \\"CERV I\\" (Chevrolet Experimental Research Vehicle). =Overview= CERV-I (Chevrolet Engineering Research Vehicle) was developed as a research tool for that company's continuous efforts to understand automotive ride and handling phenomena under the most realistic conditions. The car was built at the Chevrolet Engineering Center at Warren, Michigan. The primary function of the \\"CERV-1\\", was to provide Chevrolet engineers with a test platform from which direct visual studies were made from all types of ride and handling behavior under amplified conditions. The stated function of the \\"CERV-1\\" largely determines its concept and final configuration. In order to realistically amplify vehicle responses to handling and road stimuli, the performance capability of the vehicle must be extended far beyond that of regular passenger cars. In other words, a high power-to-weight ratio is mandatory. By such means, suspension phenomena that are extremely subtle, and thus difficult to isolate within the performance capabilities of a regular passenger car, may be studied and treated quantitatively with the \\"CERV-1\\". Another fundamental factor in the experimental car's design is the visibility afforded by the body design. The streamlined, abbreviated body encloses the engine, transaxle, engine cooling system, and provide an open cockpit for the driver, from which all four wheels, in contact with the ground, are clearly visible. Some broad features of the \\"CERV-I\\" are: extremely light weight to afford a horsepower- to-weight ratio such as that usually associated with high performance aircraft; rear mounted engine in unit with a fully synchronized four-speed transaxle; the only passenger, the driver, sits well forward on the centerline of the car for virtually optimum visibility, and all four wheels are independently suspended to provide a high order of stability and positive handling. The wheelbase is and the car weighs approximately 1600 pounds (726 kg), ready to run. The chassis is an extremely stiff frame of chrome- molybdenum steel tubes welded into a truss-like structure weighing approximately 125 pounds (57 kg). The lightweight body (approximately 80 pounds (36 kg)) is aerodynamically styled and fully encloses the underside of the car. The body is fabricated of a glass fiber reinforced plastic somewhat thinner than that used in the Corvette body. The wheels are completely exposed to permit visual observation of tire-to-road contact during handling studies. =Powertrain= Power for the \\"CERV-I\\" is supplied by a specially developed, lightweight version of the Chevrolet 283-cubic-inch. V-8 that develops and weighs only 350 pounds (159 kg). Such specific output, only one pound per horsepower, is rarely achieved in reciprocating engines, even in the most highly developed aircraft types. The dramatic reduction of weight was gained by using aluminum for the cylinder block, cylinder heads, water pump, starter motor body, flywheel, and clutch pressure plate. In the cylinder block, no bore liners are used and the pistons run directly on specially treated aluminum bores. Magnesium is used for the clutch housing, fuel injection manifold, and manifold adapter plate. Weight savings achieved through the use of lighter metals in the engine and clutch is in excess of 175 pounds (79 kg). A number of special design features help the engine to develop . A special fuel injection unit has ram tubes of larger cross section and 2510 longer than those of the regular production design. Individual exhaust pipes of a tuned length empty into large collector pipes and no mufflers are used. No cooling fan is required or used, and the water pump speed is reduced 30% by the use of a smaller crankshaft pulley. A small, 5-ampere generator is used in conjunction with a lightweight aircraft type battery In addition to the aluminum water pump mentioned previously, the engine cooling system consists of an aluminum radiator mounted forward of the driver, and two oil cooler radiators mounted one on each side of the main radiator. Power from the engine is transmitted in a conventional manner through the lightweight flywheel, clutch, and Corvette type four-speed transmission. Attaching directly to the rear end of the transmission case is the differential and final drive gear mechanism. A feature of the final drive gears is the ability to quickly change ratios so that vehicle performance can be as quickly tailored to a new environment. Power transmission to the wheels is completed through individual axle shafts with universal joints on each end, or a total of four in-all. In 1972, Hot Rod magazine tested a prototype Chevrolet Vega featuring the all- aluminum V8. The fitted engine was the last of several units used in the CERV I Corvette research and development in the late 1950s, bored out to for the Vega application. Hot Rods road test of the prototype with Turbo Hydramatic, stock Vega differential, and street tires yielded quarter mile (~400 m) times under 14 seconds.Hot Rod, July 1972. =Suspension, steering, and brakes= The interesting rear suspension permits independent action of each wheel. Vertical movements of the wheels are controlled by two links, in which the upper link doubles as the axle shaft; and a rod, rubber bushed on each end as the lower. A third link runs from each rear wheel hub forward to the frame to transmit driving and braking thrust. Variable rate coil springs unitized with direct, double-acting shock absorbers are diagonally mounted at each rear wheel. Adjustment provisions in the rear suspension linkage permit variations in camber and toe-in to facilitate engineering studies. Front suspension is independent with high roll center geometry, and also utilizes unitized variable rate coil springs and shock absorbers as in the rear suspension. An 11/16\\" stabilizer bar interconnects the front wheels. The independent rear suspension design became the basis of the 1963 Corvette Sting Ray suspension. So that weight distribution during tests shall vary little if any, two fuel cells of rubber construction and total capacity of 20 gallons, are located on either side of the \\"CERV-I\\" at approximately the fore and aft location of the center of gravity. Thus, the amount of fuel in the tanks at any given moment will have virtually no effect on weight distribution. Brakes on the \\"CERV-I\\" are similar to the HD type available on the Chevrolet Corvette. Sintered iron linings are used with fin cooled drums, and the brake drum webs are lightened by drilled lightening holes which also permit the flow of cooling air. The brake drums are cast aluminum with cast-in iron braking surfaces. The rear brakes are inboard mounted next to the differential so that braking torque is transmitted directly to the frame without influencing any of the rear wheel articulating members. Braking effort distribution is 57% front and 43% rear to take advantage of the superior braking characteristics of the weight distribution afforded by the rear engine type vehicle. The brakes may be actuated by either one of two pedals so that the driver may use either foot depending on the particular driving situation. An unusual brake master cylinder utilizes two pistons operating in series so that it either the front or rear brakes fail the remaining brakes can be actuated. The steering system features a high-efficiency re-circulating ball type steering gear of 12:1 ratio. Steering linkage is forward mounted and is of a balanced relay link type. The overall steering ratio is a very fast 13.5:1 and only 2 1/4 turns of the steering wheel are required from lock-to-lock. Wheels are of cast magnesium alloy with knock-off hubs to facilitate quick changing. Wheels of 15\\", 16\\", 17\\" and 18\\" diameters with rim width of 5¬Ω\\", 6\\", and 8\\" are used.Chevrolet Engineering Department November 14, 1960 The car is currently on display in Detroit, Michigan at the Renaissance Center on level A within the GM World display space. CERV II 1964 Chevrolet Engineering Research Vehicle II Zora Arkus-Duntov began work on the CERV II in 1963, which was completed in 1964. The original plan was to build six cars, three for competition and three spares. The body was styled by Larry Shinoda and Tony Lapine. To achieve superior performance, the car was built on a monocoque chassis, powered by a 377 ci all-aluminum SOHC V8 with Hilborn injection rated at . Some test results indicated it had a top speed of , and 0-60 mph in 2.8 to 3.0 seconds. Transmission is a 2-speed on each of the front and rear axles, with transferable torque between axles. The top speed was reported by Victory By Design to be . In 1970, CERV II was used to test tire with a ZL-1 engine. This vehicle and the CERV I were later donated to the Briggs Cunningham Museum, in Costa Mesa, California. The 1964 CERV II chassis number P-3910 (with engine number T1212E 2-92199-A, previously owned by the Briggs Cunningham Museum, Miles Collier Jr., John Moores) was sold in 2013 RM New York auction for $1,000,000 ($1,100,000 after buyer's premium).1964 Chevrolet CERV II concept going up for auctionLot 139 1964 Chevrolet CERV IIExperimental Chevrolet CERV II to cross the block in New York CERV III 1986 Corvette Indy The project would become the CERV III (Corporate Engineering Research Vehicle III) was first unveiled at Detroit Automobile Show in January 1986 as the Corvette Indy prototype car.

It is worth noting that the power automorphism of an infinite group may not restrict to an automorphism on each subgroup. For instance, the automorphism on rational numbers that sends each number to its double is a power automorphism even though it does not restrict to an automorphism on each subgroup. Alternatively, power automorphisms are characterized as automorphisms that send each element of the group to some power of that element. This explains the choice of the term power. The power automorphisms of a group form a subgroup of the whole automorphism group. This subgroup is denoted as Pot(G) where G is the group. A universal power automorphism is a power automorphism where the power to which each element is raised is the same. For instance, each element may go to its cube. Here are some facts about the powering index: * The powering index must be relatively prime to the order of each element. In particular, it must be relatively prime to the order of the group, if the group is finite. * If the group is abelian, any powering index works. * If the powering index 2 or -1 works, then the group is abelian. The group of power automorphisms commutes with the group of inner automorphisms when viewed as subgroups of the automorphism group. Thus, in particular, power automorphisms that are also inner must arise as conjugations by elements in the second group of the upper central series.

Its programming is also simulcasted on FM Translator W224DT, licensed to Port Huron, Michigan at 92.7 mHz, with an effective radiated power of 125 watts. The station currently broadcasts an Adult album alternative/Americana format branded as 92.7 WHLX The Hills. History The station started as WSDC in 1951, then WDOG and later became WSMA with country music. =Early years= The history of this station dates back to December 1947, when Radio St. Clair applied for a construction permit for the station to be built in Algonac, Michigan, about 15 miles south of Marine City, and to operate at a power of 500 watts. The permit was amended the following year to change its proposed city of license from Algonac to Marine City. The year after that, the land on which to build the transmitter facility along Marine City highway was selected, and the license was amended to reflect a power increase from 500 to 1,000 watts, and to adopt a two-tower directional antenna pattern. WHLX went on the air on December 10, 1951 with the call letters WSDC, operating from its transmitter facility at 5300 Marine City Highway, on the outskirts of Marine City. Doing business as Radio St. Clair, Inc., Jerry Coughlin served as the station's first president and general manager. By 1954, Coughlin had turned the duties of general manager to sales director John Bell and renamed the station WDOG. Fred Cale assumed sales and management duties by 1960. =Failed Move Attempt= In November 1963, Radio St. Clair applied for a construction permit to move the station closer to Detroit. The proposed site was located at 2676 Ten Mile Road in Warren, currently the site of Central Industrial Park. Radio St. Clair also petitioned for a power increase from 1,000 to 5,000 watts as well as a modified directional antenna system that would have included a three-tower system. The FCC returned the application a year later, on the grounds of frequency overlap restrictions. Radio St. Clair requested a waiver, which was denied as was the construction permit for the move. =First sale= In November 1966, Radio St. Clair agreed to sell WDOG to Sommerville Broadcasting Company, owned by Richard S. and Letty J. Sommerville, which was approved by the FCC in February 1967. Later that year, the station, which up to that point, had been licensed to operate only from sunrise to sunset, was granted pre-sunrise authority of 500 watts, which allowed it to sign on two hours prior to local sunrise. Sommerville also renamed the station WSMA, and adopted a country music format. It maintained this format and call sign for the next 26 years. A disadvantage that the station had for much of its history was its geographic separation from more profitable markets. Located about 12 miles from any kind of urban sprawl, it had difficulty attaching itself to another community for more profit potential, as retail business in tiny Marine City was unable to provide a steady source of revenue, even during AM's halcyon years. For a time, WSMA maintained a small sales office in Port Huron, across the street from competitors WHLS and WSAQ. Despite the challenges, WSMA produced a modest profit during its early years. The Port Huron office closed when the station began to fail in the late 1980s, not long after coming under the control of a new owner. Those failures arose out of an overall lack of dependability of the station, often shutting down operations at sunset (even after being granted nighttime power authorization), and sometimes not going on air at all during holidays and some weekends. =Second sale= On May 17, 1987, Richard S. Sommerville, who by this time owned WCEN-AM/FM in Mount Pleasant, sold WSMA to Frink, Inc., under a land contract agreement to pay for the station in monthly installments of $1,845. However, in a letter to the FCC dated November 7, 1990, Washington attorney Earl Stanley stated that Sommerville resumed control of WSMA after Frink Inc. failed to meet its financial obligations, prompting a foreclosure civil action in the Circuit Court of St. Clair County. Frink Inc. was declared in default on May 7, 1990, and was given 180 days to bring its monetary obligations to Sommerville from that date. Frink was required to pay more than $30,000 in unpaid promissory note payments and real estate taxes, according to court papers, putting its total amount owed to more than $150,000. The debts were not satisfied, and as of November 3, 1990, the 181st day of the notice, Sommerville recaptured the license, and assumed the role of trustee. =Reborn: WIFN-AM= WIFN's two directional antenna broadcast towers, located at 5300 Marine City Highway in Marine City, in 1996. The unused WIFN station remote van sits next to the right tower. Hoping to restore WSMA to its former glory, broadcasters David Barr and Rick Schremp formed Barr/Schremp Communications in 1993 and took control of WSMA that year. Coincidentally, Barr's father William was the former owner of WATC AM 900 & WZXM FM 95.3 (now 101.5 WMJZ) in Gaylord, 220 miles north of Detroit, before selling it in 1986. Barr/Schremp Communications changed the station's call letters to WIFN, and began a gradual phase-out of the country music format in favor of personality talk. Under the new format, the station bore such talents such as G. Gordon Liddy, Larry King, Chuck Harder and Sports Byline USA. Ken Hawk and Dave Haze handled news duties, with Marty Simmonds serving as sports director. The station experienced an increase in revenue under the new format and owners. Barr and Schremp dissolved their partnership two years after taking control of WIFN, with Schremp pursuing other interests. In 1997 Barr sold the station to Hanson Communications, then- licensee of WPHM-AM and WBTI-FM in Port Huron, one of WIFN's longtime competitors. Given multiple job offers after the sale, Barr then moved north to Traverse City, where he assumed a promotions and marketing role with country music powerhouse WTCM. =\\"Real Country\\"= Following completion of the sale in late 1997, country music returned with \\"Real Country\\" via satellite from the ABC/SMN radio network, after a brief period of simulcasting with CHR/Hot AC sister station WBTI 96.9 FM. WIFN became WHYT (picking up the calls dumped by Detroit's 96.3 FM, now WDVD) under the \\"Real Country\\" format. Hanson Communications also moved the station's on-air operations from its longtime location at 5300 Marine City Highway to its main base of operations at 2379 Military Street in Port Huron. Most administrative functions were handled by the existing staff of Hanson Communications, and Hanson's sales force dedicated their same aggression to selling WHYT as they did their two other properties. By 2000, Hanson Communications sold 1590 WHYT to Liggett Communications (now Radio First). Liggett, who was also in the process of acquiring Hanson's competitor, WHLS-AM and WSAQ-FM, decided to co-locate all five stations at 808 Huron Street, which was the main base of operations for WHLS and WSAQ, and had enough space for expansion, unlike the Military Street facility. =WHLS simulcast= Recognizing the opportunity to extend WHLS's signal to the southern Thumb area of Michigan, Liggett Communications abandoned the \\"Real Country\\" format and moniker, and simulcast WHLS's programming. WHYT changed its call letters to WHLX, to more closely match that of its sister station. The move allowed WHLS to be heard as far south as Warren, Michigan in Macomb County and as far north as Sandusky, Michigan in Sanilac County. Its directional covers most of Macomb County, eastern Lapeer County, and most of Lambton County Ontario. The station very briefly simulcasted WPHM Port Huron in late December 2017 but had reverted to the WHLS simulcast by mid-January 2018 =WBTI simulcast= On August 31, 2018, WHLX started simulcasting WBTI. With WBTI simulcasting on WHLX, Liggett Communications has a WBTI on 3 frequencies as WHLX now has the translator W224DT transmitting on 92.7 in Port Huron. This has extended WBTI's reach from northern Lexington area down to Marine City/Algonac. =92.7 The Gift= On November 11, 2018, WHLX started airing a Christmas music format, branded as 92.7 The Gift, Port Huron's Christmas Station. =92.7 WHLX The Hills= On March 1, 2019, WHLX launched an adult album alternative/Americana format, branded as \\"92.7 The Hills\\".The Hills Are Alive in Port Huron Radioinsight - March 1, 2019 Technical WHLX covers the southern portion of St. Clair County and much of Macomb County, Michigan.

White was the Official Opposition Critic for a major overhaul of the Elections Act in late 1999. The only Official Opposition amendment to the Bill, C-2, permitted by the Minister at the time, the Hon. Don Boudria, was the insertion of Clause 18.1, which permitted Elections Canada to experiment with electronic voting methods. The provision had been pushed for by White throughout the Committee hearings, but was resisted by the Minister. Agreement for the insertion of the Clause was reached on the evening of December 1, 1999, during a telephone discussion between White and Boudria.

Not to be confused with the use of \\"phylactery\\" as synonym for tefillin, which are worn during prayer services by Orthodox Jewish men. to store the lich's soul. In some sources the method of becoming a lich is referred to as the Ritual of Becoming or Ceremony of Endless Night. The process is often described as requiring the creation and consumption of a deadly potion, the Elixir of Defilation, which is to be drunk on a full moon; although the exact details of the potion are described differently in various sources, the creation of the potion almost universally entails acts of utter evil, such as using as an ingredient the blood of an infant slain by the potential lich's own hand, or other, similarly vile components. The potion invariably kills the drinker but if the process is successful it rises again some days later as an undead Lich. Occasionally, this metamorphosis occurs by accident as a result of life-prolonging magic. Unlike most other forms of undead creatures, the Lich retains all of the memories, personality, and abilities that it possessed in life ‚Äî but it has a virtual eternity to hone its skills and inevitably becomes very powerful. Like other powerful forms of undead (such as a vampire or mummy), a Lich has unnatural powers owing to its state. For example, it can put mortals in a paralyzed state of hibernation with their minds, making them seem dead to others, and can, through its typically powerful magical spells, summon other lesser undead to protect it. A Lich's bones do not decay. The Lich is capable of sustaining tremendous physical damage, and is immune to disease, poison, fatigue and other effects that affect only the living. However, despite all its undead \\"gifts\\", a lich's most valuable resources are its vast intellect, its supreme mastery of sorcery and limitless time to research, plot and scheme. Since a lich's soul is mystically tied to its phylactery, destroying its body will not kill it. Rather, its soul will return to the phylactery, and its body will be recreated by the power keeping it immortal. Thus the only way to permanently destroy a lich is to destroy the phylactery as well. Therefore, the lich will generally be extremely protective of the priceless item. The phylactery, which can be of virtually any form (the default form is a metal box filled with rune-covered papers, but it usually appears as a valuable amulet or gemstone), will often be hidden in a secret place and protected by powerful spells, charms, monsters and/or other servants; the phylactery itself is usually of magical nature, meaning its destruction will generally be no easier than obtaining it. =Alignment= Depending on the method of becoming a lich, a lich can be of any alignment, retaining whatever alignment it had in life. The D&D; version 3.5 Monster Manual, a core D&D; rule book, emphatically states that liches are always evil, but there are references to good liches in other manuals. Good liches are presented in Monster Compendium: Monsters of Faer√ªn, a supplementary rule book for the D&D; 3rd edition rules. Good liches differ in that they have sought undeath for a noble cause, to protect a place, a loved one, or to pursue an important quest. In a typical D&D; campaign, liches are evil, power-hungry spell casters who have cheated death. The AD&D; Spelljammer accessory Lost Ships also introduced the good archlich, who are able to memorize spells through intuitive nature and do not need spellbooks. The archlich also does not become a demilich, but remains in its form for eternity. The fourth edition book Arcane Power includes the epic destiny archlich, which is intended for good, lawful good, or unaligned heroes. In the Forgotten Realms, arch-liches are liches from mortals who were divine casters of good alignment. Baelnorns are ancient elven liches who head noble families and aid communities through sage advice. While there are some records of these, they are extremely rare, and evil liches are far more prevalent. The abilities of good liches are somewhat diminished as well. Notable liches Liches are usually among the most powerful undead creatures in almost any setting in which they appear, and are one of the most powerful non-unique undead creatures in the D&D; game. =Deities= Several D&D; gods were liches before becoming deities; these gods include: *The drow goddess Kiaransalee, from the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. *Mellifleur the Lich-Lord: Non- campaign specific, this god was presented in Monster Mythology as the god of liches. *Vecna from the Greyhawk campaign setting. *Velsharoon, from the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. *The githyanki lich-queen Vlaakith CLVII has been attempting to attain godhood. *Erandis Vol, or Lady Vol to her worshippers, in the Eberron campaign setting. =Non-divine liches= * Acererak, of the World of Greyhawk campaign setting. * Arklem Greeth, Arcane Archmage of the Forgotten Realms setting. * Asberdies, resident of the sunken cave in module D1 Descent into the Depths of the Earth. * Aumvor the Undying appears in the Forgotten Realms book, Champions of Ruin (2005). * Azalin, the lord of Darkon in the Ravenloft campaign setting. * Boretti, Necromancer-King, ruler of a rogue army in Acheron, from Planescape: Planes of Law manual. * Dragotha, powerful dracolich in the World of Greyhawk campaign setting. * Dregoth, 3rd Champion of Rajaat, 'Ravager of Giants', Sorcerer-King of Giustenal in the Dark Sun campaign setting. * Harthoon, chief diplomat and castellan of Orcus (from the Book of Vile Darkness and Fiendish Codex I: Hordes of the Abyss). * Larloch the Last, last Netheril arcanist from the Forgotten Realms setting. * Skall, factol (leader) of the Dustmen faction in the Planescape setting. * Szass Tam, the de facto ruler of Thay in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. * Thessalar, of the World of Greyhawk campaign setting. Creator of the thessalmonster. * Redeye, the lich that rules over the Lizard Marsh. Appeared in the adventure module Under Illefarn. * Sammaster, First Speaker of the Cult of the Dragon in the Forgotten Realms setting. * Tordynnar Rhaevaern, baelnorn from the Forgotten Realms setting. * The Twisted Rune Lords: Jymahna, Kartak Spellseer, Priamon Rakesk, Rhangaun, Sapphiraktar the Azure (dracolich), and Shangalar the Black, all from the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. * Erandis Vol, nearly a deity. The driving force behind the Blood of Vol religion. Eberron campaign setting. * The Witch- King Zhengyi, from The Bloodstone Pass modules (particularly H4 Throne of Bloodstone) and the last two books of The Sellswords trilogy by R.A. Salvatore. * Zrie Prakis, subordinate and former lover of the wizard Cassana in the novel Azure Bonds. * Lup, Barry Bluejeans, Lydia, and Edward from the D&D; podcast The Adventure Zone. All portrayed by Griffin McElroy. =Notable liches in other Dungeons & Dragons related media= *Balpheron, a powerful lich who almost succeeded in conquering Toril, and who forms much of the backstory of Neverwinter Nights: Shadows of Undrentide. He makes a cameo appearance in Neverwinter Nights: Hordes of the Underdark. *Deimos, the final boss in Dungeons & Dragons: Tower of Doom. *Kangaxx, from Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn, a hidden quest battle. *Klaxx the Malign, from Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God. *Lyran, from Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II. *Karlat, a mage who sacrificed the children of Charwood Village to Belial the Fire Lord to gain lichdom in Neverwinter Nights. *Heurodis the Medusa sacrificed her eyes (and thus her Flesh-to-Stone Gaze) to become a lich in Neverwinter Nights: Shadows of Undrentide. The mythal empowering Undrentide served as her phylactery. *Vix'thra, the dracolich that was the final boss of the undead section of Neverwinter Nights: Hordes of the Underdark. *Rammaq, a titan turned demilich from Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer. *Vongoethe, from Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal. *Xykon, from The Order of the Stick. Variant liches =Demiliches= A demilich is an advanced form of lich that has sought other avenues to attain knowledge, turning away from the physical realm, using astral projection to travel across other planes of existence. Due to traveling across planes of existence, its body gradually deteriorates until only a skull or even a single skeletal hand remain. =Non- human liches= Other races also have their own special versions of the lich, which are not necessarily evil; for example, an Elf from the Forgotten Realms setting can become a baelnorn (often elves who take upon themselves the duty of overseeing and/or protecting their house), or an Illithid can become an illithilich, also known as an alhoon. A dragon can also become a dracolich. Dracoliches are greatly feared, for they are far more powerful than ordinary liches. A dracolich that became a demilich would be an extremely powerful monster, even by dragon standards. Lichfiends are evil outsiders that achieve lichdom. =Other variant liches= Other variant liches exist. Baneliches, extremely powerful priests of the Forgotten Realms deity Bane, grow in power every 100 years of their continued existence. Dry liches are desert-dwelling liches, the end result of the Walker in the Wastes prestige class. Psiliches are powerful users of psionic powers, who have used non-magical means to achieve this state of undeath. The Suel Imperium also had its own form of liches, the Suel lich‚Äîpowerful wizards who learned the secrets of transferring their souls from one body to the next‚Äîat the cost of the bodies burning out in brief periods. Reception Josh Hrala, for Geek & Sundry, reported that \\"liches really took off in modern gaming and fiction when D&D; co-creator Gary Gygax officially added it to the game back in 1975 in the supplement called Greyhawk. Gygax wasn‚Äôt the first person to conceive the idea of a lich, though. Instead, he lifted most of the idea from a short story from the late-1960s by fantasy author Gardner Fox\\". Rob Bricken from io9 named the lich as the 7th most memorable D&D; monster. In his review of the Monster Manual (2014), Henry Glasheen, for SLUG Magazine, wrote that \\"Fifth Edition has taken some of its most imposing creatures and given them an undeniable ambience\\" and highlighted the lich as an example monster that would use \\"her whole lair in a desperate attempt to annihilate the party\\". SyFy Wire in 2018 called it one of \\"The 9 Scariest, Most Unforgettable Monsters From Dungeons & Dragons\\", saying that \\"Liches are classic monsters not just in D&D;, but when you face one in the tabletop game you better be ready for a tough fight and more.\\" CBR in 2018 called it one of the \\"13 Most Powerful D&D; Monsters\\", saying that \\"they are immortal spellcasters who are almost impossible to kill seeing as you need to locate their Phylactery and destroy it. That's not something the Lich will just let a party do without some trouble, which makes a Lich one of the deadliest monsters in the game\\".  In popular culture  =Other publishers= * The lich is fully detailed in Paizo Publishing's book Undead Revisited (2011), on pages 22‚Äì27.Cagle, Eric, Brian Cortijo, Brandon Hodge, Steve Kenson, Hal Maclean, Colin McComb, Jason Nelson, Todd Stewart, and Russ Taylor. Undead Revisited (Paizo, 2011) * A lich appears in Judges Guild publications The Book of Ruins page 20, The Final Refuge of Allmark. * A lich is also the fate of one of the wizards among other forms of undead in Judges Guild module Citadel of Fire. *The Lich King is an Icon (a powerful NPC archetype) in 13th Age. = Television = * The animated television series Adventure Time \\"borrows heavily from the tabletop role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons [...] including monsters both minor (a gelatinous cube) and major (the Lich)\\".

The band was composed of Boston University students, singer John Lincoln Wright (September 23, 1947 - December 4, 2011), guitarist/singer Paul Tartachny, bassist/singer Wayne Ulaky, keyboardist Robert Rhodes and drummer Richard Weisberg . With the exception of a few rock standards, their diverse music was composed by members of the band, primarily Wright and Ulaky. The band's label, MGM Records promoted them as part of the so-called Bosstown Sound (along with the bands Ultimate Spinach and Orpheus), shepherded by the record producer Alan Lorber. The band met with little nationwide success. Their debut album, The Eyes of the Beacon Street Union, charted at number 75 on May 4, 1968. The band relocated to New York and recorded its second album, The Clown Died in Marvin Gardens. Wright, Ulaky, Weisberg, and Rhodes recorded another album, Come Under Nancy's Tent in 1970 under the name Eagle for Janus Records. On August 12, 1970, Beacon Street Union opened for Janis Joplin at Harvard Stadium, which was her last public performance before her death. In 1970, The Beacon Street Union recorded their final single \\"Lord Why Is it So Hard\\" / \\"Can‚Äôt Find My Fingers\\", adding Charlie Vatalaro on tenor sax.

The National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO) was an American activist organization that fought for the welfare rights of people, especially women and children. The organization had four goals: adequate income, dignity, justice, and democratic participation. The group was active from 1966 to 1975. At its peak in 1969, NWRO membership was estimated at 25,000 members (mostly African American women). Thousands more joined in NWRO protests. Roots In 1963 Johnnie Tillmon founded ANC (Aid to Needy Children) Mothers Anonymous, which was one of the first grassroots welfare mothers‚Äô organizations. This organization later became part of the National Welfare Rights Organization. In early 1966, delegates from poor peoples‚Äô organizations all over the country met in Syracuse, New York and Chicago, Illinois to discuss the need for unity among grassroots organizations for the poor in the United States. Around this same time, Richard Cloward and Frances Fox Piven, both of the Columbia University School of Social Work, were circulating a draft of an article called \\"The Weight of the Poor: A Strategy to End Poverty\\" that later appeared in The Nation. The article discussed the idea that the widespread distribution of information about welfare benefits eligibility could dramatically increase welfare rolls, thus creating a bureaucratic and fiscal crisis. In turn, this would lead to the replacement of public assistance programs that currently existed with a guaranteed annual income for all people. Cloward and Piven were more concerned with reaching community groups with this work than with academia, and the article helped to serve a link between the two.Bailis, L.: Bread or Justice: Grassroots Organizing in the Welfare Rights Movement, Page 7. Lexington Books, 1974 =George Wiley, CORE, PRAC, & the birth of a movement= In May 1966, George Wiley, a nationally recognized chemist, the second African American on the faculty of Syracuse University, and former associate director for the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and two of his associates from CORE set up the Poverty Rights Action Center (PRAC) in a two- story row house in Washington, D.C. The PRAC was intended to become a permanent headquarters for coordinating efforts of present poor people's organizations. The PRAC's first project was planning a series of demonstrations that were to be coordinated with a welfare recipients‚Äô march from Cleveland to Columbus, Ohio that had already been planned. This march had been thought up by representatives of the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee led by C√©sar Ch√°vez. The PRAC's efforts led to poverty rights demonstrations with thousands of participants in sixteen major cities on June 30, 1966, with extensive newspaper coverage in New York City, Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles, Baltimore, and Boston.Bailis, L.: Bread or Justice: Grassroots Organizing in the Welfare Rights Movement, Page 7-8. Lexington Books, 1974 Although there was no formal tie between the participating groups, the NWRO refers to the June 30 demonstrations as \\"the birth of a movement.\\" Broad coalitions of groups sponsored each city's activities, including, but not limited to, welfare recipient organizations. Over time, there was an increase in coordination and cooperation between these welfare recipient groups and thus a nationwide welfare recipients‚Äô organization was needed.Bailis, L.: Bread or Justice: Grassroots Organizing in the Welfare Rights Movement, Page 8. Lexington Books, 1974 =National coordinating committee formed= In August 1966, the representatives of welfare recipient groups from 24 cities met in Chicago, voting to form the National Coordinating Committee of Welfare Rights Groups (NCC). The PRAC office was officially named the headquarters for a welfare rights movement at a December 1966 meeting of the NCC. PRAC was authorized by the NCC in February 1967 to come up with a membership card for all groups affiliated with the NCC. Uniform membership requirements and a common dues structure for its affiliates were adopted by the NCC in April 1967. Early stages In August 1967, delegates from 67 local welfare rights organizations met in Washington, D.C. and adopted a constitution that was drafted by the PRAC staff and had been adopted by the NCC, thus forming the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO). Johnnie Tillmon became the first chair of the NWRO. The NCC made a place for itself within the NWRO as the main decision making body in the national structure of the organization. However, despite a nationwide organization, local welfare rights groups still retained nearly complete autonomy for their local actions. During the first few months of the new movement, the NWRO narrowed its focus from attempting to create a movement that would encompass all poor people to concentrating on those individuals who receive public assistance. Welfare recipients were easily organizable and they had the greatest measureable performance within the movement. Also in the early stages of the movement, Wiley rejected Cloward and Piven's strategy of flooding welfare rolls with new welfare recipients and instead favored a strategy of organizing current welfare recipients into pressure groups. Critics of the Cloward-Piven strategy argued that it was easier to create a welfare crisis than to bring about its resolution. Activists, who were mainly welfare recipients themselves with little political power, would be left amidst this crisis with the ability to do nothing about it. This move was also easier organizationally for the movement because it was strategically more difficult to identify those who were eligible for welfare than those who already received it, it was also more difficult to motivate welfare-eligible individuals to act than those who already received it, and it was easier to organize current recipients of welfare by offering them benefits such as supplementary welfare payments.Bailis, L.: Bread or Justice: Grassroots Organizing in the Welfare Rights Movement, Page 9. Lexington Books, 1974 Activity The NWRO's first major activity was lobbying against the work incentive provisions of the Social Security Amendments of 1967. The organization held demonstrations that included a sit-in at the United States Senate Committee on Finance hearing room. The activity brought the NWRO a lot of media attention but did not impact the shaping of legislation very heavily. In 1968, the NWRO was acknowledged by Martin Luther King, Jr., giving leaders of the movement and the issues at hand an important part in King's Poor People's Campaign. This nod from King helped to promote the NWRO's first meeting between its leadership and the United States Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare in the summer of 1968.Bailis, L.: Bread or Justice: Grassroots Organizing in the Welfare Rights Movement, Page 9-10. Lexington Books, 1974 In December 1968, the organization was granted a large government contract to help monitor the Work Incentive Program. Funding from this and several other large grants from foundations helped to finance a major expansion of the NWRO staff, including the addition of field organizers.Bailis, L.: Bread or Justice: Grassroots Organizing in the Welfare Rights Movement, Page 10. Lexington Books, 1974 The NWRO won much access to government officials during the first Nixon administration due to membership rolls growing larger and a bigger presence in the media. Leaders in the welfare rights movement were some of the first to be able to meet with Daniel P. Moynihan after he was appointed to the White House staff and leaders also started to meet regularly with Robert Finch, the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. During the drafting of the Family Assistance Plan, NWRO leaders were consulted by the Nixon administration and these leaders were also active in lobbying against the plan. Despite demonstrations pointed toward the United States Congress and the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and traditional lobbying and negotiating efforts, welfare rights activities were not mainly centered at the national level. The movement has relied much more on simultaneous demonstrations based on common ideas and themes from local affiliates across the United States. NWRO publications, such as its newspaper The Welfare Fighter, document accounts of the accomplishments and activities that local affiliates participated in.Kornbluh, F.: \\"To Fulfill Their ‚ÄòRightly Needs‚Äô: Consumerism and the National Welfare Rights Movement\\". Radical History Review, Page 81. Fall 1997 Local groups fueled much of the activity, such as the original June 30 rallies and \\"birthday in the streets\\" demonstrations each June 30 after that. Nationwide campaigns revolved around local groups demanding for resources such as supplemental welfare checks to pay for back- to-school clothing for children of welfare recipients as well as the demand for retail credit at major department stores for NWRO members.Bailis, L.:Bread or Justice: Grassroots Organizing in the Welfare Rights Movement, Page 10. Lexington Books, 1974 By August 1969, an NWRO convention in Detroit estimated roughly 20,000 dues paying members of the organization, and thus roughly 75,000 family members total affected by the movement.Bailis, L.:Bread or Justice: Grassroots Organizing in the Welfare Rights Movement, Page 11. Lexington Books, 1974 Most of the members of the movement were poor, mostly black women.West, G.: The National Welfare Rights Movement: The Social Protest of Poor Women, Page 3. Praeger, 1981 By 1971, NWRO included 540 separate welfare rights organizations. In 1972, Johnnie Tillmon was appointed executive director of the NWRO after George Wiley's resignation. Wiley had been trying to mobilize the working poor, whereas Tillmon tried to align with the feminist movement. Tillmon's 1972 essay, \\"Welfare Is a Woman's Issue,\\" which was published in Ms., emphasized women's right to adequate income, regardless of whether they worked in a factory or at home raising children.https://www.rapereliefshelter.bc.ca/learn/resources/welfare-womens- issue-johnnie-tillmon The funding for the NWRO had gone down by the time Tillmon became the executive director, and the NWRO ended in bankruptcy in March 1975; however, Tillmon continued fighting for welfare rights at the state and local levels. Organizational levels =Local level= Each local affiliate of the NWRO was fully autonomous. The group was allowed to decide on its own program, make its own decisions, organize itself, and raise money by itself, while the NWRO remained a resource for them. The only power the NWRO had over an affiliate was the power in which to recognize them as an affiliate. The national constitution required that members of local affiliates include a majority of welfare recipients and that all but ten percent of the members be people of low income. Each local group had to be independent of any larger organization that could restrict its freedom of action.Bailis, L.:Bread or Justice: Grassroots Organizing in the Welfare Rights Movement, Page 17.

A humanoid or monstrous humanoid creature can become a vampire, and looks as it did in life, with pale skin, haunting red eyes, and a feral cast to its features. A new vampire is created when another vampire drains the life out of a living creature. Its depiction is related to those in 1930s and 1940s Hollywood Dracula and monster movies. In writing vampires into the game, as with other creatures arising in folklore, the authors had to consider what elements arising in more recent popular culture should be incorporated into their description and characteristics.

Description A vampire can be of any evil alignment, and if its alignment was not evil in life it becomes so in undeath. A vampire retains all the abilities it had in life, plus it gains the ability to drain blood and life energy, and to dominate other creatures with its gaze. A vampire can also command rats, bats, and wolves, or take the form of those creatures. They also become superhumanly strong, can heal quickly or even regenerate, and can turn into a gaseous form. Some vampires worship the god Kanchelsis. Vampire spawn In the Dungeons and Dragons game, the vampire spawn are undead creatures created when a vampire slays a mortal with its bite. Vampire spawn look much the way they did in life (they are usually humanoids), except with hardened features and a predatory look. They also have greyer skin. Vampire spawn are similar in their habits to vampires, being evil creatures drawn to their graves and coffins. They are much more brutish, stupid and while still strong, are physically weaker than vampires. They cannot turn into a bat, dire bat, wolf, or dire wolf and they cannot summon rats, bats or wolves. Vampire spawn are unable to create spawn of their own. They attack by hammering opponents against walls, punching them, and tearing out their limbs. They can both energy drain, and suck the blood with a bite. Their mere gaze drains the victim of confidence, courage, energy, hope and joy. Vampire spawn have the ability to assume a gaseous form. They can also climb upon walls in the manner of a spider. Vampire spawn are, however, also vulnerable to all normal attacks and spells which repel vampires. Vampire spawn speak Common. They can be of any evil alignment. In the Dungeons & Dragons supplement Libris Mortis, vampire spawn, along with several other undead creatures became character classes for player characters.

The names of over two hundred and forty thousand people who lost their lives are inscribed on the memorial. Purpose was unveiled on 23 June 1995 in memory of the fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of Okinawa and the end of World War II. It was erected to: (1) Remember those lost in the war, and pray for perpetual peace; (2) Pass on the lessons of war; and (3) Serve as a place for meditation and learning. Name ‚Äì Political background Constructed by the administration of Masahide ≈åta, and as detailed in his book of the same name Okinawa: Heiwa no Ishiji, the name 'Cornerstone of Peace' alludes to the Japan-US security partnership. ≈åta writes 'It would not be an exaggeration to say that the motivation which led to the building of this 'Cornerstone of Peace' has also become the basis for the people of Okinawa devoting heart and soul, night and day, to solving the military base issue.' When US President Bill Clinton visited the Cornerstone of Peace in 2000 he delivered a speech promising efforts to reduce and consolidate US bases in Okinawa, as previously agreed by the US and Japanese governments. Design The main passage that extends to the 'fire of peace' The winning design, entitled 'Everlasting Waves of Peace', comprises concentric arcs of wavelike black granite stelai or screens. These are inscribed with the names of all those who died, regardless of nationality and civilian or military status. The names are in horizontal order from left to right, and in their native alphabet according to place of origin. The series totals some 116 stones, with the text running a total length of 2,200 metres. Inscription As of June 2015, there were 241,281 names. By order of inscription are 77,380 from other prefectures of Japan, by prefecture; 149,329 from Okinawa Prefecture, by hamlet; 14,009 from the USA, by unit; 82 from the UK; 365 from the Republic of Korea; 82 from North Korea; and 34 from Taiwan. The numbers correspond to recorded deaths during the Battle of Okinawa from the time of the US landings in the Kerama Islands on 26 March 1945 to the signing of the Japanese surrender on 2 September 1945, in addition to all Okinawan casualties in the Pacific War in the fifteen years from the Manchurian Incident, along with those who died in Okinawa from war-related events in the year before the battle and the year after the surrender. 234,183 names were inscribed by the time of unveiling and new names are added each year. Location Okinawa Prefectural Peace Park The site chosen for the memorial is Mabuni Hill in Itoman City, site of the Japanese headquarters and scene of heavy fighting in late June 1945 at the end of the Battle of Okinawa.

The Rise of the American Film Harcourt Brace, New York, 1930; p. 85 In the early 1900s, most motion picture patents were held by Thomas Edison's Motion Picture Patents Company in New Jersey, and filmmakers were often sued to stop their productions. To escape this, filmmakers began moving out west, where Edison's patents could not be enforced. Also, the weather was ideal and there was quick access to various settings.Mintz, S., and S.

That was until HJ Whitley decided he needed an industry for Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley cities he was building which included Reseda, Van Nuys and Canoga Park. He was able to convince David Horsley to settle in Hollywood. Horsley had created a camera that was not under Edison patent laws and was able to purchase film from the United Kingdom. The first film by a Hollywood studio, Nestor Motion Picture Company, was shot on October 26, 1911. The H. J. Whitley home was used as its set, and the unnamed movie was filmed in the middle of their groves at the corner of Whitley Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard.First Hollywood movie filmed on Whitley Estate on October 26, 1911 http://cinematreasures.org/blog/2010/7/7/first- hollywood-movie-filmed-on-whitley-estate-on-october-26-1911> One-hundred years of filmmaking in Hollywood (Thursday, October 27th, 2011) http://allanellenberger.com/tag/h-j-whitley/> The first studio in Hollywood, the Nestor Company, was established by the New Jersey‚Äìbased Centaur Company in a roadhouse at 6121 Sunset Boulevard (the corner of Gower), in October 1911.Robertson (2001), p. 21.

HJ Whitley was also able to convince four major film companies ‚Äì Paramount, Warner Bros., RKO, and Columbia ‚Äì to build studios in Hollywood. In the 1920s, Hollywood was the fifth-largest industry in the nation. Whitley Heights H. J. Whitley had a quest to make a very fine residential development on the hill of his share of the Hollywood property. He had to bring new ideas to create a development on the side of the hill in the fast changing times. H. J. Whitley commissioned architect A. S. Barnes to design Whitley Heights as a Mediterranean-style neighborhoods on the hillsides above Hollywood Boulevard. HJ sent Barnes to study the hill developments of Spain and Italy. By the 1920s all of Hollywood's brightest stars of the golden era lived there: Rudolph Valentino, W.C.

The city's approval of the Los Angeles aqueduct project in 1905, with a proposed terminus in the San Fernando Valley, inspired the formation of a land speculation syndicate: the Los Angeles Suburban Homes Company. Its partners included Whitley, as General Manager of the Los Angeles Suburban Homes Company, General H G Otis, General Manager and owner Los Angeles Times, General Moses Sherman, Pioneer Builder of Inter-Urban Electric Lines, O. F. Brandt, General Manager of Title Insurance & Trust Company and Harry Chandler, Vice President and assistant manager of the \\"Los Angeles Times,\\". The Los Angeles Suburban Homes Company syndicate purchased the parcel from the Los Angeles Farming and Milling Company, owned by Van Nuys and son-in-law Lankershim, in 1909. It comprised nearly the entire south half of the San Fernando Valley (south of present-day Roscoe Blvd.). The price was $2,500,000, or just under $53 an acre. In 1909 the Suburban Homes Company, a syndicate was formed and led by H. J. Whitley, general manager of the Board of Control, along with Harry Chandler, H. G. Otis, M. H. Sherman and O. F. Brandt.Mulholland, Catherine. The Owensmouth Baby - The Making of the San Fernando Valley Santa Susana Press, California, 1987; p. 18-20. Henry E. Huntington, extended his Pacific Electric Railway (Red Cars) through the Valley to Owensmouth (now Canoga Park). The Suburban Home Company laid out plans for roads and the towns of Van Nuys, Reseda (Marian) and Canoga Park (Owensmouth). The rural areas were annexed into the city of Los Angeles in 1915. On the land he planned the new towns of Van Nuys, Marian (present day Reseda), and Owensmouth (present day Canoga Park, Sherman Oaks, Tarzana, Woodland Hills and West Hills).Mulholland, Catherine.

Moses Sherman directed the project. After departing Van Nuys, the line's tracks ran in the middle of the syndicate's also new Sherman Way, a paved and landscaped \\"$500,000 boulevard.\\" Paved streets were unusual for rural 1911 L.A.; Sherman Way had no posted speed limit. The Janss Investment Company was the developer responsible for Van Nuys and Owensmouth, which brought losses later that Whitley bore. Whitley became president of three San Fernando Valley banks ‚Äî two were in new towns he had planned, Van Nuys and Owensmouth. Corcoran H. J. Whitley took the lead in building the city of Corcoran, California. He purchased to start the development and moved a member of his real estate firm, J. W. Guiberson, to the area. Whitley named all the city streets \\"avenues\\".

J. and Margaret Whitley traveled seventeen times to Europe, the Middle East and Asia for business and pleasure. After one trip, he brought back the coveted Egyptian cotton seed to be planted in Corcoran. He bought precious stones and jewelry to be sold in his Los Angeles City jewelry store, H.J.

Originally released in 1964 in Germany, then issued in 1967 in England, 1969 in Canada and finally in the United States in 1970. Recording history On 22 June 1961, composer and musical director Bert Kaempfert produced the group's first professional recording session backing English singer and guitarist Tony Sheridan for the German label Polydor. Performed in the auditorium of Friedrich-Ebert-Hall, a high school in the district of Hamburg- Harburg often used as a studio, Paul McCartney is on bass, John Lennon on rhythm guitar, Pete Best on drums (which only includes snare, hi-hats and cymbal) with George Harrison and Sheridan sharing lead guitar parts. McCartney, Lennon and Harrison also perform backing vocals. The session, which possibly ended the next day, saw the recording of \\"My Bonnie\\" and \\"The Saints\\" (released as a single that same year and on Sheridan's LP called My Bonnie in January 1962), \\"Why\\", an original song by Sheridan, and the covers \\"Nobody's Child\\" by Hank Snow and \\"If You Love Me, Baby (Take Out Some Insurance On Me, Baby)\\" by Jimmy Reed but the latter with different lyrics. Two other tracks on which Sheridan does not appear, the instrumental \\"Beatle Bop\\" (later renamed \\"Cry for a Shadow\\"), credited to Harrison - Lennon, and the standard \\"Ain't She Sweet\\", sung by Lennon, are also recorded. These five songs will remain unreleased for nearly three years.The Beatles: All These Years, Volume 1 ‚Äì Tune In, Mark Lewisohn, Harmony Books, 2013 \\"Sweet Georgia Brown\\" was recorded at Rahlstedt studio in Hamburg on 24 May, 1962, during a second recording session designed to end the Beatles recording contract with Polydor in order to give free rein to their new manager, Brian Epstein.

The western terminus of the route is at NY 28 and NY 169 in Middleville, Herkimer County. The eastern terminus of the route is at NY 22 just south of Salem, Washington County. NY 29 also serves the cities of Johnstown and Saratoga Springs and intersects four major north-south roadways: NY 10, NY 30, U.S. Route 9, and U.S. Route 4\\\\. When the NY 29 designation was created in the 1920s, the route extended from Barneveld in the west to Salem in the east. The Trenton-Middleville segment became part of an extended NY 28 in 1930. Since that time, the route has remained virtually unchanged, excluding minor realignments in Fulton County. Route description =Herkimer County= NY 29 begins at an intersection with NY 28 and NY 169 in Middleville, a small village situated on West Canada Creek in western Herkimer County. The route heads east, passing out of the village and into the towns of Fairfield and Salisbury, where NY 29 intersects NY 170 and NY 170A, respectively, on opposite sides of the town line. Approaching NY 170A on NY 29 westbound Past NY 170A, as well as the hamlet of Salisbury centered around the junction, NY 29 continues to Salisbury Center. In the center of the community, NY 29A, a northerly alternate to NY 29, splits off and heads east toward the southernmost reaches of Adirondack Park. NY 29, however, curves south, paralleling Spruce Creek to the village of Dolgeville, located on the Herkimer-Fulton County line. Within the village, NY 29 meets NY 167 prior to crossing over the East Canada Creek (and entering Fulton County) and leaving Dolgeville. =Fulton County= Once in Fulton County, NY 29 turns southeast as it heads through Oppenheim. In the hamlet of Oppenheim, located midway between the limits of Dolgeville and Ephratah, the route meets the northern end of the short NY 331, a route leading to the hamlet of Crum Creek to the south. Farther east, NY 29 begins to turn to the east as it passes into Ephratah. Although only of NY 29 is located within the town, the route overlaps NY 10, a major north-south route, for roughly near the eastern town line prior to entering the town of Johnstown. Just across the town line, NY 29 intersects NY 10A, an alternate route of NY 10 around both the Ephratah hamlet of Rockwood and nearby Rockwood Lake. NY 29 continues on, passing north of the Cork Center Reservoir and south of the smaller Cold Brook Reservoir before entering the city of Johnstown as West State Street. At Green Street, NY 29 bears right on William Street, then joins with NY 67 at East Main Street. After crossing downtown, the concurrency ends with NY 67 following East State Street toward Amsterdam. NY 29 then reaches Comrie Avenue, turning left to join with NY 30A briefly to an intersection with Briggs Street, a westward extension of the major business section of that stretch of Comrie Avenue. NY 29 turns east here to leave the city; however, west of NY 30A, Briggs Street is state-maintained as well as NY 920C (an unsigned reference route) for an additional to where the street crosses a tributary of Hale Creek. This portion of the street is generally wider than that of the city-maintained portion. Several businesses are accessed on both sides, as well as a side entrance to the nearby Johnstown Arterial Plaza. The Jansen Avenue Elementary School playground is also along this route. East of Johnstown, NY 29 heads northeast, intersecting Steele Avenue Extension (unsigned NY 920J and the former eastern terminus of NY 29A) just west of the Mayfield town line. NY 29 continues into Mayfield, meeting both the current eastern terminus of NY 29A and NY 30 in the vicinity of the hamlet of Vail Mills. Past Mayfield, NY 29 passes through both the village and town of Broadalbin before crossing into Saratoga County. Washington Street, Saratoga Springs =Saratoga and Washington counties= For its first few miles in Saratoga County, NY 29 roughly parallels the Galway-Providence town line as it heads eastward through a largely rural area of the county. Upon crossing into Milton, the route initially curves south to serve the hamlet of Rock City Falls before resuming an easterly track south of the Milton-Greenfield town line into the Saratoga Springs city limits. At first, the land surrounding NY 29 is largely undeveloped; however, the amount of open space rapidly declines as the route continues toward the city center. Once in the core of the city, NY 29 becomes Washington Street and continues east for several blocks to Broadway, here carrying U.S. Route 9 and NY 50\\\\. NY 29 turns north, overlapping both routes to Church Street. Here, both NY 9N and the concurrency between US 9, NY 29, and NY 50 terminate, with NY 29 continuing east from the intersection as the \\"General Philip Schuyler Memorial Highway\\", named for Philip Schuyler, a general in the American Revolution. Just outside the city center, NY 29 passes under Interstate 87 with no access; the missing connection is made via NY 9P a short distance to the south. The memorial designation stays with NY 29 as it exits Saratoga Springs and parallels Fish Creek to Schuylerville, where it intersects U.S. Route 4 and NY 32\\\\. Here, the highway name comes to an end; however, NY 29 continues on, overlapping US 4 and NY 32 south for two blocks to Ferry Street. NY 29 then follows Ferry Street out of the village and across the Hudson River on the Schuylerville Bridge into Washington County. Near the village of Greenwich in the town of the same name, NY 29 briefly overlaps NY 40 across the Batten Kill before splitting north of the river and entering the village as Main Street. The route retains the name up to Salem Street, at which point NY 29 turns east onto Salem while Main becomes NY 372\\\\. NY 29 exits the village of Greenwich soon after and begins to parallel the northern bank of the Batten Kill as it heads northeastward through the town of Greenwich. Near the hamlet of East Greenwich, the path of the route and of the river becomes more easterly as NY 29 intersects County Route 49 (CR 49), once the southeastern terminus of NY 338\\\\. From East Greenwich, NY 29 and the Batten Kill cross into Salem, where NY 29 comes to an end at NY 22 south of the village of Salem. History In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route 26, an unsigned legislative route that extended from Little Falls to Barneveld via Dolgeville and Salisbury. Also created at this time was Route 37, which ran from Johnstown to Ballston Spa via Galway. Route 26 roughly followed what is now NY 29 from Dolgeville west to Fairfield while Route 37 utilized the NY 29 corridor from Johnstown to the modern junction with NY 147 at Kimball Corners. In 1910, Route 26 was reconfigured to begin in Mohawk and follow what is now NY 169 and NY 28 between Little Falls and Barneveld. Route 37, meanwhile, was altered twice by 1912 to begin in Dolgeville and follow modern NY 29 east to Johnstown. East of Johnstown, it was tentatively routed on Fulton County's CR 107 and current NY 30 to Broadalbin, where Route 37 rejoined the path of modern NY 29 and followed it east to Saratoga Springs. Much of what is now NY 29 east of Saratoga Springs was included in the legislative route system during the 1910s. In 1911, the portion of modern NY 29 west of the Hudson River in Schuylerville was designated as part of Route 43, a new route that extended south from Schuylerville to Stillwater. The segment of current NY 29 between Saratoga Springs and Grange Hall Road west of Schuylerville became part of Route 25 by 1920. On March 1, 1921, Routes 25, 37, and 43 were reconfigured as part of a partial renumbering of New York's legislative route system. Route 37 was extended southwest to Little Falls over Route 26's original alignment and realigned between Johnstown and Broadalbin to use the path of modern NY 29\\\\. Route 43, meanwhile, was renumbered to Route 44 and extended west to Saratoga Springs over Route 25, which was altered to use current U.S. Route 9 from Glens Falls to Saratoga Springs. NY 29 was assigned in the mid-1920s, utilizing the routing of legislative Route 37 from Dolgeville to Saratoga Springs, the alignment of Route 44 between Saratoga Springs and Schuylerville, and the original routing of Route 26 between Fairfield and Dolgeville. The route also extended farther out in both directions as it initially began in Barneveld and ended south of Salem. In between Barneveld and Fairfield, NY 29 passed through Poland and Middleville. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the segment of NY 29 between Barneveld and Middleville became part of an extended NY 28 while NY 29 was truncated southeastward to Middleville. East of Johnstown, NY 29 originally zig-zagged across its current route. Some of the old alignments remain as side roads or access routes, including Schoolhouse Road, Schabacker Road, and Circle Road in the town of Johnstown. The old route also followed current Fulton County Route 155 through Vail Mills, where it overlaps briefly with NY 30 and continues into the village of Broadalbin. In Broadalbin, original NY 29 entered as West Main Street, turning right onto Mill Street, then left on Saratoga Avenue, leaving the village and meeting the current routing. East of Broadalbin, other original alignments included Stevers Mill Roads, Mueller Road, and Old State Road. The current alignment between Broadalbin and the Saratoga County line was built in the early 1950s while the bypass around Vail Mills and Broadalbin was completed . Major intersections NY 29A right NY 29A () is an alternate route of NY 29 between Salisbury and Broadalbin, accessing Gloversville. It was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.

Unlike his earlier records, this (and the subsequent Final Exam) saw Wainwright adopt a full blown rock band (Slowtrain) - though there are acoustic songs on T Shirt, including a talking blues. Nevertheless, it had the misfortune to arrive on the scene at the same time as punk rock, making it immediately dated in the eyes of many critics. According to Wainwright on the 2006 CD liner notes, it received a scathing review from Rolling Stone which depressed him so much he stayed in bed for five days. By the early 1990s, he disowned the album in a radio interview broadcast in Australia. However, by the time of the CD remaster (which included Final Exam) he admitted to a much more sympathetic view of the album(s), which he referred to as his 'puppies'.

The 2006 NRL season was the first season where Friend played regular first grade football. Out of Melbourne's 29 matches in 2006, Friend played in 21 of the games including all three of the Storm's finals series matches. Friend only lost two games out of the 21 he played in 2006. He played in the 2006 NRL Grand Final for Melbourne as one of their interchange players. Melbourne lost the match 15-8 to his former club the Brisbane Broncos at Telstra Stadium. In 2007, Friend played on the interchange bench in the Titans' inaugural game, a 20-18 home loss to the St George Illawarra Dragons. He continued to play on the bench for the first eight games of the season. In Round 9, he replaced Clint Amos as the Titans' starting hooker and remained first choice hooker for the rest of the season. The Titans' Round 20 loss to the South Sydney Rabbitohs was the only game in the 2007 season that Friend did not play in. Friend playing for the Titans in 2008 In 2008, Friend remained first choice hooker for the Titans. He scored his first ever try in first grade in the Titans' 30-12 away loss to the St George Illawarra Dragons in Round 2. The 2009 NRL season was Friend's best year in the NRL. He played as starting hooker in all of the club's matches in 2009 as the Gold Coast reached the finals for the first time, finishing in third place. He scored more tries in 2009 than he did in the rest of his NRL career, scoring four. Their season ended in disappointment with the Titans losing both of their finals games to the Brisbane Broncos and Parramatta Eels respectively. Friend won the Paul Broughton Medal for the Gold Coast Titans' player of the year in 2009. In 2010, Friend again played in all of the Titans' games in that season. This meant that he had played 56 consecutive games for the Gold Coast Titans. Friend was also given an opportunity to play State of Origin due to an injury to first choice hooker Cameron Smith before game one. Friend was up against other Queensland hookers such as Matt Ballin, Andrew McCullough, Jake Friend, Kevin Kingston and Aaron Payne. Matt Ballin was selected ahead of Friend, mainly due to his age. The Gold Coast had a slow start to the 2011 season, losing all of their first three games. Friend was injured and unable to play in all of these games and many attribute the losses to the fact that Friend was absent and his replacement Riley Brown did not have the same impact as Friend. His injury also meant that his run of 56 consecutive matches for the Titans came to an end. At the end of the 2011 NRL season, the Gold Coast finished last on the table and claimed their first wooden spoon. On 11 April 2011, Friend signed with New Zealand Warriors for the 2012 and 2013 seasons with an option for 2014.Friend says first priority is Titans goldcoast.com.au, 12 April 2011 In August 2013 the Warriors took up the option for 2014 and in May 2014 his persistent tackling saw them extending his stay at the Warriors by a further year, for the 2015 season. In round 18 2015, in the Warriors' last victory of the season, against the Melbourne Storm, Friend was a key player in one of the best tries of the season. He was upended and displayed his best acrobatic moves after chasing a Chad Townsend bomb kick, delivering a jaw-dropping back flip pass between his legs to Sam Tomkins. YouTube link. On 30 July 2015, after four years with the Warriors, Friend signed a 1-year contract to return to the Gold Coast, starting in 2016.http://www.zerotackle.com/nrl/titans-reunite-with-an-old-friend-18416/ Post playing Friend retired at the end of the 2016 NRL season and now works as a Bricklayer.

Completed in 2000, it includes the new Hayden Planetarium, the original of which was opened in 1935 and closed in 1997. Neil deGrasse Tyson is its first and, , only director. History Hayden Planetarium, circa 1935‚Äì45 The center is an extensive reworking of the former Hayden Planetarium, whose first projector, dedicated in 1935, had 2 successors previous to the current one. The original Hayden Planetarium was founded in 1933 with a donation by philanthropist Charles Hayden. In 1935, the Hayden Planetarium, designed by architects Trowbridge & Livingston, opened, after its construction was funded by a $650,000 loan from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and a $150,000 donation from banker Charles Hayden of Hayden, Stone & Co. Its mission was to give the public \\"a more lively and sincere appreciation of the magnitude of the universe... and for the wonderful things which are daily occurring in the universe.\\" Joseph M. Chamberlain, hired as an assistant curator in 1952, became Chairman of the Planetarium in 1956. In 1960, a Zeiss Mark IV projector was installed, followed by a Zeiss Mark VI projector and new seats in 1993. In January 1997, the original Hayden Planetarium was closed and demolished. In August 1999, a new, customized Zeiss Mark IX projector was installed, accompanied by a digital dome projection system that provides a 3-D visualization of the universe based on images generated in real time by a Silicon Graphics supercomputer. On February 19, 2000, the $210 million Frederick Phineas and Sandra Priest Rose Center for Earth and Space, containing the new Hayden Planetarium, opened to the public. The Rose Center is named after two members of the Rose family, and was designed by James Polshek and Todd H. Schliemann of Polshek Partnership Architects with the exhibition design by Ralph Appelbaum Associates. The Museum's garden was designed by Seattle based landscape architecture firm Gustafson, Guthrie, Nichol. Tom Hanks provided the voice-over for the first planetarium show during the opening of the new Rose Center for Earth & Space in the Hayden Planetarium in 2000. Since then such celebrities as Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Redford, Harrison Ford, Liam Neeson and Maya Angelou have been featured. Design Back to front: the Hayden Sphere, the Heilbrun Cosmic Pathway, and the Scales of the Universe exhibit. Close-up of the Scales of the Universe exhibit. Hayden Sphere at night. The Hayden Sphere with the winding Cosmic Pathway helix. Designed by Polshek and Todd Schliemann, the building consists of a six-story high glass cube enclosing the illuminated Hayden Sphere, which appears to float, although it is actually supported by truss work. Polshek has referred to this work as a \\"cosmic cathedral\\". The Rose Center and its adjacent plaza are both located on the north face of the Museum; the Center encloses of research, education, and exhibition spaces, in addition to the Hayden Planetarium. Also located in the facility is the Department of Astrophysics, the newest academic research department in the Museum. Furthermore, Polshek designed the Weston Pavilion, a high transparent structure of \\"water white\\" glass along the Museum's west facade. This structure, a small companion piece to the Rose Center, offers a new entry way to the Museum, as well as opening further exhibition space for astronomically- related objects. The planetarium's original magazine, The Sky, merged with another journal, The Telescope, to become the leading astronomy magazine Sky & Telescope.http://www.amnh.org/science/facilities/hayden.php =Exclusion of Pluto as a Planet= The exhibits highlight human connection to the cosmos along with the scale and properties of the observable universe itself. The new Rose Center opened on 19 February 2000 with a model of only eight planets, excluding Pluto, when there has not been a scientific consensus whether it is a planet or not, and much of the American public thought of it as the ninth planet. On 22 January 2001, almost a year later, the New York Times reported it on its front page and led to much media attention and public controversy. Later this article is compiled into =Hayden Planetarium= The Hayden Planetarium (often called \\"The Hayden Sphere\\" or \\"The Great Sphere\\") has, since 2000, been one of the two main attractions within the Rose Center. It was established by the State of New York in 1933, some of the funding coming from philanthropist Charles Hayden. Accessed 2008-02-19 The top half of the Hayden Sphere houses the Star Theater, which uses high-resolution fulldome video to project ‚Äúspace shows‚Äù based on scientific visualization of current astrophysical data, in addition to a customized Zeiss Star Projector system replicating an accurate night sky as seen from Earth. The Big Bang Theater occupies the bottom half of the Hayden Sphere. Utilizing a screen that measures in diameter over an bowl, a four-minute program depicts the birth of the universe, with narration by Liam Neeson. The Big Bang Theater serves as an introduction to the Heilbrun Cosmic Pathway, a spiral which wraps around the sphere, connecting the second and first floors of the Rose Center. The cosmic pathway provides a timeline of the universe's history from the Big Bang to the present day. The Heilbrun Cosmic Pathway is one of the most popular exhibits in the Rose Center, which opened February 19, 2000. The Hayden Planetarium offers a number of courses and public presentations including the Frontiers of Astrophysics and Distinguished Authors lecture series. =Arthur Ross Terrace= The Ross Terrace adjacent to the Rose Center for Earth and Space, and built over the new parking garage on 81st Street. This rooftop plaza is designed to be a stage set that celebrates both astronomy and Earth‚Äôs natural history, as well as an outdoor gathering place for museum visitors. Renowned landscape architect Kathryn Gustafson formed the concept for the Terrace after seeing an illustration of shadows cast by a lunar eclipse. A terrace covering was designed by Charles Morris Anderson as a Landscape Architect, and his design was awarded the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) Design award in 2003. Current exhibits and shows , five shows have premiered in the theater. The first show, Passport to the Universe, opened with the new theater and features the voice of Tom Hanks as a guide along a voyage from Earth to the edge of the observable universe. The Search for Life: Are We Alone? debuted in 2002, with narration by Harrison Ford describing the possibilities of extraterrestrial life. Opened in 2006 and narrated by Robert Redford, Cosmic Collisions examines the role that impacts have played in shaping the universe‚Äîincluding visualizations of Earth's magnetosphere, the formation of the Moon, and the meteorite impact that contributed to the end of the age of dinosaurs. Journey to the Stars, narrated by Whoopi Goldberg, premiered on, July 4, 2009, featuring extraordinary images from telescopes on the ground and in space and stunning, never-before-seen visualizations of physics-based simulations. Dark Universe, narrated by Neil deGrasse Tyson, premiered on November 2, 2013. Other exhibits can be found outside the sphere. The Gottesman Hall of the Planet Earth has displays that illustrate the Earth's geological history and weather patterns. The Cullman Hall of the Universe focuses on topics ranging from planets to stars, life on other worlds to current cosmology. The Scales of the Universe exhibit makes comparisons between the size of the Hayden Sphere and other objects in the universe presented at appropriate relative scale. There is also a photographic exhibit about the Apollo moon landings. The photographs are throughout the first floor level of the Rose Center.

The brigs Rescue and , specially reinforced and fitted out for Arctic service, were offered on loan to the U.S. Government by Henry Grinnell in 1850 for use in a rescue mission tracing the ill-fated expedition which, in May 1845, had sailed from England under Sir John Franklin seeking a northwest passage. Two years later the Admiralty dispatched relief expeditions. Since there was still no news of the expedition by 1 May 1850, the U.S. Congress authorized the President to accept Mr. Grinnell's offer. In accordance with the wishes of both Congress and Mr. Grinnell, both ships were manned by volunteers from the U.S. Navy. On 22 May, the expedition, commanded by Lt. Edwin De Haven, sailed from New York with Rescue's captain, Acting Master Samuel P. Griffin, second in command. Sailing independently the first days out, the two ships rendezvoused at the Whalefish Islands in Disko Bay, Greenland, and on 29 June headed for Melville Bay and the northern route across Baffin Bay to Lancaster Sound. On 1 July they encountered their first pack ice off Har√∂e Island. On the 8th, they were caught in the ice north of Upernavik and spent the next 21 days forcing their way through the ice. Free on the 29th, the brigs continued through the heavy floes of Melville Bay into August. On the 19th, they entered Lancaster Sound. By the 23d, Rescue was off Cape Riley, Devon Island. There, Griffin and others from his crew joined searchers from a British squadron in the discovery of a campsite previously occupied by an unknown Royal Navy party. On the 26th, the American expedition attempted to enter Wellington Channel and search to the north of Cape Spencer. Meeting another British ship, they learned that positive evidence of the Franklin party had been found between the Cape and Point Innes. Ice, however, blocked further progress to the north, through the channel, and to the west, into Barrow Strait. On the 27th, the search vessels, British and American, gathered in a cove, later named Union Bay, at Beechey Island to plan coordinated searches. As the commanders made their plans, a shore party discovered three graves on the island, across from Cape Riley. Franklin's first winter quarters had been found. From that time on, however, little progress was made in the search, even though sledge parties were sent out. One such party, from Rescue, followed traces of a similar journey by a party from one of Franklin's ships, or , almost to Cape Bowden. Continuing past that point, they discovered a bay which now bears Griffin's name. During early September further attempts were made to penetrate the ice barrier to the west. On the 12th, Rescue's rudder post was split in a storm off Griffith's Island, and on the 13th the two ships, Advance towing Rescue, turned east in hopes of returning to the United States that season. On the 14th, however, they were caught, frozen, midway across the entrance to Wellington Channel. A winter of drifting began. During September and October they drifted in the Wellington Channel, discovering in the process the northern peninsula of Devon Island which they named after Grinnell. In November they oscillated with the winds and currents near Beechey, and in December they drifted down Lancaster Sound. On 14 January 1851, they were carried into Baffin Bay. At the end of May, their imprisoning floe neared Davis Strait, and on 5 June, the ice began to break up. Rescue, repaired, parted company with Advance. On the 7th, she was free. On the 8th, Advance cleared the ice. Both ships replenished in Disko Bay and into August attempted to renew their search. But the ice was heavier than the previous year, and neither ships nor men could have lasted through another winter. Scurvy had struck, but no one had died. A second winter in northern Baffin Bay would have brought a return of the disease and disaster. The ships turned south. Advance reached New York 30 September 1851. Rescue followed her into port on 7 October. Both ships were subsequently returned to Mr. Grinnell, and Advance was prepared for a second Arctic expedition. The Rescue was later sold and became the schooner Amaret, tender to the barque George Henry at the time Charles Francis Hall went to the Arctic on his first expedition in 1860. Amaret was driven ashore in a gale at Holsteinborg Harbour, Greenland on 27 September 1860, and became a total wreck.Hall, Charles Francis, Arctic Researches and Life Amongst the Esquimaux, New York, Harper & Brothers, 1865 References Category:Brigs of the United States Navy Category:Arctic exploration vessels ","title":"USS Rescue (1850)"},{"id":"5632644","text":"Breadalbane ( ) is a municipality that holds community status in Prince Edward Island, Canada.

The town was important as a local centre in the late 19th century. Several mills operated there, with the dam dismantled early in the 21st century. Breadalbane has a community centre and a library and was the first station east of Emerald Junction on the Prince Edward Island Railway before the railroad was dismantled.  Political history  James Kennedy, a Conservative, was first elected to the PEI Legislative Assembly in the general election of 1908 for 4th Prince. He was re-elected in the general election of 1912. Kennedy died while in office. Kennedy's brother Murdoch was also a MLA. The two brothers served concurrently from 1908 to 1915. Kennedy operated a general store and was a large exporter of farm produce. James Kennedy dies 23 April 1915 Murdoch Kennedy was born 25 March 1873 in Breadalbane. He married Margaret Davison Biggar and they had five children, Maude, Ray, Hazel, Erma and Ivan. He was first elected to the Legislative Assembly in a by-election on 19 December 1906 for 1st Queens. He was re-elected in the general elections of 1908, 1912, 1915, 1919, and 1923. In 1913, he resigned his Cabinet position because he disagreed with the government's support for the use of automobiles on public roads.http://www.gov.pe.ca/photos/original/leg_mthbiosK.pdf  Notable people  Though a small community, with a population of less than 200, Breadalbane is home to several prominent political and cultural figures.

Berwick Falls In April 1318, Berwick-upon-Tweed, the last Scottish stronghold which was in the hands of the English, was captured by Sir James Douglas and Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray, two of King Robert Bruce's most able commanders. Ever since his defeat at Bannockburn in 1314, Edward II had been preoccupied by an ongoing political struggle with his senior barons, headed by Thomas, Earl of Lancaster. Repeated Scottish raids deep into the north of England had effectively been ignored: but the loss of Berwick was something different. Once the most important port in Scotland, it had been in English hands since 1296; during which time its defences had been greatly strengthened. News of its capture had a sobering effect on Edward and his magnates. Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, managed to arrange a temporary reconciliation between the king and Lancaster. In a spirit of artificial harmony, they came north together with a sizeable army in the summer of 1319. Queen Isabella accompanied the king as far as York, where she took up residence. Vigorous assaults were made on Berwick by land and sea, but Walter, the High Stewart of Scotland, ably assisted by John Crabb, a military engineer, conducted an effective defence, beating back all attacks. However, he could not be expected to hold out indefinitely. King Robert had no intention of risking a direct attack on the powerful English army which, in the words of John Barbour, 'might well turn to folly'. Instead, Douglas and Moray were ordered on yet another large-scale diversionary raid into Yorkshire, intended to draw off the besiegers. They came with a large force of mounted infantry, known as hobelars. The Chapter of Myton The Scots seemingly had news of the queen's whereabouts, and the rumour soon spread that one of the aims of their raid was to take her captive. As King Robert advanced towards York, she was hurriedly taken out of the city by water, finally gaining refuge further south in Nottingham. Yorkshire itself was virtually undefended and the raiders had an uninterrupted passage from place to place. William Melton, the Archbishop of York, set about mustering an army, which included a large number of men in holy orders. While the force was led by some men of standing, including John Hotham, Chancellor of England, and Nicholas Fleming, Mayor of York, it had very few men-at-arms or professional fighting men.Foard (2003) p.5 From the gates of York, Melton's host marched out to face the battle-hardened schiltrons, some east of Boroughbridge, where the rivers Swale and Ure meet at Myton. The outcome is described in the Brut or the Chronicles of England, the fullest contemporary source for the battle; Many men were pressed into service who were not trained soldiers, including those who were monks and choristers from the cathedral in York. As so many clerics were slain in the encounter, it also became known as the 'Chapter of Myton'. Barbour gives the English loss as 1,000 killed, including 300 priests, but the contemporary English Lanercost Chronicle says that 4,000 Englishmen were killed by the Scots, while another 1,000 were drowned in the River Swale. Nicholas Fleming was among those killed.Foard (2003), p.8  The King Departs  The Chapter of Myton had the effect that Bruce was looking for. At Berwick it caused a serious split in the army between those like the king and the southerners, who wished to continue the siege, and those like Lancaster and the northerners, who were anxious about their homes and property. Edward's army effectively split apart: Lancaster refused to remain and the siege had to be abandoned. The campaign had been another fiasco, leaving England more divided than ever. It was widely rumoured that Lancaster was guilty of treason, as the raiders appeared to exempt his lands from destruction. Hugh Despenser, the king's new favourite, even alleged that it was Lancaster who had told the Scots of the queen's presence in York. To make matters worse, no sooner had the royal army disbanded than Douglas came back over the border and carried out a destructive raid into Cumberland and Westmorland. Edward had little choice but to ask Robert for a truce, which was granted shortly before Christmas. References = Sources = * Anonimale Chronicle, ed. V. H.

The class automorphisms form a subgroup of the automorphism group. Some facts: * Every inner automorphism is a class automorphism. * Every class automorphism is a family automorphism and a quotientable automorphism. * Under a quotient map, class automorphisms go to class automorphisms. * Every class automorphism is an IA automorphism, that is, it acts as identity on the Abelianization. * Every class automorphism is a center-fixing automorphism, that is, it fixes all points in the center. * Normal subgroups are characterized as subgroups invariant under class automorphisms. For infinite groups, an example of a class automorphism that is not inner is the following: take the finitary symmetric group on countably many elements and consider conjugation by an infinitary permutation. This conjugation defines an outer automorphism on the group of finitary permutations. However, for any specific finitary permutation, we can find a finitary permutation whose conjugation has the same effect as this infinitary permutation. This is essentially because the infinitary permutation takes permutations of finite supports to permutations of finite support. For finite groups, the classical example is a group of order 32 obtained as the semidirect product of the cyclic ring on 8 elements, by its group of units acting via multiplication. Finding a class automorphism in the stability group that is not inner boils down to finding a cocycle for the action that is locally a coboundary but is not a global coboundary.

These riots are remembered as a turning point in Puerto Rican civic involvement in Chicago. This was the first riot in the United States attributed to Puerto Ricans. History and cause Puerto Rican migration to Chicago peaked in the 1950s and 60s, and the Puerto Rican population of Chicago jumped from 255 in 1950 to 32,371 in 1960. Puerto Ricans in Chicago worked low-paying jobs in the service industries or labored in factories. This was in part because of the recruitment efforts of Castle, Barton and Associates, an employment agency. They offered domestic and foundry work contracts, and paid the airfare for Puerto Ricans coming to Chicago. Another factor behind Puerto Rican migration to Chicago was the unemployment and harsh economic conditions created by Operation Bootstrap. Some of the new Puerto Rican arrivals settled in Chicago's north side, specifically in Lincoln Park. But by the late 1960s, gentrification took hold in Lincoln Park, and working class Puerto Ricans were displaced by high property taxes and expensive housing. Around the city, some Puerto Ricans faced housing discrimination based on their skin color and ethnicity. Many moved west, settling near Division Street in West Town, Bucktown, and Wicker Park.Cruz, Wilfredo (2004). Puerto Rican Chicago. Arcadia Publishing. p. 31. The Chicago Catholic Church did not offer the Puerto Rican community their own parish, so devout Puerto Ricans had to try to attend existing parishes. In the 1950s and 60s, some white parishes did not accept Puerto Rican parishioners, so Puerto Ricans were displaced, looking for a place to worship and meet.Cruz, Wilfredo (2004). Puerto Rican Chicago. Arcadia Publishing. p. 51. According to Felix M. Padilla, the systematic oppression that Puerto Ricans experienced in Chicago in the 1960s created a psychological climate for riot. Puerto Ricans faced racial discrimination, class-related hardships, and lived on the margins of a city that only valued them for their cheap labor.Padilla, Felix M. (1987). Puerto Rican Chicago. University of Notre Dame Press. p. 150-153. Puerto Ricans in Chicago carried deep feelings of resentment towards the police. Puerto Ricans associated the police with poor service of the community and brutal, rude interactions. Despite these tense conditions, police superintendent Orlando W. Wilson reported that the police report on racial tensions he ordered on June 7 showed no signs of unrest in the Puerto Rican community.Padilla, Felix M. (1987). Puerto Rican Chicago. University of Notre Dame Press. p. 147-149.  Riots  In 1966, Chicago mayor Richard J. Daley declared the first week of June to be \\"Puerto Rican Week.\\" On June 12, 1966, Puerto Ricans celebrated the culmination of this week, and their first ethnic parade in downtown Chicago, held on June 11. In the evening, on Division Street in West Town and Humboldt Park, an altercation began between police and revelers near Damen Avenue and Division Street. Police alleged that Arcelis Cruz, a young Puerto Rican man, was armed and involved in a street fight. A white police officer,Padilla, Felix M. (1987). Puerto Rican Chicago. University of Notre Dame Press. p. 145-146. Thomas Munyon, shot Cruz in the leg. A large crowd gathered, and bystanders became involved. Some gathered to try to help Cruz, others to demonstrate against police violence. More police were called, with canine units. A police officer let a police dog bite a Puerto Rican man on the leg. The crowd of over 4,000 Puerto Ricans attacked the police with rocks, bottles, and cans, and smashed windows on police cars. The crowd overturned some police cars, and set fire to others. More police and canine units were called in, but the rioting continued for three days. As the riot began, a local Spanish-language radio personality, Carlos Agrelot, was broadcasting live, describing the scene on Division Street. His coverage of the violence and protest attracted more people to the streets, even people from other neighborhoods.Fernandez, Lilia. Brown in the Windy City. University of Chicago Press, 2012. p. 163-65. On the second day of the riot, community organization leaders and clergymen organized a rally. At this rally, organizers urged the crowd of 3,000 Puerto Ricans to end the violence. The police department also ordered officers to de-escalate the conflict. However, after the rally, rioters threw bricks and rocks at police officers, and the riot continued. Rioters targeted white-owned businesses as they looted and burned property in the neighborhood. On the third night, 500 police officers patrolled the Division Street area, attempting to suppress the uprising. Over the course of the three nights of the riot, 16 people were injured, 49 were arrested, and 50 buildings were critically damaged.Cruz, Wilfredo (2004). Puerto Rican Chicago. Arcadia Publishing. p. 91. Aftermath Following the riot, community leaders organized several peace rallies at Humboldt Park. There were also marches and demonstrations, including a march on June 28, 1966, at which over 200 Puerto Ricans from the Division Street area marched five miles to City Hall to protest the city government's negligence and police brutality.Padilla, Felix M. (1987). Puerto Rican Chicago. University of Notre Dame Press. p. 156. A month after the riot, the Chicago Commission on Human Relations held open hearings, which provided a forum for Puerto Rican and other Spanish-speaking residents of Chicago to discuss problems facing these communities. They discussed the displacement and discrimination in housing, discriminatory practices by the police and fire departments, and poor educational opportunities. The hearings lasted for two days. During the hearings, Puerto Ricans cited a lack of jobs, poor housing and education, little political power, union discrimination, inadequate city services, and police brutality. As a result of these meetings, the Puerto Rican community proposed specific policy recommendations. With support from Community Action Agencies in the Division Street Area, the riots inspired the creation of Puerto Rican community organizations.Padilla, Felix M. (1987). Puerto Rican Chicago. University of Notre Dame Press. p. 157. These include the Spanish Action Committee of Chicago (SACC), the Latin American Defense Organization (LADO), the Bickerdike Revedelopment Corporation, the ASPIRA Association and the Young Lords (in 1968); cultural centers such as the Ruiz Belvis Cultural Center and the Juan Antonio Corretjer Puerto Rican Cultural Center; and a school, the Escuela Superior Puertorrique√±a (which is now named Dr. Pedro Albiz√∫ Campos Puerto Rican High School). Developing from the riots, these organizations' members were younger and more militant than earlier organizations such as the Caballeros de San Juan, Damas de Mar√≠a and the Puerto Rican Congress. They worked to get community concerns such as education, housing, health, and employment addressed by the city and to assert a Puerto Rican presence in city politics.

He was instrumental in putting down the Revolt of 1837, he led the force that captured the Texan Santa Fe Expedition, and he later surrendered to the United States in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, leading to the Capture of Santa Fe. Early life and first governorship Manuel Armijo was born, 1793, in the Albuquerque, New Mexico area, most likely in Belen. He was the son of Vicente Ferrer Duran y Armijo and B√°rbara Casilda Dur√°n y Ch√°ves, both from prominent New Mexico families. Vicente Armijo and his family resided in the Plaza de San Antonio de Bel√©n during the 1790s, and according to the Spanish census, Vicente was a stockman and lieutenant in the militia. Manuel Armijo married Mar√≠a Trinidad Gabald√≥n in 1819. The couple did not have children, but adopted a daughter named Ramona, who was named \\"my universal heir and daughter\\" in Manuel's will. Ramona Armijo was married to Lu√≠s C. de Baca of Socorro, New Mexico. According to George Wilkins Kendall, Armijo became wealthy by working for a sheep rancher and stealing and selling the sheep, often to his own employer; but Kendall was writing about his experience as Armijo's prisoner in 1841 and his biographical sketch of Armijo is scurrilous.The Santa F√© Expedition - Kendall Account 3 from Sons of DeWitt Colony Texas, published in 1844, accessed 19 June 2006. The historian Marc Simmons ascribes the story of sheep theft to \\"tradition\\". William Wroth wrote on the New Mexico State Historian's Website, \\"Governor Armijo was portrayed by George Wilkins Kendall as having been an uneducated man from a poor family who worked his way up by stealing. This gross caricature was Kendall's way of vilifying Armijo due to his perception that the Governor had treated him unfairly in 1841 in the capture of the disastrous Texas Santa Fe expedition.\\" In general, according to many Hispanic New Mexicans, historians have been unfair in their telling of the history of Manuel Armijo. Ang√©lico Ch√°vez wrote, \\"Manuel Armijo's character as Governor and as a man has been unjustly painted in sources too numerous to mention here.\\" Armijo became the alcalde (mayor) of Albuquerque and militia lieutenant in 1822 and 1824. In 1827, he was appointed governor of New Mexico, but in 1828 he returned from Santa Fe to Albuquerque as a wealthy merchant in sheep and wool blankets, acting as alcalde again.Manuel Armijo from The Latina/o History Project, accessed 19 June 2006 Some have it that he left the governorship to avoid a Federal investigation., cited by Simmons In 1836 Armijo was appointed subcomisario, collector of customs, of New Mexico; this was a fund-raising position that involved work in Santa Fe. However, for health reasons he spent most of his time in Albuquerque and was replaced. Revolt of 1837 In August 1837 disaffected residents of the northern part of New Mexico assassinated Governor Albino P√©rez and took over the state (the Revolt of 1837). Many people in the southern part opposed the new government, but several prominent people refused to lead a counterrevolution. Mariano Ch√°vez, a wealthy young relative of Armijo's, proposed him for the position and Armijo accepted. He marched to Santa Fe and declared himself governor, a position that the Mexican government also gave him when the news of the rebellion reached them (and not when Armijo's letter announcing his self- appointment reached them later, contrary to Kendall's account). Armijo wrote to the government requesting federal troops, and trained soldiers under Lt. Col. Cayetano Justiniani of the Veracruz dragoons arrived in early January 1838. Later that month the rebellion flared up again and Armijo led the force that defeated the rebels at Pojoaque. According to Armijo's letters to the Mexican historian Carlos Mar√≠a Bustamante, he was nominally in command but his forces were really led by Justiniani. Beginning with Kendall, some American authors have accused Armijo of starting the rebellion that he later put down. The trader and writer Josiah Gregg said Armijo's brother \\"intimated\\" to Gregg that Armijo had ridden from Albuquerque to Santa Fe expecting the rebels to elect him governor. As he had taken no personal part in the insurrection, they \\"would not acknowledge his claim to their suffrages,\\" so he returned to Albuquerque to plot the counterrevolution. The historian Janet Lecompte doubts this story and notes that there is no documentary evidence of any involvement of Armijo in the Revolt of 1837. Second term In 1841 Armijo successfully repelled the Texan Santa Fe Expedition. He evidently authorized false promises of safe conduct, but instead took the Texan merchants and soldiers into custody and sent them further south in Mexico as prisoners. Stories about Armijo's corruption made it into Euro-American accounts of the region to justify a U.S. invasion. It was also rumored that he was having an illicit affair with the wealthy Santa Fe saloon owner Maria Gertrudis \\"Tules\\" Barcel√≥.Deena J. Gonz√°lez, Refusing the Favor: The Spanish Mexican Women of Santa Fe, 1820-1880, (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999), p.75. Also during this period he eagerly approved land grants to Americans, selling in some of the largest land grants ever made.Spanish-Mexican Land Grants from the Colorado State Archives, accessed 19 June 2006 For example, in January 1841 Charles Beaubien and Guadalupe Miranda petitioned Armijo for a grant of of land east of the Sangre de Cristo range. Charles Bent was given part of that land, even though he was not a Mexican citizen. When Padre Martinez of Taos learned of the grant, he raised such a strong objection that Armijo withdrew the grant that summer. Armijo later reinstated the grant when Beaubien died, giving it to his son-in-law, Lucien Maxwell. In 1843 the Republic of Texas sent another force into New Mexico to retaliate for the capture of the Texan Santa Fe Expedition and Mexican attacks on Texas. This force, with something over 200 men, defeated a New Mexican advance party. Armijo, camped away with 500 men, \\"fled in terror\\" on hearing the news. He then resigned his position as military commander and in the following year, the governorship, \\"claiming ill health\\". Third term and Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War Nevertheless, he was appointed to his third governorship in 1845. The following year, the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War started and General Stephen Kearny brought about 1,700 soldiers to conquer New Mexico. Armijo heard of the plan in late June from an American business partner who arrived with a caravan on the Santa Fe Trail. Armijo sold his interest in their business to his partner and began liquidating his many other assets. Armijo also sent in a request to the Mexican government asking for regular troops to be sent for defense of New Mexico. The Mexican government officials promised to send these forces, yet they never arrived.Ch√°vez, Thomas E., New Mexico Past and Future, 2006, University of New Mexico Press, , pp. 113‚Äì114Roberts, Calvin & Susana, A History of New Mexico, 2004, University of New Mexico Press. . pp. 203‚Äì204 He also received a large amount of ammunition and supplies from a caravan out of Independence, Missouri. On August 4, as Kearny crossed what is now the border between Colorado and New Mexico, Armijo signed a power of attorney so that an associate could take care of his affairs after he left. On August 8 he issued a proclamation to the people of New Mexico exhorting them to prepare to repel the invasion. On about August 9 Armijo called a meeting with a number of respected New Mexicans. He did not want to fight, but the priests present did, as did the young regular-army commander, Diego Archuleta, and the young militia officers Manuel Chaves and Miguel Pino. According to a refugee from the war, Armijo would have done nothing toward defense if the latter two had not threatened to shoot him. Then on August 12 or 13 he received an American named James Magoffin, the husband of a relative of his, who later claimed to have convinced Armijo not to fight. An unverified story says that Magoffin bribed them. Magoffin later requested a reimbursement from the U.S. Treasury of $50,000, of which he received $30,000.Howe, Daniel Walker, What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815‚Äì1848. , p. 759. Another version of this story is that a spy of Governor Armijo was captured by Kearny, and given a tour of Kearny's forces in order for the spy to report to Armijo about the size and strength of the United States forces. Next Kearny sent Anglo- American trader, \\"James Magoffin, along with Captain Philip St. George Cooke and twelve dragoons to meet with the governor.\\" Manuel Alvarez arranged a meeting with Armijo, his officials and Magoffin and St. George Cooke. According to Alvarez, despite knowing the size and strength of the United States forces, Governor Armijo was the only government official who wanted to defend New Mexico while the others were convinced that a disastrous defeat would be the outcome of any futile attempt at defense.Ch√°vez, Thomas E., New Mexico Past and Future, 2006, University of New Mexico Press, 978-0826334442, pp. 113‚Äì114 It wasn't until the governor called for the militia to meet at Apache Canyon to prepare for defense of New Mexico that he changed his mind. When he saw that his militia had weapons of spears, bows, arrows and outdated firearms, he knew they were outnumbered, too under-trained and under-equipped to meet the regular United States's army. After inspecting his men, he sent them home. Armijo decided he should go to Mexico and plead for more help from the Mexican government. According to a previous New Mexico State Historian, Thomas E. Ch√°vez, there is no evidence that Armijo ever took a bribe, yet to the contrary, there is evidence to prove that Armijo was one of the few who wanted to fight the invaders. Around this same time some Santa Feans talked of killing the American traders in the town, but Armijo put a stop to the plan and dismissed Archuleta.One Offense of the Pueblos In any case, at the Battle of Santa Fe, Armijo set up a position in Apache Canyon, a narrow pass about southeast of the city, Includes a link to a map. but decided not to fight before the American army was even in sight. When Pino, Chaves and some of the militiamen insisted, Armijo ordered the cannon pointed at them. All of the New Mexican army retreated to Santa Fe and Armijo fled to Chihuahua, while Kearny and his force entered Santa Fe and claimed New Mexico for the U.S. without a shot fired. Armijo was tried in Mexico City for cowardice and desertion in the face of the enemy, but he was acquitted. While in Mexico City, he interceded on behalf of Magoffin, who had been arrested as a spy in Chihuahua. Armijo later returned to Lemitar, New Mexico,Census Place: Limitar, Valencia, New Mexico Territory; Roll: M432_470; Page: 331; Image: 252 and lived the rest of his life there.

The precast prestressed concrete girder bridge crosses near the river mouth as it empties into Botany Bay; and links the St George and Sutherland areas of Sydney. The bridge comprises a dual carriageway with three lanes in each direction of highway grade-separated conditions; and pedestrian and bicycle traffic, via two grade-separated paths. on the eastern and western sides of the bridge. Location and features The Captain Cook Bridge consists of seven spans totalling in length, with a long deck that is wide with six traffic lanes and two shared bicycle and pedestrian paths. Its foundations extend as deep as below water level to its sandstone base. The bridge was opened on 29 May 1965 and links Rocky Point Road at Sans Souci in the St George area to Taren Point Road at Taren Point in the Sutherland Shire. Loop walkways run under the bridge at both sides and provide access along the foreshore. The bridge was designed by a team of engineers from the Department of Main Roads (DMR) led by Albert Fried. The DMR's Resident Engineer for the construction was Ray Wedgwood, who was later the Chief Bridge Engineer for the Roads and Traffic Authority. The main contractor was John Holland Group. The bridge is the easternmost of the seven major crossings of Georges River. The others are Tom Uglys Bridge, which opened in 1929, Alfords Point Bridge (1973, duplicated 2008), M5 Milperra bridge (1992), Milperra Bridge (replacement bridge 1966), Liverpool Bridge (replacement bridge 1958), and M5 Casula bridge (1985, widened 1988). The Captain Cook Bridge is the only section of the planned F6 Freeway that has been built in the Sydney metropolitan area, with the other built sections being between and Bulli Tops and further south between and . On the southern approach the two carriageways of the approach road diverge to allow for construction of a future interchange to also carry freeway traffic to and from the bridge. The speed limit on the bridge and the 1km (0.62 miles) of freeway on the southern approach is . The bridge was designed to have the capacity to carry 30,000 vehicles on a weekday, but in 2015 the bridge was estimated to be carrying 30,600 vehicles per weekday.  History  A ferry service ran between Sans Souci and Taren Point from 1911. From April 1916 a vehicular punt ran between the two points, and continued to do so even after the opening of the Tom Uglys Bridge in 1929. The Captain Cook Bridge is named in honour of Captain James Cook, a British explorer, navigator, cartographer, and captain in the Royal Navy, who landed at nearby Kurnell on 29 April 1770, during his first voyage of discovery aboard the Endeavour. A big part of commissioning construction of the Captain Cook Bridge in 1962 was the fact that the nearby three-laned Tom Ugly's Bridge was carrying more traffic than any three lanes of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and the Taren Point punt was at full capacity carrying 1000 cars daily.

It premiered on NBC on February 20, 1974. The film tells the story of a wife and mother who is raped twice by the same man and her ordeals dealing with the actual rape and her subsequent dealing with the police and the trial. Plot Ellen Harrod appears to have a happy marriage to David, although his frequent work-related absences are beginning to take a toll on her. While taking night school classes with her neighbor and best friend, Marge Bracken, she is introduced to Larry Retzliff. Ellen and Marge accept a ride home from Retzliff the same night while David is away. Once Ellen is in her apartment, Retzliff arrives claiming car trouble and asks to use the phone. When Ellen lets him in, he overpowers and rapes her. Unable to reach David by phone, and emotionally unable to report the crime, Ellen decides to put the attack behind her, and tries through three showers to literally wash away the rape. When David returns, she is still unable to get his attention long enough to tell him about the attack. Having had an anonymous blood test, Ellen makes a serious effort to forget the attack and resume her life. This attempt comes to a crashing halt four days after the initial attack in a parking garage when Retzliff, who has been waiting for Ellen behind the front seat of her car, rapes her again, this time beating her viciously. After reporting the attack, the treatment that Ellen receives from the police, doctors, and detectives is anything but sympathetic. While the District Attorney, Leonard Alexander, appears to have her best interests at heart, he clearly has his reservations. Defending Retzliff is ruthless attorney Muriel Dyer who bullies and interrogates witnesses and Ellen herself on the stand in an attempt to get Retzliff off. Dyer's efforts succeed and Retzliff is found not guilty. Following the trial, attorney Alexander comments, \\"Never try a rape case unless your victim is a 90-year-old nun with at least four stab wounds.\\" After this, Retzliff mockingly apologizes to Ellen, saying \\"no hard feelings\\", but Ellen calmly but coldly tells him, \\"If you ever come near me again, I'll kill you.\\" A voiceover narration at the end of the movie reveals that shortly after the trial, Retzliff attempts to rape someone else. While trying to escape from the police, he is shot and wounded, and ends up pleading guilty to the rape and sentenced to prison. Ellen and David's marriage is strained by the events of the film, and the narration reveals that Ellen later files for divorce.

As reported by the A&E; series Biography, Montgomery believed so strongly in the story that she threatened to leave the project if the scene was cut. Montgomery prevailed, and the film was shown in its entirety along with warnings of the mature subject matter.

New York: Church Publishing Inc. , p. 475. is a retired American bishop. She was the 10th Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Utah. At the time of her election and consecration in 1996 she became the fourth woman in the Episcopal Church to hold the office of bishop. Education Irish received a B.A. degree with high honors in philosophy from the University of Michigan in 1962 after having transferred from Stanford University where she began her studies in 1958. Also at Michigan she was granted membership in the Phi Kappa Phi Honorary Society. In 1968, she earned a Master of Letters (M.Litt) degree in moral philosophy from Linacre College, University of Oxford. Having enrolled in seminary in 1979, Irish received a Master of Divinity (M.Div) degree, cum laude, from the Virginia Theological Seminary in 1983. She holds honorary doctoral degrees from Virginia Theological Seminary, Westminster College in Salt Lake City, the University of Utah, The Church Divinity School of the Pacific, the Salt Lake Community College, and Utah State University. Background Irish was born in 1940 and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah, daughter of Utah businessman, philanthropist, and University of Utah philosophy professor Obert Clark Tanner. During her upbringing, her family was active in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but she stopped attending church after she left home for college. In 1960, while at Stanford University, she married Leon E. Irish, another Stanford student, who later earned a law degree from the University of Michigan and a D.Phil. from Oxford University. She studied at Linacre College, Oxford, where she is an honorary fellow. Together they have four children; Stephen, Jessica, Thomas, and Emily. Because of her children, Irish began attending church again in 1975 and said of the Episcopal Church, \\"I was surprised when I realized that this was my home.\\" By 1977 she was considering entering the ordained ministry and two years later began seminary. Having been raised and baptized in the LDS Church, there has been debate in some circles over the validity of her baptism and subsequent ordination because of differences in theology between the two churches. However, at the time of her confirmation into the Episcopal Church, her baptism was recognized as valid. The sacraments of baptism and confirmation are both prerequisites of ordination in the Episcopal Church. In 1983, Irish was ordained to the diaconate, followed in 1984 by her ordination to the priesthood in the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, D.C. As a priest, she served congregations in the dioceses of Washington, D.C., Virginia, and Michigan. She was appointed archdeacon in the Diocese of Michigan in 1986, and later served on the staff of the Shalem Institute for Spiritual Formation, and the Washington National Cathedral. Throughout her service, Irish led a program called Project Jubilee. All 22 churches and a number of ministries have benefited from Project Jubilee grants and loans that purchased land, paid mortgages, assisted construction, and made the very existence of several parishes a reality. Most recently, Project Jubilee funds were used for a portion of the new Episcopal Church Center of Utah. The funds came from the Perpetual Trust of Sts. Peter and Paul, which resulted from the sale of St. Mark's Hospital under her predecessor, Bishop George Bates. Irish was originally elected as bishop coadjutor near the end of Bishop Bates' service. Irish also followed a policy of financial transparency, so all could see the monetary blessings the diocese has had to enrich its work and outreach. In addition to her episcopal duties, Irish also currently serves as chair of the board of O.C. Tanner Co., the employee recognition company founded by her father. Irish also serves on the Standing Committee on Ecumenical Relations for the National Episcopal Church and the Advisory Board of the Shalem Institute for Spiritual Formation as well as the boards of directors of the Tanner Lectures on Human Values and the Nature Conservancy of Utah. The Carolyn Tanner Irish Humanities Building at the University of Utah bears her name.http://www.hum.utah.edu/?&pageId;=1528 She also established a reputation as a community leader. Outspoken from the start of her service, she supported minorities and opposed allowing guns in churches. She also fought political movements to make English the only language that could be used in governmental laws and information. She holds honorary doctorates from the University of Utah, Utah State University, Salt Lake Community College, Westminster and Weber State University. In 1988, Irish was divorced from her husband after 28 years of marriage. In 1999, she took a leave of absence to cope with her alcoholism. In 2001, she married the Rev. Frederick Quinn, a retired foreign service officer and author. In 2010, Irish retired from her Episcopal Church position and continues her Utah ties, but primarily lives in Washington D.C. She and her husband have six adult children between them, with most of them living in the eastern United States.

Some time later he moved to Albany, New York where he painted a number of prominent people, including early portraits of Governor George Clinton and Alexander Hamilton. It is not known whether Ames was formally trained or not, but his work had a popular appeal. In addition to portraits and landscapes, Ames' surviving accounts books indicated he painted miniatures, carriages, fire buckets, fences, mirror frames, and furniture. Ames painted a number of still lifes, landscapes, and history paintings, and was skilled at engraving. The Chautauqan Magazine describes his importance in this way; \\"(he) was the most noted portraitist in the state, outside New York city. The sure and fluent ease of his brush, his keen characterization, his pure, fresh coloring, are all remarkable for this early period. His portrait of Governor George Clinton, exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy in 1812, won him wide notice; but he did delightful work some years earlier, and many even finer canvases are scattered through the middle states, in private hands.\\" During his career Ames painted many members of the New York State legislature and retired comfortably on his savings built up during his prolific career, primarily between 1800 and 1820. In fact he became known unofficially as the (official) New York State portrait painter. Ames was an active freemason, which brought him a number of commissions from his fellows. Ames served as chairman of the Fine Arts Committee of the Society for the Promotion of Useful Arts in 1805, and was also President of the Mechanics and Farmers' Bank of Albany. He died in 1836 and is buried at the Albany Rural Cemetery (Lot 1 Section 59). Ames was posthumously elected an honorary member of the American Academy of Fine Arts in New York City. Ames had three children, two of whom followed him into the business: Angelo Ames and Julius Rubens Ames (1801‚Äì1850).

Founded in 1982 by developer/philanthropist James W. Rouse and his wife Patty, Enterprise has worked with community-based nonprofit organizations to develop 585,000 homes, investing $43 billion throughout the United States. Enterprise is a family of companies including Enterprise Community Investment, Enterprise Community Asset Management; Enterprise Community Loan Fund, and Enterprise Homes and Community Preservation and Development Corporation. The organization has 11 regional markets and office locations across the country, including a team in Washington, D.C. Mission Enterprise's mission is to create opportunity for low- and moderate income people through affordable housing. They deliver capital, develop the programs and advocate for the policies needed to create and preserve well-designed homes that people can afford in inclusive and connected communities.  History  In 1972, three members of the Church of the Saviour‚ÄîTerry Flood, Barbara Moore and Carolyn Banker‚Äîwanted to create low-income housing in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of D.C. With no development, financial or construction experience, they put down a non-refundable deposit to purchase the Ritz and Mozart apartment buildings. Their commitment won over James Rouse, CEO of The Rouse Company and he helped them secure $625,000 to complete the transaction and $125,000 toward the cost of rehabilitation. In 1981 the experience inspired Jim Rouse to found Robin Hood Inc. based in the Rouse owned American City building in Columbia, Maryland. The company was renamed to Jubilee Housing to help with fundraising efforts. Jubilee Housing provided the launchpad for Jim and Patty Rouse to start the Enterprise Foundation in 1982. In 2005, it was renamed Enterprise Community Partners. Today, Enterprise continues to work to uphold the standards set by Jim and Patty to see that all people have the opportunity for affordable housing. In 1984, Jim Rouse was soliciting business representing both Rouse Company as CEO and Enterprise Development as president. The Rouse Company board of directors asked Jim Rouse to leave as CEO of the Rouse Company and his position in Enterprise Development which ended his involvement with the company he founded.

Thus, comes the root of Borgetto, Burj, which translates to tower in Arabic. Borgetto is the combination of Burj (tower) and -etto (a suffix meaning small in Italian).

The United States Army Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps is one of four premier musical organizations of the United States Army. Members perform using musical instruments and wearing uniforms similar to those used by military musicians of the Continental Army during the American Revolution. It is the only unit of its kind in the United States' armed forces, and is part of the 3rd U.S. Infantry (\\"The Old Guard\\"). The Fife and Drum Corps has been stationed at Fort Myer, Virginia, since its founding on February 23, 1960. Musicians The United States Army Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps perform during a State Arrival Ceremony held on the South Lawn of the White House. The musicians of this unit recall the fifes and drums from the days of the American Revolution as they perform in uniforms patterned after those worn by the musicians of Gen. George Washington's Continental Army. Military musicians of the period wore the reverse colors of the regiments to which they were assigned. The uniforms worn by the members of the Corps are dated circa 1781, and consist of black tricorn hats, white wigs, waistcoats, colonial coveralls, and red regimental coats. The 69-member Corps uses 10-hole fifes, handmade rope-tensioned drums and single-valve bugles, which bring to life the exciting sounds of the Continental Army. =The Troop Step= Perhaps the most distinctive signature of the musicians of this unit is the troop step, reminiscent of the ceremonial steps of the Household Regiments of the British Army. While playing their instruments, the musicians march forward at a slow, ceremonial pace, while pointing their toes, toe touching the ground first.A day in the Life of the Old Guard, the Army's oldest unit. minute 28:10/51:16 accessdate=2013-11-10 After these troop steps, typically, the Fife and Drum Corps changes back to normal pace, stepping off at normal step, playing Yankee Doodle, to the applause of the crowds.The Old Guard performs for The Old Guard Association's 2012 Reunion minute 17:14/43:58 accessdate=2013-11-10 =Drum Major= The drum major of the unit is distinguished from the other musicians by his headgear, the light-infantry Cap. In contrast to modern Army bands, and as an indication of prominence, he carries an espontoon instead of the standard mace. The espontoon is an 18th- century weapon carried by officers. However, it is used by the drum major to issue silent commands to the Corps. As the espontoon remains in the drum major‚Äôs right hand, the drum major is the only member of the U.S. Army authorised to render a left-handed salute. A mockery is made of this statement in the next picture, whereby the drum major can be seen carrying his espontoon in his left hand. Performances The Corps at the 58th Presidential Inauguration. As an official representative of the U.S. Army, the Corps averages over 500 performances annually. The Corps has entertained millions of people in major parades, pageants and historical celebrations throughout the United States; and has served America as a goodwill ambassador as far away as Europe, Australia and Canada. Major sporting events the Corps has performed at include NCAA bowl games, NBA games, NFL games (including Super Bowls), the Kentucky Derby, the Indianapolis 500, and the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. In support of the President of the United States, the Corps performs at armed forces arrival ceremonies for visiting dignitaries and heads of state at the White House, and has participated in every presidential inaugural parade since President John F. Kennedy's in 1961. The Corps also performed at the funeral of Kennedy. Today both men and women are members of the unit. Instruments The Corps personnel play fifes, bugles, and drums (snares and basses). Obtaining the instruments posed a challenge, as only a few manufacturers produce historical instruments. A batch of 20 drums were produced in Basel, Switzerland, home to the Carnival of Basel, where a long tradition of marching drums and piccolo flutes is alive.\\"Swiss drums for Obama: Basel firm makes drums for US state ceremonies.\\" Video report on manufacturing the drums by swissinfo (in English) http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/multimedia/basel-firm-makes-drums-for-us-state- ceremonies/32714698 Again, some of the fifes were produced in Switzerland, in the manufacture of a professional musician and U.S. ex-pat.\\"Traditionelle Instrumente: Donald Trump h√∂rt bei Amtseinsetzung Frei√§mter Fl√∂ten\\", Schweizer Fernsehen (in German) https://www.srf.ch/news/regional/aargau- solothurn/donald-trump-hoert-bei-amtseinsetzung-freiaemter-floeten Gallery File:Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps at Fort Myer 2008-04-23.jpgThe United States Army Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps thrill an audience with their musical skills while on parade in 2008.

A novelization of the screenplay was written by Howard Melvin Fast writing under the pseudonym E.V. Cunningham. Plot Penelope Elcott (Natalie Wood) is the wife of wealthy banker James Elcott (Ian Bannen). Penelope decides to disguise herself as an old woman and rob her husband's bank. While the police, including Lieutenant Horatio Bixbee (Peter Falk), rush to get to the bank, Penelope escapes in a red wig and yellow suit. She donates some of the stolen money to a Salvation Army worker and donates the suit to a second- hand thrift shop. Con artists Sabada (Lila Kedrova) and Ducky (Lou Jacobi) immediately recognize the suit as an original designer outfit from Paris, and purchase it for a mere $7. Penelope visits her psychiatrist Gregory (Dick Shawn) and tells him all about her criminal activities. She says it began in college when a professor (Jonathan Winters) lured her into his laboratory and attempted to rape her, but she escaped, leaving her dress ripped off in the process. During the chase, she stole the watch fob of the professor. She next stole on her wedding day. When she caught her maid of honor Mildred Halliday (Norma Crane) kissing James, she swiped Mildred's earrings and necklace. Gregory suggests she is stealing to attract attention from her distant husband. A young woman, Honeysuckle Rose, is accused of being the thief. Gregory wants to return the stolen money to the bank, but panics when he hears police cars arriving. Penelope confesses and tries to clear the innocent Honeysuckle, but Horatio the cop and husband James do not believe her. Ducky and Sabada pay a visit, trying to blackmail her, but Penelope foils their blackmail attempt. Penelope hosts a dinner party, having stolen from all the invited guests. She tries to return the stolen items, but all claim that they never have seen them before. Penelope, confused and frightened, runs away. She again robs James' bank, but unlike the previous time, she is crying. James begs Horatio to find her. Penelope goes to Horatio with the stolen money, but the cop knows James would not press charges against his own wife. The psychiatrist explains the dinner guests denied recognizing the stolen items because they would lose the fraudulently inflated insurance claims they collected. Gregory breaks down and begs Penelope to run away with him. She refuses, telling him she is cured. James realizes that he has neglected Penelope and starts seeing her face everywhere he turns. He goes to the psychiatrist's office, where James and Penelope happily reunite. Cast * Natalie Wood as Penelope Elcott * Ian Bannen as James B.

The matchup between the Spartans and the Paladins is also the first time that USC Upstate has hosted a top-25 opponent since becoming an NCAA Division 1 program during the 2007‚Äì08 season. With 353 teams currently competing in NCAA Division I men's basketball, it will also marked the first time that the division's smallest arena has hosted a ranked opponent. Although leading 34‚Äì30 at halftime, the Spartans ultimately fell to the Paladins 74‚Äì60. Renovations In October 2009, it was announced that the G. B. Hodge Center would undergo a large renovation thanks to the $4 million donation from alumnus Dolores Anderson. Anderson is a longtime fan of the University of South Carolina Upstate basketball team, particularly the men's team. She is the former co owner of Anderson Hardwood Company. This gift is the largest donation to the university athletic department and second largest ever to the university. Plans for the new arena include brand new floors, lighting, scoreboards, locker rooms, and seating. The university believes that the new renovation will help move into a second renovation later that would create a new entrance and new athletic department offices.

Insomnia can be the difficulty to fall asleep or to wake up before the individual has slept enough. About 20% of the working population participates in shift work. SWSD commonly goes undiagnosed, so it's estimated that 10-40% of shift workers suffer from SWSD. The excessive sleepiness appears when the individual has to be productive, awake and alert. Both symptoms are predominant in SWSD. There are numerous shift work schedules, and they may be permanent, intermittent, or rotating; consequently, the manifestations of SWSD are quite variable. Most people with different schedules than the ordinary one (from 8 AM to 6 PM) might have these symptoms but the difference is that SWSD is continual, long-term, and starts to interfere with the individual's life.  Health effects  There have been many studies suggesting health risks associated with shift work. Many studies have associated sleep disorders with decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and risk for fracture. Researchers have found that those who work long-term in night positions, like nurses, are at a great risk for wrist and hip fractures (RR = 1.37). Low fertility and issues during pregnancy are increased in shift workers. Obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemias were shown to be much higher in those who work night shift. SWSD can increase the risk of mental disorders. Specifically, depression, anxiety, and alcohol abuse is increased in shift workers. Because the circadian system regulates the rate of chemical substances in the body, when it is impaired, several consequences are possible. Acute sleep loss has been shown to increase the levels of t-tau in blood plasma, which may explain the neurocognitive effects of sleep loss. = Sleep quality = Sleep loss and decreased quality of sleep is another effect of shift work. To promote a healthy lifestyle, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommended that an adult have 7 or more hours of sleep per day. Each year there are almost 100,000 deaths estimated in the U.S. because of medical errors. Sleep deprivation and sleep disorders are factors that contribute significantly to these errors. In the same article, the authors affirm that there is a high prevalence of sleepiness and symptoms of sleep disorders related to the circadian system in medical center nurses. In a study done with around 1100 nurses, almost half of them (49%) reported sleeping less than 7 hours per day, a significant increase compared to national figures, in which 28% of people claimed to sleep less than 7 hours per night. Having a lack of sleep can impact cognitive performance. For example, it might become difficult to stay focused and concentrate, and reaction times might also be slowed down. SWSD might interfere with making decisions quickly, driving, or flying safely. Sleep loss seen in shift workers greatly impairs cognitive performance, being awake for 24 hrs. straight results in a cognitive performance that is equal to a blood-alcohol of 0.10, which is over the legal limit in most states. All of these factors can affect work efficiency and cause accidents. Michael Lee et al. demonstrated that those working night shifts had a significantly higher risk of hazardous driving events when compared to those on a typical day shift schedule. Accidents in the workplace have been found to be 60% higher in shift workers. They can affect the individual's social life and cause a lack of well-being and happiness. Poor sleep quality has also been associated with decreased quality of life, based on a SF-36 assessment. = Sleep and alertness = Although SWD affects a majority of shift workers, its manifestation is still unclear within the general shift-working population. A field study investigating the nature of SWD in an experimental (with SWD) and control (non-SWD) group of Finnish shift workers revealed decreased total sleep time (TST) and increased sleep deficit before morning shifts. Furthermore, the SWD group also exhibited decreased objective sleep efficiency, decreased in sleep compensation over the weekends, increased sleep latency, and finally poorer sleep quality was recorded in the SWD group compared to the non-SWD group. Moreover, shift workers with SWD scored significantly higher on the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) when assessed at the end of night shifts but at the beginning and the end of morning shifts. Many studies have shown evidence of how partial and total sleep deprivation affects work productivity, absenteeism, fatal workplace accidents, and more. In a study by Akkerstedt et al., those who had a hard time sleeping in the past two weeks were at a greater risk for having a fatal workplace accident (RR = 1.89, 95% CI 1.22 - 2.94). Other sleep disorders, like OSA which are risk factors for SWSD, have also been associated with low productivity, absenteeism, and accidents. At a cognitive level, sleep deprivation has been shown to cause decreased attentiveness, increased micro-sleeps, delayed psychomotor response, performance deterioration, neglect of activities, decline in working memory, and more. = Immune functioning = Partial and total sleep deprivation has been linked to an increase of pro-inflammatory markers, such as IL-6, and a decrease in anti-inflammatory markers, such as IL-10, that plays a role in tumor suppression. Chronic shift work has been associated with decreased immune function in nurses. In a study by Naigi, et. al., over the course of a shift, nurses exhibited decreasing levels of Natural Killer cells, an innate immune response that plays a role in infectious disease and tumor suppression. Other researchers have found that less sleep at night increased the risk of developing the common cold. A supporting study by Moher et al. showed that shift workers were more likely to develop infectious diseases after exposure compared to daytime workers. A poorly functioning immune system may leave workers vulnerable for developing occupational illnesses. Sleep loss is also associated with an increase in TNF, a marker of systemic immune functioning. = Cardiovascular disease = Decreased sleep quality and duration have also been associated with other chronic illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease. Many studies have shown that prolonged sleeplessness and sleep disorders, such as OSA, increases systemic levels of CRP, a marker of cardiovascular disease. Many studies have shown that lack of sleep causes blood pressure to increase from the prolonged stimulation of the nervous system. The increase of inflammatory markers, like IL-6, up-regulate the production of CRP.  SWSD in firefighters  SWSD can effect many occupations, but firefighters are at a greater risk because of their extended (24hr) shift and frequent sleep interruptions due to emergencies. Many firefighters suffer from sleep disorders as a result of their extended shift and frequently disrupted sleep. In a study on firefighters by Barger, et al., over a third of study participants screened positive for a sleep disorder, but most had not received a previous medical diagnosis for any sleep disorders. Those with sleep disorders were also at a higher risk for being in a motor vehicle crash (OR = 2.0 95% CI 1.29-3.12, p = 0.0021), near crash (OR = 2.49 95% CI 2.13 -2.91, p < 0.0001), and nodding off while driving (OR = 2.41 95% CI 2.06-2.82, p < 0.0001).  Symptoms  * Excessive sleepiness * Difficulty sleeping * Difficulty concentrating * Headaches * Lack of energy  Cause Insomnia and wake-time sleepiness are related to misalignment between the timing of a non-standard wake‚Äìsleep schedule and the endogenous circadian propensity for sleep and wake. In addition to circadian misalignment, attempted sleep at unusual times can be interrupted by noise, social obligations, and other factors. There is an inevitable degree of sleep deprivation associated with sudden transitions in sleep schedule. The prevalence of SWSD is unclear because it is not often formally diagnosed but it is estimated to affect 5‚Äì10% of night and rotating workers. There are various risk factors, including age. Although SWSD can appear at any age, the highest prevalence is in the 50 years old and above age bracket and even more so in cases of irregular schedules. Gender is also a factor. It may be that female night workers sleep less than their male counterparts. A possible explanation is the social obligations that can increase their vulnerability to SWSD. Female night workers also seem to be more sleepy at work. Some people are more affected by shift work and sleeplessness than others, and some will be impaired on some tasks while others will always perform well on the same tasks. Some people have a morning preference but others not. Genetic predisposition is an important predictor of which people are vulnerable to SWSD.  Mechanism  Brain arousal is stimulated by the circadian system during the day and sleep is usually stimulated at night. The rhythms are maintained in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), located in the anterior hypothalamus in the brain, and synchronized with the day/night cycle. Gene- transcription feedback loops in individual SCN cells form the molecular basis of biological timekeeping. Circadian phase shifts are dependent on the schedule of light exposure, the intensity, and previous exposure to light. Variations in exposure can advance or delay these rhythms. For example, the rhythms can be delayed due to light exposure at night. Photoreceptors located in the retina of the eye send information about environmental light through the retinohypothalamic tract to the SCN. The SCN regulates the pineal gland, which secretes the hormone melatonin. Typically, the secretion of melatonin begins two hours before bedtime and ends two hours prior to waking up. A decline in neuronal firing in the SCN is caused by the binding of melatonin to the MT1 and MT2 melatonin receptors. It is believed that the reduction in firing in the SCN stimulates sleep. While day-active individuals produce melatonin at night, night shift workers' production of melatonin is suppressed at night due to light exposure. = Circadian misalignment = Circadian misalignment plays a major role in shift work sleep disorder. Circadian misalignment occurs when there is no complete adaptation to a night shift schedule. The hormones cortisol and melatonin are an important part of the circadian rhythm. In circadian misalignment, cortisol and melatonin lack entrainment to a night oriented schedule and stay on a daytime schedule. Melatonin continues to peak at night during a shift workers awake time and decreases during a shift workers sleep time. Cortisol levels are lower during a shift workers awake time and remain higher during shift workers sleep time.  Diagnosis  The primary symptoms of shift work sleep disorder are insomnia and excessive sleepiness associated with working (and sleeping) at non- standard times. Shift work sleep disorder is also associated with falling asleep at work. Total daily sleep time is usually shortened and sleep quality is less in those who work night shifts compared to those who work day shifts. Sleepiness is manifested as a desire to nap, unintended dozing, impaired mental acuity, irritability, reduced performance, and accident proneness. Shift work is often combined with extended hours of duty, so fatigue can be a compounding factor. The symptoms coincide with the duration of shift work and usually remit with the adoption of a conventional sleep-wake schedule. The boundary between a \\"normal response\\" to the rigors of shift work and a diagnosable disorder is not sharp. There are criteria of SWSD in the International Classification of Sleep Disorder - Third Edition (ICSD-3) and in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). The diagnosis requires the following assumptions : * There is an insomnia or/and an excessive sleepiness with a reduction of total sleep time, all combined with an overlap of work period occurring during the habitual sleep time. * The presence of these symptoms has lasted for at least 3 months and are associated with the shift work schedules. * Sleep log or actigraphy monitoring (with sleep diaries) demonstrate for more than 14 days (work and free days included) circadian and sleep-time misalignment. * Sleep disturbance is associated with impairment of social, occupational, and/or other waking functioning. * These symptoms are not better explained by another sleep disorder, medical or neurologic disorder, mental disorder, medication use, poor sleep hygiene, or substance use disorder. = Assessments = There are different tools to assess shift work disorder. Patients can keep a diary. Some questionnaires could be useful as the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire. Actigraphy and polysomnography could indicate some interesting patterns. Further studies are needed to see if some phase markers as the body temperature rhythm or the melatonin rhythm are efficient to assess shift work disorder. Decreased sleep quality may be assessed using the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PQSI).  Treatment  = Prescribed sleep/wake scheduling = Experts agree that there is no such thing as an \\"ideal\\" night work schedule, but some schedules may be better than others. For example, rotating shifts every two weeks in a forward (delaying) direction was found to be easier than rotation in a backward (advancing) direction. Gradual delays (‚Äúnudging‚Äù the circadian system about an hour per day) has been shown in a laboratory setting to maintain synchrony between sleep and the endogenous circadian rhythms, but this schedule is impractical for most real world settings. Some experts have advocated short runs (1 to 2 days) of night work with time for recovery; however, in the traditional heavy industries, longer (5 to 7 day) runs remain the rule. In the end, scheduling decisions usually involve maximizing leisure time, fairness in labor relations, etc. rather than chronobiological considerations. Shift workers can benefit from adhering to sleep hygiene practices related to sleep/wake scheduling. Symptoms typically only fully resolve once a normal sleep schedule is resumed. Many night workers take naps during their breaks, and in some industries, planned napping at work (with facilities provided) is beginning to be accepted. A nap before starting a night shift is a logical prophylactic measure. However, naps that are too long (over 30 minutes) may generate sleep inertia, a groggy feeling after awakening that can impair performance. Therefore, brief naps (10 to 30 minutes) are preferred to longer naps (over 30 minutes). Also, long naps may interfere with the main sleep period. In the transportation industry, safety is a major concern, and mandated hours of service rules attempt to enforce rest times. = Bright light treatment = The light-dark cycle is the most important environmental time cue for entraining circadian rhythms of most species, including humans, and bright artificial light exposure has been developed as a method to improve circadian adaptation in night workers. The timing of bright light exposure is critical for its phase shifting effects. To maximize a delay of the body clock, bright light exposure should occur in the evening or first part of the night, and bright light should be avoided in the morning. Wearing dark goggles (avoiding bright light) or blue-blocking goggles during the morning commute home from work can improve circadian adaptation. For workers who want to use bright light therapy, appropriate fixtures of the type used to treat winter depression are readily available but patients need to be educated regarding their appropriate use, especially the issue of timing. Bright light treatment is not recommended for patients with light sensitivity or ocular disease. = Melatonin treatment = Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland in darkness, normally at night. Its production is suppressed by light exposure, principally blue light around 460 to 480 nm. Light restriction, or dark therapy, in the hours before bedtime allows its production. Dark therapy does not require total darkness. Amber or orange colored goggles eliminate blue light to the eyes while allowing vision. Melatonin is also available as an oral supplement. In the US and Canada, the hormone melatonin is not classified as a drug; it is sold as a dietary supplement. In other countries, it requires a prescription or is unavailable. Although it is not licensed by the FDA as a treatment for any disorder, there have been no serious side effects or complications reported to date. Melatonin has been shown to accelerate the adaptation of the circadian system to a nighttime work schedule. Melatonin may benefit daytime sleep in night workers by an additional direct sleep promoting mechanism. Melatonin treatment may increase sleep length during both daytime and nighttime sleep in night shift workers. = Medications that promote alertness = Caffeine is the most widely used alerting drug in the world and has been shown to improve alertness in simulated night work. Caffeine and naps before a night shift reduces sleepiness during the shift. Modafinil and armodafinil are non-amphetamine alerting drugs originally developed for the treatment of narcolepsy that have been approved by the FDA (the US Food and Drug Administration) for excessive sleepiness associated with SWSD. = Medications that promote daytime sleep = Obtaining enough sleep during the day is a major problem for many night workers. Hypnotics given in the morning can lengthen daytime sleep; however, some studies have shown that nighttime sleepiness may be unaffected. Zopiclone has been shown to be ineffective in increasing sleep in shift workers.

Its name is derived from the Latin Summus portus. It was one of the most popular routes for soldiers, merchants, and pilgrims to the tomb of St. James following the route from Arles to cross the Pyrenees. They travelled from Oloron-Sainte-Marie, Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques, France, via Somport to Aragon, Spain. Military history There is recorded evidence of both the Vandals and the Visigothic invaders having used the relatively easy entrance to Spain from France in the fifth century. The Roman road constructed here, known as the Via Tolosana, was also used by Muslim invaders in the eighth century in their attempt to conquer France. The pass was fortified in the 16th century by the Habsburgs in fear of French invasion, which however would not occur until the Peninsular War and the arrival of Napoleon's general Louis Gabriel Suchet in 1808. He was later followed by Colonel Leonard Morin who records in his Memoirs of the 5th Regiment (1812‚Äì13) both the danger of the pass and the horrible existence of the population of Canfranc. The French would leave by the same road after their defeat by General Francisco Espoz y Mina in 1814. The Fort du Portalet is a fort in the Aspe valley north of the present Spain- France border which guards access to the Col du Somport. It was built by order of Louis Philippe I to guard the border of the Pyrenees. Installed against a cliff overlooking the Gave d'Aspe, it faces the path of Masts.http://www.tourisme-aspe.com/fort-du-portalet.html It was begun in 1842 and finished in 1870, replacing an earlier structure a further north. During WWII L√©on Blum, √âdouard Daladier, Paul Reynaud, Georges Mandel and Maurice Gamelin were interned under the Vichy regime.http://www.tourisme- aspe.com/fort-du-portalet.html After the war Philippe P√©tain was imprisoned in the fort from 15 August to 16 November 1945.Williams, 2005, p.512-3 Pilgrimage history This was arguably the most popular Pyrenaic pass for pilgrims on the Way of St. James until the pacification of Navarran and Basque bandits in the 12th century made the relatively easier Roncesvalles road safer for pilgrims. There is little of interest at the pass, except for the modern Ermita del Pilar (1992) and of course the natural beauty of the mountains. From this point to Santiago de Compostela it is approximately 840 km. Modern history The Pau‚ÄìCanfranc railway linking Canfranc, Spain with Pau, France opened to traffic in 1928, connected via the Somport Railway Tunnel which was completed in 1915, and terminating in Spain at the Canfranc International Railway Station. The railway line was closed due to a freight-train accident 27 March 1970. The long Somport Road Tunnel was opened on 7 February 2003, at a cost of ‚Ç¨160 million to Spain and ‚Ç¨91.5 million for France. The building of the road tunnel was controversial, particularly in France, with those opposing it claiming that it would effectively destroy the natural beauty of the Aspe Valley (Vall√©e d'Aspe), preferring full reopening of the Pau-Canfranc rail line. A group of protesters permanently squatted at the abandoned railway station near Cette-Eygun, at the foot of the pass on the French side. Among them was the charismatic Eric P√©t√©tin, who had waged a protracted legal campaign against the authorities, causing delay in the tunnel's construction. By 1998 protesters were resorting to non-violent direct action, when construction was well under way. Their mascot was the rare Pyrenean Brown Bear, allegedly still to be found in the valley, but close to extinction, and alleged further threatened by the tunnel project. The last protesters were finally evicted in October 2005, some 20 years after campaigning against the tunnel had begun. On 3 June 2003 French deputy Jean Lassalle interrupted the French National Assembly by singing the \\"love song\\" Se Canto, protesting against Minister of the Interior Nicolas Sarkozy's announcement of the moving of 23 gendarmes guarding the Somport Road Tunnel to the town of Oloron-Sainte- Marie from neighbouring Urdos, where Sarkozy commented that their wives had probably been \\"bored\\". Lassalle viewed this as offensive to the residents of Urdos. Sports There is a cross-country ski trail that goes 35 km around the pass, shared by Spain and France. Part of the route belongs to the Spanish ski resort of Candanch√∫.

The house was built in West Palm Beach, Florida in 1905 by some of Henry Flagler's hotel construction workers. Originally known as \\"Gatekeeper's Cottage\\", the house was home to the groundskeeper of Woodlawn Cemetery. By 1920, the house became privately owned by Karl Riddle, a city manager and superintendent of West Palm Beach. He is the namesake of the house. The house was eventually dismantled and moved to Yesteryear Village in 1995, a historical park within the South Florida Fairgrounds. The building was featured in an episode of Ghost Adventures in 2008. History The Riddle House in 1920 The Riddle House was built in 1905 by the constructors of Henry Flagler's hotels, using leftover wood. Originally located at 327 Acacia Street in West Palm Beach, the house was nicknamed \\"the painted lady\\", because of its bright colors. The Riddle House was originally a funeral parlor, known as \\"Gatekeeper's Cottage\\", at Woodlawn Cemetery, which was the first cemetery in the city of West Palm Beach. It was acquired by Karl Riddle in 1920, who is the namesake of the house. Riddle was the first city manager and superintendent of public works of West Palm Beach. He and his twin brother Kenyon later built houses on a property just outside the city in 1935. This area would later become incorporated as Cloud Lake in 1951, after a vote by residents. Later, the house was scheduled for demolition, to make way for the expansion of Palm Beach Atlantic University. However, the city of West Palm Beach instead donated the building to John Riddle, nephew of Karl Riddle. John was then serving as chairman of the Yesteryear Village committee of the South Florida Fair board of directors. Between August 12 and August 13 of 1995, the Riddle House was dismantled and moved to the Yesteryear Village. The roof and attic were split in two, as was the first and second floors. Finally, the building was transported to Yesteryear Village and was reassembled, where it remains to this day. Haunting legend According to legend, the house is haunted by the spirit of Joseph, (one of Riddle's employees) who committed suicide by hanging in the attic to escape his financial troubles. Commercial \\"ghost tours\\" are conducted by Yesteryear Village where guides dressed in period costumes tell stories of their own supposedly paranormal experiences in the building. The house was also featured in 2008 on the ghost-hunting paranormal television series Ghost Adventures on the Travel Channel. War Party Paranormal, a paranormal group based in South East Florida, began paranormal investigations with the historical ghost tours from September 2019.

In the early part of the Goryeo period (918‚Äì1392), these minorities were largely settled in fixed communities. However, the Mongol invasion left Korea in disarray and anomie, and these groups became nomadic. Other subgroups of the baekjeong were the ‚Äòchaein‚Äô and the ‚Äòhwachae‚Äô. The baekjeong occupied specific professions like butchery, tanning, basket weaving and performing executions. During the Goryeo period, \\"baekjeong\\" was used as a neutral term to refer to the common people. From the time of the Joseon dynasty, it became an insulting title used to refer to the lowest class of society. In addition, since the Joseon dynasty, the \\"baekjeong\\" has been also used to denigrate a person. In contemporary South Korea, the term is mainly associated with the meaning of a butcher and even used in the restaurants' names.  Origin  There is a theory that they had migrated from Tartar. The term 'Tartar' seems to have been a general term for all northern peoples, Mongols, Manchurians, and so on. This theory is based on the writings of Jeong Yakyong, who was one of the most distinguished scholars on the methodology of historical researches in the reign of King Jeongjo (1777-1800) and King Sunjo (1801-1834). In his book, the origin of baekjeong is attributed to a nomadic group from the Goryeo period known as the Yangsuchuk (Hanja: Ê•äÊ∞¥Â∞∫) or Mujari (Korean: Î¨¥ÏûêÎ¶¨). Being an alien people from Tartar, the Yangsuchuk were hardly assimilated into the general population. They were engaged in the making and selling of willow baskets. They were also proficient in slaughtering animals and had a liking for hunting, which was frowned upon by the Buddhist society of the Goryeo Dynasty.  History  = In the Goryeo period = From the Goryeo Dynasty (918~1392) until the time of King Sejong of the Joseon Dynasty, baekjeong was not a title to refer to the lowest class of people. The term baekjeong itself means \\"common people. The scholars assume that the baekjeong is \\"a person who have no burden of duties(Ïó≠, ÂΩπ)\\" based on \\"Goryosa\\". It consists of \\"baek\\"(Korean: Î∞±, Hanja: ÁôΩ), which means 'white/innocent/blank', and \\"jeong(Korean: Ï†ï, Hanja: ‰∏Å)\\", or \\"person, man\\". As such, baekjeong, \\"blank man,\\" connotes a group of peasants who have not been granted land because they have not received certain duties from the state. But they also existed as the lowest class of people. In the Goryeo period, the names calling them were 'yangsuchuk (hanja: Ê•äÊ∞¥Â∞∫)', 'suchuk (hanja: Ê∞¥Â∞∫)', 'hawchuck (hanja: Á¶æÂ∞∫)' and 'mujari (Korean: Î¨¥ÏûêÎ¶¨, lit. \\"placeless\\")'. They had been a descendant of the Jurchen or Khitans since the beginning of Koryo. These lowest worship groups liked the group life among themselves, so they continued to live in a temporary residence while moving to various areas. they were distributed nationwide, especially in Pyeongan-do and Hwanghae-do provinces. They were not registered in the national register. = In the Joseon period = After the Goryeo period, Joseon was founded. In the early days of the founding of the Joseon Dynasty, King Sejong consolidated 'yangsucheok', 'sucheok', 'hawcheok' and 'mujari' with ordinary farmers. Therefore, the title calling them became 'Baekjeong', which is the general peasant group in the Goryeo period. King Sejong also put them on the family register, gave them lands to plant and settled them into farmers, and tried to keep them under state control. However, the common policies of King Sejong could not succeed because the ordinary people continued to do so and discriminated against it. Even government officials did not follow the instructions of the king. On the other hand, it seems that the baekjeong did not change their existing lifestyle or occupation easily. They settled in one area and did not try to farm, but they lived and worked in certain jobs, such as making and selling wicker products, slaughtering, singing and dancing. In this situation, the exchange and integration with the baekjeong and the ordinary peasants was not easy, and the practice of discrimination and suppression against the white cane continued. In particular, the mainstream group regarded the life and customs of the butchers as despicable, antisocial, non-normative, and even potential criminal groups. = End of the Joseon Dynasty = Near the end of the Joseon Dynasty, a mutual aid organization for the baekjeong was established, called Seungdongdoga (Korean: ÏäπÎèôÎèÑÍ∞Ä, hanja: ÊâøÊ¥ûÈÉΩÂÆ∂), with representatives from various communities. The organization was involved in taking actions, coordinating improvements, and acting at times as the official representative of the baekjeong in legal matters. In 1894, the system of cadets was legally abolished by the Gopal reform. However, social discrimination against the baekjeong was not lost. The family register of baekjeong was still separate, and it was marked by the use of the word \\"ÊÆ∫Êº¢ (killing the beast)\\" or the red dot. Nonetheless, the Gapo reform ensured that baekjeong could become an official, an asset, a scholar or an artist if they had the ability. Although still largely limited to their traditional occupations, modified regulations in 1896 allowed non-baekjeong to become licensed butchers, eventually leading to meat businesses which have pressured many out of one of the few tasks allowed them. However, while changes to improve the baekjeong's social status was slow, commoners (the lower of the yangmins), who had economically been little different from slaves, was already meaningless as the respect for the government in the 17th century as they fled from the invading Japanese and Manchurians, leaving the civilians at their mercy. The government also awarded many militiamen yangban class status in exchange for their voluntary militia activities against these invaders. In time, with the rise of commerce, merchants bought forged family histories and official status documents as well. Eventually, around three fourths of the population were yangban in name. = Modern = The term \\"baekjeong\\" still remains in modern Korean society. This is particularly common in occupations dealing with raw meat. When someone choose a job to deal with raw meat, they sometimes encounter severe objections. But at the same time, there is also a restaurant that uses the word \\"baekjeong\\". This is also an example of the fact that the butcher is not used as a word to disparage others.  Jobs  =Executioner= Throughout much of the Joseon Dynasty, they were also forced to serve as executioners. When the baekjeong community were called upon to supply an executioner, the job was assigned to some hapless member, sometimes practically an insane person. =Butcher= The baekjeong did jobs that no self-respecting Buddhist Korean would touch, including anything working with animals. Slaughtering animals; leather making; these kinds of dirty duties were avoided by Koreans, and so were filled de facto by baekjeong. In other words, the group was assigned to the most demeaning tasks in Korean society. They were also considered in moral violation of Buddhist principles, which led Koreans to see work involving meat as polluting and sinful, even if they saw the consumption as acceptable. By the latter part of the Joseon Dynasty, baekjeong accepted the principles of Confucianism and did not slaughter for three years when their parents died. Discrimination The group had long suffered severe social discrimination in Korean society. The baekjeong were seen as contemptible and polluted people that others feared and avoided meeting. Baekjeong could not live in a roof-tiled house, were not allowed to wear silk clothes or leather shoes, and did not wear a gat(hat). When baekjeong went outside their houses, they had to untie their head and wear paeraengi. Baekjeong had to lower himself in front of a yangin. Baekjeong could not smoke or drink in front of a yangin. Baekjeong could not ride a litter or horse when they married, and a married woman could not wear a hair stick. Baekjeong could not put a last name on their name, nor could they use words in their name like ‰ªÅ, Áæ©, Á¶Æ, Êô∫(Korean: Ïù∏, Ïùò, Ïòà, ÏßÄ). The extent to which they were seen as impure people is well-illustrated in the fact that their bodies were kept in separate graveyards so as not to mingle with those of the yangmin.  Influence of religion  Donghak and Christianity had a lot of influence on the Baekjeong. Both Donghak and Christianity exposed the Baekjeong, and Koreans more generally, to concepts of egalitarianism and social equality. The influence of these religions was then linked to the social movement. = Donghak = Towards the end of the 19th century, there was an increasing impetus on human dignity and liberalization. Of particular importance was the growth of certain religions(Donghak) supportive of change. Donghak, a Korean nationalist religion, wished to end unfair sinbun conventions, and Tonghak peasants had staged an uprising in 1894 in favor of human rights, especially for those low on the social ladder. They also demanded that the baekjeong no longer be forced to wear discriminatory hats and widows be allowed to remarry. Although this uprising was ultimately unsuccessful, it was an important impetus behind the Gabo Reform, and helped to abolish the status structure that had restricted some groups legally. However, the baekjeong had benefited much less from these changes than other groups, such as the slaves. = Christianity = The other major religious influence on human rights came through Christianity. Some missionaries had converted baekjeong to Christianity, stating that everyone has equal rights under God. However, everyone was not equal under the Christian congregation, and protests erupted when missionaries attempted to integrate them into worship services, with non-baekjeong finding such attempts insensitive to traditional notions of social status. Thus, both Donghak and Christianity exposed the baekjeong, and Koreans more generally, to concepts of egalitarianism and social equality. Parallel to and supportive of the rise of these ideas were transitions occurring in Korean society as a whole, particularly with regard to social classes. Social movements Beginning in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the baekjeong began to resist the open social discrimination that existed against them. In 1900, leaders from 16 counties petitioned the mayor of Jinju to wear the same clothes and hats as other people. When others in the north refused to wear the humiliating garb traditionally expected of them and were jailed, an effort was made to release them. Growing industrialism in Korea began to erode baekjeong dominance over certain occupations, particularly as the Japanese began to control slaughterhouses and exploit them as employees. However, as some baekjeong fell into financial despair, the loosening of segregation led others to profit from changes, giving them the ability to fund efforts for change. Beyond financial resources, organization was also strengthened due to the longstanding connections created through segregation and close-knit social networks. Between these human and financial resources, an emphasis on progressive models, and feelings of social deprivation and discrimination, the conditions were ripe for the baekjeong to mobilize for change. One of the earliest of these movements was in 1910 when Chang Chip'il, later an influential member of the Hyeongpyeongsa, attempted to unsuccessfully establish a trade union for butchers. In 1921, the Jipseong Johap was established by Korean and Japanese entrepreneurs, attempting to provide poverty assistance for butchers. However, this effort for improvement of economic conditions was soon overshadowed by an organization with broader goals. The Hyeongpyeongsa was launched in Jinju on 23 April 1923 through the alliance of wealthy or educated baekjeong and non- baekjeong proponents of change, advocating for \\"the abolition of classes and of contemptuous appellations, the enlightenment of members, and the promotion of mutual friendship among members.\\" It advocated both for individual civil rights as well as communal fellowship, recognizing that the group must maintain its identity under the strain of changes such as urbanization and industrialization which threatened to atomize the community. Thus, the Hyeongpyeongsa pursued both an equality of human rights and the right to assimilate into the broader public, even as it worked to forge a common identity. In 1927 a number of members of the Hyeongpyeongsa were arrested for their involvement in the creation of an underground nationalist organization. Their absence was partially responsible for the organization's shift to the socialist left in the late 1920s. Power within the organization shifted several times, including the shift in 1925 from the original Chinju faction advocating educational reform to a group of Seoul intellectuals more interested in economic reforms based around traditional occupations. At the 1931 national conference, they stirred controversy within the movement by introducing a dissolution proposal, feeling that the organization had abandoned its original aims in favor of those of the bourgeois intellectuals directing it. It was their belief that dissolution would better serve their interests as it was replaced by trade unions. The dissolution proposal failed, but not without further alienating more conservative members of the movement, who were already financially strapped from broader economic conditions in Korea. Even more fatal for the movement was the arrest of a number of young radical members, who were accused of establishing a secret communist organization, the \\"Hyeongpyeongsa Youth Vanguard\\", which authorities said demanded struggle against feudalism and the abolishment of private property. The trial related to this accusation dragged on for four years, before the defendants were found to be innocent. It appears likely that the \\"organization\\" was a construction by Japanese authorities to ensure the labor wing of the Hyeongpyeongsa would not interfere with their access to leather needed for the invasion of China. As a result, the Hyeongpyeongsa shifted to the right, abandoning progressive ideals and finally disbanding in 1935, claiming the movement's aims had successfully been met. The growing power of the radical wing divided the movement, and much of the economic support provided by wealthier baekjeong was pulled, particularly under the strain of the Great Depression, which had negatively impacted the meat and leather trades. The young socialists in the Hy≈èngp'y≈èngsa forged connections with other movements, attempting to broaden the movement and work towards \\"the reconstitution of Korea as a whole.\\" More importantly, they focused on social and economic injustices affecting the baekjeong, hoping to create an egalitarian Korean society. Their efforts included attacking social discrimination by the upper class, authorities, and \\"commoners\\" and the use of degrading language against children in public schools.

Fixtures are used to securely locate (position in a specific location or orientation) and support the work, ensuring that all parts produced using the fixture will maintain conformity and interchangeability. Using a fixture improves the economy of production by allowing smooth operation and quick transition from part to part, reducing the requirement for skilled labor by simplifying how workpieces are mounted, and increasing conformity across a production run. A fixture differs from a jig in that when a fixture is used, the tool must move relative to the workpiece; a jig moves the piece while the tool remains stationary. Purpose A fixture's primary purpose is to create a secure mounting point for a workpiece, allowing for support during operation and increased accuracy, precision, reliability, and interchangeability in the finished parts. It also serves to reduce working time by allowing quick set-up, and by smoothing the transition from part to part. It frequently reduces the complexity of a process, allowing for unskilled workers to perform it and effectively transferring the skill of the tool maker to the unskilled worker. Fixtures also allow for a higher degree of operator safety by reducing the concentration and effort required to hold a piece steady. Economically speaking the most valuable function of a fixture is to reduce labor costs. Without a fixture, operating a machine or process may require two or more operators; using a fixture can eliminate one of the operators by securing the workpiece. Design These modular fixture components may be built into various arrangements to accommodate different workpieces Fixtures should be designed with economics in mind; the purpose of these devices is often to reduce costs, and so they should be designed in such a way that the cost reduction outweighs the cost of implementing the fixture. It is usually better, from an economic standpoint, for a fixture to result in a small cost reduction for a process in constant use, than for a large cost reduction for a process used only occasionally. Most fixtures have a solid component, affixed to the floor or to the body of the machine and considered immovable relative to the motion of the machining bit, and one or more movable components known as clamps. These clamps (which may be operated by many different mechanical means) allow workpieces to be easily placed in the machine or removed, and yet stay secure during operation. Many are also adjustable, allowing for workpieces of different sizes to be used for different operations. Fixtures must be designed such that the pressure or motion of the machining operation (usually known as the feed) is directed primarily against the solid component of the fixture. This reduces the likelihood that the fixture will fail, interrupting the operation and potentially causing damage to infrastructure, components, or operators. Fixtures may also be designed for very general or simple uses. These multi-use fixtures tend to be very simple themselves, often relying on the precision and ingenuity of the operator, as well as surfaces and components already present in the workshop, to provide the same benefits of a specially-designed fixture. Examples include workshop vises, adjustable clamps, and improvised devices such as weights and furniture. Each component of a fixture is designed for one of two purposes: location or support. =Location= Locating components ensure the geometrical stability of the workpiece. They make sure that the workpiece rests in the correct position and orientation for the operation by addressing and impeding all the degrees of freedom the workpiece possesses. For locating workpieces, fixtures employ pins (or buttons), clamps, and surfaces. These components ensure that the workpiece is positioned correctly, and remains in the same position throughout the operation. Surfaces provide support for the piece, pins allow for precise location at low surface area expense, and clamps allow for the workpiece to be removed or its position adjusted. Locating pieces tend to be designed and built to very tight specifications. =Support= In designing the locating parts of a fixture, only the direction of forces applied by the operation are considered, and not their magnitude. Locating parts technically support the workpiece, but do not take into account the strength of forces applied by the process and so are usually inadequate to actually secure the workpiece during operation. For this purpose, support components are used. To secure workpieces and prevent motion during operation, support components primarily use two techniques: positive stops and friction. A positive stop is any immovable component (such as a solid surface or pin) that, by its placement, physically impedes the motion of the workpiece. Support components are more likely to be adjustable than locating components, and normally do not press tightly on the workpiece or provide absolute location. Support components usually bear the brunt of the forces delivered during the operation. To reduce the chances of failure, support components are usually not also designed as clamps. Types of fixtures Fixtures are usually classified according to the machine for which they were designed. The most common two are milling fixtures and drill fixtures. =Milling fixtures= Milling operations tend to involve large, straight cuts that produce many chips and involve varying force. Locating and supporting areas must usually be large and very sturdy in order to accommodate milling operations; strong clamps are also a requirement. Due to the vibration of the machine, positive stops are preferred over friction for securing the workpiece. For high-volume automated processes, milling fixtures usually involve hydraulic or pneumatic clamps. =Drilling fixtures= Drilling fixtures cover a wider range of different designs and procedures than milling fixtures. Though workholding for drills is more often provided by jigs, fixtures are also used for drilling operations. Two common elements of drilling fixtures are the hole and bushing. Holes are often designed into drilling fixtures, to allow space for the drill bit itself to continue through the workpiece without damaging the fixture or drill, or to guide the drill bit to the appropriate point on the workpiece. Bushings are simple bearing sleeves inserted into these holes to protect them and guide the drill bit. Because drills tend to apply force in only one direction, support components for drilling fixtures may be simpler. If the drill is aligned pointing down, the same support components may compensate for the forces of both the drill and gravity at once. However, though monodirectional, the force applied by drills tends to be concentrated on a very small area. Drilling fixtures must be designed carefully to prevent the workpiece from bending under the force of the drill.

Along with James Russell, she is the founding editor-in-chief of the journal Emotion Review.Emotion Review Barrett received the 2019 Guggenheim Fellowship in neuroscience, and a 2007 NIH Director's Pioneer Award to study how the brain creates emotion. Biography Barrett was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, to a working poor family and was the first member of her extended family to attend university. After graduating from the University of Toronto with honors, she pursued a Ph.D. in clinical psychology at the University of Waterloo with the goal of becoming a therapist, until a frustrating puzzle sidetracked her from a clinical career. As a graduate student, she failed eight times to replicate a simple experiment, finally realizing that her seeming failed attempts were, in fact, successfully replicating a previously undiscovered phenomenon. The resulting research direction became her life's work: understanding the nature of emotion in the brain. Following a clinical internship at the University of Manitoba Medical School, she held professorships in psychology at Penn State University, Boston College, and Northeastern University. Over two decades, she transitioned from clinical psychology into social psychology, psychophysiology, cognitive science, and cognitive neuroscience. Barrett is most inspired by William James, Wilhelm Wundt, and Charles Darwin. In 2019‚Äì2020, she served as president of the Association for Psychological Science. In 2020, she was ranked in the top one percent of the most-cited scientists in the world over a ten-year period.

Professional history =Study of human emotions= At the beginning of her career, Barrett's research focused on the structure of affect, having developed experience-sampling methods and open-source software to study emotional experience. Barrett and members at the Interdisciplinary Affective Science Laboratory (IASL) study the nature of emotion broadly from social- psychological, psychophysiological, cognitive science, and neuroscience perspectives, and take inspiration from anthropology, philosophy, and linguistics. They also explore the role of emotion in vision and other psychological phenomena. In 1996, she joined the Psychology Faculty at Boston College. Before that she was an assistant professor of clinical psychology at The Pennsylvania State University. Her research has focused on the main issues in the science of emotions such as: *What are the basic building blocks of emotional life? *Why is it that people quickly and effortlessly perceive anger, sadness, fear in themselves and others, yet scientists have been unable to specify a set of clear criteria for empirically identifying these emotional events? *What roles do language and conceptual knowledge play in emotion perception? *Are there really differences between the emotional lives of men and women? (see ) =Theory of constructed emotion= During her graduate training, Barrett developed the initial insights for her current theory of constructed emotion. She highlights differences in emotions between different cultures (see Emotions and culture), and says that emotions \\"are not triggered; you create them. They emerge as a combination of the physical properties of your body, a flexible brain that wires itself to whatever environment it develops in, and your culture and upbringing, which provide that environment.\\"How Emotions Are Made, 2017, IntroductionJoseph LeDoux has taken a similar view.

Its goals were to research, reassess and reduce the influence of the military in US economics and politics. Its founder chairman was Harold Willens, president of the Factory Equipment Supply Corporation, who had also founded the Business Executives Move for Vietnam Peace in 1967. Willens had been a captain in the US Marines during the Second World War and then became successful as a businessman afterwards. The organization was funded by donations and dues which were $100 for individuals up to $25,000 for the 17 founder members who helped Willens start the organization. Its staff included A. Ernest Fitzgerald ‚Äì the whistleblower who testified about the problems with the Lockheed C-5A and was fired from the USAF's Senior Executive Service on the orders of President Nixon, resulting in the case of Nixon v. Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald produced literature and conducted a program of seminars across the country on the topic of waste in the military. The BEF sent out a letter by General David M. Shoup, the former Commandant of the Marine Corps who was critical of the US foreign policy at that time, calling it \\"militaristic and aggressive\\". This was sent to 25,000 senior executives across the nation and 1,700 responses were received. The majority of these agreed with the general's statement but the executives did not want to say so publicly. Willens found this discouraging, considering that the business community was too cautious and conformist, \\"Corporate executives are acting in accordance with an established set of priorities, including being popular, fashionable, promoted and invited to the White House.\\" The group was put on to the original Nixon's Enemies List and the master list of Nixon political opponents for bankrolling a syndicated 5-minute radio program considered negative toward the Nixon administration.

He has served as the captain of Collingwood since the 2014 season. In round 18 of the 2020 season, he broke the Collingwood record for most VFL/AFL games played, as well as most games as captain.  Early life  Originally from Sale in the Gippsland Region of Victoria, Pendlebury began his sporting career playing basketball and accepted a scholarship to the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra, however, after 3 weeks at the AIS, he decided to quit the Under 18's squad and return to Victoria to pursue professional football with the Gippsland Power in the TAC Cup. In an interesting twist of fate, Pendlebury's vacated place in the AIS squad was taken by Patty Mills, who went on to win an NBA Championship in 2014 with the San Antonio Spurs.http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/when-came-calling- scott-pendlebury/story-e6frf9jf-1226145977257 Growing up, Pendlebury supported the Melbourne Football Club. Pendlebury was selected for the 2005 Under-18 Vic Country team. He played two of the three games and had an average of 17 possessions. He was selected to play for eventual 2005 TAC Cup premiers Gippsland Power. He played 19 games, kicked 11 goals and averaged 22 possessions a game. Collingwood became aware of Pendlebury after Gippsland Power manager Peter Francis recommended both Pendlebury and his older brother Kristopher. Alt URL Collingwood drafted Scott Pendlebury with pick five in the 2005 AFL Draft, and Collingwood's number two pick overall, whereas Kris did not play in the AFL but did captain the Collingwood side in the Victorian Football League.Senior Pendlebury eyeing AFL AFL career Pendlebury began his career wearing number 16 on his guernsey and changed to number 10 at the start of the 2007 season. He is a natural left-footer, rarely wastes a possession, and has excellent vision that has been attributed to his years playing basketball. =2006= Pendlebury's 2006 pre-season was hampered by glandular fever, but he made a successful comeback with Collingwood's VFL affiliate, Williamstown. He made his AFL debut in Round 10 against the Brisbane Lions, and became part of a select group of footballers known for kicking their first goal with their first kick in league football. He played eight more games in the 2006 season. =2007= Pendlebury switched to the number 10 guernsey previously worn by Blake Caracella, and gave the number 16 guernsey to newcomer Nathan Brown. Following his nine games in 2006, Pendlebury broke into the Collingwood midfield on a regular basis, averaging 18 disposals a game before he was nominated for the NAB Rising Star in Round 4. He collected a season-high 26 possessions in the 2007 Semi-Final against the West Coast Eagles in Perth, and kicked a crucial goal during extra time. Throughout the 2007 season, he was compared with Geelong rookie midfielder Joel Selwood. Both were close favourites for the 2007 NAB Rising Star with Selwood eventually winning by seven votes. Pendlebury also placed second in the 2007 Copeland Trophy behind Travis Cloke. =2008= Pendlebury was voted into Collingwood's five-man leadership group as deputy vice-captain preceding the 2008 season. Highlights of Pendlebury's season included 33 disposals against Essendon on ANZAC Day and placing a close second behind Paul Medhurst for the Anzac Day medal. On 9 May 2008, Pendlebury was selected in the Victorian Squad for the AFL Hall of Fame Tribute Match, with teammates Josh Fraser and Heath Shaw. Despite playing only half of the match, he collected 19 disposals with a 79% efficiency rating. Pendlebury was an important factor in Collingwood's 86-point victory over reigning premiers Geelong. Pendlebury played his 50th game on 9 August 2008 against St Kilda in Round 19. He finished third in Collingwood's 2008 Best and Fairest count. =2009= Pendlebury became more prominent in 2009. He collected a career high 39 disposals against Melbourne Football Club on the Queens Birthday and won the Women's Round medal. He had a career high 22 kicks against the West Coast Eagles and another career high 20 handballs against the Richmond Football Club. Despite missing a few games due to injuries, he was still shortlisted for selection as an All-Australian. He had an average of 26 disposals a game (13 kicks and 13 handballs)and averaged 2 goals per 5 games. His season ended with a cracked fibula bone injury in the Qualifying final. Pendlebury polled 13 votes in the 2009 Brownlow Medal, the top ranked Collingwood player. =2010= In 2010 Pendlebury won a spot in the All-Australian teamHayes left out of All-Oz team and won the ANZAC Medal. He polled 21 votes in the 2010 Brownlow Medal, to finish in fourth position.Judd charges to medal No.2 He won the 2010 Norm Smith medal when Collingwood won the premiership. =2011= In 2011 Pendlebury won his second ANZAC Day Medal as best-on-ground in Collingwood's 30-point win over . Three weeks later, against , he was controversially denied a goal from a free kick that would have won Collingwood the game. Ultimately, the Magpies lost by three points. He capped off a brilliant year, winning the Copeland Trophy for the best and fairest player at Collingwood, and the Bob Rose Trophy for being the best Collingwood player throughout the finals. In the Brownlow he polled 24 votes to finish equal third behind winner Dane Swan, Sam Mitchell (disqualified) and Nick Dal Santo. =2012= Pendlebury finished the season with 15 brownlow votes, down on his 24 from the previous year and helped the Magpies to a Preliminary Final, where they eventually lost to the Sydney Swans. He finished second in the Copeland Trophy to winner Dayne Beams and in front of three-time champion Dane Swan. He was also included in the All Australian for the 3rd year running alongside teammates Swan and Dayne Beams. =2013= Pendlebury improved on his 2012 season, having arguably his best and most consistent season to date. Already touted as future captain of the Collingwood Football Club, Pendlebury helped lead the club brilliantly in 2013 and although Collingwood lost the Elimination final loss to Port Adelaide, Pendlebury won his second Copeland Trophy beating former champion Dane Swan. He also had 21 votes in the Brownlow, only losing out to teammate Dane Swan for the highest votes for the Magpies. Pendlebury once again was included in the All Australian Squad being named on the wing. This was his fourth consecutive inclusion in the team. =2014= On 29 January, Pendlebury was appointed as captain replacing Nick Maxwell. Pendlebury has thrived as captain having one of his best seasons. At the end of the season, Pendlebury was selected for the fifth consecutive time as part of the All Australian team and was awarded the Lou Richards Medal. He also won his third Copeland Trophy, the Magpie Army Player of the Year award and the Gavin Brown Award. =2015= During the 2015 Copeland Trophy event, Eddie McGuire announced that Pendlebury had re-signed with Collingwood until the end of 2020. Pendlebury said at event \\"The direction the club is taking really excites me. We have a solid group of young players who have got a taste of senior footy and we have the right program and people in place to take this group to the next level. I‚Äôm proud to captain this club and want to be part of what the future holds.\\" The same night, he won his third consecutive Copeland Trophy and fourth overall. =2016= Pendlebury battled injury early in the season as well as filled in as a half-back instead of his regular role in the midfield, and despite this maintained his consistency. His professionalism and inspiration caused his peers to vote for him as the winner of the Gavin Brown Award for demonstrating the team values throughout the season. He was further rewarded with his fourth consecutive Copeland Trophy and fifth overall. =2017= Pendlebury had a consistent 2017 season until he sustained a broken finger in Round 17 against the Gold Coast Suns. He had successful surgery on the finger, and was hopeful to return the next week, but his return was delayed for a month and it was said to be unlikely that he would play again until Round 22 or 23. However, did not return again for the season. In the 2017 season, he averaged a career high tackles per game (6.4). Personal life Pendlebury was born and raised in Sale, Victoria. He attended Catholic College Sale. He played alongside former Collingwood players Dale Thomas, Tyson Goldsack and Brent Macaffer at the Gippsland Power before all getting drafted to Collingwood. He has two brothers who have both played football in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Older brother Kris has won the Joseph Wren Memorial Trophy and captained the Collingwood VFL Football Club and younger brother Ryan has played for three teams in the VFL. Scott Pendlebury married his long-term girlfriend, Alex Pendlebury(n√©e Davis) in 2016. The couple's first child Jax was born in 2017, and welcomed a daughter named Darcy Rose in November, 2019.

It is a high cut including the bone, to be cooked on the embers or on the grill, with a degree of \\"blood\\" cooking (\\"al sangue\\").  History  Corrado Tedeschi, Florentine leader of the Italian Nettist Party, promised during 1953 general elections to deliver a daily supply of steak to every citizen The history of the Florentine steak is as old as the Italian city of Florence, from which it takes its name, and the tracks of its origins are lost in time. However, its tradition, celebrity, and name can be traced back to the celebration of the feast of Saint Lawrence on 10 August and to the House of Medici. On the occasion of the Festa di San Lorenzo the city was illuminated by the light of large bonfires, where large quantities of veal were roasted and then distributed to the population. Florence at the time of the Medici was an important crossroad where you could meet travelers from all over the world. It is said that on the occasion of the Feast of Saint Lawrence, some English knights were present at the celebrations and were offered the meat roasted on the fires. They called it in their language beef steak referring to the type of meat they were eating. From here a translation adapted to the current Italian language created the word bistecca that has come down to the present day. An alternative version dates it back to the English, present in Florence in the 19th century, who left their mark on Tuscan cuisine. These were wealthy people, who could also afford cuts of fine meat, such as beef steak, precisely, but also as the roast beef, also present in Florentine cuisine. In the 1950s Florentine publisher Corrado Tedeschi founded the Italian Nettist Party, better known as the Steak Party (Partito della Bistecca). Considered a forerunner of anti-politics or the first Italian satirical party, the Steak Party took part in the 1953 Italian general election using the motto \\"Better a steak today than an empire tomorrow\\", promising to give people a 450 g steak every day.  Definition  The area of the sirloin and the rib, from which the cut of meat derives. The Florentine steak is obtained from the cut of the sirloin (the part corresponding to the lumbar vertebrae, the half of the back on the side of the tail) of the calf of the Chianina breed: in the middle it has the \\"T\\" shaped bone, in fact it is also called T-bone steak, with the fillet on one side and the sirloin on the other. The italian gastronomist Pellegrino Artusi, in his cooking manual Science in the Kitchen and the Art of Eating Well (La scienza in cucina e l'arte di mangiar bene), defines the cut of the steak as follows: \\"Florentine steak. From beef-steak, an English word that is worth the rib of an ox, came the name of our steak, which is nothing more than a chop with its bone, a finger or a finger and a half thick, cut from the sirloin of veal\\". According to Corrado Tedeschi, founder of the Steak Party, \\"to be truly such, a beefsteak must weigh at least 450 grams. If it weighs a kilo, so much the better. But no less than a 450 grams, because otherwise it becomes a cutlet and then my party would no longer be the Beefsteak Party.\\"  Preparation  Bistecca alla fiorentina The meat - previously aged for at least two weeks in cold rooms - must be at room temperature at the time of cooking. The cut is about 1-1.5 kg, the height about 5-6 cm. To heat the barbecue grill, a generous amount of charcoal embers, preferably oak, holm oak or olive, is used. The charcoal must be well alive, barely veiled by a light layer of ash, without flame. Plates, gas grills, electric grills, grills with refractory stone, etc. should be absolutely avoided. The meat must be at first be very close to the coals, so that an aromatic crust is formed as quickly as possible via the Maillard reaction, then after the first minute it must be raised to a gentler heat. Put on top of the meat without seasoning, a fundamental operation to prevent it from hardening, it should be turned once, cooking it about 3-5 minutes per side, no more. Finally, it should be cooked \\"standing\\" on the side of the bone (the steak must be thick enough to stand alone), for 5/7 minutes, no longer, until the traces of blood disappear from the bone (which actually is not blood, but myoglobin, a protein). However, there is another school of cooking that says that meat should not be cooked standing up. A good cooking is the secret of all the taste of this dish: the meat must be colored on the outside and red, soft and juicy on the inside, warm, but not cooked. For this reason it should not be turned with the help of forks or any other kitchen tool that can penetrate the meat and break the crust that forms at the beginning of cooking. Instead, it must be turned, gently pinched, with the use of a suitable tool, as the tool can cause the leakage of precious \\"juices\\" that give flavor to the meat. There is a third way of cooking, called \\"reverse searing\\", consisting of heating the piece of meat (in the barbecue or in a conventional oven) to a temperature of about 50¬∞C at the heart; then place the steak in a grill or pan (preferably in cast iron) previously heated (they must be hot) to create a brown tasty crust using the Maillard reaction. Finally, let the steak rest for 4-5 minutes and then serve, trying to cut against the fiber. Traditional accompaniments are cannellini beans dressed with olive oil, or a salad. It should not be sprinkled with lemon. On the table it goes well with a good red wine, like Chianti classico.

Commonly known as \\"ESM\\", the district serves the hamlets of Manorville and Eastport, as well as portions of the hamlets of Speonk and Mastic. The total enrollment for the 2015-2016 school year is 3,534 students.  History of the District  The school district was formed in 2000 from the merger of two local districts, Eastport Union Free School District (UFSD) in Eastport, and South Manor UFSD in Manorville. These two districts, along with several others, participated in a study in the mid-1990s to determine the feasibility of combining the many local districts into one centralized district. Proponents suggested that this would benefit the schools through lower central administration costs, and would allow significantly better programming for students, since a combined district would have a much higher enrollment than any of the individual districts. Further, the area covered in the scope of the study had experienced significant growth, particularly in Manorville, which had doubled the population in a span of only ten years. Finally, neither South Manor UFSD nor East Moriches UFSD (a nearby district that also participated in the study) had high schools of their own, and were paying costly tuition to send their students to other high schools. Ultimately, only Eastport and South Manor decided to combine to create a new district. The central administration office is located at 149 Dayton Avenue, Manorville, NY 11949. A 2010 survey by Newsday reported that the Eastport-South Manor School District was one of twelve schools on Long Island that was \\"particularly well-run, with well- developed financial policies, effective internal controls, and well-managed operations\\". Before the merger, Eastport's mascot was the Duck, paying tribute to the large local duck farming industry, due to which Eastport was commonly referred to as \\"the duck capital of the world\\". The mascot of the South Manor school district was the Mustang.  Schools in the District  * South Street School (Grades K-2) * Tuttle Avenue Elementary School (Grades K-2) * Dayton Avenue School (Grades 3-6) * Eastport Elementary School (Grades 3 - 6) * Eastport-South Manor Junior/Senior High School (Grades 7-12) Before the two school districts merged, South Street School and Dayton Avenue School were the two schools of South Manor UFSD, serving grades K-9. Eastport Elementary was known as Eastport High School, but served all thirteen grades in one building. It was the only school in the former Eastport UFSD.  Extracurricular Activities  = Theatre = The school district is well known for its excellence in stage productions. The theatre facilities include a black box theatre capable of holding 250 audience members, a main stage theatre with nearly 1000 seats, state-of-the-art lighting and sound equipment, a booth, a lighting catwalk, state of the art rigging system, costume building facilities, dressing rooms, an orchestra pit, and a scene shop. Several shows are put on in the Black Box stage. Two shows are put on a year on the Main Stage. While the shows are performed by students, the level of dedication from all members give students the impression they are working professionally. In the fall there is a ‚Äú5 day play challenge‚Äù, and in the spring, a musical. Many students have also received Teeny Awards in various categories for their performances. In addition, many students pursue careers and further education in theatre, and some have even made it to Broadway. Since opening in 2003 the following shows have been put on: * Moon Over Buffalo * Guys and Dolls * The Laramie Project * Fiddler on the Roof * Rumors * Little Women * The Crucible * South Pacific * Noises Off * Les Miserables * Picnic * Anything Goes * Lend Me a Tenor * Beauty and The Beast * West Side Story * Inherit the Wind * The Music Man * Blithe Spirit * The Sound Of Music * The Diary of Anne Frank * A Chorus Line * The Last Night of Ballyhoo * Little Shop of Horrors * Crimes of the Heart * Mary Poppins * Sylvia * Godspell * The Little Mermaid * Legally Blonde Canceled due to Covid-19 = Sports = The school is also known for its sports program. The school offers (most for both boys and girls): Lacrosse, Cross Country, Volleyball, Football, Basketball, Baseball, Softball, Track, Tennis, Soccer, Golf, Field Hockey, and Bowling. * Eastport-South Manor teams are regularly recognized by Section XI for its top scholar-athletic teams, with many of the teams given the sportsmanship award. * The gymnasium and football field at Eastport-South Manor are affectionately dubbed 'The Shark Tank'. The student section, also known as 'The Shark Pack', provides an incredible atmosphere at varsity games. * In 2015 the Girls Varsity Lacrosse team were Class B state champions. * In 2016, Boys Varsity Volleyball were Class B State Champions. * In 2019, the girls varsity lacrosse team was the state Class B champion. =Clubs= The Eastport-South Manor school district also provides its students with many extracurricular clubs and activities: *Stage Crew *Academic Team Club *Marching Band *Color Guard *History Club *Jazz Band *S.A.D.D.

The ESM community decided to construct a Wall of Honor as a means to express their gratitude to the courageous alumni serving in the United States Armed Forces. This wall is designed to recognize graduates from the first graduation class (2004) to the present. The names of future graduates whom enter the military will also have their names added to the Wall of Honor. In order to support its construction, volunteers raised over $60,000.http://www.27east.com/news/article.cfm/Eastport/410114/Eastport-South- Manor-Students-Want-To-Recognize-Soldiers-With-Wall-of-Honor References  External links  *Eastport-South Manor Central School District *Burton, Behrendt & Smith (BBS) Category:School districts in New York (state) Category:Brookhaven, New York Category:Southampton (town), New York Category:Education in Suffolk County, New York ","title":"Eastport-South Manor Central School District"},{"id":"5633082","text":"Kathleen \\"Kat\\" Kinkade (December 6, 1930 - July 3, 2008) was one of the eight co-founders of Twin Oaks, an intentional community in Virginia originally inspired by the behaviorist utopia depicted in B.F.

Her daughter, Josie, was also a member of Twin Oaks Community as an adolescent and young adult. Career A native of Seattle, Washington, Kinkade helped found Twin Oaks in 1967, when she was in her mid 30s, after a career as a \\"bored secretary\\" and a brief stint at a cooperative house in Washington, D.C. In the 1970s, Kinkade left Twin Oaks to move to Missouri to help found East Wind Community, an offshoot of Twin Oaks. She eventually returned to Twin Oaks, though East Wind continues to this day. In 1993, Kinkade was one of the founders of Acorn Community, her third income- sharing intentional community. Kinkade was also instrumental in founding the network of income-sharing egalitarian communities called The Federation of Egalitarian Communities or the FEC. At age 70, she moved into a small house fifteen miles away in the town of Mineral. In 2008, with metastatic breast cancer, Kinkade was no longer able to care for herself. Twin Oaks took her in to provide end-of-life care for her, an exception made in honor of her unique contribution to the Community.

It is part of the North Shore Railroad System. The line runs generally west between Muncy (in Lycoming County) and Avis (in Clinton County). Other communities served include Montoursville, Williamsport (and its western neighborhood of Newberry), the unincorporated village of Linden (in Woodward Township) and Jersey Shore (all in Lycoming County). of track are in Lycoming County and is in Clinton County. The rail line runs north and then west along the left bank of the West Branch Susquehanna River, roughly following the routes of Interstate 180 and U.S. Route 220. The corporate offices are located in Northumberland, Pennsylvania. There are connections to the Norfolk Southern Railway line at Muncy and Linden (as well as an indirect connection to Canadian Pacific Railway service). The Lycoming County Visitors Bureau offers occasional train excursions, departing from Williamsport and going to either Jersey Shore or Muncy and returning. In the fall these are billed as \\"Fall Foliage Excursions\\" and in December there are Polar Express rides with Santa Claus. The system has trackage rights via the Norfolk Southern line. These allow the Lycoming Valley Railroad to connect to the west with the Nittany and Bald Eagle Railroad (at Lock Haven) and, to the south, with the Union County Industrial Railroad (at Milton), the North Shore Railroad (at Northumberland), and Shamokin Valley Railroad (at Sunbury).  History  Map of the Lycoming Valley Railroad (red) and Norfolk Southern Railway (blue) lines in Lycoming County. The line operated by the Lycoming Valley Railroad (Initials are LVRR) was formerly part of the Reading Company and New York Central Railroad and was absorbed into Conrail. SEDA-COG JRA was formed in July 1983 to continue to provide rail service to communities whose rail lines Conrail had decided to abandon. In 1996 the JRA took over the line when Conrail abandoned it, and the Lycoming Valley Railroad was born as its fifth railroad. Vast stands of timber and nearby coal deposits brought three early railroads to the Williamsport area. In December 1854, the Sunbury & Erie RR, a PRR predecessor, built northward through Williamport. The Catawissa, Williamsport & Erie RR, a Reading predecessor, ran its trains to Williamsport over Sunbury & Erie from 1854 until its own line was constructed 1871. The New York Central presence in the Valley dates from 1883, when its Pine Creek RR opened between Wellsboro and Newberry, to haul coal. All these routes were merged into Conrail in 1976. Purchased by the SEDA-CoG Joint Rail Authority, they have been operated by the Lycoming Valley Railroad Company since August 15, 1996. On September 8, 2011 the railroad bridge over Loyalsock Creek was heavily damaged by flooding. Heavy rain from the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee raised the creek \\"higher than anything we've seen in recorded history\\", according to a Lycoming County official. The damage to the bridge is likely severe enough that the bridge will not be usable. The Loyalsock Creek bridge is in the process of being rebuilt.

Early life Bailey was born in London, the second son of John Bailey (horticulturist and first Colonial Botanist of South Australia) and his wife, n√©e Manson. Frederick was educated at the foundation school of the Independent Church at Hackney, London. The family went to Australia in 1838 arriving at Adelaide on 22 March 1839 in the Buckinghamshire. John Bailey was appointed colonial botanist soon afterwards and was asked to form a botanic garden. John Bailey resigned in 1841, began farming, and subsequently started a plant nursery at Adelaide In these ventures he was assisted by his son, Frederick. Career In 1858 Bailey went to New Zealand and took up land in the Hutt Valley. In 1861 Frederick started a seedsman's business in Brisbane. For some years he was collecting in various parts of Queensland, and he also contributed articles to the newspapers on plant life. Bailey married Anna Maria, eldest daughter of the Rev. T. Waite in 1856. In 1874 Bailey published a Handbook to the Ferns of Queensland, and in the following year was made botanist to the board appointed to investigate diseases of livestock and plants. Consequently, Bailey in 1879 published An Illustrated Monograph of the Grasses of Queensland with Karl Staiger. He was afterwards put in charge of the botanical section of the Queensland Museum, in 1881 was made colonial botanist of Queensland, and held this position until his death. He published in 1881 The Fern World of Australia, and in 1883 appeared A Synopsis of the Queensland Flora, a work of nearly 900 pages to which supplementary volumes were added in later years. This work was superseded by The Queensland Flora, published in six volumes between 1899 and 1902 with an index published three years later. In the meantime, there had been A Companion for the Queensland Student of Plant Life and Botany Abridged (1897), a revised reissue of two earlier pamphlets. Among other works of Bailey was A Catalogue of the Indigenous and Naturalised Plants of Queensland (1890). This was expanded into a Comprehensive Catalogue of Queensland Plants, Both Indigenous and Naturalised (1912), which appeared with many illustrations. Bailey travelled widely, important expeditions included Rockingham Bay, Seaview Range and the upper Herbert River (1873), western Queensland, Roma and Rockhampton (1876), Cairns and the Barron River (1877), Bellenden Ker (1889), Georgina River (1895), Torres Strait (1897) and British New Guinea (1898). Bailey was awarded the Clarke Medal of the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1902, and was created C.M.G. in 1911. Bailey died on 25 June 1915 at Kangaroo Point, Brisbane. He is buried in South Brisbane Cemetery.\\"Inscription for Frederick Manson Bailey\\". Australian Cemeteries Index. Retrieved 18 October 2012. Legacy Frederick Manson Bailey's name has been attached to about 50 species of plants by fellow botanists, such as Acacia baileyana and Grevillea baileyana. A son, John Frederick Bailey, who survived him, was director of the Brisbane and then Adelaide botanic gardens. References *E. N.

He attended Northside High School in Warner Robins, Georgia where he batted .500, and he eventually attended Middle Georgia College. Kal owned the single season home run record at Northside High School for 20 years. In 2000, Trea Brinson broke Kal's record and still holds it to this day. Daniels was drafted by the New York Mets in the third round, 58th overall, of the 1982 amateur entry draft, January Regular Phase. He didn't sign then, but when he was drafted seventh overall by the Cincinnati Reds in the 1982 amateur entry draft, June Secondary Phase, he did. In his first professional season, he hit .367 and stole 27 bases in 67 games. In 1984, his third professional season, Daniels began developing power to go along with his good speed. In 122 games that year, he hit 17 home runs and stole 43 bases. On April 9, 1986, Daniels made his big league debut at 22 years old. He had a successful rookie season, mostly being used off the bench- he hit .320 with 6 home runs and 15 stolen bases in 78 games (181 at-bats). In his second season, Daniels recorded a career high in home-runs per AB, hitting .334 with 26 home runs and 26 stolen bases in only 108 games. After the 1989 season, his numbers dropped off drastically, especially his stolen base totals-this was because he had to undergo a knee surgery (the sixth of his career), that evidently \\"stole\\" his ability to steal bases. In 1990, Daniels remained healthy all season. Although he only stole 4 bases, he hit 27 home runs and collected 94 RBI. He played his final game on September 22, 1992.

The program began when the first National Masters Swimming Championships were held on May 2, 1970 at the Amarillo Aquatic Club pool with a few dozen swimmers. Captain Ransom J. Arthur, M.D., a San Diego Navy doctor, had persuaded John Spannuth, President of American Swimming Coaches Association, that the event would give older swimmers (ex-competitors and beginners) a goal for keeping physically fit. Arthur's mission of encouraging adults to improve fitness through swimming has grown over the years into a nationwide organization that currently includes more than 60,000 adult swimmers. Members participate in a variety of ways ranging from lap swimming to international competition. The program is organized by USMS, which provides organized workouts, competitions, clinics, and workshops for adults aged 18 and over. Programs are open to all adult swimmers (fitness, triathlete, competitive, noncompetitive) who are dedicated to improving their fitness through swimming. To be eligible for USMS competition, swimmers must sign up with USMS and obtain a membership card for a fee that varies by location.  Competition  Although there are more than 500 local and regional competitions around the country that are available for Masters swimmers to participate in, less than half of the members compete in these meets. However, for those that do, there are a variety of events to choose from including pool meets, ePostal swims, and open water swims. Two national championship pool meets are held each year, which help to determine the USMS Top 10‚Äîthe top 10 fastest times in the nation in pool meets that are sanctioned or recognized by USMS during the current season and is organized by age, sex and course. The swimmer with the fastest time in the USMS Top 10 in each age group, event, and course, plus the age group winners of the long distance events are further named to the All-American list. In each age group, the swimmer with the most All-American titles is named an All-Star. All of the results from the competitions, as well as a record of the USMS Top 10, All-Americans and the All-Stars are recorded and maintained on the web in the USMS Archives. History Captain Ransom J. Arthur, a San Diego Navy doctor, had persuaded John Spannuth, President of American Swimming Coaches Association, that the event would give older swimmers (ex-competitors and beginners) a goal for keeping physically fit. In the early 1970s, Spannuth approached American swimmer June Krauser about the need for competitive swimming for adults. With Arthur and Spannuth, she founded USMS. Krauser helped organize the group and drafted its rules. She became known as the \\"Mother of Masters Swimming.\\" Krauser was an active competitor in masters swimming from the 1970s through the 2000s. Between 1972 and 2001, she set 154 national records recognized by the USMS. Spannuth said that Krauser \\"literally wrote the book when it came to competitive swimming for adults and for the Special Olympics, and did more to kick-start those two programs than anyone will ever know.\\" Masters Swimming Hall of Fame inducted Krauser.

They are hypothesized to be the descendants of the Olmec. They had a good social and commercial relationship with the later Mexica, which contributed to the economic prosperity of their culture in Chiapas. In 1494 they were invaded and defeated by the Aztecs, during the reign of Ahuizotl, and forced to pay tribute.

The Zoque were parceled out amongst the settlers, where they endured forced labor and were obliged to pay high tribute. Diseases, exploitation and the miserable conditions under which they lived contributed to a significant decrease in their numbers. The situation of the Zoque did not improve with Mexican independence, since they continued to be exploited by the mestizos and criollos. It was not until 1922, when they were assigned ejidos (common lands), that their living conditions improved somewhat.  History  = Pre-colonial period = In the pre-Hispanic period, the Zoque lived throughout Chiapas, and as far away as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and parts of the state of Tabasco. = Colonial period = In 1494, the Zoque were invaded and defeated by the Aztecs, during the reign of ƒÄhuitzotl, and forced to pay tribute.

Diseases, exploitation and the miserable conditions under which they lived contributed to a significant decrease in their numbers.  Contemporary culture  White-rimmed black pottery is characteristic of the Zoque people. The Zoque traditional dress is worn almost exclusively by women and on special occasions. Some elderly men in remote communities wear white cotton shirts. Women traditionally wear short-sleeved white blouses, with colourfully embroidered open necklines, and long poplin skirts in various colors. More recently, they wear kneelength dresses in various bright colours with white lacy trims. Until recently, it was customary for married women to undress the upper half of the body while they worked in the heat. Younger generations of women have become more timid about exposing their breasts. Their houses are mainly rectangular, with one or two rooms. Traditionally the walls were made of adobe, or mud bricks, whitewashed inside and out, and the houses had earthen floors and roofs consisting of four sloping sides of tile or thatch. More recently, they are constructed with concrete blocks, cemented floors, and corrugated iron roofs. The kitchen is usually a separate structure from the main house. As with other groups, agriculture is their prime economic activity. The crops vary according to the topography of the terrain. For the most part they raise maize, beans, chiles, and squash. Their commercial crops are coffee, cocoa, peppers, bananas, mamey, sweetsop, and guava. The soil is of poor quality, and therefore the output is low. They raise pigs and domesticated fowl in small quantities to augment their diet. The Zoque also work in the construction industry in the cities.

Life Betsey was born into slavery in Princeton, New Jersey, about the year 1798. While she was a child, her owner Robert Stockton gave her to his daughter upon her marriage to Reverend Ashbel Green, president of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). She was temporarily sent to Green's nephew, the Reverend Nathaniel Todd, but returned to Green's household in 1816. In 1817 she was admitted as a member of the First Presbyterian Church in Princeton, and formally manumitted (freed) at that time, taking the surname of Stockton. She remained as a paid domestic servant with the family, and was taught to read. She gained her education from reading in their library and home schooling by Dr. Green, and expressed a desire to go as a missionary to Africa. She also did some teaching at this time. Betsey Stockton learned of plans by Charles S. Stewart, a student at Princeton Theological Seminary and friend of the Green family, to go to Hawaii (then known as the Sandwich Islands) as a missionary. She expressed a desire to go with him and his family. Dr. Green and her Sabbath school teacher wrote letters of recommendation to the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Stockton was commissioned by the Board as a missionary, and became the first single American woman sent overseas as a missionary. Her contract with the Board and with the Stewarts said that she went \\"neither as an equal nor as a servant, but as a humble Christian friend\\" to the Stewarts, and provided that she was not to be more occupied with domestic duties than the other missionaries. The team set sail from New Haven, Connecticut on November 22, 1822 for a five-month voyage. The Stewarts and Stockton settled at LƒÅhainƒÅ on Maui. She was the teacher of the first mission school opened to the common (non-chiefly) people of Hawaii. She also trained native Hawaiian teachers, who took over from her upon her departure until the arrival of another missionary. She returned with the Stewarts to the U.S. in 1825 due to Mrs. Stewart's poor health. A version of Stockton's Hawaiian diary was published in the Christian Advocate by Dr. Green in 1824 and 1825. Stockton stayed with the Stewart household until at least 1830. She taught briefly at an infant school in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and established a school for Indians at Grape Island, Canada. After returning to Princeton in 1835, she taught in its school for people of color until her death on October 24, 1865. In 1840, she helped found Princeton's First Presbyterian Church of Color, which in 1848 was renamed the Witherspoon Street Church. She was buried in Cooperstown, New York alongside the Stewart family.

Banks against Confederate Major General Richard Taylor during Banks' operations against the Bayou Teche region in southern Louisiana. Prelude When Banks was made commander of the XIX Army Corps, Department of the Gulf, on December 16, 1862, he was ordered to coordinate an attack against the Confederate bastion of Port Hudson while General Ulysses S. Grant moved against Vicksburg. Banks made preparations for this campaign, but he knew the difficulties he would face on the march there. First, the area from New Orleans, was marshy, full of swamps, and disease would be rampant. There was also another obstacle in Bank's path ‚Äî General Richard Taylor's small Army of Western Louisiana. Banks formulated a plan that would take the XIX Corps to Alexandria, securing the Bayou Teche region that was laden with natural forage and unused supplies. He would establish supply depots along the way and then would move from Alexandria against Port Hudson. However, the quick movement he hoped for was slowed by Taylor's small army in a series of attacks, beginning with Fort Bisland, located in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana. Battle Map of Fort Bisland Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. When Banks departed New Orleans, he planned to capture Taylor's army in its entirety. On April 9, two divisions from the XIX Corps crossed Berwick Bay from Brashear City (present day Morgan City, Louisiana) to the west side at Berwick. On April 11, Banks began his advance in earnest. Taylor was well aware of Banks' advance because of successful scouting by his cavalry under Brig. Gen. Thomas Green. Green shadowed Banks' army and reported back to Taylor every detail of the maneuvers of the Union army. On April 12, Banks sent a third division, under Brig. Gen. Cuvier Grover, up the Atchafalaya River to land in the rear of Franklin, intending to intercept a Confederate retreat from Fort Bisland or turn the enemy's position. General Taylor sent some of Green's cavalry to the front to ascertain the enemy's strength and slow his advance. He also sent troops under Brig. Gen. Alfred Mouton to impede the advance of Grover's division. Late in the day, Union troops of Brig. Gen. William H. Emory's division arrived and formed a battle line outside the Fort Bisland's defenses. An artillery barrage ensued from both sides until dark when the Federal troops fell back to camp for the night. About 9:00 a.m. on April 13, Union forces again advanced on Fort Bisland. Banks had three brigades under in position south of the Bayou Teche. The brigades were deployed with Godfrey Weitzel on the left, Halbert E. Paine on the right (anchored on Bayou Teche) with Timothy Ingraham in support. Opposing the Union forces south of the Teche was the \\"Arizona Brigade\\" commanded by Brig. Gen. Henry Hopkins Sibley. North of Bayou Teche was the Union brigade of Oliver P. Gooding who faced off against Mouton's Confederate brigade. Combat did not begin until after 11:00 a.m. and continued until dusk. In addition to Confederate forces in the earthworks, the gunboat Diana, which had been captured and was now in Confederate hands, shelled the Union troops. U.S. gunboats joined the fray in late afternoon. By early evening, fire had halted. Later that night, Taylor learned that the Union division that went up the Atchafalaya and landed in his rear was now in a position to cut off a Confederate retreat. Taylor began evacuating supplies, men, and weapons, leaving a small force to slow any enemy movement. The next morning, Banks and his men found the fort abandoned. Aftermath Fort Bisland was the only fortification that could have impeded this Union offensive, and it had fallen. Banks continued his march up Bayou Teche after this initial battle onward to his ultimate objective of Alexandria, Louisiana. Taylor would slow Banks again a few days later at the Battle of Irish Bend. Opposing Forces =Union= Army of the Gulf - Major General Nathaniel P. Banks *1st Division - Brig. Gen. Christopher C.

It is the name of a townland and has been adopted as the name of an electoral ward of Belfast City council. The townland dates back to medieval times, when it was part of the territory held by the O'Neills of Clannaboy.Keith Haines, East Belfast: Paintings and Stories from Harbour to Hills, Dundurn Press Ltd., 2001, pp. 3‚Äì7 The area is centred on the Cregagh Road. The Woodstock/Cregagh Road is a continuous arterial route in the city, with the Woodstock making up the lower half of the route and the Cregagh the upper half. It runs from the Albertbridge Road, close to the Short Strand, to the A55 Outer Ring road. Woodstock Road Ravenhill Avenue with the Woodstock Road to the right and the Cregagh Road to the left The Woodstock Road forms the beginning of the continuous road that includes Cregagh and which runs from close to the River Lagan to the outskirts of Belfast. The road begins at the end of Woodstock Link, which itself starts at a junction which turns off from the Albertbridge Road facing Mountpottinger Road. The Mount, a prominent conference facility built in 1997, is located close to this junction on the Woodstock Link.The Mount Business and Conference Centre Following the junction with the Beersbridge Road the Woodstock Road is mainly lined with shops and other places of business. The area, also known as Willowfield, is also home to a number of churches, including the Church of Ireland place of worship Willowfield Parish Church,Willowfield Parish Church Saint Anthony's Roman Catholic Church.Saint Anthony's Catholic Church and the Cregagh Gospel Hall. Other amenities include a public libraryWoodstock Library and a Police Service of Northern Ireland station.Station opening hours The Willowfield area formerly lent its name to the Belfast Willowfield constituency of the old Parliament of Northern Ireland. An Ulster loyalist flute band, Crimson Star, is based in the area and their badge is shown on a mural painted on a wall on Ardenvohr Street just off the Woodstock Road.A Directory of Murals ‚Äì Album 27 During the Troubles notorious Ulster Volunteer Force hitman Robert \\"Squeak\\" Seymour ran a video shop on the Woodstock Road. It was whilst working at his shop that Seymour was shot and killed by two Provisional Irish Republican Army operatives on 15 June 1988.Cusack, Jim & McDonald, Henry (1997). UVF. Poolbeg. p.250 The Woodstock Road continues as far Ravenhill Avenue when it becomes the Cregagh Road. The Woodstock Road was formerly known as the lower Cregagh Road and in the nineteenth century it was mainly made up of farmland. Until the 1920s parts of the Cregagh Road, which is now entirely urbanised, were agricultural.Haines, East Belfast, Dundurn Press Ltd., 2001, pp. 74‚Äì75 Lower Cregagh Road At its lower stage the Cregagh Road largely continues in the same vein as the Woodstcok Road, being lined with several shops. This area also has a number of churches, the most prominent of which are Cregagh Methodist Church and Cregagh Presbyterian Church. Just off the Cregagh Road are two locally well-known sporting venues, Cregagh Cricket Club and Malone Rugby Club.Malone RFC While having separate facilities, they are situated on the same road, namely Gibson Park Avenue. Cregagh Cricket Club celebrated its centenary in 2006.Cregagh CC The cricket ground is also used by Northern Amateur Football League club Orangefield Old Boys' Association F.C. and is part of Cregagh Sports Club, effectively a merger of the cricket and association football clubs, with both sharing the same Gibson Park Avenue facilities.Orangefield OB site This alliance was concluded in the early 1980s, with the two clubs being previously unconnected. Ravenhill Stadium, the home of Ulster Rugby, lies a short distance away, about halfway between the Cregagh Road and the Ravenhill Road to the east. Cregagh Estate Mural commemorating the 36th (Ulster) Division, Cregagh Estate The Cregagh Estate is located off the Cregagh Road, starting after the roundabout junction with Ladas Drive and Mount Merrion Avenue. The junction is immediately after Bell's Bridge which crosses the Loop River, one of Belfast's myriad minor rivers.Bell's Bridge, Cregagh The estate was built as a public housing project in 1946‚Äì1947 and was designed by government architect T. F. O. Rippingham. Tenants have subsequently been offered the opportunity to purchase their homes. The estate is characterised by its uncommon flat roofs and staggered house fronts. The streets in the Cregagh Estate are named after the rivers and streams of the island of Ireland (e.g. Callan Way, Kilbroney Bend). Although predominantly Protestant from its inception, Cregagh had a significant Catholic minority for a number of years and at the start of the Troubles, Catholics even joined in local vigilante patrols under the auspices of the Cregagh Tenants Association. This co-operation ended in 1972 with the arrival of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and before long most of the Catholic residents had left the area for west Belfast.Community Case Studies Around this time housing allocation in the area came under UDA control and the local \\"Tartan gangs\\" were taken over as the junior UDA. Subsequently, however the UDA declined in the area, and east Belfast in general, and the Ulster Volunteer Force became more important, with UVF murals being painted on Cregagh's walls.Michael E. Geisler, National symbols, fractured identities: contesting the national narrative, UPNE, 2005, pp. 188‚Äì189 By 2018 however the only murals on Cregagh estate are one commemorating Victoria Cross winners Eric Norman Frankland Bell, Geoffrey Cather, William McFadzean and Robert Quigg and another showing local boy George Best. Upper Cregagh Road Beyond the Cregagh estate the road is made up of mainly private housing and continues as far as Upper Knockbreda Road. Cregagh LibraryCregagh Library and the former home of Castlereagh Borough Council are found on this part of the road. The latter building has been extensively refurbished and is now the Museum Of Orange Heritage. The neighbouring Montgomery Road is the location for the former Robinson Centre leisure facilityRobinson Centre and the Castlereagh campus of Belfast Metropolitan College. The area was sometimes nicknamed the \\"Bible belt\\".Some Things About Belfast Immediately beyond the end of the Cregagh Road, on the opposite side of the Upper Knockbreda Road, is a forested area known as Cregagh Glen. The Upper Knockbreda Road, otherwise known as the A55 Outer Ring, was completed in 1967 to link Cregagh with the Knock area on the outskirts of east Belfast.Completed New Road Schemes Some of the streets in Cregagh are named after Second World War generals (e.g. Montgomery, Alanbrooke) while a significant number are named after First World War battlefields (e.g. Picardy, Hamel). This connection with the wars reflects the numbers of people from the area who died in those wars. This was also a reason why the location was chosen for a large number of ex-servicemen's homes, with 150 of the so-called \\"homes fit for heroes\\" promised by David Lloyd George built around this area in the late 1920s.Haines, East Belfast, p. 52 However this area, which was known locally as \\"the Colony\\", remained the only significant public housing scheme for ex-soldiers to be undertaken in Belfast in the aftermath of the First World War.Richard S. Grayson, Belfast Boys: How Unionists and Nationalists Fought and Died Together in the First World War, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2009, p. 151 A memorial to the dead of the First World War, consisting of a Celtic Cross, was unveiled in 1929 before being rededicated in 1932 by Edward, Prince of Wales. Castlereagh council expanded the memorial a number of times during the 1990s, adding a stone for the Ulster Special Constabulary, another stone for the Ulster Defence Regiment and a back plaque commemorating members of both of these groups and the Royal Ulster Constabulary as well as civilians killed during the Troubles and local residents who died during the Second World War.Gregory John Ashworth, Brian J. Graham, Senses of place: senses of time, Ashgate Publishing, 2005, p. 126 Notable people The late footballer George Best grew up in the Cregagh Estate, and as a boy played football on the open playing fields at the centre of the estate.

Porter, T.V. Jones, & M.H. Beer (Eds.), Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy (18th ed., ch. 212). New York: Wiley, John & Sons Although described over 100 years ago and not uncommon in practice, the nature of this phenomenon is still uncertain. The very term \\"acrocyanosis\\" is often applied inappropriately in cases when blue discoloration of the hands, feet, or parts of the face is noted. The principal (primary) form of acrocyanosis is that of a benign cosmetic condition, sometimes caused by a relatively benign neurohormonal disorder. Regardless of its cause, the benign form typically does not require medical treatment. A medical emergency would ensue if the extremities experience prolonged periods of exposure to the cold, particularly in children and patients with poor general health. However, frostbite differs from acrocyanosis because pain (via thermal nociceptors) often accompanies the former condition, while the latter is very rarely associated with pain. There are also a number of other conditions that affect hands, feet, and parts of the face with associated skin color changes that need to be differentiated from acrocyanosis: Raynaud‚Äôs phenomenon, pernio, acrorygosis, erythromelalgia, blue finger syndrome. The diagnosis may be challenging in some cases, especially when these syndromes co-exist. Acrocyanosis may be a sign of a more serious medical problem, such as connective tissue diseases and diseases associated with central cyanosis. Other causative conditions include infections, toxicities, antiphospholipid syndrome, cryoglobulinemia, neoplasms. In these cases, the observed cutaneous changes are known as \\"secondary acrocyanosis\\". They may have a less symmetric distribution and may be associated with pain and tissue loss. Signs and symptoms Acrocyanosis is characterized by peripheral cyanosis: persistent cyanosis of the hands, feet, or face. The extremities often are cold and clammy and may exhibit some swelling (especially in the warmer weather). The palms and soles exhibit a wide range of sweating from moderately moist to profuse, but all peripheral pulses should have normal rate, rhythm, and quality. Exposure to cold temperatures worsens the cyanosis, while it often improves on warming. Aside from the color changes, patients normally are asymptomatic and therefore there is usually no associated pain. The most common sign, discoloration, usually is what prompts patients to seek medical care. Pathophysiology The precise mechanism of acrocyanosis is not known. The current line of thinking goes that vasospasms in the cutaneous arteries and arterioles produce cyanotic discoloration, while compensatory dilatation in the postcapillary venules causes sweating. Arteriovenous subpapillary plexus shunting also occurs. Persistent vasoconstriction at the precapillary sphincter creates a local hypoxic environment, thus releasing adenosine into the capillary bed.Guyton, A.C. & Hall, J.E. (2006) Textbook of Medical Physiology (11th ed.) Philadelphia: Elsevier Saunder Vasospasms force adenosine to enter the capillary bed, where it vasodilates the postcapillary venules. Such differences in vessel tone create a countercurrent exchange system that attempts to retain heat. Profuse sweating would then be caused by an overwhelmed countercurrent exchange system. In addition to adenosine, other hormones may contribute to acrocyanosis such as increase blood levels of serotonin. This would seem to support case studies reporting acrocyanosis as an unusual side effect for pediatric patients taking tricyclic antidepressants, as these medications can inhibit the reuptake of serotonin and thus increase their blood concentrations. Acrocyanosis has been reported in association with many other medications and substances. Diagnosis Acrocyanosis is diagnosed clinically, based on a medical history and physical examination; laboratory studies or imaging studies are not necessary. The normal peripheral pulses rule out peripheral arterial occlusive disease, where arterial narrowing limits blood flow to the extremities. Pulse oximetry will show a normal oxygen saturation. Unlike the closely related Raynaud's phenomenon, cyanosis is continually persistent. In addition, there is usually no associated trophic skin changes, localized pain, or ulcerations. Capillaroscopy and other laboratory methods may be helpful but only complement clinical diagnosis in unclear cases, especially when connective tissue disorders may be present. Treatment There is no standard medical or surgical treatment for acrocyanosis, and treatment, other than reassurance and avoidance of cold, is usually unnecessary. The patient is reassured that no serious illness is present. A sympathectomy would alleviate the cyanosis by disrupting the fibers of the sympathetic nervous system to the area. However, such an extreme procedure would rarely be appropriate. Treatment with vasoactive drugs is not recommended but traditionally is mentioned as optional. However, there is little, if any, empirical evidence that vasoactive drugs (Œ±-adrenergic blocking agents or calcium channel blockers) are effective. Prognosis While there is no cure for acrocyanosis, patients otherwise have excellent prognosis. Unless acrocyanosis results from another condition (e.g. malignancy, antiphospholipid syndrome, atherosclerosis, acute ischemic limb, bacterial endocarditis), there is no associated increased risk of disease or death, and there are no known complications. Aside from the discoloration, there are no other symptoms: no pain, and no loss of function. Patients can expect to lead normal lives. In secondary acrocyanosis treatment of the primary condition defines outcomes. Epidemiology Although there is no definitive reporting on its incidence, acrocyanosis shows prevalence in children and young adults than in patients thirty years of age or older. Epidemiological data suggests that cold climate, outdoor occupation, and low body mass index are significant risk factors for developing acrocyanosis. As expected, acrocyanosis would be more prevalent in women than in men due to differences in BMI. However, the incidence rate of acrocyanosis often decreases with increasing age, regardless of regional climate. It completely resolves in many women after menopause implying significant hormonal influences. In the newborn Acrocyanosis is common initially after delivery in the preterm and full term newborn.Engle, W.A. & Boyle, D.W. (2005). Delivery room management and transitional care. In L.M. Osborn, T.G. DeWitt, L.R. First, & J.A. Zenel (Eds.), Pediatrics (pp. 1250-61). Philadelphia: Elsevier Mosby Intervention is typically not required as it is seen as a normal finding. Acrocyanosis can also return in a newborn if a baby is cold, such as after a bath, and is considered normal as well.

In 2013, the Queensland Government approached the Venice-Simplon Orient Express for permission to operate the remaining carriages on tours in Queensland. In February 2016 the carriages were moved from the Workshops Rail Museum at Ipswich to the Port of Brisbane for shipment to Peru where they will be used by the Orient Express Hotels' successor Belmond and its partly-owned railroad company PeruRail. The train entered service in May 2017 as Belmond Andean Explorer, carrying passengers from Cusco to Puno (at the Lake Titicaca) and to Arequipa. Rolling stock The 21 carriages were built at the Queensland Rail workshops in Townsville for $35 million. They were built to operate on both the narrow gauge in Queensland and in New South Wales with the train undergoing a bogie exchange en route at Acacia Ridge. The train consisted of sleeping cars in three different comfort levels (Pullman, State and Commissioner Suites), two dining cars, two bar cars (one of them with an open- air observation deck), a power car and staff sleepers. The entire train layout was designed similar to the Eastern and Oriental Express, but with a different interior style.

It is native to forests and woodlands of the Afrotropics. Though it is the most widespread and catholic in habitat choice of the three Apaloderma species, their numbers are locally depleted due to deforestation. Some populations are sedentary while others undertake regular movements. The species name commemorates Narina, mistress of French ornithologist Fran√ßois Levaillant, whose name he derived from a Khoikhoi word for \\"flower\\", as her given name was difficult to pronounce. Description Female in South Africa It is sexually dimorphic, with males more brightly coloured. Both sexes have vivid, gingery green upperpart plumage. The tail feathers have a metallic blue-green gloss. The outer three rectices on each side are tipped and fringed white, giving the undertail of perched birds a characteristic white appearance (compare bar- tailed trogon). The wing coverts are a grizzled grey, and remiges mostly colourless grey. The male especially, has bright amaranth red underside plumage and bare, green gape and eye flanges. The female has brown face and chest plumage, blue skin orbiting the eyes and duller red plumage below. Immature birds resemble females, but have distinct white tips to the tertials (inner wing), and less distinct gape and eye flanges. Range and habitat The species has a large range in Africa, inhabiting lowland to highland, valley and riparian forests, from tropical to temperate regions, those occurring in highlands dispersing seasonally to lower levels. It is found from Sierra Leone to Ethiopia, and east Africa to eastern and southern South Africa. Due to its wide range and varied habitat choice, the Narina trogon is considered to be a species of least conservation concern. Habits and nesting The diet consists mainly of insects and small invertebrates as well as rodents and small reptiles. The call is a grating, low repeated hoot, given by males only, in defending territory or attracting mates. The male's bare, blue-green throat patch is expanded when calling and both sexes may fluff out the breast feathers in display. They nest in a tree hollow in which both sexes incubate or brood.

Originally constructed in 1925 and opened as the Myles Standish Hotel, it was deemed to be one of the finest hotels in the world. In 1949 BU acquired the building and converted it into a dormitory. In 2018, BU completed a comprehensive two-year renovation, completely rebuilding the interior of the building.  As a hotel  When the doors to the hotel opened in 1928, it offered many amenities and was situated in a prime location in the developing Back Bay neighborhood in Boston next to the Kenmore Square trolley station. It was one of many such hotels, including the Sheraton located just down the street at 91 Bay State Road, which would itself be later purchased by BU and converted into a dormitory. Due to its proximity to Fenway Park the hotel was often patronized by visiting baseball clubs. Babe Ruth himself stayed there often, and liked suite 818 so much that he made it a habit to request it specifically. In 1933 Charles Newton took over as manager and rescued it from the Great Depression, turning it into a fashionable apartment hotel. He left in 1943 when the hotel was sold to the Sheraton Corporation and in 1949 the building was sold to Boston University.  Becoming a dormitory  The University, experiencing heavy growth due to returning World War II troops making use of their G.I. Bill entitlements, was in desperate need of housing for students, and quickly converted the facility to dormitory use for its male students. In 1970 Myles made BU history by becoming the first dorm to permit guests of any gender 24 hours a day. In the summer of 1973, Myles was \\"condemned\\" due to structural problems. BU obtained alternate dormitory space that year at Fensgate Hall down Beacon St., with dining across the street at Charlesgate Hall. Myles reopened for the 1974‚Äì75 academic year. In 1979, with the bankruptcy of Graham Junior College, the University purchased the school's administration building adjacent to Myles. This building had several uses before being permanently converted into dormitory space and annexed to Myles, giving birth to what is now known as Myles Annex. With the renovation of Myles completed in 2018, the Annex is fully integrated into Myles Standish Hall.  Layout  Myles is a nine-story building. The first floor houses the building's mailroom, multiple group study rooms, games room, laundry room and a community kitchen. The dining hall was closed beginning in Fall 2012 with the main dining room being converted into a multipurpose room. The remaining eight floors are residential. The shape of the building is somewhat unusual. Due to the irregular proportions of the plot of land on which it was built at the intersection of Bay State Road and Beacon Street, the building is known for its sharp point resembling the prow of a ship. This makes for unusual floor plans. The eight residential levels accommodate 730 residents in a coeducational setting with rooms arrayed in a semi-suite-style setting. There are a variety of suite configurations ranging from 2 single bedroom suites to suites with 8 single bedrooms. The predominant unit has 2 single bedrooms and 1 double occupancy bedroom sharing a bathroom. Myles' fourth floor is designated as the Global House living/learning community.  Security  As with all large residence halls at BU, access is by presenting student identification. Non-residents must be signed in and are restricted in the duration of their stay and the times at which they are permitted to enter and leave. Due to the relatively large size of each individual floor, two resident assistants staff each floor.

A traveler in the American Southwest, he settled in Los Angeles, California, where he also became known as an historian, photographer, ethnographer, archaeologist, poet, and librarian. Early life and career Charles Fletcher Lummis was born in 1859, in Lynn, Massachusetts. He lost his mother at age 2 and was homeschooled by his father, who was a schoolmaster. Lummis enrolled in Harvard for college and was a classmate of Theodore Roosevelt's, but dropped out during his senior year. While at Harvard he worked during the summer as a printer and published his first work, Birch Bark Poems. This small volume was printed on paper-thin sheets of birch bark; he won acclaim from Life magazine and recognition from some of the day's leading poets. He sold the books by subscription and used the money to pay for college. A poem from this work, \\"My Cigarette\\", highlighted tobacco as one of his life's obsessions. In 1880, at the age of 21, Lummis married Dorothea Rhodes of Cincinnati, Ohio. =Transcontinental walk= In 1884, Lummis was working for a newspaper in Cincinnati and was offered a job with the Los Angeles Times. At that time, Los Angeles had a population of only 12,000. Lummis decided to make the 3,507-mile journey from Cincinnati to Los Angeles on foot, taking 143 days, all the while sending weekly dispatches to the paper chronicling his trip.Lummis, Charles F., A Tramp Across the Continent. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons (1920), p.2 One of his dispatches chronicled his meeting and interview with famed outlaw Frank James. The trip began in September and lasted through the winter. Lummis suffered a broken arm and struggled in the heavy winter snows of New Mexico. He became enamored with the American Southwest, and its Spanish and Native American inhabitants. Several years later, he published his account of this journey in A Tramp Across the Continent (1892). =Editor at the Los Angeles Times= Upon his arrival, Lummis was offered the job of the first City Editor of the Los Angeles Times. He covered a multitude of interesting stories from the new and growing community. Work was hard and demanding under the pace set by publisher Harrison Gray Otis. Lummis was happy until he suffered from a mild stroke that left his left side paralyzed. =New Mexico= In 1888, Lummis moved to San Mateo, New Mexico to recuperate from his paralysis. He rode on the Plains while holding a rifle in one good hand and shooting jack rabbits. Here, he began a new career as a prolific freelance writer, writing on everything that was particularly special about the Southwest and Indian cultures. His articles about corrupt bosses committing murders in San Mateo drew threats on his life, so he moved to a new location in the Pueblo Indian village of Isleta, New Mexico, on the Rio Grande. =Indians of Isleta= Somewhat recovered from his paralysis, Lummis was able to win over the confidence of the Pueblo Indians, a Tiwa people, by his outgoing and generous nature. But a hit man from San Mateo was sent up to Isleta, where he shot Lummis but failed to kill him. In Isleta, Lummis divorced his first wife and married Eva Douglas, who lived in the village and was the sister-in-law of an English trader. Somehow he convinced Eva to stay with Dorothea in Los Angeles until the divorce went through. In the meantime, Lummis became entangled in fights with the U.S. government agents over Indian education. In this period, the government was pushing assimilation and had established Indian boarding schools. It charged its agents with recruiting Native American children for the schools, where they were usually forced to give up traditional clothing and hair styles, and prevented from speaking their own languages or using their own customs. They were often prohibited from returning home during holidays or vacation periods, or their families were too poor to afford such travel. Lummis persuaded the government to allow 36 children from the Albuquerque Indian School to return to their homes. While in Isleta, he made friends with Father Anton Docher from France; he was the missionary Padre of Isleta. They both also befriended Adolph Bandelier. While living in Isleta, Lummis boarded in the home of Juan Rey Abeita. In 1890, he traveled with Bandelier to study the indigenous people of the area. =Preservationist= As president of the Landmarks Club of Southern California (an all-volunteer, privately funded group dedicated to the preservation of California's Spanish missions), Lummis noted that the historic structures \\"...were falling to ruin with frightful rapidity, their roofs being breached or gone, the adobe walls melting under the winter rains.\\" Thompson, pp. 185‚Äì186 Lummis wrote in 1895, \\"In ten years from now‚Äîunless our intelligence shall awaken at once‚Äî\\"there will remain of these noble piles nothing but a few indeterminable heaps of adobe. We shall deserve and shall have the contempt of all thoughtful people if we suffer our noble missions to fall.\\" =Magazine editor= Charles Fletcher Lummis, 1897 In 1892, Lummis published Some Strange Corners of Our Country, recounting some of the areas and sights he had discovered. Between 1893 and 1894, he spent 10 months traveling in Peru with Bandelier. After the men's return, Lummis and Eva returned to Los Angeles with their year-old daughter, Turbese. Unemployed, Lummis landed the position of editor of a regional magazine, Land of Sunshine. The magazine was renamed Out West and in 1901. He published works by famous authors such as Jack London and John Muir. Over his 11 years as editor, Lummis also wrote more than 500 pieces for the magazine, as well as a popular monthly commentary called \\"In the Lion's Den\\". =Indian rights activist= Lummis also established a new Indian rights group called the \\" Sequoya League\\", after the noted early 19th-century Cherokee leader Sequoyah who developed a written alphabet for the language. Lummis fought against the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs and called on his classmate President Teddy Roosevelt to help change their manner of operating. He found a home for a small group of Indians who had been evicted from their property in the Palm Springs, California area. The Sequoya League began a battle against Indian Agent Charles Burton, accusing him of imposing a \\"reign of terror\\" on the Hopi pueblo in Oraibi by requiring Hopi men to cut their long hair. It was their custom to wear it long, a practice with spiritual meaning. Lummis was accused of overstating the case against Burton and lost his welcome at the White House. (However, subsequent social pressure on Burton led him to reverse the haircutting policy.) Later life In 1905, Lummis took the position as City Librarian of the Los Angeles Public Library. Lummis replaced Mary Jones as City Librarian even though he had no prior library training. He was criticized for the way he ran the library and insisted on doing most of the work at home. He resigned from that sole source of income in 1911, while he worked to start up the Southwest Museum while engaged in a bitter and public divorce with his wife Eva. In that year Lummis went blind, which he attributed to a \\"jungle fever\\" contracted while in Guatemala exploring the Mayan ruins of Quirigu√°. After more than a year of blindness, during which he might appear in public with his eyes covered by a bandanna or wearing dark amber glasses, he regained his sight. Some privately doubted Lummis actually went blind; among them was John Muir, who said so in a letter to him and encouraged him to get more rest. In 1915, Lummis married his third wife, Gertrude, at El Alisal. By 1918, he was destitute. In 1923, the Southwest Museum Board named him founder emeritus and gave him a small stipend. In 1925, Lummis also decided to enlarge, revise, and republish Some Strange Corners of Our Country as Mesa, Canyon and Pueblo. He also engaged in a renewed civil rights crusade on behalf of the Pueblo Indians. Death Lummis died November 25, 1928. He was cremated, and his ashes were placed in a vault in a wall at El Alisal. Supporters bought his home El Alisal, which was until 2015 used as the headquarters of the Historical Society of Southern California. Legacy and honors Lummis' cultural influence remains today, including a lasting imprint on the Mount Washington neighborhood of Los Angeles. The home he built, The Lummis House, and the museum he founded, The Southwest Museum, are located within 0.7 miles of each other and remain open to the public for limited hours on weekends. =El Alisal (Lummis House) = El Alisal in 2007 Lummis purchased a 3-acre plot around 1895 and spent 13 years building what would become a 4,000-square- foot stone home with an exhibition hall, calling it El Alisal. He frequently entertained, with parties he called \\"noises\\" for various writers, artists, and other prominent figures. The parties usually included a lavish Spanish dinner with dancing and music performed by his own private troubadour. The extravaganzas wore out a number of female assistants or \\"secretaries\\" conscripted into working on them. The Lummis House was donated to the Southwest Museum in 1910 and then sold in 1943 to the state of California, which transferred it to the city in 1971. The Historical Society of Southern California took occupancy in 1965, using it as headquarters and helping manage the property, eventually leaving in 2014. Open to the public as a museum and park on Saturdays and Sundays, the site also serves as a focus for Lummis Day activities (see below). =Southwest Museum= By 1907, Lummis had founded the Southwest Museum of Los Angeles, California. He had led the fundraising campaign to build a new structure for it and saw the building open in August 1914. The Southwest Museum operated independently until 2003, when it was merged into the Autry Museum of the American West. The Autry launched a multi- year conservation project to preserve the enormous collection amassed by Lummis and his successors. Much of the material was moved off-site, but The Southwest Museum has maintained an ongoing public exhibit on Pueblo pottery that is free of charge and open on Saturdays only. =Lummis Day Festival= Beginning in 2006, the annual Lummis Day Festival was established by the Lummis Day Community Foundation. It holds the festival in Lummis' honor on the first Sunday in June, drawing people to El Alisal and Heritage Square Museum for poetry readings, art exhibits, music, dance performances, and family activities. The foundation is a non-profit organization of community activists and arts organization leaders. Publications The Spanish Pioneers And The California Missions.

The title is derived from \\"Olly olly oxen free\\" a phrase used in children's games to indicate that those in hiding came out into the open safely and freely.Edwards 1985, pp. 392‚Äì393. Plot Eccentric Miss Pudd (Katharine Hepburn) is the owner of what she considers an antiques store but most would call a junkyard. She frequently refuses to part with her merchandise because of its sentimental or historical value. However, she does agree to lend some items to two boys, Alby (Kevin McKenzie) and Chris (Dennis Dimster), who befriend her. The boys explain that they are repairing an antique hot air balloon that belonged to Alby's grandfather, an adventurous stunt man named The Great Sandusky. In honor and memory of Alby's grandfather, who died one year earlier and is sorely missed by Alby, they plan to take the balloon aloft to celebrate the grandfather's birthday. The balloon is accidentally inflated and launched, with the two boys and their English sheepdog in the basket. Miss Pudd chases after them in her antique car and ends up riding the anchor dangling from the bottom of the basket. After she is pulled up, the balloon continues to drift and gets lost in a fog. That night, they drift finally to Los Angeles, where a police helicopter demands that they land. The balloon lands on the stage of the Hollywood Bowl, at an outdoor concert where the orchestra is playing Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. Amidst fireworks, the audience thinks the balloon landing is part of the show and is enthralled as the ragamuffin crew disembarks and is sent home.

It was originally published online before being serialised in 2002, in the British anthology Judge Dredd Megazine. A sequel, Scarlet Traces: The Great Game, followed in 2006. Edginton and D'Israeli's 2006 adaptation of H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds is effectively a prequel to Scarlet Traces, as key characters of Scarlet Traces can be glimpsed therein and the same designs for the Martians and their technology are used. A fourth series, Scarlet Traces: Cold War, appeared in 2000 AD in 2016 and 2017. Setting Scarlet Traces is based on the premise that Britain was able to reverse engineer alien technology, abandoned after the abortive Martian invasion of The War of the Worlds, to establish economic and political dominance over the remainder of the world. The artwork shows an imposition of futuristic devices on early 20th century society. In the first series, set in 1908, London cabbies and the Household Cavalry have swapped their horses for mechanical devices with spiderlike legs; homes are heated and lit by modified versions of the Martian heat ray; the pigeons of Trafalgar Square are thinned out by miniature Martian war machines. In the sequel, Britain of the late 1930s is recreated along fairly recognisable lines but with an additional layer of alien derived technology. Plot =Scarlet Traces= The story begins ten years after the abortive Martian invasion of Earth, with bodies being washed up on the banks of the river Thames. The bodies are all female and drained of blood, prompting a local drunk, whose dog discovers them, to think that a vampire is on the loose. Emerging from comfortable retirement in fashionable Bedford Square, Major Robert Autumn DSO and his trusty manservant Colour Sergeant Arthur Currie search for the culprits after being informed that Currie's niece is most likely one of the missing girls. Autumn is represented as a classic Victorian hero: honourable, perceptive and brave but out of his depth in a new age of ruthless exploitation personified by the bullish, cynical government official Dr Davenport Spry. After following the investigation across England and Scotland the pair, now accompanied by the drunk from London, discover that a single Martian has survived the bacteria by turning its own war machine into a hermetic chamber. In return for its life - and human blood to sustain it, the alien dubbed \\"Humpty\\", has been assisting British scientists in mastering advanced Martian technical skills. In the finale Spry reveals that Britain, having come to dominate Earth using its newly acquired technology, now intends to invade Mars. In an ensuing fight Currie is killed, and Autumn loses an arm. Spry kills the captive Martian which has now served its purpose, and contemptuously dismisses Autumn as a \\"dusty relic\\". Later, a crippled and alcoholic Autumn witnesses the departure of Britain's Stella Expeditionary Force to Mars, amid general scenes of patriotic fervor. =Scarlet Traces: The Great Game= Thirty years after the events of Scarlet Traces, the counter-invasion of Mars is going badly, with the Martians successfully defending themselves using heat ray weapons against the invaders. Charlotte Hemming, an aristocratic young photojournalist, is saved by Robert Autumn from the thuggish agents of an increasingly repressive British Government - led by Spry, now Prime Minister. Autumn asks her to travel to Mars and investigate why out of the thousands of soldiers sent, only three hundred and seventy two have returned from the war. At the same time, the government is shown to be under pressure from a Nationalistic Scottish breakaway faction; plus Canada, Australia and New Zealand who wish to remove their troops from the space combat. Hemming's spaceship is shot down as it enters Mars' atmosphere. She survives, but her cover is blown. She discovers that the Martians are not in fact native to Mars, but seem to have originated from a now-destroyed planet that became the asteroid belt. She theorises that a previous civilisation existed on Mars and was itself plunged into warfare by the arrival of the Asteroid \\"Martians\\", resulting in their extinction. Hemming also discovers that the Martians have been using genetic techniques to mimic humanity to an indistinguishable degree - but the government is already aware of this, and has been preventing any substantial return of veterans to Earth, in case they are in fact disguised Martians. Spry's government is about to deliver a coup de grace in some unknown form, and destroy all the remaining Martians - as well as an expendable rearguard left behind when the main body of the expeditionary force is secretly evacuated. The expected doomsday weapon is delivered, and turns out to be modified Cavorite in capsule form, which sticks to anything it touches, and lifts it off the planet into the vacuum of space. Hemming is amongst those who survive, but they discover that humanoid Martians have taken control of the Lunar colony, and turned its mass driver into a weapon targeted on Earth. The bulk of the returning expeditionary force has been ambushed and destroyed. Ultimately the Martians are defeated when a Commonwealth space fleet, originally intended to evacuate their own troops, arrives and with the surviving British ships engage the Martians in a crossfire. Earth is saved, and the British government falls, with Spry being amongst those killed in the mass driver attacks which have devastated London and much of southern England. Some years later, a retired Hemming is approached by officials of the new government who are worried she will expose the truth, which has been repressed. She assures them that she has no intention of upsetting the status quo, and returns to her garden - which contains several Triffids.

The fictional Hobbs End underground station is a reference to Quatermass and the Pit. Captain Haddock, Tintin and. Snowy (from The Adventures of Tintin) can be spotted on page 42. There is a cameo by Dan Dare and Digby. =References in other works by Edginton and D'Israeli= The War of the Worlds adaptation by Dark Horse Comics contains several references to Scarlet Traces. Autumn and Currie can be seen in a newspaper as having saved Emperor Menelik of Abyssinia from an assassin. Ned Penny can be seen on the Thunder Child. An Archie the dog look- alike appears in the ruins of London. An official figure supervising the removal of Martian tripods after the end of the war resembles a young Dr. Spry, while the two army sergeants awaiting his orders reappear as Coughly and Dravott in Scarlet Traces. The adaptation ends with the narrator reflecting that it may be possible for humans to spread throughout the solar system also. In Kingdom of the Wicked, also by Edginton and D'Israeli, the main character's wife is seen reading Scarlet Traces. Publication history The original Scarlet Traces was conceived as a partially animated serial, intended for the now-defunct website Cool Beans World. In an interview for 2000AD Review, Edginton said \\"The Cool Beans version was to have been like a little movie in many ways. It had music, sound effects, zooms, pans and dissolves. There was even going to be some limited animation of the War Machines. A lot of the work was done and in the can when Cool Beans shut down production...\\" The website ceased operation after only a fraction of the serial had been published. \\"...when Cool Beans folded, we had a comic which was only 75% complete and which was still owned by the defunct publisher... Having retrieved the property, Ian (Edginton) then managed to license our previously-unpublished comic to Rebellion's Judge Dredd Megazine as a reprint ‚Äî thus giving us the funds to complete the story while retaining ownership.\\" (D'Israeli, from his blog). D'Israeli reworked Scarlet Traces as a traditional comic book story. This version was serialised in 2002 in the British anthology Judge Dredd Megazine (vol 4) issues 16 to 18. In 2003 it was collected in its own 4-issue limited series (with minor revisions) by US publisher Dark Horse Comics, and subsequently collected into one hardcover volume by Dark Horse Comics in August 2003 (). The Great Game was first published in a four-issue mini-series by Dark Horse Comics in 2006. The War of the Worlds was published in the same year.

Argentina has become famous for its rich European flavor. Tourist attractions The most popular tourist sites are found in the historic core of the city, in the Montserrat and San Telmo neighborhoods. Buenos Aires was conceived around the Plaza de Mayo, the colony's administrative center. To the east of the square is the Casa Rosada, the official seat of the executive branch of the government of Argentina. To the north, the Catedral Metropolitana which has stood in the same location since colonial times, and the Banco de la Naci√≥n Argentina building, a parcel of land originally owned by Juan de Garay. Other important colonial institutions were Cabildo, to the west, which was renovated during the construction of Avenida de Mayo and Julio A. Roca. To the south is the Congreso de la Naci√≥n (National Congress), which currently houses the Academia Nacional de la Historia (National Academy of History). Lastly, to the northwest, is City Hall. Avenida de Mayo links the Casa Rosada with the Argentine National Congress. On this avenue there are several buildings of cultural, architectural, and historical importance, such as Casa de la Cultura, the Palacio Barolo and Caf√© Tortoni. Underneath the avenue, the first subte (metro) line Line A in South America, opened in 1913. The avenue ends at Plaza del Congreso, which features a number of monuments and sculptures, including one of Auguste Rodin's few surviving original casts of \\"The Thinker\\". 2007 list of the World's Best Cities, by Travel + Leisure Magazine. Today it still ranks in top 10. The Buenos Aires Japanese Gardens, the World's largest outside Japan The Manzana de las Luces (\\"Illuminated Block\\") area features the San Ignacio church, the Colegio Nacional Buenos Aires, and the old city council building (1894 to 1931). This area features tunnels and catacombs, which crossed underneath the Plaza de Mayo during colonial times. In the San Telmo neighborhood of, Plaza Dorrego hosts an antiques fair on Sundays, complete with tango shows. They also have tango shows daily at the famous plaza. On weekends they involve many tourists to learn how to dance. Frequent tours and activities are also available at the Church of Nuestra Se√±ora de Bethlehem, the San Pedro Telmo Parish and the Antonio Ballv√© Penintetiary Museum. The National Historical Museum in Parque Lezama is a few blocks south. The Ayres Porte√±os Hostel is a very famous hostel as it is also a tourist attraction, it is decorated and painted by artists from La Boca and possesses a unique collection of local paintings among its walls. The borough of Recoleta is home to a number of places of interest, including the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, the Biblioteca Nacional, the Centro Cultural Recoleta, the Faculty of Law of the Universidad de Buenos Aires, the Bas√≠lica Nuestra Se√±ora de Pilar, the Palais de Glace, the Caf√© La Biela and the Cementerio de la Recoleta, where Eva Per√≥n's crypt can be visited, among those of many other Argentine historical and cultural figures. El Ateneo Grand Splendid is one of the city's most well-known bookshops and, having moved from its original downtown location, today operates on Santa F√© Avenue, where \\"Barrio Norte\\" meets the borough of Palermo. Once a theatre and later a cinema, the building still retains the feeling of the grand theatre it once was, despite its recent renovation. Plaza Italia, site of a monument to Giuseppe Garibaldi, the Buenos Aires Zoo, the botanical gardens, and the Palermo woods (famous for its paddleboat lake, rose garden, and planetarium) are all a short walk to the east of it. View of the Puerto Madero district The borough of Retiro features the Retiro Railway Terminal and several other notable landmarks, including the Plaza San Mart√≠n square, its monument to the Falklands War Fallen, an equestrian statue of General San Mart√≠n and, nearby, the Anglo-Argentine community's present to Argentina the Torre Monumental (formerly Torre de los Ingleses), the ornate Basilica Sant√≠simo Sacramento and the Art Deco Kavanagh Building, still one of the tallest in the city. The Museo de Arte Latinoamericano de Buenos Aires is located in the barrio of Palermo, and is one of the most important in the country. In this neighbourhood can also be found the Bosques de Palermo, the Planetary and Buenos Aires Zoo. The southern area of the city, (including barrios such as Barracas and Parque Patricios) while traditionally not a top tourist destination, is historically the source for much of the city's early tango culture. It is now home to a burgeoning arts scene. Another important tourist site is Avenida Corrientes; among dozens of cinemas, theatres, booksellers and music shops, this avenue is home to the San Mart√≠n Cultural Center, Paseo La Plaza and the Luna Park coliseum. At the intersection of this avenue with Avenida 9 de julio, the Obelisco, the emblem of the City of Buenos Aires, is located. The Art Deco Mercado de Abasto, which is currently a shopping mall, is also on this avenue. At the southwest end of the city, the Buenos Aires circuit and the Parque de la ciudad are located. One of the biggest thematic parks in Latin America, the amusement park centers around its 200 metre-high Torre Espacial tower. Buenos Aires has been attracting a homosexual community in Latin America. Since 2006, the city has seen unprecedented numbers of gay- oriented cruise ship arrivals, an increase in the number of gay-owned businesses, and the construction of a five-star gay-oriented hotel; despite its relatively unfavorable location, the Axel Hotel Buenos Aires has remained popular since opening in October 2007.

In all, nearly 27,000 rooms were available for tourism in Buenos Aires, of which about 12,000 belonged to four-star, five-star, or boutique hotels. Establishments of a higher category typically enjoy the city's highest occupation rates. The majority of the hotels are located in the central part of the city, in close proximity to most main tourist attractions. For the traveler desiring more independence and privacy, there is an abundance of furnished apartments for rent. These range from small, low-cost studios to expensive, luxurious apartments.

It was uncovered during an archaeological excavation at Bamburgh Castle in 1960 by Brian Hope-Taylor. The sword was missing until his death in 2001, when it was found in a suitcase in his garage. It is unique amongst swords of its period, having been formed by six strands of iron pattern welded into a blade, resulting in speculation that it may have been the sword of a king. Description The Bamburgh Sword is similar in size to a Roman spatha, and would have originally measured about in length. It is an Anglo-Saxon weapon which has been dated to the seventh century, and was likely to have been buried in either the tenth or eleventh centuries. It has a pattern welded blade which historians have identified by x-rays as being unique to the time period in that it uses six strands of iron to form the sword, when no other blades of that era were made of more than four strands. It would have taken a blacksmith around two months to create the blade; archaeologist Paul Gething said that to \\"produce a weapon of this calibre required state-of-the-art technology of the time, those who witnessed the creation of this weapon would have thought it the equivalent of magic.\\" The relative cost of the Bamburgh Sword during the era of its creation has led archaeologists to speculate that the original owner would have been either a king or a close associate, such as one of the king's favoured warriors, and may have possibly been the sword of King Oswald of Northumbria. The weapon would have been passed down a family line until its burial some three to four hundred years later. =Rediscovery= The sword was unearthed by Brian Hope-Taylor during a dig inside the walls of Bamburgh Castle, Northumberland, in 1960. However, the sword wasn't recognised and he took possession of the artefact. Following Hope-Taylor's death in 2001, a former PhD student of his was checking a consignment of items from Hope-Taylor's house that were due to be disposed of in a skip and found the sword. A number of students had visited their former professor's house only because they had heard that his books were being sold off. The sword had been stored inside a suitcase that was found in the garage. After being researched by Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland, the sword was returned to the castle in 2005, and remains there on display.

Early years and education  Mary was the eldest daughter of William Henry Gaunt, a Victorian county court judge and Elizabeth Palmer, and was born in Chiltern, Victoria. She was educated at Grenville College, Ballarat and the University of Melbourne, being one of the first two women students to enroll there. Career She began writing for the press and in 1894 published her first novel Dave's Sweetheart. In the same year she married Dr Hubert Lindsay Miller (a widower) of Warrnambool, Victoria. He died in 1900, and, with only a small income, Gaunt (now also known as Mrs Mary Miller) went to London intending to earn a living by her writing. Gaunt left Melbourne on 15 March 1901. Gaunt had difficulties at first but eventually established herself, and was able to travel in the West Indies, in West Africa, and in China and other parts of the East. Her experiences were recorded in five pleasantly written travel books: Alone in West Africa (1912), A Woman in China (1914), A Broken Journey (1919), Where the Twain Meet (1922), Reflection - in Jamaica (1932). In 1929 she also published George Washington and the Men Who Made the American Revolution. Between 1895 and 1934, 16 novels or collections of short stories were published, mostly with love and adventure interests. Three other novels were written in collaboration with John Ridgwell Essex. A collection of interviews with Mary were published in the 1925 Girls' Own Annual under the headings \\"Pioneering for Women\\" parts I, II, and III, and \\"Strange Journeys I Have Made\\". From the early 1920s, Gaunt lived mostly at Bordighera, Italy. In 1940 she fled Italy and died at Cannes in 1942. She had no children. Sister Lucy, brothers Cecil, Clive, Guy and Ernest were both Admirals of the Royal Navy, and Guy later became a Conservative Member of Parliament.

It is found from the southern United States in Texas, and in the northeastern Mexico in the states of Nuevo Le√≥n, Tamaulipas, San Luis Potos√≠, Hidalgo, and Veracruz. Its range in Texas has expanded because of transport in potted plants, and there is also a likely introduced population in Louisiana. Subspecies Two subspecies are sometimes recognized, although they are poorly delineated: Only Eleutherodactylus cystignathoides campi occurs in Texas. Description Rio Grande Chirping Frog (Eleutherodactylus cystignathoides), from Liberty County, Texas, USA Adult males measure and adult females in snout‚Äìvent length. The snout is pointed and the body is flat and elongated. Tympanum is visible. The finger tips are slightly expanded. Dorsal skin is weakly pustular, that of venter is smooth to areolate. Dorsal coloration is variable (brown, gray, or yellow-green) and includes dark spots. Ventral skin is translucent. The hind limbs have dark crossbars. Behavior Both males and females produce calls, which is rare in anurans. Moreover, male and female calls are remarkably similar. A smaller proportion of females compared to males were observed calling in two Mexican populations. Moreover, calling females were, on average, smaller than non-calling females. The function of female calling is not known, but it might function as an advertisement, similarly as the male calls. Males appear to be territorial. Reproduction Reproduction is terrestrial and direct, without a free-living larval stage. Under laboratory conditions, eggs are laid just under the soil surface. Clutch size is 5‚Äì13 eggs measuring in diameter. The eggs hatch as froglets that measure approximately . Habitat and conservation Eleutherodactylus cystignathoides occurs at low elevation coastal plains and at low to moderate elevations in foothills. Individuals can be found in moist shaded vegetation, palm groves, thickets, ditches, resacas, lawns, and gardens. Many records are from urban settings. They can hide under cover objects during the day. They have been observed to utilize arboreal perches above the ground. This species is quite common throughout its range and no major threats to it are known; rather, they appear to thrive in the presence of humans. Its Mexican range includes Sierra del Abra-Tamchipa and El Cielo Biosphere Reserves.

Canal boats are now moored on the remaining part of the water, from the Amstel to Grimburgwal. History Originally the Rokin was a section of the river Amstel, and was known then as Ruck-in (from 'inrukken', which means 'to withdraw', as some of the houses on the Amstel had to be shortened to construct the quays there in the 16th century).Rokin na twee jar weer geopend (in Dutch), Het Parool, 16 September 2017.

The commodities exchange, designed by Hendrick de Keyser, played a key part in the economic success of the city during the Dutch Golden Age. The building was demolished in 1835. During the ongoing construction of the North-South line, a new metro line, archeologists dug down to a depth of approximately 20 meters on the Rokin.

A five- mile section of SR 305 is the site of a yearly human-powered vehicle (HPV) speed record competition conducted by the IHPVA (International Human Powered Vehicle Association), with the record set to 89.59 mph (144.18 km/h) on September 17, 2016. During repaving in 2009, special attention was paid to the five mile stretch to make sure it was the flattest and smoothest road in the world. It is very slightly downhill, with an average slope of less than 2/3 of one percent, per IHPVA rules. History The road dates to back to at least 1929. At that time, it appeared on state maps one segment of the much longer State Route 8A. At the time, it was an unimproved road in the state highway system, and the road approached Battle Mountain from a more southerly direction. The northern end of the current highway alignment southwest of Battle Mountain, serving the present-day mining establishments near the town, was constructed by 1952, although SR 8A continued to follow the previous alignment according to maps. The entire highway was paved by 1953, and the SR 8A designation was moved onto the newer section near Battle Mountain by 1954. On July 1, 1976, Nevada began renumbering its state highways. In this process, the Austin - Battle Mountain Road segment of SR 8A was reassigned to a new State Route 305. This change was first seen on state maps in 1978. The route has remained relatively unchanged since then.

Lymphomas are \\"blood cancers\\" in the lymph nodes. They develop more frequently in older adults and in immunocompromised individuals. B-cell lymphomas include both Hodgkin's lymphomas and most non-Hodgkin lymphomas. They are typically divided into low and high grade, typically corresponding to indolent (slow-growing) lymphomas and aggressive lymphomas, respectively. As a generalisation, indolent lymphomas respond to treatment and are kept under control (in remission) with long-term survival of many years, but are not cured. Aggressive lymphomas usually require intensive treatments, with some having a good prospect for a permanent cure.Merck Manual home edition, Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas Prognosis and treatment depends on the specific type of lymphoma as well as the stage and grade. Treatment includes radiation and chemotherapy. Early-stage indolent B-cell lymphomas can often be treated with radiation alone, with long-term non-recurrence. Early-stage aggressive disease is treated with chemotherapy and often radiation, with a 70-90% cure rate. Late- stage indolent lymphomas are sometimes left untreated and monitored until they progress. Late-stage aggressive disease is treated with chemotherapy, with cure rates of over 70%.

Classic Hodgkin's lymphoma and nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma are now considered forms of B-cell lymphoma. Associated chromosomal translocations Chromosomal translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy locus (IGH@) is a classic cytogenetic abnormality for many B-cell lymphomas, including follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and Burkitt's lymphoma. In these cases, the immunoglobulin heavy locus forms a fusion protein with another protein that has pro-proliferative or anti- apoptotic abilities. The enhancer element of the immunoglobulin heavy locus, which normally functions to make B cells produce massive production of antibodies, now induces massive transcription of the fusion protein, resulting in excessive pro-proliferative or anti-apoptotic effects on the B cells containing the fusion protein. In Burkitt's lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma, the other protein in the fusion is c-myc (on chromosome 8) and cyclin D1 (on chromosome 11), respectively, which gives the fusion protein pro-proliferative ability. In follicular lymphoma, the fused protein is Bcl-2 (on chromosome 18), which gives the fusion protein anti-apoptotic abilities.

Almost all other tyes of lymphoma involve the proliferation and accumulation of malignant lymphocytes in lymph nodes, other parts of the lymphatic system (e.g. the spleen), and various non-lymphatic organs (e.g. bone marrow and liver) but not in blood vessels. IVL fall into three different forms based on the type of lymphocyte causing the disease. Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVBCL), which constitutes ~90% of all IVL, is a lymphoma of malignant B-cell lymphocytes as classified by the World Health Organization, 2016. The remaining IVL types, which have not yet been formally classified by the World Health Organization, are defined based mainly on case reports; these IVL are 1) intravascular NK- cell lymphoma (IVNKL) in which the malignant cells are a type of T cell lymphocyte termed natural killer cells (NK-cells) and 2) intravascular T-cell lymphoma (IVTL) in which the neoplastic cells are primarily, if not exclusively, a type of t-cell termed cytotoxic T-cells. Because of their similarities and extreme rarities, IVL lymphomas caused by NK-cells and cytotoxic T-cells are often grouped together under the term intravascular NK/T cell lymphomas (IVNK/TL). The malignant cells in IVNK/TL are typically infected with the Epstein-Barr virus suggesting that these lymphomas are examples of the Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases. Since infection with this virus is rarely seen in IVBCL, this form of IVL is not typically regarded as one of the Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases. Intravascular large B-cell and intravascular NK/T cell IVL are typically very aggressive lymphomas that afflict middle-aged and elderly adults. At the time of diagnosis, they accumulate within small- sized and medium-sized but not large-sized blood vessels of the skin, central nervous system, and, less frequently. virtually any other organ system. Unlike most lymphomas, however, they generally do not accumulate or infiltrate lymph nodes. All of the IVL are frequently associated with systemic B symptoms such as fever and weight loss, as well as symptoms related to the other organs in which they accumulate in blood vessels, constrict blood flow, and thereby cause severe damage due to infarction, i.e. damage due to the loss of blood flow. Historically, most cases of the intravascular lymphomas responded very poorly to standard chemotherapy regimens that were used to treat other types of the B-cell lymphomas. With few exceptions, these intravascular lymphomas progressed very rapidly. More recently, however, the addition to these chemotherapy regimens of the immunotherapy agents, Rituximab, which acts to kill B-cells, has greatly improved their effectiveness and thereby the prognosis of the most common form of these diseases, the intravascular B-cell lymphomas. Unfortunately, no such agent that is directed against NK-cells or cytotoxic T-cells has yet been reported to be useful in treating these two types of the intravascular B-cell lymphomas.  History  In 1959, Pfleger and Tappeiner first reported on a cancer in which malignant cells grew uncontrollably within the lumen of blood vessels; the authors suggested that these malignant cells were derived from the endothelial cells lining the vasculature and therefore termed the disorder angioendotheliomatosis proliferans systemisata. Subsequent studies reported in 1982, 1985, and 1986 led to the conclusion that these malignant cells were derived from lymphocytes rather than endothelial cells. These along with other studies termed the disease angioendotheliomatosis, neoplastic angiotheliomatosis, intravascular lymphomatosis, angioendotheliotropic (intravascular) lymphoma, angiotropic large-cell lymphoma, diffuse large-cell lymphoma, intralymphatic lymphomatosis, and, less specifically, malignant angioendotheliomatosis or intravascular lymphoma. By 20001, the World Health Organization had defined the disease as a malignant B-cell lymphoma termed intravascular large B-cell lymphoma. Santucci et al. first reported a case of IVL that involved malignant NK cells. Some 2 dozen other cases of intravascular NK cell lymphoma have been reported by 2018. In 2008, 29 case reports of purported intravascular T-cell lymphoma were reviewed; only two of these cases were associated with evidence strongly suggesting that the malignant cells were cytotoxic T-cells. Subsequently, a few more cases of cytotoxic T-cell-based have been reported. There remains a possibility that future studies will find other T-cell types may cause IVTCL.  Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma  Intravascular large B-cell lymphomas fall into three distinct variants, all of which involve the intravascular accumulation of malignant B-cells and appear to have a similar pathophysiology. However, they differ in the distribution of their lesions, types of populations afflicted, prognoses, and treatments. These three variants are: 1) intravascular large B-cell lymphoma classical, 2) intravascular large B-cell lymphoma, cutaneous variant, and 3) intravasclar large B-cell lymphoma, hemophagocytic syndrome-associated variant. The following sections give the common pathophysiology of the three variants and then describes the lesions, populations afflicted, prognoses, and treatments of each variant in separate sections. = Pathophysiology of the intravascular B-cell lymphomas = The gene, chromosome, and gene expression abnormalities in IVBCL have not been fully evaluated. Studies to date indicate that the malignant cells in this disease have mutations in their MYD88 (44% of cases) and CD79B (26% of cases) genes. The exact mutation seen in the MYD88 (i.e. L265P) and some or the mutations in CD79B occur in diverse types of lymphoma. Other abnormalities seen in the small numbers of cases that have been studied so far include translocations between chromosome 14 and 18; tandem triplications of both the BCL2 gene located on the long arm of chromosome 18 at position q21 and the KMT2A gene located on the long arm of chromosome 11 between positions 22 and 25. The product protein of BCL2 viz., Bcl-2, regulates cell survival and apoptosis (i.e. programmed cell death) and the product protein of KMT2a viz., MLL regulates cell maturation. Abnormalities in BCL2 and KMT2A are associated with other types of B-cell lymphomas. It seems likely that these or other gene, chromosome, and/or gene expression abnormalities contribute to the development and/or progression of IVBCL. The malignant B-cells in IVBCL fail to express the CD29 protein while the endothelial cells in close proximity to the intravascular accumulations of the malignant B-cells fail to express key CXC chemokine receptor proteins particularly CxcL12 but also Cxcr5, Ccr6, and/or Ccr7. The failure of the endothelial cells to express these receptor proteins may be due to the action of nearby malignant B-cells. In any event, all of the cited proteins are involved in the movement of B-cells from the intravascular space across the vascular endothelium and into tissues. The lack of these proteins may explain the accumulation of the malignant B-cells of IVLBC within blood vessels. In about 80% of cases, the malignant B-cells in IVBCL are \\"non-germinal center B-cells\\" as defined by the Hans algorithm rather than the \\"germinal center B-cells\\" that are commonly found in less aggressive B-cell lymphomas. This factor may contribute to the aggressiveness of IVBCL. = Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma, classical variant =  Presentation  Individuals presenting with the classical variant of IVLBL are typically middle-aged or elderly (39‚Äì90 years) that have one or more of the following: systemic symptoms, particularly fever (45% of cases); cutaneous lesions (40%); central nervous system disorders (35%); and clinical and laboratory abnormalities involving the bone marrow (~18%), lung (~6%), and, rarely, endocrine glands (e.g. pituitary, thyroid, adrenal gland), liver, prostate, uterus, eye, intestine, and in individual cases almost any other organ or tissue. These findings are based primarily on studies of 740 patients conducted in Europe; a study conducted in Quebec, Canada on 29 patients gave similar results. Individuals may present with one, two, or more of these abnormalities. Systemic symptoms include not only the most commonly seen one viz., fever, but also malaise, weight loss, and other B symptoms; the cutaneous lesions include singular or multiple plaques, nodules, tumors, and ulcerations, some of which may be painful and most of which are located on the breast, lower abdomen, and/or extremities. Central nervous system defects include sensory and/or motor neuropathy, spinal nerve root pain, paresthesia, hypoesthesia, aphasia, dysarthria, hemiparesis, seizures, myoclonus, transient visual loss, vertigo, altered conscious states, and, particularly in relapsed disease, neurolymphomatosis (i.e. direct invasion of a nerve(s) in the peripheral nervous system by the malignant B-cells). Laboratory studies generally show non-specific abnormalities: elevated levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase and soluble IL2RA; anemia, decreases in blood platelet levels, and decreases in white blood cell levels in 25%->50% of cases. Circulating malignant B-cells are not found in 90-95% of cases and laboratory evidence of organ injury is found in those cases involving these organs.  Diagnosis  The diagnosis of IVBCL is heavily dependent upon obtaining biopsy specimens from involved tissues, particularly the skin but in cases without skin lesions, other apparently involved tissues. Microscopic examination of these tissues typically shows medium-sized to large-sized lymphocytes located within small- to medium-sized blood vessels of the skin, lung, and other tissues or the sinusoids of the liver, bone marrow, and spleen. On occasion, these malignant cells have the appearance of Reed-Sternberg cells. The lesions should show no or very little extension outside of blood vessels. As determined by immunohistochemistry analyses, the intravascular malignant lymphocytes express typical B-cell proteins, particularly CD20, which is found in almost all cases, CD79a and Pax5, which are found in most cases, and MUM1 and Bcl-2, which are found in 95% and 91% of cases, respectively. These B-cells are usually (80% of cases) non-germinal center B-cells (see Pathophysiology section) and may express one or more of the gene, chromosome, and gene expression abnormalities described in the above Pathophysiology section. Since the classical variant can present with a wide range of clinical signs, symptoms, and organ involvements, its presence may not be apparent, particularly in cases that do not exhibit clinically apparent skin lesions. Accordingly, random skin biopsies have been used to obtain evidence of IVL in cases that have signs and/or symptoms of the disease that are restricted to non-cutaneous sites, even in cases that present with no other finding except unexplained fever. The diagnosis of IVBCL, classical variant is solidified by finding these pathological features in more than one site.  Treatment and prognosis  At diagnosis, IVBCL must be regarded as an aggressive and disseminated malignancy requiring systemic chemotherapy. In the absence of long- or short-term, controlled clinical trials on treating this lymphoma, individuals with IVBCL have been treated with the standard regimen used to treat diffuse large B-cell lymphomas viz., the CHOP chemotherapy regimen which consists of cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin (also termed doxorubicin or adriamycin), oncovin (also teremed vincristine), and a corticosteroid (i.e. either prednisone or prednisolone) plus the monoclonal antibody immunotherapy agent, Rituximab. This immunochemotherapeutic regimen has achieved an overall survival rate at 3 years of 81%; this overall survival rate using CHOP before Retuximab was added to the regimen was only 33%. However, highly toxic reactions to Rituximab such as pulmonary failure may occur and require delay or interrupting the use of this drug. High dose chemotherapy regimens followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation has offered clinical improvement similar to that found with the CHOP plus Rituximabn. However, only a small percentage of patients with IVBCL are young and healthy enough to receive this regimen. Intravenous methotrexate may be a useful addition to the rituximab- CHOP regiment in individuals with central nervous system involvement. = Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma, cutaneous variant =  Presentation  The cutaneous variant, which comprises a small percentage of all IVBCL cases, occurs almost exclusively in females and younger individuals (median age 59 years) than the classical variant (median age 72 years). Individuals present with lesions that are exclusively or greatly confined to the skin. The clinical features of these lesions are similar to those described in the section on Presentation of the classical variant. Individuals with the cutaneous variant may have systemic symptoms but this occurs less frequently (30% of cases) than those in the classical variant (45% of cases). In general, cutaneous variant patients are in much better physical shape than those with other forms of IVBCL and have a better long-term prognosis.  diagnosis  The diagnosis of IVL, cutaneous variant depends on finding the pathological picture in the skin as described for the classical variant except that the lesions occur exclusively or predominantly in the skin. Ideally, these pathological findings should be found in more than one skin site. However, cutaneous involvement is frequently detected in a single site such as the hypervascular lesions of cherry hemangiomas and angiolipomas.  Treatment and prognosis  Historically, individuals with the cutaneous variant survive significantly longer than that those with the classical variant (3 year overall survival 56% versus 22%). Early intervention in the cutaneous variant would appear to be highly desirable. Virtually all reports on the treatment of the cutaneous variant were made before Rituximab was used to treat IVL. Historically, patients with localized disease obtained prolonged remission with conventional CHOP therapy. However, individuals with single cutaneous lesions were long‚Äêterm survivors: when treated with just radiation therapy or surgical removal, these single-lesion patients had prolonged remissions both at initial diagnosis and after relapse. In contrast, patients with multiple lesions had a far worse outcome after treatment with CHOP: they had an objective response in 86% of cases but nonetheless the majority relapsed within a year of treatment with and only a few being successfully managed with salvage chemotherapy. Rituximab may improve the latter situation. = Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma, hemophagocytic syndrome-associated variant =  Presentation  The hemophagocytic syndrome-associated variant of IVBCL is a very rare variant of IVBCL. Its previous name, intravascular large B-cell lymphoma, Asian variant, was recently changed to its current name by the world Health Organization, 2016. Unlike the classical and cutaneous variants, the hemophagocytic syndrome-associated variant presents with the hemophagocytic syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by bone marrow involvement, reduced numbers of circulating blood platelets as well as the reduced levels of other circulating blood cells, and enlarged liver and spleen. Less often, it is also associated with overt hemophagocytosis (i.e. the engulfment by non-malignant histiocytes of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and their precursor cells that is most commonly found in the bone marrow and other tissues. The syndrome often reflects excessive secretion of inflammatory cytokines and severe systemic inflammation similar to that seen in the cytokine storm syndrome. In general, individuals present with a rapidly progressive disease (median time from onset to diagnosis~4 weeks, range 2‚Äì12 weeks). Patients are often extremely ill and suffer from multiple organ failures.  Diagnosis  The diagnosis of the intravascular large B-cell lymphoma, hemophagocytic syndrome-associated variant depends on the individual presenting with clinical and laboratory findings compatible with the hemphagocytic syndrome (see previous section) and on the histology of biopsied tissue(s) of the bone marrow, spleen, liver, brain, or other organ that clinical and/or laboratory findings suggest are involved in the disease. Its histology is described in the Diagnosis section of the classical variant but also includes the presence of hemophagocytosis, i.e. the engulfment of red blood cells and/or other mature and immature blood cells. Hemophagocytosis can also be found in sites removed from the intravascular lesions such as the cerebrospinal fluid in patients with central nervous system involvement.  Treatment and prognosis  Prior to the use of rituximab, individuals with this variant generally followed a rapidly (i.e. weeks to months) fatal course even when treated with the CHOP regimen. However, addition of rituximab to the CHOP regimen appears to have improved the treatment of this disease. Intravenous methotrexate may be a useful addition to the rituximab-CHOP regiment in individuals with central nervous system involvement.  Intravascular NK/T cell lymphomas  = Pathophysiology = Three studies have examine gene mutations and gene expression abnormalities in IVNK/TL. A retrospective study of 25 patients identified numerous gene abnormalities including tumor-specific splicing alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes such as HRAS, MDM2, and VEGFA as well as premature termination mutations or copy number losses in a total of 15 splicing-regulator genes such as SF3B5 and TNPO3. A study of two patients with IVNKL identified mutations in genes that produce histone proteins (HIST1H2BE, HIST1H2BN and H3F3A), the histone deacetylase gene, HDAC5, two genes that produce helicase proteins (WRN and DDX3X), two genes that make DNA methylation-related enzymes (TET2 and DNMT1) and a gene in the SWI/SNF family of chromatin remodeling genes, ARID1A. In a third study of a single patient, copy number analysis identified driver gene alterations in ARID1B, HACE1, and SMAD4 genes and gain of the SOX2 gene. While further studies are needed before conclusions can be made, one or more of these gene abnormalities may contribute to the development and/or progression of IVNK/TL. The malignant NK and T cells that accurmulate within the vascular of individuals with IVNK/TL are usually infected with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This suggests that most IVNK/TL cases are examples of the Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases and, like these diseases, are EBV-driven. About 95% of the world's population is infected with EBV. During the initial infection, the virus may cause infectious mononucleosis, only minor non-specific symptoms, or no symptoms. Regardless of this, the virus enters a latency phase and the infected individual becomes a lifetime asymptomatic carrier of EBV. Weeks, months, years, or decades thereafter, a small percentage of these carriers develop an EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease, including in extremely rare cases IVNK/TL. EBV is well known to infect NK- and T-cells, to express some of its genes that promote the survival and proliferation of the cells it infects, and thereby to cause various and far more common NK- and T-cell lymphomas. It seems likely that the virus acts similarly to cause IVNK/TL. IVNK/TL may differ from the other types of NK- and T-cell lymphomas which EBV produces because its NK- and T-cells and nearby endothelial cells have defects in the expression of proteins required for the NK/T-cells to pass through the endothelium and into the surrounding tissues (see above section on the Pathopysiology IVBCL). = Presentation = Individuals (age range 23‚Äì81 years) with IVNK/TL typically have a rapidly progressive disease. They commonly present with skin lesions, less commonly symptoms due to central nervous system involvement, and in a minority of cases symptoms due to the involvement of the bone marrow, liver, kidneys, ovaries, and/or cervix. They often show signs of an disseminated disease such as fever, weight loss, night sweats, arthralgias, jaundice, decreased numbers of circulating red blood cells, white blood cells, and/or platelets, bone marrow involvement as determined by biopsy, and signs/symptoms of multiple organ involvement. = Diagnosis = The diagnosis of IVNK/TL depends upon obtaining histology findings in the skin and/or other involved tissue that resembles that seen in IVBCL except that the malignant lymphocytes are not B-cells but rather: 1) NK-cells as evidenced by their expression of NK-cell selective marker proteins (e.g. CD3e, CD2, CD30, CD43, CD56, and/or CD79), expression of granule-bound enzymes (e.g. granzyme B), and expression of EBV proteins (e.g. Epstein‚ÄìBarr virus latent membrane protein 1 and EBV- produced small RNAs); but not the expression of B-cell (e.g. CD20, CD79a, and Pax5) or cytotoxic T cell marker proteins; and 2) cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma as evidenced by the neoplastic cells' expression of T-cell co-receptor proteins (e.g. CD3, CD4, and/or CD8) as well as EBV marker proteins and/or small RNAs but usually not B-cell or NK-cell marker proteins. = Treatment and Prognosis = Patients with IVNK/TL have been treated with various chemotherapy regimens, particularly CHOP or, less commonly, hyperCVAD. Rare patients have been treated with chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or chemotherapy plus a proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib. In general, patients have responded poorly to treatment, have short (i.e. up to 12 months) survival times regardless of the chemotherapy regeimen used. Rituximab does not target NK- or T-cells and therefore is not used to treat IVNK/TL.

Agresti has also received several awards for his look at the urban makeup of his birthplace in Buenos Aires Vice Versa, including Best Screenplay and Best Editing from the Argentine Film Critics Association, the Special Jury Prize at the Havana Film Festival, and three awards from Argentina‚Äôs Mar del Plata International Film Festival. Un mundo menos peor (\\"A Less Bad World\\") premiered at the 2004 Venice Film Festival and was awarded the \\"Award of the City of Rome\\" Best Film prize. Born in 1961, Agresti made his directorial debut while still a teenager with 1978‚Äôs El Zool√≥gico y el cementerio, a short film he shot on weekends while working as a TV director in Buenos Aires. Longing to broaden his horizons, he immigrated to the Netherlands, where he exhibited El Hombre que gan√≥ la raz√≥n at the International Film Festival of Rotterdam in 1986. After establishing himself in the Netherlands, he continued his burgeoning career with such projects as Love is a Fat Woman which won the Special Jury Prize at the 1988 Nederlands Film Festival and the Best New Director award at the San Sebastian International Film Festival, and Secret Wedding which won the Golden Calf for Best Film award at the Nederlands Film Festival, among other international awards. Other popular Agresti films include La cruz (\\"The Cross\\"), the story about a film critic whose job loss precipitates a family crisis; the popular comedy A Night With Sabrina Love, the tale of a teenager who unexpectedly wins an evening with a famous porn star in a television contest; City Life, Luba, Figaro Stories, Everybody Wants to Help Ernest, A Lonely Race, Modern Crimes, and El Acto en cuesti√≥n (\\"The Act in Question\\"), which won more than a dozen international film awards.

The film stars John Cusack, who co-wrote the screenplay with Agresti. Paul Hipp co-stars, and Al Pacino is featured in a cameo. No somos animales was only shown in its workprint form in a few special projections at Argentina and the US; according to Agresti, a dispute between the film's producer and John Cusack (and Cusack's lawyer as well) has left the film in a limbo state, and it is still unclear when the theatrical cut will be released.Alejandro Agresti: ‚ÄúThe Argentine man polishes himself with his culture\\" - An interview by Rolando Gallego 2015-11-04, Escribiendo Cine In 2016 he released Mec√°nica popular, an Argentine comedy-drama film he wrote and directed, starring Alejandro Awada and Patricio Contreras.

Early life Kenny Blatchford was born in Minnedosa, Manitoba. He was educated at a commercial college, and was an excellent wrestler and all-around athlete as a youth. He moved to Edmonton with his parents by ox-cart during the 1890s, and began selling newspapers. During the Klondike Gold Rush, he took over operation of the grist mill operated by Daniel Fraser, and later worked in the Edmonton Power Plant. He married Grace Lauder Walker on 19 December 1904, with whom he would have two sons and a daughter. Kenny Blatchford was a member of the Presbyterian Church in Canada. Municipal politics Blatchford first sought public office in the 1921 municipal election, when he was elected to Edmonton City Council for a one-year term as an alderman, finishing fifth out of seventeen candidates. While the top five candidates were to have been elected to two year terms, with the sixth and seventh-place finishers winning one year terms, Bickerton Pratt, who finished seventh, won a two-year term by virtue of being from the south side of the North Saskatchewan River; resultingly, Blatchford won only a one-year term. He was re-elected, this time to a two-year term, in the 1922 election, in which he finished third of sixteen candidates. He resigned midway through his term to run for mayor in the 1923 election, in which he handily defeated James Ramsey. He was re-elected with relative ease in the 1924 and 1925 elections, and did not seek re-election thereafter. As mayor, Blatchford convinced the city to purchase a farm to establish an \\"air harbour\\", which would later become the Edmonton City Centre (Blatchford Field) Airport. After his federal political career faltered, Blatchford attempted a return to municipal office by running for mayor in the 1932 election. However, he finished a distant third of three candidates, behind incumbent Daniel Kennedy Knott and perennial candidate (and former and future mayor) Joseph Clarke. Federal politics While still mayor, Blatchford ran for the House of Commons of Canada in the 1926 election as a Liberal in Edmonton East. He defeated incumbent Conservative Member of Parliament Ambrose Bury by fewer than two hundred votes. He served until 1930, when he was defeated by Bury (who had gone on to succeed Blatchford as mayor of Edmonton) in that year's election. Death and legacy Five months after his defeat in the 1932 mayoral election, Blatchford suffered a nervous breakdown and disappeared. His body was found in the North Saskatchewan River on April 22, 1933 after he had been missing for two days. His death was ruled a suicide. His son, Howard Peter \\"Cowboy\\" Blatchford went on to become a flying ace in the Royal Canadian Air Force during the Second World War. Blatchford Field, location of the former Edmonton City Centre Airport, was named after Kenny Blatchford. The carbon neutral community of Blatchford, which is being developed on the grounds of the former airport, is named in his honour.

It connects the mining area of Gold Acres in Lander County to Interstate 80 (I-80) at the Beowawe Interchange near Beowawe in Eureka County via Crescent Valley. The road has been a state highway since the 1920s, having been established as part of a much longer State Route 21 by 1929. Route description View along SR 306, north of Beowawe, looking southbound, May 2014 SR 306 begins at the road to Barrack Cortez Mine, just east of Gold Acres in central Lander County. From this point, the route heads in a north- northeasterly direction, away from the mountains of the Shoshone Range. After about , the highway crosses into Eureka County and passes through the small community of Crescent Valley. Passing through the town, SR 306 continues on its straight course northward through the valley of the same name. The route reaches the town of Beowawe, where it crosses over the Union Pacific Railroad, and soon after, bridges the Humboldt River. The highway passes briefly through Whirlwind Valley before reaching Interstate 80, where SR 306 terminates at the Beowawe Interchange (exit 261). History SR 306 used to be part of State Route 21 The road dates back to at least 1929. At that time, it was part of a longer State Route 21 which extended north from SR 2/U.S. Route 50 (US 50) near Austin all the way through Crescent Valley and Beowawe to SR 1/US 40 (now I-80). By 1933, the southern end of SR 21 had been extended beyond Austin, branching from US 50 just west of town and heading in a southwesterly direction towards Ione. Not counting the brief overlap with US 50, the total length of State Route 21 was around . The entire route remained a dirt or gravel-graded route until about 1958, when the northern between Gold Point and US 40 were paved. Aside from a little more paving south of Gold Point, SR 21 remained unchanged into the 1970s. However, on July 1, 1976, Nevada began a renumbering of its state highways. In this process, the paved portion of the highway between Crescent Valley and US 40/I-80 north of Beowawe was redesignated as State Route 306. This change was first seen on state maps in 1978. The rest of SR 21 remained on official Nevada maps for a short time, but was ultimately removed from the state highway system by 1982. The paved highway extending to the Gold Acres site wasn't shown on state maps until 1993. The route has remained relatively unchanged since.

It is part of the North Shore Railroad System. The line is along the right bank of the West Branch Susquehanna River, roughly following U.S. Route 15 between the unincorporated village of Winfield in southern Union County and the village of New Columbia (in White Deer Township) in northern Union County. Other communities served by the UCIR include Lewisburg, the village of West Milton (in Kelly Township), and Milton (east across the West Branch Susquehanna River in Northumberland County). Although the UCIR has no employees and owns none of the track on which it operates, its corporate offices are located in Northumberland, Pennsylvania. There is a connection to the Norfolk Southern Railway line at Milton. Robey Railroads, a private company, operates the Union County Industrial Railroad. The Union County Industrial Railroad has no employees, instead they are provided by the North Shore Railroad. This led the Railroad Retirement Board to find that \\"the Union County Industrial Railroad is not an employer subject to the Railroad Retirement and Railroad Unemployment Insurance Acts.\\" The North Shore Railroad System has trackage rights via the Norfolk Southern line. These allow the Union County Industrial Railroad to connect to the north and west with the Lycoming Valley Railroad (at Muncy and Linden), the Nittany and Bald Eagle Railroad (at Lock Haven) and, to the south, with the North Shore Railroad (at Northumberland) and the Shamokin Valley Railroad (at Sunbury). Union County rail lines Map of the Union County Industrial Railroad (red), Norfolk Southern Railway (blue), and out of service (green) lines in Union County. Rail trail is purple. There are basically two rail lines in Union County (although they have five different owners as of 2006): #the former \\"Reading Williamsport Line\\" from Winfield to Allenwood (north- south along the river); #the former \\"Reading Catawissa Branch\\" from West Milton east to Milton (east-west crossing the river); All of the lines in Union County passed into the possession of Conrail, and were eventually abandoned or sold by it or its successors. Although the UCIR has a contract to operate on these lines between Winfield and Allenwood, and West Milton and Milton, as of 2008, the line from New Columbia north to Allenwood is out of service on account of bad track. The UCIR formerly operated the West Shore Railroad (reporting mark WTSE) from Lewisburg to Mifflinburg, but service ended in 1997 and the line was sold to become a rail trail in 2008. As of 2006, ownership of the lines in Union County is as follows: The north-south former \\"Reading Williamsport Line\\" along the river is divided into four sections with three owners: *The \\"Lewisburg and Buffalo Creek Railroad\\" (LBCX) owns the track from Winfield north to West Milton. It is a non-operating railroad, although a tourist service operated on this track until the mid-1990s. As of 2006, this track is used by the UCIR for freight services. *The \\"West Shore Railroad Corporation\\" (WSRC) owns the track from Milton, through West Milton north to New Columbia, terminating just north of Interstate 80. This track is also used by the UCIR. *The \\"White Deer and Reading Railroad\\" (WDRR, owned by SEDA-COG JRA) owns the track from just north of Interstate 80 north to the village of White Deer (across the river from Watsontown).

He attended Stratford Technical High School, playing for the First XV 1952-1954, and went on from there to be selected to the Taranaki side. He alternated between first five- eighths and second five-eighths, weighing in at 75 kg and measuring 1.73 m high. McCullough was known for his good hands, his deft turn of speed and his strong defence. McCullough was part of a Taranaki team that still holds a special place in the history of that province. He was part of the side that drew 3-all with the Springboks in 1956, as well as the successful Ranfurly Shield triumph over Otago in 1957 and the subsequent two-year possession of the shield. McCullough made his first All Black trial appearance in 1956, and in 1959 finally found the favour of the All Black selectors for the second, third and fourth tests against the touring British Lions, playing at first five-eighths. McCullough was overlooked for the 1960 tour of South Africa, however, and the 1959 matches proved to be the only games he played for the All Blacks.

He was a member of the South Australian House of Assembly on four occasions: from 1861 to 1862 for City of Adelaide, from 1865 to 1870 for West Adelaide (1865‚Äì1868) and The Burra (1868‚Äì1870), from 1871 to 1878 for West Torrens (1871‚Äì1875) and Encounter Bay (1875‚Äì1878), and a final stint in Encounter Bay in 1878. At 34 years and 150 days of age, Boucaut was the youngest person to have been appointed Premier of South Australia. He was Premier three times: from 1866 to 1867, from 1875 to 1876, and from 1877 to 1878. He was Attorney-General of South Australia under Premiers John Hart and Henry Ayers, and served variously as Attorney-General, Treasurer, Commissioner of Public Works and Commissioner of Crown Lands and Immigration in his own ministries. He left politics in 1878 when he was appointed a judge of the Supreme Court of South Australia, serving until his retirement in 1905. Early life Boucaut was born in Mylor, Cornwall, the eldest son of a navy officer, Captain Ray Boucaut, and his wife, Winifred, daughter of James Penn, superintendent of the royal dockyard at Falmouth. He was educated at the Rev. Mr Hayley's school at Saltash. Career in Australia Boucaut left with his parents for South Australia in 1846, and after some work as a stockman in the interior, returned to Adelaide and entered the legal profession. Boucaut was articled to Charles Fenn, and was admitted to the bar in November 1855, his career was a lawyer was successful. He first took over the practice of Josiah Partridge in partnership with one Herford, which dissolved around 1860. A partnership with William James Wren was cut short by the latter's death on 6 February 1864. In December 1861 he was returned to the South Australian House of Assembly as a representative for the City of Adelaide district, but was defeated at the general election in 1862. In March 1865 he was elected for West Adelaide at the head of the poll. In October he became Attorney-General in the first Hart ministry, and when the premier retired to go to England in February 1866, Boucaut took his place in a reconstructed ministry which was in power until May 1867. Boucaut was narrowly defeated in the 1868 election for East Adelaide, but a few days later on 15 April he was returned unopposed for The Burra, where his father-in-law, Alexander McCulloch, stood down in his favour. He badly lost the 1869 election for The Burra but entered the house again as member for West Torrens in the by-election of 1871. In January 1872 he became Attorney-General in Ayers' sixth ministry, but retired when the cabinet was reconstructed early in March. From 22 February 1875 to 25 September 1878 Boucaut represented Encounter Bay, and on 3 June 1875 Boucaut formed his second ministry, in which he was commissioner of crown lands and immigration. An education bill was successfully taken through the assembly, and in September Boucaut brought in a bill authorizing the raising of a loan of ¬£3,000,000 for the construction or extension of 13 lines of railway and various other public works. But opposition in the council, and the fear of increased taxation, temporarily held up railway extensions. The cabinet was reconstructed in March 1876, but resigned early in the following June. The ministry of John Colton, which followed, adopted part of Boucaut's railway extension policy and succeeded in carrying it through. Boucaut formed his third ministry in October 1877 and became Treasurer of South Australia. During the following nine months some useful legislation was passed, including a crown lands consolidation bill, and provision for several railway lines and for the improvement of Victor Harbour. An income tax bill was defeated, but a property tax of threepence in the pound was agreed to. In September 1878, on the death of Justice Stow, Boucaut was appointed a judge of the Supreme Court of South Australia. Boucaut was a judge for 27 years. It was at first thought that he could not be content to be out of politics, but he had a real interest in legal work and proved to be an excellent judge. He was acting chief justice during the absence of Justice Way in England in 1891‚Äì2, and several times acted as deputy governor between 1885 and 1897. Boucaut remained very attached to his roots in Cornwall, being active in the Adelaide Cornish Association, and he considered Cornwall to be a nation.John Langdon Bonython, Address of the President, Journal of the Royal Institution of Cornwall, Volume XXIV, Parts 1 and 2, 1933-34, p4. His brother Bastin Boucaut (c. 1843 ‚Äì 16 September 1864) was a member of B. T. Finniss's 1864 surveying party to the Northern Territory; he died of fever at Escape Cliffs, aged 21. Late life and legacy Boucaut resigned in February 1905 on a pension of ¬£1,300 a year, on account of failing health. He had an estate at the foot of Mount Barker, where he bred purebred Arabian horses. His health improved with leisure and he lived until passing away at his home in Glenelg on 1 February 1916, aged 84. Boucaut married Janet, daughter of Alexander McCulloch, in 1864 who predeceased him. He was survived by five sons and a daughter. He became a Q.C. in 1875 and was created K.C.M.G. in 1898. He published in London in 1905, his vigorously written The Arab, the Horse of the Future, and in the following year, Letters to My Boys, An Australian Judge and Ex-Premier on his Travels in Europe. Boucaut's Speeches on Railways and Public Works was published as a pamphlet in 1875.

In 1881, all three brothers operated the railway contracting firm and partnered with, or work for, the Corey Brothers in their first construction job, building the Oregon Short Line Railroad lines in Idaho. They then went to Canada to work on the Canadian Pacific Railway, where their horses died of disease and they struggled to work through heavy snows. Wattis Brothers then joined with the Corey Brothers in the Corey Brothers & Company organization to meet the obligations for completing the railway line. Wattis Brothers prospered until the Panic of 1893, a depression that affected the entire country. The company went broke after their bank failed. Wattis Brothers founded the Utah Construction Company in 1900, and Thomas Dee and David Eccles later became significant investors in the railroad construction organization.

Throughout history, the genre has suffered ups and downs having a significant peak in the 1990s. Here's a breakdown of how rock evolved in the island through the decades. 1950s and 1960s The 1950s mark the introduction of the Rock and Roll genre on the island. With the Elvis Presley hype in the United States, some of its influence reached the island of Puerto Rico. While a few young rock groups were in existence, television producer Alfred D. Herger started bringing rock and roll acts into the island motivating the local audience to embrace it. This input, and Herger's tutelage, ignited some young artists to start the movement \\"La Nueva Ola\\" (The New Wave). Herger also led several television night shows where he showcased rock music from the island and the USA. Late 1960s and 1970s In the mid to late 1960s, several Puerto Rican bands started surfacing with some mainstream success, such as The Night Walkers. While most of them centered their appearances at private activities at local entertainment centers and night clubs, some appeared on TV. In the early 1970s, the movement of nova trova musicians was growing in the island, led by singers like Roy Brown and Noel Hern√°ndez. During this time, the local radio station Alfa Rock starts broadcasting rock music in the island. The 1980s With the arrival of stations like MTV, American rock reached the island. However, surging rock en espa√±ol bands from Mexico, Argentina and Spain were still rarely heard of, and most of the local bands still sang in English. Artists of other genres like Menudo, started fusing their music (pop/ballads) with rock. This decade also started the ongoing \\"battle\\" between \\"Cocolos\\" (people that listen to salsa) and \\"rockeros\\" (people that listen to Rock music). The introduction of new wave and Europop in the USA started the surging of similar bands like Words Four Two, No You Turn, NeoEngland, and Nirvana (not the Kurt Cobain band). In 1988, a pop-rock band called Top Banana was signed by national label CBS. The 1990s During this decade, rock music reached its peak in the island. Rock en Espa√±ol fully reached the island, and artists like Miguel Mateos, and others were heard in radio stations. Mattador released the first instance of their album Save Us From Ourselves with guitarist Ram√≥n Ortiz, who would later go on to play with Puya (previously known as Whisker Biscuit). The band even opened the Iron Maiden concert at the island. On January 4, 1990, John Rodriguez aka. MetalKid, a radio personality launched the first radio program to cater only Puerto Rican artists at La Mega Station 106 FM along with Edgardo \\"El Bebo\\" Adames; giving the opportunity to dozens of acts play their music on the radio. Later that year MetalKid created Brutal Noise Music, the first record label to include metal music on their roster. Bands like Crypta, Homicide, Morbid Death, Deathkross and the Christian act Deathless among others were the first metal releases to be available under Brutal Noise. Brutal Noise joined forces with local promoter Albert Morales from ShowNet and produced concerts like Iron Maiden, Pantera, Sepultura, Slayer making the way to promote local acts on their shows. Until today this tradition still alive. In 1994, former Menudo singer Robi Rosa released his first solo album, and Mattador re-released their album, is the most commercially successful rock band in Puerto Rico, selling over 250,000 copies from their last album Consejo and reaching platinum since their debut in Puerto Rican charts in 1998. The 1990s saw also the first video from a local band in MTV Latino. It was for the song \\"Terminal\\" by La Mosca, aka Spanish Fly and Spanish Flies. The band was a power trio composed of Geronimo Mercado, Eduardo Paniagua & Gaby Vidal. Eduardo would later go to Puya & Gaby Vidal to ONGO. Steve Vai used the band as his backing band when he came to Puerto Rico for a guitar clinic at Villa Piano. When Draco came to the island for his three show at The Warehouse, La Mosca was chosen to open them all. 2000s This decade saw growth on the island in regards to the rock genre as a whole, with new bands and existing bands experimenting with such genres such as rock, heavy metal genre, punk and soft rock.

Strangways was the eldest son of Henry Bull Strangways of Shapwick, Somerset, England. As a boy, he visited South Australia, where his uncle Thomas Bewes Strangways was a pioneer. Returning to England he entered the Middle Temple in November 1851 and was called to the bar in June 1856. He went to Adelaide early in the following year, was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly for Encounter Bay in January 1858, and became Attorney-General of South Australia in the First Reynolds Ministry from May 1860 to May 1861. The ministry was then reconstructed and Strangways became Commissioner of Crown Lands and Immigration until October 1861. He held the same position in the Waterhouse ministry from October 1861 to July 1863, in the Dutton ministry from March to September 1865, and in the third Ayers ministry from September to October 1865.

In February 1871 he travelled to England on private business; while there he resigned his seat in the South Australian Parliament and settled instead at Shapwick Manor on the Strangways family's estate in Somerset, where he lived the life of a country gentleman until his death on 10 February 1920. He retained an interest in South Australia all his life, but does not appear to have revisited it. In January 1861 he married Maria Cordelia Wigley, a sister of William Rodolph Wigley (c. 1826‚Äì1890), and was survived by a daughter.

He was Keeper of the Royal Academy in London. Life Ruth, Boas and Naomi Broken Vows (1856; Tate Britain, London). The Vine Calderon was born in Poitiers, France. His father, the Reverend Juan Calder√≥n (* in Villafranca de los Caballeros; ‚Ä† in London) was a professor of Spanish literature and a former Roman Catholic priest who had converted to Anglicanism. Calderon planned to study engineering, but he became so interested in drawing technical figures and diagrams that he changed his mind and devoted his time to art. In 1850, he trained at Leigh's art school, London, then went to Paris to study under Fran√ßois-√âdouard Picot in 1851. His first successful painting was called By the waters of Babylon (1852), which was followed by a much more popular one called Broken Vows (1856). From the beginning he was inspired by the Pre- Raphaelites, and some of his work showed the detail, deep colors, and realistic forms that characterize the style. The artist Henry Stacy Marks was his friend and brother-in-law, and Calderon exhibited his portrait at the Royal Academy in 1872.W. W. Fenn, 'Our Living Artists: Philip Hermogenes Calderon RA', Magazine of Art, December 1878, pp. 197-202\\\\. Calderon became a leading member of the St John's Wood Clique, a group of artists interested in modern genre and historical subjects who were inspired, both artistically and socially by the Pre-Raphaelites. Historical, biblical, and literary themes were common in Calderon's later work. Many of his pieces show women wearing rich, silky clothing in gently colored landscapes. His Morning (1884) features a copper-haired maiden watching a sunrise. His Juliet (1888) shows Shakespeare's Juliet seated on her balcony gazing at the stars. His later paintings adopt a more classical style, comparable to Edward Poynter, which resulted from his close relationship with Frederic Leighton, then-President of the Royal Academy. Calderon became Keeper of the Royal Academy in 1887, and from then on worked to support the teaching of anatomy based on nude models at the Royal Academy Schools. His 1891 painting St Elizabeth of Hungary's great act of renunciation was secured by the Chantrey bequest for the national collection, and is now located in Tate Britain, but caused considerable controversy because of its perceived anti-Catholic message. It depicted the saint bending nude over an altar watched by monks.

The bridges link the St George area at Blakehurst to the Sutherland Shire at Sylvania. Tom Uglys Bridge is one of six major road crossings of Georges River. The 1929 Pratt truss bridge is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register and carries three lanes of northbound vehicular traffic on the Princes Highway (A36). The 1987 concrete box girder bridge was built to the east of the older bridge and carries the three southbound lanes of the highway. Both bridges have shared bicycle and pedestrian pathways.  Tom Uglys Point ferries  punts running across the Georges River in 1929. Tenders were called to construct a punt for Tom Ugly's Point in 1864. A hand-operated punt service from Tom Uglys Point to Horse Rock Point commenced. The ferry service was improved and expanded over the years. In 1882 a steam-driven ferry, guided by steel cables, was installed. It crossed the river in less than ten minutes. The punt was long, had a wide roadway. and was capable of carrying six horse-drawn vehicles. By 1898 a larger steam-driven ferry began operation. It was capable of carrying one hundred passengers and fifteen vehicles. A new punt capable of carrying 28 vehicles and making the crossing in three minutes was installed in 1922. By 1929 there were two cable ferries operating, and delays of several hours were experienced on weekends and public holidays.  Description  =1929 bridge= Following a long campaign by local councils and motoring authorities, a New South Wales Government loan to Sutherland Shire Council was used to finance the replacement of one the punt services across the Georges River. The Bill for the building of a bridge across the Georges River was introduced into New South Wales Parliament in 1923, and the foundation stone for the bridge was laid on 7 June 1924. The funds borrowed by Sutherland Shire Council were to be repaid by a bridge toll once it was opened. As use of the punt was free the bridge toll was controversial. The crossing was first opened for traffic on 26 April 1929, and officially opened by the Governor of New South Wales on 11 May 1929. It was known as the \\"George's River Bridge\\". The 1929 bridge consists of nine steel truss spans forming a total length of ; six spans were and three spans were . The bridge was designed by Percy Allan who designed many bridges in New South Wales including the Pyrmont Bridge. When the bridge was opened it was the longest bridge in Australia. The toll was collected on the Sylvania side of the bridge by toll collectors who stood on the road. On 31 May 1952 the tolls were removed when the Council had repaid the loan to the NSW Government. In the late 1940s the lanes on the bridge were reconfigured to provide a third lane, and this allow the introduction of a tidal flow system (northbound in the morning and southbound in the evening), which continued until the second bridge was opened. Notwithstanding the creation of the third lane, by the mid 1960s congestion had grown to a significant level, especially on summer weekend afternoons. However it was not for another twenty years that funding was allocated by the New South Wales government for the design and construction of a duplicate bridge. In 2006, the 1929 steel truss bridge was repainted. The original lead paint was removed using a blasting process and an air extraction system was employed to safely remove airborne particles, protecting the environment as well as the workers. = The 1987 bridge = The second bridge, which opened on 17 October 1987, also comprises nine spans (in order to place the piers in line with those of the first bridge) of three identical steel box girders, composite with a cast- in-place reinforced concrete deck; the major spans are in length with end spans of . The new bridge was designed to carry four lanes of traffic. During repair work on the 1929 bridge, when it was temporarily closed to traffic, the 1987 bridge was configured both for one lane northbound and three lanes southbound. =Features of both bridges= Most duplicate bridges are close together (like the dual bridges at Ryde) and parallel, allowing the form of the road approaches to continue. However, at Tom Uglys Point, the two bridges are not parallel. They are less than apart at the northern end, but about apart at the southern end. This avoids replication of the pair of tight curves on the southern approach to the 1929 bridge on the southern exit from the second bridge. On the southern side, between the two bridges, is a boat ramp, accessible from the northbound bridge approach. On the northern side a loop road allows drivers travelling south along the Princes Highway (A1) to avoid the bridge and return northwards along the highway. Etymology Tom Uglys Bridge took its name from the geographical feature at the northern end of the bridge, known as Tom Uglys Point. The point was known as Tom Uglys Point over 80 years prior to the construction of the bridge. At various times the bridge is incorrectly transcribed as Tom Ugly's Bridge. There are several theories about the origin of the name of the point. * One is that it was named after a local resident Tom Huxley and the name was a mispronunciation by local Aboriginal people. Descendants of Thomas Huxley have concluded that he lived and owned land in the area but official records do not exist to verify this. * Another theory is that it was derived from the name of a local Aboriginal man, Tow-weiry, who lived in the area and died about 1846. * Another theory is that there was a local fisherman resident in the area by the name of Tom Illigley. * Yet another is that there was a one-legged man, possibly an army deserter or a boat operator, called either \\"Tom Woggleg\\" or \\"Wogul Leg Tom\\", either because of a mispronunciation of wooden leg, or from the local Aboriginal dialect word for \\"one\\". The name was officially adopted to distinguish between the various subsequent bridges across Georges River, after the opening of the Captain Cook Bridge in 1965 and the Alfords Point Bridge in 1973.

Wirt developed the Gary Plan for the more efficient use of school facilities, a reform of the Progressive Movement that was widely adopted in other cities. As superintendent of education In 1907, Wirt became superintendent of schools in Gary and began implementing his educational values in the local schools. He initiated teacher hiring standards, designed school buildings, lengthened the school day, and organized the schools according to his ideals. The core of the schools' organization in Gary centered upon the platoon or work-study-play system and Americanizing the 63.4 percent of children with parents who were immigrants.Weiner, 2010, p. 35. Above the primary grades, students were divided into two platoons‚Äîone platoon used the academic classrooms (which were deemphasized), while the second platoon was divided between the shops, nature studies, auditorium, gymnasium, and outdoor facilities split between girls and boys. \\"Girls learned cooking, sewing, and bookkeeping while the boys learning metalwork, cabinetry, woodworking, painting, printing, shoemaking, and plumbing.\\" In the Gary plan, all of the school equipment remained in use during the entire school day; Rather than opening up new schools for the overwhelming population of students, it was hoped that the \\"Gary Plan would save the city money by utilizing all rooms in existing schools by rotating children through classrooms, auditoriums, playgrounds, and gymnasiums.\\" The platoon system gained acceptance in Gary and received national attention during the early decades of the twentieth century. In 1914, the New York City hired Wirt as a part-time consultant to introduce the work-study-play system in the public schools. In the following three years, however, the Gary system encountered resistance from students, parents, and labor leaders concerned that the plan simply trained children to work in factories and the fact that Gary's Plan was in predominantly Jewish areas. \\"In January 1916, the Board of Education released a report finding students attending Gary Plan schools performed worse than those in 'non-Garyuzed schools' .\\"Weiner, 2010, p. 42. Attack against the New Deal programs In addition to these concerns, William Wirt launched an attack upon Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal programs, charging that the New Deal threatened American individualism by attempting government planning of the economy. He wrote pamphlets, articles, and addresses on the economy, particularly regarding the manipulation of the dollar to solve the economic crisis. Finally, Wirt accused the New Deal of being infiltrated by communists designing the collapse of the American system. His ideas appeared in his pamphlet America Must Lose by a ‚ÄúPlanned Economy,‚Äù the Stepping-Stone to a Regimented State (1934). The pamphlet made him the target of a libel suit.

It is one of eight major arts institutions in Monterey County, as designated by the Community Foundation of Monterey County,The Community Foundation for Monterey County . Cfmco.org, accessed April 29, 2011 and is supported in part by grants from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, The Shubert Foundation, the Berkshire Foundation and the Monterey Peninsula Foundation.  History  The company was founded in 1982 as GroveMont Theatre by Carmel-by-the-Sea resident Stephen Moorer, who served as its artistic director from 1983 to 2008, and its Executive Director since 2009. The organizational name changed to Pacific Repertory Theatre in 1994 when the company acquired the historic site of the Golden Bough Playhouse in downtown Carmel, and announced intentions to establish a professional theatre for the region. In 2001, in order to facilitate an appearance by Olympia Dukakis and Louis Zorich in Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard, the company entered into a seasonal agreement with Actors' Equity Association, and as a result, it became the only professional theatre in Monterey County. The company gained national attention, beginning in 2001, for its series of Shakespeare plays entitled Royal Blood: The Rise and Fall of Kings. Over the course of several summers, it presented the series, consisting of all of Shakespeare's histories, in order. PacRep presents a year-round season of 10‚Äì12 plays and musicals in three historic Carmel theatres: The 300-seat Golden Bough Playhouse, the 120-seat Circle Theatre and the 540-seat outdoor Forest Theater. The company presents over 175 performances each year.  Forest Theater  In 1984, Pacific Repertory Theatre joined the Forest Theater community. At the request of the Carmel Cultural Commission, the company began producing shows at the historic outdoor facility, staging Robinson Jeffers‚Äô Medea, starring local actress Rosamond Goodrich Zanides. In 1990, the company reactivated the old Carmel Shake-speare Festival of the 1940s, playing in repertory at the Forest, Golden Bough, and Circle theatres, and adding the hyphen in \\"Shake-speare\\" to denote interest and support research into the growing Shakespeare Authorship Question.Clarkson, Philip B. \\"Carmel Shakes-Peare Festival\\", Shakespeare companies and festivals, pp. 28‚Äì31 (Eds. Ron Engle, Felicia Hardison Londr√© and Daniel J. Watermeier). Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995 Since that time, the company has continued to stage productions at the Forest Theater every September and October, expanding into August in 2000, when it became the only professional theater company in residence at the Forest Theater. In 2011, following the closure of the 50-year-old Children's Experimental Theater, the City of Carmel awarded the year-round lease of the indoor Forest Theater to PacRep for its educational SoDA program.  Leadership change  In 2008, the PacRep Board of Directors named Kenneth Kelleher as Artistic Director, and founder Stephen Moorer was named Executive Director after serving as Artistic Director since 1982. Kelleher has been a theatre director in the San Francisco Bay area for many years, including at the San Francisco Shakespeare Festival and Shakespeare at Stinson. The 2009 season marked the first full season under Kelleher's artistic leadership. The season included a 14-member adaptation of Man of La Mancha, and the controversial David Hare play, The Blue Room, a frank look at sexual encounters based on La Ronde. Both productions were directed by Kelleher, who also assumed directorial duties for the season productions of Hamlet and As You Like It.  Outreach  Annual outreach programs include PacRep's School of Dramatic Arts (SoDA) and the Tix4Kids program that distributes subsidized theatre tickets to underserved youth. In addition, the company regularly participates in numerous community activities including regional parade, festivals and holiday events.

He was also the first surgeon to perform a coronary artery bypass, during 1972 in Mississippi, United States, and Monterrey, Mexico. Chavez was born in Cajamarca, Peru. He was the last of nine children born to Nazario Ch√°vez Aliaga (1891‚Äì1979). He graduated from the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Lima, Peru in the late 1950s and moved to the United States where he finished his training in Cardiothoracic surgery at the University of Mississippi Medical Center and completed his residency in 1961. As a young doctor in 1962, Chavez went to the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson for post-graduate training in cardiovascular medicine. \\"The thrust of research at that time was going toward transplantation,\\" he said.Stoner, J. (1995). Chavez on team of first-ever heart transplant. The Brownsville Herald, 80, 6. Heart Transplant Transplant research began at the University of Mississippi Medical Center‚Äôs labs in 1956, investigating operative techniques, organ storage and preservation, post-operative management and other problems. Chavez visited leading medical centers around the country to learn from their trials and errors, and determine which animals could potentially be the best donors. A donated human heart would have been almost unthinkable at that time. By the spring of 1963, the doctors began cautiously planning for a heart transplant. On January 22, 1964 a 68-year-old man was admitted to the hospital in a coma with no detectable blood pressure... thus his life expectancy was measured in hours.Chavez C, Hardy J. (1968). The first heart transplant in man. Developmental animal investigations with analysis of the 1964 case in the light of current clinical experience. American Journal of Cardiology, Dec;22(6):772-81. A potential donor was a man with severe brain injury, his breathing supported by a ventilator.Chavez C, Hardy J. (1969). The first heart transplant in man: historical reexamination of the 1964 case in the light of current clinical experience. Transplant Procedures, Jun;1(2):717-25. Doctors were reluctant, however, to remove from life support because his blood pressure was stable, so an alternate donor was found; a chimpanzee. Chavez said his prior research showed chimps‚Äô and baboons‚Äô blood types most closely matched humans‚Äô. The procedure took place on January 23, and for a short time, the transplanted heart beat normally But by one hour after the cardiopulmonary bypass machine was removed, two hours following the removal of the clamps; effective blood pressure could no longer be maintained. \\"The body went into acute rejection of the heart,\\" Chavez said. Only a few anti-rejection medicines were available to doctors at that time. The doctors surmised the heart may have been too small and that the patient too weak before surgery for the transplant to take place.Petrovskii B. (1968). [The problem of heart transplantation](Article in Russian). Kardiologiia, Jun;8(6):3-6 But Chavez and his mentor, James D. Hardy, M.D., had proven heart transplantation in humans could be done. Their effort was overshadowed in history by the more noteworthy first human-to-human heart transplant by Christiaan Barnard, M.D. in Cape Town, South Africa, in 1967. The American Medical Association, and its convention in New York City, presented Chavez with a Scientific Award silver medal for his exhibit on transplantation in 1965. He also received an Honor Achievement Award from the Angiology Research foundation in 1968. Chavez forsook private practicing for a while, and devoted his energies to teaching. He had served as chief instructor of anatomy and professor of surgery in his native Lima, Peru. Private life After about 15 years of teaching in Jackson, he began to yearn for private practice. ‚ÄúThe only opportunity left for me (at the University of Mississippi) was department chairman, held by Dr. Hardy. It didn‚Äôt seem as though he would be stepping down any time soon.‚Äù At about the same time, a friend who was practicing in Lubbock, Texas, began calling Chavez to recruit him. The surgeon moved his family to Lubbock in 1978, worked at his practice, and also joined the faculty at Texas Tech University. In 1982, Chavez moved again, this time to Brownsville, Texas and remains active in medicine, although has not performed any transplant work in recent years.

Both are immersed tubes, constructed by sinking precast concrete segments to a trench in the Estuary floor, then sealing them together to create a tunnel. The Posey tube, completed in 1928, currently carries one- way (Oakland-bound) traffic under the Estuary, while the Webster tube, completed in 1963, currently carries traffic from Oakland to Alameda. The Posey tube is the second-oldest underwater vehicular tunnel in the US, preceded only by the Holland Tunnel. It is the oldest immersed tube vehicular tunnel in the world. History The Oakland Estuary (then known as San Antonio Creek) was first crossed by the Webster Street swing bridge for narrow gauge rail and road traffic, completed in 1871. a second crossing was added in 1873 as the Alice Street swing bridge, built for Central Pacific (later Southern Pacific) rail traffic. Both the Webster and Alice bridges were replaced by new swing bridges completed in 1900 and 1898, respectively. The Alice bridge was replaced by the Harrison Street bridge, one block west. The replacements were prompted by the Secretary of War, who stated the swing spans each needed to be at least to accommodate marine traffic in 1896. At first, it was planned to replace both bridges with a single bridge, but Southern Pacific officials were unable to come to an agreement with Alameda County supervisors, and in 1897 the railroad declared the Harrison Street bridge, replacing the Alice bridge, would be devoted solely to rail traffic, accommodating both narrow and standard-gauge trains. During the construction of the replacement Webster bridge, county supervisors initially rejected an offer to use the old Alice bridge as a detour for road traffic, but later accepted, avoiding a more distant route through the eastern part of Alameda, and teamster traffic moved to Alice in December. The old Webster bridge was demolished by January 1899. By 1916, the War Department had declared the replacement Webster and Harrison bridges were a menace to deep-water navigation and an obstacle to continued development of Oakland Harbor in 1916. As an example, rammed the Webster Street bridge in January 1926, causing the swing section to fall into the Estuary and forcing road traffic to be rerouted. After the completion of the Posey tube, the Webster Street bridge was sold to Sacramento County for in November 1928. =Posey Tube= Posey tube entrance in Alameda Preliminary plans for a tube had been explored as early as 1903, but detailed studies were not prepared until 1922. However, the entry of the United States into World War I delayed the plans for a new connection between Oakland and Alameda. A permit for the tube under the Oakland Estuary was granted in April 1923 and Alameda County voters approved a $5 million bond measure in May to build the tube. After the passage of the bond issue, test borings were taken in the Estuary, and bids were received for the work on March 23, 1925; the construction contract was awarded to the California Bridge and Tunnel Company (CB&TC;) with a low bid of , and excavation started from the Oakland end on June 15, 1925. The contract was let by Alameda County without state involvement. The Posey tube, completed and opened to traffic on October 27, 1928, was named after George Posey (Cal '06), who was the Alameda County Surveyor during the tunnel's planning and construction, and also chief engineer on the construction project. It is the first tunnel for road traffic built using the immersed tube technique. However, the two-lane tube was considered inadequate shortly after completion; in a 1952 letter from Frank Osborne, mayor of Alameda, to Lloyd Harmon, mayor of Coronado, which was considering a similar tunnel to San Diego, Osborne stated \\"from the time it was completed the tube was never adequate for the purpose for which it was built ... I am firmly of the belief that the building of any underwater tube of less than four lanes‚Äîtwo in each direction‚Äîwould be a serious mistake on the part of any engineers who contemplate it.\\" In 1952, the Posey Tube was handling 30 to 36,000 cars per day. =Design= The ventilation buildings that house the exhaust and fresh air fans are built in an art deco style; local architect Henry H. Meyers is credited with the design of both portals. The ventilation of toxic vehicular exhaust fume design was modeled on that of the Holland Tunnel's ventilation system, and Ole Singstad (who had designed the pioneering ventilation system of the Holland Tunnel) consulted. A pair of canaries were used during construction as living air monitors; although one canary died during construction, it was an accident caused by being penned up with a pet cat and not a toxic atmosphere. Up to that time, tunnels had been vented longitudinally, with fresh air blown in one end and out the other; the Holland (and Posey) Tube instead used fans to supply air into the tunnel through a space beneath the roadway, and exhausted air through a similar space above the traffic portion. Ducts were set in the curb and ceiling approximately every along the length of the Posey Tube, providing a system of \\"transverse\\" ventilation from bottom-to-top, rather than end-to-end, ensuring that any fires would not spread through the length of the tunnel. Typical section of Webster Street tube; Posey Tube sections are similar. It was the first precast concrete tube to be constructed, assembled from 12 large segments. The concrete tube was protected from leaks through insulation and coverings applied to the outer surface. Each segment was cast at Hunters Point by CB&TC.; After they were completed, the segments were sealed and the space beneath the roadway was filled with water as ballast while floating each segment into position; when ready, wet sand was added to the roadway to sink the segment into a dredged underwater trench. Once the joint to the prior segment had been sealed, the water ballast was pumped out and the process was repeated for the next segment. Including the approaches at each end, the Posey Tube is long; the tunnel portion itself is long. Each segment is long and in diameter, and weighs approximately . The walls of the tube are thick. From Oakland, the approach extends from Sixth to Third along Harrison. The maximum grade within the Posey Tube is 4.59%. =Webster Street Tube= Webster Street tube entrance in Oakland The Webster Street Tube was constructed west of and parallel to the Posey Tube to accommodate increased traffic between Oakland and Alameda and to address the deficiencies of the original design, a single tube with only two lanes. In 1941, \\"final negotiations\\" were being made for a second tube, and plans for a second tube at Webster Street had been advanced in 1948 as part of a Parallel Bridge scheme. The Parallel Bridge was one of the \\"Southern Crossing\\" designs which would have added another trans-Bay bridge south of the 1936 San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge. Alternate URL Construction began on October 12, 1959. Alternate URL To prepare the Alameda site, a large Navy hangar was moved; at the time, it set a record for the largest building ever moved. The Webster Street tube was completed and opened to one-way (into Alameda) traffic in 1963. Alternate URL Upon completion of the Webster tube, the Posey Tube was closed temporarily and renovations were performed to convert it to one-way (into Oakland) traffic; during renovations, the Webster Street tube handled bidirectional traffic. Like the preceding Posey Tube, the Webster Street tube was constructed using immersed precast concrete segments; this time the twelve Webster segments were constructed in a graving dock built on Alameda. Divers were used to ensure each segment landed in the surveyed location. Piles were driven to support each segment, but the piles were designed to collapse after an additional of ballast were added, to ensure the segments rested firmly on an bed of packed sand. Construction of the Webster tube started from the Alameda end and progressed towards Oakland, with the precast segments set before additional cast-in-place segments were added at each end. Each of the Webster segments were of comparable size and configuration to the earlier Posey tube segments, measuring long and in diameter, with walls thick. However, the Webster segments were equipped with rectangular collars (W√óH) at each end, and weighed more, approximately each.

Lillian Vernon (center) donates a refrigerated truck to Citymeals- on-Wheels History Lillian Vernon was started by Lillian Menasche at the age of twenty-four, by placing advertisements in Seventeen magazine for personalized purses and belts. As a result of this success, the Vernon Specialties Company became focused on products for young women by advertising in magazines focused on that emergent market. The Lillian Vernon Catalog, which the company launched in 1956,Cherry, Robin. Catalog: The Illustrated History of Mail-Order Shopping. New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 2008. became an iconic shopping resource for American women, much like its competitor, the Sears catalog. Produced monthly, the catalog was typically 120 pages and usually featured 750 items. In response to a catalog and shopping mall boom in the United States in the 1980s, the company produced a number of specialty catalogs in order to broaden its market, including ones targeted for children and homemakers. The Lillian Vernon Corporation, founded in 1965, went public in 1987, and was the first company to be founded by a woman to be publicly traded on the American Stock Exchange. Responding to the increasingly important online market in the early 1990s, the Lillian Vernon Corporation opened a storefront on AOL in 1995 and followed with an online catalog and website. However, by the end of the 1990s, the company began to struggle to meet online needs, especially after the collapse of the Dot-com bubble. After Fred and David Hochberg both declined to take over running their mother's company, Vernon sold it to ZelnickMedia in 2003, but retained the symbolic title of non-executive chairman. The company has since changed hands a number of times including emerging from a bankruptcy process in 2008. In October 2015 Lillian Vernon was purchased by Regent, a Beverly Hills-based private equity firm controlled by investor Michael Reinstein.

Location The Huffman community is centered on Farm to Market Roads 2100 and 1960, northeast of Downtown Houston in the piney woods of southeastern Texas. David Huffman, a native of Louisiana, came to Texas to fight against Mexico during the Texas Revolution. For services rendered, Huffman received $24 and of land in 1838. Along with his father Abe, Huffman and a group from Louisiana settled in the area north of FM 1960 and east of FM 2100 in 1840. In the early years, the economy was driven by farming with primary crops being cotton, rice and corn as well as ranching and logging. A post office was established at the community in 1888, and two blacksmith shops were operating here by 1892. The Beaumont, Sour Lake and Western Railway came through the community in the early 1900s. By 1914 the town reported two general stores and a population of 250. The construction and operation of the Sinclair Oil pump station in 1921 added to the economy. The 1936 county highway map showed a church and cemetery at the townsite. In 1953, Lake Houston was opened as a recreational lake and still serves the area today with boating, water skiing and jetting, fishing and sailing. Huffman covers about and houses approximately 12,000 citizens. Huffman is a community consisting largely of subdivisions, scattered farms, apartments, and small businesses. Huffman has two community newspapers: The Tribune Newspaperhttp://www.ourtribune.com and The Lake Houston Observer.  Education  =Primary and secondary public schools= The Huffman Independent School District is named after the community and, up to 2007, served the area with four schools: Ben Bowen Elementary, Copeland Intermediate,Falcon Ridge Elementary, Huffman Middle School, and Hargrave High School.

Red areas indicate generally accepted areas of Superior, while pink areas are present in some definitions. The proposed State of Superior (or State of Ontonagon) is the name of a \\"51st state\\" proposal involving the secession of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and possibly other portions of northern Michigan, and in some proposals, some of the northern counties from the state of Wisconsin as well. The proposal is spurred by cultural differences, geographic separation, and the belief that the capitals in Lansing, and Madison, ignore the problems of the \\"Superior Region.\\" The same area had been referred to as a possible future state named Sylvania by Thomas Jefferson. Named for Lake Superior, the idea has gained serious attention at times, though is unlikely to ever come to fruition because of the large amount of funding that the area receives from the lower parts of the state, and because of the completion of the Mackinac Bridge in 1957, which gave the Upper Peninsula a direct highway connection to the rest of the state. Several prominent legislators, including local Upper Peninsula politician Dominic Jacobetti, attempted enacting such legislation in the 1970s, with no success. If the Upper Peninsula of Michigan were turned into a state, it would currently have a smaller population than any other state, with its 311,361 residents representing only 60 percent of Wyoming's population and less than 50 percent of Alaska's. It would rank 40th in land area, larger than Maryland. Its most-populous city, Marquette, has a smaller population than Burlington, Vermont, which has the smallest population of the 50 cities that are the most populous in their respective states. History Efforts to secede and form a new state date back to 1858, when a convention was held in Ontonagon, Michigan, for the purpose of forming a new state combining the Upper Peninsula, northern Wisconsin, and northeast Minnesota. The new state was to be called either Superior or Ontonagon. The New York Times editorialized: > Unless Congress should interpose objections, which cannot reasonably be > apprehended, we see no cause why the new \\"State of Ontonagon\\" should not > speedily take her place as an independent member of the union. In 1897, another proposal for creating a State of Superior included areas in the Upper Peninsula along with portions of Wisconsin. In 1962, an Upper Peninsula Independence Association was founded to advocate for the formation of a State of Superior. A secession bill was submitted to the Michigan Legislature, and 20,000 petition signatures were collected‚Äî36,000 short of the number needed‚Äîfor a ballot referendum on separation. Efforts continued into the mid-1970s (one bumper sticker suggested naming the 51st state \\"North Michigan\\"), with residents of the Upper Peninsula and northern Wisconsin, each resentful of perceived tax drains and other slights from their downstate cousins, joining together to pursue the desired legislation. Some support for statehood still exists in the region, although no organized movement is currently active.

Early years A member of a prominent Hempstead family, Onderdonk graduated from Columbia College, now Columbia University, where he was president of the Philolexian Society. He studied theology under Bishop John Henry Hobart and was a member of the Episcopal Theological Society between 1810 and 1811.LM He married Elizabeth Handy Moscrop, daughter of Rev. Henry Moscrop and Elizabeth Handy. He presided over the Diocese during a period of expansion and was instrumental in the creation of numerous parishes, but is best remembered as one of the most controversial figures in the history of the Episcopal Church of the United States. Consecrators * William White, Bishop of Pennsylvania, Presiding Bishop of the ECUSA * Thomas Church Brownell, Bishop of Connecticut * Henry U. Onderdonk, Bishop of Pennsylvania, older brother of Benjamin Tredwell Onderdonk The Carey Affair A strong supporter of the Oxford Movement, Onderdonk became embroiled in a controversy surrounding the ordination of Arthur Carey. Carey, a candidate for the ministry acknowledged even by his detractors as being of superb intellect and dedication, and also of an excellent Christian character, was like Onderdonk greatly influenced by the Oxford Movement. As his ordination approached, Carey was examined by the Rev. Dr. Hugh Smith, Rector of St. Peter's, New York (where he had been assigned). During this interview, Carey professed views that were sympathetic to Roman Catholicism, and thereafter Smith and some other clergy and laymen opposed Carey's ordination. At Smith's insistence, Onderdonk conducted an inquiry, which ultimately found Carey to be suitable for ordination, which was celebrated in 1843. The dispute did not end there, and a number of letters were published accusing Carey and ultimately Onderdonk of being overly sympathetic to Roman Catholicism. This controversy spread beyond the Diocese, and at least one other Diocese, that of Ohio, adopted a resolution condemning Onderdonk.http://www1.kenyon.edu/publications/bulletin/21_4/?article=douglass Allegations of misconduct As the Carey controversy was ongoing, William Meade, Bishop of Virginia (later the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America) received a number of affidavits of women who alleged that Onderdonk had made improper advances towards them and had engaged in improper touching. This eventually resulted in a trial before the House of Bishops. Throughout, Onderdonk maintained his innocence. By all accounts the trial was a bitter affair, with Onderdonk making accusations of a secret conspiracy to remove him due to his theological views by falsifying charges and Meade accusing the Onderdonk faction of witness intimidation. The trial resulted in the suspension of Onderdonk. Whether the trial was an appropriate act to punish a Bishop for improper behavior or a conspiracy to silence a proponent of the Oxford Movement may be ultimately unknowable. The debate continued in published letters throughout Onderdonk's life and indeed continues today.Evensong for the Anglican Communion What is clear though, as William Manross notes in A History of the American Episcopal Church (1935), was that the verdict against Onderdonk reflects \\"the bitter party feeling which prevailed at the time, especially as the voting throughout the trial was pretty much along party lines, all of the evangelicals voting to condemn Bishop Onderdonk and most, though not all, of the High Churchmen voting to acquit him.\\" Following his suspension, Onderdonk remained Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York but was suspended from performing his duties. Provisional Bishops were consecrated to fill his duties. They were Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright I, consecrated to serve as Provisional Bishop in place of Bishop Onderdonk, 1852‚Äì1854 and Horatio Potter consecrated in 1854 to serve as Provisional Bishop in place of Onderdonk; became diocesan in 1861. His brother, Henry Ustick Onderdonk, Bishop of Pennsylvania, was also suspended upon allegations of intemperance during the same time period. Death Benjamin Treadwell Onderdonk died at age 69 in 1861. His sarcophagus, now ensconced at Trinity Church in New York City, depicts him lying in repose yet crushing a serpent labeled \\"Scandal\\" beneath his heel.

Pellerin was born at Marly, near Versailles 27 April 1684 and died 2 August 1783 at his ch√¢teau of Plainville in Picardy. Youth and career Pellerin at 98 years of age Pellerin surrounded by some of his coins In his youth his principal studies were in the modern and classical languages, which included French, English, Spanish, Italian, Arabic, Latin, Greek, Hebrew and Syriac as well as others, and it was to his precocious expertise in these that he owed his admission to the offices of the Ministry of the Marine (as the Navy was called in France) in 1706, where he became employed in correspondence. Having in 1709 succeeded (despite the previous failure of trained cryptographers) to decipher some coded letters seized from a Spanish frigate concerning the Archduke Charles of Austria (one of the pretenders to the Spanish throne, the other being Louis XIV's nephew the Duke of Anjou; this being the cause of the ongoing Wars of the Spanish Succession), by this astonishing feat he caught the attention of then Naval Minister Pontchartrain who named him cabinet secretary. He enjoyed similar favour in the succeeding ministries: under Louis XIV's legitimated son the Count of Toulouse he was named Commissioner of the Navy in 1718, and Maurepas elevated him to General Commissioner, and then First Commissioner. His detailed plans for the invasion of Britain to restore Bonnie Prince Charlie to the throne (and thus occupy British forces which were greatly hampering French colonial affairs), though supported by Maurepas went unexecuted by Louis XV (whether out of disregard, pique against Maurepas, personally, or for another reason remains in debate). They may be consulted in the Maurepas Papers at Cornell University. After a very successful career he sought an early retirement in 1745 citing health problems due to overwork. In fact he remained on as a greatly valued expert consultant for several years afterwards, his positions having gradually been formally assumed by his son Joseph Jr., who received letters-patent of nobility in recognition of two generations' of his family's service to the crown in 1740. Pioneer of numismatics Pellerin Sr. thus eventually became free to follow his true passion, which was the study of ancient (principally Greek) coins. Tradition has it that he encouraged the sailors of the French Mediterranean Fleet to buy up such ancient coins as they found on offer throughout their range, which he guaranteed to buy back from them at double the purchase price. In this way he gradually accumulated what became the largest and most valuable collection of ancient Greek coins ever to be held in private hands to that date, amounting to 33,500 coins which he ultimately sold to Louis XVI in 1776 for ¬£300,000 . This notable collection, housed in massive original marquetry and ormolu cases in the Louis Quinze style, still forms a nucleus of the collection of the Biblioth√®que Nationale de France and may be viewed in the old buildings on the Rue de Richelieu in Paris to this day. Pellerin's study brought great advances to the science of numismatics. Through the publication of his enormous ten- volume catalogue of ancient Greek coins (Paris: Chez H. L. Guerin & L. F. Delatour, 1762‚Äì1778, 10 vol. in-4¬∫. pl), which were in fact a catalogue raisonn√© of his own immense collection, he brought clarity to this muddied field by being the first to arrange the many thousands of issues geographically as well as chronologically. His identification of many puzzling pieces were a testimony to his rare powers of observation and perspicacity. He could be said to have cleared a path for the famous Eckhel. Such errors that slipped into his great work were later caught by Khell, Barth√©lemy (who was to negotiate the purchase of the collection for the King), Swinton and the Abb√© Leblond. He grew progressively more blind from the time of his retirement from public service and was almost completely blind at the time of his death, a near-centenarian in 1782. He found, however, a way to turn this handicap to profit, working on the succeeding volumes of his opus by day as easily as by night, writing his text on a thin ribbon of paper that he pulled off one spool only to be wound back up onto another to be later transcribed by his secretary. His sense of touch became phenomenally acute and he was able to identify minor variants of certain coins by subtle tactile differences alone. The portrait displayed on the upper right side of this page, from the frontispiece to one of the volumes of his work shows him surrounded by some of his favourite coins and antiquities in 1780, when he was already over 98 years of age. Family and legacy Pellerin married into another Versailles family in 1714 when he wed Marie-Anne, niece of Michel-Richard Delalande, court composer to Louis XIV and one of the great exponents of the French baroque motet, among his many other masterpieces. His daughter, also called Marie- Anne, married Arnaud I de La Porte (or De Laporte) in 1737 who later inherited the Pellerin offices after the premature death of Joseph Jr. The La Porte brothers were to prove very influential in the development of French colonial policy, particularly towards New France (Quebec), Arnaud's younger brother Jean-Baptiste de La Porte-Lalanne being named special envoy to Quebec to look into the civil administration and to check into some alleged financial irregularities there. He later went on to become Commissioner of the French Leeward Islands, and Saint Domingue (Haiti). Pellerin's grandson, Arnaud II de La Porte, after a brief stint as Minister of the Navy in 1789 became intendant of the Civil List in 1790. A close confidant of the beleaguered king, Louis XVI entrusted him with great sums of private money to be distributed toward the moderation of the rapidly radicalising revolutionary fervour. Despite a close collaboration with Mirabeau, and especially due to the latter's premature death, La Porte's efforts proved to be in vain, and he was arrested and convicted of treason against the Revolution becoming, on 23 August 1793 the second political victim of the guillotine. In a macabre gesture, his severed head was then presented to the King, imprisoned in the Temple, as a grisly birthday gift. His services and ultimate sacrifice were recalled during the restoration by the King's younger brother who had been crowned as Louis XVIII, and Pellerin's great-grandson Arnaud III de La Porte was created a baron in recognition, in 1822. That title remains in the family to this day.

The newly enthroned and installed primate and Archbishop of Melanesia is Leonard Dawea. He succeeds the retired archbishop George Takeli.  History  John Coleridge Patteson died a martyr's death in 1871 The church was established by George Selwyn in 1849, and was initially headed by a Bishop of Melanesia. One of the important features of the province's life over many years has been the work of a mission vessel in various incarnations known as the Southern Cross. First based in New Zealand, the missionaries, mainly from Oxbridge and the public schools, established their base on Norfolk Island, bringing Melanesian scholars there to learn Christianity until the school was closed in 1918. The many languages in Melanesia made evangelisation a challenge. The Melanesian Mission adopted the language of the island of Mota in the Banks group of islands as the lingua franca. The Church of Melanesia is known for its pioneer martyrs, especially John Patteson, murdered in 1871, Charles Godden, killed in 1906, among several others.  Membership  Today, there are nearly 200,000 Anglicans out of an estimated population of over 800,000 in the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu as well as a newly formed parish in Noum√©a, New Caledonia.  Structure  The polity of the Church of Melanesia is episcopal, which is the same as all other Anglican churches. Since being made a province in 1975 the church has maintained a system of geographical parishes organised into dioceses, of which there are now nine. The spiritual head of the province is the Archbishop of Melanesia, whose metropolitan See is the Diocese of Central Melanesia. The dioceses are: Central Melanesia; Malaita, Vanuatu and New Caledonia (originally New Hebrides), and Ysabel (all 1975); Temotu (1981); Hanuato'o (1991); Banks and Torres (1996); Central Solomons (1997); and Guadalcanal (2013). =Parishes and priests= Each diocese except for Central Melanesia (the Honiara area) is divided into regions, each headed by a senior priest. The regions are further subdivided into parishes or districts (the two words being interchangeable), headed by a parish priest, usually called a rector. Parishes may be subdivided into subparishes, headed by assistant priests. Catechists are lay people appointed by a local community and authorised by the bishop to take services and look after the spiritual life of a village.  Worship and liturgy  St. Barnabas Anglican Cathedral, Honiara, Solomon Islands The Church of Melanesia embraces three orders of ordained ministry: deacon, priest and bishop. A local variant of the Book of Common Prayer is used, called A Melanesian English Prayer Book.A Melanesian English Prayer Book Its predecessor in local liturgical development was A Book of Common Prayer Authorised for Use in Churches and Chapels in the Diocese of Melanesia, first published in 1938.http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/Melanesia/1938/index.html Society of St Justus website.  Doctrine and practice  See also: Anglicanism and Anglican doctrine The centre of the Church of Melanesia's teaching is the life and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The basic teachings of the church are summed up in the Apostle's Creed and the Nicene Creed. The focus of the church's worship is the celebration of the Holy Eucharist, sometimes called \\"Mass\\", but more often \\"Communion\\" or \\"Communion service\\". This is celebrated weekly wherever there is a priest and in some communities it is celebrated daily, except for Saturdays. Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer are offered in most churches and congregations daily, and Evening Prayer, \\"Evensong\\", is often sung (except for the Psalms) on Sundays and feasts. Feast days are celebrated by most communities on a Sunday near the feast day, or at least in the same month. The church in its canons accepts and teaches the seven sacraments of the Church, Baptism, Holy Eucharist, Confirmation, Penance, Holy Matrimony, Holy Orders, and Anointing of the Sick. =Ecumenical relations= Like other Anglican churches, the Church of Melanesia is a member of the ecumenical World Council of Churches, and is a member of the Pacific Conference of Churches, the Solomon Islands Christian Council, and the Vanuatu Council of Churches. The Mothers' Union is quite active, as are the four religious communities active in the province, the Melanesian Brotherhood, the Society of Saint Francis, the Community of the Sisters of the Church and the Community of the Sisters of Melanesia. The province has its own liturgical customs and a calendar of saints. Anglican realignment The Church of Melanesia is a member of the Global South and has been involved in the Anglican realignment movement. David Vunagi attended the Global South Fourth Encounter at 19‚Äì23 April 2010, in Singapore. He also would be one of the signatories of the Global South Primates letter to the Crown Nominations Commission, at 20 July 2012.Global South Letter to the Crown Nominations Commission (20 July 2012) Nevertheless, other clergy have sided with the more liberal Anglican provinces, including Terry Brown, former Bishop of Malaita, who has spoken \\"as an 'out' gay man serving as bishop\\".

His father was half French and part Cherokee and Osage Indian.The War, The West and The Wilderness c.1979 by Kevin Brownlow Retrieved September 3, 2015 When his father died, his mother could not rear five children alone, so Blue and one of his brothers were admitted to the Indiana Soldiers' and Sailors' Children's Home. He eventually worked his way through Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. Blue grew to a height of . He played football and worked as a fireman, railroad worker, coal miner, cowpuncher, ranch hand, circus rider, lumberjack, and day laborer at the studios of D. W. Griffith. Career Blue had no theatrical experience when he came to the screen. His first movie was The Birth of a Nation (1915), in which he was a stuntman and an extra. Next, he played another small part in Intolerance (1916). He also was a stuntman or stand-in for Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree during the making of Macbeth (1916). Gradually moving to supporting roles for both D. W. Griffith and Cecil B. DeMille, Blue earned his breakthrough role as Danton in Orphans of the Storm, starring sisters Lillian and Dorothy Gish. Then, he rose to stardom as a rugged romantic lead along with top leading actresses such as Clara Bow, Gloria Swanson, and Norma Shearer. He was most often partnered with Marie Prevost, with whom he made several films in the mid-1920s at Warner Bros. Blue's finest silent-screen performance was as the alcoholic doctor who finds paradise in MGM's White Shadows in the South Seas (1928). Blue became one of the few silent stars to survive the talkie revolution; however, he lost his investments in the stock market crash of 1929. He rebuilt his career as a character actor, working until his retirement from films in 1954, though he continued playing character roles in various television series until 1960, mostly Westerns, such as Annie Oakley, starring Gail Davis and Brad Johnson. One of his more memorable roles was as the sheriff in Key Largo opposite Lionel Barrymore. For his contributions to the motion pictures industry, Monte Blue received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6290 Hollywood Boulevard on February 8, 1960. Personal life Blue divorced his first wife in 1923 and married Tova Jansen the following year. He had two children, Barbara Ann and Richard Monte. During the later part of his life, Blue was an active Mason and served as the advance man for the Hamid-Morton Shrine Circus. In 1963, while on business in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, he died after suffering a heart attack attributed to complications from influenza. He is interred next to his mother-in-law, actress Bodil Rosing, at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.Celebrities in Los Angeles CemeteriesResting Places Selected filmography Mae Murray and Blue in Broadway Rose (1922) Blue (left) with Miriam Cooper and Hobart Bosworth in a production still promoting Betrayed (1917) * The Birth of a Nation (1915) as Minor Role (uncredited) * The Absentee (1915) as Ignorance * The Wild Girl from the Hills (1915, Short) * Ghosts (1915) as Bohemian in Paris * The Noon Hour (1915, Short) as Ada's Brother * Editions de Luxe (1915, Short) as Conny Peters - Swindler * For His Pal (1915, Short) as Jo Price * Hidden Crime (1915, Short) as Grant - the Grazer * The Family Doctor (1915, Short) as Dr. John Montrose * Martyrs of the Alamo (1915) as Defender of the Alamo (uncredited) * The Price of Power (1916) as Minor Role (uncredited) * The Man Behind the Curtain (1916) (uncredited) * The Devil's Needle (1916) as Bartender (uncredited) * Hell-to-Pay Austin (1916) as Minor Role (uncredited) * Intolerance (1916) as The Strike Leader * The Vagabond Prince (1916) as Peasant (uncredited) * The Microscope Mystery (1916) as Jud * The Matrimaniac (1916, Short) as Assistant Hotel Manager (uncredited) * Jim Bludso (1917) as Joe Bower * Besty's Burglar (1917) as Victor Gilpin * Hands Up!

In 1980 the lane arrangements on the bridge were changed to provide a third lane, and a tidal-flow traffic management system was introduced, with two lanes northbound in the morning and two lanes southbound in the evenings.

Captain Cook Bridge connects Sans Souci to Taren Point. Tom Uglys Bridge connects Blakehurst to Sylvania. History The bridge was built as the last link in the Hornsby-Heathcote county road (although a number of route realignments followed), and serves a metropolitan function. Construction of the bridge allowed the decommissioning (in 1976) of Lugarno ferry, which had operated since 1843 on Surveyor-General Thomas Mitchell's line of the Illawarra Road. The ferry had operated between Lugarno and Illawong.\\"Alfords Point Bridge\\" , Roads and Traffic Authority, NSW Accessed 26 September 2006 See also *List of bridges in Sydney References Category:Bridges in Sydney Category:Bridges completed in 1973 Category:Concrete bridges in Australia Category:Road bridges in New South Wales Category:Roads with a reversible lane Category:Sutherland Shire Category:Georges River Council Category:City of Canterbury-Bankstown Category:Georges River ","title":"Alfords Point Bridge"},{"id":"5634164","text":"Coast Guard Station Eatons Neck is a United States Coast Guard station located on the northern tip of Eatons Neck on Long Island New York.

Deiss expanded his career into \\"industrial public relations\\" with clients in the pharmaceutical industry, specifically Pfizer. As a result of his continuing interest in writing and in the history of Italy, he decided to give up his business partnership, and devote full-time to his writing, which resulted in his second novel, The Blue Chips, a novel about big business medicine. In 1957 Deiss, living in Positano, Italy began in depth research at museums and academic institutions in Germany, Austria, and Italy that led to his third work, a biographical novel, The Great Infidel about Frederic the Second, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Sicily. While Deiss was involved in his biographical novel of Frederic the Second, he was drawn to the ancient monument cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii, spending time there since they were near his home in Positano.Villa Fontanana, Positano, Italy 1959-1970. On becoming Vice Director of the American Academy in Rome, he actively started exploring these ancient cities. Out of this effort he wrote, Herculaneum, Italy's Buried Treasure. This was followed by Captains of Fortune, which consisted of profiles of six famous Italian Condottieri (soldiers of fortune) from the medieval period to the renaissance. The eclectic interests of Deiss in historical Italy finally led to his The Roman Years of Margaret Fuller. In 1971, for his historical work relating to Italy, he was Knighted by that government. In his later years, Deiss devoted his time between Cape Cod and his home in Gainesville, Florida, where he was an adjunct professor in the Classics Department of the University of Florida.

Umar ibn Hafsun ibn Ja'far ibn Salim () (c. 850 ‚Äì 917), known in Spanish history as Omar ben Hafsun, was a 9th-century rebel against Ummayad power in southern Iberia. Ancestry The background of Umar ibn Hafsun has been the subject of conflicting claims. His contemporary, the poet ibn Abd Rabbih (860-940) referred to him as a Sawada, a descendant of black Africans. Writing a century later, ibn Hayyan recorded a pedigree for Umar ibn Hafsun, tracing his descent to a great-grandfather, Ja'far ibn Salim, who had converted to Islam and settled in the Ronda area of the Province of M√°laga in southern Spain. The pedigree then traces back several additional generations to one Count Marcellus (or perhaps Frugelo), son of Alfonso, apparently a Christian Visigoth. This pedigree was copied by later historians, including Ibn Idhari, Ibn Khatib, and ibn Khaldun, as well as the A'lam Malaga (History of Malaga) begun by ibn 'Askar and completed by Ibn Khamis, and more recent authors such as Reinhart Dozy, in his Histoire des Mussulmans d'Espagne (History of the Muslims of Spain).Ryan-Ranson, p. 291; Wasserstein, pp. 272-274; Christys, Christians in Al-Andalus, pp. 102. However, Wasserstein recently concluded that the pre-conversion portion of this pedigree was probably invented by Umar himself. Conde in 1820 indicated that Umar ibn Hafsun was \\"a man of pagan origin, of obscure and unknown ancestry.\\"Un hombre de or√≠gen pagano, de oscura y desconocida prosapia, llamado Omar ben Hafs, Jos√© Antonio Conde, Historia de la dominaci√≥n de los Arabes en Espa√±a, Madrid: Garcia, 1820, p. 295 Regardless, his family owned lands in Iznate, M√°laga where ibn Hafsun grew up.Houtsma, M. Th. et al. (eds.) (1913-1936) Encyclopaedia of Islam, pp. 981-982 Life Ibn Hafsun was born around 850 in the mountains near Parauta, in what is now M√°laga. A wild youth, he had a very violent temper and was involved in a number of disputes, even a homicide around the year 879. He joined a group of brigands, was captured by the wali (governor) of M√°laga, who merely imposed a fine (having not been informed of the homicide). The governor subsequently lost his post. Ibn Hafsun fled the jurisdiction to Morocco where he worked briefly as an apprentice tailorChejne, Anwar G., Muslim Spain, Its History and Culture, University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, 1974, p. 24 or stonemason. He soon returned to al-Andalus, albeit as an outlaw, and joined the bandits who were in rebellion against the caliphate, wherein he soon rose to a leadership position.Some sources suggest that he received significant help from his uncle Mohadir. \\"Omar Ben Hafsun\\" Originally he settled in the ruins of the old castle of Bobastro ( bubastar).The exact site of Bobastro is debated by modern archaeologists, although the claim has been made that it is Las Mesas de Villaverde, in the Sierra de la Pizarra mountain range near Ronda in the northern part of the province of Malaga (Ann Christys, Christians in al-Andalus, p. 103). He rebuilt the castle, and fortified the nearby town of Ardales. He rallied disaffected muwallads and mozarabs to the cause, playing off resentment at the unfair, heavy taxation and humiliating treatment they were receiving at the hands of Abd ar-Rahman and his successors.Ye'or, Bat; Kochan, Miriam and Littman, David (2002) Islam and Dhimmitude: Where Civilizations Collide Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, Madison, NJ, p. 63 He acquired castles and lands in a wide area, not only in Malaga, but including portions of the provinces of C√°diz, Granada (known then as \\"Elvira\\"), Ja√©n, and Seville. By 883 he had become the leader of the rebels in the provinces to the south and west of the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba. The year before, in 882, he is said to have fought the Emir in a battle in which ally Garc√≠a √ç√±iguez of Pamplona was killed. About 885, in order to be more centrally located and quicker to respond to external threats, ibn Hafsun moved his headquarters to the town of Poley, which is now known as Aguilar de la Frontera. After ibn Hafsun‚Äôs defeat by the forces of Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi at the battle of Poley in 891, he moved his headquarters back to Bobastro. In 898, Lubb ibn Muhammad, of the Banu Qasi, was marching an army to support Umar when the death of his father at Zaragoza forced Lubb to abandon the campaign. In 899, Ibn Hafsun renounced Islam and became a Christian, being christened as Samuel. His motivations seems to have been opportunistic,L√©vi-Proven√ßal, Histoire de l'Espagne Musulmane, Paris, 1950, vol. 1, p. 377, speaks of his \\"instability of character and opportunistic tendencies\\", while Wasserstein, p. 293, suggests his actions speak of \\"hasty opportunism, if not, necessarily, of instability\\". According to the Encyclopaedia of Islam, his conversion to Christianity is \\"far from being historically proved\\" and that he never sought to ally himself with the Christian north. hoping to obtain military support from Alfonso III of Asturias, who had met with indifference overtures by ibn Hafsun on behalf of ibn Marwan. His conversion attracted significant Mozarab support, but cost him the support of most of his Mullawad followers. He also built the Iglesia Moz√°rabe (\\"Mozarab Church\\") at the Bobastro. Ibn Hafsun remained a serious threat to C√≥rdoba, even though in 910 he offered allegiance to the Fatimid rulers of north Africa,Wasserstein, p. 293 and when Abd-ar-Rahman III became Emir of Cordoba in 912 he instigated a policy of annual Spring offensives against ibn Hafsun, using mercenary troops. In 913 they captured the city of Seville, and by the end of 914 had captured 70 of ibn Hafsun‚Äôs castles. In 916, he joined forces with the Umayyads in a campaign against northern Christian kingdoms, the reasons for this are obscure, as is whether it was done in contrition or merely as an expedient compromise. For a while, even taxes were paid to the Umayyads. Ibn Hafsun died in 917 and was buried in the Iglesia Mozarabe. His coalition then crumbled, and while his sons Ja'far, 'Abd-ar-Rahman and Hafs tried to continue the resistance, they eventually fell to 'Abd-ar-Rahman III's plots and armies. The last, Hafs, surrendered Bobastro in 928 and afterward fought with the Umayyad army in Galicia. With Bobastro's fall, the mortal remains of ibn Hafsun and his slain sons were exhumed by the emir and posthumously crucified outside the Mosque‚ÄìCathedral of C√≥rdoba.

She is credited with building the botanical collection at the California Academy of Sciences, in San Francisco. She published over 310 scientific articles and authored 395 land plant species names, the fourth- highest number of such names authored by any female scientist. There are seventeen currently recognized species named for her, as well as the genera Eastwoodia and Aliciella. Biography Alice Eastwood was born on January 19, 1859, in Toronto, Canada to Colin Skinner Eastwood and Eliza Jane Gowdey Eastwood. The family moved to Denver, Colorado, in 1873. In 1879, she graduated as valedictorian from Shawa Convent Catholic High School, in Denver. For the next ten years, Eastwood would teach at her alma mater, forgoing a college education. She was a self-taught botanist, and relied on knowledge from published botany manuals including Grey's Manual and the Flora of Colorado. Her botanical knowledge led her to being asked to guide Alfred Russel Wallace up the summit of Grays Peak in Denver. Eastwood was also a member of Theodore Dru Alison Cockerell's Colorado Biological Association. In 1891, after reviewing Eastwood's specimen collection in Denver, Mary Katharine Brandegee, Curator of the Botany Department at the California Academy of Sciences, hired Eastwood to assist in the Academy's Herbarium. There Eastwood oversaw tremendous growth of the Herbarium. In 1892, Eastwood was promoted to a position as joint curator of the Academy with Brandegee. By 1894, with the retirement of Brandegee, Eastwood was procurator and Head of the Department of Botany, a position she held until her 1949 retirement. She died in San Francisco on October 30, 1953. The Academy retains a collection of her papers and works. Work In her early botanical work, Eastwood made collecting expeditions in Colorado and the Four Corners region. She became close with the Wetherill Family, and visited Alamo Ranch in Mesa Verde often, beginning in July 1889. Long before that, she was considered a part of the family, and so did not sign the guest register on later trips. Each time Eastwood visited, she was particularly welcomed by Al Wetherill, who shared a sincere interest in her work. In 1892, he served as her guide on a 10-day trip to southeastern Utah to collect desert plants. Eastwood also made collecting expeditions to the edge of the Big Sur region, which at the end of the 19th century was a virtual frontier, since no roads penetrated the central coast beyond the Carmel Highlands. In those excursions she discovered several plants theretofore unknown, including Eastwood's willow and Hickman's potentilla. Eastwood was credited with saving the Academy's type plant collection after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Departing from the curatorial conventions of her era, Eastwood segregated the type specimens from the main collection. This classification system permitted her, upon entering the burning building, readily to retrieve nearly 1500 specimens. After the earthquake, before the Academy had constructed a new building, Eastwood studied in herbaria in Europe and other U.S. regions, including the Gray Herbarium, the New York Botanical Garden, the British Museum, and the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. In 1912, with completion of the new Academy facilities at Golden Gate Park, Eastwood returned to the position of curator of the herbarium and reconstructed the lost part of the collection. She went on numerous collecting vacations in the Western United States, including Alaska (1914), Arizona, Utah and Idaho. By keeping the first set of each collection for the Academy and exchanging the duplicates with other institutions, Eastwood was able to build the collection, Abrams noting that she contributed \\"thousands of sheets to the Academy's herbarium, personally accounting for its growth in size and representation of western flora\\". By 1942 she had built the collection to about one third of a million specimens, nearly three times the number of specimens destroyed in the 1906 fire. Eastwood is credited with publishing over 310 articles during her career. She served as editor of Zoe and as an assistant editor for Erythea before the 1906 earthquake, and founded a journal, Leaflets of Western Botany (1932‚Äì1966), with John Thomas Howell. Eastwood was director of the San Francisco Botanical Club for several years throughout the 1890s. In 1929, she helped to form the American Fuchsia Society. Her main botanical interests were western U.S. Liliaceae and the genera Lupinus, Arctostaphylos and Castilleja.

The area is not exactly defined by any governmental administrative region(s); nor does it always have a clear geographic boundary. Geography Southwest Alaska includes a huge, complex, and relatively unknown swath of terrain. It is over from the western Bering Sea coast to Cook Inlet. Although much of the region is coastal, it also includes tens of thousands of square miles of interior boreal forests, swamps, and highlands, and the immense mountain barrier of the southern Alaska/Aleutian Range. The Aleutian Range, part of the Ring of Fire, includes many of Alaska's volcanoes including Mount Katmai, Novarupta and the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, Mount Redoubt, Mount Iliamna, and Augustine Volcano. Southwest Alaska encompasses, roughly from west to east: the Pribilof Islands, Nunivak Island and other Bering Sea islands lying west of the Alaska coast and east of the Russian coast; the immense combined delta of the Yukon River and Kuskokwim River; hundreds of miles of interior highlands, including the lower and middle Kuskokwim drainages; the entire watersheds of Goodnews Bay and Bristol Bay and other parts of the southern coast, including mountain ranges and great interior lakes including the Wood-Tikchik Lakes, Lake Iliamna, and Lake Clark; the western heights of the Alaska Range, and its continuation southward as the Aleutian Range along the Alaska Peninsula and Aleutian Islands. The Kodiak Archipelago, in the Pacific east of the Alaska Peninsula, is the most eastern part of Southwest Alaska. Southwest Alaska consists roughly of the Aleutians East, Bristol Bay, Kodiak Island, Lake and Peninsula boroughs, plus the portion of the Kenai Peninsula Borough that lies west of Cook Inlet; along with the Aleutians West, Bethel, Dillingham, and Kusilvak census areas. These areas have a combined area of , slightly larger than California. Geology Volcanic eruptions and mountain-building are active along the Ring of Fire, while in far western Alaska lava fields only a few thousand years old are common. In between lie an incomplete record of rocks from as old as 2.07 Ga years to the Holocene. A sequence of continental fragments, seafloor, and island arcs, torn, rafted, and assembled by plate tectonics, form the Proterozoic, Paleozoic and Mesozoic basement for more recent Mesozoic and Cenozoic rocks deposited on top of, and intruded into, them. Demographics Kodiak Southwest Alaska had a population of 53,349 as of the 2000 census, less than one-tenth of Alaska's inhabitants. The population is in large part Alaska Native, with 58.1% identifying as entirely or partly \\"Native American\\" in the 2000 census. About 121 towns and villages, generally far apart and with populations in the hundreds, exist in the region. Southwest Alaska can be considered to be the areas assigned to 4 of the 12 land-holding Alaska Native Corporations in 1971 for selection of land and for corporate organization of villages under ANCSA. The Calista Corporation region is in the Yukon/Kuskokwim delta, the lower and middle reaches of the Kuskokwim River drainage, and the Bering Sea coast from the Yukon to Cape Newenham. It contains 56 villages with a total population of about 23,000 people;http://www.calistacorp.com/about/cultural_background.html Bethel (5,471), is the largest and is the commercial hub for the Kuskokwim region. The Calista region is outlined by the combined Kusilvak and Bethel Census Areas. Calista owns 4,997,263 acres (20,223 km2) of the 41,713,612 acres (168,809 km2) in the region, almost all the rest is owned by the state or federal government. In the Bristol Bay Native Corporation (BBNC) region Dillingham (2,466), is the largest town. The BBNC region has 29 villageshttp://www.bbnc.net/web/index.php?option=com_content&view;=category&layout;=blog&id;=5&Itemid;=5 and a total population of about 8000.http://www.bbnc.net/web/index.phpareaoption=com_content&view;=category&layout;=blog&id;=13&Itemid;=21 The Corporation region includes part of the Alaska Peninsula, the Bering Sea coast west to Cape Newenham and the lands draining onto that coast, as well as parts of the Alaska and Aleutian Ranges. The combined areas of the Dillingham Census Area, the Bristol Bay Borough, and the Lake and Peninsula Borough are almost coincident with the BBNC area. Koniag, Incorporated has a region which covers the Kodiak Archipelago and part of the Alaska Peninsula. Kodiak (6,334) on Kodiak Island is the largest town and the commercial hub of the area. The Corporation region is very similar to, but not exactly the same area as the Kodiak Island Borough, which has a population of about 14,000 people in 11 communities. Aleut Corporation's lands are on the Aleutian Islands and the western end of the Alaska Peninsula. The Corporation area is exactly the same as the Aleutians East Borough and the Aleutians West Census Area combined. Unalaska/Dutch Harbor (4,283), is the largest town. About 8000 people live in the region, in about a dozen towns, and several military towns. Natives in Southwest Alaska are mainly Central Yup'ik in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta and Bristol Bay areas, Alutiiq on the eastern Alaska Peninsula and Kodiak Island, Aleut in the Aleutians, Pribilofs, and the western Alaska Peninsula, and a few Dena'ina Athabaskans near the western shore of Cook Inlet. Economy Land in Southwest Alaska is owned and managed mainly by the federal government, the state of Alaska, and Alaska Native Regional Corporations including Calista, Cook Inlet, Bristol Bay, Aleut, and Koniag. There is little private land, other than that owned by the Native Corporations. The economy rests on resource extraction, subsistence, and government spending.http://www.iser.uaa.alaska.edu/Publications/u_ak/uak_remoteruraleconomyak.pdf Fishing, both commercial and recreational, is the mainstay of the economy. Much of the commercial fishing is conducted by non-residents. Kodiak and Unalaska are among the most productive fishing ports in the United States. The salmon, trout, king crab, and halibut fisheries are extremely lucrative. Bristol Bay's commercial sockeye salmon industry is the largest in the world. Approximately 80% of that catch is taken by non-locals. A part of the fishery is processed locally. Only a small share of the value of the harvest is captured in the region, mainly as wages, and taxes and royalties levied by local governments and Native Regional Corporations. Hunting and other tourism industries are dependable, although small and seasonal, parts of the economy. Mining, mainly for gold, platinum, and mercury, has been a consistent part of the Southwest Alaska economy since purchase from Russia. Although mining is currently occurring only on a small scale, a controversy rages over a number of proposed resource extraction projects. These include the proposed Pebble Mine, which would put a large open pit gold and copper mine at the headwaters of the Nushagak and Kvichak rivers in the Bristol Bay watershed. Also, the federal government is seeking to lift the moratorium on oil drilling leases in Bristol Bay. Most of the smaller settlements rely on subsistence activities. Most of the area's residents are shareholders in a Native Corporation. Wildlife Southwest Alaska is one of the richest salmon areas in the world, with the world's largest commercial salmon fishery in Bristol Bay. It also has one of the highest concentrations of brown bears, feeding on the salmon, as well as berries and other vegetation. Bear watching is a popular tourist attraction at Katmai National Park and Preserve. This area is also home to a number of caribou herds - the Mulchatna herd is the third largest in the state. The western limit for both caribou and bears is on Unimak Island, first in the Aleutian chain. More western Aleutian Islands have no mammals larger than a fox. In the summer, many species of migratory birds nest on the tundra here, and there are many large seabird rookeries in the Aleutian Islands. Transportation Only small local road systems exist in Southwest Alaska. Only a few closely adjacent villages are linked by roads. The area is easily accessible only by air, sea, or river. Alaska Airlines 737 passenger jets serve Bethel, King Salmon, Dillingham, Adak, Dutch Harbor, and Kodiak. Bethel is also a link between arriving ocean barges carrying freight or fuel and the smaller barges which continue up the Kuskokwim. Aniak, Iliamna and some other communities are accessible via scheduled flights from Anchorage on PenAir and smaller air carriers. The small carriers provide essential links onward to smaller communities. Alaska Marine Highway ferries connect Kodiak Archipelago, Alaska Peninsula, and a few Aleutian Island communities to the ports of Southcentral Alaska. A combination of ocean and river barges are important to the communities along the Kuskokwim and Yukon rivers. Snowmachine travel is a critical component of winter transport; an ice road for highway vehicles is used along portions of the Kuskokwim River.

Previously, he served as a Judge of the United States District Court for the Central District of California from February 4, 1998, to October 18, 2001, and as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of California from October 18, 2001, to February 28, 2011. Following his retirement from the bench in 2011, Moreno was counsel with Irell & Manella. Early life and family Moreno is the son of Mexican immigrants, his mother arrived in the country with few skills and no resources after the death of his father at a young age. He grew up in a home where Spanish was the first language and where no family member had an education beyond high school. In a speech at the UC Davis School of Law (King Hall), he told students, \\"I never in my wildest dreams thought that I could become one of seven judges on the highest court in the state. I want to emphasize to you the idea that no matter what your dreams may be, you can follow them.\\" A native of Los Angeles, Moreno grew up in a small community in Elysian Park known as Solano Canyon. He attended local public schools (such as Solano Elementary) before going east to Yale University, from which he graduated in 1970. Education and early legal career Moreno received his Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from Yale University in 1970 and his Juris Doctor from Stanford Law School in 1975. After graduating from law school and being admitted to the Bar in 1975, he served in the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office. As Deputy City Attorney, he prosecuted criminal and civil consumer protection cases, and handled politically sensitive and legislative matters for the City Attorney. In 1979, he joined the firm of Mori & Ota (which became part of Kelley Drye & Warren) representing the firm's business clients in its general commercial litigation practice. Judicial service Carlos Moreno's official portrait as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of California Moreno's service in the judiciary began with his appointment in 1986 to the Los Angeles Municipal Court, Compton Judicial District, by Governor George Deukmejian. In that capacity, he adjudicated criminal matters, with an emphasis on serious felony offenses, and supervised the court's civil department until 1993, when Governor Pete Wilson elevated him to the Los Angeles County Superior Court, where he presided over felony trials. Moreno was nominated by President Bill Clinton on July 31, 1997, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Central District of California vacated by Judge Robert Mitsuhiro Takasugi. He was confirmed by the Senate on February 3, 1998, and received commission on February 4, 1998. His service terminated on October 18, 2001, due to resignation. Moreno was appointed to the Supreme Court of California following his nomination by Governor Gray Davis. In November 2002, California voters confirmed Moreno for the remainder of the term of his deceased predecessor, Justice Stanley Mosk. In 2010, California voters confirmed Justice Moreno to a full 12-year term. As an Associate Justice of the California Supreme Court, Moreno reviewed on appeal a wide range of civil and criminal cases, which have substantial state and federal constitutional implications. With his appointment to the Supreme Court of California, he became only the third judge of Hispanic heritage to serve in the Court's nearly 150-year history, and the first in more than a decade, since Cruz Reynoso. On January 6, 2011, Moreno announced his intention to retire from the California Supreme Court effective February 28, 2011. After leaving the court, Moreno was counsel with the Irell & Manella. In April 2017, he began working as a mediator and arbitrator in Los Angeles. Awards and honors Moreno is the former president of the Mexican American Bar Association. He has been a member of the California Judges Association, the Presiding Judges Association and the Municipal Court Judges Association of Los Angeles County. He was also the president of the Yale Club of Southern California, and a member of the Stanford University Law School Board of Visitors. He currently serves as a director of the Arroyo Vista Family Health Center and the Western Justice Center Foundation. Moreno was honored with the Criminal Justice Superior Court Judge of the Year Award in 1997, from the Los Angeles County Bar Association, and was presented with the \\"For God, For Country, and For Yale\\" Award in 2001, recognizing him as a distinguished alumnus of Yale University. He also received an honorary degree from Southwestern University School of Law in May 2002 for his devotion to the justice system, young people and the community. In 2009, he was awarded the Yale Medal, which \\"is the highest award presented by the Association of Yale Alumni and is conferred solely to recognize and honor outstanding individual service to the University.\\" Possible nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court On May 13, 2009, the Associated Press reported that President Barack Obama was considering Moreno, among others, for possible appointment to the United States Supreme Court. Despite the potential nomination, he released a controversial dissent in Strauss v. Horton the same day President Obama nominated Sonia Sotomayor. U.S. Ambassador to Belize On July 8, 2013, President Obama announced his intent to nominate Moreno to be United States Ambassador to Belize. On July 9, 2013, Obama formally nominated Moreno to the post. On Wednesday, May 14, 2014, the United States Senate confirmed Moreno to his ambassadorship by voice vote. Moreno arrived in Belize on June 21, 2014 and presented his credentials to Governor General Sir Colville Young on June 24, 2014. He stepped down from the post at the end of Obama's term.

When used to uniquely identify a type of lymphoma, they are usually categorized as follicular () or diffuse () . The \\"small cleaved cells\\" are usually centrocytes that express B-cell markers such as CD20. The disease is strongly correlated with the genetic translocation t(14;18), which results in juxtaposition of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene with the heavy chain JH locus, and thus in overexpression of bcl-2. Bcl-2 is a well known anti-apoptotic gene, and thus its overexpression results in the \\"failure to die\\" motif of cancer seen in follicular lymphoma.

Retrieved 2009-08-15 She was educated by her mother and from a young age showed literary ability, contributing to the press both in prose and verse. In 1855 she decided to study painting in Europe, and towards the end of that year went with her mother to London. She was said to be the first Australian born woman artist to study abroad. She had a letter of introduction to Sir James Clark, through whom she met John Ruskin who showed much interest in her work. From London Ironside went to Rome, worked hard to become an artist and remained there for the rest of her life. Ironside was visited by the Prince of Wales and William Charles Wentworth, who each paid ¬£500 for a painting. In 1862 Ironside was represented in the New South Wales court of the London Great Exhibition, and her two pictures received good reviews from the critics. In Rome she had an excellent reputation as a painter, at the time of her death a fellow artist spoke of her flowers \\"painted as never were flowers painted before . . . her rich Titian-like colouring united to a purity of feeling that recalled the visions of Beato Angelico\\". Ironside died in Rome on 15 April 1867 of tuberculosis. She taken back to London and interred at West Norwood Cemetery. Marriage at Cana of Galilee, 1861 and reworked two years later Good as her reputation was in Rome she was soon forgotten in her native country, and no specimen of her work is in any of its national galleries. Three of her pictures, The Pilgrim of Art, The Marriage in Cana, and The Presentation of the Magi were sent to Australia and lent to the national gallery at Sydney, where Francis Adams found them about 1888 stored \\"in a sort of shed\\" as there was \\"not room enough in the gallery\\". Adams praised them highly, and suggested that room might be found in the Melbourne gallery by taking out three by George Folingsby, and putting Miss Ironside's pictures in their place. They eventually found a home in the dining hall of St Paul's College, Sydney University. The Marriage at Cana of Galilee was presented to the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 1992 by the Warden and Fellows of the college.

Festivals and attractions Ballan Autumn Festival Light Horse re-enactors * A Vintage Machinery and Vehicle Rally is held in February, well known for its vintage tractor pull. * An Autumn Festival is held in Ballan every year in late March. * BuzzConf, a technology and futurist festival, is held in Ballan every November. * Although there is a mineral spring at Ballan, it does not have the high profile of the towns of Hepburn Springs and Daylesford further to the north. * To the south of Ballan are the Brisbane Ranges National Park and the You Yangs Forest Park. Community Groups * Ballan & District CWA - The Ballan CWA was established in September 1937; and the first meeting was held at Mrs. Rae's Coffee Palace. A committee was established and was run by Mrs J Rhodes (President), Mrs Turley (Secretary) & Mrs A.Flack (Treasurer) and consisted of 10 other members. For 70 years, the office bearers have passed on the torch to their fellow sisters, keeping alive the traditions, recipes & spirit of the CWA. The Ballan branch has had 34 presidents, 12 secretaries & 9 treasurers, with some members serving multiple terms. During these 70 years, the extraordinary country women of the CWA Ballan branch had helped those in need by raising funds for medical, war and other charity groups. This was achieved by donations, providing entertainment, volunteering at the Ballarat Hospital, penny drives, hosting events such as debutante balls, film evenings, sports competitions, and were widely known and were in high demand for their catering. In 2007, the last group said their farewells. After a 9 year hiatus, (October 2016) the Ballan & District CWA branch was established with a fresh set of members, goals and attitudes. \\"Our branch is passionate about supporting our local & surrounding communities within the Moorabool Shire & of course bakes the best scones. One of the marvellous things about being part of a community, is that it enables us to welcome, connect & support people in ways we couldn't as individuals.\\" See also * Ballan railway station, Victoria File:Ballan Post Office and War Memorial.jpgBallan Post Office and War Memorial File:Ballan Mechanic's Institute.jpgBallan Mechanics' Institute File:Fisken and Inglis St's Ballan.jpgHorse trough on the corner of Fisken and Inglis Streets File:Court house.jpgOld Ballan Court House; now used as meeting place for Ballan Historical Society References * External links * Ballan District Health & Care * Ballan Online * Ballan & District CWA Category:Towns in Victoria (Australia) ","title":"Ballan, Victoria"},{"id":"5634274","text":"Rock burst damage at a deep US mine A rock burst is a spontaneous, violent failure of rock that can occur in high-stress mines. Although mines may experience many mining-related seismic events, only the tremors associated with damage to accessible mine workings are classified as rock bursts. The opening of mine workings relieves neighboring rocks of tremendous pressure, which can literally cause the rock to explode, or trigger abrupt movement on nearby geological structures. Rock bursts are a serious hazard; in South Africa, they kill roughly 20 miners each year.(Monroe and Wicander, 96) Details Rock bursts result from brittle fracturing of rock, causing it to collapse rapidly with violent spalling of rock that is approximately 100 to 200 tonnes, or more. This release of energy reduces the potential energy of the rock around the excavation. Another explanation is that the changes brought about by the mine's redistribution of stress trigger latent seismic events, deriving from the strain energy produced by its geological aspects. The likelihood of rock bursts occurring increases as the depth of the mine increases. Rock bursts are also affected by the size of the excavation (the larger the more risky), becoming more likely if the excavation size is around 180 m and above. Induced seismicity such as faulty methods of mining can trigger rock bursts. Other causes of rock bursts are the presence of faults, dykes, or joints.  Mitigation  Approaches for dealing with rock bursts can be divided into two categories: tactical measures, which can be taken locally and at short notice in response to a heightened level of rock burst hazard, and strategic measures, which must be integrated into the mine design process and long-term planning. = Tactical measures = A number of tactical measures have been used successfully to reduce rockburst hazards. They include: # Using support systems that absorb energy and deform without breaking. Even where these systems suffer damage, they are often able to limit falls of ground and permit access where other systems fail completely. # Using destress blasting can reduce rock burst hazards, particularly highly stressed brittle rock. Destress holes can be efficiently integrated into conventional rounds. Destress blasting of large volumes, however, can be more problematic. # Slowing the rate of extraction will often reduce the amount of seismicity in relation to tonnage mined and may actually prevent bursting under some conditions. = Strategic measures = Strategic measure that have been used successfully include: # A properly planned sequence of stoping for the whole ore body should be adopted and followed as closely as possible. # The merging of large excavations at depth should be avoided. # Pillars, or volumes of rock in between excavations, should be eliminated or reduced to a minimum. # Parallel veins should be stoped singly, the hanging wall vein first (footwall vein first if underhand mining). # Where veins branch, stoping should begin at the intersection and then progress away from the intersection one branch at a time. # Where possible, stoping should proceed away from a fault or other plane of weakness. # Mined-out areas should be filled, and filling should proceed concurrently with extraction and be kept as close to the face as possible.
