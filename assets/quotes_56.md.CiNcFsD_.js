The court considered whether the defendant - the chairman of a local cricket club, on behalf of its members - was liable in nuisance or negligence when cricket balls were hit over the boundary and onto the property of their neighbours, Mr and Mrs Miller, the plaintiffs. Facts Cricket had been played at a small cricket ground in Lintz, near Burnopfield, County Durham, since 1905, on land leased to the club by the National Coal Board. The National Coal Board also owned a field adjacent to the ground, which it sold to Stanley Urban District Council. The Council sold the land to Wimpey for development. A line of new semi- detached houses were built next to the ground in 1972, one of which, 20, Brackenridge, was bought by the Millers. The Millers' garden boundary was only from the nearest batting crease, and their house only further away. Several cricket balls were hit onto their property over the following years, causing minor damage to their house (chipped paintwork, broken roof tiles) and risking personal injury to the Millers. Despite measures taken by the club to minimise recurrences, including the erection of a high fence in March 1975 on top of a boundary wall and asking batsmen to try to hit fours rather than sixes, a few balls continued to be hit out of the ground each season. For example, in 1975, 36 matches were played over 20 weeks in the summer, with 2,221 six-ball overs being bowled. Out of the 13,326 legitimate deliveries (ignoring no-balls and wides) there were 120 sixes, of which six crossed the fence and fell into the housing estate. The club offered to meet the cost of any property damage (£400), and suggested further countermeasures, such as louvred window shutters, and a net over the Millers' garden. The Millers were not content and sued for damages and an injunction to prevent cricket being played on the ground. The case is well known for the lyrical opening to Lord Denning's judgment, the first paragraph of which reads: > In summertime village cricket is the delight of everyone. Nearly every > village has its own cricket field where the young men play and the old men > watch. In the village of Lintz in County Durham they have their own ground, > where they have played these last 70 years. They tend it well. The wicket > area is well rolled and mown. The outfield is kept short. It has a good club > house for the players and seats for the onlookers. The village team play > there on Saturdays and Sundays. They belong to a league, competing with the > neighbouring villages. On other evenings after work they practise while the > light lasts. Yet now after these 70 years a judge of the High Court has > ordered that they must not play there any more. He has issued an injunction > to stop them. He has done it at the instance of a newcomer who is no lover > of cricket. This newcomer has built, or has had built for him, a house on > the edge of the cricket ground which four years ago was a field where cattle > grazed. The animals did not mind the cricket. But now this adjoining field > has been turned into a housing estate. The newcomer bought one of the houses > on the edge of the cricket ground. No doubt the open space was a selling > point. Now he complains that when a batsman hits a six the ball has been > known to land in his garden or on or near his house. His wife has got so > upset about it that they always go out at week-ends. They do not go into the > garden when cricket is being played. They say that this is intolerable. So > they asked the judge to stop the cricket being played. And the judge, much > against his will, has felt that he must order the cricket to be stopped: > with the consequence, I suppose, that the Lintz Cricket Club will disappear. > The cricket ground will be turned to some other use. I expect for more > houses or a factory. The young men will turn to other things instead of > cricket. The whole village will be much the poorer. And all this because of > a newcomer who has just bought a house there next to the cricket > ground.[1977] QB 966, at 976, per Lord Denning MR. Judgment =High Court= Reeve J. heard the case at first instance in the High Court in Nottingham. He delivered his judgment on 3 December 1976, granting the Millers the injunction they sought, and ordering the club to pay general damages of £150 for negligence and nuisance, for the inconvenience and interference with the use of the Millers' property. The defendants appealed against the injunction, and the plaintiffs cross-appealed for an increase in the award of damages. Michael Kempster QC and James N. Harper appeared as counsel for the club; James Chadwin QC and Frederick Such as counsel for the Millers at a two-day hearing on 31 March and 1 April 1977. =Court of Appeal= The Court of Appeal delivered its judgment on 6 April 1977. Geoffrey Lane and Cumming-Bruce LJJ held that there was a foreseeable risk of injury to the plaintiffs and their property from the cricket balls and the club could not prevent accidents from happening. The club was guilty of negligence \\"on each occasion when a ball comes over the fence and causes damage to the plaintiffs\\".[1977] QB 966, at 985, per Geoffrey Lane LJ. The repeated interference with their property was also held to be an actionable nuisance. Following Sturges v. Bridgman, the fact that the Millers had \\"come to the nuisance\\" was no defence. On that basis, the Millers were awarded damages. Lord Denning MR dissented from the finding of negligence and nuisance, holding that \\"the public interest should prevail over the private interest\\".[1977] QB 966, at 981, per Lord Denning MR. However, on the basis that the club had agreed to pay for any damage, Lord Denning was \\"content that there should be an award of £400 to cover any past or future damage\\". Geoffrey Lane LJ would have upheld the injunction. However, Lord Denning MR and Cumming-Bruce LJ held that damages were a sufficient remedy, holding that the discretionary equitable remedy of an injunction was not necessary. In the words of Cumming- Bruce LJ, the court had to \\"strike a fair balance between the right of the plaintiffs to have quiet enjoyment of their house and garden without exposure to cricket balls occasionally falling like thunderbolts from the heavens, and the opportunity of the inhabitants of the village in which they live to continue to enjoy the manly sport which constitutes a summer recreation for adults and young persons\\".[1977] QB 966, at 988, per Cumming-Bruce LJ. The Millers had bought a house with the benefit of an open space adjacent to their land, and had to accept that the innocent and lawful use of the open land could restrict the enjoyment of their garden. It is notable that the court did not hold that holding cricket matches on the ground was negligent, per se; rather, there were separate negligent acts each time a ball left the ground. Not long after the case, the Millers moved house.Wilson, Court and Bowled: tales of cricket and the law (Wildy, Simmonds & Hill, 2014), p 235 See also *Bolton v Stone [1951] AC 850, [1951] 1 All ER 1078, in which the House of Lords considered negligence in another cricket case Notes External links * Lintz Cricket Club's page on the case * Full text of the Court of Appeal decision from BAILII.org Category:English tort case law Category:Lord Denning cases Category:English nuisance cases Category:1977 in British law Category:Court of Appeal (England and Wales) cases Category:1977 in case law Category:1977 in cricket ","title":"Miller v Jackson"},{"id":"4889587","text":"Hedningarna is the eponymous first album by the Swedish band Hedningarna.

Using various instruments, such as hurdy-gurdies, moraharpas, bagpipes and fiddles, the album proves Hedningarnas' ability to mix old and new styles, and the album honors the old Scandinavian musical traditions, while managing to combine these with more modern sounds.

The line has a total length of and connects the municipalities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, as well as the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Anhui and Jiangsu. It is commonly referred to as the Jinghu railway, taking on the abbreviated names of the two terminal cities. In Chinese, Jing means \\"capital\\" and refers to Beijing, and Hu is the abbreviated name for Shanghai. History The Beijing–Shanghai railway is composed of three sections. These three sections are some of the earliest railways in China, built before 1910 during the Qing dynasty. The first section is from Beijing to Tianjin, constructed as part of the Imperial Railways of Northern China between 1897 and 1900. The second section is from Tianjin to Pukoua suburb of Nanjingand used to be called the Tianjin–Pukou railway. The third section is from Nanjing to Shanghai, built between 1905 and 1908. This section is called Shanghai–Nanjing railway. During 1927–1949, however, when China's capital was Nanjing, this section alone was called the \\"Jinghu\\" railway. Between Pukou and Xiaguan, the railway crosses the Yangtze River. Before the completion of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge in 1968, the trains were ferried across car-by-car. Passengers could also disembark at Nanjing North (Pukou), take a passenger ferry, and take a train again at the then Nanjing main station south of the river (now known as Nanjing West). After the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was completed in 1968, these three sections were linked together and renamed as a single Beijing–Shanghai or Jinghu railway. Current status The railway line is the principal line between Beijing and Shanghai and along with the Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway, it serves as one of the busiest rail corridors in China. It has dual tracks between Beijing and Shanghai, and the full length of the railway has been electrified. The entire line is dual tracked. Passenger rail service now offers overnight service on CRH Sleepers (D-series trains). D type express overnight sleeper bullet trains have now commenced operation between Beijing and Nanjing/Shanghai/Hangzhou.. There are currently 6 overnight D bullet trains. Overnight Bullet trains take between 9 hours and 23 minutes to 9 hours, 36 minutes between Beijing and Nanjing and were Soft sleeper only but now changed to sleeper first-class and sleeper second-class, which provide better facilities than Soft and Hard sleepers on conventional trains respectively. Some trains also have second- class seat cars. On June 30, 2011, the Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway opened and runs roughly parallel to the Beijing–Shanghai railway. The opening of the high-speed railway relieved the Beijing–Shanghai railway from overcrowding, and it's increasingly shifted to freight traffic. As of 2017, two regular trains per day (not including aforementioned overnight sleepers) go the full way from Beijing to Shanghai on the old line, although hundreds of trains still use selected sections of it.

After the massacare of Piet Retief and his men by Dingaan on 6 February 1838, a number of Voortrekker camps were also attacked by the Zulu impis. These Voortrekkers appealed to other treks, particularly those of Piet Uys and Hendrik Potgieter in the Orange Free State, for help. Both treks send out commandos to help, including Uys' fifteen-year-old son, Dirkie. During the subsequent Battle of Italeni, Piet Uys was mortally wounded by an assegai while riding to the rescue of two of his cornered men. The rescue party failed. Opinions of what happened next differ: According to the most common version (mostly told by people who had not been present at the battle), Dirkie Uys was ahead of his father with most of the party when he heard his father ordering one of his men to leave him where he had fallen. Seeing the Zulus closing in on his father, Dirkie Uys turned around his horse, shouting \\"I will die with my father\\", and charged. He shot three Zulu warriors, briefly forcing them to retreat, but they rushed at him and stabbed him off his horse. Dirkie Uys fell beside his father, where they were both stabbed to death. This version of events is depicted on one of the historical friezes of the Voortrekker Monument. South Africa has a deep and significant history, one that is complex and integral to the identity of the modern Rainbow Nation. The Dirkie Uys Monument is one small part of the South African mosaic, a beautiful chapter in the long tale that has brought this country to the democratic, united point that we now enjoy. Dirk Uys and his father, Piet, served together in the Boer War, when the Voortrekkers fought against the Zulu warriors in bloody battles that led to the devastating loss of tens of thousands of British, Boer and African lives. Dirkie was only 15 years old, fighting under the command of his father, when the Zulu impis lured their commando into an attack. Piet was fatally wounded and, as he lay dying, commanded that his men, including Dirkie, flee and save themselves. But his son loyally stayed behind. Unable to leave his dying father at the mercy of the warring Zulu fighters, Dirkie stuck by his side, fighting off as many of the warriors as he could before he was finally killed, laid to a bloody rest next to his father. The Dirkie Uys Monument is situated in Somerset West, less than an hour’s drive outside Cape Town. It commemorates the loss of these two war heroes, but also the loss of the lives of all of the many other men, women and children that succumbed during this turbulent time in South Africa’s history. The monument comprises a stone bench, fashioned after an ox wagon wheel, as well as an ox wagon atop a stone structure bearing the date 1938 to celebrate the centenary of the Great Trek. The monument faces true north and is situated on the large piece of land between two churches (the NG Moedergemeente and the Ou Pastorie Church and Rectory). This is open to the public and there are no charges involved in seeing the monument. Sources *Ian S. Uys, \\"The Battle of Italeni\\", South African Military History Society.

The storm formed when two low pressure areas merged off the coast of Virginia and travelled up the coast; at its peak, it produced a storm surge of about ten feet in Cohasset harbor and hurricane-force winds in Nantucket. The storm killed more than 400 people and sank more than 150 boats and ships. It also changed the course of the North River, separating the Humarock portion of Scituate, Massachusetts, from the rest of Scituate.  Loss of the SS Portland  On November 26, 1898, the steamship SS Portland left India Wharf in Boston, Massachusetts, for Portland, Maine, on a regularly scheduled run. She never made it to port. None of the 192 passengers and crew survived the massive storm that wreaked havoc on New England's coast -- a storm that was later dubbed \\"the Portland Gale\\" after the tragic loss of the ship. For years, controversy reigned as to the location of the ill-fated ship. In the summer of 2002, Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary, joined by the National Undersea Research Center at the University of Connecticut (UConn), solved the mystery surrounding the Portland's location. Using data from American Underwater Search and Survey, they brought back images from the sea floor that conclusively identified the remains of the steamship Portland. Researchers from NOAA's Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary, along with the NOAA-UConn team and filmmakers from [The Science Channel], returned to the wreck of the famed 19th-century steamship from September 13–18, 2003. Kicking off the expedition to peer into the vessel's past and plan for its future, the team conducted the first surveys of the Portland since its location was confirmed in August 2002 within NOAA's Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary off the Massachusetts coast. In addition to documenting the Portland, the expedition team investigated the wrecks of the Louise B. Crary and Frank A. Palmer, a pair of Boston-bound coal schooners that collided and sank in 1902 as a result of a navigational error. Like the Portland, the Crary and Palmer lie within the boundaries of Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary. Side-scan sonar images obtained in 2002 during a joint mission between NOAA and NURC-UConn revealed that the two large vessels plunged to the sea floor simultaneously, their bows locked together in a deadly embrace.  Damage to coastal towns  Dozens of houses were destroyed in each of the towns along the South Shore of Massachusetts. Coastal railroads were damaged in Scituate and in Hull, telegraph and electric lines were severed, and the ferris wheel and roller coaster in Hull were destroyed. The Duxbury pier was damaged, beaches were badly eroded, and dozens of ships and boats were wrecked on the beaches.  Change to the course of the North River  The southern coast of Scituate, Massachusetts, is marked by four distinct flaws, running from First Cliff on the northern end of the town's coast down to Fourth Cliff in the southern end. The area surrounding and including Fourth Cliff is called Humarock. Prior to the Portland Gale, the North River flowed south between Fourth Cliff and Marshfield, Massachusetts, joining the South River and entering the ocean two kilometers to the south of the current opening. A thin strip of beach, which connected Third Cliff to Fourth Cliff, was breached by the storm, leaving Fourth Cliff an island. Eventually the old inlet has silted in, forcing the South River to flow north between Marshfield and Fourth Cliff, where it now joins the North River to enter the ocean between Third and Fourth Cliffs. Although Fourth Cliff is now connected by land to Marshfield, North of Rexhame Beach, there are no roads across the old inlet. As a result, Fourth Cliff and the rest of the Humarock part of Scituate are only accessible via the Marshfield Avenue and Julian Street bridges from Marshfield. The change to the course of the North River also increased the salinity of the large marsh area surrounding the current outlet, resulting in the loss of the valuable salt haying business.

It was one of several air bases built and used by the United States Air Force (USAF) during the Vietnam War. Cam Ranh Air Force Base was part of the large Cam Ranh Bay logistics facility built by the United States. It was the major military seaport used by the United States for the offloading of supplies, military equipment and as a major Naval base. Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force units all had compounds and units assigned to the Cam Ranh Bay facility from its opening in 1965 until its closure in 1972 as part of the drawdown of United States military forces in South Vietnam. Between 1979 and 2002, the facility was used by the Soviet Navy and then Russian Navy. At the end of 2013, Russia resumed the use of the base by its Navy and in 2014 by its Air Force. On 19 May 2004, after major reconstruction, Cam Ranh Airport received its first commercial flight. As Vietnam considers the facility to be important to its defense, a small garrison of troops are stationed there. US military use of Cam Ranh Air Base Map of US facilities at Cam Ranh Bay in 1969 McDonnell Douglas F-4C (S/N 64-770) of the 558th Tactical Fighter Squadron, December 1968 C-7B Serial No 63-9725 of the 535th Tactical Airlift Squadron, October 1971 In April 1965 CINCPAC instructed an engineering survey for a new airfield at Cam Ranh Bay. In mid-1965, the American construction consortium RMK-BRJ was directed by the Navy Officer in Charge of Construction RVN (OICC RVN) to construct a new airfield at Cam Ranh Bay, starting with a temporary runway consisting of 2.2 million square feet (200,000 square meters) of AM-2 aluminum matting to accommodate jet fighter- bombers. By September, RMK-BRJ had employed 1,800 Vietnamese workers for the work, over half of whom were women. The runway was completed in 50 days, with Admiral U.S.G. Sharp, CINCPAC, laying the last AM-2 plank on 16 October 1965. The airfield was opened for U.S. Air Force operations on 1 November 1965. A 1.3 million square feet (120,000 square meters) cargo apron using pierced steel planking, airport facilities and utilities, mess halls, and 25,000 square feet (2,300 square meters) of living quarters were also prepared for use by the USAF. By the end of 1966, RMK-BRJ and OICC RVN completed construction of an additional concrete runway and taxiway at the air base.Once the concrete runway was built, the original AM-2 runway was to be removed and replaced with a new concrete runway. In addition between June and September US Army engineers built fuel storage areas and of roads and lengthened the pier before handing over the work to RMK-BMJ. In July 1965 it was planned that 3 fighter squadrons would be deployed to Cam Ranh Air Base once it was completed in October. On 28 October 1965 an advance party of the 43rd Tactical Fighter Squadron arrived at the base, the squadron equipped with F-4C Phantom II fighter-bombers arrived on 1 November and began flying missions over South Vietnam the following day. =12th Tactical Fighter Wing= On 8 November 1965 the 12th Tactical Fighter Wing was assigned to the base, being deployed from MacDill Air Force Base, Florida. The 12th TFW was the first permanently assigned F-4 Phantom II wing assigned to Southeast Asia. Operational squadrons of the wing at Cam Ranh were: * 557th Tactical Fighter Squadron 1 December 1965 – 31 March 1970 (F-4C Tail Code: XC) * 558th Tactical Fighter Squadron 8 November 1965 – 31 March 1970 (F-4C Tail Code: XD/XT) * 43rd Tactical Fighter Squadron 8 November 1965 – 4 January 1966 (F-4C) * : Replaced by: 559th Tactical Fighter Squadron 1 January 1966 – 31 March 1970 (F-4C Tail Code: XN) * 391st Tactical Fighter Squadron 26 January 1966 – 22 July 1968 (F-4C Tail Code: XT) diverted from the still incomplete Phan Rang Air Base From Cam Ranh AB the wing carried out close air support, interdiction, and combat air patrol activities over South Vietnam, North Vietnam and Laos. On 26 October 1966 and on 23 December 1967, US President Lyndon B. Johnson landed at the base on his only Presidential visit to South Vietnam, meeting US military personnel. Lyndon Johnson with General William Westmoreland at Cam Ranh Air Base, 23 December 1967 HH-43B of Detachment 8, 38th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron at Cam Ranh, January 1968 On 31 March 1970, as part of the Vietnamization process the 12th TFW was reassigned to Phù Cát Air Base. Heavy rainfall and strong onshore winds from December 1965 to March 1966 undermined the sand base of the original aluminum mat runway and taxiways at the base, necessitating constant maintenance to smooth out bumps and replace damaged matting. By December 1966 Cam Ranh AB reached over 27,000 aircraft movements a month. Living conditions at the base remained spartan with cramped quarters and shortages of water and electricity. =Airlift use= The air base also was used as a strategic and tactical airlift facility. Cargo and personnel would arrive from the United States into the logistics facilities at Cam Ranh Bay by ship and also by large Military Air Transport Service/Military Airlift Command (MAC) airlifters, and then be transferred to tactical airlift for movement within South Vietnam. Outgoing cargo and personnel would also be processed through the large aerial port facility. In November 1965 315th Air Division C-130E squadrons based in Japan, Okinawa, Taiwan and the Philippines began \\"shuttle\\" missions out of the airfield. C-130s from Tan Son Nhut Air Base and Nha Trang Air Base made pickups at Cam Ranh, as did C-123s. In May 1966 C-130As formerly used for flareship operations at Da Nang Air Base began operations from Cam Ranh and by November 1966 13 C-130As were based there. On 1 December 1965 the 14th Aerial Port Squadron was activated at the base to manage the airfield. In 1966 a new ramp was constructed on the west side of the airfield to handle airlift operations. Cam Ranh remained as the Air Force's primary airlift base in South Vietnam until it closed. MAC aircraft also operated into Cam Ranh. The 6485th Operations Squadron based at Tachikawa Airfield (and later moved to Clark Air Base) stationed 4 C-118 Liftmasters on rotation at the base for casualty evacuation. On 8 July 1966 the 903d Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron was established at Tan Son Nhut AB and it maintained a detachment at Cam Ranh. In November 1966 the first MAC C-141 Starlifter landed at Cam Ranh AB. In April 1967 medical evacuation flights began from the base to Andrews Air Force Base. = 483rd Tactical Airlift Wing = On 15 October 1966 the 483rd Troop Carrier Wing was activated at Cam Ranh under the recently activated 834th Air Division to operate the former US Army CV-2 Caribous (later redesignated C-7A) which were transferring to the USAF. Squadrons assigned to the 483rd TAW were: * 457th Troop Carrier Squadron, 1 January 1967 – 30 April 1972 (C-7A Tail Code: KA) * 458th Troop Carrier Squadron, 1 January 1967 – 1 March 1972 (C-7A Tail Code: KC) * 459th Troop Carrier Squadron, 1 January 1967 – 1 June 1970 * 535th Troop Carrier Squadron, 1 January 1967 – 24 January 1972 * 536th Troop Carrier Squadron, 1 January 1967 – 15 October 1971 * 537th Troop Carrier Squadron, 1 January 1967 – 24 January 1972 * Royal Australian Air Force, No. 35 Squadron assigned to 834th Air Division, 1 January 1967 – 24 January 1972: Assigned to: Vung Tau Army Airfield In January 1967 the 483rd Consolidated Maintenance Squadron formed at the base. On 15 August 1967 the C-130 detachments from the 315th Air Division were assigned to the 834th Air Division as Detachment 2 and by 4 January 1968 this force numbered 35 C-130A/Cs. Due to its location on a peninsula, Cam Ranh AB was one of the most secure USAF bases in South Vietnam and was not attacked during the January–February 1968 Tet Offensive. Given its security and attacks on other air bases, many transport aircraft from other less secure bases operated from Cam Ranh in early February. With the inactivation of the 12th Tactical Fighter Wing, the 483rd became the host wing at Cam Ranh Bay on 31 March 1970. In mid-1970 the 903d Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron moved to the base. On 9 July 1970 the first MAC C-5 Galaxy landed at the base, due to security and congestion issues at other bases it was initially the only base used by the C-5. On 30 August 1970 a Viet Cong (VC) rocket attack on the base destroyed 2 420,000 gallon jet fuel storage tanks. On 25 August 1971 a VC sapper attack on the base's tri-service ammunition storage area destroyed over 6000 tons of munitions with a value of more than US$10 million. On 16 September 1970 the 39th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron equipped with HC-130Ps relocated from Tuy Hoa Air Base to Cam Ranh. In March 1971 the squadron moved to Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base. Commencing in September 1971 the C-7 squadrons at the base began to be inactivated. On 1 December 1971, the wing was reassigned from the 834th Air Division directly to Headquarters, Seventh Air Force at Tan Son Nhut AB. It gained a tactical electronic warfare mission in mid-1971 and a special operations mission in the autumn of 1971. These squadrons were: * 20th Special Operations Squadron, 1 September 1971 – 1 April 1972 (UH–1P, No Tail Code) * 90th Special Operations Squadron, 1 September 1971 – 15 April 1972 * 360th Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron, 31 August 1971 – 1 February 1972 (EC-47N/P/Q Tail Code: AJ) * 361st Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron, 31 August – 1 December 1971 (EC-47N/P/Q Tail Code: AL) * 362nd Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron, 31 August 1971 – 1 February 1972 (EC-47N/P/Q C-47H Tail Code: AN) For its service in Vietnam, the 483rd was awarded two Presidential Unit Citations (21 January – 12 May 1968; 1 April – 30 June 1970) and three Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards with combat \\"V\\" device (1 January – 30 April 1967; 1 May 1967 – 30 April 1968; 1 July 1970 – 31 December 1971). USAF withdrawal and South Vietnamese use of Cam Ranh Air Base Beginning on 1 January 1972, the 483d Tactical Airlift Wing phased down its activities, and active flying ended by 31 March. The unit was inactivated and Cam Ranh Air Base was turned over to the South Vietnamese government on 15 May 1972, ending USAF use of the facility.Cam Ranh Bay American Withdrawal 1972 (Video) After the turnover to the South Vietnamese the base was largely abandoned. It was, quite simply, much too big for the Vietnamese to use. The base was slowly looted for its usable equipment, such as air conditioners, desks, refrigerators, and other furniture along with windows, doors and corrugated tin roofs from the buildings left by the Americans, leaving what could be categorized as a deteriorating ghost town of abandoned buildings. Camh Rhan AB Ghost Town, Part 1 (Video)Camh Rhan AB Ghost Town, Part 2 (Video) The Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) used the airfield as a storage facility for many of their A-1 Skyraiders, while their replacement jet F-5s and A-37s were used in operations against the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) from other, smaller bases. On 3 April 1975 the PAVN 10th Division advanced on Cam Ranh Bay and despite scattered resistance from the Army of the Republic of Vietnam and RVNAF airstrikes by 14:00 they had captured the entire base area. Soviet and Russian use of Cam Ranh facilities Tu-142Ms pictured) In 1979, the Soviet Union started leasing the base rent-free from Vietnam under a 25-year leasing treaty. The base, aside from serving as a communications and signal-intelligence collection centre, eased Soviet logistical support of its naval forces that were deployed in the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean. The base was especially important given the nature of the Soviet Union's Pacific bases in the Far East, which, unlike the warm-water Cam Ranh Base, were restricted to various degrees due to ice. The first Soviet naval ships arrived at the base in March 1979. In addition to the two piers, the Soviets added five more, as well as building two dry docks, installations to admit nuclear submarines, fuel and weapons storage facilities, and barracks. Under Soviet administration, Cam Ranh became its largest naval base for forward deployment outside the Warsaw Pact. Some 20 ships were berthed daily at the base, along with six attack submarines. In addition, the Soviet Air Force stationed MiG-23 fighters, Tupolev Tu-16 tankers, Tupolev Tu-95 long-range bombers, and Tupolev Tu-142 maritime reconnaissance aircraft at Cam Ranh Air Base. During the 1980s many Tokyo Express flights went to and from the base, sometimes violating Japanese airspace. Offensive weapons, including the MiG-23s and Tu-16s, had been withdrawn by 1989, and the number of personnel was halved to 2,500 from a high of 5,000. The Russian government continued the earlier Soviet arrangement in a 1993 agreement that allowed for the continued use of the base for signal intelligence, primarily on Chinese communications in the South China Sea. By this time, Russian aircraft had been withdrawn, with only support personnel for the listening station remaining. In June 2001, the Vietnamese government announced that following the expiration of Russia's lease in 2004, Vietnam would \\"not to sign an agreement with any country to use Cam Ranh Bay for military purposes\\". On 17 October that year, the Russian government announced that it would be withdrawing from Cam Ranh Bay completely before its rent-free lease was to expire in 2004, due to what was assumed to be a dwindling defense budget. The reversion of the base back to Vietnamese control took place on 2 May 2002. On 25 November 2014, an agreement was signed during a visit to Sochi by Nguyễn Phú Trọng, that established standards of use of Russian warships in the port of Cam Ranh simplified procedure:Москва швартуется к Камрани Russian ships would only have to give prior notice to the Vietnamese authorities before calling on Cam Ranh Bay, while other foreign navies would be limited to only one annual ship visit to Vietnamese ports.What Should the United States Do about Cam Ranh Bay and Russia’s Place in Vietnam? In January 2015, Russia's Defense Ministry said that Russian Il-78 tanker aircraft had used Cam Ranh Bay in the previous year, enabling the refueling of the Tu-95 strategic bombers conducting flights in the Asia-Pacific region.

Its functions include assisting the executive with legal advice and being the supreme court for administrative justice. Its members are (for the most part) high level jurists. The Council is taking residence in the Palace of the Marquess of Assche built by Alphonse Balat. History After Belgium gained its independence from the Netherlands, the Belgian government was hesitant to create a Council of State, given the perceived abuse of the Dutch Council of State; thus, no Council of State was created in Belgium. After World War II the need arose for a Supreme Administrative Court, and such an organ was created by the law of 23 December 1946 as a body that administers justice. It does not officially belong to the judiciary; rather, it falls under the jurisdiction of the minister of the interior. Since then, the Belgian Constitution has been amended to include the existence of the Council of State. Article 160 of the Belgian Constitution provides that there is, for all of Belgium, one Council of State, the composition, competence and functioning of which are regulated by law. The organisation and functioning of the Council of State are presently provided for by the organic laws on the Council of State, coordinated by the Royal Decree of 12 January 1973. Organisation and Competence =Organisation= View of the in Brussels which accommodates the Council of State. The Council of State comprises the council, the auditeurs' office, the coordination office, the registry and the administrative staff. The Council is further divided into a Legislative section and an Administrative litigation section. The Council has 44 judges: * a First President * a President * 14 Presidents of Chambers * 28 Councillors The judges themselves elect their Presidents. Chamber Presidents are elected from those judges who are at least three years on the bench, Presidents and the First President are elected from judges at least eleven years with the Council of State of which at least five years as a judge. The aforementioned judges are appointed for life by the King out of a list containing three names nominated by the Council of State itself. If the nominating list was made unanimous by the Council of State, the person topping the list will be appointed unless the minister of the interior vetoes the appointment because the conditions of the law are not met. If the minister accepts these nominations then he/she proceeds to notify the Belgian Senate and the Belgian Chamber of People's Representatives, which can refuse the nominations if they consider the number of former auditeurs to have grown to large. In this case the Council of State drafts a new list. If the list with nominations by the Council was not unanimous then the Chamber or Senate can draft a new list containing three names, the King will proceed to appoint one of the candidates from these two lists. In order to become a judge on the Council of State the following conditions must be met: *at least 37 years of age *legal degree *at least ten years of legal experience *one of the following conditions: **succeeded in a government exam for auditeur or referendaris **administrative function of rank 15 in a Belgian civil service **holder of a doctorate in law **Belgian magistrate **professor of law at a Belgian university. The Council has its seat at the following address: Wetenschapsstraat/rue de la Science 33 in Brussels. =Jurisdiction= The Belgian Council of State was modelled after her French namesake with greatly similar powers. Litigation The Council hears cases against decisions of the federal government (royal decrees, regulations issued by ministers, decisions by committees with a national competency) and decisions of the regional governments and the governments of the communities (executive orders, regulations issued by ministers,...) as well as against decisions of the provincial and municipal governments and decisions of various state organs. The Council of State examines the conformance of these regulations and administrative decisions with respect to the Constitution, (higher) administrative decisions, the general principles of Law, statute law, international treaties and conventions. The general principles of Law are principles that are not found in any statute, yet derive from the spirit of the body of law; they are discovered by the Council and thus made into case law. The Council is the cassation jurisdiction for decisions by administrative courts of appeal, meaning that it hears cases in which the plaintiff argues that the court of appeal ignored or misinterpreted law. The procedure is inquisitorial: the litigant writes a letter to the Council, stating precisely what happened and why he feels that the defendant acted illegally; the Council then starts an inquiry, asking the other party (generally, a government or government agency) for precisions, and so on until the Council has a clear picture of the case. The litigant does not have the burden of proof: the Council may well decide that the litigant was right and the government was wrong if the information supplied by the litigant was sufficient to enable it to find the missing proofs. Of course, both parties may supply supplemental information until the case is ready for final judgment. A litigant has to make his claim within 60 days after the publication of the regulation in the Belgisch Staatsblad/Moniteur Belge, or if it is a decision which affects only a limited number of people, within 60 days after he gets notified of it. In some cases, it is unclear whether a case should be heard before administrative courts or judiciary courts. In this case, Court of Cassation decides who has jurisdiction. Advisory capacity In principle, whenever federal Acts or Decrees are drawn up by the federal parliaments (federation, communities or regions) or Decrees by the federal government (Royal or Ministerial Decrees) or by a regional government, these must first before being adopted and published in the Belgisch Staatsblad/Moniteur Belge be sent to the Legislative Section for its advice. Normative texts coming from the executive power must be submitted for advice in draft form whereas for normative texts originating from a member of parliament, the advice is optional. The Council of State's advice will contain arguments with regards to the competence of the organ proposing the act or regulation, the legality vis-a-vis hierarchical rules as well as linguistic arguments.

It is about one hour away from the second largest city Portsmouth. It is one of only two airports in the island nation of Dominica, the other being Canefield Airport located three miles (5 km) northeast of Roseau. History The Melville Hall area was chosen as the site for Dominica's main airport in 1944, for it was the only place on the island with extensive flat land. It was only after the completion of the Transinsular Road from Belles to Marigot, in 1958, that work on the airport began. The facility opened on 22 November 1961, and was first served by Dakotas from BWIA. In 2006 an airport expansion and upgrade program began which entailed the expansion of the terminal building to include a new departure lounge, customs and immigration section and check in area. The runway and apron were also extended and new night landing and navigational aids were installed. These enhancements had an extended completion date of mid-2010. The first-ever night landing was conducted on 9 August 2010 by Winair. Regular night landings at the airport began on 20 September 2010; the first flight, from LIAT, flew from V.C.

Thanks to the silk industry, the village experienced a period of prosperity that lasted from the 19th century to the 20th century. This city now owes much of its economy to tourism. A heritage railway runs from Saint- Jean-du-Gard to Anduze with a stop at the Bambouseraie de Prafrance, which attracts 150,000 tourists a year.

It was established by the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) in 1962 at an undeveloped airstrip, and was used by the United States Air Force during the Vietnam War in the II Corps Tactical Zone of South Vietnam. It was captured by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) in March 1975 and was abandoned for many years. Today, the facility has been redeveloped as Pleiku Airport. Origins In January 1962, the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Vietnam requested the Department of Defense contract construction agent, the U.S. Navy Officer in Charge of Construction RVN (OICC), to design and construct a runway at Pleiku. The MAAG wanted the air field to be operational as a top priority by 1 July 1962. Although the design had not yet been started, the OICC tasked RMK-BRJ, the construction contractor, to begin work on 19 January. They installed 6,000 feet of pierced steel plank (PSP) runway with over-runs, a parallel taxiway, and aprons at a cost of $2.7 million. The airfield was completed on 20 June 1962. RMK-BRJ returned in 1964 to replace the PSP runway with three-inch asphalt pavement. The RVNAF 1st Fighter Squadron staged two AD-6 Skyraiders at Pleiku AB from late 1961 and this force was later increased to four A-1s and a C-47 flareship. In December 1962 Pleiku Air Base was activated by the RVNAF as Air Base 62 and in March 1964 Air Base 62 became the RVNAF 62nd Tactical Wing. The RVNAF 114th Liaison Squadron moved to Pleiku in 1963. In January 1965 the 62nd Wing and a detachment of the 516th Fighter Squadron moved to Nha Trang Air Base. Pleiku Air Base was then managed by the RVNAF 92nd Base Support Group and the base was used as a staging and emergency airfield. Use by the United States during the Vietnam War As North Vietnamese infiltration increased within and along the Laotian and Cambodian borders the importance of Pleiku Air Base increased, and base facilities were expanded and improved by American Army and Air Force civil engineering units. The base was jointly used for both RVNAF and USAF air activities, but never reached the saturation and population proportions of the major air bases of the coastal lowlands. The USAF forces stationed at Pleiku were under the jurisdiction of the Seventh Air Force, United States Pacific Air Forces (PACAF). The APO for Pleiku was APO San Francisco, 96318. The 4400th Combat Crew Training Squadron, code named Farm Gate began operations in South Vietnam in 1961. In 1962 a detachment of Farm Gate B-26 Invaders began operations from Pleiku AB and by February 1963 this had grown to 6 B-26s and 1 C-47. In March 1962 the II Air Support Operations Center became operational at the base. In June 1962 Detachment 1, 6220th Air Base Squadron was activated at the base. In December 1962 Detachment 3, 8th Aerial port Squadron was activated at the base. Army units: * 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) with Bell UH-1B Huey's from March 1963. * A detachment of 498th Medical Company (Air Ambulance) with UH-1D Hueys from October 1965. * 52nd Aviation Battalion was deployed here during December 1964. In late 1964 a detachment of 2 HH-43Bs were stationed at the base for rescue and local search and rescue. On 15 September 1965 this detachment was redesignated as Detachment 9, 38th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron. On 16 February 1970 Detachment 9 was moved from Pleiku AB to Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. In mid-1965 Pleiku AB became a forward operating location for 4 AC-47 Spooky gunships of B Flight, 4th Air Commando Squadron. By December 1969 B Flight had been reduced to 2 AC-47s as the aircraft was increasingly phased out of USAF service. In September 1965 the 21st Tactical Air Support Squadron equipped with 30 O-1 Bird Dogs began operating from Pleiku AB. The 633d Combat Support Group was activated at the base on 14 March 1966 taking over the duties of the provisional 6234th Air Base Squadron which had managed construction and other activities at the base after the RVNAF moved to Nha Trang. The A-1 equipped 1st Air Commando Squadron moved to Pleiku on 1 January 1966 from Bien Hoa Air Base where it had operated as part of Farm Gate. The 1st Air Commando Squadron moved to Nakhon Phanom RTAFB in early 1967. During 1966 USAF personnel assigned to the base increased from 150 to over 2500. In September 13 barracks housing 900 men were completed and in October a further 10 barracks were completed. The 9th Air Commando Squadron was activated at Pleiku on 25 January 1967 flying special operations missions using modified C-47s and O-2B Skymasters. During its active service, the 9th ACS flew combat missions, including air support for ground forces, air cover for transports, day and night interdiction, combat search and rescue support, armed reconnaissance, and forward air control. The squadron relocated to Nha Trang Air Base on 1 November 1967. In late October 1967, some of the 604th Air Commando Squadron Combat Dragon A-37A Dragonflys moved to the base from Bien Hoa AB to perform armed and visual reconnaissance missions and night interdiction flights in the Tiger Hound operational area over southeastern Laos. From 1968 to 27 June 1972 the 362d Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron flying specially-equipped EC-47s were assigned to Pleiku. These aircraft were equipped with various electronic warfare components. =633d Special Operations Wing= The 633rd Special Operations Wing was activated at Pleiku on 15 July 1968. Its mission was to provide close air support, day and night interdiction, and visual and photo reconnaissance. The only unit assigned to the 633d Special Operations Wing was the 6th Special Operations Squadron equipped with 20 A-1E/H which deployed to Pleiku on 29 February 1968. During the stay at Pleiku, the squadron maintained a forward SAR alert unit at Da Nang Air Base from 1 April 1968 – 1 September 1969. The squadron was inactivated in place on 15 November 1969. With the departure of its personnel in late 1969, a small group remained at Pleiku for a short period of time to advise the RVNAF. The 633d Wing inactivated on 15 March 1970. For its actions at Pleiku Air Base, the wing was awarded the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award – with Combat \\"V\\" Device and the Republic Of Vietnam Gallantry Cross – with Palm. On 19 May 1970 a PAVN rocket attack on the base destroyed 1 EC-47 and damaged 2 more. Another rocket attack on 26 May damaged 2 more EC-47s. RVNAF at Pleiku In March 1970 the USAF began handing the base over to the RVNAF and this transfer was completed by the end of 1970. Pleiku AB was one of the 2 operating bases of the RVNAF 6th Air Division, the other being Phù Cát Air Base. The RVNAF established the 72d Tactical Wing at the base with the 530th Fighter Squadron equipped with A-1 Skyraiders, along with two UH-1H helicopter assault squadrons (229th, 235th) and the 118th Liaison Squadron, with Cessna O-2A, U-17 forward air controller/light reconnaissance aircraft. The RVNAF 817th Combat Squadron equipped with AC-47s deployed alert aircraft to the base. After the 1973 Paris Peace Accords, Pleiku AB became a center of reconnaissance in the Central Highlands, with the RVNAF monitoring PAVN activity and treaty violations. In 1974, the RVNAF had the following units assigned to Pleiku Air Base: * 6th Air Division (Headquarters) * 72d Tactical Wing : 118th Liaison Squadron Cessna O-2A,U-17 : 530th Fighter Squadron A-1 : 229th/235th Helicopter Squadron Bell UH-1H : Det B 259th Helicopter Squadron Bell UH-1H (Medevac) =Capture of Pleiku Air Base= By the early spring of 1975 North Vietnam realized the time was right to achieve its goal of re- uniting Vietnam under communist rule, and so launched a series of small ground attacks to test U.S. reaction. When these attacks failed to draw a military response from Washington, the PAVN staged an attack on Ban Me Thuot in the Central Highlands. Ban Me Thuot controlled Highways 14 and 21, vital lines of communication from the southern Central Highlands to Saigon and the coast. On the night of 9 March 1975, the PAVN struck the city and Pleiku airfield with artillery, mortars, and rockets. By the next afternoon, over half of Ban Me Thuot was in enemy hands, despite fierce resistance from ARVN defenders. RVNAF air strikes destroyed five PAVN tanks but during one strike, a bomb accidentally hit ARVN sector headquarters severely disrupting communications. At Pleiku airfield, the small ARVN garrison came under attack and was forced to defend the control tower, preventing attempts to fly in reinforcements. ARVN reinforcements were diverted to Buon Ho, north of the city, far from the battle. On the airfield, the PAVN had destroyed an O-1, a CH-47, and ten UH-1s, although three damaged UH-1s had managed to escape. Fierce fighting continued for three more days but by 14 March the situation was hopeless. During the four-day battle the RVNAF flew over 200 sorties, inflicting heavy losses on the PAVN, but to no avail. No aircraft were lost in the air, but three A-37s at Pleiku were destroyed by 122 mm rockets on 11 March when the PAVN rocketed the airfield. The day Ban Me Thuot fell, President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu called an emergency high level meeting at Cam Ranh Bay. During this meeting Thieu made the decision to attempt an orderly withdrawal from the Central Highlands around Kontum and Pleiku in order to conserve forces and regroup for a counter-attack. Unfortunately for the South Vietnamese, the commander of the region, General Phạm Văn Phú, misinterpreted this order and directed an immediately evacuation of both cities. The commander of the 6th Air Division at Pleiku, BG Pham Ngoc Sang was given forty-eight hours to evacuate the airfield and immediately requested UH-1s, CH-47s, and C-130s to fly RVNAF personnel and their dependants out of Pleiku. On 16 March artillery fire began hitting the city and ARVN troops began a retreat to the coast along Highway 7B. At Pleiku airfield sixty-four aircraft were abandoned with little effort to destroy them before evacuating and large quantities of fuel and ordnance were left behind undamaged and ready for the PAVN to use. Current use After the seizure of the base by the PAVN in 1975, the captured RVNAF aircraft were either destroyed or flown out to other airfields and Pleiku Air Base was abandoned, apparently remaining so for many years. Today, a small airport terminal building has been erected on the pad of one of the former USAF hangars. The former base facility has been torn down and a few streets remain, the land now being used for agriculture; none of the former base buildings remain. The large aircraft parking ramp remains but is largely abandoned, along with the jet taxiway which is unused. The former USAF control tower and large fire department building on the flightline remains standing; their current use is undetermined.

Located at the Río de la Plata's mouth on the Argentine Sea, it begins about southeast of Buenos Aires and is about wide. Toponymy The bay is thought to have been named in 1520 by members of Ferdinand Magellan's expedition, who attributed its nearly semicircular shape to the detachment of legendary Saint Brendan's Island from the South American mainland (\\"Samborombón\\" being a corruption of San Borondón). The Samborombón River and the town of Samborombón share the bay's name. Geography Samborombón Bay is located at the mouth of the Río de la Plata, stretching from Punta Piedras in the north to Punta Rasa in the south, where Cape San Antonio begins. Depending on the boundaries used, the bay can be considered an estuary stretch of the Río de la Plata or a large bay of the Argentine Sea; the International Hydrographic Organization defines the eastern boundary of the Río de la Plata as \\"a line joining Punta del Este, Uruguay and Cabo San Antonio, Argentina,\\" a definition which includes Samborombón Bay as part of the river. Hydrology The bay receives inflow from the Southern Salado River, the Samborombón River, and other smaller streams, as well as numerous artificial canals constructed to drain eastern Buenos Aires Province. It also experiences a substantial flow of water coming out from the Río de la Plata into the Argentine Sea. Conservation Samborombón Bay exhibits an unusually high density of shorebird species, many of which use the bay as a stopping point in their seasonal migrations. It also serves as an important nursery habitat for fish species in the Río de la Plata estuary system. The bay and the adjoining coastal region are included in a number of protected areas because of the well preserved Pampas grassland and wetland ecosystems that characterize the area. The Province of Buenos Aires' Provincial Body for Sustainable Development has designated the central portion of the coast as the Samborombón Bay Provincial Nature Reserve because of its importance as a wildlife refuge; parts of the southern coast are included in the Rincón de Ajó Provincial Nature Reserve. The bay is also designated as a Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network Site of International Importance, as well as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance, reflecting its significance as a habitat for the buff-breasted sandpiper and other threatened species. The southern shore includes Campos del Tuyú National Park, home to a population of rare Pampas deer. Recreation The Samborombón Bay coast is known for its excellent sport fishing, particularly in the waters near Punta Rasa and the town of General Lavalle, where large saltwater species such as black drum are abundant.

In 1902-1903, Pokrovsky was a deputy chairman (chairman from 1904) of the Department of Taxation of the Ministry of Finance. In 1906, he was appointed deputy finance minister and mainly oversaw taxation affairs.

From January to November 1916, Pokrovsky held the post of state inspector. =Minister of Foreign Affairs= On 30 November 1916 (N.S) he was appointed minister of foreign affairs. He succeeded Boris Stürmer, in favour of a peace treaty with Germany, and took over the office from Stürmer's deputy Anatoly Neratov. Some of the English newspapers regarded his nomination as a sign of final suppression of Germanophilic agitation in Russia; a defeat for Rasputin and his friends. On his first speech in the Duma on 2 December Pokrovsky announced in the Imperial Duma that the treaty of 1915 with Great Britain and France (later signed by Italy, as well) had finally established Russia’s right on the straits and Constantinople.http://www.hrono.ru/biograf/bio_p/pokrovski_nn.php On 12 December the German Chancellor, Bethmann-Hollweg, in a speech in the Reichstag, offered to open negotiations with the Entente in a neutral country.http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5544246 On 15 December https://www.questia.com/read/3552177/official-statements-of-war-aims-and- peace-proposals Pokrovsky said that Russia would never sign a peace treaty with the Central Powers,https://archive.org/stream/officialcommunic00carn/officialcommunic00carn_djvu.txt which caused a storm of applause in the Duma.On 20 December, before the Entente had replied to Bethmann-Hollweg's suggestion for negotiations, Wilson asked each of the powers to formulate its own peace conditions. On 25 December the Tsar rejected Wilson's note. The Central Powers replied on 26 December by virtually repeating their earlier offer. The Allies condemned the first German offer in a note to the USA on 30 December. Pokrovsky favored the attraction of the American financial capital into the Russian economy. With the support of the Ministry of Finance, he proposed to send a special commission on economic and financial affairs to the United States. In January 1917, Pokrovsky prepared a document, in which he defended the idea of establishing close ties with the US in light of this country’s potentially decisive role in ending the war. In his note to the Tsar from 21 February Pokrovsky expressed his confidence in victory over Germany and inquired about a possibility to prepare an expeditionary force for deployment in Constantinople by October 1917. During a session of the Council of Ministers on 25 February 1917, Pokrovsky proposed the resignation of the whole government. He was sent to negotiate this matter with the Duma and Progressive Bloc. On 26 February Pokrovsky reported about his negotiations with the Bloc (led by Vasili Maklakov) at the session of the Council of Ministers in the Mariinsky Palace. The Bloc spoke for the resignation of the government. After the February Revolution, Pokrovsky headed the Russo-American Committee on Assistance to the Economic Rapprochement between Russia and the US. After the October Revolution, Pokrovsky emigrated from Russia and taught at the Vytautas Magnus University in Kaunas, Lithuania, where he died in 1930.

It is located north- northwest of Phan Rang – Tháp Chàm in Ninh Thuận Province. Initially built by the Imperial Japanese Army about 1942, the airfield was also used by the French Air Force () during the First Indochina War then abandoned in 1954. The United States rebuilt the airfield in 1965 and it was used by the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) and the United States Air Force during the Vietnam War in the II Corps Tactical Zone of South Vietnam. It was seized by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) in April 1975 and has been in use by the VPAF ever since. Origins The airfield at Phan Rang was used by the Japanese during World War II. In the late 1940s and early 1950s the French Air Force used the same runway, and abandoned the facility when French control over Indochina ended in 1954. USAF use during the Vietnam War =1965-6 Reconstruction= In April 1965 CINCPAC instructed an engineering survey for a new airfield at Phan Rang. In July 1965 it was planned that 3 fighter squadrons would be deployed to Phan Rang Air Base once it was completed in October. In late-August 1965 the newly arrived US Army 62nd Engineer Battalion (Construction) was ordered to build a jet-capable airfield at Phan Rang. Commencing construction in September the Army Engineers built a AM-2 aluminum matting runway and open aircraft revetments. Bad weather and shortages of concrete, piping and aluminum matting delayed the base construction, with the completion date progressively delayed to December 1965 and then April 1966. With the movement of the 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division to Phan Rang to provide security for base construction the 62nd Engineer Battalion was also required to construct a base for the 1st Brigade. While the 62nd Engineers constructed the temporary runway, American construction consortium RMK-BRJ was working on a permanent concrete runway, taxiways and parking areas. In January 1966 the USAF 554th RED HORSE Squadron arrived at the base to assist with construction. The temporary aluminum runway became operational on 20 February and by mid-March all the interim facilities were operational. Heavy rain in May 1966 and rushed construction led to damage to the aluminum runway and taxiways and in June the 62nd Engineers rebuilt the taxiways while the 554th RED HORSE and RMK-BRJ rebuilt the runway, reducing its available length to . The 62nd Engineers also built a 46,000-barrel fuel storage area, a six-inch pipeline to the beach and two 8-inch submarine pipelines from the beach to an offshore floating mooring and discharge facility. On 12 October 1966 RMK-BMJ completed the concrete runway and 4 connecting taxiways. By the end of the year the base was fully completed with powerplant, water and sewage system, operations, accommodation and other structures. The USAF forces stationed there were under the command of the United States Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) Seventh Air Force. In addition, the United States Navy, and United States Marine Corps had aviation and other support units stationed at Phan Rang. =366th Tactical Fighter Wing= Due to the delays in completion of the base, the F-4C Phantom II equipped 391st Tactical Fighter Squadron was diverted from Phan Rang to Cam Ranh Air Base and the 480th Tactical Fighter Squadron went to Da Nang Air Base. On 14 March 1966 the F-4C equipped 389th Tactical Fighter Squadron arrived at the base becoming the first USAF squadron to deploy there. On 20 March 1966 the 366th Tactical Fighter Wing was the first permanent USAF organization to be stationed at Phan Rang Air Base. The rain damage to the base in May 1966 delayed the deployment of the 391st Tactical Fighter Squadron from Cam Ranh AB and the 480th TFS from Da Nang AB. The squadrons assigned to the 366th TFW during this period were: * 352d Tactical Fighter Squadron: from 15 August 1966 (F-100D/F Super Sabre) * 389th Tactical Fighter Squadron * Detachment 1, 612th Tactical Fighter Squadron: from 15 May 1966 (F-100) * 614th Tactical Fighter Squadron: from 18 September 1966 (F-100D/F) * 615th Tactical Fighter Squadron: from 16 July 1966(F-100D/F) The US population at the base increased dramatically from 118 in March 1966 to over 4,500 in September 1966. This increase led to pressure on accommodation and maintenance facilities which were still under construction; the growth of prostitution in the \\"sin strip\\" outside the base; and an increase in employment of Vietnamese on the base, growing to 1000 by the end of 1966. On 10 October 1966, the 366th TFW and the 389th Tactical Fighter Squadron moved to Da Nang AB and the 35th Tactical Fighter Wing at Da Nang AB moved to Phan Rang. =35th Tactical Fighter Wing= F-100F Super Sabre of the 352d Tactical Fighter Squadron at Phan Rang, 1971 On 10 October 1966 the 35th Tactical Fighter Wing took over as the host unit at Phan Rang. Units assigned to the 35th TFW were: * 120th Tactical Fighter Squadron: 30 April 1968 – 18 April 1969 (F-100C/F Tail Code: VS) * 352d Tactical Fighter Squadron: 10 October 1966 – 31 July 1971 (F-100D/F Tail Code: VM) * 612th Tactical Fighter Squadron: 10 October 1966 – 8 January 1967 and 14 April 1969 – 15 March 1971 (F-100D/F Tail Code: VS) * 614th Tactical Fighter Squadron: 10 October 1966 – 31 July 1971 (F-100D/F Tail Code: VP) * 615th Tactical Fighter Squadron: 10 October 1966 – 31 July 1971 (F-100D/F Tail Code: VZ) Missions included air support of ground forces, interdiction, visual and armed reconnaissance, strike assessment photography, escort, close and direct air support, and rapid reaction alert.

B-57 units assigned to the 35th TFWA at Phan Rang were as follows: * 8th Tactical Bombardment Squadron: 12 October 1966 – 15 November 1969 (B-57B/C/E Tail Code: PQ) * 13th Tactical Bombardment Squadron: 12 October 1966 – 15 January 1968 (B-57B/C/E Tail Code: PV) * 2 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force: 19 April 1967 – 4 June 1971 (Canberra B.20) On 24 December 1966, 3 Operation Tropic Moon II B-57s, experimentally fitted with a low light level television system carried in a pod underneath the port wing arrived at Phan Rang. By November 1969 the 8th Bombardment Squadron's strength was down to only 9 aircraft, and it was decided that it was time to retire the B-57B from active service. The surviving aircraft were sent back to the United States in September and October and the 8th Bombardment Squadron was moved to Bien Hoa Air Base and redesignated the 8th Special Operations Squadron. The RAAF Canberras continued operations from Phan Rang AB until they were withdrawn in June 1971. Further developments, deployments and attacks Detachment 1, 38th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron equipped with HH-43 Huskies relocated to the base from Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base. In November 1967 Phan Rang became a forward operating location for 4 AC-47 Spooky gunships of the newly-activated 14th Air Commando Squadron. On 31 January 1968 at the start of the Tet Offensive, naval gunfire from was used to deter a VC attack on the base and gunfire from the later deterred a similar attack. On 15 April 1968 the 550-man 821st Combat Security Police Squadron was deployed to the base on temporary duty, they were replaced by the 822nd Combat Security Police Squadron in August 1968. The 822nd was replaced by the 823rd Combat Security Police Squadron in March 1969 and was then replaced by the 821st in August 1969. The 821st remained at Phan Rang until February 1971 when it was inactivated. In mid-September 1968 the Federalized Utah National Guard 116th Engineer Combat Battalion deployed to Phan Rang Air Base to begin a ten-month tour of duty. Between 10 August 1968 and 31 May 1969, the 554th Civil Engineering Squadron built an armament and electronics shop, fire station, a concrete access taxiway, 6 troop barracks and 2 officers quarters protecting by a revetment wall, a 49,000-square-yard asphalt hardstand, and a base theater. Commencing in October 1968, USAF engineers built 61 \\"Wonderarch\\" aircraft shelters at Phan Rang. On 3 May 1970 VC sappers attacked the base but were repulsed with minor damage and no Allied casualties. On 10 September VC attacked the main gate but were also repulsed with little damage and no Allied casualties. =315th Air Commando Wing/Special Operations Wing= C-123K of the 19th Air Commando Squadron at Phan Rang, April 1968 The 315th Air Commando Wing (Troop Carrier) moved to Phan Rang from Tan Son Nhut Air Base on 15 June 1967 and became a tenant unit supported by the 35th Combat Support Group. Initially designated as the 315th Air Commando Wing, it was redesignated the 315th Special Operations Wing on 1 August 1968. Squadrons assigned were: * 12th Special Operations Squadron: 15 June 1967 – 30 September 1970 (C-123B/K) * 19th Special Operations Squadron: 15 June 1967 – 30 June 1971 (C-123B/K Tail Code: WE) * 309th Special Operations Squadron: 15 June 1967 – 31 July 1970 (C-123B/K Tail Code: WH) * 310th Special Operations Squadron: 15 June 1967 – 15 January 1972 (C-123B/K Tail Code: WM) * 311th Special Operations Squadron: 15 June 1967 – 15 October 1971 (C-123B/K Tail Code: WV) Operations included aerial movement of troops and cargo, flare drops, aeromedical evacuation, and air-drops of critical supplies and paratroops. In 1971–1972 the unit helped to train C-123 aircrews for the RVNAF. The wing was redesignated as the 315th Tactical Airlift Wing on 1 January 1970 and was inactivated on 31 March 1972. Counter-insurgency aircraft A-37B of the 8th Special Operations Squadron, 1970 In 1971 the 315th TAW expanded its mission with the control of the interdiction and the psychological warfare and visual reconnaissance operations of the following counter-insurgency squadrons: * 8th Special Operations Squadron: 31 July 1971 – 15 January 1972 (A-37B Dragonfly Tail Code: CG) * 9th Special Operations Squadron: 30 September 1971 – 29 February 1972 (O-2 Skymaster) On 15 January 1972, the 8th Special Operations Squadron was reassigned to Bien Hoa AB as part of the USAF drawdown at Phan Rang. The 9th SOS was inactivated on 29 February 1972. =14th Special Operations Wing= AC-119G \\"Shadow\\" gunship of the 17th Special Operations Squadron, 1969 AC-47B \\"Spooky\\" gunship of the 4th Special Operations Squadron, March 1969 The 14th Special Operations Wing operated from Phan Rang from 15 October 1969, transferring operational squadrons from Nha Trang Air Base and became a tenant unit supported by the 35th Combat Support Group. The 14th SOW's operations included close and direct air support, interdiction, unconventional warfare, counter-insurgency operations, psychological warfare (including leaflet dropping and aerial broadcasting) and flare drops. Squadrons assigned were: * 4th Special Operations Squadron: 15 October 1969 – 15 December 1969 (AC-47D Spooky) * 9th Special Operations Squadron: 15 October 1969 – 30 September 1971 (C-47) * 15th Special Operations Squadron: 15 October 1969 – 31 October 1970 (C-130E Combat Talon) * 17th Special Operations Squadron: 15 October 1969 – 30 September 1971 (AC-119G Shadow) * 18th Special Operations Squadron: 15 October 1969 – 25 August 1971 (AC-119K Stinger) * 20th Special Operations Squadron: 15 October 1969 – 1 September 1971 (UH-1P) * 90th Special Operations Squadron: 31 October 1970 – 1 September 1971 (AC-123K) * 604th Special Operations Squadron (detached): 15 October 1969 - I March 1970 (A-37A) Flying from Phan Rang sorties were flown over target areas consisting of the Mekong Delta and the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The aerial gunships destroyed trucks, attacked enemy encampments, ammunition dumps and other ground targets using night vision equipment. It also trained RVNAF personnel in AC-119 operations and maintenance, from February to June 1971. The first crews graduated in April 1971 and with AC-119s transferred to the RVNAF formed the 819th Combat Squadron. =USAF withdrawal= The 35th TFW was inactivated on 31 July 1971 as part of the general drawdown of United States forces in South Vietnam with the wing's remaining resources passing to the 315th Tactical Airlift Wing. The 352d TFS and the 615th TFS were inactivated in place along with the 35th TFW, standing down from operations on 26 June 1971. The 612th TFS and 614th TFS were inactivated in place on 31 July 1971. The 315th TAW inactivated in place on 30 September 1971 as part of the US withdrawal from South Vietnam, and jurisdiction of Phan Rang Air Base was turned over to the South Vietnamese. RVNAF use of Phan Rang Air Base A-37B of the RVNAF 548th Fighter Squadron The base was progressively handed over to the RVNAF in March-May 1972. After the American withdrawal the RVNAF 92d Tactical Wing at Nha Trang AB moved to Phan Rang Air, operating A-37s and UH-1 helicopters. In addition to the operational missions, the RVNAF 920th Training Squadron operated T-37Bs for initial jet training for its aviation cadets. American policy in Vietnam after 1970 was aimed at self-sufficiency for the RVNAF so the South Vietnamese could maintain the level of security that had been won jointly by the United States and South Vietnam. The United States would continue to provide material support for the defense of South Vietnam, but it was expected that the RVNAF would have the capability to use United States equipment effectively. If that capability could be developed, the RVNAF would be judged self-sufficient. However, this training had to be halted in June 1974 for lack of logistic support and financial reasons due to United States aid reduction. Units at Phan Rang Air Base were under the command of the RVNAF 2d Air Division at Nha Trang AB. 92d Tactical Wing * 524th/534th/548th Fighter Squadron A-37 * Det D 259th Helicopter Squadron UH-1H (Medevac) On 15 September 1974 a hijacker took control of an Air Vietnam Boeing 727-121C on a flight from Da Nang to Saigon and demanded to be flown to Hanoi. The crew attempted to land at the base, overshot the landing and then crashed while turning to make another approach killing all 75 onboard. =Capture of Phan Rang Air Base= Following the defeat of Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces in the Central Highlands in mid-March 1975, People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) forces pursued the ARVN to the coast, capturing Nha Trang and Nha Trang AB on 2 April, however most of the flyable aircraft of the RVNAF 2nd Air Division had already moved south to Phan Rang AB. On 1 April crowds of ARVN and civilians began descending on the base from Nha Trang and Cam Ranh seeking evacuation to Saigon. That night the ARVN 3rd Airborne Brigade arrived on trucks at Phan Rang AB having retreated from the M'Đrăk Pass and it proceeded to deploy around the base and clear away VC around the base perimeter. On 2 April the 2nd Air Division commander BG Nguyễn Văn Lương left Phan Rang in his C-47 to go for meetings at Tan Son Nhut setting off panic among the RVNAF and ARVN forces at the base who believed he was abandoning them and leading to a chaos as panicked South Vietnamese swarmed aircraft that departed haphazardly for bases further south. Two RAAF C-130s landed at the base to evacuate civilians and were mobbed as they tried to leave. Order was eventually restored by the 3rd Airborne Brigade as the refugees were evacuated. On the morning of 3 April 1975 the RVNAF at Phan Rang launched a heliborne operation comprising more than 40 UH-1s and 6 CH-47s escorted by A-37s to rescue the remnants of the ARVN 2nd, 5th and 6th Airborne Battalions that had been cut off at the M'Đrăk Pass successfully evacuating over 800 soldiers. That day the PAVN 10th Division captured Cam Ranh Bay and Cam Ranh Air Base north of Phan Rang. The approached Phan Rang and over the next 2 days picked up over 3500 South Vietnamese refugees. Also that day 6th Air Division commander BG Pham Ngoc Sang met with the III Corps commander LG Nguyễn Văn Toàn at Phan Thiết and Sang was given responsibility for holding Phan Rang. On 4 April the 2 remaining provinces of II Corps were incorporated into II Corps and LG Nguyễn Vĩnh Nghi arrived at Phan Rang to take over the defense of the area from BG Sang. The Phan Rang A-37s continued to operate under difficult conditions with ground crews being forced to service aircraft in Flak jackets due to rocket and mortar fire on the base and intermittent supplies after Highway 1 was cut off east of Xuân Lộc. Half of the wing was rotated daily to Tan Son Nhut for servicing, resupply and crew rest. From 7 to 8 April the 2nd Airborne Brigade flew into Phan Rang to replace the 3rd Airborne Brigade which moved back to Saigon. On 8 April the 3rd Airborne Battalion cleared Highway 1 and recaptured the villages of Bà Râu () and Ba Thap () from the VC and the 11th Airborne Battalion then deployed by helicopters to recapture Du Long town () and the Du Long Pass (), meanwhile the 5th Airborne Battalion secured the area around Phan Rang AB and cleared Route 11. On 10 April the PAVN 10th Division left Cam Ranh and moved along Route 450 to join up with Route 11 to take Dalat, passing within of Phan Rang AB. When RVNAF reconnaissance aircraft observed the movement of the 10th Division, Phan Rang based A-37s began attacking the column, destroying 6 river-crossing vehicles on 10 April, 5 trucks on 11 April, 7 trucks on 12 April and 9 trucks on 13 April. On 11 April the 5th Airborne Battalion was withdrawn to Saigon and on 12 April the rest of the 2nd Airborne Brigade was ordered to withdraw to Saigon. On 13 April the 31st Rangers arrived by air from Bien Hoa while the ARVN 4th and 5th Regiments, 2nd Division arrived by road from Phan Thiết to replace the Airborne. The 31st Rangers deployed to Du Long to replace the 11th Airborne Battalion on the evening of 13 April. The PAVN meanwhile had decided to eliminate Phan Rang and at 05:30 on 14 April the PAVN 3rd Division began an artillery attack on the 31st Rangers at Du Long Pass and the 3rd Airborne at Bà Râu. At 06:30 PAVN tanks and infantry attacked to 31st Rangers' position but were forced back. At 07:00 2 A-37s accidentally bombed the Rangers. The PAVN then bypassed the Rangers and attacked Du Long Town quickly defeating the Regional Forces there and outflanking the 31st Rangers at the pass. Reinforcements from the 52nd Rangers were sent to support the 31st Rangers, but they were unable to break through and at 16:00 the 31st Rangers were ordered to withdraw with only 80 Rangers successfully returning to Phan Rang AB. At the same time as the attack on Du Long, the PAVN 25th Regiment infiltrated to attack Phan Rang AB. Despite helicopter gunship fire they successfully penetrated the base and headed for the hangar area where they were met by the 11th Airborne Battalion awaiting transport back to Saigon and 4 M113 armored personnel carriers which together with air support from the helicopter gunships and A-37s forced the PAVN back outside the perimeter, killing over 100 for the loss of 6 ARVN killed and 1 M113 destroyed. At dawn on 15 April the PAVN shelled the 3rd Airborne Battalion at Bà Râu and Kien Kien () on Route 1 and then attacked their position. Although outnumbered, the Airborne held back the assault until midday when it blew the highway bridge and then withdrew onto Ca Dau mountain to the east. At 02:00 on 16 April an RVNAF EC-47 intercepted a PAVN radio transmission indicating an armored attack on Phan Rang would start at 05:00. A-37 aircraft were launched to attack PAVN positions along Route 1 and at 03:00 reconnaissance reported a large PAVN force moving through the Du Long Pass. Meanwhile VC forces began attacking the base perimeter and on Ca Dau Mountain. At 05:00 the PAVN artillery bombardment commenced and this was soon followed by an armored spearhead of 20 tanks and armored personnel carriers of the 4th Battalion, 203rd Tank Brigade supported by truck mounted infantry of the 101st Regiment and anti-aircraft guns. While the lead tank was destroyed by an ARVN rocket, the PAVN force quickly cut through the 3rd Airborne platoon holding Kien Kien. The RVNAF at the base mounted numerous airstrikes on the armored column destroying vehicles, taking losses from the antiaircraft fire and by 08:00 the armored vehicles were on the outskirts of the city. However the truck-mounted infantry had dispersed to avoid the airstrikes and the anti- aircraft vehicles had not kept up with the advance, leaving the 101st Regiment vulnerable to further air attacks which destroyed or damaged another 16 vehicles and killing numerous PAVN soldiers. The PAVN 3rd Division then attacked the Airborne troops on Ca Dau Mountain and allowed the 101st Regiment to resume its advance. After overcoming a Regional Force roadblock on the outskirts of the city for the loss of 2 tanks and many infantry, the PAVN pushed into the city capturing the Provincial Headquarters. By 09:30 the PAVN had captured the port and a bridge on Route 1 south of the city sealing off all sea and land escape routes. At 08:45 a battalion-sized PAVN mechanized force attacked along Route 11 towards the base. While one element attacked the 5th Regiment defending Route 11, the other moved around it to attack the base directly and at the same time the 25th Regiment attacked the north of the base. The 5th Regiment soon broke and ran allowing the PAVN to attack the base's main gate, while the 25th Regiment penetrated the north perimeter with explosives and captured the bomb storage area. The Airborne attempted a counterattack against the 25th Regiment, but were forced back and then squeezed between the PAVN and by 09:30 the PAVN had captured the base. LG Nghi ordered his remaining forces to retreat from the base to the Ca Na peninsula () south of the base and after cutting through the perimeter fence a large group of RVNAF, ARVN and South Vietnamese civilians fled the base joining up with the 11th Airborne outside the base. At midnight on 17 April the ARVN Airborne attacked a PAVN force on Route 11, but in the confusion of the attack LG Nghi, his command group and CIA Agent James Lewis became separated and at 02:00 were captured by the PAVN. As the base was falling an A-37 braved the PAVN fire and landed rescuing RVNAF 92nd Wing commander Colonel Le Van Thao. Of the Wing's 72 A-37s, only 24 escaped on 16 April with the rest having been shot down or abandoned. Post 1975 VPAF use With its capture, Phan Rang Air Base became a VPAF base. It is unclear to what extent the former USAF facilities were used, although aerial imagery shows that a large amount of the station was torn down over the years, the large base simply being too big for the VPAF, in addition the 04R/22L runway was inactivated, and today is almost obliterated. A few of the hangars remain standing, others have been torn down. The large aircraft parking ramp and concrete aircraft shelters remain, although the shelters appear to have been left unused. Steel and sand revetments also remain on the ramp. The captured aircraft at Phan Rang AB were later used by the VPAF in missions during the Cambodian–Vietnamese War. The A-37s flew most of the ground support missions in those conflicts, being more suited to the role than the VPAF's MiG-17s and MiG-21s. Several squadrons of captured UH-1H Hueys were also operated by the VPAF for many years from Phan Rang. The base is now used by the VPAF 937th Fighter Regiment equipped with Sukhoi Su-30MK2Vs, Sukhoi Su-27SK and Su-27UBK fighters.

The joint Polish and Lithuanian forces, under command of King Władysław II Jagiełło and Grand Duke Vytautas, besieged the castle between 26 July and 19 September 1410 in a bid of complete conquest of Prussia after the great victory in the Battle of Grunwald (Tannenberg). However, the castle withstood the siege and the Knights conceded only to minor territorial losses in the Peace of Thorn (1411). Marienburg defender Heinrich von Plauen is credited as the savior of the Knights from complete annihilation. Background Allied Polish and Lithuanian forces invaded Prussia in July 1410 with a goal of capturing Marienburg. Their path was blocked by the Teutonic Knights, who engaged the allied forces in the decisive Battle of Grunwald on 15 July 1410. The Knights suffered a great defeat, leaving most of their leadership dead or captured. The victorious Polish and Lithuanian forces stayed on the battlefield for three days; during this time Heinrich von Plauen, Komtur of Schwetz (Świecie), organized defense of Marienburg. Von Plauen did not participate in the battle and was trusted to command reserve forces of about 3,000 men in Schwetz. It is not entirely clear whether von Plauen marched to Marienburg based on pre-battle instructions of Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen or on his own initiative to fill the leadership void. As the Polish–Lithuanian forces moved on to Marienburg, three Teutonic fortresses – Hohenstein (Olsztynek), Osterode (Ostróda), and Christburg (Dzierzgoń) – surrendered without resistance. The allied forces moved slowly, averaging only about per day, giving time for von Plauen to organize the defense. This delay has been criticized by modern historians as one of the greatest Polish–Lithuanian tactical mistakes and has been a subject of much speculation. Polish historian Paweł Jasienica suggested, for example, that Jagiełło might have intentionally given the Knights time to regroup, to keep the Order humbled but not decimated so as to not upset the balance of power between Poland (which would most likely acquire most of the Order possessions if it was totally defeated) and Lithuania; but a lack of primary sources precludes a definitive explanation. Siege Map of army movements in the Grunwald campaign The main Polish–Lithuanian forces arrived only on 26 July 1410. The day before von Plauen ordered the town outside the Marienburg Castle to be burned, depriving allied soldiers of shelter and clearing the battlefield. The siege was not intense: Polish King Jagiełło was confident that Prussia had already fallen and began distributing land among his nobles. He sent his troops to capture numerous small castles that were left without garrisons. Only eight castles remained in Teutonic hands. The Knights were allowed to communicate with their allies. They sent envoys to Sigismund of Hungary and Wenceslaus, King of the Romans, who provided a loan to hire mercenaries and promised to send Bohemian and Moravian reinforcements by the end of September. The Livonian Order sent 500 men as soon as its three-month truce with Lithuania expired. The siege, holding Jogaila's army in place, helped to organize defensive forces in other parts of Prussia. The besiegers expected capitulation and were not prepared for a long-term engagement, suffering from lack of ammunition, low morale, and an epidemic of dysentery. The nobles wanted to return home for the harvest and the mercenaries wanted to get paid. Lithuanian troops, commanded by Vytautas, were the first to withdraw. The siege was eventually lifted on 19 September. Before departing, Jogaila built a stronghold in Stuhm (Sztum), south of Marienburg, hoping to keep pressure on the Knights. The Polish–Lithuanian forces returned to Poland and Lithuania, leaving Polish garrisons in fortresses that surrendered or were captured. Aftermath After the withdrawal of the Polish–Lithuanian forces, the Knights started taking back their fortresses. By the end of October, only four Teutonic castles remained in Polish hands – border towns of Thorn (Toruń), Nessau (Nieszawa), Rehden (Radzyń Chełmiński) and Strasburg (Brodnica). Jogaila raised a fresh army and dealt another defeat to the Knights in the Battle of Koronowo on 10 October 1410. Von Plauen, using his reputation as hero of Marienburg, was selected as the new Grand Master in November. Von Plauen wanted to continue warfare, but he was pressured by his advisers into peace negotiations. The Peace of Thorn was signed on 1 February 1411. It is considered a diplomatic victory for the Knights as they suffered only minimal territorial losses. The Siege of Marienburg and subsequent Peace of Thorn are seen as disappointing results of the great Battle of Grunwald. The Marienburg Castle was again defended by the Teutonic Order in 1454 but was captured by Poles in 1457 during the subsequent Thirteen Years' War (1454–66).

It was located near the city of Saigon in southern Vietnam. The United States used it as a major base during the Vietnam War (1959–1975), stationing Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine units there. Following the Fall of Saigon, it was taken over as a Vietnam People's Air Force (VPAF) facility and remains in use today. Tan Son Nhat International Airport, (IATA: SGN, ICAO: VVTS) has been a major Vietnamese civil airport since the 1920s. Early history Tan Son Nhat Airport was built by the French in the 1930s when the French Colonial government of Indochina constructed a small unpaved airport, known as Tan Son Nhat Airfield, in the village of Tan Son Nhat to serve as Saigon's commercial airport. Flights to and from France, as well as within Southeast Asia were available prior to World War II. During World War II, the Imperial Japanese Army used Tan Son Nhat as a transport base. When Japan surrendered in August 1945, the French Air Force flew a contingent of 150 troops into Tan Son Nhat. After World War II, Tân Sơn Nhất served domestic as well as international flights from Saigon. In mid-1956 construction of a runway was completed and the International Cooperation Administration soon started work on a concrete runway. The airfield was run by the South Vietnamese Department of Civil Aviation with the RVNAF as a tenant located on the southwest of the airfield. In 1961, the government of the Republic of Vietnam requested the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) to plan for expansion of the Tan Son Nhut airport. A taxiway parallel to the original runway had just been completed by the E.V. Lane company for the U.S. Operations Mission, but parking aprons and connections to the taxiways were required. Under the direction of the U.S. Navy Officer in Charge of Construction RVN, these items were constructed by the American construction company RMK-BRJ in 1962. RMK-BRJ also constructed an air-control radar station in 1962, and the passenger and freight terminals in 1963. In 1967, RMK-BRJ constructed the second 10,000-foot concrete runway. Republic of Vietnam Air Force use Tan Son Nhut Air Base in 1962. The uncrowded flight line reflects the level of USAF/RVNAF activity Douglas DC-6B VIP Transport of the RVNAF 314th Special Missions Squadron RVNAF C-47 Skytrains of the 413th Transportation Squadron on the crowded flightline at Tan Son Nhut along with a Royal Air Force De Havilland Dove and several other aircraft In late 1951, the French Air Force established the RVNAF 312th Special Mission Squadron at Tan Son Nhat Airfield equipped with Morane 500 Criquet liaison aircraft. In 1952 a heliport was constructed at the base for use by French Air Force medical evacuation helicopters. In 1953, Tan Son Nhut started being used as a military air base for the fledgling RVNAF, and in 1956 the headquarters were moved from the center of Saigon to Tan Son Nhut. But even before that time, French and Vietnamese military aircraft were in evidence at Tan Son Nhut. On 1 July 1955, the RVNAF 1st Transport Squadron equipped with C-47 Skytrains was established at the base. The RVNAF also had a special missions squadron at the base equipped with 3 C-47s, 3 C-45s and 1 L-26. The 1st Transport Squadron would be renamed the 413rd Air Transport Squadron in January 1963. In June 1956 the 2nd Transport Squadron equipped with C-47s was established at the base and the RVNAF established its headquarters there. It would be renamed the 415th Air Transport Squadron in January 1963. In November 1956, by agreement with the South Vietnamese government, the USAF assumed some training and administrative roles of the RVNAF. A full handover of training responsibility took place on 1 June 1957 when the French training contracts expired. On 1 June 1957 the RVNAF 1st Helicopter Squadron was established at the base without equipment. It operated with the French Air Force unit serving the International Control Commission and in April 1958 with the departure of the French it inherited its 10 H-19 helicopters. In October 1959 the 2nd Liaison Squadron equipped with L-19 Bird Dogs moved to the base from Nha Trang. In mid-December 1961 the USAF began delivery of 30 T-28 Trojans to the RVNAF at Tan Son Nhut. In December 1962 the 293rd Helicopter Squadron was activated at the base, it was inactivated in August 1964. In late 1962 the RVNAF formed the 716th Composite Reconnaissance Squadron initially equipped with 2 C-45 photo-reconnaissance aircraft. In January 1963 the USAF opened an H-19 pilot training facility at the base and by June the first RVNAF helicopter pilots had graduated. In January 1963 the 211th Helicopter Squadron equipped with UH-34s replaced the 1st Helicopter Squadron. In December 1963 the 716th Composite Reconnaissance Squadron was activated at the base, equipped with C-47s and T-28s. The squadron would be inactivated in June 1964 and its mission assumed by the 2nd Air Division, while its pilots formed the 520th Fighter Squadron at Bien Hoa Air Base. In January 1964 all RVNAF units at the base came under the control of the newly established 33rd Tactical Wing. By midyear, the RVNAF had grown to thirteen squadrons; four fighter, four observation, three helicopter, and two C-47 transport. The RVNAF followed the practice of the U.S. Air Force, organizing the squadrons into wings, with one wing located in each of the four corps tactical zones at Cần Thơ Air Base, Tan Son Nhut AB, Pleiku Air Base and Da Nang Air Base. In May 1965 the Douglas A-1 Skyraider equipped 522nd Fighter Squadron was activated at the base. =Command and control center= As the headquarters for the RVNAF, Tan Son Nhut was primarily a command base, with most operational units using nearby Biên Hòa Air Base. At Tan Son Nhut, the RVNAF's system of command and control was developed over the years with assistance from the USAF. The system handled the flow of aircraft from take- off to target area, and return to the base it was launched from. This was known as the Tactical Air Control System (TACS), and it assured positive control of all areas where significant combat operations were performed. Without this system, it would not have been possible for the RVNAF to deploy its forces effectively where needed. The TACS was in close proximity to the headquarters of the RVNAF and USAF forces in South Vietnam, and commanders of both Air Forces utilized its facilities. Subordinate to TACS was the Direct Air Support Centers (DASC) assigned to each of corps areas (I DASC – Da Nang AB, DASC Alpha – Nha Trang Air Base, II DASC – Pleiku AB, III DASC – Bien Hoa AB, and IV DASC – Cần Thơ AB). DASCs were responsible for the deployment of aircraft located within their sector in support of ground operations. Operating under each DASC were numerous Tactical Air Control Party (TACPs), manned by one or more RVNAF/USAF personnel posted with the South Vietnamese Army (ARVN) ground forces. A communications network inked these three levels of command and control, giving the TACS overall control of the South Vietnamese air situation at all times. Additional information was provided by a radar network that covered all of South Vietnam and beyond, monitoring all strike aircraft. Another function of Tan Son Nhut Air Base was as an RVNAF recruiting center. =Use in coups= The base was adjacent to the headquarters of the Joint General Staff of South Vietnam, and was a key venue in various military coups, particularly the 1963 coup that deposed the nation's first President Ngô Đình Diệm. The plotters invited loyalist officers to a routine lunch meeting at JGS and captured them in the afternoon of 1 November 1963. The most notable was Colonel Lê Quang Tung, loyalist commander of the ARVN Special Forces, which was effectively a private Ngô family army, and his brother and deputy, Le Quảng Trịeu. Later, Captain Nguyễn Văn Nhung, bodyguard of coup leader General Dương Văn Minh, shot the brothers on the edge of the base. On 14 April 1966 a Viet Cong (VC) mortar attack on the base destroyed 2 RVNAF aircraft and killed 7 USAF and 2 RVNAF personnel. The base was attacked by the VC in a sapper and mortar attack on the morning of 4 December 1966. The attack was repulsed for the loss of 3 US and 3 ARVN killed and 28 VC killed and 4 captured. RVNAF Women's Armed Forces Corps (WAFC) personnel with USAF adviser Captain Mary A. Marsh, June 1968 =1968 Tet Offensive= United States Air Force Security Police in combat at Tan Son Nhut during the 1968 Tet Offensive Viet Cong killed during the attack on Tan Son Nhut Air Base during the Tet Offensive The base was the target of major VC attacks during the 1968 Tet Offensive. The attack began early on 31 January with greater severity than anyone had expected. When the VC attacked much of the RVNAF was on leave to be with their families during the lunar new year. An immediate recall was issued, and within 72 hours, 90 percent of the RVNAF was on duty. The main VC attack was made against the western perimeter of the base by 3 VC Battalions. The initial penetration was contained by the base's 377th Security Police Squadron, ad-hoc Army units of Task Force 35, ad-hoc RVNAF units and two ARVN Airborne battalions. The 3rd Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment was sent from Củ Chi Base Camp and prevented follow-on forces west of the base from reinforcing the VC inside the base and engaged them in a village and factory west of the base. By 16:30 on 31 January the base was secured. U.S. losses were 22 killed and 82 wounded, ARVN losses 29 killed and 15 wounded, VC losses were more than 669 killed and 26 captured. 14 aircraft were damaged at the base. Over the next three weeks, the RVNAF flew over 1,300 strike sorties, bombing and strafing PAVN/VC positions throughout South Vietnam. Transport aircraft from Tan Son Nhut's 33d Wing dropped almost 15,000 flares in 12 nights, compared with a normal monthly average of 10,000. Observation aircraft also from Tan Son Nhut completed almost 700 reconnaissance sorties, with RVNAF pilots flying O-1 Bird Dogs and U-17 Skywagons. F-4 Phantom II destroyed during a rocket attack on 18 February 1968 At 01:15 on 18 February a VC rocket and mortar attack on the base destroyed 6 aircraft and damaged 33 others and killed one person. A rocket attack the next day hit the civilian air terminal killing 1 person and 6 further rocket/mortar attacks over this period killed another 6 people and wounded 151. On 24 February another rocket and mortar attack damaged base buildings killing 4 US personnel and wounding 21. On 12 June 1968 a mortar attack on the base destroyed 2 USAF aircraft and killed 1 airman. The Tet Offensive attacks and previous losses due to mortar and rocket attacks on air bases across South Vietnam led the Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Nitze on 6 March 1968 to approve the construction of 165 \\"Wonderarch\\" roofed aircraft shelters at the major air bases. In addition airborne \\"rocket watch\\" patrols were established in the Saigon-Biên Hòa area to reduce attacks by fire. =Vietnamization and the 1972 Easter Offensive= C-119Gs of the RVNAF 819th Transport Squadron On 2 July 1969 the first 5 AC-47 Spooky gunships were handed over to the RVNAF to form the 817th Combat Squadron which became operational at the base on 31 August. In 1970, with American units leaving the country, the RVNAF transport fleet was greatly increased at Tan Son Nhut. The RVNAF 33rd and 53rd Tactical Wings were established flying C-123 Providers, C-47s and C-7 Caribous. In mid 1970 the USAF began training RVNAF crews on the AC-119G Shadow gunship at the base. Other courses included navigation classes and helicopter transition and maintenance training for the CH-47 Chinook. By November 1970, the RVNAF took total control of the Direct Air Support Centers (DASCs) at Bien Hoa AB, Da Nang AB and Pleiku AB. At the end of 1971, the RVNAF were totally in control of command and control units at eight major air bases, supporting ARVN units for the expanded air-ground operations system. In September 1971, the USAF transferred two C-119 squadrons to the RVNAF at Tan Son Nhut. In 1972, the buildup of the RVNAF at Tan Son Nhut was expanded when two C-130 Hercules squadrons were formed there. In December, the first RVNAF C-130 training facility was established at Tan Son Nhut, enabling the RVNAF to train its own C-130s pilots. As more C-130s were transferred to the RVNAF, older C-123s were returned to the USAF for disposal. As the buildup of the RVNAF continued, the success of the Vietnamization program was evident during the 1972 Easter Offensive. Responding to the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) attack, the RVNAF flew more than 20,000 strike sorties which helped to stem the advance. In the first month of the offensive, transports from Tan Son Nhut ferried thousands of troops and delivered nearly 4,000 tons of supplies throughout the country. The offensive also resulted in additional deliveries of aircraft to the RVNAF under Operation Enhance. Also, fighter aircraft arrived at Tan Son Nhut for the first time in the F-5A/B Freedom Fighter and the F-5E Tiger II. The F-5s were subsequently transferred to Bien Hoa and Da Nang ABs. =1973 Ceasefire= RVNAF C-123 55-4565 assigned to the 421st Transport Squadron RVNAF Douglas C-47A of the 415th Transport Squadron. These C-47s remained in natural aluminum finish throughout the war The Paris Peace Accords of 1973 brought an end to the United States advisory capacity in South Vietnam. In its place, as part of the agreement, the Americans retained a Defense Attaché Office (DAO) at Tan Son Nhut Airport, with small field offices at other facilities around the country. The technical assistance provided by the personnel of the DAOs and by civilian contractors was essential to the RVNAF, however, because of the cease-fire agreement, the South Vietnamese could not be advised in any way on military operations, tactics or techniques of employment. It was through the DAO that the American/South Vietnamese relationship was maintained, and it was primarily from this source that information from within South Vietnam was obtained. The RVNAF provided statistics with regards to the military capability of their units to the DAO, however the accuracy of this information was not always reliable. From the Easter Offensive of 1972, it was clear that without United States aid, especially air support, the ARVN would not be able to defend itself against continuing PAVN attacks. This was demonstrated at the fighting around Pleiku, An Lộc and Quảng Trị where the ARVN would have been defeated without continuous air support, mainly supplied by the USAF. The ARVN relied heavily on air support, and with the absence of the USAF, the full responsibility fell on the RVNAF. Although equipped with large numbers of Cessna A-37 Dragonfly and F-5 attack aircraft to conduct effective close air support operations, during the 1972 offensive, heavy bombardment duty was left to USAF aircraft. As part of the Paris Peace Accords, a Joint Military Commission was established and VC/PAVN troops were deployed across South Vietnam to oversee the departure of US forces and the implementation of the ceasefire. 200-250 VC/PAVN soldiers were based at Camp Davis (see Davis Station below) at the base from March 1973 until the fall of South Vietnam. Numerous violations of the Paris Peace Accords were committed by North Vietnamese beginning almost as soon as the United States withdrew its last personnel from South Vietnam by the end of March 1973. The North Vietnamese and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam continued their attempt to overthrow President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu and remove the U.S.-supported government. The U.S. had promised Thiệu that it would use airpower to support his government. On 14 January 1975 Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger stated that the U.S. was not living up to its promise that it would retaliate in the event North Vietnam tried to overwhelm South Vietnam. When North Vietnam invaded in March 1975, the promised American intervention never materialized. Congress reflected the popular mood, halting the bombing in Cambodia effective 15 July 1973, and reducing aid to South Vietnam. Since Thiệu intended to fight the same kind of war he always had, with lavish use of firepower, the cuts in aid proved especially damaging. =Capture= RVNAF Lockheed C-130A of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force. The aircraft served with the RVNAF from October 1972 to April 1975. Now part of the National Air and Space Museum collection Captured RVNAF A-37 Dragonfly fighter-bombers were used by the VPAF Quyet Thang Squadron in 1975 for their attack on Tan Son Nhut Air Base In early 1975 North Vietnam realized the time was right to achieve its goal of re-uniting Vietnam under communist rule, launching a series of small ground attacks to test U.S. reaction. On 8 January the North Vietnamese Politburo ordered a PAVN offensive to \\"liberate\\" South Vietnam by cross-border invasion. The general staff plan for the invasion of South Vietnam called for 20 divisions, it anticipated a two-year struggle for victory. By 14 March, South Vietnamese President Thiệu decided to abandon the Central Highlands region and two northern provinces of South Vietnam and ordered a general withdrawal of ARVN forces from those areas. Instead of an orderly withdrawal, it turned into a general retreat, with masses of military and civilians fleeing, clogging roads and creating chaos. On 30 March 100,000 South Vietnamese soldiers surrendered after being abandoned by their commanding officers. The large coastal cities of Da Nang, Qui Nhơn, Tuy Hòa and Nha Trang were abandoned by the South Vietnamese, yielding the entire northern half of South Vietnam to the North Vietnamese. By late March the US Embassy began to reduce the number of US citizens in Vietnam by encouraging dependents and non-essential personnel to leave the country by commercial flights and on Military Airlift Command (MAC) C-141 and C-5 aircraft, which were still bringing in emergency military supplies. In late March, two or three of these MAC aircraft were arriving each day and were used for the evacuation of civilians and Vietnamese orphans. On 4 April a C-5A aircraft carrying 250 Vietnamese orphans and their escorts suffered explosive decompression over the sea near Vũng Tàu and made a crash- landing while attempting to return to Tan Son Nhut; 153 people on board died in the crash. As the war in South Vietnam entered its conclusion, the pilots of the RVNAF flew sortie after sortie, supporting the retreating ARVN after it abandoned Cam Ranh Bay on 14 April. For two days after the ARVN left the area, the Wing Commander at Phan Rang Air Base fought on with the forces under his command. Airborne troops were sent in for one last attempt to hold the airfield, but the defenders were finally overrun on 16 April and Phan Rang Air Base was lost. On 22 April Xuân Lộc fell to the PAVN after a two-week battle with the ARVN 18th Division which inflicted over 5000 PAVN casualties and delayed the Ho Chi Minh Campaign for two weeks. With the fall of Xuân Lộc and the capture of Bien Hoa Air Base in late April 1975 it was clear that South Vietnam was about to fall to the PAVN. By 22 April 20 C-141 and 20 C-130s flights a day were flying evacuees out of Tan Son Nhut to Clark Air Base, some 1,000 miles away in the Philippines. On 23 April President Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines announced that no more than 2,500 Vietnamese evacuees would be allowed in the Philippines at any one time, further increasing the strain on MAC which now had to move evacuees out of Saigon and move some 5,000 evacuees from Clark Air Base on to Guam, Wake Island and Yokota Air Base. President Thiệu and his family left Tan Son Nhut on 25 April on a USAF C-118 to go into exile in Taiwan. Also on 25 April the Federal Aviation Authority banned commercial flights into South Vietnam. This directive was subsequently reversed; some operators had ignored it anyway. In any case this effectively marked the end of the commercial airlift from Tan Son Nhut. On 27 April PAVN rockets hit Saigon and Cholon for the first time since the 1973 ceasefire. It was decided that from this time only C-130s would be used for the evacuation due to their greater maneuverability. There was relatively little difference between the cargo loads of the two aircraft, C-141s had been loaded with up to 316 evacuees while C-130s had been taking off with in excess of 240. On 28 April at 18:06, three A-37 Dragonflies piloted by former RVNAF pilots, who had defected to the Vietnamese People's Air Force at the fall of Da Nang, dropped six Mk81 250 lb bombs on the base damaging aircraft. RVNAF F-5s took off in pursuit, but they were unable to intercept the A-37s. C-130s leaving Tan Son Nhut reported receiving PAVN .51 cal and 37 mm anti-aircraft (AAA) fire, while sporadic PAVN rocket and artillery attacks also started to hit the airport and air base. C-130 flights were stopped temporarily after the air attack but resumed at 20:00 on 28 April. At 03:58 on 29 April, C-130E, #72-1297, flown by a crew from the 776th Tactical Airlift Squadron, was destroyed by a 122 mm rocket while taxiing to pick up refugees after offloading a BLU-82 at the base. The crew evacuated the burning aircraft on the taxiway and departed the airfield on another C-130 that had previously landed. This was the last USAF fixed-wing aircraft to leave Tan Son Nhut. At dawn on 29 April the RVNAF began to haphazardly depart Tan Son Nhut Air Base as A-37s, F-5s, C-7s, C-119s and C-130s departed for Thailand while UH-1s took off in search of the ships of Task Force 76. Some RVNAF aircraft stayed to continue to fight the advancing PAVN. One AC-119 gunship had spent the night of 28/29 April dropping flares and firing on the approaching PAVN. At dawn on 29 April two A-1 Skyraiders began patrolling the perimeter of Tan Son Nhut at until one was shot down, presumably by an SA-7 missile. At 07:00 the AC-119 was firing on PAVN to the east of Tan Son Nhut when it too was hit by an SA-7 and fell in flames to the ground. At 08:00 on 29 April Lieutenant General Trần Văn Minh, commander of the RVNAF and 30 of his staff arrived at the DAO Compound demanding evacuation, signifying the complete loss of RVNAF command and control. At 10:51 on 29 April, the order was given by CINCPAC to commence Operation Frequent Wind, the helicopter evacuation of US personnel and at-risk Vietnamese. In the final evacuation, over a hundred RVNAF aircraft arrived in Thailand, including twenty-six F-5s, eight A-37s, eleven A-1s, six C-130s, thirteen C-47s, five C-7s, and three AC-119s. Additionally close to 100 RVNAF helicopters landed on U.S. ships off the coast, although at least half were jettisoned. One O-1 managed to land on the , carrying a South Vietnamese major, his wife, and five children. The ARVN 3rd Task Force, 81st Ranger Group commanded by Maj. Pham Chau Tai defended Tan Son Nhut and they were joined by the remnants of the Loi Ho unit. At 07:15 on 30 April the PAVN 24th Regiment approached the Bay Hien intersection () 1.5 km from the base's main gate. The lead T-54 was hit by M67 recoilless rifle and then the next T-54 was hit by a shell from an M48 tank. The PAVN infantry moved forward and engaged the ARVN in house to house fighting forcing them to withdraw to the base by 08:45. The PAVN then sent 3 tanks and an infantry battalion to assault the main gate and they were met by intensive anti-tank and machine gun fire knocking out the 3 tanks and killing at least 20 PAVN soldiers. The PAVN tried to bring forward an 85mm antiaircraft gun but the ARVN knocked it out before it could start firing. The PAVN 10th Division ordered 8 more tanks and another infantry battalion to join the attack, but as they approached the Bay Hien intersection they were hit by an airstrike from RVNAF jets operating from Binh Thuy Air Base which destroyed 2 T-54s. The 6 surviving tanks arrived at the main gate at 10:00 and began their attack, with 2 being knocked out by antitank fire in front of the gate and another destroyed as it attempted a flanking manoeuvre. At approximately 10:30 Maj. Pham heard of the surrender broadcast of President Dương Văn Minh and went to the ARVN Joint General Staff Compound to seek instructions, he called General Minh who told him to prepare to surrender, Pham reportedly told Minh \\"If Viet Cong tanks are entering Independence Palace we will come down there to rescue you sir.\\" Minh refused Pham's suggestion and Pham then told his men to withdraw from the base gates and at 11:30 the PAVN entered the base. Following the war, Tan Son Nhut Air Base was taken over as a base for the Vietnam People's Air Force. =Known RVNAF units (June 1974)= Tan Son Nhut Air Base was the Headquarters of the RVNAF. It was also the headquarters of the RVNAF 5th Air Division.

The base served as the focal point for the initial USAF deployment and buildup in South Vietnam in the early 1960s. Tan Son Nhut was initially the main air base for Military Airlift Command flights to and from South Vietnam, until other bases such as Bien Hoa and Cam Ranh opened in 1966. After 1966, with the establishment of the 7th Air Force as the main USAF command and control headquarters in South Vietnam, Tan Son Nhut functioned as a Headquarters base, a Tactical Reconnaissance base, and as a Special Operations base. With the drawdown of US forces in South Vietnam after 1971, the base took on a myriad of organizations transferred from deactivated bases across South Vietnam. Between 1968 and 1974, Tan Son Nhut Airport was one of the busiest military airbases in the world. Pan Am schedules from 1973 showed Boeing 747 service was being operated four times a week to San Francisco via Guam and Manila. Continental Airlines operated up to 30 Boeing 707 military charters per week to and from Tan Son Nhut Airport during the 1968–74 period. It was from Tan Son Nhut Air Base that the last U.S. Airman left South Vietnam in March 1973. The Air Force Post Office (APO) for Tan Son Nhut Air Base was APO San Francisco, 96307. =Military Assistance Advisory Group= thumb Davis Station On 13 May 1961 a 92-man unit of the Army Security Agency, operating under cover of the 3rd Radio Research Unit (3rd RRU), arrived at Tan Son Nhut AB and established a communications intelligence facility in disused RVNAF warehouses on the base (). This was the first full deployment of a US Army unit to South Vietnam. On 21 December 1961 SP4 James T. Davis of the 3rd RRU was operating a mobile PRD-1 receiver with an ARVN unit near Cầu Xáng when they were ambushed by VC and Davis was killed, becoming one of the first Americans killed in the Vietnam War. In early January 1962 the 3rd RRU's compound at Tan Son Nhut was renamed Davis Station. On 1 June 1966 3rd RRU was redesignated the 509th Radio Research Group. The 509th RR Group continued operations until 7 March 1973, when they were among the last US units to leave South Vietnam. 507th Tactical Control Group In late September 1961, the first permanent USAF unit, the 507th Tactical Control Group from Shaw Air Force Base deployed sixty-seven officers and airmen to Tan Son Nhut to install MPS-11 search and MPS-16 height-finding radars and began monitoring air traffic and training of RVNAF personnel to operate and service the equipment. Installation of the equipment commenced on 5 October 1961 and the unit would eventually grow to 314 assigned personnel. This organization formed the nucleus of South Vietnam's tactical air control system. Tactical Reconnaissance Mission 15th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron McDonnell RF-101C-60-MC Voodoo 56-0042 On 18 October 1961, four RF-101C Voodoos and a photo processing unit from the 15th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron of the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, based at Yokota AB Japan, arrived at Tan Son Nhut, with the reconnaissance craft flying photographic missions over South Vietnam and Laos from 20 October under Operation Pipe Stem. The RF-101s would depart in January 1962 leaving Detachment 1, 15th tactical Reconnaissance Squadron to undertake photo-processing. In March 1962 a C-54 Skymaster outfitted for infrared reconnaissance arrived at the base and would remain here until February 1963, when it was replaced by a Brave Bull C-97. In December 1962 following the signing of the International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos, which banned aerial reconnaissance over Laos, all 4 Able Marble RF-101Cs of the moved to the base from Don Muang Royal Thai Air Force Base. On 13 April 1963 the 13th Reconnaissance Technical Squadron was established at the base to provide photo interpretation and targeting information. Following the Gulf of Tonkin Incident on 4 August 1964, 6 additional RF-101Cs deployed to the base. The 67th TRW was soon followed by detachments of the 15th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron of the 18th Tactical Fighter Wing, based at Kadena AB, Okinawa, which also flew RF-101 reconnaissance missions over Laos and South Vietnam, first from bases at Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand from 31 March 1965 to 31 October 1967 and then from South Vietnam. These reconnaissance missions lasted from November 1961 through the spring of 1964. RF-101Cs flew pathfinder missions for F-100s during Operation Flaming Dart, the first USAF strike against North Vietnam on 8 February 1965. They initially operated out of South Vietnam, but later flew most of their missions over North Vietnam out of Thailand. Bombing missions against the North required a large amount of photographic reconnaissance support, and by the end of 1967, all but one of the Tactical Air Command RF-101C squadrons were deployed to Southeast Asia. The reconnaissance Voodoos at Tan Son Nhut were incorporated into the 460th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing in February 1966. 1 RF-101C was destroyed in a sapper attack on Tan Son Nhut AB. The last 45th TRS RF-101C left Tan Son Nhut on 16 November 1970. Det 1 460th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing Tan Son Nhut Air Base South Vietnam with RB-57E 55-4264, early 1968 The need for additional reconnaissance assets, especially those capable of operating at night, led to the deployment of 2 Martin RB-57E Canberra Patricia Lynn reconnaissance aircraft of the 6091st Reconnaissance Squadron on 7 May 1963. The forward nose section of the RB-57Es were modified to house a KA-1 36-inch forward oblique camera and a low panoramic KA-56 camera used on the Lockheed U-2. Mounted inside the specially configured bomb bay door was a KA-1 vertical camera, a K-477 split vertical day-night camera, an infrared scanner, and a KA-1 left oblique camera. The Detachment flew nighttime reconnaissance missions to identify VC base camps, small arms factories, and storage and training areas. The Patricia Lynn operation was terminated in mid-1971 with the inactivation of the 460th TRW and the four surviving aircraft returned to the United States. On 20 December 1964 Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) formed the Central Target Analysis and Research Center at the base as a unit of MACV J-2 (Intelligence) to coordinate Army and USAF infrared reconnaissance. On 30 October 1965 the first RF-4C Phantom IIs of the 16th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron arrived at the base and on 16 November they began flying missions over Laos and North Vietnam. Farm Gate On 11 October 1961, President John F. Kennedy directed, in NSAM 104, that the Defense Secretary \\"introduce the Air Force 'Jungle Jim' Squadron into Vietnam for the initial purpose of training Vietnamese forces.\\" The 4400th Combat Crew Training Squadron was to proceed as a training mission and not for combat. The unit would be officially titled 4400th Combat Crew Training Squadron, code named Farm Gate. In mid-November the first 8 Farm Gate T-28s arrived at the base from Clark Air Base. At the same time Detachments 7 and 8, 6009th Tactical Support Group were established at the base to support operations. On 20 May these detachments were redesignated the 6220th Air Base Squadron. In February 1963 4 RB-26C night photo-reconnaissance aircraft joined the Farm Gate planes at the base. Tactical Air Control Center The establishment of a country-wide tactical air control center was regarded as a priority for the effective utilisation of the RVNAF's limited strike capabilities, in addition an air operations center for central planning of air operations and a subordinate radar reporting center were also required. From 2–14 January the 5th Tactical Control Group was deployed to the base, beginning operations on 13 January 1962. In March 1963 MACV formed a flight service center and network at the base for the control of all US military flights in South Vietnam. Mule Train Mule Train C-123B Provider in early 1962 On 6 December 1961, the Defense Department ordered the C-123 equipped 346th Troop Carrier Squadron (Assault) to the Far East for 120 days temporary duty. On 2 January 1962 the first of 16 C-123s landed at the base commencing Operation Mule Train to provide logistical support to US and South Vietnamese forces. In March 1962 personnel from the 776th Troop Carrier Squadron, began replacing the temporary duty personnel. 10 of the C-123s were based at Tan Son Nhut, 2 at Da Nang Air Base and 4 at Clark Air Base. Mule Train C-123 Provider #56-4382 was destroyed on ground by VC mortar attack on Tan Son Nhut, 13 April 1966 In April 1963 the 777th Troop Carrier Squadron equipped with 16 C-123s deployed to the base. In July 1963 the Mule Train squadrons at the base became the 309th and 310th Troop Carrier Squadrons assigned to the 315th Air Division. Dirty Thirty RVNAF DC-3 being flown by USAF \\"Dirty Thirty\\" pilots, 1962 Additional USAF personnel arrived at Tan Son Nhut in early 1962 after the RVNAF transferred two dozen seasoned pilots from the 1st Transportation Group at Tan Son Nhut to provide aircrews for the newly activated 2nd Fighter Squadron then undergoing training at Bien Hoa AB. This sudden loss of qualified C-47 pilots brought the 1st Transportation Group's airlift capability dangerously low. In order to alleviate the problem, United States Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, on the recommendation of MAAG Vietnam, ordered thirty USAF pilots temporarily assigned to the RVNAF to serve as C-47 co-pilots. This influx of U.S. personnel quickly returned the 1st Transportation Group to full strength. Unlike the USAF Farm Gate personnel at Bien Hoa Air Base, the C-47 co-pilots actually became part of the RVNAF operational structure – though still under U.S. control. Because of their rather unusual situation, these pilots soon adopted the very unofficial nickname, The Dirty Thirty. In a sense they were the first U.S. airmen actually committed to combat in Vietnam, rather than being assigned as advisors or support personnel. The original Dirty Thirty pilots eventually rotated home during early 1963 and were replaced by a second contingent of American pilots. This detachment remained with the RVNAF until December 1963 when they were withdrawn from Vietnam. 509th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron 509th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron F-102s Tan Son Nhut Air Base, 1962 Starting on 21 March 1962 under Project Water Glass and later remaining under Project Candy Machine, the 509th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron began rotating F-102A Delta Dagger interceptors to Tan Son Nhut Air Base from Clark AB on a rotating basis to provide air defense of the Saigon area in the event of a North Vietnamese air attack. F-102s and TF-102s (two-seat trainer version) were deployed to Tan Son Nhut initially because ground radar sites frequently painted small aircraft penetrating South Vietnamese airspace. The F-102, a supersonic, high altitude fighter interceptor designed to intercept Soviet bombers was given the mission of intercepting, identifying and, if necessary, destroying small aircraft, flying from treetop level to 2000 ft at speeds less than the final approach landing speed of the F-102. The TF-102, employing two pilots with one acting solely as radar intercept operator, was considered to be safer and more efficient as a low altitude interceptor. The T/F-102s would alternate with US Navy AD-5Qs. In May 1963 due to overcrowding at the base and the low-probability of air attack the T/F-102s and AD-5Qs were withdrawn to Clark AB from where they could redeploy to Tan Son Nhut on 12–24 hours' notice. Following the Gulf of Tonkin Incident, 6 F-102s from the 16th Fighter Squadron deployed to the base. Before the rotation ended in July 1970, pilots and F-102 aircraft from other Far East squadrons were used in the deployment. =Air rescue= In January 1962 5 USAF personnel from the Pacific Air Rescue Center were assigned to the base to establish a Search and Rescue Center, without having any aircraft assigned they were dependent on support from US Army advisers in each of South Vietnam's four military corps areas to use US Army and Marine Corps helicopters. In April 1962 the unit was designated Detachment 3, Pacific Air Rescue Center. On 1 July 1965 Detachment 3 was redesignated the 38th Air Rescue Squadron and activated with its headquarters at the base and organized to control search and rescue detachments operating from bases in South Vietnam and Thailand. Detachment 14, an operational base rescue element, was later established at the base. On 8 January 1966 the 3d Aerospace Recovery Group was established at the base to control search and rescue operations throughout the theater. On 1 July 1971 the entire 38th ARRS was inactivated. Local base rescue helicopters and their crews then became detachments of the parent unit, the 3d Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Group. In February 1973 the 3d Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Group left Tan Son Nhut AB and moved to Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Navy Base. =Miscellaneous units= From December 1961, the 8th and 57th Transportation Companies (Light Helicopter) arrived with Piasecki CH-21C Shawnee's. From 1962 the Utility Tactical Transport Helicopter Company (UTTHCO) was based here initially with Bell HU-1A Huey's then UH-1B's. The 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance) with UH-1B Huey's from January 1963. During December 1964 the 145th Aviation Battalion were deployed here. In April 1964 5 EC-121D airborne early warning aircraft began staging from the base. In June 1964 Detachment 2, 421st Air Refueling Squadron equipped with KB-50 aerial refueling aircraft deployed to the base to support Yankee Team operations over Laos. In April 1965 a detachment of the 9th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron comprising 4 RB–66Bs and 2 EB–66Cs arrived at the base. The RB–66Bs were equipped with night photo and infrared sensor equipment and began reconnaissance missions over South Vietnam, while the EB–66Cs began flying missions against North Vietnamese air defense radars. By the end of May, two more EB–66Cs arrived at the base and they all then redeployed to Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base. In mid-May 1965, following the disaster at Bien Hoa the 10 surviving B-57 bombers were transferred to Tan Son Nhut AB and continued to fly sorties on a reduced scale until replacement aircraft arrived from Clark AB. In June 1965, the B-57s were moved from Tan Son Nhut AB to Da Nang AB. On 8 October 1965 the 20th Helicopter Squadron equipped with 14 CH-3 helicopters was activated at the base, it moved to Nha Trang Air Base on 15 June 1966. =33rd Tactical Group= 100px 33rd Tactical Group RF-101Cs at Tan Son Nhut, 1965 On 8 July 1963 the units at the base were organized as the 33d Tactical Group, with subordinate units being the 33rd Air Base Squadron, the 33rd Consolidated Aircraft maintenance Squadron and the Detachment 1 reconnaissance elements. The Group's mission was to maintain and operate base support facilities at Tan Son Nhut, supporting the 2d Air Division and subordinate units by performing reconnaissance. 505th Tactical Air Control Group USAF Cessna O-1 (L-19) \\"Bird Dog\\" An O-2 Skymaster dropping leaflets over Vietnam The 505th Tactical Air Control Group was assigned to Tan Son Nhut on 8 April 1964. The Unit was primarily responsible for controlling the tactical air resources of the US and its allies in South Vietnam, Thailand, and to some extent Cambodia and Laos. Carrying out the mission of providing tactical air support required two major components, radar installations and forward air controllers (FACs). The radar sites provided flight separation for attack and transport aircraft which took the form of flight following and, in some cases control by USAF Weapons Directors. FACs had the critical job of telling tactical fighters where to drop their ordnance. FAC's were generally attached to either US Army or ARVN units and served both on the ground and in the air. Squadrons of the 505th located at Tan Son Nhut AB were: * 619th Tactical Control Squadron activated at the base on 8 April 1964 It was responsible for operating and maintaining air traffic control and radar direction-finding equipment for the area from the Mekong Delta to Buôn Ma Thuột in the Central Highlands with detachments at various smaller airfields throughout its operational area. It remained operational until 15 March 1973. * 505th Tactical Control Maintenance Squadron Close air support North American F-100Ds of the 481st Tactical Fighter Squadron over South Vietnam Following the introduction of US ground combat units in mid-1965, two F-100 squadrons were deployed to Tan Son Nhut AB to provide close air support for US ground forces: * 481st Tactical Fighter Squadron, 29 June 1965 – 1 January 1966 * 416th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 1 November 1965 – 15 June 1966 The 481st returned to the United States; the 416th returned to Bien Hoa. =6250th Combat Support Group= The first tasks facing the USAF, however, were to set up a workable organizational structure in the region, improve the area's inadequate air bases, create an efficient airlift system, and develop equipment and techniques to support the ground battle. Starting in 1965, the USAF adjusted its structure in Southeast Asia to absorb incoming units. Temporarily deployed squadrons became permanent in November. A wing structure replaced the groups. On 8 July 1965, the 33d Tactical Group was redesignated the 6250th Combat Support Group. The number of personnel at Tan Son Nhut AB increased from 7780 at the beginning of 1965 to over 15,000 by the end of the year, placing substantial demands for accommodation and basic infrastructure. On 14 November 1965 the 4th Air Commando Squadron equipped with 20 AC-47 Spooky gunships arrived at the base and was assigned to the 6250th Group. The aircraft were soon deployed to forward operating locations at Binh Thuy, Da Nang, Nha Trang and Pleiku Air Bases. In May 1966 the 4th Air Commando Squadron moved its base to Nha Trang AB where it came under the control of the 14th Air Commando Wing. =460th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing= 100px The Army Band plays Christmas music at the Tan Nhut Air Base, 22–9 December 1970 On 18 February 1966 the 460th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing was activated. Its headquarters were shared with the Seventh Air Force Headquarters and MACV. When it stood up, the 460th TRW, alone, was responsible for the entire reconnaissance mission, both visual and electronic, throughout the whole theater. On 18 February 1966 the wing began activities with 74 aircraft of various types. By the end of June 1966, that number climbed to over 200 aircraft. When the 460th TRW stood up, the Wing gained several flying units at Tan Son Nhut: * 16th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron (RF-4C) * 20th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron: 12 November 1965 – 1 April 1966 (RF-101C) * Detachment 1 of the 460th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing On 15 October 1966, the 460th TRW assumed aircraft maintenance responsibilities for Tan Son Nhut AB, including being responsible for all depot-level aircraft maintenance responsibility for all USAF organizations in South Vietnam. In addition to the reconnaissance operations, the 460th TFW's base flight operated in-theater transport service for Seventh Air Force and other senior commanders throughout South Vietnam. The base flight operated T-39A Saberliners, VC-123B Providers (also known as the \\"White Whale\\"), and U-3Bs between 1967 and 1971. Photographic reconnaissance * 45th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron: 30 March 1966 – 31 December 1970 (RF-101C Tail Code: AH) * 12th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron: 2 September 1966 – 31 August 1971 (RF-4C Tail Code: AC) On 18 September 1966, the 432d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing was activated at Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. After the 432d TRW activated it took control of the reconnaissance squadrons in Thailand. With the activation of the 432d TRW, the 460th TRW was only responsible for RF-101 and RF-4C operations. In 1970 the need for improved coordinate data of Southeast Asia for targeting purposes led to Loran-C-equipped RF–4Cs taking detailed photographs of target areas which were matched with the Loran coordinates of terrain features on the photo maps to calculate the precise coordinates. This information was converted into a computer program which by mid-1971 was used by the 12th Reconnaissance Intelligence Technical Squadron at the base for targeting. Electronic reconnaissance 362d Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron EC-47s at Pleiku AB, 1968 A few months after the 460th TRW's activation, two squadrons activated on 8 April 1966 as 460th TRW Det 2: * 360th Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron: 8 April 1966 – 31 August 1971 (EC-47N/P/Q Tail Code: AJ) * 361st Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron: 8 April 1966 – 31 August 1971 (EC-47N/P/Q Tail Code: AL) (Nha Trang Air Base) * 362d Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron: 1 February 1967 – 31 August 1971 (EC-47N/P/Q Tail Code: AN) (Pleiku Air Base) Project Hawkeye conducted radio direction finding (RDF), whose main target were VC radio transmitters. Before this program RDF involved tracking the signals on the ground. Because this exposed the RDF team to ambushes, both the US Army and USAF began to look at airborne RDF. While the US Army used U-6 Beaver and U-8 Seminole aircraft for its own version of the Hawkeye platform, the USAF modified several C-47 Skytrains. Project Phyllis Ann also used modified C-47s, however, the C-47s for this program were highly modified with an advanced navigational and reconnaissance equipment. On 4 April 1967, project Phyllis Ann changed to become Compass Dart. On 1 April 1968, Compass Dart became Combat Cougar. Because of security concerns the operation's name changed two more times first to Combat Cross and then to Commando Forge. Project Drillpress also used modified C-47s, listening into VC/PAVN traffic and collected intelligence from it. This data gave insights into the plans and strategy of both the VC and the PAVN. Information from all three projects contributed in a major way to the intelligence picture of the battlefield in Vietnam. In fact about 95 percent of the Arc Light strikes conducted in South Vietnam were based, at least partially, on the data from these three programs. On 6 October 1967, Drillpress changed to Sentinel Sara. The US would go to great lengths to prevent this equipment from falling into enemy hands, when an EC-47 from the 362d TEWS crashed on 22 April 1970, members of an explosive ordnance unit policed the area destroying anything they found and six F-100 tactical air sorties hit the area to be sure. Detachments of these squadrons operated from different locations, including bases in Thailand. Each of the main squadrons and their detachments moved at least once due to operational and/or security reasons. Personnel operating the RDF and signal intelligence equipment in the back of the modified EC-47s were part of the 6994th Security Squadron. On 1 June 1969 the unit transferred to become 360th TEWS Det 1. Inactivation As the Vietnamization program began, Vietnamese crews began flying with EC-47 crews from the 360th TEWS and 6994th SS, on 8 May 1971, to get training on operating the aircraft and its systems. The wing was inactivated in-place on 31 August 1971. Decorations awarded to the wing for its Vietnam War service include: * Presidential Unit Citation: 18 February 1966 – 30 June 1967; 1 September 1967 – 1 July 1968; 11 July 1968 – 31 August 1969; l February-31 March 1971. * Air Force Outstanding Unit Award with Combat \\"V\\" Device: 1 July 1969 – 30 June 1970; 1 July 1970 – 30 June 1971. * Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm: 1 August 1966 – 31 August 1971. =315th Air Commando Wing, Troop Carrier= 100px Members of Ranch Hand in 1964/5. The aircraft on the right is C-123 \\"Patches\\", now in the National Museum of the USAF Early in the program (and later on anti-crop missions), Ranch Hand C-123s carried RVNAF markings and a South Vietnamese military representative on board C-123K 315th Air Commando Wing, April 1968 In October 1962, there began what became known as the Southeast Asia Airlift System. Requirements were forecast out to 25 days, and these requirements were matched against available resources. In September 1962 Headquarters 6492nd Combat Cargo Group (Troop Carrier) and the 6493rd Aerial Port Squadron were organized and attached to the 315th Air Division, based at Tachikawa AB. On 8 December 1962 the 315th Air Commando Group, (Troop Carrier) was activated replacing the 6492nd Combat Cargo Group and became responsible for all in-country airlift in South Vietnam, including control over all USAF airlift assets. On the same date the 8th Aerial Port Squadron replaced the 6493rd Aerial Port Squadron.The 315th Group was assigned to the 315th Air Division, but came under the operational control of MACV through the 2d Air Division. On 10 August 1964 6 Royal Australian Air Force RAAF Transport Flight Vietnam DHC-4 Caribous arrived at the base and were assigned to the airlift system. In October 1964 the 19th Air Commando Squadron equipped with C-123s was established at the base and assigned to the 315th Troop Carrier Group. On 8 March 1965 the 315th Troop Carrier Group was redesignated the 315th Air Commando Group. The 315th Air Commando Group was re-designated the 315th Air Commando Wing on 8 March 1966. Squadrons of the 315th ACW/TC were: * 12th Air Commando Squadron (Defoliation), 15 October 1966 – 30 September 1970 (Bien Hoa) (UC-123 Provider) * Det 1, 834th Air Division, 15 October 1966 – 1 December 1971 (Tan Son Nhut) (C-130B Hercules) * 19th Air Commando Squadron 8 March 1966 – 10 June 1971 (Tan Son Nhut) (C-123 Provider) (including 2 Royal Thai Air Force- operated C-123s named Victory Flight) * 309th Air Commando Squadron 8 March 1966 – 31 July 1970 (Phan Rang) (C-123) * 310th Air Commando Squadron 8 March 1966 – 15 January 1972 (Phan Rang) (C-123) * 311th Air Commando Squadron 8 March 1966 – 5 October 1971 (Phan Rang) (C-123) * Det 1., HQ 315th Air Commando Wing, Troop Carrier 1 August – 15 October 1966 * Det 5., HQ 315th Air Division (Combat Cargo) 8 March – 15 October 1966 * Det 6., HQ 315th Air Division (Combat Cargo) (8 March – 15 October 1966) * 903rd Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron 8 July 1966 * RAAF Transport Flight, Vietnam (RTFV) 8 March – 15 October 1966 The unit also performed C-123 airlift operations in Vietnam. Operations included aerial movement of troops and cargo, flare drops, aeromedical evacuation, and air-drops of critical supplies and paratroops Operation Ranch Hand The 315th ACG was responsible for Operation Ranch Hand Defoliant operations missions. After some modifications to the aircraft (which included adding armor for the crew), 3 C-123B Provider aircraft arrived at the base on 7 January 1962 under the code name Ranch Hand. The 315th ACW was transferred to Phan Rang Air Base on 14 June 1967. =834th Air Division= 100px On 15 October 1966 the 834th Airlift Division was assigned without personnel or equipment, to Tan Son Nhut AB to join the Seventh Air Force, providing an intermediate command and control organization and also act as host unit for the USAF forces at the base. The 315th Air Commando Wing and 8th Aerial Port Squadron were assigned to the 834th Division. Initially the 834th AD had a strength of twenty-seven officers and twenty-one airmen, all of whom were on permanent assignment to Tan Son Nhut. The Air Division served as a single manager for all tactical airlift operations in South Vietnam, using air transport to haul cargo and troops, which were air-landed or air-dropped, as combat needs dictated through December 1971. The 834th Air Division became the largest tactical airlift force in the world. It was capable of performing a variety of missions. In addition to airlift of cargo and personnel and RVNAF training. Its missions and activities included Ranch Hand defoliation and insecticide spraying, psychological leaflet distribution, helicopter landing zone preparation, airfield survey and the operation of aerial ports. Units it directly controlled were: * 315th Air Commando (later, 315th Special Operations; 315th Tactical Airlift) Wing: 15 October 1966 – 1 December 1971) : Located at: Tan Son Nhut AB; later Phan Rang AB (15 June 1967 – 1 December 1971) UC-123 Provider. Composed of four C-123 squadrons with augmentation by C-130 Hercules transports from the 315th Air Division, Tachikawa AB, Japan. :: 2 C-123 Squadrons (32 a/c) at Tan Son Nhut AB; :: C-130B aircraft assignments were 23 aircraft by 1 November 1966 * 483d Troop Carrier (later, 483d Tactical Airlift) Wing: 15 October 1966 – 1 December 1971 * 2d Aerial Port Group (Tan Son Nhut) : 8th Aerial Port Squadron, Tan Son Nhut (16 detachments) :: Detachments were located at various points where airlift activity warranted continuous but less extensive aerial port services. Aerial port personnel loaded, unloaded, and stored cargo and processed passengers at each location. In addition, the 834th supervised transport operations (primarily C-47's) of the RVNAF, 6 DHC-4 Wallaby transports operated by the RAAF 35 Squadron at Vũng Tàu Army Airfield and 2 Republic of Korea Air Force transport unit C-46 Commandos from 29 July 1967, later replaced by C-54s. The 834th's flying components also performed defoliation missions, propaganda leaflet drops, and other special missions. The 834th received the Presidential Unit Citation recognizing their efforts during the Battle of Khe Sanh. In late 1969 C Flight, 17th Special Operations Squadron equipped with 5 AC-119G gunships was deployed at the base. By the end of 1970 this Flight would grow to 9 AC-119Gs to support operations in Cambodia. During its last few months, the 834th worked toward passing combat airlift control to Seventh Air Force. On 1 December 1971 the 834th AD was inactivated as part of the USAF withdrawal of forces from Vietnam. =377th Air Base Wing= 100px The 377th Air Base Wing was responsible for the day-to-day operations and maintenance of the USAF portion of the facility from April 1966 until the last USAF personnel withdrew from South Vietnam in March 1973. In addition, the 377th ABW was responsible for housing numerous tenant organizations including Seventh Air Force, base defense, and liaison with the RVNAF. In 1972 inactivating USAF units throughout South Vietnam began to assign units without equipment or personnel to the 377th ABW. From Cam Ranh AB: * 21st Tactical Air Support Squadron: 15 March 1972 – 23 February 1973. From Phan Rang AB: * 8th Special Operations Squadron: 15 January – 25 October 1972 (A-37) * 9th Special Operations Squadron: 21 January – 29 February 1972 (C-47) * 310th Tactical Airlift Squadron: January–June 1972 and March–October 1972 (C-123, C-7B) * 360th Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron: 1 February – 24 November 1972 (EC-47N/P/Q) All of these units were inactivated at Tan Son Nhut AB. An operating location of the wing headquarters was established at Bien Hoa AB on 14 April 1972 to provide turnaround service for F-4 Phantom IIs of other organizations, mostly based in Thailand. It was replaced on 20 June 1972 by Detachment l of the 377th Wing headquarters, which continued the F-4 turnaround service and added A-7 Corsair IIs for the deployed 354th Tactical Fighter Wing aircraft based at Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand on 30 October 1972. The detachment continued operations through 11 February 1973. The 377th ABW phased down for inactivation during February and March 1973, transferring many assets to the RVNAF. When inactivated on 28 March 1973, the 377th Air Base Wing was the last USAF unit in South Vietnam. Post-1975 Vietnam People's Air Force use Following the war, Tan Son Nhut Air Base was taken over as a base for the VPAF which is referred to by the name Tân Sơn Nhất. Tân Sơn Nhất Air Base is base of 917th Mixed Air Transport Regiment (a.k.a. Đồng Tháp Squadron) of 370th Air Force Division. The regiment's fleet consisted of: * Bell UH-1 Iroquois * Mil Mi-8 * Mil Mi-17 917th Mixed Air Transport Regiment was moved to Cần Thơ International Airport in 2017. Accident and incidents *25 October 1967: F-105D Thunderchief #59-1737 crashed into a C-123K #54-0667 on landing in bad weather. The F-105 pilot was killed and both aircraft were destroyed. * 19 June 1968 at 14:15 a pallet of ammunition exploded on a truck in the munitions area north of the base killing one U.S. soldier.

Biography Pfeiffer was native of Peoria, Illinois and obtained his bachelors and doctorate in pharmacology from University of Wisconsin and medical degree from University of Chicago. He has written several books on nutrition, trace metals, and biochemistry imbalances. In 1977, it was revealed that Pfeiffer was one of the researchers involved in behavior experiments for the Central Intelligence Agency. Between 1955 and 1964, under the project titled MK-SEARCH; he administered LSD to inmates in the Atlanta penitentiary and in New Jersey Bordentown Reformatory. Pfeiffer was interested in trace element and mineral metabolism in schizophrenia and what is now known as bipolar disorderPfeiffer CC, Braverman ER.

The Healing Nutrients Within: Facts, Findings, and New Research on Amino Acids, Basic Health Publications, 2003 Pfeiffer and co-workers reported that about a third of all the patients they examined had very high basophil counts, very high blood histamine levels and anomalies in their trace metal levels.Pfeiffer CC et al.

Extreme basophil counts and blood histamine levels in schizophrenic outpatients as compared to normals, Res Commun Chem Pathol Pharmacol. 1972 Jul;4(1):51-9. Pfeiffer collaborated with Abram Hoffer. Hoffer A, A Brief History of the Discovery of Kryptopyrrolle: A Diagnostic Test for a Subgroup of the Schizophrenias, Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine Vol. 16, 1st Quarter 2001. Pfeiffer founded the Princeton Brain-Bio Center, an outpatient treatment facility specializing Orthomolecular Psychiatry and Medicine. Pfeiffer also helped supervise, a residential treatment facility in Skillman, NJ known as the Earth House which was founded by one of Pfeiffer's recovered schizophrenic patients––Rosalind LaRoche who dedicated herself to supporting to Dr. Pfeiffer and Nutritional/Orthomolecular medicine. Pfeiffer argued that \\"For every drug that benefits a patient, there is a natural substance that can achieve the same effect.\\" Pfeiffer believed that biochemical imbalances were responsible for many psychological problems. After studying more than 20,000 schizophrenic patients, divided schizophrenia into three biochemical groups: Histapenia, Histadelia, and Pyroluria. Of all the disorders he studied, Pfeiffer was focused intently on Schizophrenia. He used the terms: the waste basket diagnosis, the plague of mental disease, demon possession and insanity. He felt the word schizophrenia was an inadequate and misleading diagnosis. He believed that \\"disperceptions of unknown cause\\" was a more appropriate definition. In his book, 'Twenty-Nine Medical Causes of Schizophrenia', he gives a comprehensive list of medical causes of schizophrenia broken down into three categories: well-known, less-known, and almost unknown. Pfeiffer suggested that most depressed people were born with a predisposition for depression, but that biochemical treatment would help overcome depression. Pfeiffer conducted a 12-year study which allowed him to classify behavior disorders into four categories based on trace metal patterns. Type A: high copper/zinc ratio, depressed hair sodium, potassium and lead sensitivity. These individuals exhibit episodes of fighting, oppositional behavior and mood swings. Type B: depressed hair copper, pyroluria, elevated histamine and elevated toxic metals. They exhibit assaultive behavior, absence of remorse, pathological lying, fascination with fire and cruelty towards animals. Type C: \\"mal absorbers\\", tend to be slender, usually impulsive and oppositional. Type D: depressed manganese and chromium levels. They exhibit nonviolent delinquent behavior.

Itachi is the older brother of Sasuke Uchiha and is responsible for killing all the members of their clan, sparing only his younger brother Sasuke. He appears working as a terrorist from the organization Akatsuki and serves as Sasuke's greatest enemy. During the second part of the manga, Itachi becomes involved in terrorist attacks to ninjas possessing tailed-beast creatures until facing Sasuke in a one-on-one battle. Although Itachi perishes during the final duel, it is later revealed Itachi had a secret reason for assassinating the Uchiha clan. Itachi is a playable character in most of the video games from the series. Itachi's character has been popular with readers of the manga, and has been positively received by critics. His appearance as an antagonist has been praised by several writers, although some have considered his initial appearance to be unsurprising. The gradual revelations of his past and its impact on the story has also received positive reception, and his fights were noted to be \\"one of the best\\" in the series. Numerous types of merchandise have been released in Itachi's likeness, including keychains, plush dolls and figurines. Creation and design When Itachi Uchiha is first mentioned by Sasuke Uchiha in the manga, Masashi Kishimoto had not planned out the character's backstory. The only idea he had was to attribute to Itachi some violent action that would have Sasuke wanting to kill him. However, when Itachi was introduced, Kishimoto had the idea to make Itachi Konoha's secret agent who killed his clan under their orders. Itachi was originally conceived as the leader of Konoha's Special Assassination and Tactical Squad called the \\"Anbu\\", dubbed the , which would have been a 70-man group divided into four teams, specializing in assassination and other illicit operations. However, this idea was scrapped in favor of the current Itachi working for the Akatsuki. From all the Akatsuki characters Kishimoto designed, Itachi is his favorite based on his backstory. Itachi's Japanese voice actor, Hideo Ishikawa, often talked with Sasuke's Japanese actor, Noriaki Sugiyama, about their characters. When the two characters first confronted, both Ishikawa and Sugiyama found Itachi's massacre of the Uchiha clan hard to believe and started to read the Naruto manga in order to see if Itachi was hiding something. After Itachi's death, the two actors noted that in the end Itachi served as a good older brother to Sasuke. English actor Crispin Freeman was pleased with voicing Itachi regardless of how many times he revisited the series. Appearances =In Naruto= Itachi is a member of the Uchiha Clan from the village of Konohagakure and the elder brother of Sasuke Uchiha. He grew up as the child prodigy of the Uchiha clan, establishing milestones for not only Sasuke, but also for future Uchiha to live up to. His early childhood was marred by war, the violence of which caused him to seek peace at any cost. Upon learning that his clan was planning a coup d'état to take control of Konoha, after his clan was accused of attacking the village with the Nine Tails, Itachi provides Konoha with intelligence on his clan's actions during his two years as a member of the ANBU. Over time, Itachi distances himself from his clan, as some clan members believed he murdered his best friend, Shisui Uchiha, to gain the . In reality, as Shisui possesses the ability to subliminally manipulate others and shares Itachi's love for the village, he intended to use his gift on the Uchiha clan leader to stop the coup d'état. However, Shisui is mortally wounded by the Leaf High Council member Danzo Shimura, who then takes his eye to achieve his own ideal of peace. When Shisui entrusts Itachi with his remaining eye, Itachi covers up Shisui's death to make it appear it was his doing. Eventually, in return for Danzo's offer to spare his younger brother, Itachi slaughters his entire clan. After creating the misconception that he murdered their family in cold blood to give Sasuke the mindset to become strong enough to kill him once he is capable, Itachi leaves the village, although he warns Danzo not to harm Sasuke. Meeting up with Konoha's Third Hokage Hiruzen Sarutobi, who promises to do what he can to look after Sasuke, Itachi reveals his intentions to continue to protect the village from the shadows. Soon after perceiving them as a threat to Konoha, Itachi joins the Akatsuki to ensure they do not endanger his village. Itachi becomes good friends with his partner Kisame Hoshigaki, who expresses concern for Itachi's wellbeing. Itachi debuts in Part I after Hiruzen's death, when he uses his infiltration of Konoha to hunt down Naruto Uzumaki as an excuse to secretly check on Sasuke's wellbeing. After engaging with Kakashi Hatake and some of Konoha's forces, he reveals Akatsuki's goal to gather the Jinchuriki which are the people that contained the tailed beasts which there are nine of. Itachi also learns that Naruto is under the protection of Jiraiya and sets up a trap to lure the experienced ninja away to grab the boy. However, as Jiraiya comes to Naruto's aid, Itachi finds himself facing Sasuke and directs his brother back on the path of getting stronger by defeating him before he and Kisame fall back. In Part II, Itachi uses one of Sasori's informants as a clone of himself to hold off Naruto and the rest of his team while he and the others seal away Shukaku the One Tail. Itachi remains on the sidelines until learning that Sasuke has finally severed his ties to Orochimaru, having absorbed him and now being strong enough to settle matters. Prior to his fight with Sasuke, Itachi meets with Naruto and, after questioning his intentions to save Sasuke, ensures the youth's safety with a crow with Shisui's as a countermeasure against Sasuke if he gains his Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan and attempts to attack Konoha. Sasuke ultimately tracks him down and they engage in their final battle, during the course of which he uses his Mangekyo Sharingan to push Sasuke to his limits. In doing so, Orochimaru is drawn out from Sasuke's body, and Itachi seals him away with his Totsuka blade before finally succumbing to his mysterious illness. As his final act, Itachi implants his Amaterasu technique within Sasuke, meant as a protective measure that will kill Tobi in case he ever tries to approach Sasuke and reveal the truth of their clan's slaughter. Unfortunately, having knew where Itachi's loyalties truly lie, Tobi survived and reveals the truth of Itachi's actions to Sasuke. This gives Sasuke a resolve to destroy the village, eventually having his brother's Mangekyo Sharingan implanted on him. Itachi reappears later during the Fourth Great Ninja War, brought back by Kabuto Yakushi using the Reanimation Jutsu, a forbidden summoning jutsu that brings the dead back as immortal corpses, to fight on Tobi's side. Paired with Nagato and forced to fight Naruto and Killer Bee against his will, Itachi learns of his brother's intentions and summons the crow he gave Naruto to regain his free will. After sealing Nagato, Itachi heads out to stop Kabuto and encounters Sasuke, with his younger brother wanting to know the truth once it is over. After a long battle, Itachi is pushed to use Izanami to trap Kabuto in an eternal time-loop in his own mind, to have him break his jutsu. His soul beginning to fade, Itachi uses his Sharingan to project his memories to Sasuke to reveal the full story of the events leading to the Uchiha Clan Massacre. Telling his brother that he does not have to forgive him, Itachi tells Sasuke that he will always love him, no matter what choice he makes from then on. With his brother's parting words, and accepting defeat after his final battle with Naruto, Sasuke renounces destroying the village and devotes himself to protecting it, fulfilling Itachi's wish for his younger brother. Sasuke even adopts Itachi's habit of poking on the forehead as a sign of affection, which Sasuke does with his wife Sakura and their daughter Sarada Uchiha. =In other media= Itachi is present in the sixth Naruto: Shippuden movie, Road to Ninja, where he leads an alternate-universe Akatsuki to help Naruto. He has a brief cameo in one of the original video animations, and is a playable character in nearly all Naruto video games, including the Clash of Ninja series and the Ultimate Ninja series. In some games, he utilizes variations of his techniques not seen in the anime or manga. Several merchandise items based on Itachi have been released, including key chains, plush dolls, and figurines. Reception Itachi has ranked high in the Weekly Shonen Jump popularity polls for the series, continuously placing in the top 10. He was ranked in fifth position in the polls of 2011, his highest ranking to date. The character received generally positive reviews from several publications for manga, anime, video games, and other related media. IGN reader Jason Van Horn characterized Itachi as \\"badass\\" and jokingly mentioned that he is a character to be afraid of since, in his first fight in the series, he does not make any remarkable move. He found that \\"there is just something about the cold and numb Itachi,\\" that makes the viewer \\"want to breakout in chills\\". IGN's Charles White liked the episode where the relationship between young Sasuke and Itachi is revealed, and hoped to see more of their past to resolve the mystery of Itachi's character commenting that learning about their \\"past has been intriguing\\". NTT customers voted him as their tenth favorite black haired male anime character. CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama referred to Itachi as one of his favorite characters from Naruto. In the Shelf Life section from Anime News Network (ANN) Bamboo Dong comments that Itachi is one of her favorite characters from the series, noting his background and his introduction as the best parts of the series. Activeanime writer Davey C. Jones celebrated Itachi's fights as the best ones in the series, noting his abilities to be as amazing as a \\"sci- fi ninja\\". Holly Ellingwood from the same website agrees, citing his fight against Kakashi Hatake as one \\"few will be able to forget\\". The reviewer also praised Itachi's attitude, commenting that he \\"is as cold and as ruthless as any villain yet\\". In a review of Volume 16 of the manga, Deb Aoki from About.com listed Itachi's introduction in the series as one of the cons from the volume. She praised his first fight in the series as very entertaining, meant to \\"whet readers' appetites for future fights between Konoha ninja and the Akatsuki\\". James Musgrove commented that Itachi and his partner Kisame \\"make a dramatic and well-timed entrance into the story\\". However, Jason Van Horn criticised the first battle between Itachi and Sasuke, as \\"good\\" but not \\"as epic as it should've been\\". His last fight with Sasuke before dying was considered \\"epic\\" by Casey Brienza from ANN. She found to be \\"a battle of minds\\" since, even after Itachi's death, Sasuke changes his mind about him when he learns about his past. She also anticipated the impact of Itachi's past revelations on the future storyline of Naruto. Despite disliking how the anime Shippuden used Itachi's light novel as part of the series, Chris Beveridge from the Fandom Post enjoyed Itachi's impact on both Sasuke and Naruto. Writer Jason Thompson highly praised his visual tortures, due to the effect it has on the victims, reminding him of the antagonist from Kiyoshi Kurosawa's film Cure notable for its horror scenes. Nevertheless, he criticized Itachi's death scene as a result of his disease rather than being killed by Sasuke, taking all the blame from his brother in the process. In 2014, IGN listed him as the fifth best Naruto character when the series ended.

It has had a convoluted taxonomic history. Richard Owen's mistake of associating prosauropod skeletal remains with the carnivorous teeth which Riley and Stutchbury called Palaeosaurus, combined with von Huene's Teratosaurus minor, which was also a combination of carnivore and prosauropod remains, led paleontologists to view prosauropods as carnivorous animals for quite a long time. This error made it into several textbooks and other dinosaur reference works. History and classification =Nineteenth century= The earliest drawing captioned Palaeosaurus (incorrectly captioned as Paleosaurus)- although this now lost fossil was probably not a Palaeosaurus (drawn in 1839 by Carlo Cattaneo for the first issue of \\"Il Politecnico\\") In 1836, two British scientists, Henry Riley and Samuel Stutchbury, briefly and informally published on two new fossil teeth found in or near the city of Bristol, England, which they called Palaeosaurus cylindrodon and Palaeosaurus platyodon.A series of posts to the Dinosaur Mailing List by George Olshevsky, regarding the history of Palaeosaurus: 1 2 3 4 Riley and Stutchbury did not mean to assign these species to Saint-Hilaire's genus of teleosaurids; they simply did not know the name had been used. Thecodontosaurus was also named in this publication. Only in 1840 do Riley and Stutchbury fully describe their two species of Palaeosaurus, each based on a single sharp tooth from the Late Triassic Period. The spellings were then corrected to read Paleosaurus cylindrodon and Paleosaurus platyodon. In 1842, Sir Richard Owen created the name Dinosauria. In the same publication, he attempted to redescribe Riley and Stutchbury's Paleosaurus and Thecodontosaurus, which he did not consider to be dinosaurs. Not knowing of the change in spelling, he changed the name back to Palaeosaurus, and this spelling was followed by all subsequent authors until 1959. Owen assigns other bones to Palaeosaurus, which would later be re- classified to the prosauropod dinosaur Thecodontosaurus. Contrary to Owen, in 1870, Thomas Henry Huxley described both Thecodontosaurus and Palaeosaurus as dinosaurs for the first time. He considered Palaeosaurus platyodon to be synonymous with Thecodontosaurus antiquus, most likely due to the Thecodontosaurus bones that Owen assigned to the former genus. However, Huxley regarded P. cylindrodon as an unrelated carnivorous theropod. American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope named a third species, Palaeosaurus fraserianus, in 1878, for an isolated tooth found in Triassic rocks in Pennsylvania. Today these are regarded as those of a sauropodomorph. In 1881, a fourth species is created, Palaeosaurus stricklandi; these are now recognized to be those of a phytosaur. =Twentieth century= Von Huene, in 1908, recognized the tooth of Palaeosaurus platyodon belonged to a phytosaur and placed it into the new genus Rileya, forming the new combination Rileya platyodon. One of the holotype teeth of P. cylindrodon was destroyed during World War II, in 1940. The other tooth survives to this day. In 1959 German paleontologist Oskar Kuhn, for the first time since 1840, recognized that the genus Palaeosaurus created by Riley and Stutchbury in 1836 was preoccupied and created the new generic name Palaeosauriscus to contain Palaeosaurus cylindrodon and all other species that had previously been described under Palaeosaurus. In 1964, Owen's mis-classified specimens caused American Edwin Harris Colbert to classify prosauropods into two groups – Palaeosauria, which included Palaeosaurus and Teratosaurus, thought to be carnivorous because of the chimaeric nature of Palaeosaurus; and Plateosauria, which included Thecodontosaurus and Plateosaurus, which had been described with the correct skulls, and therefore were correctly described as a herbivorous group. =Twenty-first century= Thecodontosaurus was redescribed by a team of paleontologists led by Michael Benton in 2000, which placed Owen's mis- classified material under the genus Thecodontosaurus rather than Palaeosaurus, and this is still followed today. Most of the skeletal bones ever assigned to Palaeosaurus cylindrodon and P. platyodon were also reassigned to Thecodontosaurus. The genera Rileya and Palaeosauriscus, as well as the species Palaeosaurus cylindrodon and Palaeosaurus platyodon, were all declared nomina dubia. In 2007, Peter Galton, reviewing the archosaurian fossils of the 1834 Bristol finds, reaffirmed the identification of the two teeth and humeri of Palaeosaurus platyodon (Rileya) as belonging to a phytosaur, and regarded P. cylindrodon (Palaeosauriscus) as an indeterminate archosaur. He agreed with Benton that Rileya is dubious, but suggested that Palaeosauriscus may be valid, based on its now-destroyed tooth with a \\"subcircular cross-section and fine, obliquely inclined denticles\\". =Efraasia and Sellosaurus= In 1932, Von Huene assigned new material to Palaeosaurus; numerous prosauropod bones found in Germany. Because of Owen's Thecodontosaurus bones misassigned to Palaeosaurus cylindrodon, the species was thought to be a prosauropod. Von Huene therefore referred his new species to Palaeosaurus, creating the name P. diagnostica. In 1973, Peter Galton, a British paleontologist, moved the species into its own genus, creating the new combination Efraasia diagnosticus. For several decades, most scientists considered Efraasia a junior synonym of Sellosaurus; however, in 2003 Adam Yates, another British palaeontologist, redescribed the bones assigned to Sellosaurus. He resurrected the genus Efraasia for some of these bones, to which he also assigned the bones that had been first described as Teratosaurus minor as well (although leaving out the teeth, which were recognized as non-dinosaurian). Like Galton in 1973, Yates's Efraasia also included the remains previously known as Palaeosaurus diagnosticus, although unlike Galton, Yates calls the species Efraasia minor, synonymizing both species. E. minor had priority because von Huene described Teratosaurus minor several pages before Palaeosaurus diagnosticus in his 1908 publication. The name minor therefore takes precedence over diagnostica for this species. =Species= Type species: \\"Palaeosaurus\\" cylindrodon (nomen dubium) Riley and Stutchbury 1836 (an indeterminate archosauromorph later renamed the type species of Palaeosauriscus cylindrodon, as Palaeosaurus was pre- occupied)http://fossilworks.org/bridge.pl?a=taxonInfo&taxon;_no=258123 Other species: *\\"Palaeosaurus\\" fraserianus (nomen dubium) Cope 1878 (an indeterminate sauropodomorph later renamed to Palaeosauriscus fraserianus)http://fossilworks.org/cgi- bin/bridge.pl?a=taxonInfo&taxon;_no=80769 *\\"Palaeosaurus\\" platyodon (nomen dubium) Riley and Stutchbury 1836 (an indeterminate phytosaurhttp://theropoddatabase.com/Nontheropods%20cladogram%20test.html later renamed the type species of the genus Rileya)http://fossilworks.org/?a=taxonInfo&taxon;_no=80767 *\\"Palaeosaurus\\" stricklandi (nomen dubium) Davis 1881 (an indeterminate phytosaur later transferred to the genus Palaeosauriscus)http://fossilworks.org/?a=taxonInfo&taxon;_no=80771 *\\"Palaeosaurus\\" diagnosticus Fraas, 1912 (alternatively spelled P. diagnostica, described by Eberhard Fraas in 1912, and re-classified as P.? diagnosticus be von Huenn in 1936; now assigned to Efraasia.

The Coalfields Trust defines the Kent Coalfield as the wards of Barnham Downs and Marshside in the Canterbury district, and the wards of Aylesham, Eastry, Eythorne & Shepherdswell, Middle Deal & Sholden, Mill Hill and North Deal in the Dover district.List of coalfield wards in Kent, The Coalfields Trust Coal was discovered in the area in 1890 while borings for an early Channel Tunnel project were taking place and the resultant Shakespeare colliery lasted until 1915. In 1911, investigation into whether there was coal or not was planned. Six ‘bore holes’ were put down in search of coal (the locations were Rushbourne, Hoads Wood in Sturry, Herne Bay, Reculver, Chitty (which is near Chislet) and Chislet Park – which is near the future site of Hersden). In the early years many collieries were sunk but failed and the East Kent Light Railway was built to exploit the anticipated business. Extensive plans had been drawn up by 1914 for major coal exploitation in east Kent, and the coalfield expanded rapidly in the late 1920s and early 1930s, with its maximum output reached in 1936. The outbreak of war and disappointing test results eventually resulted in only four collieries surviving: Betteshanger, Chislet, Snowdown and Tilmanstone. Had coal been more easily accessible, the open, rural landscape of east Kent could have changed beyond recognition. Geology Various geologists, including Robert Godwin-Austen, theorised that the geological conditions in East Kent were conducive to the existence of coal and therefore the potential for coal mining. Godwin-Austen put forward his views in 1857, and they were accepted by Sir Joseph Prestwich, who was a member of the Royal Coal Commission from 1866–71.Coal Mining in Kent The rock sequences found within the concealed coalfields of Kent, Berkshire and Oxfordshire have been formally renamed in recent years using terms established for the South Wales Coalfield.

The fact that its owners, the Anglo-Westphalian Kent Coalfield Ltd., had German connections caused questions to be asked in Parliament. The company changed its name to the North Kent Coalfield Ltd., and later to Chislet Colliery Ltd. The colliery was served by the Ashford to Minster railway, and a halt was built to serve the miners. In 1945, the workforce was 1,350, with 1,023 being employed sub- surface and 327 above. In 1963-4 a 550V.dc railway was built into the south eastern area of the mine. It had formerly used battery locomotives.Railway Magazine October 1963 p. 731 The colliery closed on 25 July 1969, the abandonment of steam traction by British Rail having taken away the market for its coal.Coal Mining in Kent Houses for the miners were built at Hersden, which still has a social club named the Chislet Colliery Social Club. ;Locomotives * Yorkshire Engine Company 0-6-0ST (works # 2498, built 1951) worked at Chislet Colliery from 1960 until its closure.

The colliery railway was by then using a mixed fleet of steam and diesel locomotives, with the final steam withdrawals taking place in the late 1970s.Steam traction in use, illustrated at Railway Herald magazine. The final three steam locomotives were named after saints with nearby Canterbury connections. St Thomas (named for St Thomas of Canterbury), St Dunstan (named for Dunstan, also a medieval Archbishop of Canterbury), and St Martin (named for St Martin, patron of England's oldest parish church, St Martin's Church, Canterbury). The colliery railway network was dismantled following the closure of the colliery in 1987. St Thomas and St Dunstan both survive into preservation.

An accident in 1913 killed three men and destroyed the pumping system, causing the mine to flood and work was abandoned for nine months.Coal Heritage in Kent The site was connected to the East Kent Light Railway in 1915 and coal first brought to the surface in March 1916. An accident at the pit on 27 February 1931 resulted in Sydney William Padfield being awarded a bronze Edward Medal, PDF the only one awarded in the Kent Coalfield.Pitwork An aerial ropeway was built in 1930 to link the pit with Dover Harbour. This included tunnelling through the cliff at Dover to deliver the coal to a 5,000 ton bunker at the harbour. It wasn't used much after 1935, and was dismantled in 1954.SimHQ In 1945, the workforce was 914, with 631 being employed sub-surface and 283 above.

Articles, when written, are assigned by Encyclopedia staff to Topic Editors for review and, if appropriate, approval and automatic publication to the public site. As of early 2009, EoE staff were reporting that there were approximately 1,200 contributors from 60 different countries on the Encyclopedia. The EoE has about 70 (as of late 2010) Content Partners, organizations that have a written agreement to provide their content to the Encyclopedia. Content Partners include organizations like the World Wildlife Fund, Conservation International, and American Meteorological Society. The EoE also cites Content Sources, organizations that have content in the public domain which is used in the Encyclopedia. In this category are various government agencies and Wikipedia. The Encyclopedia of Earth has a specific policy on use of Wikipedia content which requires authors and editors to carefully review and approve such content before using it and includes the following statement at the bottom of the article: > Note on Wikipedia Content: The authors of the content derived from Wikipedia > are not identified. The Encyclopedia of Earth Author(s) and Topic Editor(s) > listed at the top of this article may have significantly modified the > content derived from Wikipedia with original content or content drawn from > other sources. The Encyclopedia of Earth Topic Editor(s) listed at the top > of this article has reviewed all of the content, including that derived from > Wikipedia, and approved its accuracy for use in the Encyclopedia of Earth. > See Encyclopedia of Earth Policy on use of Wikipedia Content for further > details. The Authors, Topic Editors, Copy Editors, Content Partners, and Content Sources, are all attributed on the articles with links to biographical pages on those individuals and institutions. This is part of the EoE's stated policy of transparency. The Encyclopedia has a stated policy regarding neutrality and fairness\\"The Encyclopedia of Earth neutrality policy\\", Cutler J. Cleveland, Editor (Washington, D.C.: Environmental Information Coalition, National Council for Science and the Environment). that requires articles, when touching upon any issue of controversy, to represent every different view on a subject that attracts a significant portion of adherents, with each such view and its arguments or evidence being expressed as fairly and sympathetically as possible. According to this neutrality policy, the Encyclopedia itself does not advocate positions on environmental issues.  Content  The Encyclopedia includes content somewhat more varied than a traditional encyclopedia or other related efforts like Wikipedia or Citizendium. In addition to traditional articles, the Encyclopedia includes: ebooks, lectures, reports, and speeches. These source documents are locked on the authors' wiki and are therefore fixed. EoE staff report that some college professors are beginning to write up their lecture notes to result in full courses within the Encyclopedia. Two projects that use the EoE as a content repository and resource are the Climate, Adaptation, Mitigation, E-Learning (CAMEL) project and the Online Clearinghouse for Education And Networking - Oil Interdisciplinary Learning (OCEAN-OIL) project.

Heiney was born in South Pasadena, California, and grew up in South Pasadena and San Gabriel. He served in the Merchant Marine and the Navy during World War II and afterward earned a B.A. from University of Redlands. He joined the faculty of University of California, Irvine in 1965 and later co-founded UCI's writing program. One of his students was Michael Chabon, who later won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. His distinguished colleagues included novelist Oakley Hall, Victorian scholar and poet Robert Peters, and literary critic Hillis Miller. Publishers Weekly has described his work as \\"known for...metaphysics, hints of magic and the absurd, and a profound preoccupation with the duality of human nature,\\" and the Chicago Tribune Book World called him \\"a gifted craftsman, a meticulous writer whose powers as a story teller are as compelling as the sexual tensions he imagines.\\" His novel The Balloonist, published in 1976 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, tells the story of a polar expedition, similar to and possibly inspired by the real journey made by S. A. Andrée. The Balloonist was nominated for the National Book Award in 1977. It was reissued in 2011 by the UK publisher Galileo and in 2012 in the United States by The Overlook Press, with a foreword by Philip Pullman and positive reviews from The Guardian, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post. The Overlook Press also published his previously-unpublished novel The Carp Castle in 2013, and reissued his novel Screenplay (1982) in 2014, reviewed as \\"the mature work of a writer whose ability to juggle multi-layered concepts seems effortless.\\" The reissued Screenplay was also positively reviewed by OC Weekly and Kirkus Reviews. He received a 1982 Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences for his entire body of work. In 1985 his novel Tenth earned him a Special Achievement Award from the PEN Los Angeles Center. Heiney died in 1993, at age 71, at his home in Newport Beach, California.

Background After the massacre of Piet Retief and his men by Dingane on 6 February 1838, a number of Voortrekker camps were also attacked by the Zulu impis. These Voortrekkers appealed to other treks, particularly those of Piet Uys and Hendrik Potgieter in the Orange Free State, for help. Both treks sent out commandos to help. The two groups met on the banks of the Blaukraans River, where a council of war was held. During this meeting Uys was elected as \\"General Field Commandant\\" by those present - becoming, in effect, the first elected Boer Commandant-General. Potgieter, a natural leader, objected to this and stated that he and his men were not prepared to serve under any other leader. As a compromise, it was decided that each commando would remain under its own leader, but that both parties would fight together. This arrangement would prove to have disastrous consequences. The battle The two commandos (347 men) set out, in two separate columns, on 5 and 6 April 1838. On 9 April, near the Babanango Mountain Range, they saw a large Zulu impi and took a number of them captive (although it has been speculated that these may have been spies sent to lead them into a trap). The captives told the Voortrekkers that the main Zulu army was encamped near Umgungundlovu - the capital of their king, Dingane. As a result of this information, Uys led the parties directly to the Zulu capital. About 6,4 kilometres from Umgungundlovu they did indeed encounter the main Zulu army - at a mountain defile guarding the approaches to the Zulu capital. On each of the two hills at the end of the defile an impi was stationed, and another one waited in the valley between them - about 8,000 warriors. Uys gave Potgieter a choice as to which impi he would like to attack. Potgieter chose the one in the valley, while Uys decided to attack the hill towards his right. After riding to within 36 metres of the Zulu force, Uys ordered his men to dismount and open fire. Volleys from the Voortrekkers decimated the first two lines of the impi, while the third turned and fled. The battle appeared won. On his side Potgieter made what was reported as a \\"half-hearted\\" attack on the Zulu forces, and then retired. However, sixteen members of his commando attacked the Zulus at the base of the hill on the left, riding close and firing at them. The Zulus charged this small party, who turned and fled. One man was killed on the Voortrekker side. After the survivors of the attack reached the rest of Potgieter's commando, they mounted and left the battlefield. The remaining Zulu impis were now free to attack Uys' commando from the rear. Uys saw the Zulu force advancing and sent Gert Rudolph, the voortrekker leader that had replaced the ailing Gert Maritz, to Potgieter to request him to cover his rear. However, Potgieter ignored this request and continued retreating. The action of sending Rudolph as a messenger to Potgieter almost certainly saved Rudolph's life. Meanwhile, two members of Uys' party (the Malan brothers) had become isolated from the rest of the commando while pursuing the fleeing Zulus and were being led into an ambush in a bushy gorge. Seeing the danger they were in, Uys wanted his whole commando to ride to their rescue. Most of the members considered this too risky, and refused. In response, Uys formed a party of fifteen volunteers (including his son, Dirkie) and rode to their rescue. During the subsequent fighting Uys, his son, the Malan brothers as well as five of the volunteers were killed (for ten Voortrekker dead during the battle). The part of Uys' commando that remained behind (under the command of Field Cornet Potgieter), were surrounded and had to fight their way out. Due to the outcome of the battle, the Voortrekker forces involved in the fighting subsequently became known as the Vlugkommando (Flight Commando). Aftermath The commandos returned to their camp on 12 April. During a subsequent meeting of the Voortrekkers, Potgieter was accused of cowardice and treachery for his refusal to endanger his commando in an attempt to rescue Uys' party. In vain, Potgieter argued that if he had attacked, he and his men would also have died at Italeni. In disgust at the cries of \\"traitor\\", Potgieter and his followers left and returned to the Orange Free State. However, it has been speculated that, without the lessons learnt as a result of the Battle of Italeni - such as fighting from the shelter of ox-wagons whenever possible and choosing the place of battle rather than being enticed into unfavourable terrain - the Voortrekkers would not have succeeded in finally beating the Zulus at the Battle of Blood River eight months later. Site of the battle The exact site of the battle remains unknown and has been the subject of some controversy. However, the most likely area lies in a mountain defile guarded by two hills that is approximately 4,8 kilometres southwest of Umgungundlovu. It has been speculated that the Zulus named it the \\"Battle of Italeni\\" as some of the fighting took place at Itala Mountain, 24 kilometres away. There is a place called Ithaleni or Ethaleni... it is in Nkandla KwaZulu-Natal. The iThala hill is overlooking my home, about an hours walk away. The locals believe this is exactly where the 1838 battle took place. Here are places named from this hill. Ithala, Thaleni and Thalaneni. There are two schools Thalaneni Primary School and Ithala High School. A monument is erected at the hilltop.

However the project, which had already commenced construction, stalled due to the 1997 Asian financial crisis until 2020 and is currently revived by DBKL. The project, originally designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, was to comprise a 79-storey office tower, a 46-storey condominium, a 24-storey hotel and a 7-storey shopping centre. The original Puduraya bus depot was also intended to be replaced.  History  The project, which occupies a large triangular tract of land facing Pudu Road and Robertson Road, Kuala Lumpur, was previously a swampland before occupancy in 1929 by the Selangor Chinese Club, a social club consisting of a clubhouse mimicking the Selangor Club at Merdeka Square in layout and architectural style (in Mock Tudor architecture), and a vast field. The club was completely cleared away during the 1990s for the project. The site remains connected (but closed) to the Ampang Line's Plaza Rakyat station, which was opened in 1996 in preparation for the completion of Plaza Rakyat.  Abandonment and potential revivals  The Plaza Rakyat development was put on hold in 1998 due to financial difficulties faced by the developer and the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Abandonments have similarly plagued several other building projects in Kuala Lumpur as a result of the 1997 financial crisis, such as the Duta Grand Hyatt at the intersection of Jalan Sultan Ismail and Jalan Ampang, and the Vision City, Kuala Lumpur at Jalan Sultan Ismail. As of December 2016, only the base of the Plaza Rakyat complex has been completed. Efforts to revitalise the project, announced in 2005 and 2006, proved unsuccessful and the project continued to be stalled. On 26 October 2007, it was once again announced that the project would be revived after contract negotiations and amendments with the Government of Malaysia regarding the sale of the premises following the completion of the project. The project was then expected to be completed by 2012. However, little was said subsequently and the project continued to be abandoned. After a public walkabout of the site by the newly installed Prime Minister Dato' Seri Najib Tun Razak in early 2009, the problem of the stalled construction project was looked at yet again. The government gave an ultimatum to the developer, Global Upline, three months from April 2009 to come up with a development plan or have its contract terminated. In July 2009, it was reported that the new contractor would be announced by the following month. However, in August 2009, Federal Territories Minister, Datuk Raja Nong Chik Raja Zainal Abidin said that the government had yet to accept any proposals from interested developers pending a response from Global Upline. In December 2009, the government announced that it would terminate the deal with the current developer. The Federal Territories and Urban Wellbeing Ministry terminated the original contract with Plaza Rakyat Sendirian Berhad in 2010, 12 years after the company abandoned the mixed- development project. As of December 2012, according to Kuala Lumpur mayor Ahmad Phesal Talib, Kuala Lumpur City Hall was going through an arbitration process with the original contractor, with RHB Bank acting as the arbitrator. Following completion of the arbitration process, Ahmad Phesal promised to appoint a new contractor for the site. In November 2014, the city government of Kuala Lumpur (Kuala Lumpur City Hall) took possession of the site after completing the arbitration process. In doing so, the city government agreed to settle outstanding bank loans after negotiating over several months to reduce this amount. In April 2016, the Deputy Minister of Federal Territories announced that work on the site would recommence in June 2017, twenty years after the site was abandoned. In April 2017, Profit Consortium Sdn Bhd announced it planned four skyscrapers on the site, slated for completion in 2022.

It was originally transmitted on Thursday, 18 September 1969. Synopsis The platoon go on a weekend guerrilla warfare exercise. If they ever manage to find it, they have to capture Captain Rodrigues' HQ. Plot The platoon are travelling to a battle school in the country. Save for an incident involving Godfrey's weak bladder, the journey is uneventful. Disaster strikes when they arrive at the station Mainwaring opens the secret instructions, and it is clear that he doesn't know how to read a map. They start off confidently, but it's not long before they find themselves back at the station. They try again and Mainwaring leads them into an ambush led by a rugged captain. When they finally reach the school, they are greeted by a cheery Major Smith, who then proceeds to tell them that, to the platoon's horror, they have missed the evening meal by four hours. He introduces them to Captain Rodrigues, a tough Spanish captain (the captain who had led the ambush) who fought in the Spanish Civil War and doesn't approve of military disciplines such as arm-waving. He gives Mainwaring and the platoon a single blanket each to keep them warm and some carrots and onions to eat. Rodrigues wakes up the sleeping platoon in the morning with a thunderflash, telling them that they have missed breakfast as well. Walker is fed up with this and is determined to search for food at a nearby farm, but is scared off by the unimpressed farmer. Rodrigues hints that they will have an opportunity to capture his HQ; unfortunately no one has succeeded due to the fierce Alsatians, barbed wire and the electrified fence. The platoon are soon put to the test, and are handed what was clearly a quickly-made meal. As the exercise continues, Mainwaring falls down a hole, finds a secret tunnel and discovers it leads to Rodrigues' HQ. Later that night having been missing all afternoon, he returns to take the platoon through the tunnel and ends up in the stores. Walker is impressed, and it isn't long before the HQ is captured. On the train home, Mainwaring is relieved to find himself in his mens good graces again, though laments that he felt the platoon deserved a more tangible reward. Walker then reveals that he is fully laden with food as whilst the others were dealing with Rodrigues, he was cleaning out the stores. Cast *Arthur Lowe as Captain Mainwaring *John Le Mesurier as Sergeant Wilson *Clive Dunn as Lance Corporal Jones *John Laurie as Private Frazer *James Beck as Private Walker *Arnold Ridley as Private Godfrey *Ian Lavender as Private Pike *Alan Tilvern as Captain Rodrigues *Alan Haines as Major Smith *Colin Bean as Private Sponge Notes # The opening shot of the episode was taken from The Titfield Thunderbolt released in 1953. Stock footage was required as the location being used for their arrival was Wendling railway station, which had recently been closed by British Railways. Wendling station was also used on the episode \\"The Day the Balloon Went Up\\". # The area where the main exterior filming took place was also used for the new shots for the end credits (necessitated as the end credits for the previous two series had been filmed in black and white). A reminder of this episode was therefore present for the rest of the run of Dad's Army, with the cast walking past the trees in front of which the Spanish Captain is briefly seen standing holding a megaphone, and the shot of the platoon running across an open heath was used at the very end of all subsequent episodes under the producer's credit. # The idea of the platoon getting lost on their way to a training base and subsequently missing supper and breakfast was re-used in the 1971 film. Historic background The \\"Battle Camp\\" is similar to the school of guerrilla warfare that existed in Osterley Park at the beginning of the war. Like the one in the episode, the real life camp instructed Home Guardsmen in irregular warfare in case of Nazi invasion. The Osterley camp was even run by Spanish Civil War veteran Tom Wintringham, much like the one in the episode.

A former senior editor for Outside magazine, his work appeared in The New Yorker, National Geographic, Smithsonian, Vanity Fair, Men's Health, Garden & Gun,http://gardenandgun.com/article/moonshine and The New York Times Magazine, among other publications. He was also an advisory board member of the National Geographic Society, the interim editor of the Virginia Quarterly Review, and a lecturer in the Department of Honors Media Studies at the University of Virginia. He lived outside Charlottesville, Virginia. Life Born in Chicago, Illinois, Webster grew up in Chicago's North Shore community of Wilmette, Illinois. He graduated from New Trier High School and Kenyon College, finishing with a BA in English in 1981, and went on to attend Middlebury College's Breadloaf School of English for MFA graduate school. He then moved to New York City, New York, where he wrote for several magazines, many with the Conde Nast Corporation, where he was soon employed. In 1986, working with friends, he co-founded Southern magazine, which was purchased by Time, Inc. in 1989. After that, he spent several years as senior editor at Outside magazine before going to write full-time. In 1996, following a cover story he wrote in The New York Times Magazine about global land-mine proliferation, he co-founded Physicians Against Landmines/Center for International Rehabilitation (CIR). An international, non-governmental humanitarian organization, CIR sponsors field hospitals, wheelchair and prosthetics programs, plus prosthetics-fabrication training and disability advocacy in post-conflict nations worldwide. In 1997, as an early member of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, CIR was a co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. In 2006, working with the United Nations Special Rapporteur for Disabilities, CIR was central to the UN’s Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,https://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/conventionfull.shtml the most-rapidly ratified UN Convention to ever gain approval by the UN General Assembly. Webster served as CIR's vice-chairman. In 2005, he ground- reported and co-authored the United Nations report on destruction and disabilities created around the Indian Ocean basin by the 2004 Banda Aceh Tsunami. In 2007, he was co-founder and became President of Tidene/USA: the U.S. arm of the non-governmental humanitarian organization Tidene (which he also co-founded in 2006). Originally a France-based project with offices developed in Washington DC, and Agadez, Niger, Tidene builds water wells for humans, livestock, and agricultural cultivation, as well as schools and hospitals for the Tuareg people of Niger, the poorest and driest country on earth. Since 2007, 252 wells, a school, and a dispensary hospital have been created across an area the size of Germany. Together, these facilities help the Sahara's nomadic people survive and prosper (the ultimate goal is 400 wells). Funding has come from the U.S. Congress — through the US African Development Foundation, an arm of the U.S. Congress and USAID — and from a devoted conglomerate of French philanthropists and wine producers. In 2014, Tidene/USA was absorbed into a larger organization, Les Puits du Desert/Tidene. When asked in a newspaper interview about his beliefs on God, Webster responded: \\"I don't know. I don't know if there is a God. There's something. There's obviously a rhythm to the universe. But if there is a God, it has to be a man, because a female God wouldn't have screwed up the world this much.\\" He wrote \\"Traveling the Long Road to Freedom, One Step at a Time,\\" which was published in Smithsonian magazine; this article was recently used in the English language and literature pre-release material (AQA). In 2006 and 2007, he was co-leader of the expedition Running the Sahara, an on-foot crossing of North Africa from the Atlantic Ocean beach in Senegal to the beach at the Suez in Egypt. The expedition was filmed and edited into a documentary film, Running the Sahara, narrated by Matt Damon and released in 2007 with the logistics support of Sam Rutherford at prepare2go.com. The project began in Senegal and went through Mauritania, Mali, Niger and Libya, before culminating in Egypt. Runners included Charlie Engle, Ray Zahab and Kevin Lin. In February 2009, he and his son, James Webster, became graduates of Gruppo Storico Romano,http://www.gruppostoricoromano.it/en the Roman Coliseum's Gladiator School, as recognized gladiators with the organization's 11th Legion. In July and August 2011, he and photographer Ron Haviv traveled to Madre de Dios Region in southeast Peru for the Amazon Aid Foundation. There they documented the environmental destruction of the upper-Amazon basin rainforest by illegal gold mining, a practice that has increased exponentially due to a recent leap in gold prices. A documentary film team followed their investigation. The result is Amazon Gold, a multi-award-winning theatrical documentary film narrated by Academy Award winners Sissy Spacek and Herbie Hancock. Criminal conviction On August 14, 2014, Webster was charged with driving under the influence after he set into motion a fatal collision that, along with an 18-wheel truck, killed 75-year-old Wayne Thomas White Sr. on Afton Mountain's route 250 near Waynesboro, Virginia. In October, the commonwealth's attorney added a charge of involuntary manslaughter, and in December Webster was formally indicted. On February 18, 2015, he pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter. In the February/March 2018 edition of AARP Magazine he wrote that he began drinking and suffering from PTSD after reporting on the Southeast Asian Tsunami in 2004. He recounted how his personal and professional life had been ruined by the time he spent in prison saying, \\"As I slowly edge toward 60, with a broken family, virtually no money, nothing great in the way of work prospects and only my wits and a few friends who love me still around, I have a powerful remorse for the damage I have caused. But what I don't have — perhaps because I simply can't afford it — is self pity.

In the preceding case, it was held that the Commonwealth's extensive regulations regarding premises used for the slaughtering of livestock for export were valid under s 51(i) of the Constitution. In June 1955 the Privy Council gave special leave to appeal except to the extent they required a certificate of appeal under section 74. O'Sullivan applied to the High Court for a certificate of appeal. Dixon CJ, Williams, Webb and Fullagar JJ wrote a joint judgment refusing a certificate of appeal stating that the policy of section 74 was to confine the decision of essentially federal questions to the High Court. McTiernan, Kitto and Taylor JJ each delivered concurring judgments. The Privy Council took a narrower view of section 74 than the High Court, holding that the question of whether laws were inconsistent involved the application of section 109 of the Constitution and did not involve a question in relation to the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and the States. The Privy Council dismissed the appeal, approving the earlier decision of the statutory majority of the High Court,As this was a stated case and not an appeal, the decision of the Chief Justice prevailed: Judiciary Act 1903 s23 as amended by the Judiciary Act 1912. particularly the judgment of Fullager J.; .

It is even said that the Indians came to the springs for its healing powers. In the late 18th century, the land around the springs was granted to a Henry Storey by the king. Even George Washington was said to have stopped there to try the waters on a trip to Georgia. In 1825, John B. Glenn bought the land and opened an inn. The springs took its name from Mr. Glenn. His inn was so popular that in 1835 stock was sold to help build a large hotel on the land. The hotel was known for its elegance and comforts as well as its water. Small cabins and a bottling facility were also built around the inn. The bottles water was even kept in the cloak rooms of many congressmen until the 1940s when the hotel burned. Unfortunately, it was never rebuilt. At one point around the start of the 20th century, there was even a railroad that took patrons from Roebuck, then called Becka, to the inn. J W Bell owned Glen Springs from the 1930s until 1970.

It is home to the Aravon, Dunham and Rockport brands and the popular Rockport Cobb Hill Collection. Founded in Marlborough, Massachusetts in 1971 by Saul L. Katz and his son, Bruce R. Katz, the company produces footwear that is found in various retail channels in more than 60 countries worldwide. History In 1930, Samuel Katz founded the Hubbard Shoe Company, which had its first factory in Rochester, New Hampshire; eight years later the company employed 700. In 1945, Saul Katz took control of Hubbard from his father. In the 1960s, U.S. shoe manufacturing increasingly moved to countries with lower labor costs, making it difficult for U.S. plants to stay competitive in the face of less expensive imports. Saul Katz urged Congress to aid the American shoe industry and in 1977 the Carter administration imposed quotas on shoe imports, but the controls arrived too late for Hubbard, which went out of business in 1970. Saul Katz continued to run a surviving subsidiary spun off from Hubbard, called Highland Import. It operated out of offices in the old Diamond Shoe Company in Marlboro, Massachusetts and imported shoes from Brazil. Highland Import worked with American branded shoe companies to develop special products. One was a hand sewn heavy leather moccasin modeled after a shoe developed by Walter Dyer in Rockport, MA. When Saul Katz went to the tannery in Brazil he named the leather Rockport. The 3,000 pairs of moccasins brought into Marlboro arrived too late for Highland’s customer and so the shoes remained in the warehouse for some months. Bruce Katz then began working with his father and travelled the East Coast from Boston to Washington, DC, selling these shoes in plain white boxes to small leather shops and shoe boutiques in many small towns. The shoes carried no name until Katz learned that others were beginning to copy the shoes and calling them “Rockport type” shoes. He subsequently returned to Marlboro and decided to start branding the shoes as “Rockport.” In 1971, Saul Katz and his son, Bruce, formed The Rockport Company from Highland Import. The company was started with $15,000 and grew entirely by staying profitable each year. In 1986, shortly before the company was sold, Rockport’s sales were reaching nearly $100 million a year, having turned a profit every year since it was founded. In 1986, Rockport was preparing to go public when the family decided instead to sell the company to British athletic footwear giant Reebok. Bruce Katz remained as president for one year before turning over the management to a new Reebok CEO. Saul Katz stayed on as part of the management team until retiring in his 70s. Later Reebok was sold to German athletic shoe pioneer Adidas. On August 3, 2015, Berkshire Partners and New Balance Holding, Inc. completed the acquisition of The Rockport Company from the Adidas Group, and combined Rockport with DryDock Footwear, an affiliate of New Balance, to form a new company called The Rockport Group. In December 2017, sources reported that Crescent Capital Group, a major creditor of The Rockport Group, acquired ownership of Rockport from Berkshire Partners. On May 14, 2018, Rockport filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing a \\"costly and time-consuming separation\\" from their former owner, Adidas AG. Charlesbank Capital Partners purchased the company out of bankruptcy in July 2018; on July 23, the company's 60 brick-and-mortar retail locations were closed.https://www.newsday.com/business/rockport-tanger-roosevelt- field-1.20152428 The Comfort Shoe Rockport’s first product was the Country Walker, introduced in 1973. On the basis of the company’s subsequent RocSport shoe and those that followed, Bruce Katz is credited by the shoe industry monthly Footwear Plus with creating the \\"modern-day lightweight and technology-infused comfort shoe concept.\\" Rockport shoes of this period were designed as alternatives to athletic shoes, which were gaining in popularity as all-purpose footwear. Rockport focused on designing shoes that more closely resembled traditional styles, but sought to incorporate the lightness and comfort of running shoes. This development effort leading to the RocSport was \\"perhaps the first real 'high technology shoe',\\" according to James A. Phills, Jr., who teaches at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and Apple University, Apple, Inc.’s in-house business management school. The Walking Shoe The Rockport \\"World Tour\\" model, the company's signature walking shoe from the late 1990s until 2015. Rockport is credited with inventing the walking shoe and popularizing walking as a form of exercise and a healthy alternative to running. Under the leadership of Bruce Katz, the driving force behind the walking shoe, Rockport invested heavily in design and “spent lavishly on advertising and marketing to create a strong brand name and carve out a market niche,” according to The New York Times. Rockport also invested in research into the biomechanics of walking to design its shoes. In 1984, Rockport sponsored an 11,600-mile walk across the country and traversing every state to promote walking as a popular form of exercise. Company-sponsored walkers participating in “Walk for the Health of It” included Robert Sweetgall, whose books helped popularize walking for exercise. Sweetgall and the other walkers wore Rockport shoes and their trek was documented in a film, Walk America! Largely as a result of the company’s promotional activities, Rockport shoes became closely associated with walking.

Kurrajong is located north-west of Sydney,Kurrajong and Kurrajong Heights in the local government area of the City of Hawkesbury. Kurrajong is located to the west of the Hawkesbury River on the lower slopes of the Blue Mountains. It is north-west of Richmond on the Bells Line of Road, with Kurrajong Hills and Kurrajong Heights further west on this road. History Kurrajong is a popular destination for tourists who enjoy the village's peaceful atmosphere and attractive natural surrounds. Kurrajong is an Aboriginal name for several species of Australian trees in the genus Brachychiton, which once grew in abundance in the area. The bark fibres were used to make fishing nets, ropes and baskets. The area was first settled around 1790, not long after Governor Phillip had travelled down the Hawkesbury River in search of suitable farming land for the struggling colony. As early as 1795 an attempt to find a route through the mountains had been made but it was not until 1823, that Archibald Bell, following Aboriginal women escaping from the Springwood tribe which had kidnapped them, discovered a suitable route. By 1841 the convict built road through Kurrajong, named Bell's Line of Road, was opened. The present road, with easier grades, was opened in 1901. William Lawson was given a grant of near Wheeny Creek in 1810, but never lived there. Together with Gregory Blaxland and William Charles Wentworth, Lawson made a successful crossing of the Blue Mountains in 1813, which is now the major road to the west – the Great Western Highway. The oldest settlement was along Comleroy Road, which from about 1819 had been the main road north from Sydney to the Hunter Valley. In 1827 it was described as nothing but a bridle track and used chiefly to drove cattle to the new settlements in the Hunter River Valley. Former convicts David Hawkins and Job Wilson each owned 50 acres near present-day Hermitage Road. Hawkins named his property 'Timberinga' while Wilson called his 'Rocklands'. Along with the Davis and Peck families, these convicts were the Grandfathers of many Australians. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is a descendant of Joseph Davis, through Joseph's daughter Sarah. Sarah's two brothers married two of David Hawkins's daughters while another brother George married Job Wilson's daughter Elizabeth. Many descendants still live in Kurrajong. In the 1820s and 1830s, the notorious bushranger Jack Donahoe and his gang terrorised the settlers and travellers of Kurrajong and Richmond. Victims were robbed and sometimes stripped naked and their horse stolen, left to get home as best they could. A Mr. Harrington, living near Kurmond, was shot and killed in his home by gang member, George Armstrong. Several inns catered for locals and travellers along Bells Line of Road. One was the \\"Goldfinder's Rest\\", established in 1851 and run by John Lamrock. It was used by those going to the Turon diggings. About 1870 it became a Post Office and Store. The original building still exists beside Little Wheeney Creek and is a private residence. As more settlers moved into the area it was found to be suitable for the growing of fruit trees and the Kurrajong area became renowned for its orchards. By the late 19th century orchardists and others were lobbying the government to extend the railway from Richmond to Kurrajong so that they could get their produce to market more easily. The lobbying eventually paid off, and in 1926 the branch line from Richmond was opened. However, by the time the line was opened, the orchardists had begun to use trucks and the line was never economically viable. Landslides gave an excuse for the line to close in 1952. At the time the nearest High School was in Richmond and even today many people remember going to school on the train, which was known as Pansy.Woodsman, Spare those Trees: The Story of the Kurrajong Line Oakes, John Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, July 1997 pp. 219–242 During the 1920s and 1930s, the district contained many guest houses, especially along Comleroy Road. The scenery and natural environment attracted many city people for a stay in the country. The Kurrajong Heights Hotel, a building with panoramic views towards the coast, was opened in 1928 but destroyed by fire in 1975. The 1950s and 60s saw a decline in local tourism as people began to travel further afield for their holidays, in cars and planes. Kurrajong's orchards also began to decline and many properties were subdivided into smaller acreages. Horses and cows grazed on the paddocks once covered by fruit trees. For a number of years, in October, Kurrajong attracted many visitors to its locally renowned \\"Scarecrow Festival\\". The festival has not run for over 2 years due to internal disagreements in the local Scarecrow Festival Committee. Today there is a revival in Kurrajong. The scenery and rural tranquility has made it a sought after location for people wanting an escape from the bustle of life in the city. Many people have purchased small acreages as hobby farms or rural retreats. There is also a revival of guest accommodation, as the pressures of modern work have meant that people want a weekend away that is only a short drive from their homes.  Heritage listings  Kurrajong has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 164 Old Bells Line of Road: Goldfinders Inn Population In the 2016 Census, there were 3,062 people in Kurrajong. 81.7% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 4.6%. 89.9% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were Anglican 26.4%, Catholic 25.5% and No Religion 23.8%. Transport For 26 years, Kurrajong was connected to Richmond by a railway, with the train locally known as \\"Pansy\\". The shops known as \\"Pansy Junction\\" are near the railway station site, which now has an electricity substation on it. The line was closed in 1952, following landslide damage. There are some remains of this railway in the form of several cuttings located at various places along the line. The Goods shed at Kurrajong station is now part of the Australiana Pioneer Village in Rose St, Wilberforce. There is also the remains of a small wooden platform on private property.Pansy, Tourist Railway Association Kurrajong, 2000 There were plans to rebuild and reopen the railway as a tourist attraction by the \\"Tourist Railway Association Kurrajong\\", but this did not eventuate. An infrequent bus service operates from Richmond Station, but the most convenient way to get to Kurrajong is by car. Commercial area Businesses in the area include restaurants, cafes, estate agents, butchers, grocers, greengrocers, pharmacies, newsagents and post offices. Kurrajong Village is widely known for its fresh locally sourced produce.

It runs from the California state line along Woodfords Road to U.S. Route 395 in Minden. Prior to 1957, the highway existed as State Route 37. The highway continues into California as California State Route 88; both highways are closely related. Although Route 88 is a secondary route today, the highway is a historical route from when Carson Pass was a major crossing of the Sierra Nevada. Route description The route enters Nevada from California near Woodfords, California. Just after exiting the Sierra Nevada via the Carson River. The road loosely follows the river and the Carson Valley on the western edge of communities of Centerville, Gardnerville Ranchos, and Minden where the highway ends at a Y junction with U.S. Route 395. Despite the fact that California State Route 88 is an east-west highway, Nevada State Route 88 follows a nearly straight north-south path. History View from the south end of SR 88 looking northbound, October 2015 The highway shares much of its history with its California counterpart. Both formed part of a trail that went under such names as \\"Emigrant Trail\\", \\"Kit Carson Emigrant Trail\\" which has existed since the 1840s. The Carson Pass route was one of two primary divisions of the California Trail. The trail's use diminished with the establishment of the First Transcontinental Railroad which was completed in 1869 and follows a path closer to modern Interstate 80 across the Sierra Nevada. Newer names for the road have included \\"Carson Pass Road\\" after Carson Pass in California. Woodsford Road first appears on state maps in 1934 as a gravel and graded highway. By 1935, State Route 37 had been established along the roadway. The route remained unchanged until being renumbered as State Route 88 by 1957.

When Emperor Shao's brother Emperor Wen subsequently wanted to kill him, he committed suicide. During Jin Dynasty During the late Jin times, Xu Xianzhi served as an assistant to the official Wang Ya (王雅), and then to the general Liu Laozhi (劉牢之). Later, during the brief usurpation of the warlord Huan Xuan, he served as an assistant to Huan Xuan's cousin Huan Xiu (桓脩), where he was a colleague of Liu Yu and befriended him. When Liu Yu rose against Huan Xuan in 404, Xu Xianzhi joined his rebellion and served as an assistant to Liu Yu. When Liu Yu went on a northern campaign against Later Qin in 416, he served as the deputy of the chief official remaining at the capital Jiankang, Liu Muzhi (劉穆之). When Liu Muzhi died in 417, Liu Yu had Xu take over briefly for Liu Muzhi, although Liu Yu himself soon returned to Jiankang. Because of Xu's contributions, Liu Yu made him a general and a minister. During Emperor Wu's reign After Liu Yu seized the Jin throne in 420 and established Liu Song, he created Xu the Duke of Nanchang and made him the governor of the capital region, Yang Province (揚州, modern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu). He was regarded as a talented official who did not display emotions easily. The minister Zheng Xianzhi (鄭鮮之) once, while observing Xu and Fu Liang, commented, \\"If you hear the words that Xu and Fu spoke, you will no longer consider yourself a learned person.\\" When Emperor Wu grew ill in 422, he entrusted his crown prince Liu Yifu to Xu, Fu, Xie Hui, and Tan Daoji, and soon died. Liu Yifu succeeded him (as Emperor Shao), and in the mourning period, he had Xu and Fu handle important matters for him. During Emperor Shao's reign Emperor Shao soon became known for spending much time on frivolous matters with impertinent attendants, even during the three-year mourning period, and not on studies or important matters of state. Xu, Fu, and Xie became convinced that he was not a fit emperor, and considered deposing him. However, they had even lower opinions of his oldest younger brother, Liu Yizhen (劉義真) the Prince of Luling, so they first stoked the rivalry that Emperor Shao already had with Liu Yizhen and then accused Liu Yizhen of crimes. In 424, Emperor Shao reduced Liu Yizhen to commoner rank and exiled him. Xu, Fu, and Xie then prepared to remove Emperor Shao as well. Because they were apprehensive about the powerful armies that Tan and Wang Hong had, they summoned Tan and Wang to the capital and then informed them of the plot. They then sent soldiers into the palace to arrest Emperor Shao, after first persuading the imperial guards not to resist. Before Emperor Shao could get up from bed in the morning, the soldiers were already in his bedchamber, and he made a futile attempt to resist, but was captured. He was sent back to his old palace. The officials then, in the name of Emperor Shao's mother Empress Dowager Zhang, declared Emperor Shao's faults and demoted him to Prince of Yingyang, offering the throne to his younger brother Liu Yilong the Prince of Yidu instead. (Xu's associate Cheng Daohui (程道惠) had initially urged that Xu offer the throne to an even younger brother, Liu Yigong (劉義恭) the Prince of Jiangxia, to control power longer, but Xu and Fu believed Liu Yilong to be capable and therefore decided on him.) Xu remained at Jiankang, while Fu went to Liu Yilong's post at Jing Province (荊州, modern Hubei) to welcome him. Before Liu Yilong could accept or arrive at Jiankang, Xu and Fu sent assassins to kill both Emperor Shao and Liu Yizhen. (Fu had changed his mind after advice from the official Cai Kuo (蔡廓), but his letter to Xu to try to stop the assassinations arrived too late.) Liu Yilong, initially apprehensive of the officials' intentions in light of Emperor Shao's and Liu Yizhen's deaths, initially did not accept the throne, but after advice by Wang Hua (王華), Wang Tanshou (王曇首, Wang Hong's brother), and Dao Yanzhi (到彥之), accepted, and he advanced to Jiankang and took the throne (as Emperor Wen). During Emperor Wen's reign Fearful that Emperor Wen would act against them, Xu and Fu, prior to Emperor Wen's arrival at Jiankang, made Xie the governor of Jing Province to replace him, with the intent that Xie and Tan can counteract against the emperor should the emperor act against them. Once Emperor Wen had ascended the throne, he kept Xu and Fu content by keeping them in their posts. In 425, Xu and Fu offered to resign, and Emperor Wen approved and began to handle important matters of state himself. However, Xu's nephew Xu Peizhi (徐佩之) and his associates Cheng and Wang Shaozhi (王韶之) persuaded him that he did not need to resign, and thereafter he reassumed his post. (While it was not explicitly stated in history, it appeared that Fu then did so as well.) However, Emperor Wen was resentful that Xu, Fu, and Xie had killed his two older brothers, and in late 425 planned to destroy them, particularly at the urging of Wang Hua and the general Kong Ningzi (孔寧子). He therefore mobilized troops and publicly declared that he was going to attack rival Northern Wei, but was privately preparing to arrest Xu and Fu while engaging in a military campaign against Xie. In spring 426, rumors had leaked of such a plan, and so Xie began to prepare for armed resistance. Soon, Emperor Wen publicly issued an edict ordering that Xu, Fu, and Xie be arrested and killed, while issuing a separate edict summoning Xu and Fu to the palace. Xie's brother Xie Jiao (謝嚼) received news of this and quickly informed Fu, who in turned informed Xu. Xu fled out of Jiankang and then committed suicide in a kiln by hanging. His two sons were arrested and executed.

He is perhaps the first major figure in Sicilian literature following the Sicilian School which predates him by three centuries. During his lifetime, he was well known for his poetry both within Sicily and far beyond. He also wrote in Italian and Latin. Veneziano was born in Monreale, a contemporary of the great Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes (Sicily was under Spanish rule at this time). As it happens, both shared a cell after being captured by Barbary pirates around 1575. He wrote his greatest work, Celia during his period of imprisonment in Algeria (he was released in 1579). Cervantes is reported as having said that Veneziano had earned a passage to Paradise through this collection of poems (Celia means a jest or joke in both Sicilian and Italian). He wrote other works of poetry, also delving in satire and bawdy rhymes. He died in Palermo. When once asked why he chose to write in Sicilian rather than a recognised literary language such as Italian or Spanish, he replied to the effect that if a man is to seduce a woman, he must do so in her mother tongue. It is unclear whether a pun was intended. The whole of his works were assembled in 1967 in a publication entitled: Ottave, edited by A. Rigoli. Examples of his poetry Some extracts from his collection, Celia, appear below (circa 1575 - 1580). While the subject matter of the first poem, love, is typical enough of early Sicilian poetry, the second is a bit more atypical, possessing a whimsical quality. =No. vii= =No. viii=  References  * Arba Sicula Volume II, 1980 (bilingual: Sicilian and English) - source of the examples of poetry and English translation.

Rudolph Ganz in 1916 (Fort Worth Public Library Archives) Rudolph Ganz (Library of Congress collection) Rudolph Ganz (24 February 1877 Zurich – 2 August 1972 Chicago) was a Swiss-born American pianist, conductor, composer, and music educator.  Career  = Early career as a pianist and conductor = Ganz studied cello with Friedrich Hegar, and piano with Robert Freund at the Zürich Musikschule. He also took composition lessons with Charles Blanchet at the Lausanne Conservatory (de). From 1897 to 1898, Ganz studied piano with Fritz Blumer in Strasbourg, and from 1899 to 1900 with Ferruccio Busoni in Berlin and Weimar and composition with Heinrich Urban in Berlin. On December 7, 1899, he made his piano debut with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra; and on April 14, 1900, his conducting debut with this orchestra in the world premiere of his own Symphony No. 1 in E. In May, Florenz Ziegfeld, Sr. visited Berlin and invited Ganz to join the piano department of the Chicago Musical College. In August, Ganz moved to Chicago. Ganz joined the piano department and became a member of the board of directors of the Chicago Musical College from fall 1900 through spring 1905. On March 20, 1903, Ganz made his American orchestral debut as soloistJean-Pierre Thiollet, 88 notes pour piano solo, Neva Editions, 2015, \\"Solo nec plus ultra\\", p. 52. with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under Theodore Thomas in the first Chicago performance of Vincent d'Indy's Symphony No. 1, at the Auditorium Theatre. On March 5, 1905, in a Chicago recital at the Music Hall, Fine Arts Building (Chicago), Ganz became the first pianist to perform Maurice Ravel's music (Jeux d'eau (Ravel)) in the United States (Harold Bauer played a first Boston performance of Jeux d'eau on 4 December 1905). From fall 1905 to spring 1908 Ganz lived in New York City and began concert tours throughout North America, Europe, and Cuba. On November 8, 1907, in New York's Mendelssohn Hall, Ganz played the American premiere of Maurice Ravel's Oiseaux tristes and Barque sur l'ocean (from Miroirs,1905). In 1908 he moved to Berlin to teach and concertize. He played first Berlin performances of Vincent d'Indy and Béla Bartók and first London performances of Maurice Ravel and John Alden Carpenter. His Berlin pupils included Chicago pianist Edward Joseph Collins, St. Louis pianist Leo C. Miller, Kansas City pianist and later Ganz's assistant Mollie Margolies, Norwegian pianist Nils Larsen, and American composers Charles Haubiel and Edward Ballantine. In 1913 Ganz began recording piano rolls for Welte-Mignon and Duo-Art, and in 1916 for Pathé. At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Ganz returned to New York City and taught at the Institute of Musical Art (later The Juilliard School). In 1920 in Carnegie Hall, he conducted the New York Philharmonic in his own performance of Franz Liszt's E-flat Major Piano Concerto, using the Aeolian Company's Duo-Art reproducing Weber grand piano and becoming the first pianist to conduct an orchestra for the concerto in which he played by piano roll. = Later career as conductor and music educator = From 1921 to 1927 he was the conductor of the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra and did much to raise it to the top rank of orchestras. As the fourth conductor of this orchestra Ganz was responsible for building and educating a new symphonic audience. The orchestra's first recordings, innovative children's and young people's concerts, as well as extensive spring tours to the Midwest, South, and Southwest were the sources for this new audience. During his six seasons twenty-one percent of the music presented comprised first St. Louis performances. They included Maurice Ravel's Spanish Rhapsody, Gustav Mahler's Symphony No 4, Ottorino Respighi's Fountains of Rome, Ralph Vaughan Williams's London Symphony, Richard Strauss's A Hero's Life, Igor Stravinsky's Firebird Suite, Leo Sowerby's Suite From Northland, and Arthur Honegger's Pastorale d'été (American premiere). While in St. Louis, he was initiated as an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity in 1924 at the University of Missouri. In 1928 he returned to teach at the Chicago Musical College, serving as its president from 1934 to 1954, but he continued to maintain a national presence. From 1930 to 1933 Ganz founded and conducted the National Little Symphony (renamed the National Chamber Symphony) sponsored by NBC to promote contemporary music. He led the Omaha Symphony Orchestra from 1936 to 1941. From 1939 to 1948 he was permanent conductor of the Young People's Concerts with the New York Philharmonic and San Francisco Symphony orchestras, and from 1944 to 1946, with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. From 1946 to 1948, he was music director of the Grand Rapids Symphony in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which was a community orchestra at the time. On February 20, 1941, Ganz performed his own Piano Concerto in E-flat major, op 32, with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under Frederick Stock, its world premiere. The work was commissioned by Frederick Stock for the fiftieth anniversary of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Most of Ganz's musical compositions are held at The Newberry Library. = Legacy = Ganz was active in the promotion of new music throughout his career. Ferruccio Busoni, Christian Sinding, Charles Griffes, and Alexander Tcherepnin, among others, dedicated works to Ganz. In 1923 he received the Légion d'honneur of France for his introduction of the works of Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel to American audiences, and in later years he performed and conducted pieces by Pierre Boulez, John Cage and Arthur Honegger. Ravel, in a letter to Ganz, thanked him for his performances of Ravel's work, and dedicated \\"Scarbo\\" the third part of his composition Gaspard de la Nuit to him in gratitude. As late as the 1960s Ganz continued to pioneer new music. In 1961 Ganz edited fourteen early songs of Anton Webern that were published in three volumes by Carl Fischer, Inc. Earlier that year Hans Moldenhauer, Anton Webern scholar archivist at the University of Washington, and donor of the Moldenhauer Archives, had visited Ganz and his wife Esther LaBerge in Chicago. Moldenhauer, who was also a friend and former Ganz student, had just discovered a number of original manuscripts in the attic of the Webern home in Mittersill, Austria. Showing copies of the manuscripts to the Ganzes, he said, \\"Take whatever you want to perform.\\" They selected fourteen songs written between 1899 and 1904 when Webern was sixteen to twenty years old. In May 1962, Ganz accompanied his wife Esther LaBerge, mezzo-soprano, in the world premiere of the early Anton Webern songs at the First International Webern Festival during the Seattle World's Fair. Ganz's students during the 1930s and 1940s included John La Montaine (composer), Hans Moldenhauer, Joseph Bloch (pianist, Alkan scholar, and professor at The Juilliard School), Dorothy Donegan (jazz pianist), Edward Gordon (executive director of the Ravinia Festival), Wanda Paul (pianist and faculty member at Northwestern University), and Robert McDowell (pianist and faculty member at Chicago Musical College). Other students included Dean Sanders (Professor Emeritus, School of Music at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), Deniz Arman Gelenbe (Professor and Chair Emeritus at the Trinity-Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in London), Audley Wasson (1915-2001), Marion Edna Hall (1910–2012), who taught for many years at the University of Indiana's Jacobs School of Music, Abby Whiteside, Evelyn Hora, Gena Branscombe, Beatrice Sharp Karan (1918–1909), Evelyn (Wilgus) Lewis, Adrian Lerner Newman Goldman, Vera Bradford Arne Sorensen, Sheldon Shkolnik, Jeffrey Siegel, and Ludmila Lazar. He died in Chicago at the age of 95 on Aug. 2, 1972. A newspaper headline read: \\"A Last link with Liszt passes on.\\"  Family  Rudolph Ganz was the son of Rudolf Ganz, Sr., and Sophie Bartenfeld. He had three brothers: Paul, Emil, and Hans. Ganz married American soprano Mary Forrest in 1900, in Berlin. They had a son, Anton Roy Ganz, born in 1903, who later served as Swiss Ambassador to the Soviet Union. After Mary Forrest Ganz died in 1956, Ganz married Esther LaBerge, who was a concert singer and associate professor of voice at Chicago Musical College, in 1959. Esther LaBerge Ganz had one daughter, Jeanne Colette Collester, a professor of art history. Esther LaBerge Ganz died in 2007.

Kim attended Chinmyeong Girls' School in Seoul in 1908 where she was a good student, but she was subjected to slurs about her background and mistreatment from her step-mother's family(Kim's mother was a kisaeng). Kim dropped out of school in 1911 and in 1913 left for Tokyo to study at Kojimachi's Girls' School. She did not complete her studies there, but instead returned to Korea to earn her degree at Sungmyeon's Girls' School.

John Hepburn was the 2nd son of George Hepburn of Athelstaneford, near the town of Haddington and his wife Helen Hepburn, daughter of Adam Hepburn of Smeaton. He probably studied at St Andrews in 1615, and then travelled to France with his friend, Robert Monro visiting Paris and Poitiers.Monro, His Expedition, II, p.75 Hepburn was one of the many thousands of Scots who served in the Thirty Years' War. In 1620 Sir Andrew Gray began to levy forces for the support of Queen Elizabeth of Bohemia, and he established his camp on Hepburn family property at Monkrig. John joined Gray's forces, leaving Scotland in May 1620, and thereafter commanded a company of pikes who served as the personal guard to the exiled King of Bohemia. After the defeat at White Mountain Gray's forces united with Count Ernst Mansfeldt's troops, and by 1622 Hepburn held the rank of captain. He served during the battles of Bergen op Zoom in July and of Fleurus in August 1622. It was after Mansfeld's forces were disbanded in 1623 that Hepburn and his troops entered Swedish service. In 1625 Hepburn was appointed colonel of his own infantry troop at a salary of £380 per annum. He served with honour during Sweden's Prussian campaigns, particularly in the defence of Mewe against a Polish army of 30,000 in 1625. By 1627 his reputation was such that he became one of four Scottish colonels knighted that year by Gustav II Adolf, the others being Patrick Ruthven, Alexander Leslie and David Drummond.Murdoch and Grosjean, p.39. In June 1630 Hepburn accompanied the Swedish king to Pomerania when the king initiated his German campaigns against the Habsburg Empire. Hepburn jointly commanded with Colonel Maximillian Teuffel at Colberg, which capitulated to Swedish forces in 1630. Hepburn became the governor of Rugenwalde castle, after he and 6 of his companies were sent there to relieve Monro and Tisenhusen in October 1630.The Swedish Intelligencer. The First Part, pp. 63-4; Monro, His Expedition, vol. 2, pp. 11-12. Oxenstierna noted that at this point Hepburn was so competently in charge of his men that he had heard no complaints as the troops passed through Pomerania It was shortly after that that Hepburn requested that he be appointed a cavalry regiment as an injury he had received to the knee made the job of infantry colonel difficult. Monro noted that Hepburn's men were usually called upon by the King when troops were needed for particularly dangerous situations, thus in December 1630 4 of his companies were sent to join the royal army. Hepburn's forces became known as the Green Brigade.Murdoch and Grosjean, p.53 Hepburn proved very successful, as mentioned by Robert Monro, at the conquest at Landsberg/Warthe in April 1631. In September his troops distinguished themselves at battles at Frankfurt on the Oder and the Battle of Breitenfeld near Leipsig, where Hepburn was wounded.Murdoch and Grosjean, p.56. He commanded troops along with Sir James Lumsden and Donald Mackay, Lord Reay on the death of Colonel Teuffel. In December 1631, Hepburn as eldest colonel had the honour of 'the Storm' of Oppenheim. The Swedish Intelligencer records his actions in Bavaria at Donauwörth and Harburg Bridge where he was seconded by English volunteers including Lord Craven and Robert Marsham.The Swedish Intelligencer. The Second Part, p. 43; Monro, His Expedition, vol. 2, p. 91 He also served as an interim governor for Landshut before taking on the same role in Munich.The Swedish Intelligencer. The Second Part, pp. 145-6, 171, 176; Monro, His Expedition, vol. 2, p. 125. While in Bavaria he took a force of 2000 musketeers to join with Gustav Adolf in pursuit of the Duke of Bavaria around the region of Sulzbach-Rosenberg. They hoped to surprise Bavaria before he could meet up with Wallenstein's forces. By the time Gustav Adolf called all his forces together he commanded six infantry brigades, three of which were controlled by Hepburn.Murdoch and Grosjean, p.60. The two armies taunted each other for some time and by July, the Swedish forces were back in Nurnburg. Disease and desertion took their toll on both sides so that the armies were both reduced in size with few being killed in the fighting. Shortly after this it appears that Hepburn and the Swedish king had a disagreement which caused Hepburn to resign from the Swedish army. Some sources record that Hepburn, being a staunch Roman Catholic coupled with his flamboyant personal style had always irked Gustav II Adolf- others state it was because he was not given the rank of lieutenant-general, but the actual cause of the disagreement remains unknown.Murdoch and Grosjean, pp.61-62. Hepburn was released by Gustav Adolf on the 10 July 1632. Nonetheless, Hepburn remained in the field and took part in the battle of 24 August near Nurnberg as an observer (The Swedish Intelligencer describes his status there as being simply a volunteer).Monro, His Expedition, vol. 2, p. 148; The Swedish Intelligencer. The Third Part, pp. 44-5. Thereafter Hepburn and a few other Scottish officers - Sir James Hamilton of Priestfield among them - returned to Scotland. On 26 January 1633 Hepburn received his first commission from the French government. King Charles I's warrant for Hepburn's levy of 1200 men dates from 26 March and the entry in the Privy Council records dates from 24 April.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, second series, vol. 5, p. 65. 23 April 1633 (the original royal warrant was dated 28 March 1633) Hepburn raised 2000 men in Scotland for French service, and was in command at the conquest of Lorraine and at the siege of Nancy. He continued his successful career, in Alsace and at the taking of de La Mothe castle in 1634. Hepburn was in charge of 6000 men at this time gaining the rank of Marechal de Camp.Anon., The Modern History of the World, part I, pp. 8, 11, 15; Clanché, Sir John Hepburn, Maréchal de France, pp. 20-2; Murdoch and Grosjean, p.65. He then served in Germany under Marshal La Force, de Breze, and cardinal de la Valette, eventually joining with Duke Bernhard of Weimar's army in 1635. By March that year, the author of The Modern History of the World noted Hepburn as Field Marshal for the king of France's army. The rank did not exist as such, but his title was Marschal de Camp. He was soon after awarded the rank of Marshal of France while on campaign, though he died before he hard the news of his levation.Clanché, Sir John Hepburn, Maréchal de France, p.25; Murdoch and Grosjean, p.74. During this period, Hepburn acted as an intermediary between the Swedes and the French military commanders. By this juncture his Régiment de Hebron had at its head three senior officers: the Colonel, Sir John Hepburn, Lieutenant-Colonel Munro, and Major Sir Patrick Monteith. It included 45 Captains, 1 Lieutenant-Captain, 45 Lieutenants, 48 Ensigns, 4 surgeons, 6 adjutants, 2 chaplains, 1 drum-major, 1 piper, 88 sergeants 288 corporals, 288 lance-corporals, 96 drummers and 48 companies each consisting of 150 musketeers and pikemen, totalling some 8,316 men.For this breakdown see Clanché, Sir John Hepburn, p. 24. On either the 8 or 21 July 1636 Hepburn was killed by a gun shot wound to the neck during the siege of Saverne.Clanché, Sir John Hepburn, Maréchal de France, pp.11, 30. John was buried along with his sword, helmet and spurs in the cathedral at Toul Cathedral in France. A monument, since destroyed, was erected there on the western side of the left transept. He appears not to have married or to have fathered any children. Andrew Hepburn, claiming to be the brother German of both Colonel Sir John and Lieutenant Colonel Sir James Hepburn, petitioned the Scottish Privy Council in July 1636 for the right to claim their property and goods as the sole surviving heir. Hepburn's French regiment, Régiment d’Hebron, later morphed into the modern Royal Scots regiment of the British army.

He resided in Nin and was the ruler of most of the Croats in northern Dalmatia.John Van Antwerp Fine: The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century, 1991, p. 255 Borna's predecessor was Višeslav of Croatia, most probably his father. After his death in 821, he was succeeded by his nephew Vladislav. He is mentioned in the Royal Frankish Annals (Annales regni Francorum) in entries regarding 818–821. His titles were \\"Duke of the Guduscani\\" (a Croatian tribe from Lika and northern Dalmatia) in 818; \\"Duke of Dalmatia\\" in 819; \\"Duke of Dalmatia and Liburnia\\" in 821. Historiography treats him as a ruler of Dalmatian Croatia.  History  Map showing imperial boundaries in 814, with Croatia as tributary to Charlemagne. Borna is documented in the \\"Royal Frankish Annals\\" (Annales regni Francorum). He is first mentioned regarding an 818 meeting at Herstal of Frankish Emperor Louis the Pious with envoys of the Obotrites, Borna (duke of the Guduscani), and of the Timociani, who had recently revolted against the Bulgars and switched sides to the Franks, and also Ljudevit (duke of Pannonian Croatia), the commander of the March of Friuli. Historiography predominantly treats the Guduscani as a tribe in Lika, along the river Gacka. In July 819, another Frankish assembly was held at Ingelheim, and because of Ljudevit's rebellion against the Franks, Frankish troops were sent from Italy to Pannonia, but returned without accomplishment. Ljudevit sent envoys to the Franks with conditions that were not accepted by the Frankish emperor; Ljudevit continued the rebellion and sent envoys to neighbouring tribes to join him, managing to win over the Timociani who had initially submitted to the Franks. A small Frankish army clashed with Ljudevit's army in Carinthia, destroyed much of it and drove it out. Borna, now the \\"Duke of Dalmatia\\", with a large army met Ljudevit's advancing army on the Kupa river. The Guduscani deserted Borna at the first encounter, but he fled safely with his bodyguard. During this battle, Dragomuž (Dragomosus), Ljudevit's father-in-law who had joined Borna with the outbreak of the rebellion, fell. Borna conquered the Guduscani again after they had returned home. In December, Ljudevit used the opportunity to attack Dalmatia with a large army, ravaging the country. Borna attacked Ljudevit with crack troops, after storing as much as he could in his castles, seeing that he was no match for him. Worn down, attacked in the rear and flank, with heavy losses, Ljudevit was forced to retreat from Borna's territory. Ljudevit had 3,000 lost soldiers, and Borna seized more than 300 horses, and spoils of all kinds, then informed the Frankish emperor through his envoys of this. In January 820 another Frankish assembly was held in Aachen. It was decided that Ljudevit's rebellion be quelled with three armies from three directions. Borna offered his opinions on the operation, first through envoys and then in person. In springtime, the three armies were dispatched, the first from Italy through the Noric Alps, the second through Carinthia, the third from Bavaria through Upper Pannonia. The first and third moved slowly, one hindered by enemies and the other by the long route, while the second crossed the Drava, successfully overcoming three enemy encounters, moving fast. The armies united and ravaged the land, and returned home without significant losses, while Ljudevit had stayed safe in a mountainous castle. Carniola, on the border with Friuli, and the Carinthians that had defected from the Franks to Ljudevit, surrendered to the Franks. In February 821 another Frankish assembly was held in Aachen. War against Ljudevit was planned, with three armies to ravage lands of traitors. Meanwhile, Borna, now mentioned as the \\"Duke of Dalmatia and Liburnia\\", died, and was succeeded by his nephew (by his sister), Vladislav, by the people's will and emperor's approval. Ljudevit's lands were ravaged, the armies returning home by October. Historiography There are differing views over Borna's tribal belonging and regnal title in historiography. A. K. Miošić (1801) called him a \\"Dalmatian king\\" (kragl Dalmatinski) and then \\"Slavic king\\" (kragl Slovinskii). A. Dimitz called him \\"Duke of the Dalmatian Slavs\\". Croatian historiography treats him as a ruler of \\"Dalmatian Croatia\\": V. Klaić (1886) called him a \\"White Croatian duke\\" that later became the \\"Duke of Dalmatian Croats\\". F. Šišić (1920) deemed him a \\"Dalmatian-Croatian duke\\". A. P. Vlasto (1970) called him a \\"Dalmatian Croat\\" ruler, and believed he was at least nominally Christian. T. Macan (1971) called him a \\"duke of the southern Croatian duchy\\". I. Perić (1997) called him a \\"Croatian-Dalmatian duke\\". Similarly, Croatian historian Neven Budak also mentions him as \\"first known Croatian duke\\". R. Novaković (1973) does not support that he was a duke of Dalmatian Croatia, as no contemporary sources name him as such. According to him, Borna could only be the duke of that area that was at the time under Frankish supreme rule, and that he was active only in the area included in the rebellion against Frankish rule, that is, only west of the Una river. It is possible that Borna was the duke of an archonty not yet part of Croatia in the beginning of the 9th century, neither was Croatia at all included in the events of Ljudevit's rebellion. The war was fought only in the area under Frankish rule, while Dalmatian Croatia was outside those events, as it at that time was under Byzantine supreme rule. M. Atlagić and B. Milutinović (2002) treat him as a Dalmatian Slavic ruler. Another view is that it seems that after the Timociani did not receive aid, a part of them settled in Slavonia, it seems also that Borna moved with them; S. Prvanović (1962) viewed him as a duke from Timok- Kučevo that founded the first Croatian state, while M. S. Milojević (1872) treated him as a Frankish vassal in \\"Littoral Croatia\\" that originally held three counties in the Timok region. Prvanović claimed that F. Racki had falsified the RFA, that Borna actually was the duke of Guduscani and Timociani, combined, and that Racki had put a comma after Guduscani, based on the identification with Gacka in Lika and presumption that due to the geographical distance between the two meant that the two could not have had nearer contact nor a joint duke. Prvanović was not the first to put the Guduscani in the Timok region; 19th-century P. J. Šafárik and V. Karić located them around the Timok and Danube. Fine Jr. first (1983, 1991) called him a ruler of \\"Dalmatian Croatia\\", in c. 810–821, having succeeded Višeslav and \\"who resided at Nin and seems to have been the ruler of most of the Croatians in northern Dalmatia, was also a Frankish Vassal.\\" then (2010) called him simply a Slavic prince, and also noted that the Franks did not use the term \\"Croats\\", suggesting that those usually called Croats in scholarship did not actually use that name. B. W. Scholz (1970) uses the original titles found in the primary source, and in the index uses \\"duke of Dalmatia\\". R. McKitterick (1983) called him a \\"leader of the Dalmatian Croats\\". C. R. Bowlus (1995) treated him as the \\"dux of the Guduscani and Timocian Slavs\\" and a \\"Dalmatian prince\\". F. Curta (2006) treats him as a Slavic ruler, of the Guduscani, a Slavic tribe in the Gacka region (modern Croatia). Garipzanov, Geary and Urbańczyk (2008) call him \\"Duke of Dalmatia and Liburnia\\". = Identification with other rulers = Marquart, in Osteuropäische u. ostasiatische Streifzöge (1903), identified De Administrando Imperio's Porinos and Porga with Borna. Krumbacher (1906) supported that Porinos and Borna were the same, but not Porga. However, on the mere basis of the chronology of arrival and baptism in the 7th century, as well the non-Slavic origin of personal names of early Croatian rulers in the 7th century, Porga could not be Borna or Branimir (r. 879–892), with whom some scholars tried to identify him with.  Titles  In the Royal Frankish Annals Borna is named \\"Duke of the Guduscani\\" () in 818.Annales regni Francorum DCCCXVIII (year 818) In 819 he is the \\"Duke of Dalmatia\\" (),; Ann. Reg. Fr. MGH, SS, I, 206 while in 821 he is the \\"Duke of Dalmatia and Liburnia\\" ().; Ann. Reg. Fr. MGH, SS, I, 207 The gradual ascent of his title should be due to his growing importance during the Frankish conflict with Ljudevit.

It is one in a series of Microsoft technologies that began in 1990 with the first version of Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) for 16-bit Windows. Intermediate steps in the development of these technologies were Component Object Model (COM) released in 1993 and updated in 1995 as COM-95, Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM), released in 1997 (and renamed Active X), and COM+ with its Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS), released in 2000. It is now superseded by Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), which is part of the .NET Framework 3.0. Like its family members and similar technologies such as Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) and Java's remote method invocation (RMI), .NET Remoting is complex, yet its essence is straightforward. With the assistance of operating system and network agents, a client process sends a message to a server process and receives a reply. Overview .NET Remoting allows an application to make an object (termed remotable object) available across remoting boundaries, which includes different appdomains, processes or even different computers connected by a network. The .NET Remoting runtime hosts the listener for requests to the object in the appdomain of the server application. On the client end, any requests to the remotable object are proxied by the .NET Remoting runtime over \`Channel\` objects, that encapsulate the actual transport mode, including TCP streams, HTTP streams and named pipes. As a result, by instantiating proper \`Channel\` objects, a .NET Remoting application can be made to support different communication protocols without recompiling the application. The runtime itself manages the act of serialization and marshalling of objects across the client and server appdomains. .NET Remoting makes a reference of a remotable object available to a client application, which then instantiates and uses a remotable object as if it were a local object. However, the actual code execution happens at the server-side. A remotable object is identified by Activation URLs and are instantiated by a connection to the URL. A listener for the object is created by the remoting runtime when the server registers the channel that is used to connect to the remotable object. At the client side, the remoting infrastructure creates a \`proxy\` that stands-in as a pseudo-instantiation of the remotable object. It does not implement the functionality of the remotable object, but presents a similar interface. As such, the remoting infrastructure needs to know the public interface of the remotable object beforehand. Any method calls made against the object, including the identity of the method and any parameters passed, are serialized to a byte stream and transferred over a communication protocol-dependent \`Channel\` to a recipient proxy object at the server side (\\"marshalled\\"), by writing to the Channel's transport sink. At the server side, the proxy reads the stream off the sink and makes the call to the remotable object on the behalf of the client. The results are serialized and transferred over the sink to the client, where the proxy reads the result and hands it over to the calling application. If the remotable object needs to make a callback to a client object for some services, the client application must mark it as remotable and have a remoting runtime host a listener for it. The server can connect to it over a different Channel, or over the already existent one if the underlying connection supports bidirectional communication. A channel can be composed of a number of different Channel objects, possibly with different heterogeneous transports. Thus, remoting can also work across systems separated by an interconnection of heterogeneous networks, including the internet. Type safety is enforced by the CTS and the .NET Remoting runtime. Remote method calls are inherently synchronous; asynchronous calls can be implemented using threading libraries. Authentication and access control can be implemented for clients by either using custom Channels or by hosting the remotable objects in IIS and then using the IIS authentication system.

Since 1 January 2016, it is part of Essarts- en-Bocage.  Geography  The town of Les Essarts is located between the A83 and the A87 freeways, between La Roche sur Yon and Les Herbiers, 55 km from les Sables d'Olonne and 30 km from Le Puy du Fou.  History  The city was built at the Roman period. At the Middle Ages, there was a lord in the middle of the town, and a fort was built. During the war in the Vendée, on 25 June 1795, a battle took place in the Les Essarts fort. Charette hired Louis Pageot, one of his lieutenants, to surprise the garrison of Les Essarts. 300 republicans were caught, and then shot after the execution of 748 chouans. During World War II, Germans occupied the Moulin de l'Ansonnière.  Demography  In 2008, Les Essarts counted 4946 inhabitants (an 18% raise comparing to 1999). In 1800, date people started to record the number of inhabitants there, there was 1844 inhabitants in the town.  Sights  = Historical Places = The Old Castle : The story of the castle starts at the Roman period, according to research made in 1935, which led to the creation of a « Suovetaurilia » : a sacrificial altar dedicated to March. Then, the first fort in Les Essarts (a wooden castle) was made at the feudal period. Starting from the 18th century, lords living around started to build a castle in stone. During the war in the Vendée (1793–1796, counterrevolution in the Vendée region of France during the French Revolution) the castle was partly destroyed. Descendants of the Lespinay and De Rougé families still own it. The St Pierre Church: The St Pierre Church was built in the 19th century. Before that a Roman church was at this place, built in the 11th and 12th centuries. It was burnt during the war in the Vendée by the Republican forces. The entrance of the previous church still exists, it has been transported stone by stone in the castle’s park. The Crypt: The crypt, located near from the sacristy, was built in the 12th century. It is referenced as a historical monument since 1971. The previous train station: In 1898, a railroad was built to link Cholet to Les Sables d’Olonne. Between La Roche sur Yon and Les Herbiers, there was the Les Essarts train station. The train disappeared in Les Essarts in 1950 and has been restored as a place to live. L’Ansonnière Mill: It is one of the last Mill that we could found before in this town. In 1926, Alcide Gautron stopped his activity. During WWII, German people occupied it and transformed it in an observatory point. In 1992, the Mill was bought by the town hall and restored.  Clubs  The town of Les Essarts has various associations with diverse goals. Thus, you can find sport clubs, like Les Korrigans dancing club, the soccer team, or the basketball team, cultural and leisure clubs, like a music club etc. Some clubs are working in the agricultural world, others in the social world, like Telethon. Also, some clubs are representing the military or the education. The town of Les Essarts is also the headquarters of the cycling team Vendée U Pays de la Loire, and of the professional cycling team Europcar (the leader of this team, Thomas Voeckler, ended up being 4th at the end of the Tour de France in 2011).  Events  The town of Les Essarts was a stage city of the Tour de France in 2005 and in 2011. First, Les Essarts was the ending town of the 2nd stage of the Tour de France 2005, which was linking Challans to Les Essarts. Then, on 3 July 2011, the 2nd stage of the Tour de France 2011, a team-time trial which had Les Essarts as a starting and an ending point! The departure was in the Old Castle, then they went to Boulogne, Dompierre-sur-Yon and La Merlatière, and came back to les Essarts.  Partnerships with other towns  Les Essarts has a partnership with Neunkirchen-Seelscheid in Germany since 1991 and with Bicester in the United Kingdom since 1992. Neunkirchen-Seelscheid is located in the Land Nordrhein-Westfalen, near from Cologne, and Bicester in the Oxford region.

The adhesive's grip was strong enough to hold papers together, but weak enough to allow the papers to be pulled apart again without being torn. It could also be used again and again. The adhesive was patented in 1972 and described as suitable for use as a spray. In 1974, Art Fry attended an internal seminar at 3M held by Spencer Silver, who was promoting his adhesive's properties. Fry regarded it as a potential solution to a practical challenge, that of preventing paper bookmarks from falling out of his hymnal when he sang in church. Fry developed bookmarks using Silver's adhesive, preventing them from leaving residue, and sought to interest others within the 3M company in them. The adhesive notes were initially marketed under the name Post 'n Peel in four cities from 1977 and as Post-it Notes from 1980 throughout the United States. The product became very popular and has been sold worldwide since. Silver worked at 3M until he retired in 1996. He is named in over 20 US patents. Spencer Silver has received several awards for his work, including the 1998 American Chemical Society Award for Creative Invention and induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2010.

Work started on what would become the Iryda during 1976 as a successor to the indigenously- developed TS-11 Iskra jet trainer. First flying on 3 March 1985, the type would have a protracted development, partly due to the initial unavailability of its PZL K-15 turbojet engines. The Polish Air Force received the first K-15-powered Irydras during May 1995. However, aircraft deliveries were complicated due to disputes over cost and performance, leading to multiple announcements, policy reversals, and groundings of the type. A fatal accident involving the type on 24 January 1996 fuelled criticism and undermined support for the programme. During 1996, an agreement was struck to upgrade the existing aircraft to a new standard, flight testing of which commenced during the following year. However, relations between PZL Mielec and the Polish Defense Ministry became so poor over the programme that legal action was initiated while the Iryda itself languished. During the late 1990s, Polish Government support for the programme was withdrawn, and the handful of delivered aircraft were stored. Despite attempts to revive the programme by PZL Mielec, no orders have been forthcoming. Development =Early work= In 1976, the Warsaw Institute of Aeronautics (Polish: Instytut Lotnictwa) initiated work on a program to develop a new jet-powered trainer aircraft; this was primarily envisioned to replace the Polish Air Force's existing TS-11 Iskra fleet, an indigenously-developed first generation jet trainer aircraft. A key feature of the new type would be its PZL K-15 turbojet engines, which were also locally designed by the Warsaw Institute of Aeronautics. Subsequently dubbed Iryda, the aircraft was designed by PZL Mielec (then WSK- Mielec). On 3 March 1985, the first prototype conducted the type's maiden flight. Early examples of the type were powered by a pair of PZL-5s, an older generation turbojet engine; these were considered to be underpowered and were only intended as a temporary measure while issues with the newer K-15 were being resolved. Following the Revolutions of 1989, Poland soon gained greater accessibility to international markets; this had an impact upon the fledgling Iryda. It was chosen to adopt a British-developed Martin-Baker Mk.10 ejection seat; consideration was reportedly given to the incorporation of foreign- sourced avionics from French aeronautics company SAGEM. During May 1995, the first pair of M-93K Irydas were delivered to the Polish Air Force; these were intended to be the production-standard version of the type. Unlike the five preceding units of the type that had been previously handed over, the M-93K model was powered by the PZL K-15 engines instead of the older PZL-5 units which had been adopted as an interim powerplant. Amongst other benefits, the more powerful K-15 engines almost doubled the Iryda's payload capacity. The K-15 engine was not considered to be a likely candidate for export sales of the Iryda; British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce was at one stage working with PZL to certify its Viper engine to power the type. =Controversy and curtailment= While the Polish Armed Forces were heavily impacted by curtailed budgets during the 1990s, the service intended to take delivery of five M-93K aircraft by the end of 1995, while plans for purchasing an additional six-to-eight Irydas were publicly mooted. At the time, there was an acknowledged desire for \\"around 40\\" jet trainers; the Polish Navy had also sought new trainer aircraft at this time. On 1 December 1995, the Polish Government announced that the Polish Air Force would purchase no further aircraft due to it being too costly to continue. The Iryda's chief designer, Marek Potapowicz, openly stated that the programme's loss could lead to the collapse of PZL Mielec. That same month, a rival plan to procure second-hand Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jets for the Polish Air Force was officially suspended; the negative impact on Polish industry was apparently a major contributing factor to this decision. Nevertheless, competing trainers, including the Alpha Jet, Saab 105, and Aero L-39 Albatros, were demonstrated to Polish officials. PZL Mielec offered several improvements for the Iryda, including various aerodynamic improvements, such as leading-edge root extensions and trailing edge flaps, along with a costly SAGEM-sourced avionics suite. During January 1996, funding was redirected by the Polish Government to support the Iryda programme; this was to not only to acquire additional aircraft but to finance upgrades to both the avionics and the engines. The prior month's decision to terminate the programme's backing had reportedly been overruled by Prime Minister Jozef Oleksy. According to aerospace industry periodical Flight International, Polish Air Force officials at one point were claiming the Iryda fleet to have achieved the highest serviceability statistics in the air force's inventory. However, Colonel Janusz Karpowicz of the Deblin pilot- training school criticised the Iryda for possessing longitudinally \\"heavy\\" controls, a relatively high approach speed, and the capability of its avionics. In February 1996, the Polish Air Force grounded its Iryda fleet and froze its orders for the type following a fatal accident on 24 January of that year. The accident, which was reportedly the result of a trim-related issue, and its investigation became highly politicised. During March 1996, the Warsaw Institute of Aeronautics abandoned development of its new D-18A engine, which was intended to power future combat-orientated versions of the Iryda, reportedly due to market viability concerns. In April 1996, the programme was officially resumed in response to a fresh order from the Polish Air Force, which involved the purchase of six new-build aircraft and the retrofitting of 11 existing aircraft in air force service with improved engines, avionics and wings by 1998. During October 1996, PZL-Mielec stated that it aimed for an upgraded prototype to be flown prior to the end of the year; the company also had ambitions to secure a follow-on order in the coming year, as well as for an modified maritime reconnaissance/strike version that were envisioned to replace the Polish Navy's fleet of MiG-21bis fighters. In June 1997, an Iryda flew for the first time with both the upgraded avionics package and the aerodynamic improvements. Full-scale flight testing of the upgraded aircraft was reportedly set to commence during August of that year; it was anticipated that the upgrade would be certified during 1998, after which the Polish Air Force would commence operational use of the type. =Cancellation and relaunch efforts= Relations between PZL-Meilec and the Polish Defense Ministry broke down during the latter half of 1997, cumulating in the company opting to file a law suit against the ministry over its alleged failure to honour the terms of a contract pertaining to the Iryda. While PZL-Meilec claimed that the Defense Ministry had demanded additional unfunded factory testing, the ministry accused the company of \\"negligence\\", and that the aircraft lacked necessary quality-control certification to be deemed safe for test flights. The prototype was grounded while legal action ensured. The Polish Air Force's procurement of the Iryda was formally cancelled during 1998, allegedly in response to the development difficulties experienced as well as the protracted shortage of funding that was common around this period; a key event that had reportedly contributing to its cancellation was the fatal crash in 1996. During the summer of 2002, PZL-Mielec relaunched development of the type, resuming flights of the Iryda on 22 July of that year, while attempting to gain interest and secure orders. Dubbed Iskra 2, it received a new Thales- supplied avionics suite and featured underwing hard points to enable the carriage of armaments, external fuel tanks, and other equipment.

He left it and returned to England in 1701, where he died penniless in 1718. Following his departure and financial woes the estate fell into numerous hands and disrepair. Since 1939 it has been the name of a reconstructed manor on the original property. Penn had his manor built on an parcel, part of his much larger grant of land from the Crown. It was located about 25 miles north of Philadelphia along the Delaware River in present-day Falls Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. In 1929 the Pennsylvania legislature authorized acquisition of the property by gift. In 1932 the Warner Company donated nearly ten acres of the property to the state of Pennsylvania as a site for a permanent memorial to Penn. The Pennsylvania Historical Commission was given responsibility for it. The legislature appropriated money to reconstruct the buildings of this estate in a historically accurate manner, to create a house museum in 1939. Over the decades, more land was acquired, and the property now has a total of . The property was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 28, 1969. The manor house and grounds are administered by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission in association with The Pennsbury Society, and are open to the public.Pennsbury Manor official website History William Penn (1644-1718) of England, the new Proprietor of the King's Grant for the Province of Pennsylvania, traveled to the New World of \\"The Americas\\" in 1682 to start his dream of a \\"Holy Experiment\\" free from religious persecution for his \\"Religious Society of Friends\\" (\\"Quakers\\"). He was granted an tract by King Charles II of England. Penn met with the local Native American Lenape tribes to negotiate fairly and sue for peace, seeking not merely their blessing but cooperation in settling the land. He achieved amicable relations and platted the village of Philadelphia north of the confluence of the large southerly flowing Delaware River and easterly Schuylkill, a smaller tributary entering from the northwest. The manor of Pennsbury, a summer home for Penn and his family, was established along the Delaware twenty-five miles north of Philadelphia, between the river's west bank and what was later named Van Sciver Lake. Construction was begun soon after his arrival in the Colony in 1682 and completed around 1686. In addition to the central manor house, separate outbuildings for baking and brewing, a large stable, boathouse, and numerous farm buildings were erected. Penn's plan was to establish the sort of gentleman's country estate similar to his home in England. Penn spent most of his time in the soon-to-be capital city of Philadelphia governing his settlement, leaving the manor house empty for long periods of time. From 1699 to 1701, he rented \\"The Slate Roof House\\" in Philadelphia as his second residence and city townhouse. He left the colony for England in 1701 to fend off a threatening French claim to his British grant, dying destitute in his home town or Ruscombe after having been defrauded by his English agent of rents and income due him. By 1736, one of Penn's sons remarked that the Pennsbury house \\"was very near falling, the roof open as well as the windows and the woodwork almost rotten.\\" It remained in family hands until 1792.P. L. Hudson, \\"Pennsbury Manor: The Philosopher’s Garden\\", Pennsylvania Heritage Magazine, Number 4, Fall 1994; posted at Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. At some time before 1820 a farmhouse today known as the Crozier House was built over part of the original Pennsbury foundations. It still stands on the larger property but was moved. The Warner Company of Philadelphia, established in 1794 as a dealer in sand, gravel and other construction materials, acquired much of the otherwise deserted land where the manor once stood. In 1932, on the 250th anniversary of Penn's arrival, the company donated some of the lands to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Charles Warner, its president, presented the deed for a just under ten-acre parcel where the Pennsbury buildings had stood to the state as a permanent memorial to Penn. The Pennsylvania Historical Commission was given responsibility for what was then known as The Pennsbury Memorial.Hayward Dare Warner, \\"A Warner Family Narrative\\", 1971 (self-published); posted by Christopher H. Wynkoop, 2004 copyright, Freepages, Rootsweb Site discovery and reconstruction In the 1920s and 1930s there was considerable interest in preserving buildings and history of colonial America, due in part to the country's celebration of its sesquicentennial and the stresses of waves of immigration, a world war, and the Great Depression. Sites relating to Founding Fathers were reconstructed in this era, notably Abraham Lincoln's former home in New Salem, Illinois, in the 1920s and the long-destroyed northern Virginia birthplace of George Washington, Wakefield, in 1930.\\" Also in Virginia the Rockefeller family supported the restoration and reconstruction of Colonial Williamsburg. At that time, the commission, Commonwealth, and other sources collaborated to construct a colonial revival manor house and outbuildings at Pennsbury, as a home for a house museum dedicated to Penn. Completed in 1940, it is operated as Pennsbury Manor by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission in association with The Pennsbury Society, a non-profit organization, and is open to the public. Additional acreage has been acquired enlarging the site . The manor and grounds were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. =Reconstruction= Penn wrote to his overseer James Harrison frequently from England during the construction of the estate, providing insight into his intentions and progress of the project. During its early years of ownership the Pennsylvania Historical Commission conducted site mapping, archaeology, and documentary research. In 1934 historian Albert Cook Myers found the buried foundations of the house and a crude drawing on an eighteenth-century survey map. These served as the basis for recreating a typical red-brick manor house on the property. Pennsbury Manor was designed by local architect R. Brognard Okie, (1875-1945), known for his sensitive Colonial Revival constructions in the area, and restoration of the Betsy Ross House in Philadelphia. It appears to today's analysts that he designed a larger and more elaborate house than the original Pennsbury, believed to have been based on a T-shape. Pennsbury Manor was built 1938–1940. Okie's design decisions drew from other properties of that period in nearby Pennsylvania, asserting that Pennsbury probably influenced their design.William Woys Weaver and Nancy D. Kolb, \\"Okie Speaks for Pennsbury\\", Pennsylvania Heritage, Parts I and II, Fall 1982 and Winter 1983 issues, respectively The result is two stories, with a dormered hipped roof serving as an attic. The design is Georgian influenced Colonial Revival, five bays wide and two piles deep. A white wooden door and windows contrast against red brick laid in a Flemish bond. Support buildings in either matching brick or whitewashed wood frames surround the home. Early anachronisms that were part of the original construction project, such as a white picket fence and brick walkways, have been replaced by more appropriate styles of pale fencing and graveled walks. Bricks were too expensive at the time of Pennsbury Manor's original construction to be used for walkways, and not even the original house was fully constructed in brick. Since the late 20th century the museum staff has concentrated their attentions indoors, creating an increasingly accurate depiction of domestic life in Penn's time through interpretive programs and such decorative elements as period appropriate wall colors, textiles, and furniture arrangements.\\"Mark Reinberger and Elizabeth McLean, \\"Pennsbury Manor: Reconstruction and Reality\\", PENNSYLVANIA MAGAZINE OF HISTORY AND BIOGRAPHY, Vol. CXXXI, No. 3 (July 2007) Okie did not get the final contract for the landscape, but had submitted a proposal. Historic horticulture was little developed at this time, and architect Thomas Sears' (1880-1960) design once again owed more to Colonial Revival than actual Colonial, \\" featuring numerous plants only brought from Asia in the 19th century such as Weigela, Kerria japonica, Forsythia, and Chinese Wisteria. The brick bordered \\"colonial\\" herb garden was also a 19th-century design element.

Addison reported his findings in a paper titled, \\"On the anatomical topography of the abdominal viscera in man, especially the gastro-intestinal canal\\" in which he established a baseline for the anatomy of the abdomen based on the arrangement of the map of the Earth. Using the suprasternal notch as the North Pole of the trunk, and the upper border of the pubic symphysis as the South Pole, he drew a vertical line joining these two points as his meridian. At the meridian's midpoint, he then drew a perpendicular line corresponding to the Equator. As this transverse plane crossed the pylorus, he called it the transpyloric plane.

Clifton Park Museum is located in Clifton House and one of several publicly owned museums and visitor attractions administered by the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham. The house is the headquarters of Heritage Services, which also includes the York and Lancaster Regimental Museum and Archives and Local Studies. It is a Grade II* listed building. Clifton Park is a visitor attraction with facilities including a skate park, rockery, memorial park and children's play areas. It is also Grade II listed with Historic England.  History  1758 soldier's uniform in the York and Lancaster Regimental Museum Clifton House was designed by John Carr of York for Joshua Walker, an industrialist involved in the manufacture of iron and steel, and completed in 1784. The grounds of the house now comprising the park originally had walled gardens, pleasure grounds, and a fishpond, however they have mostly been lost due to later park changes. The house and park were purchased by the Municipal Borough of Rotherham in 1891 and the museum was first opened to the public later that year with the majority of its exhibits loaned by local people. It was administered by the Borough Librarian with a succession of honorary curators until the 1970s. In 1974 the soot blackened stonework was cleaned and the museum building was extended when a roof was placed over the original open courtyard.  Clifton Park Museum  Rockingham Pottery The museum In 2003 the museum closed for a major refurbishment of the building and displays, partly funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund. During this time it was twice shortlisted for the Gulbenkian Prize for Museum of the Year in 2003 and 2004, for its innovative outreach programmes, despite the building being closed to the public. The refurbishment cost £3 million in total and included major repairs to the roof, heating systems, stonework, windows and electrical systems. In addition to new displays, improved public facilities included a study room, a cafeteria and a gift shop. A lift was also installed to make the building fully accessible to disabled visitors. The interior was redecorated using the exact colour scheme as used when the building was a Georgian country house in the 18th century. Clifton Park Museum re-opened to the public on 29 January 2005. = York and Lancaster Regimental Museum = The York and Lancaster Regimental Museum is a separate museum located inside Clifton Park Museum and covers the history of the Regiment and its precursors the 65th and 84th Regiments of Foot. The displays have uniforms, equipment and guns from all periods of the history. = Collections = The museum collections include local social and industrial history, archaeology, natural sciences, coins and medals and fine and decorative arts. These include Roman remains from Templeborough, and Nelson, a stuffed Cape Lion. The museum is noted for its particularly fine collection of Rockingham Pottery, including one of only two specimens of porcelain 'Rhinoceros Vase', which were created as showcases of the work of the pottery.  Clifton Park  The memorial garden The park in which the museum sits is Grade II listed with Historic England so too are the gate piers at one of the entrances. Clifton Park was opened on 25 June 1891 by the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII. Between 1891 and 1893 changes were made to the grounds to add footpaths, entrances and facilities resulting in the original walled kitchen garden being demolished. In the 1830s a commemorative beech tree was planted for Queen Victoria's coronation. In 1900 the main entrance was added, the Cenotaph was added in 1922, and the Memorial Gardens in 1948. The park was given a Heritage Lottery Fund award with a value of £7.6m and between 2009 and 2011 new features such as the water play area was added. A new walled garden was built and has plots maintained by a variety of different groups. The memorial garden has floral displays and a central fountain which is engraved with the names of Rotherham's Victoria Cross holders. The rock garden includes a waterfall and ponds. A new garden house and courtyard was built and offers event spaces and toilets. The house garden has Japanese maples, bamboos and a yellow weigelia. = Facilities = In addition to the museum there is a landtrain, children's play area, mini golf, crazy golf, a sand pit, a wet splash area, a rock garden, a memorial garden, a skate park, a fun park, a bowling green, tennis courts, picnicking, walking and a bandstand. A Parkrun takes place in the park every Saturday morning.

Known as \\"the Pfalz,\\" this former stronghold is famous for its picturesque and unique setting. History The keep of this island castle, a pentagonal tower with its point upstream, was erected between 1326 and 1327 by King Ludwig the Bavarian. Around the tower, a defensive hexagonal wall was built between 1338 and 1340. In 1477 Pfalzgrafenstein was passed as deposit to the Count of Katzenelnbogen.http://www.graf-von-katzenelnbogen.de/ Pfalzgrafenstein, The History of the County of Katzenelnbogen and the First Riesling of the World Later additions were made in 1607 and 1755, consisting of corner turrets, the gun bastion pointing upstream, and the characteristic baroque tower cap. The castle functioned as a toll-collecting station that was not to be ignored. It worked in concert with Gutenfels Castle and the fortified town of Kaub on the right side of the river. Due to a dangerous cataract on the river's left, about a kilometer upstream, every vessel would have to use the fairway nearer to the right bank, thus floating downstream between the mighty fortress on the vessel's left and the town and castle on its right. A chain across the river drawn between those two fortifications forced ships to submit, and uncooperative traders could be kept in the dungeon until a ransom was delivered. The dungeon was a wooden float in the well. Unlike the vast majority of Rhine castles, \\"the Pfalz\\" was never conquered or destroyed, withstanding not only wars, but also the natural onslaughts of ice and floods by the river. Its spartan quarters held about twenty men. Extensive measures of waterway engineering in the nineteenth century, above all straightening the river for better use as an international waterway and along this particular stretch, clearing it from the old cataract, relocated the regularly used fairway from the river's right arm to its left. Thus the tactical advantage may not be apparent to one unaware of the change in the watercourse. The island of the castle was used for the Rhine crossing by 60,000 Prussian troops under Blücher in the winter of 1814 in his pursuit of Napoleon. \\"A ship of stone...\\" The castle was acquired by Prussia in 1866, and toll collections ceased in 1867. It continued to be used as a signal station for the river boat traffic for about another century. In 1946, the castle became the property of the State of Rhineland-Palatinate. Museum The State eventually turned \\"the Pfalz\\" into a museum and restored the color scheme of the baroque period. The museum reflects the conditions of the 14th century, and the visitor will not find modern amenities such as electricity or a lavatory. It is accessible to the public via a ferry service from nearby Kaub as long as river conditions permit. The area is part of the Rhine Gorge, a World Heritage site.

It is the second installment in the Hatchet series, but chronologically the third with Brian's Winter serving as an alternative second book. Plot Brian Robeson, a 13-year-old boy who spent 54 days surviving alone in the Canadian wilderness the previous summer, is hired by the government to again live in the woods with only two knives and surviving only by his wits, so the military can learn his survival techniques. Though reluctant at first, Brian eventually agrees. This time, Brian sets out for a remote Canadian location accompanied by Derek Holtzer, a government psychologist. Though the government stipulated the duo take emergency supplies, Brian insists they abandon everything but a knife and an emergency radio, saying that it would be impossible to eat bugs and sleep in the rain when a tent and prepared food is within reach. During their stay, things take a grim turn when their camp is struck by lightning, which knocks Derek into a coma and destroys the radio. Knowing that Derek will die of dehydration long before anyone finds them, Brian builds a raft in a desperate bid to navigate down the unknown river to the nearest inhabited point known as Brannock's Trading Post for emergency aid. The biggest problem is the trading post is 100 miles downriver. Despite rapids, the craft's unwieldiness, exhaustion, and a lack of geographical knowledge, they finally reach the trading post and Derek survives. After the two get back home, Derek buys Brian a canoe named The Raft as a thank you present.

Atop his helm is the canting crest of Calveley: A calf's head sable crowned argent Canting arms of Calveley: Argent, a fess gules between three calves passant sable Sir Hugh Calveley (died 23 April 1394) was an English knight and commander, who took part in the Hundred Years' War, gaining fame during the War of the Breton Succession and the Castilian Civil War. He held various military posts in Brittany and Normandy. He should not be confused with his nephew, also Sir Hugh Calveley, who died in June 1393 and was Member of Parliament for Rutland. Background Hugh Calveley was born the youngest son of David de Calveley of Lea, and his wife, Joanna. His name is frequently misspelt as Calverley, Caverle, Calvelegh, Kerverley, Calverlee, Calvyle, Kalvele, Calviley, and Calvile. The family held the manor of Calveley in Bunbury, Cheshire living in Calveley Hall. The Hall came into the possession of the Davenport family through marriage in 1369. Hugh was likely born at Lea Hall in Lea Newbold, formerly a civil parish, now in the parish of Aldford and Saighton in the Borough of Cheshire West and Chester. Lea Hall remained in the Calveley Family until 1714 and was demolished in about 1876.Historic England Estimates of the year of his birth range from 1315 to 1333. Calveley married an Aragonese princess, the Dna Constanza.W McColly Ph.D in his pamphlet Sir Hugh Calveley : A Reassessment The evidence is incontrovertible, as there is a letter of 1377 in existence from Pedro IV on the subject of her dower. How long they cohabited if at all is a moot point but it is known that the princess left Calveley.The date when she left him is unknown but Pedro wrote to his son Martin in 1381 ordering him to stop living in adultery with Constanza.Ibid p.233 It is possible that he was a close relative, maybe even a half-brother, of Sir Robert Knolles. Breton civil war Along with many other Englishmen, the young Hugh Calveley served in Brittany, supporting Jean de Montfort's English-backed bid to become Duke of Brittany against the French-backed claimant, Charles de Blois, during the Breton War of Succession. An anonymous Breton poet's account of the Battle of the Thirty in 1351 has \\"Hue de Caverle\\" as a knight fighting on the English side (where he was defeated, captured, to be ransomed later). One estimate of the date of his knighthood is 1346, though documents from 1354 do not refer to him as a knight, and there is some evidence that he was only knighted later, in 1361. In 1354, Calveley was captain of the English-held fortress of Becherel. He planned a raid on the castle of Montmuran on 10 April, to capture Arnoul d'Audrehem, Marshal of France, who was a guest of the lady of Tinteniac. Bertrand du Guesclin, in one of the early highlights of his career, anticipated the attack, posting archers as sentries. When the sentries raised the alarm at Calveley's approach, both du Guesclin and d'Audrehem hurried to intercept. In the ensuing fight, Calveley was unhorsed by a knight named Enguerrand d'Hesdin, captured, and later ransomed. In 1359 Sir Robert Knolles and Calveley invaded the Rhône Valley. The city of Le Puy fell to them in July. The campaign ended when their way to Avignon was barred by the army of Thomas de la Marche, Deputy for Louis II, Duke of Bourbon, at which point both English commanders retreated. At the Battle of Auray on 29 September 1364, Calveley had the command of the reserve division of the forces of Jean de Montfort, under the command of Sir John Chandos. Charles de Blois was killed at Auray, enabling Jean de Montfort to claim the Duchy without further conflict. The Iberian Campaigns After the conclusion of the Breton civil war, Calveley, along with many other soldiers, found himself unemployed. These soldiers, banding together in the Free Companies, continued to support themselves by raiding widely, causing a huge problem for the Kingdom of France. The solution to the problem was found when Aragon, France and the Papacy agreed to provide money to pay for the Free Companies to wage a campaign to support Count Enrique of Trastamara's bid for the throne of Castile, which at the time was held by Enrique's half-brother, Pedro of Castile. Calveley signed up as the most prominent of the English captains on this campaign, in which he was involved from 1365 to 1367, ironically serving alongside Bertrand du Guesclin, his once and future enemy. For his services to Enrique, he was made Count of Carrion. He married one of the Aragonese queen's ladies-in-waiting, named Constanza, daughter of a Sicilian baron. Pedro the Cruel, having fled from Castile, invoked his alliance with England. Calveley was ordered back to the service of England by the Black Prince, and now took prominent part in Pedro's counter-campaign, culminating in the decisive Battle of Nájera. At Nájera, Calveley was once again in the rearguard, sharing command with Count Jean I of Armagnac. The two commanders had the glory of delivering the final blow to the faltering enemy infantry by a cavalry charge. Enrique of Trastamara escaped from the battle. Though his title as Count of Carrion had been granted by Enrique, Pedro confirmed it upon reclaiming the Castilian throne. In the spring of 1367, the Black Prince sent Calveley as an emissary to Aragon, to arrange the diplomatic isolation of the fugitive Enrique. Calveley successfully convinced Pedro the Ceremonious to renounce his support for Enrique. Resumed war with France When hostilities resumed between England and France in 1369, Calveley was once again involved, first in raiding the possessions of Gascon nobles who had defected to the French. He took part in at least three further campaigns in the period to 1374; notably, he was one of the joint commanders of the English army disastrously defeated by Bertrand du Guesclin at the Battle of Pontvallain, 4 December 1370, though he managed to escape. From 1375 to 1378, Calveley was governor of Calais, an important port. Thereafter, he became one of the two Admirals of the English fleet, taking part in several sea battles. In July 1379, he was involved in a raid on Brittany led by Sir John Arundel, Marshal of England. On their return voyage, 20 ships and about 1000 men were lost at sea in a storm. Calveley was one of only 8 survivors. In 1383, he took part in the Norwich Crusade, preached by the Roman pope against his rival at Avignon, but this campaign turned into an embarrassing failure when France bribed a large number of the participants. Late career Calveley's final military engagement was in 1386, when he joined John of Gaunt in an unsuccessful campaign to secure the Castilian throne. In July 1388, he joined the English Peace Commissioners negotiating a truce with France. In his later life, he also served as a Justice of the Peace for Berkshire. Death and burial Calveley died without issue on St George's Day, 23 April 1394 (though some sources list his date of death as 1393).

He was born in Vlissingen in 1597 or 1599. Early in his career he was active against the Dunkirkers and was promoted to captain in 1624. That year he took service for the Zeeland Chamber of the Dutch West India Company (WIC), remaining there until 1636. He defeated four Spanish Galleons in 1626 when commander of a squadron of three ships taking or sinking three of them, he also repeatedly defeated the Dunkirk corsairs Banckert often fought together with Piet Hein with whom he attacked and captured the Portuguese settlement Salvador on the coast of Brazil in 1624 and as a Vice Admiral helped capture the Spanish treasure fleet in the Bay of Matanzas in 1628. Thanks to these and other feats he earned the nicknames \\"Scourge of the Marranos\\" (the latter word then being used as a pejorative nickname for the Spanish in general) and \\"Terror of the Portuguese\\". Having rejoined the navy he was promoted to Rear- Admiral on 3 May 1637, being a Vice-Admiral in the WIC not entailing an equivalent rank in the navy. From 1 October 1637 to 11 January 1638 he was a temporary Vice-Admiral. In 1639, again Rear-Admiral, he served under Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp and was present at the first skirmish (the Action of 18 September 1639) against a large Spanish fleet in the English Channel and the subsequent Battle of the Downs. He again came into the service of the WIC from 1645 until his death. He again attained the navy rank of temporary Vice-Admiral on 10 December 1646. In 1647 he once again set sail for the coast of Brazil and on the return voyage suddenly fell ill and died at sea. He was married to Adriana Janssen. One of his sons was the later famous Lieutenant-Admiral Adriaen Banckert, another captain Joost Banckert de Jonge who was killed at the Battle of Portland, a third captain Jan Banckert who was killed on the Delft in the Battle of Lowestoft.

It included the Crimean Peninsula and the mainland between the lower Dnieper River and the coasts of the Black Sea and Sea of Azov. It was formed after the Taurida Oblast was abolished in 1802 in the course of Paul I's administrative reform of the South-Western territories that had been annexed from the Crimean Khanate. The governorate's centre was the city of Simferopol. The province was named after the ancient Greek name of Crimea - Taurida. Administrative divisions The governorate was divided into eight counties (uyezds) and two gradonachalstva, three of them on the mainland: *Berdyansky Uyezd (Berdyansk – Бердянскъ) *Dneprovsky Uyezd (centre Aleshki – Алешки) *Melitopolsky Uyezd (Melitopol – Мелитополь) and five in Crimea: *Yevpatoriysky Uyezd (Yevpatoria – Евпаторiя) *Perekopsky Uyezd (Perekop – Перекопъ) *Simferopolsky Uyezd (Simferopol – Симферополь) *Feodosiysky Uyezd (Feodosiya – Ѳеодосiя) *Yaltinsky Uyezd (Yalta – Ялта) *City of Kerch (Yenikale – Керчь-Eникале) *City of Sevastopol – Севастополь Before 1820 the governorate consisted of seven counties that included Tmutarakan county on the Taman Peninsula across the Kerch Strait. Later were created Yalta and Berdyansk counties. In 1804–29 there also existed the gradonachalstvo of Feodosiya and in 1914 Yalta county became gradonachalstvo of Yalta. In 1917 the governorate was split, with most of its peninsular part forming the Crimean People's Republic, less the city of Sevastopol which remained the main naval base of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Republic, while the rest became part of Ukrainian People's Republic. The territory of the Ukrainian Republic was proclaimed by the Third Universal on The Third Universal in the archives of the Verkhovna Rada of the Tsentralna Rada encompassing the Volyn Governorate, Kiev Governorate, Podolie Governorate, Chernigov Governorate, Poltava Governorate, Kharkov Governorate, Yekaterinoslav Governorate, Kherson Governorate and Taurida Governorate (not including Crimea). Geography The governorate bordered Yekaterinoslav Governorate and Kherson Governorate to its north. The Strait of Kerch bordered the Free lands of the Don Cossacks. It has natural borders, being surrounded by the waters of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. The mainland and the peninsular parts of the region differ significantly. The total area of the governorate was of which the mainland portion consisted of and is largely black earth steppe land. The population of the whole region was 1,634,700 in 1906. At that time, the mainland part of the governorate was mostly populated by Ukrainians and Russians but had significant ethnic minorities of Germans, Bulgarians, Armenians and Jews, while major ethnic groups of the Crimean peninsula were Crimean Tatars and Russians with German, Greek, Poles, Armenian, and Karaim minorities. Major urban centres were Simferopol, Sevastopol, Theodosia, Bakhchisaray, and Yalta in Crimea, and Aleshki, Berdyansk, and Melitopol on the mainland.

Soon after this the Taurida Oblast was established. During the reign of Paul I the oblast was abolished, but soon (in 1802) re-established as a governorate (guberniya). It was a part of the Russian Empire until the Russian Revolution of 1918. Following the 1917 October Revolution, the ethnic Tatar government proclaimed the Crimean People's Republic on December 13, 1917, which was the first Muslim Democratic state. The Tatar republic covered the peninsular portion of the former governorate, while its northern counties ended up temporarily under jurisdiction of the Yekaterinoslav Governorate. However neither Ukraine nor the Crimea managed to hold on to their territories and were overrun by Bolshevik Red Guards in the winter of 1917-18. Briefly in early 1918 the bolsheviks split the governorate territories between the Taurida Soviet Socialist Republic and the Donetsk-Krivoi Rog Soviet Republic before being overrun by the forces of the Ukrainian People's Republic with military assistance from the German Empire.

The mutiny was part of the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1905, which by summer 1906 had effectively been suppressed in most other regions of the Russian Empire. Background The Fortress of Sveaborg had been constructed in the 18th century to provide sea defenses for Helsinki. In 1906 it was garrisoned by approximately 1,800 artillerymen, 1,500 infantrymen and 250 pioneers. The combined force of over 3,500 made up over half of the total Tsarist troops based in and around Helsinki. All of these troops were Russian as no Finnish units of the Imperial Army were stationed in the Grand Duchy. Leadership The ringleaders of the rising were three junior Russian officers in the garrison: Captain Sergei Tsion and Lieutenants Emelyanv and Kokhanskiy. Tsion, who was a secret Bolshevik sympathizer, had made contact with a Finnish Labour Corps leader Johan Kock. The Labour Corps were an anti-Tsarist political movement that favored social revolution in Finland. They were believed to number over 6,000 members and had, since the major disturbances of 1905 within Russia itself, been preparing for a Finnish uprising. They were, however, poorly armed and untrained. Mutiny Tsesarevich helped to put the rebellion down from sea. The mutiny broke out on the evening of 30 July, earlier than the military conspirators had planned. Poor food and the withdrawal of a special allowance had, however, sparked discontent amongst the pioneers and artillerymen of the garrison, most of whom were conscripts drawn from industrial regions of Russia. The pioneer company was particularly unsettled and had been put under collective arrest by the general commanding the Sveaoborg Fortress and neighboring outposts. In response most of the artillerymen mutinied, expelling or imprisoning their officers. By daylight on 31 July about 2,000 men had joined the mutiny. The infantry component of the garrison, drawn from rural areas and more amenable to army discipline than their radicalised counterparts in the technical branches, mostly remained loyal to their officers. Suppression Arrested Labour Corp members in Aleksanterinkatu. The leaders of the mutiny hoped that their example would lead to uprisings amongst the sailors of the Baltic Fleet from the naval bases at Helsinki and Kronstadt. However, the naval unrest of the previous year had now subsided and the crews of the warships close to Sveaborg showed no inclination to join the mutiny. Equally, the cossack cavalry and the infantry units that made up the remainder of the Imperial Army forces in Finland continued to obey orders. Although the mutineers were able to capture nearby Katajanokka, the rising quickly lost momentum. Following a naval bombardment on 1 August, the bulk of the mutinous artillerymen and pioneers surrendered to loyal troops. The mutiny had lasted only 60 hours. Emelyanv and Kokhanskiy were executed, although Tsion's fate is uncertain. Finnish involvement Russian gendarmes taking Red rebels as prisoners A few hundred members of the Finnish Labour Corps had joined with the Russian mutineers and Johan Kock had called for a general strike in support of them. However, fighting broke out in Hakaniemi, between Russian sailors from the naval barracks and Finnish \\"Whites\\", acting in opposition to Kock's \\"Reds\\". There were several dozen casualties before Tsarist forces were able to restore order. Johan Kock was able to escape to Sweden and ultimately to England. Reasons for failure In spite of the numbers involved the \\"Sveaborg Rebellion\\" proved far less of a threat to the Tsarist government than the mutinies of the previous year had done. The reasons included the indifference of the bulk of the Finnish population to any dissatisfaction within the Russian occupying forces and the fact that by August 1906 discipline and morale had been largely restored within the Tsarist army and navy.

Although the Commonwealth has the power to regulate interstate air navigation under s 51(i) of the Constitution, it can only regulate intrastate air navigation under the implied incidental power attached to that head of power. It was held that intrastate air navigation can be regulated to the extent that it provides for the safety of, or prevention of physical interference with, interstate or foreign air navigation.  Background  In October 1964 the Air Navigation Regulations (Cth),Air Navigation Regulations 1947 (Cth). were amended to make them apply to intrastate air navigation by the enactment of regulation 6(1)(f).Air Navigation Regulations 1964 No 128 (Cth). Regulation 198 prohibited the use of an aircraft in regular public transport operations except pursuant to a licence issued by the Director-General of Civil Aviation, who, according to regulation 199(4), will have regard to the \\"safety, regularity and efficiency of air navigation and to no other matters\\". Regulation 200B stated that \\"an airline licence authorizes the conduct of operations in accordance with the provisions of the licence\\". The plaintiff, Airlines of New South Wales, had applied unsuccessfully for a licence to perform commercial air operations between Sydney and Dubbo, and then sought to challenge the validity and constitutional consistency of the Air Transport Act 1964 (NSW).Air Transport Act 1964 (NSW).  The decision  = Regulations 198 and 199(4) = The Court rejected the American doctrine of commingling that has found favour in the Supreme Court of the United States. Commonwealth legislative power cannot be enlarged to cover intrastate air navigation regardless of the integration of intrastate and interstate activities. However, Commonwealth laws can include intrastate activities within its ambit if for the Commonwealth law to be effective, it must operate indifferently to all activities, whether intrastate or interstate, in the relevant area. In particular, Kitto J stated that \\"the Australian union is one of dual federalism\\", and it is the Court's role to preserve such distinctions, however arbitrary; this distinction was also referred to by Dixon CJ in Wragg v State of New South Wales,. which was quoted by Barwick CJ in this case. Kitto J continued to state that to ascertain the true character of the law, we examine what it does \\"in the way of changing or creating or destroying duties or rights or powers\\".. Furthermore, Barwick CJ reiterated the rejection of the reserved State powers doctrine (see Amalgamated Society of Engineers v Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd.). In this instance, the enactment of State laws will not serve to curtail any Commonwealth power; the Commonwealth's power is to be construed from the text of the Constitution. Section 51(i) permits the Commonwealth to make laws, for interstate and foreign air operations, about safety, regularity and efficiency, as this would protect, foster and encourage interstate and foreign trade and commerce. Barwick CJ stated that this would then serve to extend to include intrastate air navigation, due to intrinsic factors related to flight, and the factual situation in this case. Similarly, the Commonwealth licensing regime, which Barwick CJ held to be a \\"substantial safety procedure\\", can apply to intrastate air operations or operators because of the impact of unsafe, inefficient or irregular air operations by intrastate airline operators. Kitto J stated that the law is within power if it protects against physical interference by having regard to safety, regularity and efficiency; this is in contrast to matters merely consequential to interstate or foreign air navigation, which would not suffice. = Regulation 200B = Barwick CJ contrasted regulations 198 and 199(4) to regulation 200B. In the former, regulation of intrastate navigation was found to be in the Commonwealth's power to safeguard the safety of interstate and foreign air navigation. However, in the latter, the regulation purports to authorise the air operations themselves, as opposed to regulating the use of specified aircraft in those operations. The stimulation or authorisation of those operations that the regulation provides went beyond the regulation being a safety measure.

It was first published in The Atlantic Monthly in July 1960 and won the \\"Atlantic First\\" award. The story has become a classic of American literature, and has been frequently republished in high school anthologies and other collections. Plot The Narrator, who is not named but simply called \\"Brother\\", recounts the life of his younger brother, William Armstrong, nicknamed \\"Doodle\\". Doodle is born a sickly child, who is not expected to live because of his birth defects. His family even has a small coffin made in the case of his death, and presumably chooses the robust name 'William Armstrong' because it would look good on a gravestone. Doodle survives, but for most of his childhood, he is unable to move or respond to his environment. Brother even goes so far as planning to smother the baby with a pillow, thinking that having no brother was better than having a brother who wasn't truly there. Luckily, Doodle smiles at Brother before he can do the deed, and, overjoyed that his brother is smart, Brother leaves him be. Doodle eventually learns to crawl, even though the doctor says the strain of even sitting up might kill him because of his weak heart. He crawls backwards, though, reminding the narrator of a doodlebug, leading him to nickname William, \\"Doodle\\". But Doodle is still very weak and feeble. Brother wanted someone who could run and jump and play with him, but resents having the weak and fragile Doodle instead. The narrator even has to pull his brother around in a wooden go-kart his father built him, because Doodle can't walk. It is now that Brother decides to train Doodle to be a \\"normal human being\\". He takes Doodle down to the swamp to teach him how to walk. Eventually, shortly before his sixth birthday, Doodle learns to walk with help from Brother. Encouraged by this, Brother decides to teach Doodle how to run, climb vines, swim, row and even fight to prepare Doodle for school. However, almost a year after the plan was made, Doodle is far from accomplishing the goals by the nearing deadline. One day, a big red bird appears in their garden, looking sick and tired. The boys' father identifies it as a scarlet ibis, a tropical bird that was blown off-course by a recent storm. When the bird dies, Doodle, pitying the creature, buries it, while the rest of the family looks on and laughs. Afterwards, the boys go to the nearby Horsehead Landing to continue Doodle's \\"training\\". On their way back to the house, Brother has Doodle practice rowing. A sudden rainstorm comes, and when they reach the riverbank, Doodle is tired and frightened. Brother, angry and frustrated that Doodle could not finish his training before school starts, runs ahead of Doodle, leaving the frightened boy behind. When Brother does not see Doodle, he returns for him, his anger dissipated. To his horror, he finds Doodle, lifeless, lying on the ground with blood flowing out of his mouth, staining his throat and shirt a brilliant red. The story ends with Brother crying and cradling Doodle's body. As this happens, Brother recalls how he killed Doodle with his selfish pride. Analysis The story has been described as \\"rich in symbolism\\". The scarlet ibis is the main symbol in the story, as is the color red and the ibis in comparison to Doodle as fragile yet majestic. The storm is often compared to Doodle's brother because the brother pushed him too hard, much as the storm did with the scarlet ibis. The story also examines the ambiguous nature of pride: \\"I did not know then that pride is a wonderful, terrible thing, a seed that bears two vines, life and death.\\" Brother acknowledges that pride is wonderful because it has allowed for Doodle to do great and unexpected things but also terrible because his true motivations were not pure and ultimately caused Doodle's death. Opera The story was developed into an opera by composer Stefan Weisman with librettist David Cote. The opera was co-produced by New York City's Beth Morrison Projects and HERE Arts Center in association with American Opera Projects, and premiered in the PROTOTYPE Opera Festival on January 8, 2015. New York Times critic, David Allen, called the opera \\"a moving, intense and dignified creation.\\" The opera was produced in January 2019 by the Boston Opera Collaborative and February 2019 by the Chicago Opera Theater. James Hurst James Hurst was born on January 1, 1922, near Jacksonville, North Carolina. He attended Booker T. Washington High School in Atlanta, Georgia and studied chemical engineering at North Carolina State College. However, following military service in World War II, he decided to be an opera singer and studied at the Juilliard School of Music in New York and in Italy. In 1951, Hurst abandoned his musical career and became a banker in New York for the next thirty-four years. He wrote plays and short stories in his spare time. \\"The Scarlet Ibis\\" was his only literary work that gained widespread recognition, appearing in the July 1960 issue of The Atlantic Monthly and earning the 'Atlantic First' prize that year. James Hurst died in Jacksonville, North Carolina, on October 24, 2013, at the age of 91.

Gachet was a great supporter of artists and the Impressionist movement. He was an amateur painter, signing his works \\"Paul van Ryssel\\", referring to his birthplace: Rijssel is the Dutch name of Lille. Similarly, Gachet's son Paul-Louis signed Louis van Ryssel Biography He was born and raised in Lille. His family moved to Mechelen, where Gachet's father was transferred to in 1844/1845 to start a new branch of the firm he was working for.A vast chronology of Doctor Gachet's life, compiled by his son, is supplied in Distel, Anne and Stein, Susan Alyson (1999) Cézanne to Van Gogh: The Collection of Doctor Gachet, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, , pp. 273–288 While a student at the University of Paris, he learnt drawing in his spare time, and collected paintings by Gustave Courbet and Édouard Manet.. After gaining his BA degree, he worked at the mental hospitals of Bicêtre and Salpêtrière. His teachers included Armand Trousseau. In 1858 he received a medical degree for his thesis Étude sur la Mélancolie (Éditeur du Montpellier Médecal). He returned to Paris and set up a private homeopathic practice.Henley, Jon. The Guardian, January 27, 1999, \\"The remarkable Dr Gachet\\". Gachet married Blanche Castets in 1868. Their daughter, Margueritte Clémentine Elisa was born in 1869. In 1872 he moved to Auvers-sur-Oise, a town around from the centre of the city that was popular with artists. There he continued his medical practice, but also associated with artists such as Camille Pissarro and Paul Cézanne, Cézanne helping him establish his own studio in his attic. Gachet also knew Gustave Courbet, Champfleury and Victor Hugo. He was a friend of the chemist Henri Nestlé and prescribed Nestlé's new powdered milk supplement to some of his child patients. Under the pen-name Blanche de Mézin, he published books in medicine and art-criticism. He spent much time with Charles Méryon after the etcher's committal to Charenton. He oversaw Auguste Renoir's recovery from pneumonia in 1882. He advised Édouard Manet against the amputation of his leg. However, Manet did not follow this advice. Gachet's tomb is situated in section 52 of Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Gachet and Vincent Van Gogh Paul Gachet, painting by Vincent van Gogh (1890), second version (see below) Vincent Van Gogh suffered from a mental disorder and was sent to an asylum for a couple of years. He then was released from the asylum, but still had to receive treatment and be under supervision. Vincent's brother, Theo van Gogh, thought that Gachet's background and sensitivity toward artists would make him an ideal doctor for Vincent during his recovery. Very soon after he began seeing Gachet, however, Vincent began to doubt the doctor's usefulness.Letter Vincent described Gachet as: \\"sicker than I am, I think, or shall we say just as much\\". However, after a while of meeting up with Dr. Gachet, Van Gogh came to realize that he isn't as bad as he thought. Van Gogh found a friend in him; he mentions that he wasn't only a muse but also a caretaker. \\"Vincent alternately wrote of the doctor, 'I have found in him a complete friend, even something like a new brother,' \\" Puchko, Kristy. “15 Things You Didn't Know About Van Gogh's Portrait of Dr. Gachet.” Mental Floss, 9 Feb. 2016, www.mentalfloss.com/article/74774/15-things-you-didnt-know-about-van-goghs- portrait-dr-gachet. which says a lot about what he thought about Dr. Gachet. Gachet has come in for much criticism over the years regarding Van Gogh's suicide after ten weeks of consultation. However, Van Gogh was either unable or unwilling to follow his doctors' advice to cut back on alcohol and smoking. According to Arnold, \\"there was not much else available to any physician of the day which could have reversed the course of Vincent's illness,\\"Arnold, Wilfred N. (1992) Vincent van Gogh: Chemicals, Crises, and Creativity, Birkhãuser, Boston, , p. 66 and he summarizes the medical treatment that Van Gogh received from his various doctors thus: \\"The overall assessment is rather that they did as well as expected with an unfamiliar disease and a difficult patient.\\"Arnold, work cited, page 216. Arnold assumes his own diagnosis of acute intermittent porphyria Subject in art Gachet was friends with and treated Pissarro, Renoir, Manet, Cézanne and Goeneutte, to name just a few. He had amassed one of the largest impressionist art collections in Europe before he died in 1909. Gachet, his wife and his home were the subjects of several pieces of art by celebrated artists including: Portrait of Dr. Gachet.jpgPortrait of Dr. Gachet, painting by Vincent van Gogh (1890), first version Vincent van Gogh - Man with a Pipe (Portrait of Dr. Paul Gachet).jpgDr. Gachet, etching by Vincent van Gogh (1890) Paul Gachet by Leandre.jpgPaul Gachet by Charles Leandre (c. 1887) Paul Gachet by Detrez.jpgPaul Gachet by Ambroise Detrez (1850-1852) Norbert Gœneutte - Le Docteur Paul Gachet.jpgPaul Gachet, painting by Norbert Goeneutte (1891), Musée d'Orsay, Paris Paul Gachet by Bernard.jpgPaul Gachet by Émile Bernard (1926 posthumous) Musée d'Orsay La Maison du Docteur Gachet à Auvers, par Paul Cézanne.jpgPaul Cézanne, The House of Doctor Gachet in Auvers (1872-1873) Musée d’Orsay Portrayals Mathieu Amalric plays Gachet in Julian Schnabel's At Eternity's Gate, which depicts van Gogh (Willem Dafoe) painting Gachet's portrait in one scene.

Mayhew is located at west of Columbus, north of Artesia, east of Starkville and south of West Point. According to the United States Geological Survey, a variant name is Mayhew Station. Mayhew Station was the original name given to this community when it was moved from its original site (near Muldrow, Mississippi) to alongside the tracks of the newly built Mobile and Ohio Railroad (later Gulf, Mobile & Ohio) in the very early 1850s. The original location of the town of Mayhew is now referred to as Old Mayhew, but only a cemetery exists there today. Mayhew held the distinction for most of the 20th century as being home to Stover Apiaries, the world's largest queen bee apiary, which shipped queen bees to beekeepers worldwide. Mayhew is also referred to as Mayhew Junction, or more commonly as \\"The Crossroads\\" by area residents, a reference to when US Highways 82 and 45 crossed as at-grade two-lane highways. Before the construction of the new US 82 and the expansion of US 45 to four lanes, the intersection of the original highways was a four way stop. Several bars and service stations lined the four sides of the original intersection, and were torn down when the new expressways were built over a period of several years between 1975 and 1995.

In 1960, seven black men from Little Rock used a restroom at Weaver's Amoco in Osborn, where there was only one restroom, which was for whites only. They were arrested in Mayhew and required to pay a $200 per person bond. According to the law, they faced a maximum penalty of six months in jail and finds of $500 each. The case was widely anticipated as the first test of the state's sit-in law, but was settled when the defendants unexpectedly pleaded guilty and paid a small fine in Starkville the next day.

He is best known for his four- decade association with the University of Arizona. He served as athletic director at U of A from 1914 to 1957. He served as Arizona's head football coach from 1914 to 1930, compiling a record of 80–32–6. McKale was also the head basketball coach at Arizona from 1914 to 1921, tallying a mark of 49–12, and the head baseball coach at the school from 1915 to 1919 and again from 1922 to 1949, amassing a record of 304–118–7. McKale was inducted into the Arizona Sportsmen Hall of Fame in 1959 and was a charter member of the Arizona Sports Hall of Fame, inducted in 1976. The McKale Center, the University of Arizona's home basketball venue, was opened in 1973 and named in McKale's honor. Early life McKale was born in Lansing, Michigan to William H. and Clara (Bateman) McKale on June 12, 1887. He graduated from Lansing High School in 1905. While enrolled at Albion College, McKale competed in baseball, football, and long jump. McKale was named a two-time All-State athlete in both football and baseball at Albion College. He helped the football team win a Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association championship in 1908 and served as the team's captain in 1908 and 1909. A four-year varsity letter winner in both baseball and football, McKale served as the student president of the MIAA in 1909–10. He graduated with a degree in history and chemistry in 1910. As a student, McKale was offered a minor league baseball by the Minneapolis Millers. He instead decided to become a teacher and accepted a position in Superior, Wisconsin. The next year, McKale saw an advertisement for a teaching position at Tucson High School in Tucson, Arizona. The school principal, Harold Steele, was a fellow Albion alum and he hired McKale by telegram. Following his arrival in September 1911, McKale taught history and served as the coach for all of Tucson High's athletic programs. On Thanksgiving that year his football team defeated the University of Arizona junior varsity squad 11–0. After McKale's baseball team won a game against U of A's baseball team, Arizona students began petitioning their school to hire McKale. School officials obliged, and hired McKale on June 2, 1914. McKale married Ada L. Sackett on July 31, 1915. The union produced three daughters: Elizabeth, Ruth, and Marian. McKale completed a Master of Education with a minor in law in 1919. Coaching career Upon his arrival at the University of Arizona, McKale served as the school's athletic director and coach for the varsity football and basketball teams. In 1915 he added track and baseball to his coaching duties. He coached the track and basketball teams for 7 seasons. As a basketball coach, McKale achieved a record of 49 wins and 12 losses, going undefeated during the 1914–15, 1915–16, and 1920–21 seasons (season records of 9–0, 5–0, and 7–0 respectively). McKale coached baseball from 1915 to 1949, achieving a record of 302 wins and 102 losses. As football coach, McKale earned a record of 80 wins, 32 losses and 6 ties between 1914 and 1930. It was in this role that he was also involved in the creation of several of the University of Arizona's athletic traditions. The school's nickname comes from a 1914 game coached by McKale against Occidental College. Following the game a Los Angeles Times reporter wrote \\"“the Arizona men showed the fight of wildcats…” The school motto came over a decade later. On October 3, 1926, John \\"Button\\" Salmon was involved in an automobile accident which caused severe damage to his spine. Salmon was the student body president, starting quarterback, catcher for the baseball team, Sigma Nu member, and member of multiple student honorary organizations. McKale visited Salmon every day in the hospital until Salmon's death on October 19. During his last visit, McKale asked if Salmon had a message for the football team. Salmon replied \\"Tell them ... tell them to bear down.\\" McKale told the football team of Salmon's message during a pregame talk before their next game. The phrase \\"Bear Down\\" became the school's motto in 1927 following a student-led proposal. As athletic director, McKale oversaw the construction of most of U of A's initial athletic infrastructure. The university's first basketball arena, the Men's Gymnasium (now Bear Down Gym), was completed in 1926. Arizona Stadium in turn was opened in 1929 and regularly sold out its 27,000 seats. McKale retired in 1957 due to the school's then mandatory retirement age of 70. Outside of athletics, McKale pursued several other activities. He founded the university's Sigma Nu chapter in 1918. McKale was also interested in history, with his primary focus upon George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. His book, Abraham Lincoln: The Politician, was published in 1957. McKale received a number of honors for his athletic accomplishments. He was inducted into the Arizona Sportsmen Hall of Fame in 1959, became a charter member of the Arizona Sports Hall of Fame in 1976, and was inducted into the Pima County Sports Hall of Fame in 1996. McKale Memorial Center is named in his honor. The University of Arizona also named a street (since renamed after Fred Enke) and the school's aquatic center (since renamed for a sponsor that provided funds to refurbish the center) after him.

It is structurally classed as a synovial saddle joint and functionally classed as a diarthrosis and multiaxial joint. It is composed of two portions separated by an articular disc of fibrocartilage. The bone areas entering into its formation are the sternal end of the clavicle, the upper and lateral part of the sternum, (the clavicular notch), and the cartilage of the first rib, visible from the outside as the suprasternal notch. The articular surface of the clavicle is much larger than that of the sternum, and is invested with a layer of cartilage, which is considerably thicker than that on the sternum. The costoclavicular ligament is the main limitation to movement, and therefore the main stabilizer of the joint. A fibrocartilaginous disc present at the joint increases the range of movement. Sternoclavicular dislocation is rare, but may result from direct trauma to the clavicle or indirect forces applied to the shoulder.Arend CF. Ultrasound of the Shoulder. Master Medical Books, 2013. Free section on sternoclavicular joint dislocation available at ShoulderUS.com Posterior dislocations deserve special attention, as they have the potential to be life-threatening because of the risk of damage to vital structures in the mediastinum. Structure * Anterior sternoclavicular ligament * Articular capsule * Articular disk * Costoclavicular ligament * Interclavicular ligament * Posterior sternoclavicular ligament  Function  The sternoclavicular joint allows movement of the clavicle in three planes, predominantly in the anteroposterior and vertical planes, although some rotation also occurs. A description of movement would be elevation and depression. Muscles don't directly act on this joint, although almost all actions of the shoulder girdle or the scapula will cause some motion at this articulation. The unique double-hinged articular disk found at the junction of the clavicular head and manubrium allows for movement between the clavicle and the disk during elevation and depression of the scapula. This disk also allows motion between the sternum (manubrium) and itself during protraction and retraction of the scapula.Lippert, Lynn. Clinical Kinesiology and Anatomy, 4th edition; pg.95-96.  Clinical significance  Trauma may result in the dislocation of the sternoclavicular joint. Posterior dislocation puts the mediastinal structures at risk. A spontaneous partial dislocation can also occur sometimes. In SAPHO syndrome there may be arthropathy of the sternoclavicular joint. Septic arthritis may rarely affect the sternoclavicular joint.

With the Redskins he played in Super Bowl XVIII. He became the second former NFL player to come out as gay and the first to disclose that he was HIV-positive. Early life Born in Savannah, Georgia, Simmons had five siblings from multiple fathers. As a child, he was sexually assaulted by a male acquaintance, and he later said that he was severely affected by the trauma of that event. At Alfred E. Beach High School in Savannah, he became a highly recruited football star before committing to play at Georgia Tech. At Georgia Tech, he acquired the nickname \\"Sugarbear\\" due to his fun-loving personality. Though Simmons developed a habit of getting intoxicated and visiting bathhouses near the Georgia Tech campus, his college friends did not suspect that he was gay. Professional football career After his career at Georgia Tech, he became an eighth-round draft pick of the New York Giants in 1979. After signing with the team, Simmons moved his three younger brothers to New Jersey to live with him. Later, his mother and other family members moved in. Simmons was a regular on the offensive line in his rookie season, and by 1980 he started all 16 games as the left guard. Simmons later said that he fell into problems with substance abuse during his time in the NFL. He felt that he had to keep his sexuality a secret, writing, \\"The N.F.L. has a reputation, and it’s not even a verbal thing — it's just known. You are gladiators; you are male; you kick butt.\\" Simmons lost his position as a starter in 1981 and he left the Giants before the 1982 season, citing mental fatigue. After briefly working as an airport baggage handler and failing to make the Giants roster in a 1983 comeback, he was signed by the Redskins. He appeared in the 1984 Super Bowl. Simmons appeared briefly in the United States Football League, but his professional career was over by 1985. In 1989, one of Simmons' young cousins had revealed to a girlfriend of Simmons that the former player had male lovers. Embarrassed, Simmons moved to San Francisco and disengaged from his family. He became immersed in the city's drug culture, was injured in a knife fight and became homeless at one point. Personal life In 1992, he announced that he was gay on The Phil Donahue Show. Around 1997, he learned that he was HIV-positive. In 2006, three days before the Super Bowl, Simmons requested a media credential and two tickets to the game. The NFL denied his request, saying that it had received too many similar requests to accommodate all of them. Simmons and attorney Gloria Allred wrote to the NFL and requested an investigation into whether his request had been denied due to his sexuality or his HIV status. His autobiography, Out of Bounds, was published that year. According to Simmons' brother Gary, the former NFL player lived alone and spent several stints in drug treatment after his playing career. Simmons was a born-again Christian, and a Christian Broadcasting Network video profile intimated that Simmons came to see homosexuality as immoral, but Simmons' brother said that Simmons was always proud to identify as a gay black man. Simmons died February 20, 2014, in his Bronx, New York apartment at the age of 57. In 2015, he was inducted into the National Gay and Lesbian Sports Hall of Fame. In an interview in 2019, former NBA player Al Harrington revealed that Simmons was his cousin, and that as a child his goal was to grow up and play for the New York Giants just like his older cousin Roy.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twYZhsBcB6Q See also * Homosexuality in American football References Category:1956 births Category:2014 deaths Category:African-American Christians Category:African-American players of American football Category:American football offensive guards Category:Gay sportsmen Category:LGBT players of American football Category:Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football players Category:LGBT African Americans Category:LGBT people from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:LGBT Protestants Category:LGBT sportspeople from the United States Category:New York Giants players Category:Sportspeople from Savannah, Georgia Category:People with HIV/AIDS Category:Players of American football from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Washington Redskins players Category:AIDS-related deaths in New York (state) ","title":"Roy Simmons (American football)"},{"id":"4891004","text":"See also West Melton, New Zealand and Melton West, Victoria.

They provide all train services at the station, mainly hourly services between and , and between and . The station's car park was significantly expanded in 2013. The line through Worle is not electrified, but there is significant local support for it to be electrified as part of the 21st-century modernisation of the Great Western Main Line, partly motivated by worries that unless the line is electrified, Weston-super-Mare will lose direct services to London.  Description  Worle railway station is located in the east of Weston-super-Mare, North Somerset serving the suburbs of Worle, West Wick and St Georges. The surrounding area is primarily residential, but with several commercial developments, including the Worle Parkway office development next to the station. The station is located just off the B3440 Bristol Road, near the M5 motorway junction 21 and the A370. There is a car park on the north, east and south sides of the station.

Looking west along the platforms. The station car park, seen here in 2012, was expanded in 2013 with 320 extra spaces and a bus interchange. The line through Worle saw its first use on 14 June 1841, when the first section of the Bristol and Exeter Railway's (B&ER;) main line between Bristol and was opened. The line, engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was built as broad-gauge but was reconstructed as a mixed-gauge line to accommodate local -gauge traffic by 1 June 1875. Services were operated by the Great Western Railway (GWR) on behalf of the B&ER; until 1 May 1849. The B&ER; then took over its own workings until the company was amalgamated into the GWR on 1 January 1876. Broad-gauge trains ceased operation on 20 May 1892. When the railways were nationalised by the Transport Act 1947, the line became part of the Western Region of British Railways. The modern Worle railway station is the fourth station to serve Worle. The first station, east of the modern station, was opened in 1841 as Banwell and was known as Worle from 1869 to 1884, then as Puxton and Worle from 1922 until closure in 1964. From 1884 to 1922, there was a station called Worle on the loop line to , west of the modern station. There was also a station on the nearby Weston, Clevedon and Portishead Light Railway, which was known as Worle from 1897 to 1913, then as Worle (Moor Lane) until 1917, and as Worle Town until closure in 1940. The station at Worle was developed as a joint initiative between British Rail and Avon County Council. It cost £700,000 and was built using lightweight construction materials due to being sited on marshy ground. The station was opened on 24 September 1990 by Councillor Betty Perry, the chair of Avon Council. The first train was a westbound Regional Railways service, operated by Sprinter DMU 150270. All services were local ones – no scheduled intercity services would call at Worle until 2007. Upon the privatisation of British Rail in 1997, services were franchised to Wales & West, which was in turn succeeded in 2001 by Wessex Trains, an arm of National Express. The Wessex franchise was amalgamated with the Great Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006, and responsibility passed to First Great Western, a subsidiary company of FirstGroup, which was later rebranded Great Western Railway. Great Western Railway services to and from London Paddington started calling at Worle in 2007. Due to the trains being longer than the platforms, a selective door opening system was used to prevent passengers opening doors which were not adjacent to the platform. In 2012, plans to enhance the station's facilities were approved by the Department for Transport. The works, part of a large transport scheme called the Weston Package, included construction of a new council run car park containing 320 spaces on the South side of the station, better facilities for cyclists and motorcyclists, and a bus interchange. A bus link to the nearby Queensway retail park was also included in the scheme. The expansion took over unused land to the east and south of the station, and required the removal of slowworms and grass snakes to a nature reserve in Cheddar. The work, which started in April 2013, was completed later the same year with the new car park opening on 3 September 2013. Worle has had a large number of incidents of railway vandalism and antisocial behaviour, and the stretch of line through Worle is considered one of the most vandalised in the United Kingdom – obstructions have been left on the line and stones have being thrown at railway staff. There have been several incidents of train guards being attacked by passengers who refused to pay their fares, including one incident where the guard was dragged from the train and knocked to the ground. Vandals have also damaged the station's ticket machines, attacked passengers and slashed the tyres of cars parked at the station.  Future  Worle is on the Weston-super-Mare/ corridor, one of the main axes of the Greater Bristol Metro, a rail transport plan which aims to enhance transport capacity in the Bristol area. The group Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways supports the electrification of the line through Nailsea & Backwell, as does MP for Weston- super-Mare John Penrose.

The company was acquired in 2003 by the Alcan Corporation, headquartered in Canada. In 2007, Alcan itself was taken over by mining giant Rio Tinto Alcan. Prior to its acquisition, Pechiney grew to be the world's 4th largest producer and developer of aluminium products, employing 34,000 people and operating 320 manufacturing and sales facilities in 50 countries at the time it was purchased by Alcan. The group operated in all facets of the aluminium industry from bauxite mining to the development of sophisticated applications of metal products in addition to international commodities trading and brokerage of the metal on the London Metal Exchange (LME). Pechiney gained worldwide recognition for its use of electrolysis technology, and was a leader in specialty packaging and aerospace applications.Pechiney accepts Alcan bid. BBC News, September 12, 2003 History The company was founded in 1855 by Henri Merle as a producer of caustic soda at a manufacturing facility in Salindres. Founded as Compagnie des Produits Chimiques Henri Merle the company was renamed in 1897 the Société des Produits Chimiques d'Alais et de la Camargue. The company first began producing aluminium metal in 1860 using a chemically- based process developed by Henri Sainte-Claire Deville in 1854 and was granted a 30-year monopoly by the French government. During World War I (1914–18) Tréfileries et Laminoirs du Havre (TLH) acquired a large stake in the Société d'Alais et de la Camargue. This company in turn took control of the Société électrométallurgique de Froges in 1919 to become the Compagnie des produits chimiques et électrométallurgiques d'Alais, Froges et Camargue. Hippolyte Bouchayer represented TLH in Pechiney. Pechiney had developed a significant presence in Europe in the 1930s and first prospected the American market in 1911 before acquiring a strong foothold there in the 1960s. In the 1954, Pechiney expanded into Africa and subsequently it developed a presence in Australia, Latin America, Greece and Asia. The corporate name was changed to Pechiney in 1948, after a former influential managing director referred to by the same name, A. R. Pechiney. In 1962 TLH merged with the Compagnie française des métaux and became Tréfimétaux. In 1967 Tréfimétaux was acquired by Pechiney and became the copper division of that group, contributing 8% of the group's total. =Brandeis Brokers= Brandeis (Brokers) Ltd was a broker and ring dealing member on the London Metal Exchange that operated as a subsidiary of Pechiney from 1981 through 2000, when it was banned from trading by the FSA.The Guardian's \\"Metals broker is evicted from City and pays £1.75m\\"FSA decision in PDF format Brandeis was one of the founding members of the London Metal Exchange in 1877.

Its transmitter is located in Folsom, and its studios are in North Sacramento (just north of the American River). History 105.1 FM signed on the air on February 21, 1960 as KHIQ. In the 1970s and early 1980s, that station had a \\"beautiful music\\" format and the call letters were KEWT. It was automated using the Cart-O-Matic system, popular in the late 1970s. The then rival KAER 92.5 Country music station was the only FM station competing with the AM giant KRAK featuring DJs Joey Mitchell, Racin' Rick Stewart and Big Jim Hall. Management decided to give KAER a challenge and try the Country Market with KEWT, changing the call letters to KSKK. It was a huge success. After a short while, KAER dumped the country format and started playing Adult Contemporary, which turned out to be a successful venture for them. Later, KSKK became KRAK-FM.

He organised routes to smuggle revolutionary writings from Sweden via Finland to Russia. In 1905 during the general strike the academic society and labor protested together against the Russian czar. Kock became the leader of the national guard during the strike. Kock gained the support and trust of the general governor Ivan Obolensky. Nevertheless, Obolensky negotiated with the Constitutionals how to solve the strike by political means. The Academic society couldn't accept Kock's leadership: university students and polytechniques split off, founding their own organisation under the leadership of Gösta Thörsleff. The Constitutionals wanted to end the strike on 5 November, but the Labour Corps to continue. Kock, who supported the strike, attended the negotiations to end the strike. The strike ended on 6 November, and on the next day Kock pulled his troops from the Helsinki police stations. Kock took part in the Sveaborg Rebellion in 1906 in the Sveaborg fortress (renamed \\"Suomenlinna\\" in Finnish in 1918).

Brushko returned to photography, when, after the army, he went to be trained as a photography technologist at a vocational school in Maladziečna. After leaving it, he was assigned to a job as a studio photographer in Salihorsk. However, Brushko immediately tried to find a freer and more promising job and was soon noticed as a freelance author, first with a local newspaper, and later with the nation-wide newspaper Čyrvonaja Zmiena. On the wave of glasnost and the emergence of the national democratic movement, the Belarusian-language outlet constantly raised acute social and political topics. This could not affect the works of Siarhei Brushko, as his photos became expressly social, while the Soviet-style realism disappeared from his works and art photography retreated to the background. At this time, Brushko began working on the theme of the Chernobyl tragedy, and the topic eventually became the author’s calling. Since his first trips to the relocation zone in 1987, later to the oncology centre and up to the last trip two months before his death, the topic echoed in the society. It was the social tragedy after the explosion that formed the basis of the photographer’s works. Almost without touching the exclusion zone and environmental aspects, Siarhei Brushko talked about the tragedy of innocent people who were simply expelled from their land as a result of a man-made disaster and the recklessness of people. The themes of meetings and partings, wandering without a native land, pain and illness were all stocked for a dozen years to be eventually told through photographs. During those years, Brushko published a number of reports, most notably about a women’s prison, street children, and the extinction of villages. The theme of country life also became one of the author’s work dominants. After all, it was his thorough knowledge of rural life from the inside that helped the photographer reveal it widely and brightly. Brushko’s realistic view of rural life helps read without psychological evidence the psychological portrait of the Belarusian village, its stagnation, isolation, but at the same time, its inner peace and balance. The active period lasted about 10 years. In the mid-90s, the photographer was diagnosed with incurable Raynaud’s syndrome. It was during this time that his only book was published, Brushko’s co-project with the Swiss photographer Hugo Jaeggi “Die Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt: Belarus im Jahre Zwölf nach Tschernobyl” (1998). In the last 2 years of his life, the photographer struggled with the disease, spending most of his time in the hospital. Siarhei Brushko died on 28 August 2000 and was buried in his native town of Haradzieja.
