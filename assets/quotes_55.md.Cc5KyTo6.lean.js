Their final release of new material for Hollywood Records, it was released in 1997. The album was met with positive reception from critics. Recording and release The musicians making up The Minus 5 overlapped with the auxiliary touring members of R.E.M. and Tuatara; the musicians recorded The Lonesome Death of Buck McCoy alongside Mark Eitzel's West. The opportunity to record and tour with the material spurred Scott McCaughey to finish off songs that Peter Buck had started writing two years prior. The revolving door of performers supported all their releases (including Tuatara's Breaking the Ethers) with The Magnificent Seven Vs. the United States tour in 1997. This album was the first release from Hollywood Records imprint Malt Records. Critical reception The album has received positive reviews from critics, with Album of the Year characterizing consensus as a 90 out of 100, based on two reviews. The editorial staff of AllMusic Guide gave the album four out of five stars, with reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine writing that it was an improvement over their first full-length, Old Liquidator, with catchy songwriting and \\"charmingly ragged pop-rock\\". The review in No Depression concurred with the charming nature of the songwriting, tying it stylistically to 1960s pop music and concluding that McCaughey's first major label album is deserved. In Entertainment Weekly, Steven Mirkin compared the sound to Merseybeat acts and gave the album an A for \\"casually perfect crystalline pop\\". Commercial performance The album reached 58 on CMJ New Music Monthlys Alternative Radio Airplay in August 1997. In 2003, McCaughey claimed in an interview that the album had only sold 5,000 copies, compared to the greater commercial success of some of some of the musicians who played on the album.

The road runs across the city in a northwest‚Äìsoutheast direction, terminating at NY 384 at its southern extent and NY 104 at its northern tip. Conceptually, the road, known as Hyde Park Boulevard, forms the eastern border of downtown Niagara Falls. It is the second-shortest two-digit route in New York after NY 71 in Columbia County. The NY 61 designation was in 1958 after being approved by the Niagara Falls City Council. Route description NY 61 northbound from NY 384 in Niagara Falls NY 61 begins at an intersection with NY 384 (Buffalo Avenue) on the industrial banks of the Niagara River in eastern Niagara Falls. The route, named Hyde Park Boulevard for its entire length, heads north initially as a city-maintained, undivided four-lane highway; after two blocks, the roadway widens and becomes maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation. NY 61 continues onward through the densely populated neighborhoods of Niagara Falls to Packard Road, where the route begins to parallel Gill Creek, a small stream leading south to the Niagara River. After five blocks, NY 61 intersects with Ferry Avenue, a one-way street carrying southbound U.S. Route 62 (US 62), in the area of the Niagara Falls Courthouse. NY 61 intersects with northbound US 62 three blocks later at Walnut Avenue. At the intersection, Gill Creek passes under both US 62 northbound and NY 61 as it switches to the east side of Hyde Park Boulevard. Gill Creek and NY 61 continue to run parallel for one more block before they separate ahead of Pine Avenue, once known as NY 62A and now designated as US 62 Business. The intersection between Pine and Hyde Park Boulevard marks the southwestern limits of Hyde Park, one of the largest parks in the vicinity of the city. For the next dozen blocks, NY 61 acts as the divider between the residential neighborhoods of downtown Niagara Falls and the open spaces of Hyde Park, passing Sal Maglie Stadium as it heads north. At Linwood Avenue, the homes return to both sides of NY 61 as it approaches Porter Road, which carries NY 182\\\\. While Porter Road ends here, NY 182 turns north, joining NY 61 for two blocks to Ontario Avenue, where NY 182 turns west toward the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge. NY 61 southbound approaching NY 31 in Niagara Falls North of Ontario Avenue, the buildings surrounding NY 61 become more commercial and industrial in nature as the route approaches the CSX Transportation Niagara Yard. It crosses over the western end of the yard before intersecting Lockport Road. The Niagara Falls Amtrak station, which Hyde Park Boulevard passes by but provides no access to, is located just off Lockport Road on 27th Street. Away from the yard, the surroundings become residential once more for another four blocks before entering a heavily industrial neighborhood around an intersection with NY 31\\\\. Farther north in Lewiston, the center turn lane becomes a hard median as it widens in preparation for a pseudo-interchange with Highland Avenue. The median reverts to its previous width shortly after Highland merges into Hyde Park Boulevard; however, the median ends two blocks later at a service road for the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant. NY 61, now a four-lane undivided highway once again, continues for another to the top of the Niagara River gorge, where it ends at NY 104 south of the Moses Power Plant and adjacent to the campus of Niagara University. History In 1958, New York State Department of Public Works asked the city of Niagara Falls to approve a route designation for Hyde Park Boulevard to include on the state maps. In October 1958, the city agreed on the designation of NY 61 for the road. In 1962, the bridge carrying Hyde Park Boulevard over Gill Creek at Walnut Avenue, in length and originally built in 1950, was reconstructed. Farther north, the bridge over the western end of the CSX Transportation Niagara Yard, at long, was completed in 1964. It was reconstructed in 1997.

Currently worship services at Beaverton Foursquare draw approximately 3,000 people weekly from a congregation numbering nearly 6000. History Beaverton Foursquare Church was founded by Bill Melton and his wife, Jean, in 1961. In 1964, the congregation purchased along Walker Road, which was then on the outskirts of Beaverton. The initial building project started in 1966 with the chapel being completed in 1968. The new building was dedicated by Rolf McPherson, son of Aimee Semple McPherson who founded the Foursquare denomination. The average weekly attendance at that time was 75 people. In 1973, Ron Mehl took over leadership of the church. During his time of leadership, the weekly attendance increased to over 5,000 people. A number of new building projects were completed in order to accommodate the growth of the church. This growth also resulted in the Heart of the Word radio ministry, broadcasting the sermons from Pastor Mehl. The staff of the church also increased to include many pastors and other employees. By 2000, the church had grown to 6,000 and was the largest church in Oregon. Local Outreach Beaverton Foursquare Church hosts a monthly Foster Parents' Night Out (FPNO) event which aims to provide date nights, and a break, to local foster families.

At some point between 1998 and 1999, passers-by began to attach bras to a rural fence. The fence gradually became a well known site as the number of bras grew to hundreds. The fence is located on a public road reserve, adjacent to farm property in the Cardrona Valley area southwest of Wanaka, near to Cardrona. Despite its popularity, there was disagreement over the value of the attraction. The bra fence stands today next to the Cardrona Distillery.  Origins  The Bra Fence began at some point between Christmas 1998 and New Year 1999, when four bras were attached to the wire fence alongside the road. The original reason for the bras being attached to the fence is unknown. News spread of the addition, which was left on the fence by the local landowners, and more bras began to appear. By the end of February there were some 60 bras, but at about this time they were all removed anonymously. This was reported in the local press, and the story gained widespread dissemination through the New Zealand media, leading to more bras appearing. The fence by the end of March 2006. By October 2000, the number of bras had reached around 200, and again the fence was cleared of bras. This time the story spread even wider, as the fence had become to some a quirky tourist attraction, and media sources from as far afield as Europe became interested in the fence. Due to this interest, the number of bras being added to the fence personally, or sent to be added, increased dramatically. In early 2006, the number of bras attached to the fence stood at close to 800. Controversy and removal Although some locals welcomed the fence and regarded it as a tourist attraction, others viewed it as an eyesore and embarrassment, and as a potential hazard to drivers using the road. Frequent legal attempts were consequently made to see it removed. These attempts were increased in early 2006, accompanied by a further removal of some 200 of the bras. Some locals claimed that a number of Japanese students who are being educated in nearby Wanaka could get offended by the fence, as well as many other Asians or South Africans. However, local sheep farmer John Lee, who had become the unofficial guardian of the site, refused to remove the bras from the fence, claiming that 90% of letters received about the fence were positive, and that the bras were the most photographed attraction in the area. On 28 April 2006, after discovering the fence rested on public road reserve, the local Council determined the bra fence was a \\"traffic hazard\\" and an \\"eyesore\\", and ordered the bras on the fence to be removed. The fence's removal led to an attempt to make the world's longest bra chain, at an annual festival in nearby Wanaka, later that year. The chain reached some 7,400 bras, over 100,000 short of the world record, but raised over $10,000 for charity.Wanaka, New Zealand attempts bra chain record , Newsgab.com, 19 September 2006, Retrieved on 25/8/07 References External links *Report on October 2000 vandalism *Home video of fence, March 2004 Category:Buildings and structures in Otago Category:Brassieres Category:1999 establishments in New Zealand Category:2006 disestablishments in New Zealand Category:Tourist attractions in Otago ","title":"Cardrona Bra Fence"},{"id":"4886610","text":"The lateral or orbital surface of the lacrimal bone is divided by a vertical ridge, the posterior lacrimal crest, into two parts.

The wetted perimeter is the perimeter of the cross sectional area that is \\"wet\\". The length of line of the intersection of channel wetted surface with a cross sectional plane normal to the flow direction. The term wetted perimeter is common in civil engineering, environmental engineering, hydrology, geomorphology, and heat transfer applications; it is associated with the hydraulic diameter or hydraulic radius. Engineers commonly cite the cross sectional area of a river. The wetted perimeter can be defined mathematically as :P = \\\\sum_{i=0}^\\\\infty{l_i} where li is the length of each surface in contact with the aqueous body. In open channel flow, the wetted perimeter is defined as the surface of the channel bottom and sides in direct contact with the aqueous body. Friction losses typically increase with an increasing wetted perimeter, resulting in a decrease in head. In a practical experiment, one is able to measure the wetted perimeter with a tape measure weighted down to the river bed to get a more accurate measurement. When a channel is much wider than it is deep, the wetted perimeter approximates the channel width.

Life and playing career Born in Tilbury, Essex, England, Evans played for Tilbury as an amateur and Charlton Athletic before Reds manager Don Welsh paid ¬£12,500 for his services on Christmas Day 1953, He made his debut, along with full-back Frank Lock, the following day in a Boxing Day fixture at Anfield, W.B.A were the visitors for the league match which ended in a goalless draw. His first goal for the club came a week later on 2 January 1954, again, in a league match at Anfield: this time Bolton Wanderers were the guests. Evans' second-minute strike wasn't enough to fend off the men from Burnden Park as Bolton won 2‚Äì1. Evans came to Liverpool with a good reputation for finding the back of the net having scored 38 goals in 90 appearances for Charlton, a goal every 2.3 games. He was soon into his stride in the red of Liverpool with a goal in his second appearance for the club. However, the club was going through its roughest phase of its history and Evans' eye for goal was affected only scoring 5 goals in the 16 matches he appeared in, not enough to stop Liverpool from being relegated to the Second Division. Evans is one of only three Liverpool FC players to score 5 goals in one game, the others being Ian Rush and Robbie Fowler. Evans was a regular fixture in the starting line-up in the Reds first season in the lower tier playing in 38 league games and four FA Cup matches, in fact he was only two appearances behind the great Billy Liddell who topped the appearance chart for the 1954‚Äì55 season. Evans did finish as the club's leading goalscorer though scoring 29 league and four cup goals compared to 30 league and one cup goal for Liddell, even though Liddell and Evans notched a more than healthy 59 goals between them it wasn't enough to gain Liverpool instant promotion back to the big time, they finished a very disappointing 11th 12 points behind champions Birmingham City, second placed Luton Town and third placed Rotherham United who all finished on 54 points. It was during this season that he became one of only three players to have scored five goals in one match for Liverpool, it happened on 15 September 1954 in a league match at Anfield and his victims were Bristol Rovers, his goals came in the 7th, 39th, 40th, 70th an 85th minutes and were, unsurprisingly, enough to see off Rovers even though they managed to score three in the 5‚Äì3 thriller. He also managed to score four when Liverpool travelled to Gigg Lane to face Bury. The following campaign, 1955‚Äì56, was less productive for Evans who scored 13 from 36 league and cup appearances, as Liverpool finished just outside the promotion places on 48 points, four shy of second placed Leeds United. The 1956‚Äì57 season wasn't the best for Evans as he only managed to hit the net twice from 11 outings as the Reds went with a certain Jimmy Melia. Evans only made one appearance at the beginning of the next campaign and after scoring a goal every other game during his time at Anfield he was allowed to leave in November 1957, he joined Colchester United where he managed to hit the net 22 times. Evans also went on to play for Romford, in his home county of Essex and Ford United as an amateur.

He is credited with the 1953 discovery of Gee's golden langur. He is notable as an early influential wildlife conservationist, especially for his 1959 and 1963 surveys and recommendations resulting in the creation of Chitwan National Park, the first of nine national parks in Nepal. Conservationist Gee was the fourth son of Rev. C. G. Gee, Vicar of Lowick and his wife, daughter of a Colonel Briggs of Hylton Castle. As a tea planter, Gee was part of a highly influential group of British landowners very close to the highest levels of provincial power. Soon after India's Independence, Gee was one of the first to assess the threats to endangered species and outline conservation measures to protect them. He believed cattle had no place in a sanctuary and thought they would arouse a sense of surprise, disappointment, and revulsion in tourists who had come looking for wild animals. Gee's golden langur named for E.P. Gee Like his contemporaries, Salim Ali and M. Krishnan, Gee was a non-official member of the Indian Board for Wildlife, the apex body that advises the Union Government on wildlife matters. Gee argued in favour of separate wildlife wardens within the Forest Department, who have specific powers in relation to fauna. He wrote extensively on the role of foresters as protectors of wildlife, as he thought it important to rely on their goodwill. He believed conservation success depended on cooperation between foresters and the forest ministers of each state and that the role of the central government was only to advise and assist. He is famous for his discovery of the langur species which is named after him, Gee's golden langur. He had heard reports of an unusual coloured primate and he organised an expedition in 1953. He managed to film the langurs near the Sankosh River on the border between Assam and Bhutan. Elephant safari in Chitwan National Park He recommended that the Govindgarh Palace of the Maharaja of Rewa, and its white tiger inhabitants, be made a \\"National Trust\\", which didn't happen. Great Indian one-horned rhinoceros at Kaziranga National Park In 1959, the Fauna Preservation Society appointed E.P. Gee to undertake a survey of the Chitwan Valley. Gee, who had spent most of his life in India and was an authority on its wildlife, recommended creation of a national park north of the Rapti River. He also proposed creation of a wildlife sanctuary south of the river for a trial period of ten years. In 1963, after he surveyed Chitwan again, this time for both the Fauna Preservation Society and the International Union for Conservation of Nature, Gee recommended extension of the national park to rhinoceros areas to the south of the river. In December 1970, His Majesty King Mahendra approved extension of the national park as recommended, thus creating the first national park in Nepal. After retirement from tea planting in Assam, Gee settled in Shillong, where he assembled one of the finest private orchid collections. After Independence, sensitive to the nationalism of the new Indian leadership, Gee searched for and emphasized indigenous nature conservation practices, ranging from ancient imperial edicts to village traditions of protecting nesting bird colonies. This cooperative and culturally sensitive style won recognition from Jawaharlal Nehru whom Gee accompanied together with Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi and son-in-law Feroze Gandhi on a tour of Kaziranga Wildlife Sanctuary on 20 October 1956. Nehru's forward to Gee's book in February 1964 was one of the only pieces he ever wrote on wildlife conservation. In it he said, Nehru called for more refuges for vanishing wildlife, but he died in May and Gee died four years later. It was the end of an era. Publications The Wildlife of India, 1964 first edition *E.P. Gee was an active contributor to the early wildlife protection policy of India. He wrote his own account of his wildlife work in the book Wildlife of India in 1964. This work makes a good comparison with present-day wildlife conservation efforts in India. :The Indian Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Environment and Forests since May 2009, Jairam Ramesh's acquaintance with the natural world began when he was nine (1963) and was gifted The Wildlife of India.

Its primary base is among employees of the Puerto Rico Department of Education. The FMPR was formed in 1960s by radical union activists. It currently has 32,000 members, making it one of the largest unions in Puerto Rico. The FMPR has recently disaffiliated from the American Federation of Teachers. A referendum within the union decided on a majority vote to disaffiliate with the AFT and the AFL-CIO. The details of the referendum were published on their website and the votes were counted by the teachers themselves according to official reports. The conflict between the two unions remained in limbo through January 2005, when hundreds of FMPR officers opposed to disaffiliation formally asked AFT to investigate the disaffiliation vote and the governing practices of President Feliciano. Though the AFT investigation alleged numerous violations of the democratic rights of FMPR members, the whole matter of who controlled the FMPR wound up in court in Puerto Rico. FMPR prevailed in the court proceedings. In April 2003 some of the union leadership including the president of the union were involved in violent protests which resulted in arrests and jail time for members of the union. On February 21, 2008, the FMPR officially declared a strike. Exactly nine days after it began, the FMPR declared the strike over.

A Republican, Libous was first elected to the State Senate in 1988. He won a total of 14 terms in the Senate, eventually rising to the position of Deputy Majority Leader. An influential Albany dealmaker, Libous was notable for his advocacy for New York's Southern Tier. On July 22, 2015, Libous forfeited his Senate seat when he was found guilty of lying to the FBI. His conviction was vacated following his death. Early life, education, and early career Libous was president of his senior class at Johnson City High School. At a young age, he worked at his family's grocery store in Binghamton. Libous graduated from Broome Community College in 1973 and from the State University of New York at Utica in 1975, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in Marketing and Finance with honors. He worked on political campaigns for his uncle, Alfred Libous, who served as Mayor of Binghamton. Libous, a Republican, was elected to the Binghamton City Council in 1983 and won re-election in 1987. New York State Senate career After having served on the Binghamton City Council, Libous was first elected to the New York State Senate in 1988. Libous was re-elected 13 times. He succeeded Senator Warren M. Anderson, who had served as Senate Majority Leader. Libous was a powerful presence in Albany, and was known for his advocacy for New York's Southern Tier. He was also known for his ability to work with members of both parties and for his strong working relationship with Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo. In 2008, Libous rose to the position of Deputy Majority Leader. In 2009, he played a major role in a parliamentary coup when Republicans unsuccessfully attempted to take control of the Senate with the help of two dissident Democrats. Also in 2009, he became chair of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee; in that capacity, he helped the Republicans retake the Senate majority the following year. Libous voted against same-sex marriage legislation that passed in 2011 and also voted against the 2013 gun control law known as the New York SAFE Act. Libous was an outspoken supporter of hydrofracking. In November 2014, despite having been indicted earlier in the year, Libous was re-elected for a fourteenth Senate term and remained Deputy Majority Leader. Libous forfeited his Senate seat when he was found guilty of lying to the FBI on July 22, 2015.Thomas Kaplan,Thomas Libous, New York State Senator, Is Convicted of Lying to F.B.I., New York Times, July 23, 2015. =Community projects and programs= Libous helped provide funding for an ice rink at Broome Community College and an events center at Binghamton University. He also supported the Ottawa Senators' American Hockey League affiliate's 2002 move to Binghamton, facilitating the provision of funding for arena renovations on multiple occasions. In 1998, Libous founded the Student Community Service Awards (SCSA) through a partnership with WBNG-TV and Broome- Tioga BOCES. Each year, the SCSA program awarded scholarships to high school seniors based on community volunteer work. One of Libous's final acts as Senator was to secure over $4 million in grant funds to construct the new shared office for the Broome County Industrial Development Agency, Broome County Chamber of Commerce, and related groups. Legal issues In 2012, Libous was highlighted in a corruption trial for his role in attempting to help his son, Matthew, receive a job at Santangelo, Randazzo & Mangone, a law firm in Westchester County. As a result, an investigation was started, and on July 1, 2014, he was indicted on charges of lying to the FBI regarding the circumstances of his son's employment at the law firm. Matthew Libous was charged with six counts of tax fraud in a related investigation. In January 2015, Matthew Libous was convicted on three counts of federal tax fraud by judge Vincent L. Briccetti of the Southern District of New York in a bench trial, and in May 2015 he was sentenced to six months in prison. Thomas Libous was tried in July 2015. On July 22, 2015, after approximately six hours of jury deliberations, Libous was convicted of one count of lying to the F.B.I.; because of the felony conviction, he forfeited his Senate seat. On November 24, 2015, U.S. District Judge Vincent Briccetti sentenced him to six months of house arrest, two years of probation and a $50,000 fine. Libous was not sentenced to jail time due to his terminal cancer. Libous appealed the conviction. On May 30, 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated his conviction and ordered the return of the fine to his estate because Libous had been appealing the conviction at the time of his death.

Vetala Panchavimshati (, IAST: ) or Baital Pachisi (\\"Twenty-five (tales) of Baital\\"), is a collection of tales and legends within a frame story, from India. It is also known as internationally Vikram-Betaal. It was originally written in Sanskrit. One of its oldest recensions is found in the 12th Book of the Kathasaritsagara (\\"Ocean of the Streams of Story\\"), a work in Sanskrit compiled in the 11th century by Somadeva, but based on yet older materials, now lost. This recension comprises in fact twenty-four tales, the frame narrative itself being the twenty-fifth. The two other major recensions in Sanskrit are those by ≈öivadƒÅsa and Jambhaladatta. The Vetala stories are popular in India and have been translated into many Indian vernaculars.Penzer 1924, Vol VI, p 225. Several English translations exist, based on Sanskrit recensions and on Hindi, Tamil, Bengali and Marathi versions.Penzer 1924, Vol VI, p 226. Probably best-known English version is that of Sir Richard Francis Burton which is, however, not a translation but a very free adaptation.Penzer 1924, Vol VI, p 227. Penzer goes on to observe \\"What Burton has really done is to use a portion of the VetƒÅla tales as a peg on which to hang elaborate 'improvements' entirely of his own invention.\\"  Plot  The legendary king VikramƒÅditya (Vikrama) promises a vamachari (a tantric sorcerer) that he will capture a vetala (or Baital), a celestial spirit Pishacha, celestial spirit analogous to a vampire in Western literature who hangs upside-down from a tree and inhabits and animates dead bodies. King Vikrama faces many difficulties in bringing the vetala to the tantric. Each time Vikram tries to capture the vetala, it tells a story that ends with a riddle. If Vikrama cannot answer the question correctly, the vampire consents to remain in captivity. If the king knows the answer but still keeps quiet, then his head shall burst into thousand pieces. And if King Vikrama answers the question correctly, the vampire would escape and return to his tree. He knows the answer to every question; therefore the cycle of catching and releasing the vampire continues twenty-four times. Father and son meet mother and daughter, in the Baital's final tale. Illustration by Perham Wilhelm Nahl from Arthur W. Ryder's Twenty-two Goblins. On the twenty-fifth attempt, the Vetala tells the story of a father and a son in the aftermath of a devastating war. They find the queen and the princess alive in the chaos, and decide to take them home. In due time, the son marries the queen and the father marries the princess. Eventually, the son and the queen have a son, and the father and the princess have a daughter. The vetala asks what the relation between the two newborn children is. The question stumps Vikrama. Satisfied, the vetala allows himself to be taken to the tantric. Vikram prepares to behead the tantric. Illustration by Ernest Griset from Burton's Vikram and the Vampire. On their way to the tantric, Vetala tells his story. His parents did not have a son and a tantric blessed them with twin sons on a condition that both be educated under him. Vetala was taught everything in the world but often ill-treated. Whereas his brother was taught just what was needed but always well treated. Vetala came to know that the tantric planned to give his brother back to his parents and Vetala instead would be sacrificed as he was an 'all-knowing kumara' and by sacrificing him the tantric could be immortal and rule the world using his tantric powers. Vetal also reveals that now the tantric's plan is to sacrifice Vikram, beheading him as he bowed in front of the goddess. Then tantric could then gain control over the vetala and sacrifice his soul, thus achieving his evil ambition. The vetala suggests that the king asks the tantric how to perform his obeisance, then take advantage of that moment to behead the sorcerer himself. VikramƒÅditya does exactly as told by vetala and he is blessed by Lord Indra and Devi Kali. The vetala offers the king a boon, whereupon Vikram requests that the tantric's heart and mind be cleaned of all sins and his life be restored as a good living being and that the vetala would come to the king's aid when needed. =Variation= A variation of this story replaces the vetal with a minor celestial who, in exchange for his own life, reveals the plot by two tradesmen (replacing the sorcerer) to assassinate Vikrama and advises Vikrama to trick them into positions of vulnerability as described above. Having killed them, Vikrama is offered a reward by the goddess, who grants him two spirits loyal to Her as his servants. Other media =Films= It was adapted into 1951 Hindi film Jai Maha Kali (Vikram Vaital) by Dhirubhai Desai starring Lalita Pawar, Nirupa Roy, Shahu Modak, Raj Kumar, S. N. Tripathi.

Another 2006 supernatural sitcom Vicky & Vetaal was inspired by it. A web series titled The Vetala was released in 2009, written and directed by Damon Vignale. The series reveals a CGI vetala character in the final episode. 2018 Hindi TV adaptation Vikram Betaal Ki Rahasya Gatha was aired on &TV;, where actors Aham Sharma and Makrand Deshpande as playing the role of King Vikramaditya and Betaal respectively. =Literature= The children's Chandamama, featured a serial story titled New Tales of Vikram and Betal for many years. As the title suggests, the original premise of the story is maintained, as new stories are told by Vetala to King Vikrama. In the novel, Alif the Unseen, a character named Vikrama the Vampire appears as a jinn. He tells how thousands of years ago, King Vikrama had set off to defeat the Vetala, a vampire jinn terrorizing one of his villages. Vikrama won the Vetala's game of wits, but forfeited his life. The Vetala now inhabits his body.http://aliftheunseen.com/ Recensions, editions, and translations =Sanskrit= Both the K·π£emendra and Somadeva recensions derive from the unattested \\"Northwestern\\" B·πõhatkathƒÅ, and include the Vetala Tales as a small part of their huge inventory.

Wilden published numerous books and articles which intersect a number of fields, including systems theory, film theory, structuralism, cybernetics, psychiatry, anthropological theory, water control projects, urban ecosystems, resource conservation, and communications and social relations.\\"Biography - Wilden, Anthony (1935-)\\", Contemporary Authors (Biography), Thomson Gale, 2002. Wilden is credited with one of the first significant introductions to the work of Jacques Lacan in the Anglo-Saxon world, particularly in his role as one of Lacan's early English translators.ie., as early as 1966, Wilden's \\"Freud, Signorelli and Lacan: the Repression of the Signifier\\" (1966, American Imago, 23: 332‚Äì66) and his English translation of Lacan's The Language of the Self (published in 1968)see also the Anthony Wilden article at the French Wikipedia site here Today Wilden's work (and consequent reputation) is arguably more influential in the fields of communication theory, ecology and social interaction. These fields of study evolved out of a long scholarly tradition of \\"interactional semiotics\\" that originated with Plato's Cratylus. Along with such figures as Gregory Bateson (i.e., Steps to an Ecology of Mind), R. D. Laing (i.e., Sanity, Madness and the Family), and Walker Percy (i.e., Lost in the Cosmos), Wilden is considered one of this tradition's contemporary (modern and postmodern) pioneers. With the appearance of System and Structure (1972), Wilden sought \\"to establish the necessity of an ecosystemic or ecological approach to communication and exchange in open systems of all types\\", to use his own words.\\"Preface\\", p. xiv. System and Structure: Essays in Communication and Exchange, 1st ed., Tavistock Publications, 1972 In hindsight it is recognized that System and Structure was an early contribution to a \\"theory of self-referential systems\\". According to Niklas Luhmann, this \\"theory of self- referential systems\\" is the second paradigm change\\"change\\" or what Gregory Bateson called a \\"step\\" in a \\"General System Theory\\" (the first change being the \\"open-systems\\" or \\"systems/environment\\" shift, a step that initially separated \\"systems theory\\" from the traditional \\"whole-parts\\" paradigm).Luhmann, Niklas. Social Systems. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1995; pp. 6‚Äì8 Through his teaching and writings, Wilden provided \\"a contribution to our 'knowledge about knowledge' at an abstract level, as well as supplying ammunition in the struggle with the concrete reality that information is power and that scientific discourse is a hidden weapon in the arsenal of social control.\\" Wilden is also recognized today for his significant contributions to Context theory and Second-order cybernetics. Wilden was a professor in the Communications Department at Simon Fraser University from the 1970s to the mid-1990s. He attended the University of Victoria, Victoria, British Columbia, 1960‚Äì1961, 1963‚Äì1965; and Johns Hopkins University, earning his PhD in 1968.

Winter swimming is the activity of swimming during the winter season, typically in outdoor locations (open water swimming) or in unheated pools or lidos. In colder countries it may be synonymous with ice swimming, when the water is frozen over. This requires either breaking the ice or entering where a spring prevents the formation of ice. It may also be simulated by a pool of water at , the temperature at which water freezes. In Eastern Europe and Russia, winter swimming is part of the celebration of the Epiphany. Competitions for winter swimming also exist. Many winter swimmers swim with standard swimming costumes rather than with wetsuits or other thermal protection. Famous ice and winter swimmers include Lynne Cox and Lewis Gordon Pugh. Also, many locations in North America and Western Europe hold polar bear plunges, commonly to celebrate New Year's Day, although participants are not expected to swim and generally most do not swim. International winter and ice swimming competitions take place around the world with two of the larger organizing bodies being the International Ice Swimming Association and the International Winter Swimming Association. Both organizations have similar competition guidelines including water temperatures typically below , a pool often cut out of frozen bodies of water, and swimmers limited to goggles, one standard bathing suit, and one latex or silicone cap - neoprene is not allowed.  Maintaining the hole in the ice  One way that the hole is maintained at regular ice swimming places is with a pump that forces the water to circulate under the hole, preventing ice from forming. Small ice-holes can also be kept open by keeping a lid/top over the hole to prevent ice forming. Most ice swimming places also use a specific heated \\"carpet\\" going from the locker rooms to the ice-hole, both to make walking to the hole more pleasant and for safety as otherwise the water dripping from returning swimmers would freeze and create a dangerously slippery surface to walk on.  National traditions  = Northern Europe = Ice swimming in Estonia in 1972 In Finland, Northern Russia, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia the ice swimming tradition has been connected with the sauna tradition. Unlike dousing, it is not seen as an ascetic or religious ritual, but a way to cool off rapidly after staying in a sauna and as a stress relief. Ice swimming (avantouinti) on its own is especially popular in Estonia and Finland. There is an Avantouinti Society, and swimming holes are also maintained by other groups such as the Finnish skiing association (Suomen Latu). The Finnish Sauna Society maintains an avanto for sauna goers. There are many places to swim without sauna in Finland during winter. Helsinki has several places for avantouinti, with dressing-rooms and sometimes with saunas. There is also a number of ice swimming and winter sauna locations around Tampere. = Oceania =  Australia  The Bronte Splashers Winter Swimming Club claims to be the oldest Winter Swimming club in the world founded in 1921.http://www.brontesplashers.com.au/ It competes against Bondi Icebergs Winter Swimming Club, South Maroubra Dolphins Winter Swimming Club, Cronulla Polar Bears Winter Swimming Club, Maroubra Seals Winter Swimming Club, Coolangatta Surf Life Saving Club, Clovelly Eskimos Winter Swimming Club, Coogee Penguins Winter Swimming Club, Wollongong Whales and Cottesloe Crabs in the Winter Swimming Association of Australia Championships. = Western Europe =  United Kingdom  Famous locations include the Serpentine Lake in Hyde Park, London, and Highgate Ponds in Hampstead. The largest fresh water pool in the UK is the Tooting Bec Lido in South West London which is home to the South London Swimming Club. The pool is in length, i.e. nearly twice as long as an Olympic pool. As the winter approaches and the water temperature drops then swimmers stay in for less and less time, swimming just one or two widths rather than several lengths. Races take place all year including on Christmas Day and New Year's Day. The Middle Yeo Surf Life Saving Club hold the annual New Year's Day swim in Clevedon. It is usually held 20 minutes before high tide or if the times are not conducive to a large crowd the swim is held in Marine Lake. The Middle Yeo Surf Life Saving Club swim every weekend of the year and the forthcoming swim times are published in their alcove in Top Beach, Clevedon. The Chester Frosties are an informal facebook group of over 1,000 swimmers who swim all year around Cheshire, Lancashire, Wirral, Merseyside and North Wales. Local specialities include tidal bore and surge swimming on the River Dee. Sheffield Outdoor Plungers are another informal Facebook group of 3,000 swimmers who swim in locations all over the Peak District and Sheffield area, and campaign for better access to waters.  Belgium  There are some clubs where people swim all year in a pool, a lake, or a river. Locations are Bruges, Boom, Deurne Dendermonde, Wachtebeek, Theux and Huy. The most famous race is across the Meuse river each last Sunday of February since 1963.  Germany  The International Ice Swimming Association hosts an official ice swimming event at the W√∂hrsee, a lake in Burghausen.  Switzerland  In Geneva the yearly Coupe de No√´l is an event organized in december since 1934. Around 2,500 participants, many of them dressed up, swim in Lake Geneva. = China = There are reportedly 141 winter swimming organisations across China with a membership of more than 200,000. The younger swimmers are under ten years of age and the older ones in their 80s. In Beijing, there are the winter swimming places such as Shichahai (‰ªÄÂàπÊµ∑), Yu Yuantan (ÁéâÊ∏äÊΩ≠) and Xihu swimming pool in Qinghua University, etc. In Harbin, northern China, many ice swim in the Songhua River. Also Jinan is a place of annual winter swimming festival. The big event is swimming across Daming Lake about . In Taiyuan, where air temperature often goes below in winter, hundreds of men and women ice swim each day in the Fen River. In Dalian, a coastal city in northeast China, hundreds of people swim in the sea in winter. Most people choose to go to the beach at noon. Some of them are concentrated in several beaches in the city, such as Fujiazhuang beach, Xinghai Square beach and Shicao beach. At Bangchuidao Island beach, there are also some swimmers who choose to go swimming in the sea before sunrise. Jinan is also the site of annual Chinese national winter swimming festivals since 2014, as an international invitational festival (in 2019 attended by approx. 990 winter swimmers from 12 countries, still according chinese rules) since 2016, and, from season 2019/2020, as the International Winter Swimming Association (IWSA) 3rd stage of World Cup already according to IWSA international rules. Besides competitions in swimming pool created in lake the main event and longest discipline of competitions is swimming 300 m (980 ft) from Huxin Island to the venue of the World Cup. = Eastern Europe and Russia = An ice hole is cut in the form of a cross in Russia to celebrate the Epiphany In Russia ice swimming could have been existed since pagan times. During the times of Moscovian Russia swimming in ice holes was a popular tradition. Records are dating the tradition back to as early as 1525. It was also an important court ceremony and a folk custom in Tsardom of Russia. In Russia and other Eastern European countries where Eastern Orthodox Christianity is the prevalent religion ice swimming is connected with the celebration of the Epiphany. The Epiphany is observed on 19 January according to the Julian calendar of the Russian Orthodox Church. The day marks the baptism of Jesus in the River Jordan. To celebrate this, holes are cut in the ice on rivers, lakes or other bodies of water, usually in the form of a Christian or Orthodox cross. Around midnight, believers submerge themselves three times in the water to honour the Holy Trinity, after a priest says a prayer. Ice swimming on the Epiphany is relatively new. It was practised by only a few before the October Revolution of 1917 and occurred even less frequently in the time of the Soviet Union, when Christians were persecuted. However, the ritual became very popular in the 1990s since the Dissolution of the Soviet Union. In Moscow alone, 30,000 believers swam in ice holes in 37 fonts during the Epiphany of 2010. There is a popular belief that the practice erases a person's sins, but this is not endorsed by the Russian Orthodox Church. Ice swimming is also practised during the entire winter by Walrus Clubs, whose members are called \\"walruses\\" (, \\"morzhi\\"). In other Eastern European countries such as Bulgaria and Romania, the Epiphany is celebrated on 6 January. There it is tradition for Orthodox priests to cast wooden crosses in the water, which are then retrieved by the believers. It is popularly believed that the person who finds the cross is freed from evil spirits. Other countries where this is done include Serbia and Montenegro. = North America = The members of Canadian and American \\"polar bear clubs\\" go outdoor bathing or swimming in the middle of winter. In some areas, it is unusual or ceremonial enough to attract press coverage. \\"Polar bear plunges\\" are conducted as fund-raisers for charity, notably the Special Olympics. Cosmo Kramer briefly joins a New York polar bears club in the sitcom Seinfeld. The Russian immigrant professor Louis Sugarman of Little Falls, NY was the first American to become a famous ice swimmer in the 1890s. He attracted worldwide attention for his daily plunge in the Mohawk River, even when the thermometer hit , earning him the nickname \\"the human polar bear\\". The Coney Island Polar Bears club in the water on December 22, 2013 The oldest ice swimming club in the United States is the Coney Island Polar Bear Club of Coney Island, New York, founded in 1903 by Bernarr MacFadden. The club organizes an annual polar plunge on New Year's Day as well as regular swims in the Atlantic Ocean every Sunday from November to April.  Health risks  Winter swimming can be dangerous to people who are not used to swimming in very cold water. After submersion in cold water the cold shock response will occur, causing an uncontrollable gasp for air. This is followed by hyperventilation, a longer period of more rapid breathing. The gasp for air can cause a person to ingest water, which leads to drowning. As blood in the limbs is cooled and returns to the heart, this can cause fibrillation and consequently cardiac arrest. The cold shock response and cardiac arrest are the most common causes of death related to cold water immersion. Winter swimming isn't dangerous for healthy persons, but should be avoided by individuals with heart or respiratory diseases, obesity, high blood pressure and arrhythmia, as well as children and the elderly. Through conditioning, experienced winter swimmers have a greater resistance to effects of the cold shock response. Hypothermia poses a smaller risk. According to Tucker and Dugas, it takes more than approximately 30 minutes even in water until the body temperature drops low enough for hypothermia to occur. Many people would probably be able to survive for almost an hour. There is no consensus on these figures however; according to different estimates a person can survive for 45 minutes in water, but exhaustion or unconsciousness is expected to occur within 15 minutes. Consuming alcohol before winter swimming should be avoided because it speeds the onset and progression of hypothermia. Care should be taken when winter swimming in swimming pools and seas near the polar regions. The chlorine added to water in swimming pools and the salt in seawater allow the water to remain liquid at sub-zero temperatures. Swimming in such water is significantly more challenging and dangerous. The experienced winter swimmer Lewis Gordon Pugh swam near the North Pole in water and suffered a frostbite injury in his fingers. It took him four months to regain sensation in his hands.  Health benefits  Although there are risks associated with the practice, scientific studies also provide some evidence for the following health benefits. When compared to a control group on the profile of mood states rating scale, winter swimmers experience less stress and fatigue and more vigor. They report to have a better memory function, better mood and feel more energetic, active and brisk. Swimmers who suffer from rheumatism, fibromyalgia or asthma report that winter swimming relieves pain. There are indications that winter swimmers do not contract diseases as often as the general population. The incidence of infectious diseases affecting the upper respiratory tract is 40% lower among winter swimmers when compared to a control group. Short term exposure of the whole body to cold water produces oxidative stress, which makes winter swimmers develop improved antioxidative protection.

Plot summary The protagonist of the story is Elizabeth, a young woman who is taking time away from college to earn a bit of money and discover a sense of direction. By happenstance, she ends up landing in Baltimore near the home of Mrs. Pamela Emerson, a recent widow and the mother of seven grown children. Seeing Mrs. Emerson struggling to store her porch furniture in the garage for the winter, she stops to offer help and ends up becoming Mrs. Emerson's handyman and companion. The story, which spans 14 years, discusses the relationship between first Elizabeth and Mrs. Emerson and then the relationship between Elizabeth and several of Mrs. Emerson's children, particularly Timothy and Matthew. Elizabeth and the Emersons end up changing each other's lives in fundamental ways. Novels‚Äô Place in the Evolution of Tyler‚Äôs Writing The Clock Winder could be called Tyler‚Äôs ‚Äúforgotten novel,‚Äù as it received little recognition, few reviews, and little financial success when it appeared in 1972. Tyler herself considered this, her fourth novel, to be one she is a bit ashamed of, along with the three that preceded it.Willrich, Patricia R. (Summer, 1992) \\"Watching through Windows: A Perspective on Anne Tyler,\\" The Virginia Quarterly Review, Charlottesville, Virginia: University of Virginia. However, she also acknowledges that her writing improved considerably with her third and fourth novels, so that her fifth novel, Celestial Navigation, is one that she now considers ‚Äúher favorite.‚Äù Tyler, Anne (1980) \\"Still Just Writing,\\" reprinted in Sternberg, Janet (2000) The Writer on her Work, vol. 1 New York: W.W. Norton, pp. 3-16 In his 2003 Washington Post review, Jonathan Yardley points how The Clock Winder, while flawed, presaged several characteristics of her subsequent novels: For one, it was her first novel set chiefly in Roland Park, Baltimore. More significantly, it is her first in which a major focus is on complex relationships within large idiosyncratic families, and the forces that drive the family members apart, as well as those that continue to pull them back together over time.Yardley, Jonathan (October 22, 2003)\\"The Clock Winder\\" \\"'The Clock Winder': A Look Back to What Makes Anne Tyler Tick,‚Äù Washington Post, p. C01.

Biography Huntington was awarded the B.A. and the M.A. by Harvard University in 1895 and 1897, respectively. After two years' teaching at Williams College, he began a doctorate at the University of Strasbourg, which was awarded in 1901. He then spent his entire career at Harvard, retiring in 1941. He taught in the engineering school, becoming Professor of Mechanics in 1919. Although Huntington's research was mainly in pure mathematics, he valued teaching mathematics to engineering students. He advocated mechanical calculators and had one in his office. He had an interest in statistics, unusual for the time, and worked on statistical problems for the USA military during World War I. Huntington's primary research interest was the foundations of mathematics. He was one of the \\"American postulate theorists\\" (according to Michael Scanlan, the expression is due to John Corcoran), American mathematicians active early in the 20th century (including E. H. Moore and Oswald Veblen) who proposed axiom sets for a variety of mathematical systems. In so doing, they helped found what is now known as metamathematics and model theory. Scanlan, M. (1991) \\"Who were the American Postulate Theorists?\\", Journal of Symbolic Logic 56, 981‚Äì1002. Huntington was perhaps the most prolific of the American postulate theorists, devising sets of axioms (which he called \\"postulates\\") for groups, abelian groups, geometry, the real number field, and complex numbers. His 1902 axiomatization of the real numbers has been characterized as \\"one of the first successes of abstract mathematics\\" and as having \\"filled the last gap in the foundations of Euclidean geometry\\". Huntington excelled at proving axioms independent of each other by finding a sequence of models, each one satisfying all but one of the axioms in a given set. His 1917 book The Continuum and Other Types of Serial Order was in its day \\"...a widely read introduction to Cantorian set theory\\" (Scanlan 1999). Yet Huntington and the other American postulate theorists played no role in the rise of axiomatic set theory then taking place in continental Europe. In 1904, Huntington put Boolean algebra on a sound axiomatic foundation. He revisited Boolean axiomatics in 1933, proving that Boolean algebra required but a single binary operation (denoted below by infix '+') that commutes and associates, and a single unary operation, complementation, denoted by a postfix prime. The only further axiom Boolean algebra requires is: :(a '+b ')'+(a '+b)' = a, now known as Huntington's axiom. Revising a method from Joseph Adna Hill, Huntington is credited with the method of equal proportions or Huntington‚ÄìHill method of apportionment of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives to the states, as a function of their populations determined in the U.S. Census. This mathematical algorithm has been used in the U.S. since 1941 and is currently the method used. In 1919, Huntington was the third President of the Mathematical Association of America, which he helped found as a charter member and its first vice- president.MAA presidents: E. V.

It is the only woodpecker that breeds on the Arabian Peninsula. This species was first described in 1935 by the American naturalist George Latimer Bates and the Scottish zoologist Norman Boyd Kinnear, the scientific name being proposed by their occasional co-worker, the British Arabist St John Philby, in honour of his wife Dora. Some taxonomic authorities continue to place the species in Dendrocopos, while others place it genus Dendropicos. Description The Arabian woodpecker grows to a length of about . The male has a brownish or pale grey head with a bright red patch on the crown and nape. The back, wings, and tail are olive-grey to brown streaked with white, and the wings are barred with white. The underparts are grey streaked with white and the belly has the central area suffused with red. The female is similar but lacks the red crown patch. The call has been rendered as \\"pweek pit-pit-pit-pit-pit-pit-pit-ptptpt\\" and the bird occasionally drums on branches. Distribution and habitat The species is endemic to the mountains and foothills of the southwestern part of the Arabian Peninsula, being restricted to southwestern Saudi Arabia and western Yemen. It is found in a range of woodland habitats including, at lower altitudes, patches of Ficus, date palm and Pandanus. It is present in evergreen riparian forested corridors, on shading trees in coffee plantations, in orchards, on terraced cropland with isolated trees, and in woods and spinneys of Acacia, juniper, olive and Dracaena. Its altitudinal range is from sea level to but it probably only breeds between about . Behaviour Like other woodpeckers, the Arabian woodpecker feeds on insect grubs which it extracts from holes in tree trunks and branches with its long tongue. It also feeds on spiders, aphids, fig-wasps and flying insects. The nest is in a hole in the trunk or branch of a tree, usually below , excavated in dead wood. The main breeding season is from March to May, but a second brood is sometimes reared in November in Yemen. Status D. dorae is an uncommon bird, and the total number of mature individuals is estimated to be less than ten thousand. The population trend is probably downward as the bird's habitat is being degraded by the removal of trees for firewood and charcoal manufacture, and the clearance of wooded land for agriculture. Overgrazing by livestock means there is little regeneration of trees in some areas. For these reasons, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this bird's conservation status as \\"Near Threatened\\".

Life =Early career= Jean Orry was born in Paris on 4 September 1652 to Charles Orry, a merchant, and Madelaine le Cosquyno. Orry studied law and entered Royal service as a lawyer, becoming a munitioneer for the army of Italy between 1690 and 1698, where he was able to demonstrate his skill at planning and organisation. In 1701, at the start of the Spanish War of Succession, Orry purchased his nobility and became an adviser to Louis XIV of France. =Work in Spain= Orry was sent to Spain by King Louis in 1701. There, Orry joined the self-styled Princesse des Ursins as the de facto rulers of Spain. Towards the end of his term there, by a royal decree composed by Orry on 23 December 1713, traditional local governments (the Cortes) were centralized by the creation of twenty-one provinces. These Consejos Territoriales were superseded by an intendant directly responsible to Orry. Some of the local councils, such as the Council of Castile retained influence through less direct channels. =Dismissal from Spain= Orry was dismissed through pressures brought to bear by the Parmesan contingent round the new queen, Elisabetta Farnese, and Giulio Alberoni. Orry was ordered from Spain on 7 February 1715. The King signed the Decreto de Nueva Planta later that year, revoking most of the historical rights and privileges of the different kingdoms that conformed the Spanish Crown, unifying them under the laws of Castile, where the Cortes regained some of its power. =Legacy= Giulio Alberoni, the cardinal who succeeded him in power, continued the main lines of his financial reorganization and his repression of the power of the royal councils in favour of a bureaucracy wholly dependent upon the central power. Orry's creation of secretaries of state and intendants continued as a significant element in Spanish governmental administration.

It seeks to \\"increase knowledge of the Middle East among the citizens of the United States and to promote a better understanding between the people of these two areas\\". History =Founding years= In 1946, architect George Camp Keiser felt strongly that the Middle East, a region he had traveled through before World War II, should be better understood in the United States, so he brought together a group of like-minded people to form the Middle East Institute in Washington, D.C. His colleagues on the original Board of Governors included Halford L. Hoskins, Director of the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS); Christian A. Herter, then-congressman from Massachusetts and later Dwight Eisenhower's Secretary of State; Ambassador George V. Allen; Harold Glidden, Director of the Islamic Department at the Library of Congress; and Harvey P. Hall, the first Editor of the Middle East Journal, professor at the American University of Beirut and Robert College. Keiser was also MEI's chief source of financial support. In 1946, the Institute found a temporary home at 1906 Florida Avenue NW at SAIS. At the time, they have linked administratively through the Diplomatic Affairs Foundation, the parent organization of both SAIS and MEI. In its early years, MEI concentrated on establishing a library, publishing the Middle East Journal, holding annual conferences and sponsoring formal courses in Middle East studies at SAIS. Keiser and his group recognized the need for studying the Middle East using the framework of area studies. This interdisciplinary approach to training diplomats and businesspeople was a new phenomenon at the time and as such closely linked to foreign policy initiatives in the United States. During its founding years, the Institute was small, its membership resembling that of a club. The annual conference, held at the Friends Meeting House on Florida Avenue, brought together a close-knit group of approximately 150 people accustomed to writing short articles for the Institute's newsletter to inform fellow members about their trips to the Middle East. George Camp Keiser: founder of the Institute George Camp Keiser was born on November 2, 1900, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. After graduating from Harvard University with a Bachelor of Arts in 1924, he went to Columbia University to complete his graduate degree in Architecture by 1930. Over the following years, he worked as a draftsman for David Hyer and James Gamble Rogers until he opened his own practice in 1938. Following his younger brother's career path, Keiser also became director of the Cuban-American Sugar Company and the Guantanamo Sugar Company. George Keiser built his family home inspired by Islamic architecture, showcasing his fascination with the Middle East and Middle Eastern architecture in particular. In 1947, he founded the Middle East Institute. During World War II, Keiser was a first lieutenant in the U.S. Signal Corps. Further positions held over the course of his life include trustee of the Foreign Service Educational Foundation, the American Research Center in Egypt, and the Visitors Committee of the Harvard Center for Middle Eastern Studies. He was also a member of the American Institute of Architects and president of the Symphony Orchestra of Central Florida. He died on March 23, 1956, after a brief illness and was buried in Wilton, Connecticut. =The 1950s= MEI continuously built its reputation by creating a language- as well as a publications program; St John Philby's Arabian Highlands was published for MEI by Cornell University Press in 1952. MEI also increased the number of lectures, art exhibits, and conferences. Themes of annual conferences like \\"The Evolution of Public Responsibility in the Middle East\\" (1955), \\"Current Tensions in the Middle East\\" (1956), and \\"Neutralism, Communism: The Struggle for Power\\" (1959) reflected the post-World War II uncertainties about the Middle East. After having split from SAIS in 1948, MEI needed to find a new location. After spending a year at 2002 P Street, Keiser discovered and negotiated in late 1954 the purchase of two inter-connecting townhouses in the Dupont Circle neighborhood at 1761‚Äì1763 N Street NW with a joint garden and carriage house. The house, formerly occupied by Senator James B. Eustis and by architect Henry Ives Cobb, is MEI's current location. Keiser's death in 1956 triggered a period of re-evaluation. Edwin M. Wright took over as the second president until 1960, with Angus Sinclair briefly serving in 1958. =The 1960s= Following Keiser's death, MEI faced financial troubles. A series of part-time presidents including Edwin M. Wright, James Terry Duce, and Kermit Roosevelt, Jr., who all served in addition to their professional or business responsibilities, chiefly launched new projects with the hope that they would be self-supporting. Among these were Lands East, an illustrated magazine, and the Middle East Report of the Week, an \\"insiders\\" newsletter which was produced on a mimeograph machine. By 1966, MEI realized it could not survive without full-time leadership. Ambassador Raymond A. Hare stabilized the organization at a relatively low level of activity appropriate with its resources, concentrating on fundraising and expanding the base of corporate donations. As a result of these efforts, additional projects were financed by the Ford Foundation, a few conferences were organized for the U.S. Department of State, and the Rockefeller Foundation financed a series of discussion dinners. Georgetown University invited the Institute to hold its annual conference there, providing free accommodations and volunteer staff. In 1969, Ambassador Parker T. Hart led MEI into renewed activity. His vision for MEI to become an important national player led to an increased number of programs (like an annual conference on Middle East Business) and partnerships across the country and the world, a new internship program for undergraduate and graduate students, renewal of the MEI language program, and the publication of the Middle East Problem Papers. 1971 MEI Logo =The 1970s= The 1970s were marked by an unprecedented number of timely programs and events, many on the Cold War. Panels on Soviet Aims and Interests such as \\"The Arab‚ÄìIsraeli Conflict in View of the U.S.‚ÄìSoviet Conflict\\", and \\"The Strategic and Political Dimensions on the Cold War\\" meant to provide the public with in- depth information. Furthermore, MEI started a program called \\"Dialogue\\" in 1974 in cooperation with the Arabist Travel Program. It sent small teams of scholars and students to seven Arab countries. The program was repeated in 1978, funded by the United States Information Agency and the State Department. MEI also introduced The Middle East Monitor, an insider newsletter, published between 1971 and 1975. Its logo is the source of MEI's current logo, which is adapted from the design on a 10th-century platter unearthed near Nishapur, Iran, and now in the collections of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. =The 1980s= Taking on the role of the MEI president in 1975, L. Dean Brown served until 1986‚Äîthe longest presidential tenure in MEI's history. Under Ambassador Brown, MEI focused on business and investment opportunities between the Middle East and the United States. The 1980s also saw a continued increase in MEI's research and program ventures on issues like the theocracy of Iranian Islamic Clergy and Egyptian perceptions of the U.S. presence in Egypt. After having already served a short term as MEI's president from 1974 to 1975, Ambassador Lucius D. Battle returned from 1986 to 1990. Under his leadership, MEI absorbed the functions of the American Institute for Islamic Affairs (AIIA), dedicated to the Sultan Qaboos bin Said Research Center, and its endowment. He and then-Vice President Ambassador Christopher Van Hollen also began a tradition of traveling throughout the Middle East to gain support for MEI's mission. =The 1990s= The MEI's agenda in the 1990s was shaped by persistent volatility in the Persian Gulf States, the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli peace process, women in the Arab world, and contentious U.S. foreign policy. Ambassador Robert Keeley succeeded Ambassador Brown and served as President until 1995. During his tenure, MEI became a leading source for information on the Persian Gulf region, in particular, organized its first language-focused trip to the Middle East, set up a meeting between Israeli and Palestinian officials in Cairo, and renovated the building extensively. The next man to assume this post was Ambassador Roscoe S. Suddarth, who stayed on as President until 2001. During this time, the Foundation for Middle East Peace began renting space in the building (1996) and MEI celebrated its 50th anniversary. Furthermore, MEI established the Public Policy Center in 1999, bringing together MEI scholars-in-residence and adjunct scholars to provide expert commentaries on pressing issues in the Middle East. =The 2000s= Ambassador Edward S. Walker, Jr., assumed the presidency in 2001 and left the post in 2006. Walker highlighted America's struggle with the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict, the challenge of global terrorism, and the Iraq War. In 2007, Ambassador Wendy Chamberlin became the first woman to hold this position. She was succeeded in 2018 by Dr. Paul Salem, the current president. =The 2010s and funding= UAE Ambassador Yousef Al Otaiba has been active in Washington and has been acting as an envoy at the MEI. UAE is contributing $20 million over the course of 2016 and 2017 to the Middle East Institute. Media has sourced from Otaiba's leaked emails that on the orders of his boss Mohammed bin Zayed, crown prince of Abu Dhabi, he has been actively influencing White House to think tanks.Tomgram: Ben Freeman, How to Buy Foreign-Policy Expertise, February 21, 2019 During 2016‚àí2017, UAE and Saudi sources were the largest contributors to MEI, in addition to oil and military supply companies.Public Disclosures and Funding, MEI, Public Disclosures and Funding Organizational structure =Programs= The Middle East Institute hosts public events, which range from panel presentations and book signings to roundtables and policy workshops. MEI invites experts from the Middle East and around the world to participate in its programs and conferences. Its larger events include annual conferences on Turkey and Egypt, as well as its main event of each year, the Annual Conference and Banquet, held in November. =Communications= The Institute's roster of over 40 scholars is composed of former U.S. ambassadors, government officials, and top academics and analysts. Together, MEI's scholars possess decades of experience and expertise in the Middle East. They are routinely called upon by domestic and international media outlets to provide informed commentary and analysis of events and key issues in the region. MEI Scholars are regularly quoted in major media outlets such as NPR, BBC, and Al Jazeera, among many others. MEI Scholars take the conversation beyond the Beltway by publishing op-eds in national and international newspapers including the Washington Post, the New York Times, Politico, and Foreign Policy. =Publications= The Publications Department is best known for the quarterly Middle East Journal, MEI's only print publication. In addition to the Journal, analyses and opinion pieces are posted on the website. Additionally, the members-only bulletin @MEI is distributed on a regular basis. The Middle East Journal The Journal was first published in 1947, making it the oldest U.S. peer-reviewed publication on the modern Middle East. In its early years, the Journal covered regional issues and history from the 19th and 20th centuries. In the 1980s, however, the Journal restricted its coverage to the post-World War II era. It now carries analyses of political, economic, and social developments as well as historical events in North Africa, the Middle East, the Caucasus, and Central Asia. Each issue features articles by a diverse array of scholars, book reviews, and a chronology of regional events organized by topic and country for each quarter. The fundamental policy of the Journal is to provide a forum that represents all views on issues facing the Middle East while maintaining a non-partisan stance. The current editor, Michael Collins Dunn, has been in this post since 1999. =Department of Languages= The Language Department's mission is to promote cultural understanding by offering evening and weekend language classes in Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, Turkish, Urdu, and Pashto. The classes are taught by experienced native as well as non-native instructors, many of whom also teach at nearby universities such as Georgetown and the University of Maryland. Students include those from government officials to university students to private-sector employees. =The Oman Library= The library, originally named after MEI's founder George Camp Keiser, was created at MEI's founding in 1946 and is housed in an old carriage house behind MEI's main building. Following a major contribution by Qaboos bin Said al Said, the Sultan of Oman, the library was renamed as the Oman Library and completed a renovation of its facilities in 2013. The library comprises the largest collection of literature on the Middle East in Washington, D.C., outside of the Library of Congress and holds materials in regional languages. It is estimated to house over 20,000 books and periodicals, all devoted to the region. The library is open to the public for in-house use. Centers of Study =Center for Pakistan Studies= Founded in April 2009, the Center for Pakistan Studies aims to foster closer relations and increased understanding between Pakistan and the United States. While Pakistan is not part of the \\"traditional\\" Middle East, it was included in MEI's original definition of the region due to its strong ties to Middle Eastern countries as well as its connection with the United States. The center's main focus is to create an online think tank of Pakistan experts where a unique online forum facilitates scholarly exchange between Pakistanis and Americans. This forum features a daily news feed as well as a collection of documents and publications from the U.S. government. The Center's two main concerns are Pakistani news as well as longer-term issues like water, energy, and the Kashmir conflict. Marvin Weinbaum is the current Director for the Center for Pakistan Studies. =Center for Turkish Studies= MEI established the Center for Turkish Studies in Summer 2009 to promote increased knowledge and understanding of Turkish politics, economics, and society. The distinctive feature of the Center for Turkish Studies is its analysis of Turkey within the context of its relationship with the Middle East. The Center for Turkish Studies aims to also enhance understanding and dialogue between the United States and Turkey through providing a channel of communication for academic and policy circles. The founding head of MEI's Center for Turkish studies is G√∂n√ºl Tol. =Sultan Qaboos Cultural Center (SQCC)= The Sultan Qaboos Cultural Center (SQCC) was established in 2005 following an agreement with the Sultanate of Oman. SQCC's establishment replaced the Sultan Qaboos bin Said Research Center for Middle East Studies, located at MEI since the mid-1980s. Kathleen Ridolfo, SQCC Executive Director, leads the center in its mission to educate Americans and Omanis about the breadth and richness of the two cultures. In 2011, SQCC opened a Cultural Center, which showcased Omani crafts and serves as a space for workshops and other events. In 2013, SQCC parted with MEI and relocated to new offices. =Middle East-Asia Project (MAP)= The Middle East-Asia Project (MAP) is an initiative to serve two broad objectives: * To promote awareness and understanding of the multidimensional relations between the Middle East and Asia by providing information and analysis on cross-regional economic, political, security, and social/cultural interactions and their implications; and * To foster collaborative research and other activities regarding Middle East-Asia relations through establishing an online community of experts and forging institutional partnerships. The Cyber Library contains publication details, abstracts, and live links to full- text versions of previously published works on Middle East-Asian affairs organized by country and by topic/issue. The Experts Directory contains the profiles and contact details of a worldwide network of academics, business leaders, diplomats, journalists, researchers and other practitioners affiliated with the MAP. The Infographics project element consists of periodically updated charts, tables, and timelines depicting key trends and developments in trade, investment, migration, and other spheres of cross- regional activity. The Publications element is organized as follows: Partner Content: refers to original works produced by MAP-affiliated experts for non- MEI outlets but made available to and posted to the MAP microsite in full-text format and later integrated into the Cyber Library. New MAP Publications: * Analysis: Short analytical essays (2,000 words) on key issues grouped under three main headings (i.e., politics/security, energy/commerce, and culture/society). * Dialogues: Brief commentaries by two or more contributors (every 500 words) on specific cross-regional developments or viewed from cross-regional perspectives. * Interviews: Online text-based conversations conducted with diplomats, businessmen or others drawing upon their own cross- cultural experiences, as well as insights and observations about the evolution of Middle East-Asian relations.

The campground traditionally played host to a majority of the Rhythm & Vines festival attendees. In the years leading up to 2014, a culture of excessive drinking and raucous behaviour, particularly on the final day of the festival, had been established at the campground. The campground's liberal B.Y.O. policy enabled festival attendees to load up on alcohol throughout New Year's Eve, prior to boarding buses to the nearby R&V; festival where B.Y.O. was not permitted. Unlike previous years, the 2014 BW campground did not allow campers to enter sections of the campground aside from that in which they were tenting. This enforced segregation of campers was disliked by many attendees, and early in the afternoon, as excitement began to build for the night ahead, a coordinated effort was made by a minority of campers to attempt to tear down the deer fencing which divided the campground. Security was quickly overwhelmed, and the successful flattening of the first fence sparked general dissent and disorderly behaviour throughout the entire campground. Over the next few hours chaos ensued, as tents and gazebos were systematically flattened and set on fire by punters. Several large bonfires were fuelled by tents and camping equipment. The event resulted in 63 arrests, 83 reported injuries, and seven hospital admissions. As attendees began boarding the buses to the nearby site of the RnV festival, the violence died away leaving a ruined campground. Tighter security at the site of the R&V; festival meant that the overflow of disorder between BW campground and the main event was minimal. 2014 was the final year that BW hosted Rhythm and Vines attendees en masse. Partly as a result of this event, summer music festivals with B.Y.O. alcohol licenses have become almost unheard of in New Zealand.

It is one of the world's largest songbirds, and is renowned for its elaborate tail and courtship displays, and its excellent mimicry. The species is endemic to Australia and is found in forest in the southeast of the country. According to David Attenborough, the superb lyrebird displays the most sophisticated voice skills within the animal kingdom‚Äî\\"the most elaborate, the most complex, and the most beautiful\\".  Taxonomy  The superb lyrebird was first illustrated and described scientifically as Menura superba by Major-General Thomas Davies on 4 November 1800 to the Linnean Society of London. Superb lyrebirds are passerine birds within the family Menuridae, being one of the two species of lyrebirds forming the genus Menura, with the other being the much rarer Albert's lyrebird. The superb lyrebird can be distinguished from Albert's lyrebird by its slightly larger size, less reddish colour and more ornate tail feathers. The generic name Menura derives from Ancient Greek mƒìnƒì 'moon' and oura 'tail', referring to the numerous transparent lunules in the inner webs of the outer tail- feathers (as described by John Latham in 1801). The specific epithet derives from Modern Latin Nova Hollandia 'New Holland', the name given by early Dutch explorers to Western Australia. Distribution and habitat Superb lyrebird in courtship display Lyrebirds are ancient Australian animals. The Australian Museum contains fossils of lyrebirds dating back to about 15 million years ago. The prehistoric Menura tyawanoides has been described from early Miocene fossils found at the famous Riversleigh site. The superb lyrebird is found in the forests of southeastern Australia, ranging from southern Victoria to southeastern Queensland. The bird was introduced to southern Tasmania in 1934‚Äì54, amid ill-founded fears the species was becoming threatened with extinction in its mainland populations. The Tasmania population is thriving and even growing. Across the rest of its large range, the lyrebird is common, and is evaluated as being of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This range of the superb lyrebird includes a variety of biomes, including subtropical and temperate rainforest, and wet and dry sclerophyll forest. The preferred habitat of the bird is in wet forest and rainforest, where there is an open ground layer of moist leaf litter shaded by vegetation. In favourable seasons, the lyrebird range is often extended into drier areas further from water sources. Description The superb lyrebird is a large, pheasant-sized terrestrial passerine, ranging in length from for the female to for the male. Females weigh around , and males weigh around . The plumage colour is mainly dark brown on the upper body, with greyish-brown underparts and red-tinged flight feathers. The wings are short and round, and are only capable of weak flight, being mainly used for balance or for gliding from trees to the ground. The legs are powerful, capable of running quickly, and the feet are strong enough to move branches up to 10 cm in diameter. Lyrebirds are renowned for their ornate tails. Adult males have tails up to long, consisting of sixteen feathers. The outer two feathers, the lyrates, are broad S-shaped feathers, originally named for their resemblance to the shape of a lyre, and have brown and buff coloured patterning. Between the lyrates are twelve filamentaries, feathers of flexible silvery barbs. In the centre of the tail are two silvery median feathers. The tail of the female is less ornate, with shorter lyrates and plain, broad feathers in place of the filamentaries. In both sexes, juveniles have no ornamental tail feathers. The tail plumage develops into that of the mature bird through a series of annual moults, with feathers undergoing change in structure and patterning. The male superb lyrebird reaches maturity in 7‚Äì9 years, and the female in 6‚Äì7 years. Behaviour and ecology Superb lyrebirds are ground-dwelling birds that typically live solitary lives. Adults usually live singly in territories, but young birds without territories may associate in small groups which can be single or mixed-sex. In Birds of the World (J. del Hoyo, A. Elliott, J. Sargatal, D. A. Christie, and E. de Juana, Editors). Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA. Lyrebirds are not strong fliers and are not highly mobile, often remaining within the same area for their entire lifespans. Superb lyrebird territories are generally small, and there are known behavioural differences between different populations. = Diet and foraging = The diet of the superb lyrebird consists primarily of invertebrates such as earthworms and insects found on the forest floor. There is also evidence that the birds are mycophagists, meaning that they eat fungi. Superb lyrebirds forage by scratching vigorously in the upper soil layers, disturbing the topsoil and leaf litter. The birds are most likely to forage in damp rainforest vegetation relative to drier areas, and in areas where the bottom vegetation strata is open and low in complexity, allowing good access to food sources in the leaf litter. =Mating and breeding= Superb lyrebirds exhibit polygyny, with a single male mating with several females. A male's territory can overlap with up to six female territories. Within his territory, the male will construct several circular mounds of bare dirt on the forest floor, for the purpose of conducting courtship displays. These mounds are defended vigorously from other males.Superb lyrebird in courtship display ‚Äî as seen from the backThere is strong sexual selection in lyrebirds, with females visiting the territories of several different males and choosing the most desirable males with which to copulate. When a male encounters a female lyrebird, he performs an elaborate courtship display on the nearest mound. This display incorporates both song and dance elements. The male fans out his tail horizontally to cover his entire body and head. The tail feathers are vibrated, and the lyrebird beats his wings against his body and struts around the mound. He also sings loudly, incorporating his own vocalisations with mimicry of other bird calls. A study has found evidence that the lyrebirds‚Äô ‚Äòdance choreography‚Äô is highly coordinated to different types of song repertoire. Coordination of movement with acoustic signals is a trait previously thought to be unique to humans, and indicates high cognitive ability. Females are the sole providers of parental care. They build large domed nests out of sticks on raised earth platforms. Nests are most likely to be located in wetter areas with deep leaf litter and high understory vegetation complexity, reflecting the requirements of food availability and protection from predators. The female breeds once per year in winter, usually laying a single egg. Eggs are laid in a deep bed of lyrebird feathers within the nest, and are then incubated by the female for up to 7 weeks. Post- fledging parental care lasts several months, with the female exerting significant energy in feeding and brooding the nestling. =Vocalisation and mimicry= Superb lyrebird sings in a suburban Sydney backyard, mimicking several Australian native bird calls. (3:30) The superb lyrebird is renowned for its mimicry, with an estimated 70-80% of the male's vocalisations consisting of imitations of other model bird species. Females also sing and are capable of mimicry, although not to the extent of the males. Mimetic items can be interspersed with lyrebird-specific songs, territorial calls, and alarm calls. The songs adhere to recognisable structures, with different elements repeated in certain patterns. The mimicry of the superb lyrebird is highly accurate, with even the model animal at times unable to distinguish between model song and mimicked song. For example, one study found that strike- thrushes did not respond any differently to hearing their own songs than to hearing imitations by lyrebirds. Generally, juveniles initially learn mimetic items through transmission by older lyrebirds, rather than from the model species themselves. This is reflected in the vocalisations of lyrebirds in the Sherbrooke Forest in Victoria, which were observed to frequently mimic the song of pilotbirds, a species that had not been recorded in the area for over 10 years. During the winter when the nestlings hatch, adults more frequently mimic model species that are less active during this time, again suggesting that mimetic items are initially learnt from other lyrebirds. The quality of mimetic song increases with age, with adult superb lyrebirds having both greater accuracy and a more diverse repertoire of mimetic songs when compared to subadult birds. Subadult lyrebirds produce recognisable imitations, which fall short of adult versions in terms of frequency range, consistency and acoustic purity, for example in imitations of the complex whipbird call. Like many passerine species, there are significant differences in lyrebird song in different populations over its geographic range. These include differences in repertoire and vocalisation characteristics, and may be due to differences in local bird species assemblages, which provide different options for model selection. It could also be due to differences in the acoustic environment mediated by vegetation structure, with lyrebirds more likely to mimic fragments of bird songs that are most acoustically prominent.  Mimicry as a sexually selected trait  The mimicry of male superb lyrebirds is a well- known example of a sexually selected trait. Females prefer males that produce more accurate mimicry and that have a greater diversity of mimetic songs in their repertoire. Although to the human ear the differences between songs are indistinguishable, there are differences in the mimetic song quality between individual lyrebirds due to signal degradation, reverberation and attenuation, as well as the frequency and volume attained. There is evidence that there are costs associated with the development of mimetic song, and while these costs are currently unknown, they indicate that that quality of a lyrebird's mimetic song is an honest signal that can be used by females in mate selection.  Mimicry in females  Historically, there has been far more research on the mimetic abilities of male lyrebirds. This is primarily due to the assumption that the evolution of song in passerines resulted primarily from the selection on males in attracting mates or deterring rivals. However, a study found that females also produced mimetic vocalisations while foraging and during nest defence, suggesting that mimicry has a function in deterring predators and conspecific rivals.  Mimicry of anthropogenic sounds  In David Attenborough's Life of Birds (ep. 6), the superb lyrebird is described as able to imitate twenty bird species' calls, and a male is shown mimicking a car alarm, chainsaw, and various camera shutters. However, two of the three lyrebirds featured were captive birds. One of the three was observed imitating a laughing kookaburra with such close similarity that a nearby kookaburra began responding to the lyrebird and calling back. A recording of a superb lyrebird mimicking sounds of an electronic shooting game, workmen, and chainsaws was added to the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia registry in 2013.National Film and Sound Archive: Sounds of Australia. The vocalizations of some superb lyrebirds in the New England area of New South Wales are said to possess a flute-like timbre. = Ecosystem engineers = The foraging behaviour of the superb lyrebird has a major effect on the structure of the forest floor. A lyrebird can move and bury up to 200 tonnes per hectare of leaf litter and soil every year, disturbing the soil to a greater extent than virtually any other animal. This soil disturbance hastens the decomposition of the leaf litter, and increases the rate of nutrient cycling in the ecosystem. The lyrebirds‚Äô clearing of bare patches also reduces the amount of fuel available for forest fires, which in turn reduces the extent and intensity of wildfires. = Threats and predators = Superb lyrebirds are vulnerable to native predatory birds such as the collared sparrowhawk, gray goshawk, and currawongs. Nests are particularly vulnerable to predation, but adults are also vulnerable due to their loud calls. It has been observed that males suffer higher degrees of mortality, suggesting that their courtship displays render them highly vulnerable. Methods utilised by superb lyrebirds to reduce predation risk include selection of protected areas for nest sites, mimicking calls of other predatory birds, and adopting solitary and timid behaviours. As the superb lyrebird is a poor flyer, when alarmed it will tend to run away, sometimes incorporating short gliding flights to lower perches or downhill. Human factors also pose threats to superb lyrebirds. Because they are ground-dwelling, superb lyrebirds are particularly threatened by vehicle collisions. The presence of roads and infrastructure also pose edge effects, for example disturbance from domestic animals and predation by introduced species such as the red fox, which is often associated with urban areas. In culture An instantly recognisable bird, the superb lyrebird has been featured as an emblem many times. Notable examples of this include a male superb lyrebird being featured on the reverse side of the Australian 10-cent coin, and as the emblem of the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service. = Museum specimens = John Gould's historic painting of a male and female pair of superb lyrebirds has the tail feathers of the male incorrectly displayed, with the lyrates in the centre of the plume surrounded by the filamentaries. This happened when a superb lyrebird specimen was prepared for display at the British Museum by a taxidermist who had never seen a live lyrebird, and Gould later painted his artwork from this incorrect presentation. A specimen of a male superb lyrebird, at the American Museum of Natural History, also has the tail feathers displayed incorrectly.

Plot Raymond Woods, a junior manager in a bank in the City, is becoming increasingly bored of his life as it takes a downhill tumble. First he finds out that he has missed the promotion opportunity at work by his bad tempered and disapproving boss, Strothers, and then he catches his wife a couple of days before Christmas having an affair with Strothers. (MISSING:) There is a plot detail left out here. Hugh Laurie character decides to get back at his bank boss by stealing money from the bank and get back at his wife by leaving her and living the high life in Rio. His character loves to watch latin dancing, hence another reason to go to Rio, where the dancer Orlinda is. Touching down in Rio, he calls a cab to take him to a nice hotel. The cab driver, Paulo, takes him to a fairly run down hotel. Raymond insists he needs a much nicer hotel with a beach, while Paulo insists Raymond would not be able to afford such a hotel, but suddenly changes heart once Raymond shows him a large wad of cash. Paulo immediately befriends Raymond, with his eyes greedily on his cash as he owes money to the biggest Mafia leader in Rio. He insists that he is prepared to take Raymond wherever he needs to go and whatever he needs done can be done. Therefore, Paulo takes Raymond to the nicest hotel in Rio. Raymond trips up in a commotion at the door of the hotel, dropping his bag and spreading his cash all over the floor. Once he hastily shuffles it all away, the hotel clerks immediately show him to the Presidential suite. After a day of shopping and generous spending Raymond reveals to Paulo he has come to Rio to look for the famous samba dancer Orlinda. Paulo then calls to tell Raymond he has found Orlinda. After dropping Raymond off at the club where Orlinda is performing, Paulo sneaks back to the hotel in an unsuccessful attempt to steal the money. Meanwhile, Raymond and Orlinda dance together, then Paulo drives them back to the hotel. Paulo tells Orlinda about the safe. Raymond enjoys a passionate night with Orlinda, but wakes to find the money gone. Raymond tries to find Orlinda, believing she has been kidnapped along with the money. Realising it is Christmas Eve, Paulo helps Raymond find Orlinda at midnight mass. She confesses to stealing his money, but tells him she doesn't have it, as she owed money to a Mafia leader, Bichero. On leaving mass, Raymond sees Bichero handing out cash, and runs after Bichero's car, but is captured. Bichero is about to have him executed, but instead locks him in a safe and forces him to count Bichero's money. On Christmas Day, Orlinda visits Raymond to give him a present. Raymond is still angry at the fact that she has ended him up in this situation. She tells him that she wished the money was only a small portion of what he owned and it wouldn't matter that she took it, and tells Raymond he's a \\"common crook\\". She tells Raymond not to give up hope. Raymond collects a large portion of the money and claims it is his. Orlinda then meets up with Paulo who takes his taxi and ties a rope to pull away at the bars of Raymond's prison. Raymond decides he should return the money to the bank, as he still has enough time to get back to England and return the money to the vaults without anybody noticing it had gone. He quickly buys a ticket back to London and hires a taxi driver to rush him back to the bank. However, when he arrives, the police are all over the building. About to rush in and explain to the police inspector, he discovers that over the Christmas period, somebody tunnelled into the vault and swiped the remainder of the money. Confused and relieved, Raymond leaves the bank, intending to return to Rio. Catching a taxi, when a couple leave, he recognises them as his wife and Strothers who have evidently just returned from their holiday in Tenerife. He tells his wife he'll leave her the address of where he's living in Rio to send the divorce papers, resigns from his job and goes back to Rio. He is next shown living with Orlinda and Paulo some years later with two babies and Bichero as his servant.

Vives was better known as a star of television soap operas at the time of its release. Songs such as \\"Aventurera\\" and \\"Te Extra√±are\\" on telenovelas would give Vives further mainstream exposure, as well as notable attention from the public. It is his final album to feature synthesizer-romantic ballads, and pop, predating his Cl√°sicos de la Provincia breakthrough in the vallenato genre.  Description  Before Carlos Vives was the \\"King of Vallenato\\" and one of Colombia's hottest musical exports, he was a struggling young star in Latin television. With soap operas, or telenovelas, being a springboard for Latin Americans seeking fame, Vives was no exception. In his home country of Colombia, the Santa Marta-born, and Bogot√° raised actor cut his teeth in a number of shows including \\"Peque√±os Gigantes\\" (Little Giants - 1983) and \\"Tuyo es Mi Coraz√≥n (Yours is My Heart - 1985) before finding notoriety in the title role of \\"Gallito Ram√≠rez (Ram√≠rez the Rooster - 1986). That same year, he released his first album Por Fuera y Por Dentro marking Vives's foray into his true passion, music. Despite Vives's newfound fame as an actor to coincide with his musical aspirations, his recordings were no match to fellow established crooners in the same genre. His debut and his second release No Podr√°s Escapar de M√≠, were lost in the shuffle in a market that included superstars such as Julio Iglesias and Juan Gabriel. Although his acting overshadowed any album recordings, Vives would continue, undaunted, with his subsequent release in the summer of 1989, a year that would see further fame and exposure in Carlos's rise to popularity. On June 6, 1989, \\"Al Centro de la Ciudad\\" (To Downtown), was released, coinciding with one of the busiest years in Vives's acting. Along with success in two starring roles, \\"La Conciencia de Luc√≠a\\" (The Conscience of Luc√≠a) and \\"L.P. ‚Äì Loca Pasi√≥n\\" (C.P. ‚Äì Crazy Passion), Vives would find fame in Puerto Rico, meeting his second wife (and mother to his two children) actress Hermelinda G√≥mez. Success outside Colombia would mark the first step Vives's burgeoning music career. Containing nine tracks, one of which \\"Me Estoy Muriendo de Amor\\" (I'm Dying of Love), was re-recorded from Por Fuera y Por Dentro; the album was mostly written by producer Pablo Manavello and Vives himself. The album differed little from Vives's prior releases, with a touch of rock influence. Like its predecessors, the songs are romantic ballads with a noticeable 80's production; drum machines, overdubbed guitars, and plenty of synthesizer. Starting with the opening track, \\"Aventurera\\" (The Adventurer), the song, which shares the same name from the Puerto Rican production Vives starred in, was given extensive play on both radio and television. Other notable songs include \\"Te Extra√±are (Missing You), and the Ricardo Montaner-penned \\"Casi Un Hechizo\\" (It was a Spell), which later became a salsa hit for Jerry Rivera . The album closes with an original Vives acoustic track \\"Cancion de Amor Eterno\\" (Song of Eternal Love), the only variation from the album's synth-sound. Though the album would contain no major hits, it would be his first international crossover record. What's more, Vives's acting career outside Colombia would pay off; the title track off of his No Podr√°s Escapar de M√≠ album would make a belated chart entry at #30 on the Billboard Hot Latin Charts, marking Vives's first hit single. Aside from early chart success, Al Centro de la Ciudad gave Vives his first recognition in music, the Coca-Cola sponsored Aires Awards. Fans of Vives's breakout success with La Provincia will find Carlos's earlier albums a complete departure from the dance-oriented vallento of later releases. In two years- time, Vives would reach the zenith of his acting career with Escalona, and would release his first vallenato-recordings with the show's accompanying soundtracks. Due to the breakthrough of Vives's Cl√°sicos de la Provincia, Sony re-released Al Centro de la Ciudad in 1997 (the only of Vives's first three albums to gain re-distribution), though it has now discontinued. However, Al Centro de la Ciudad along with the prior No Podr√°s Escapar de M√≠ are still available in compilations such as 20 De Colecci√≥n, which contain this entire album.

Intelligencer Journal  First printed in 1794 as the Lancaster Journal, the Intelligencer Journal was the largest circulation newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and the oldest continuously published newspaper in the United States of America that had not changed its name.  Lancaster New Era  The Lancaster New Era was founded in 1877 with the goal of taking the state Republican machine to task. In 1920, New Era merged with another Republican newspaper, The Examiner. Paul Block, Sr. bought the New Era-Examiner three years later and positioned it to compete with the morning Intelligencer and afternoon New Journal, both published by the Steinmans. When the venture failed in 1928, Block sold the paper, now named New Era, to the Steinmans, who merged the Intell and Journal into the morning Intelligencer Journal and published New Era as an afternoon newspaper on every day of the week except Sunday. The Saturday edition was eliminated in 2007 and associated content moved to the Saturday-morning edition of Intell. By 2009, New Era had the largest circulation of any Pennsylvania newspaper in the afternoon newspaper market. It won the Pennsylvania NewsMedia Association Sweepstakes Award four years in a row. Its reporting on the West Nickel Mines School shooting in eastern Lancaster County won numerous state and national awards, among them the Pulliam National Journalism Writing Award and the Taylor Award for Fairness from the Nieman Foundation for Journalism.

The group went by the names Army, Hocus Pocus, and White Heart before settling on just Heart in the mid-1970s. Ann Wilson joined the band in 1970 and Nancy in 1974; romances sprang up between the Fisher brothers and Wilson sisters, with Mike dating Ann and Roger dating Nancy. Heart rose to fame following the release of their debut album, Dreamboat Annie, in 1976. Follow-up albums Little Queen, Magazine, and Dog and Butterfly also sold well. Following the release of the Dog and Butterfly album, the Roger Fisher / Nancy Wilson romance came to an end. In October 1979, Fisher was dismissed from the group.

The novel was originally published in 1955, and won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction the following year. Plot summary The novel interweaves the stories of real and fictional characters. It is told from many points of view, including that of Henry Wirz, the camp commandant, who was later executed. It also features William Collins, a Union soldier and one of the leaders of the \\"Raiders\\". The \\"Raiders\\" are a gang of thugs, mainly bounty jumpers who steal from their fellow prisoners and lead comfortable lives while other prisoners die of starvation and disease. Other characters include numerous ordinary prisoners of war, the camp physician/doctor, a nearby plantation owner, guards and Confederate civilians in the area near the prison. Andersonville is clearly based on prisoner memoirs, most notably Andersonville: A Story of Rebel Military Prisons by John McElroy. Henry Wirz, who received an injury earlier in the war and never recovered properly, is portrayed not as an inhuman fiend but as a sick man struggling with a job beyond his capacities. Kantor's novel was not the basis for a 1996 John Frankenheimer film Andersonville. Although Kantor did sell the motion picture rights of his novel to one of the major Hollywood studios in the 1950s, it was never produced. Kantor's novel and the movie of the same name are two separate properties. Characters in Andersonville Historical figures who appear as characters in the novel include: * Henry Wirz (Confederate, camp commandant) * John McElroy (Union prisoner, future memoir writer) * William Collins (Union prisoner, \\"Raider\\" leader executed by fellow prisoners) * Boston Corbett (Union prisoner, future killer of John Wilkes Booth) * John Winder (Confederate general in charge of prisoners-of-war) * John L. Ransom (1843-1919) (Union prisoner), a printer from Jackson, Michigan, who kept a detailed diary of his capture, imprisonment, and escape. This was published as Andersonville Diary. * Robert Hall Chilton (Confederate Inspector General in Richmond who received reports from Field Surgeons, and consequently wondered, in print, about the judgment of history if the abominations at Andersonville remained uncorrected) References Bibliography Commager, Henry Steele. \\"The Last Full Measure of Devotion: A Novel of an Infamous Prison in the Civil War\\", The New York Times Book Review.

Retrieved 31 August 2015 is a flight member of an aircrew in the United States Air Force and is the mission commander in many multi-crew aircraft. The combat systems officer manages the mission and integrates systems and crew with the aircraft commander to collectively achieve and maintain situational awareness and mission effectiveness. CSOs are trained in piloting, navigation, the use of the electromagnetic spectrum, and are experts in weapon system employment on their specific airframe. Aircrew responsibilities include mission planning, mission timing, weapons targeting and employment, threat reactions, aircraft communications, and hazard avoidance. In 2006, USAF undergraduate CSOs began attending Initial Flight Training (IFT), a civilian contracted flight training operation under Air Education and Training Command (AETC) auspices, with their USAF undergraduate pilot counterparts at Pueblo Memorial Airport, Colorado, a program that replaced the previous Pilot Indoctrination Program (PIP) at USAFA, the previous Flight Instruction Program (FIP) in Air Force ROTC, the former Centralized Flight Screening Program for Air Force OTS graduates (and later USAFA and AFROTC graduates following discontinuation of PIP and FIP) at Hondo Municipal Airport, Texas, and the former Cessna T-41 Mescalero phase in Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) that was discontinued in the early 1970s. Initial Flight Screening (IFS) has continued as previously established at Pueblo with the transition of USAF Navs to CSOs. CSO training merges three previous USAF Undergraduate Navigator Training (UNT) tracks formerly known as the Navigator track, the Weapon Systems Officer (WSO) track and the Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) track into one coherent training cycle in order to produce an aeronautically rated officer who is more versatile and able to adapt to all spectrums of an airframe. Parallel Navigator and WSO training tracks ended in 2009. CSO implementation In 2009, most USAF navigators still in an operational flying status, or due to rotate back to an operational flying assignment, transitioned to CSO. Under Air Force Instruction 36-402, rated USAF navigators who do not transition to CSO are not eligible for advanced CSO ratings, e.g. senior CSO and master CSO. Those USAF officers currently on active duty or on the Reserve Active Status List in the Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard who were designated as USAF navigators prior to 30 Sep 1993, completed Undergraduate Navigator Training (UNT) and received their wings with the former 323d Flying Training Wing (323 FTW) at the former Mather AFB, California. With the BRAC-directed closure of Mather AFB, UNT was transferred to the 12th Flying Training Wing (12 FTW) at Randolph AFB, Texas in late 1993 and all USAF navigators except those destined for the B-1B and F-15E subsequently received their wings at that location. Concurrent with the move from Mather to Randolph, a parallel student USAF Navigators track was established for those officers desiring to become weapon systems officers (WSOs) in the B-1B and F-15E. These officer students proceeded to the U.S. Navy's Training Air Wing SIX at NAS Pensacola, Florida and followed a training track nearly identical to USN and USMC Student Naval Flight Officers destined for tactical jet aircraft.

AirForce.com. Retrieved August 9, 2018. Navigators trained via this track were also assigned to fly the E-4, the VC-25, and until its 2001 retirement, the VC-137. However, these latter three aircraft were not direct entry positions for recent flight school graduates and were/are crewed only by highly experienced navigators previously qualified in another aircraft. :* Navigators-cum-CSOs graduating from NAS Pensacola were assigned as weapon systems officers in the F-15E Strike Eagle strike fighter, the B-52 Stratofortress, or the B-1B Lancer bomber after follow-on EWO training at Randolph AFB. With the establishment of the 479 FTG and UCSOT, the integrated training program with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps at TRAWING 6 was discontinued. However, despite the divergence of USAF CSO training from student naval flight officer (NFO) training, all CSOs for all USAF aircraft model design series (MDS) now receive their training at NAS Pensacola. While some extant USAF MDS aircraft, such as the pure airlift variant of the C-130E are being retired, and the pure airlift version C-130J have eliminated the navigator/CSO position, all the other aforementioned extant MDS aircraft, as well as the HC-130J, MC-130J and WC-130J currently entering the inventory, continue to retain requirements for CSOs, thus ensuring the continued viability of the CSO career path. Until its inactivation and closure in September 1993 due to Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) action, all USAF undergraduate navigator training (UNT) took place with the former 323d Flying Training Wing at the former Mather AFB, California, utilizing the Boeing T-43A Bobcat and Cessna T-37 Tweet aircraft. In October 1993, training then shifted to the 12th Flying Training Wing at Randolph AFB, Texas, continuing at that location through 2009. Prior to its disestablishment at Randolph AFB, the 562d Flying Training Squadron of the 12th Flying Training Wing (12 FTW) was responsible for training inflight navigation with the Raytheon T-1A Jayhawk and Boeing T-43A Bobcat aircraft, while the 563d Flying Training Squadron taught electronic warfare in an academic and simulator environment. The 563d Flying Training Squadron also incorporated the T-43A Bobcat and the T-1A Jayhawk in advanced CSO training. The T-43A has since been retired and all T-1A CSO training aircraft transferred to the 479 FTG at NAS Pensacola. From 1994 until late 2009, a portion of USAF undergraduate navigator training took place at NAS Pensacola, integrated with the US Navy's student naval flight officer program under the aegis of Training Air Wing Six (TRAWING SIX) with USAF instructor navigators embedded in the wing and its squadrons. US Navy Training Squadron 4 (VT-4) and Training Squadron 10 (VT-10) conducted basic and intermediate flight training, initially the Raytheon T-34C Turbomentor until it was replaced by the T-6 Texan II, followed by training in the Raytheon T-1A Jayhawk and Rockwell T-39 Sabreliner. Training Squadron 86 (VT-86) then conducted advanced training in the T-39 and the Boeing T-45 Goshawk for student naval flight officers of the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps and numerous NATO/Allied and Coalition partner nations in addition to advanced USAF undergraduate navigator students destined for assignment as weapon systems officers in tactical aircraft. Prior to 2010, these USAF students destined for the F-15E Strike Eagle and the B-1B Lancer, as well as several USAF navigator flight instructors, were also fully integrated into these squadrons, with command of one squadron, VT-10, rotating between a USN commander who was a naval flight officer and a USAF lieutenant colonel who was a senior navigator or master navigator. Starting in the summer of 2010, following completion of initial flight screening, all US Air Force CSO students began attending training at NAS Pensacola as the training squadrons at Randolph AFB closed down in accordance with the 2005 BRAC Committee findings. CSO students now fall under the 479th Flying Training Group with two training squadrons (451 FTS and 455 FTS), one operations support squadron (479 OSS) and one student squadron (479 STUS). Like the previous navigator training squadrons at Randolph AFB, the 479 FTG and its subordinate squadrons also fall under the control of the 12th Flying Training Wing (12 FTW) at Randolph AFB, albeit as a geographically separated unit (GSU) of the 12 FTW. The first CSO class (11-01) under the new syllabus started 5 May 2010, and graduated on 15 April 2011. Upon completion of training, USAF CSOs receive basic CSO wings. At seven years of aeronautically rated service, they become eligible for the Senior CSO rating and at fifteen years the Master CSO rating, although an effort is underway to rename the Master CSO designation to Command CSO, standardizing same with their USAF Command Pilot counterparts. CSOs assigned to NASA manned spaceflight programs are also eligible for CSO-Astronaut insignia at the Senior and Master level based upon their aeronautical rating at the time and completion of at least one spaceflight. CSO operational command The rationale for the change in name from \\"Navigator\\" to \\"CSO\\" was based on the fact that USAF navigators, now known as CSOs, now serve as aircraft mission commanders and command operational combat flying squadrons, as well as operations groups and wings with an operational flying mission in the same manner as their USAF pilot counterparts.Kreisher, Otto. \\"Versatile, Ready, and Rated\\". AIR FORCE Magazine, August 2007 (Vol. 90, No. 8). Retrieved July 11, 2009. USAF navigators/combat systems officers at the general officer level have also begun serving in positions of increasing responsibility at the USAF major command (MAJCOM) and Unified Combatant Command level, up to and including commander of MAJCOMs and deputy commander of combatant commands. Although only one USAF navigator who did not subsequently retrain as a USAF pilot has achieved 4-star rank (pay grade O-10) in the entire history of the USAF, several have reached the 3-star (pay grade O-9) level. The most senior CSO currently on active duty is Lieutenant General Bradley A. Heithold, USAF, previously Deputy Commander of U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and previous Commander of Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC).

A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as a member of the Pittsburgh City Council from 2002 until 2014. Prior to being elected to City Council, Peduto attended Pennsylvania State University, from which he took a leave of absence before later completing his degree. He ran a consulting business and later served as Chief of Staff to his predecessor in City Council, Dan Cohen. Peduto was elected to City Council in 2001 and served from 2002 until 2014. During that time, he ran for Mayor of Pittsburgh three times. In 2005, he ran in the Democratic primary but was defeated by Bob O'Connor, who went on to become mayor in 2006. Peduto again ran in a 2007 special election following O'Connor's death; however, he dropped out before the primary. He ran for mayor for a third time in 2013, this time winning the Democratic nomination and emerging victorious. In the 2013 election, Peduto defeated opponents Joshua Wander and Lester Ludwig, winning 84% of the vote. After being elected Mayor to succeed Luke Ravenstahl, Peduto was inaugurated in January 2014. In the 2017 election, he was re-elected to a second term as Mayor, winning 96% of the vote in an election with no opposing candidates.2017 Pittsburgh mayoral election Education and early career Peduto was born on October 30, 1964, and graduated from Chartiers Valley High School in 1983. After one year at Carnegie Mellon University, Peduto transferred to Pennsylvania State University, pursuing a degree in political science while simultaneously becoming president of the University's chapter of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. He dropped out, however, before completing the degree requirements. In 2007, Peduto returned to finish his degree requirements and became the only member of the nine-member Pittsburgh City Council at the time to have a bachelor's degree. Later, he received a master's degree in public policy and management from the University of Pittsburgh. Peduto operated a political consulting business and served as general consultant, campaign manager, finance director and other roles for several Democratic candidates and elected officials. At 28, he served as a political director for then- acting Governor Mark Singel. He also worked in Washington, D.C. as an intern to then-U.S. Representative George Gekas. Prior to holding a seat on the city council, Peduto served as chief of staff to former City Councilman Dan Cohen. In 1996 Peduto was Cohen's campaign manager in a challenge to former U.S. Representative Bill Coyne in the Democratic primary. Peduto is reported to have urged Cohen to accuse Coyne of complacency when it came to obtaining federal funding and other resources for the Pittsburgh area. Cohen lost by a wide margin, which some pundits attributed to voter dislike of his negative advertising. Pittsburgh City Council Peduto speaks at the Art Institute of Pittsburgh, 2009. In the 2001 election, Bill Peduto ran for the Pittsburgh City Council District 8 seat being vacated by Dan Cohen, which represents the East End neighborhoods of Bloomfield, Friendship, Oakland, Point Breeze, Shadyside and Squirrel Hill. After being elected to a four-year term, he assumed office in January 2002. He was subsequently re-elected to two additional terms in 2005 and 2009. On the City Council, he chaired the Committee on General Services, Technology and the Arts. The Committee is in charge of all contracts and purchases as well as city owned buildings and land. Peduto also oversaw the City Information Systems department, the Cable Bureau and the Art Commission on Council. Peduto describes himself as a proponent of progressivism and as a \\"Reform Democrat.\\" He was named one of \\"100 New Democrats to Watch\\" by the Democratic Leadership Council in 2003 and one of National Journal's \\"PA Up and Comers\\" in 2004 and 2006. =Mayoral campaigns= Peduto launched his first campaign for Mayor of Pittsburgh in the 2005 mayoral election. He was defeated in the primary, however, by eventual general election winner Bob O'Connor. In 2006, following O'Connor's death, City Council President Luke Ravenstahl became Mayor. In his second bid for Mayor, Peduto mounted a primary challenge to Ravenstahl in the 2007 special election. Peduto ended his campaign before the primary, however, acknowledging Ravenstahl's relative popularity at the time. Peduto faced criticism for this decision from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette editorial board, which accused him of \\"political cowardice.\\" Peduto became a political opponent of Ravenstahl's, opposing Ravenstahl's proposal to end Act 47 oversight of Pittsburgh's finances among other issues. After being re-elected to City Council in 2009, Peduto decided that he would again challenge the incumbent mayor in the 2013 Democratic primary. Mayor of Pittsburgh In December 2012, Peduto officially launched his third mayoral campaign, announcing that he would challenge Luke Ravenstahl in the 2013 mayoral primary, and was immediately endorsed by Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald. He simultaneously announced that he would not seek re-election to a fourth term on City Council. Ravenstahl announced in March 2013 that he would not seek another term as Mayor. Several other candidates launched campaigns but after Ravenstahl's exit, the race evolved into a two-way race between Peduto and former Pennsylvania Auditor General Jack Wagner. In the May 21 primary, Peduto defeated his opponents, receiving 52% of the vote. Wagner, his closest challenger, received 40%. In November 2013, Peduto defeated Republican candidate Joshua Wander, who was residing in Israel at the time of the election, and independent candidate Lester Ludwig to be elected as the city's 60th mayor, receiving 84% of the vote. He was inaugurated on January 6, 2014. Peduto is an advocate for ride-sharing in Pittsburgh. After the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission issued cease-and-desist orders in July 2014, Peduto called on the state legislature to allow ride-sharing operators to legally operate in Pittsburgh. Subsequently, ride-sharing service Lyft acquired temporary approval for operation in August 2014 pending a hearing regarding a permanent license. In July 2014, Peduto and the City of Pittsburgh dropped a lawsuit that his predecessor, Luke Ravenstahl, had launched against UPMC, challenging its tax-exempt status. Peduto indicated his belief that the lawsuit impeded progress in ongoing negotiations between UPMC and the city regarding the payment of taxes. In early September 2014, Peduto announced the hiring of Cameron McLay as Pittsburgh Chief of Police, which resulted from an extended search following the resignation and subsequent conviction of Nate Harper on charges of tax evasion and slush fund conspiracy. Peduto appeared on the CBS television series Undercover Boss in December 2014 as \\"Ed Chadwick.\\" Following the premise of the show, Peduto disguised himself as a municipal worker to observe rank-and-file Pittsburgh employees. As is customary in the show, Peduto rewarded those whose performance was judged to be exemplary with monetary donations. These donations came from anonymous sources, since ethics laws bar the use of tax revenue. Common Cause Pennsylvania, a government watchdog group, called on the Peduto administration to disclose the donors shortly after the episode aired. In a statement produced on Twitter in the run up to the 2018 Primary Elections, Mayor Peduto announced his support for the legalization of marijuana for recreational purposes. In 2019, Peduto introduced multiple proposals to city council to restrict firearms access that were met with heavy resistance. The bills were eventually passed by the city council after months of heated debate https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711401894/pittsburgh-restricts-use-of-assault- style-weapons-setting-up-court-fight The bills were met with heavy resistance with lawsuits being threatened, until the city decided to not enforce the laws they passed. On August 18th, 2020, Pittsburgh residents protesting police brutality demonstrated outside Peduto's home, staying there until 10am the next day,https://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/photos-protesters-camp- outside-pittsburgh-mayor-pedutos-house-overnight/Content?oid=17844099 when police officers declared the assembly unlawful. Later on the 19th, Peduto released a statement criticizing the protests, saying that any demonstration in his residential area \\"crosses a line that cannot be allowed to continue\\".https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases.html?id=4241 The Mayor's office later announced via Twitterhttps://twitter.com/TheNextPGH/status/1296234408060620802 that Peduto would be at his home that evening to speak to protestors. After an unproductive conversation, Pittsburgh Police again declared an unlawful assembly, and after giving unclear dispersal orders, marched the protestors into nearby Mellon Park and ordered protestors to enter. Police then incorrectly stated that the park was closedhttps://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/police-escalate-protest-outside- pedutos-house-with-tear-gas-projectiles-and-apparent- kettling/Content?oid=17850358 and began to fire tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets at the crowd. These actions were quickly condemned by a local law professor,https://twitter.com/JerrySDickinson/status/1296299120274145285?s=20 but as of yet there has been no official condemnation of this unlawful kettling incident from the Mayor's office. =2017 re-election campaign= Peduto announced on December 14, 2016, that he was running for a second term as Mayor of Pittsburgh in the 2017 election. He faced two challengers in the May 2017 primary: John Welch, a progressive minister who challenged Peduto from the left, and city councilwoman Darlene Harris, a longtime foe, who had not filed an official campaign organization. He defeated both challengers in the primary to win the Democratic nomination, and did not face any Republican candidate in the general election, as none filed to run in the primary. Peduto was re-elected with approximately 96% of the ballots cast on November 7, 2017.

It is eaten plain or is often used as an ingredient in salads, soups, and other dishes. Definition Farro is an ethnobotanical term for three species of hulled wheat: spelt (Triticum spelta), emmer (Triticum dicoccum), and einkorn (Triticum monococcum). Hulled wheat is wheat that cannot be threshed.Szab√≥, A. T., and K. Hammer. \\"Notes on the Taxonomy of Farro: Triticum monococcum, T. dicoccum, and T. spelta\\". Padulosi, S., K. Hammer and J.

In Italian cuisine, the three species are sometimes distinguished as farro grande, farro medio, and farro piccolo. In French the three species are sometimes distinguished as grand √©peautre, moyen √©peautre and petit √©peautre ‚Äî √©peautre being French for spelt. Emmer is by far the most common variety of farro grown in Italy, specifically in certain mountain regions of Tuscany and Abruzzo. It is also considered higher quality for cooking than the other two grains and thus is sometimes called \\"true\\" farro. Spelt is much more commonly grown in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Confusion about the terminology for these three wheat varieties is generated by the difficult history in the taxonomy of wheat and by colloquial and regional uses of the term farro. For example, emmer grown in the Garfagnana region of Tuscany will be colloquially simply known as farro. Also, some English speakers assume farro refers to steamed or boiled grain presented as salad and similar dishes rather than to the three grains themselves. Farro is also sometimes referred to inaccurately as \\"spelt\\" in English, neglecting the fact that the term refers to all three grains ‚Äì emmer, einkorn and spelt. Print. Etymology The Italian word farro derives from the presumed Latin word farrum, from Standard Latin far, farris n. : a kind of wheat (as in farina (food)). Far, in turn, derives from the Indo-European root *b ∞ar-es- : (spelt), which also gave rise to the English word barley, Albanian bar : grass, Old Church Slavonic –±—Ä–∞—à—å–Ω–æ (bra≈°ƒ≠no) : flour, and Greek Œ¶ŒÆœÅŒøŒΩ (ph·∏óron): plant deity.

It takes its name from a relic of the True Cross or Holy Rood. History A supposed fragment of the True Cross was brought to Ireland by the Plantagenet Queen Isabella of Angoul√™me,Holy Cross Abbey from The Catholic Encyclopedia, Volume VII. Published 1910. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Nihil Obstat, June 1, 1910. Remy Lafort, S.T.D., Censor around 1233. She was the widow of King John and bestowed the relic on the original Cistercian Monastery in Thurles founded in 1169 by King Donald O'Brien of Thomond, which she then rebuilt. With time, Holy Cross Abbey and the sacred relic of the True Cross became a place of medieval pilgrimage, and with the Protestant Reformation, also a rallying- point for the dispossessed and victims of religious persecution. As a symbol and inspiration for the defence of the Catholic faith, resistance and the struggle for freedom, it drew a complaint by Sir Henry Sidney, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, to Queen Elizabeth I in 1567. The Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland recount that in 1601, Prince Hugh Roe O'Donnell, on his way to the Battle of Kinsale, true to his family arms and Constantinian motto (In Hoc Signo Vinces) and in anticipation of the battle to come at Kinsale, visited and venerated a relic of the True Cross on the Feast of St. Andrew, on November 30, 1601, at Holy Cross Abbey. At that period it was a rallying point for the defence of religious freedom and for Irish sovereignty. From there he sent an expedition to Ardfert, to win a quick victory and successfully recover the territory of his ally, Fitzmaurice, Lord of Kerry, who had lost it and his 9-year-old son to Sir Charles Wilmot.

Local people used the roofless ruins as a burial place after 1740. It became a scheduled national monument in 1880, \\"to be preserved and not used as a place of worship\\". Special legislation in the D√°il on its 500th anniversary, 21 January 1969, enabled Holy Cross Abbey to be restored as a place of Catholic worship, exceptionally for a national monument. The Sacristan of St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican provided an authenticated relic of the Holy Cross, and the emblem of the Jerusalem Cross, or Crusader Cross, has been restored for the Abbey.Holy Cross Abbey, by Thomas Morris, Irish Heritage Series, no. 55, published by Eason & Son Ltd, Dublin 1986. Two crosses were stolen, including the cross containing the relics of the true cross, in a raid on the Abbey on 11 October 2011. A portable angle grinder, hammer and screwdriver were used by the masked raiders to remove the relics. In January 2012, the relics of the true cross were reported to have been retrieved.

Civil rights activities Mars was one of the few whites in Neshoba County, Mississippi who supported the Civil Rights Movement. She helped to register black voters. Mars lived in Philadelphia, Mississippi when three civil rights activists James Chaney, Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman were beaten and shot by members of the Ku Klux Klan near Philadelphia. She was one of the few inhabitants to co-operate with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Edgar Ray Killen and others faced trial for violating the civil rights of the men in 1967 but the jury was deadlocked. Seven men were convicted in relation to the incident but no-one served more than six years. This incident was later the subject of the film Mississippi Burning, which was released in 1988. Frances McDormand's character was partly based on Mars. Mars' activities led to the Ku Klux Klan burning down her barn in an effort to intimidate her. Witness in Philadelphia In 1977, she published Witness in Philadelphia: a Mississippi WASP's Account of Civil Rights Murders which told of her activities in the civil rights movement and the murder of the three activists. This book helped to keep interest alive in the murders with the success of Mississippi Burning making many more people aware of the incident. As a result of this incident, Killen was sentenced to sixty years in jail on June 1, 2005. Death Mars died in Philadelphia, Mississippi, aged 83, of Bell's palsy and diabetes from which she had been suffering. References * Witness in Philadelphia by Florence Mars.

It is known for as a center of prayer and monastic work. Jams and beer produced by the monks are particularly popular. The monastery is also known as one of the origins of the centering prayer movement in the 1970s. Certain parts of the abbey are generally open to the public.  History  St. Joseph‚Äôs Abbey was founded in 1950 on the former site of Alta Crest Farms, under the leadership of Dom Edmund Futterer. The monks moved there from their previous location in Cumberland, Rhode Island, which was heavily damaged by a 1950 fire. Father Thomas Keating was elected abbot of the abbey in 1961. Keating, a leader in the contemplative prayer movement, retired in 1981. Keating, William Meninger, and Basil Pennington held retreats at the abbey to teach this method of prayer. After the short term of Dom Pascal Skutecky, Dom Augustine Roberts became the fourth Abbot in June 1984 and served two six-year terms.Roberts' autobiography is entitled Finding The Treasure: Letters From A Global Monk. The current Abbot, Damian Carr, was elected in June 1996.  Goods produced  = Trappist Preserves = Trappist Preserves is a brand of fruit preserves produced and sold by the abbey. In 1954, shortly after their arrival in Spencer, a small, stove-top batch of mint jelly was made by Brother John Berchmans, one of the monks, with mint from their herb garden. Since monastic austerity at that time precluded the jelly from being served to the monks at meals, it was sold at the porters' lodge. The response to the jelly encouraged the monks to try making and selling other varieties. Soon, jelly-making proved to be a successful and compatible monastic industry, contributing about half of the income needed to run the abbey. The jams and jellies made by the monks are sold in supermarkets in the United States, particularly in the New England region. In 2005, the monks produced 1.7 million jars of preserves in 26 flavors, turning one and a half tons of fruit into preserves daily. = Spencer Brewery = Spencer Brewery is the name of the brewery run by the abbey that produces Trappist beer. In 2010, St. Joseph's Abbey explored possibility of brewing beer like other Trappist monasteries, and sent several fact finding missions ‚Äî first to the Belgian Beer Fest in Boston, then to several Trappist breweries in Europe. The Trappist breweries made three recommendations for the new enterprise: hire a skilled brewing engineer; build a modern, state of the art facility; and only brew a single beer for the first five years. Over twenty test batches were developed before settling on the final beer's recipe. The first beer produced was a blonde ale at 6.5% alcohol by volume which was called Spencer Trappist Ale. , it was the first and only certified Trappist beer brewed in the United States. The brewery occupies 36,000 square feet and has a capacity of 50 barrels. It held its first open house on August 6, 2016 to 2,500 visitors. Response from subsequent open houses was strong, and as of 2018 the brewery was exploring constructing a taproom that would be open year-round. = The Holy Rood Guild = The monks at the abbey also make liturgical vestments under the brand of The Holy Rood Guild.

Name There are two versions of stories of how Jementah got its name. The first version was during the foundation of a village which later became Jementah town center, some villagers complained, \\"Jemu, jemu, jemu! Asyik-asyik menebas lalang saja!\\" which literally meant that they felt bored for only cutting long grasses, and the others replied, \\"Entah, entah, entah!\\" (I don't know, I don't know, I don't know!). From the Malay words jemu and entah, local residents believed that the combination of those words formed the word Jementah. Another version stated that the villagers were bored and tired of removing leeches which sucked their blood when they were working, and therefore the combination of the words jemu and lintah which means leech in Malay formed the word Jementah.

The game draws a heavy influence from Don Bluth's Dragon's Lair games and features Bay Area actors Dale Morris, Fred Smith, Michael Ronin Orlando, Eric Carlson, Kaliopi Eleni, Jett, Pamela Herron and Jody Mortara among the fifty plus roles, as well as voice-overs by comedian Rob Schneider. Because of the large number of video sequences, the game was originally released on 5 CDs.  Plot and gameplay  The protagonist finds himself in the land of Eseveron. The player must click on certain icons at specific times to proceed, all in an effort to figure out what is happening and how to escape. Reception PC Gamer US called A Fork in the Tale \\"a dismal flop, uniformly panned by critics and avoided by gamers, who bought less than 1,000 copies.\\" A Next Generation critic complained about the small amount of interactivity and said Rob Schneider's vocal delivery is mediocre. Charles Ardai of Computer Gaming World also criticized the limited interactivity and Schneider's performance, but focused most of his commentary on the repetitiveness of the video clips. He summarized, \\"At its best, it's reasonably funny; at its worst, the comedy is abysmal. But since the gameplay involves going through the same FMV scenes over and over and over, even the best comedy in the world couldn't stave off a creeping sense that you have been damned to some sort of Sisyphean penance.\\" Game Revolution thought the game was short and easy, yet fun. In contrast, Rebecca Anderson of GameSpot considered the plot interesting but the gameplay frustratingly difficult, saying that the game demands the player to make decisions on a split second's notice, and sends the player back too far after failures.

Written by Phil Klemmer and directed by Jason Bloom, the episode premiered on UPN on April 18, 2006. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica investigates the car that ran over a student's (Tommy Snider) dog, and it turns out that the case is connected to the bus crash mystery. Meanwhile, Wallace (Percy Daggs III) and Jackie (Tessa Thompson) start a relationship.  Synopsis  Veronica is interrogated about the Aaron Echolls sex tapes. Mac (Tina Majorino) tells Veronica that her cell phone interceptor has been confiscated for the year and that she was using it to spy on Beaver (Kyle Gallner). Butters asks Veronica to get Mac as his prom date. However, Veronica uses Butters to get her and Mac into Principal Clemmons's office. Veronica finds the cell phone interceptor as well as a copy of The Anarchist Cookbook from Weevil's (Francis Capra) locker. Veronica accuses Weevil of blowing up the bus. A student approaches Veronica and asks her to track down the car that ran over his dog. Veronica finds no cars of the type in Neptune. Jackie asks Veronica to help her get a job at Java the Hut. The manager gives Jackie the job. Veronica tells Keith about Logan and Kendall's relationship, and Keith tells Veronica to find out whether they were together at the time of the crash. The car that Veronica is looking for passed by Gia on their way to the cliff. Gia thinks that it was probably some college kids. Wallace makes a failed attempt to reunite with Jackie. Hector tells Weevil that the Fitzpatricks are mistreating the former PCHers. Keith shows Veronica Kendall's high school yearbook and proves that Kendall was stealing her identity to escape criminal charges. Veronica meets a blind woman to whom the car belongs. Veronica sneaks into the garage and finds the remains of a Fitzpatricks sticker and several guns inside. Weevil talks to Veronica about the PCHers's mistreatment and believes that Thumper and his number board are involved. Veronica agrees to help. Wallace meets Jackie at Java the Hut, where she says she has a crush on him, but also says that she has been accepted to the Pantheon-Sorbonne University, meaning that they will not have a long relationship. Veronica tracks the car and notices some criminal activity. She calls Keith for help, but he hangs up when Liam Fitzpatrick breaks into Kendall's apartment, where he is. Liam threatens Keith before Keith fights back. Veronica and Keith successfully escape, with Keith swiping Kendall's hard drive. The Fitzpatricks torture one drug dealer, before Weevil successfully threatens the Fitzpatricks with a list of their well-to-do clients. However, Weevil drives off and says that the PCHers are on their own. Veronica finds out that the owner of the car is Liam's grandmother. Eventually, Veronica and Keith deduce that Kendall could have caused the crash. Wallace and Jackie agree to start a relationship, and some new \\"evidence\\" surfaces in the Kane case, including some of Duncan's hair. Veronica finds out that Liam ran over Harry's dog, but Harry's brother tells her not to tell him so that he won't kill Liam. Veronica tells Harry that she didn't find the culprit.  Cultural references  The following cultural references are made in the episode: *Veronica says that she watches Animal Planet. *Veronica mentions James Bond. *Weevil has The Anarchist Cookbook in his locker. *Veronica jokingly tells Keith that he was probably watching South Beach. *Veronica mentions Nash Bridges in relation to the Barracuda. *Veronica references Dick Cheney. *Veronica compares Keith to Rick Springfield. *The elderly woman to whom the Barracuda belongs mentions Vanna White, Pat Sajak, and Wheel of Fortune. *Veronica jokingly tells Weevil that he has Maybelline eyelashes. *The episode references Heidi Fleiss.  Arc significance  The Fitzpatricks are in league with Kendall, and Kendall has actually stolen her identity from a girl who died in a car crash. Logan confirms that Kendall was by herself at the time of the bus crash. Thumper's wooden paddle had carvings of the license plate numbers of customers that he had been servicing. In addition, the Lilly Kane plot line resurfaces‚ÄîAaron's Oscar statue has been discovered in the backyard of the Kanes with some of Duncan's hair on it.

Leaves should be dried soon after they get wet to prevent leaf spot fungi. Every 10 days plants should get organic fertilizer over the leaves in a solution of up to 600 yS. Occasionally, fish emulsion or sea weed fertilizer (Bioalgen S90) or an amino acid fertilizer is applied. Other genera that grow well on such stones is the closely related Schlimia and also some terrestrial Polycycnis like P. morganii. T. chloris flowers are extremely fragrant and do not require pollinators. they are only open for one day. Concerning sandwich mounts it should be mentioned that Coryanthes were found to grow even better on sandwich mounts without bark, only Styrofoam (make sure by calling the producer its free of Freon or similar toxic substances added to prevent fire in some kinds of styrofoam), some large pieces of broken clay pots and a bit of fiber peat fixed together with a cord made of synthetic material.

Due to the deprivation of education during war time, the education given was free and the number of students was enormous. For Jit Sin branch campus there were over 1000 students. At the end of year 1945, the schools went back to their original modes. Jit Sin Primary School was officially reopened in 1946. In 1948, the main campus in Market Street was demolished under municipal regulation. Although there were other campuses and schools, there were not capable to accommodating the significantly increasing number of students. New campus was decided to be at a piece of land of Mr Huang Jiu JiÔºàÈªÑ‰πùÂêâÔºâ in Aston Road, Bukit Mertajam, which is nearby the original location (now Jit Sin Independent High School).

He was a member of the Republican Party. Early life John Ten Eyck was born in Freehold Township, New Jersey, and was the son of William Ten Eyck (1783-1837) and Leah (Conover) Ten Eyck (1787-1832). The Dutch American Ten Eyck family (pronounced \\"Ten Ike\\") was long prominent in law, business and politics, particularly in New York and New Jersey. John C. Ten Eyck completed preparatory studies under private tutors, studied law with Joseph Fitz Randolph, and was admitted to the bar in 1835. Ten Eyck established a successful law practice in Burlington, New Jersey, first in partnership with Garret D. Wall, and later as the sole member of his own firm. Originally a Whig, he was prosecuting attorney of Burlington County from 1839 to 1849, and was a delegate to the New Jersey constitutional convention of 1844. Ten Eyck joined the Republican Party at its founding in the 1850s, and was a supporter of John C. Fr√©mont in the 1856 presidential election.. U.S. Senator Ten Eyck served in the U.S. Senate from March 4, 1859 to March 3, 1865, after winning election in a joint session of the New Jersey State Legislature which met in January 1859. The anti-slavery Opposition Party, which consisted of members of the new Republican Party, traditional Whigs, members of the Free Soil Party, and members of the American Party vied with Democrats for control of the legislature and selection of a U.S. senator. With none of the Opposition groups strong enough to elect a candidate on their own, but determined to prevent the re-election of William Wright or the election of another Democrat, the Opposition eventually decided to agree on a compromise candidate who had no strong ties to any faction. They selected Ten Eyck, who was not an active candidate, but was known to have been a Whig, and more recently a Republican, yet not politically prominent in recent years or strongly committed to any Opposition faction. Members of the American Party were especially unhappy at being unable to elect John F. Randolph or another American candidate, but accepted Ten Eyck to ensure that a Democrat would not win the seat. During his Senate career, which spanned the American Civil War, Ten Eyck served on the Judiciary and Commerce committees. He entered the Senate as a presumed moderate, and opposed allowing slavery to expand, but believed the Constitution permitted it where it existed. He also supported enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 even though he was personally opposed to it, on the grounds that he believed it was constitutional. Over time, his anti-slavery views became more pronounced. When the New Jersey State Legislature passed early 1861 resolutions in support of the Crittenden Compromise, Ten Eyck complied with the legislature's instructions to transmit them to the Senate, but made clear that he believed they were unconstitutional. Ten Eyck voted to end slavery in Washington, D.C., and voted in favor of the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery in the United States. When soldiers of the Confederate States Army invaded Pennsylvania in the summer of 1863, Ten Eyck advocated immediate creation of a Burlington County militia unit to take part in Pennsylvania's defense. He enlisted as a private in order to set an example for those in attendance, and they called the unit they created the \\"Ten Eyck Guards\\" in his honor. He marched to Pennsylvania with the company, and once the Confederates had retreated, he completed his term of service upon the return of the Ten Eyck Guards to Burlington County. Post-Senate career After leaving the Senate, Ten Eyck resumed practicing law. He was a delegate to the 1866 National Union Convention, which attempted unsuccessfully to promote post-Civil War reconciliation, including unity behind the Reconstruction policies of President Andrew Johnson. In 1873, he was appointed to the commission that revised the Constitution of New Jersey, and served as its president following the death his predecessor. The commission submitted its proposed changes to the state legislature, who presented to them voters for ratification. The changes were approved in an 1875 election, and went into effect soon afterwards. Death and burial Ten Eyck died at his home in Mount Holly Township, New Jersey on August 24, 1879. and was interred in Mount Holly's St. Andrew's Cemetery. Family On June 10, 1845, Ten Eyck married Julia Gadsby (1818-1890), the daughter of John Gadsby and Providence (Norris) Gadsby. They were the parents of six children -- Augusta (1846-1876), Julia (1847-1941), Jane (1849-1918), May (1850-1951), Virginia, and John (1855-1935). References Sources  Guide to the John C.

It is actually a barrier as it reaches landfall on either side (at Banks Peninsula/Birdlings Flat and Taumutu), though at its western end it tapers to a point less than 100 metres in width which is occasionally breached at high tide. The spit is noted for its isolation and for its pebbly beaches. The barrier is low-lying but is not prone to flooding. A gravel road extends along half of its length from the small settlement of Birdling's Flat at its easternmost point. At this point, the northern shore of the spit is washed by a tidal lagoon, Kaituna Lagoon, which is essentially a short broad arm of Lake Ellesmere.

He is alleged to be a member of the pro-Iran Saudi Hizballah, or Hizballah Al-Hijaz, meaning Party of God, being led by Al-Mughassil. The group is one of a number of related Hezbollah organizations operating in Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Kuwait and Bahrain, among other places, and was outlawed in Saudi Arabia. Khobar Towers plot, 1993‚Äì1996 The 2001 indictment traces the carefully organized 1996 bomb plot back to on or about 1993 when El-Hoorie was part of a team instructed by Al Mughassil to begin surveillance of Americans in Saudi Arabia, including at the location of Khobar Towers as early as 1994. In early 1996, Al-Hoorie was part of the small team that began to hide explosives around the Khobar area. In early June 1996, a tanker truck was purchased by the conspirators, and the indictment names El-Hoorie as one of the men who then spent two weeks converting the truck into a truck bomb. The cell finalized plans on the evening of June 25, 1996, for the attack that night. When the Datsun signaled that all was clear by blinking its lights, the bomb truck, driven by Al-Mughassil and with El-Hoorie as a passenger, entered the lot and backed up against a fence in front of building # 131. Al-Mughassil and Al-Hoorie then exited the truck and entered the back seat of the Caprice for the getaway, driving away followed by the Datsun. In minutes, a massive explosion sheared the north face off Building 131. 19 American servicemen were killed, and 372 were wounded. Although rooftop sentries were immediately suspicious of the truck ‚Äì parked some 25 m (80 ft) from the building ‚Äì and attempted an evacuation, few escaped. Comparable to 9,000 kg (20,000 lb) of TNT, the bomb was estimated to be larger than the one that destroyed the federal building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, a year before, and more than twice as powerful as the 1983 bomb used at the Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon. Immediately following the terrorist attack, the leaders fled the Khobar area and Saudi Arabia using fake passports.

He was framed with charges of factionalism by the power elite that opposed his reform measures and was sentenced to drink poison in the Third Literati Purge of 1519. He has been widely venerated as a Confucian martyr and an embodiment of \\"seonbi spirit\\" by later generations in Korea. Some historians consider him one of the most influential figures in 16th century Korea. He is known as one of the 18 Sages of Korea () and honored as Munmyo Baehyang ().Joseon Annals, September 15, 1604. No. 4  Life  =Early years= Jo Gwangjo Jo Gwangjo was the son of Jo Wongang (Ï°∞ÏõêÍ∞ï, Ë∂ôÂÖÉÁ∂±) and was from the Hanyang Jo clan (ÌïúÏñëÏ°∞Ïî®, Êº¢ÈôΩË∂ôÊ∞è). Jo studied under neo-Confucian scholar Kim Gwoeng-pil, Kim Jong-jik's disciple who was in exile at the time following the First Literati Purge of 1498. When Kim Gwoeng-pil was later executed (by poison) following the Second Literati Purge of 1504, Jo was exiled for being Kim's disciple. At this time, Joseon Dynasty politics was primarily marked by power struggle between two aristocratic yangban factions - the established \\"Hungu\\" power elites who were generally conservative and the upstart Sarim scholars called seonbis, who belonged to neo-Confucian school of Kim Jong-jik and other thinkers. Sarim faction had entered the court politics during the reign of King Seongjong but suffered two bloody purges under his successor Yeonsangun. When Yeonsangun was eventually deposed in 1506, Jungjong was placed on the throne as the eleventh king of Joseon by the Hungu leaders who led the coup. For first ten years of his reign, Jungjong could not truly rule the country with regal authority (he was forced to depose his faithful queen because her father was killed by the coup leaders, and they feared that the queen might take revenge.) However, three main coup leaders died of natural causes by then, and Jungjong began to welcome Sarim scholars to his court to check Hungu faction's power. The Sarim faction considered Hungu faction as a whole as greedy and corrupt men unworthy of respect and sought to establish ideal neo-Confucian society. (Indeed, many of coup leaders had enjoyed Yeonsangun's favor during most of his reign, and their chief Park Won-jong led the coup mainly for personal revenge for his sister was raped by Yeonsangun.) Jo Gwangjo came from a prominent family that belonged to Hungu faction but was called \\"crazy man\\" and \\"source of disaster\\" by people around him for studying neo-Confucianism under exiled Sarim scholar Kim Gwoeng-pil at the height of persecution of the Sarim faction. In 1510, Jo Gwangjo passed the Gwageo exam and became a student at Royal Academy called Seonggyungwan. He was often recommended for a court position by high officials and fellow students at Seonggyngwan, but he delayed entering civil service to pursue further study until 1515, when he was recommended to King Jungjong by Minister of Personnel Ahn Dang and 200 Seonggyungwan students and was immediately appointed to a position of junior sixth rank. However, he was ashamed to take office with others' help and took Al-seung-si exam, and his essay caught Jungjong's attention. By then, Jo was already known for unbending and outspoken character as he soon emerged as the leader of Sarim faction. For instance, when he became a jung-un, lowest position at Office of Censors, the first thing he did on the following day was to petition the king to fire all his superiors at the Office of Censors and Office of Inspector General. At the time, two Sarim officials had petitioned the king to restore status of the deposed queen, who was deposed by Hungu faction. Office of Inspector General and Office of Censors had them exiled for their impertinent petition. Jo Gwangjo argued that two offices violated their given function by suppressing free speech and petitioned the king to fire his superiors or accept his resignation since he could not work with them. To the surprise of everyone, Jungjong replaced everyone in two offices except Jo. This event reflected Jungjong's complete trust and confidence in Jo, who rose in a series of unprecedented promotions from rank of junior sixth rank to junior second rank in only three years. =Jo Gwangjo's reforms= Jo Gwangjo King Jungjong wanted to bring new talents to the royal court that was dominated by Hungu faction, and Jo complied by introducing a new system of government recruitment via recommendations that were based on the candidates' moral character as well as scholarship. He argued that existing officer examination were too philosophical and placed too much emphasis on literary skills, detached from the practical needs of the government. The supplementary examination that Jo introduced was called an \\"examination for the learned and the virtuous\\" (hyeollanggwa). This was an abbreviated examination for candidates recommended by local magistrates as men of highest integrity in the presence of the king, who chose the winning candidates. This system allowed Jo to recruit many talented Sarim scholars who had been living secluded life in rural provinces. However, it also left him open to Hungu faction's attack that Jo formed a clique of his supporters by placing them in key positions. Jo and his supporters then pushed forth a series of radical reforms as they established local self-government system called Hyang'yak to strengthen local autonomy and communal spirit among people. In this system, deference was placed according to senority of villagers rather than their social status. The Sarim faction also sought to reduce gap between the rich and poor with a land reform that would distribute land to farmers equally and limit amount of land and number of slaves that one could own. This measure also targeted Hungu faction's accumulation of land and wealth.KBS World, January 23, 2010, \\"Jo Gwangjo, Reformer who dreamt ideal neo-Confucianism\\" Deeply influenced by Zhu Xi's neo- Confucianism, Jo Gwangjo believed that ideal world of mythical Chinese Emperor Yao and Shun, could be achieved if all people from the king down to low-born became morally refined and followed Confucius' teachings. The Sarim faction therefore promulgated Confucian writings among the populace by translating them in Korean hangul and distributing them widely. They also suppressed Buddhism and Taoism as superstitious religions by destroying the royal Taoist temple and confiscating properties of Buddhist temples. As Inspector General, he impeached many officials for corruption and bribery. According to Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, it was said that no official dared to receive a bribe or exploit the populace during this time because of such strict enforcement.Annals of Joseon Dynasty, October, 1520 He also sought to trim the size of government by reducing the number of bureaucrats and their wages. Jo also believed that any talented people including slaves should be appointed as officials regardless of social status. He was said to judge people by moral character and did not greet superior officials if he considered them of unworthy characters while he was courteous even to his servants. For instance, he formed a friendship with a butcher/tanner of lowest class (baekjeong) who did not even have a name and admired his learning so much that he discussed state affairs with him and wanted to appoint him as a court official. But the tanner repeatedly refused Jo's offer and then disappeared without a trace according to Records of Yeonryeoshil (Ïó∞Î†§Ïã§Í∏∞Ïà†), a collection of official and unofficial history books compiled by Yi Geung-ik in late Joseon Dynasty. (It is said that King Injong, Jungjong's successor who admired his tutor Jo Gwangjo, listed the \\"tanner\\" as Chief State Councillor for his future cabinet for he was greatly admired by Jo.) According to famous Korean philosopher Yi I, Jo was admired so much by populace that when he appeared on streets people gathered before him saying, \\"Our master is coming.\\" Annals, September 21, 1562: \\"When Jo Gwangjo became Inspector General and passed the streets, everyone on street bowed to pay their respects. The slanderers claimed that he tried to gather popular support with a different purpose.\\" =Sarim's Power Base= Letter of Jo Kwang-jo Jo Gwangjo's radical reforms were popular with the populace, who called him the \\"living Buddha\\",Annals, January 19, 1520 but he faced fierce opposition and hostility from the Hungu faction. In early 1519, several Hungu officials began a plot to assassinate Sarim officials, though they were discovered in time.Annals, March 2, 1519 Jo's power base was concentrated in four offices: Inspector General's Office (ÏÇ¨ÌóåÎ∂Ä; whose main function was to impeach corrupt or unprincipled government officials in court and local administration), Office of Censors (ÏÇ¨Í∞ÑÏõê; whose role was to criticize wrong policies of the king or ministers), Hongmoongwan (ÌôçÎ¨∏Í¥Ä; an advisory council that answered the king's questions and educated the king with history and Confucian philosophy), and Royal Secretariat (ÏäπÏ†ïÏõê; which served as liaison between the king and ministries). The first three offices were collectively called Three Offices, or Samsa (ÏÇºÏÇ¨), as they provided checks and balance on the power of the king and the ministers and also served as organ of press that influenced general opinion of the court. However, the Sarim faction did not control any army nor had financial base. Sarim's power was solely dependent on the king's support, which Jo believed to be steadfast in their mutual pursuit of reforms. However, Jo's unbending character and his frequent remonstrations to Jungjong to support his radical programs began to irritate the king. Even when he disagreed with Jo, Jungjong almost always ended up adopting Jo's petition because Jo would refuse to bend his will and Three Offices would threaten to resign en masse. Furthermore, Jo and Hongmoongwan officials often instructed Jungjong on the ways of king in long lessons. Because Jungjong was not a crown prince, he had not received a thorough royal education expected of future king, and Sarim scholars sought to rectify this, believing that only learning could prevent a despot like Yeonsangun. Jungjong began to feel hounded by his subjects and resented it. The Hungu faction, which sensed Jungjong's irritation with Jo Gwangjo, found an opportunity to strike Sarim faction when Jo Gwangjo decided to go after the \\"heroes\\" of the 1506 coup that brought Jungjong to power. According to Jo, many officials who were awarded with special privileges including tax exemptions and huge stipends did not actually contribute much to the coup but gained their status through bribes or familial connections. He petitioned Jungjong to revoke such status from two thirds out of 110 people who received special status in connection with the coup. This move infuriated the Hungu faction, and they soon after proceeded to frame Jo Gwangjo with charges of disloyalty. =\\"Jo will become the King\\"= At the behest of Hungu leaders including Hong Kyung-ju, Nam Gon, and Shim Jung, Consort Gyeong of Park clan and Consort Hui of Hong clan (Hong Kyung- ju's daughter) sought to estrange Jungjong and Jo Gwangjo by often questioning Jo's loyalty and claiming that popular support was shifting to Jo. They told Jungjong that people were saying that it was actually Jo Gwangjo who ruled the country and that populace wanted to make him their king. Even if Jo was not disloyal, he would not be able to stop his supporters from doing so, they said.Annals, December 21, 1544 According to Annals of Joseon Dynasty, Nam Gon now set out to slander Jo and wrote a phrase \\"Ju cho will become the king\\" (Ï£ºÏ¥àÏúÑÏôï, Ëµ∞ËÇñÁà≤Áéã)\\" with honey or sugary water on mulberry leaves so that caterpillars left behind such phrase on leaves in the palace.Annals, September 21, 1568 When two Hanja (Chinese) characters \\"ju\\"(Ëµ∞) and \\"cho\\"(ËÇñ) are put together, they form a new Hanja character \\"jo\\"(Ë∂ô), which happen to be Jo Gwangjo's family name. Consort Hong or Consort Park showed the leaf to Jungjong and claimed that this was the heaven's warning that Jo would take the throne himself after eliminating Hungu faction. Jungjong, who himself rose to the throne through a coup d'√©tat, began to distrust Jo Gwangjo. [When Goryeo dynasty fell and was replaced by Joseon dynasty, there was popular saying \\"Son of wood will gain the country\\" (Î™©ÏûêÎìùÍµ≠ Êú®Â≠êÂæóÂúã). When two Hanja characters meaning wood(Êú®) and son(Â≠ê) are combined, they form a new character \\"yi\\"(Êùé), which happens to be the family name of Yi Seong-gye, who deposed the last king of Goryeo and founded Joseon dynasty. These phrases helped Yi Seong-gye win popular support for the new dynasty as heaven's will.] When Jo petitioned Jungjong to revoke special privileges of people who falsely contributed to 1506 coup, Jungjong's suspicion was further heightened. Now feeling certain that Jungjong was sufficiently estranged from Jo, Hong Kyung-ju secretly entered the palace to warn King Jungjong that the court was filled with Jo's supporters and that no one could dare oppose him openly. Jungjong dispatched a secret letter to Hong Kyung-ju, expressing his fear that Jo Gwangjo would next go after Hungu officials who did contribute to the coup by questioning legitimacy of the coup and then turn against the king himself.Annals, April 13, 1520 Jungjong instructed Hungu leaders to kill Jo Gwangjo and then inform him. On November 15, 1519, Hungu leaders entered the palace secretly at night to bypass Royal Secretariat and present to the king written charges against Jo: he and his supporters \\"deceived the king and put the state in disorder by forming a clique and abusing their positions to promote their supporters while excluding their opponents, and thereby misleading young people to make extremism into habit, causing the young to despise the old, the low-born to disrespect the high-born.\\" Annals, November 15, 1519 Inspector General Jo Gwangjo, Justice Minister Kim Jung, and six others were immediately arrested, and they were about to be killed extrajudicially without trial or even investigation. The whole event had appearance of coup d'√©tat except that it was sanctioned by the king. =\\"What is their crime?\\"= They would have been immediately killed except that War Minister Yi Jang-gon, who arrested Sarim officials, entreated that ministers should be consulted for such decision. The cabinet meeting on the following day regarding Jo's fate is described in detail in the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty. Most officials expressed their shock at Jo Gwangjo's arrest and Jungjong's intention to kill him.Annals, November 16, 1519, No. 12 They entreated that he may have been extreme in his youthful zeal to improve the country but could not possibly have private agenda. Chief State Councillor Jeong Gwang-pil said in tears: \\"I have frequently witnessed horrid calamities during the reign of deposed king (Yeonsangun), but how could I imagine to see such thing again even after meeting the wise king?\\" When Jungjong tried to leave, he even grasped the royal cloth to entreat further.Yi Geung-ik, Records of Yeonryeoshil He \\"could not understand on what charges the king wanted to punish them\\" for \\"mere demotion of 2-3 ranks would be already excessive.\\" Annals, November 16, 1519, No.12 Eighteen younger officials requested to the king to imprison them with Jo Gwangjo.Annals, November 16, 1519, No.7 State Council and Six Ministries jointly entreated that punishing Jo and others on such charges without evidence would become a blot on the king's reputation.Annals, November 16, 1519, No.20 Even Hong Sook, who became Justice Minister overnight and interrogated Jo, reported to the king that he was \\"deeply moved\\" by Jo's loyalty. New Inspector General Yu Eun, who replaced Jo, protested in even stronger terms: \\"If Jo Gwangjo is guilty of crime, he should be punished in open and just manner... Instead, Your Majesty is handing out such punishment according to secret words by two people in the middle of night... What is so difficult about punishing few seonbis with authority of king that Your Majesty should do so covertly by sending a secret message?... If there is a crime, it should be dealt with clearly and justly, but Your Majesty appeared to trust and be friendly with them on the outside while thinking of eliminating them in mind.\\" Annals, November 18, 1519 He was finally dismissed after asking Jungjong to \\"cut my head to please the wicked people.\\" Annals, December 30, 1528 Meanwhile, 150 Seonggyungwan students stormed the palace to protest Jo's arrest and filled the palace with shouts of entreaties,Annals, November 16, 1519, No.13 and later 240 students petitioned to claim Jo's innocence and requested to be imprisoned together.Annals, November 17, 1519 There was such popular outpouring for Jo's release that it may have increased Jungjong's suspicion and anger., Reformer Jo Kwang-jo (in Korean) =Third Literati Purge of 1519= Portrait of Jo Gwangjo Jo Gwangjo was completely caught off guard with this turn of events. The Sarim faction had scored its biggest victory just four days ago when Jungjong granted their petition to revoke special status for 70 Hungu officials. He continued to believe that Jungjong was misled by his enemies and was confident that he could persuade the king of his loyalty once he could face him in the interrogation. He wrote to Jungjong of his fear for this incident becoming a bloody purge and entreated that he would not regret dying ten thousand times if only he could be granted an audience.Annals, November 16, 1915, No.11 However, he would never have a chance to see Jungjong again. Amid petitions for leniency, Jungjong commuted the death sentence to exile, and Jo Gwangjo was exiled to Neung-ju. Nevertheless, Jungjong was determined to put Jo Gwangjo to death. In the Annals, there was no official demand for Jo's death, not even by Hong Kyung- joo, Nam Gon, and Shim Jung, except for a petition by three Seunggyungwan students Annals, December 14, 1519 (as opposed to 300 who petitioned for his release).Annals, November 19, 1519, No.2 Nam Gon rather urged against executing Jo multiple times even as he was adding more and more names to the list of people to be purged through exile or dismissal.Annals, December 14, 1519, No.3 Yet Jungjong turned against Jo with the same intensity as when he favored him. He reinstated death sentence by poison for Jo less than a month after their exile. He fired many ministers who entreated on Jo's behalf including Chief State Councillor Jeong Gwang-pill, Deputy State Councillor Ahn Dang, and even War Minister Yi Jang-gon, who took part in arresting Sarim officials. Jo Gwangjo still could not believe Jungjong's heart really turned against him and hoped to be recalled by the king, keeping a north door open each day during exile. Even when soldiers arrived with poison, he was suspicious that Hungu leaders might be trying to kill him without Jungjong's approval. But when he learned that Nam Gon and Shim Jung became Vice State Councillor and Minister of Personnel, he finally realized that Jungjong's change of heart was final.Annals, December 16, 1519 Before drinking the poison, Jo wrote a poem declaring his loyalty, asked his people not to make coffin too heavy, and apologized to the owner and servant of the house for not paying his debt and instead showing them terrible sight and desecrating their house. He then bowed four times toward the north in the direction of palace. (It was customary to pay respect to the king in gratitude for granting poison, which was not an official method of execution and was considered more honorable form of death, instead of beheading or hanging.) When he drank poison, he did not die immediately and soldiers tried to strangle him. Jo rebuked them saying that the king intended to spare his neck by sending the poison and requested for another bowl of poison. He died at the age of 37. Later when there was a severe drought in the country, the populace blamed that it was heaven's punishment for killing an innocent seonbi. Weekly Donga, \\"Dream of reform cut by the conspiracy\\" December 15, 2009 Many of remaining Sarim scholars left the central government in protest and retreated to rural provinces. Most of Jo's reforms were revoked with his fall. The Third Literati Purge of 1519 (Í∏∞Î¨òÏÇ¨Ìôî Â∑±ÂçØÂ£´Á¶ç) was widely viewed as a missed opportunity to reform Joseon Dynasty by later generations because Joseon politics soon degenerated into power struggle among in-laws and relatives of the royal family. A year after the purge, a histographer wrote that bribery and corruption became widespread in the court and local administrations.Annals. November 16, 1520 Later, purge victims were venerated as \\"Wise Men of Gimyo\\" (Gimyo is the Korean calendar name for year 1519) while three main instigators (Hong Kyung- ju, Nam Gon, and Shim Jung) were collectively called \\"Evil Three of Gimyo\\". Hong Kyung-ju died two years later of natural causes, but Shim Jung and Consort Kyung of Park clan were later executed on a framed charge of cursing the crown prince in a plot concocted by their rival Kim Anro (Kim Anro was killed by rival Yoon Won-hyung, who in turn was purged by King Myeongjong - Shim, Kim, and Yoon are all considered some of the most corrupt officials in Joseon dynasty). Nam Gon, who was reportedly deeply saddened at Jo's death, regretted his role in the purge and willed that all his writings be burnt, saying that he \\"deceived the world with vain name,\\" so no writing of his remains except for one short poem although he was one of the most famous writers of his time. Nam Gon, initially of Sarim faction as a disciple of Kim Jong-jik, was a moderate supporter of reforms and supposedly sought Jo Gwangjo's friendship but was rebuffed by Jo and his supporters as a petty Hungu official.Originally consulted from this page in Korean http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LPOD‚à£=etc&oid;=036&aid;=0000009053 Ten years after the purge, King Jungjong again began to advance Sarim scholars by recalling them from exile and reappointing them to the royal court. Nevertheless, Jungjong did not rehabilitate Jo Gwangjo's name to the end despite endless petitions, saying at one time that what happened in 1519 was \\"neither right nor wrong.\\" Annals, April 7, 1544 (There is speculation as to what Jungjong really believed about the leaf incident since Jungjong never accused Jo of disloyalty or anything but pure intentions after first few days of Jo's arrest. From very early on, Jungjong's official position has been that Jo intended well but caused a situation that could only be rectified with a purge.) Jo Gwangjo was finally rehabilitated by his son Injong of Joseon, and was posthumously honored as a chief state councillor by Seonjo of Joseon in 1568. =Legacy= Jo Gwangjo was greatly venerated by later generations of Korean neo-Confucianists as their spiritual head, but was also criticized for mistakes that led to the failure of his reforms. Yi Hwang and Yi I, often considered Joseon's two greatest Confucian philosophers, lamented that he entered politics too early before his scholarship was completed and pursued his reforms too rapidly. Nevertheless, Yi Hwang praised him as one of \\"Four Wise of the East\\" along with Kim Gwoeng-pil, Jeong Yeo-chang, and Yi Eonjeok and said that Jo showed the direction for all seonbis to aim and follow and unveiled the foundation of governing a country. Jo Gwangjo's emphasis on neo- Confucian ethics as practical philosophy has been very influential as the previous focus has been on more literary aspects of Confucianism. It was also during his time that Confucianism finally took roots deeply among the common populace. Even though Confucianism was the official state religion since the founding of Joseon Dynasty, Confucian practices were largely limited to aristocratic class. His dream of making neo-Confucianism the predominant philosophy of Joseon was soon accomplished by the reign of Seonjo, fifty years after his death. He was canonized and enshrined in the Seonggyungwan in 1610, one of only eighteen Korean Confucian scholars so honored by the Joseon Dynasty. However, Sarim faction that venerated Jo Gwangjo's name did not attempt to carry out his reforms when they seized political power during Seonjo's reign and all the while they maintained power until the end of Joseon dynasty. Some people blame Jo Gwangjo for dogmatism of Korean Neo- Confucianism, which became very conservative and caused Korea to resist changes and new learnings from abroad. Today his name remains a byword for reform in Korea, and his example is often raised when there is a controversy about a reform. Modern portrayal his disciple and successor Baik In-geol Jo Gwangjo was the protagonist of 1996 KBS TV series Jo Gwangjo and was a prominent character in 2001 SBS TV series Ladies of the Palace. In MBC TV series Dae Jang Geum (2003-4), he does not appear as a character, but his name is mentioned frequently (often as Jo Jung-ahm) as the political foe of fictitious villain Right Minister Oh. Main protagonist Jang-geum and Lady Han are falsely accused of being in conspiracy with Jo Gwangjo while male protagonist Min Jung-ho is portrayed as his supporter (Min Jung-ho found a doctor for him and is shown recruiting his followers to return to politics). In the musical version of Dae Jang Geum, Jo Gwangjo is a prominent character as a friend of Min Jung-ho. In KBS TV series Immortal Admiral Yi Sun-sin (2004-5), Yi Sun-shin's grandfather is described to have been executed for supporting Jo Gwangjo and Yi's father is arrested while holding a memorial rite at Jo's abandoned house. In 2006 KBS series Hwang Jini, the male protagonist Kim Jeong-han is portrayed as Jo Gwangjo's disciple while another character Lee Saeng become Hwang Jini's bodyguard after he leaves his father's home in disgust because his father is Jo Gwango-jo's friend but betrays him to become prime minister. In these three dramas, Jo Gwangjo does not appear as a character but serves as a plot device to set the main characters as righteous people by association.

History  In the 1960s, the area north of Wilmington (referred to as Brandywine Hundred) was growing rapidly. The school district (then known as the Alfred I. DuPont School district) was opening new schools as rapidly as possible. Soon, it became apparent that the one high school in the district, Brandywine High School, would not be able to handle the increase in students. The district decided to open a second high school rather than expand the existing one. The student body for the new high school was developed slowly. At first, students from the existing two junior high schools (Forwood and Springer) were selected based on where they lived to attend the yet to be built high school. The first year (1967‚Äì68), Concord High School was held at the then new Hanby Junior High and consisted of 9th and 10th graders. The students met in the top floor while elementary students attended classes in the lower floor while their school was being built. The following year (1968‚Äì69), the student body was expanded to 9th, 10th and 11th grades and the elementary students were moved out to their new home. During this period, the Concord High School building was under construction and planned to open in the fall of 1969. However, a worker strike and construction issues delayed its opening. Since the school was not completed, the student body now consisting of 10th through 12th grades was forced out of their temporary home at Hanby Junior High and into the Brandywine High School building on double sessions. Brandywine High School students attended their school in the morning, while the Concord students attended in the afternoon. Concord High School finally opened in January 1970 and the first senior class graduated a few months later in June. Even though the school was open, construction was not completed in several areas including the gym, auditorium and swimming pool until the fall of 1970. The first principal, Dr. William J. Bailey, promoted what was, at the time, a progressive environment that emphasized trust and responsibility among the students. Students were given then unheard of freedoms and responsibilities, which worked extremely well during the progressive periods of the late 1960s and early 1970s. For example, there was no dress code for students or teachers; there was a students' designated smoking area near the bus stops at the front of the building and a rotating schedule was in place with a free period which the students could use as they pleased, including listening to music in the cafeteria, reading in the library, or doing independent study in the classrooms. At one face-to-face between Dr. Bailey and the senior class Bailey was asked if there could be a \\"Senior Odd Day\\" at the school. Bailey paused, looked around the auditorium and jokingly said...\\"every day's senior odd day at this school.\\" Some courses were offered on a non-graded basis, meaning students were placed depending on their abilities rather than their age. For example, English was offered in 5 levels of mastery and each level could have students from all three grades (10‚Äì12). Grading earned within each level was still the traditional A ‚Äì F. Bailey left in the mid-1970s to become a professor of education at the University of Delaware.

WAVPM was organized in January 1977, following the San Francisco Women's Centers Conference on Violence Against Women.Bronstein, Carolyn. (2011).

Founding members included Laura Lederer, Lynn Campbell, Diana Russell, Kathleen Barry, and Susan Griffin.\\"Political Curriculum Vitae\\" by Diana Russell, DianaRussel.com, January 21, 2004. It became highly active in San Francisco, picketing strip clubs and peep shows in San Francisco's red- light districts. Its first public political action was a picket of the Mitchell Brothers O'Farrell Theatre, a strip club and live sex venue. The specific target of the protest was the theater's Ultra Room, which was a live show that featured women performing sadomasochistic acts on one another. WAVPM objected to \\"women beat[ing] each other for men's sexual stimulation.\\" WAVPM also sponsored educational tours of pornography stores and peep shows in San Francisco's red-light districts and anti-pornography slide shows, both forms of activism later adopted by other anti-pornography feminist groups, notably Women Against Pornography in New York City. WAVPM, like later anti-pornography feminists, was also strongly opposed to BDSM, seeing it as ritualized violence against women, and took a particularly active role in opposing it within the lesbian community. This set them on a direct collision course with Samois, an early lesbian sadomasochist group who WAVPM strongly rebuked and whose functions they sometimes picketed. Samois members felt strongly that their way of practicing SM was entirely compatible with feminism, and held that the kind of feminist sexuality advocated by WAVPM was conservative and puritanical. Samois openly confronted WAVPM with their position, and the exchanges between Samois and WAVPM were among the earliest battles of what later became known as the Feminist Sex Wars.Rubin, Gayle. 2004. \\"Samois\\" . Leather Times 21:3-7. The group organized the first national conference of anti-pornography feminists in San Francisco in November 1978. The conference concluded with the first-ever Take Back the Night march. Andrea Dworkin gave a speech at the rally, and then about three thousand women marched through the red light district in protest of rape and pornography.Brownmiller, Susan 1999. In Our Time: Memoir of a Revolution. After the conference, Susan Brownmiller approached Laura Lederer and Lynn Campbell and encouraged them to come to New York City to help in organizing Women Against Pornography. Lederer decided to stay in San Francisco to edit an anthology based on the conference presentations, but Campbell took up the offer and left for New York in April 1979.Lederer, Laura. 1982. Take Back the Night. . WAVPAM became less active soon after Campbell's departure, though the group stayed active for several more years. At its peak, the group had over 1000 members. The group became mired in disagreements over stances on non-violent pornography, free speech issues, and attempts to reconcile with sex worker and lesbian BDSM activists, as well as having problems with fundraising and mounting debt. WAVPM disbanded in 1983.

It was published in 2000. The book describes the author's experiences during four months spent in Bosnia in 1995‚Äì96,Fantagraphics Books. Summary of Safe Area Gora≈æde . URL accessed April 25, 2006. and is based on conversations with Bosniaks trapped within the enclave of Gora≈æde. Sacco combines the oral histories of his interviewees with his own observations on conditions in the enclave as well as his feelings about being in a danger zone. He keeps his primary focus on roughly half a dozen people, which helps to structure the collection of vignettes into something of a narrative, while also including interviews with a number of other people. Sacco stands back and lets the interviewees tell their stories, keeping his editorializing and personal reflections to interludes. Plot summary Joe Sacco visits Gora≈æde, a mainly Bosniak enclave in eastern Bosnia surrounded by hostile Serb- dominated regions. Sacco visits the locals and gets a first-hand view of the war's brutal effect on the town. The story of Gora≈æde develops through the narrations of Edin, a graduate student who was studying engineering in Sarajevo before the war, and other residents of Gora≈æde. Yugoslavia had been a multi-ethnic country and its cultural pluralism was proudly propagandized throughout the world. Edin and many others recall having fun with their Serb and Croat friends during the Josip Broz Tito era. However, after the death of the charismatic former Partisan leader, the newly elected president of Serbia Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá begins to incite extreme Serb nationalism among the Serb population. By bringing back the painful memories before the Tito era in which bloody conflicts raged between Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks, he succeeds in inciting chauvinistic sentiment among the Serbs. The republics of Slovenia and Croatia, intimidated by the development of the situation, declare independence from Yugoslavia. The political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is rapidly deteriorating. The Serbian Democratic Party led by Radovan Karad≈æiƒá represents the ethnic Serbs and is against disintegration; the Party of Democratic Action and the Croatian Democratic Union, respectively representing Bosniaks and Croats, are in favor of breaking apart from the Yugoslav federation. Bosnian Serbs, fearing that once Bosnia gains independence they would be persecuted by the numerically superior Bosniaks and Croats, organize their armed forces and prepare for the upcoming war. The tension among nations is now visible; Serbs and Bosniaks now go to separate caf√©s. Vigilantes raised from both sides patrol the streets and night for fear of Serb/Bosniak attack. Amid this atmosphere, Edin returns home from Sarajevo to protect his family. The first attack on the community is realized in 1992. Bosniaks are caught unaware, and many lose their family members and loved ones while escaping from the indiscriminate attack. In the joint offensive of Bosnian Army and Bosniak militias captured Gora≈æde. They find their homes looted and burnt by Serbs. Bosniaks who couldn't escape and were caught by the Serbs were killed in horrendous manners and buried en masse, amongst them Edin's friends. Refugees who flocked from nearby towns of Vi≈°egrad and Foƒça testify their accounts of atrocities committed by Serbs, among them mass executions, rapes, etc. Residents of Gora≈æde try to maintain life in the town, now sieged by Serb- dominated areas of Republika Srpska. They suffer from destruction of basic infrastructures, shortage of utilities such as electricity, and hunger. Food supplies airlifted by U.S. C-130s flown from Germany help relieve food shortages, but Bosniaks have to risk their lives in the long winter trail to reach the airdropped packages. In 1994, the town is subjected to a second major Serb offensive. This offensive, orchestrated by the Serb general Ratko Mladiƒá, is in scale much larger than the first offensive, and causes massive destruction to the town. Edin and other Bosniak militiamen desperately try to defend Gora≈æde from the enemy that outnumbers them. Meanwhile, the international society is blind to the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gora≈æde. Despite having designated Gora≈æde a 'safe area', the United Nations and its military arm in former Yugoslavia, UNPROFOR, make no effort to stop the Serb advance for fear that UN could also be implicated in the conflict and compromise its neutrality. Only after pleas for intervention from the Bosnian president Alija Izetbegoviƒá, and the terrible situation in Gora≈æde reaches media and sparks international indignation do the UN and the United States respond with bombings on major Serb military positions. The bombings stop the attack and the people of Gora≈æde once again manage to defend their village at a heavy cost of 700 dead, most of them civilians. A contingent of British peacekeepers are stationed in Gora≈æde thereafter to supervise the disarmament process of the militias. There were also a few Serbs whose loyalties stood with the Republic of Bosnia and chose to remain in Gora≈æde throughout the war. They were despised by the Bosniak refugees, who lost everything they had at the hands of Serbs; they were equally hated by the Serb militias, who took them for traitors and threatened to kill them. In 1995 Gen. Mladiƒá plans another offensive in eastern Bosnia and takes it into action. The offensive succeeds due to the inaction of the UN peacekeeping forces. Serb forces take Dutch peacekeepers hostages, and assault the towns of Srebrenica and ≈Ωepa, both designated 'safe areas' by the UN. Bosnian forces firmly believed that the UN troops would protect them from attack, hence they were totally unprepared. Both Srebrenica and ≈Ωepa fall to the Serbs. Over 8,000 Bosniak males were massacred in Srebrenica, while the Bosniak population in ≈Ωepa was expelled. The UN's peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia have failed. After suffering much diplomatic humiliation at the hands of Bosnian Serbs, the United States begins bombing strategic Serb positions. Now the Serbs have turned the rest of the world their enemy; a joint Croat-Bosnian offensive drives most Serbs out of northern Bosnia, and the Serbs return to the negotiating table. Sacco came to Gora≈æde in the immediate aftermath of these events through the 'blue road', a narrow road opened by the UN peacekeepers that links sieged Gora≈æde to the rest of Bosnia. The Serbs, Bosniaks and Croats finally come to an agreement, and the Dayton Accords is adopted. Among the conditions for peace, Gora≈æde is not to be receded to the Serbs and both sides are required to demobilize their troops. Edin and other residents of Gora≈æde rejoice at this news. However, townsfolk point out that there is still much more to go. According to the agreement, Bosniak refugees evicted from their homes can return to their homes, but no refugee would dare enter Serb-dominated areas without any assurance of safety. Sacco re-visits Gora≈æde a year later. Much has changed within a year. The 'blue road', which only aid workers, peace-keepers and journalists could pass through, is now open to everybody. Life goes on in Gora≈æde. A Benetton merchandise shop has opened in Sarajevo. Edin and his friend Riki go to Sarajevo to resume their studies. Edin has no time to waste; he has wasted the most important period in his life in battlefields. He now must get used to everything.

Continuously in production since 2003, the VLocity is the highest-speed train in the V/Line fleet, with a top speed of 210 km/h (limited to 160 km/h due to infrastructure) and a cruising speed of . As of September 2020, 81 3-car sets are in service with 7 undergoing testing, and 18 more under construction. History =Design origins and testing= To honour a commitment made when it was awarded the V/Line franchise, National Express requested tenders in early 2000 for 29 two-carriage diesel multiple units. The order, which coincided with the Regional Fast Rail project then being undertaken by the state government, was awarded to Adtranz's Dandenong factory in mid-November with a value of . The contract was extended to 38 two- car units and an initial fifteen-year maintenance contract. By the time the first was delivered, the V/Line franchise had reverted to the state government, while Adtranz had been taken over by Bombardier Transportation. The design was an evolution of the Xplorer/Endeavour railcars. Although Bombardier originally intended to use the same body shell design as the Endeavour, difficulties with the aerodynamic drag characteristics of this shape for the intended operational speed of the VLocity led to a complete redesign of the train body. Ultimately, the VLocity was designed concurrently with the B series being developed for Transperth as an electric multiple unit, resulting in a number of shared design elements. The original plan was for the 29 sets to be fitted with 2+3 seating, for a total capacity of 173 passengers per two-carriage set. However, in February 2003, that was changed to 144 seats in a 2+2 formation. In 2003, it was announced that the units would be built in Bombardier's Dandenong factory, with the bogies to be constructed at Bombardier's Derby Litchurch Lane Works in England, and the control system to be supplied by Bombardier's plant in V√§ster√•s, Sweden. The first unit was completed in July 2004, and testing began shortly after. The trains were tested at 160 km/h for the first time on 17 September, when Premier Steve Bracks joined a test run along a route from Warragul to Moe. Safety improvements were suggested at various stages in the development of the VLocity and, following the Waterfall accident in New South Wales, in which a train derailed when travelling too fast around a curve, and the Cairns Tilt Train derailment in Queensland, which occurred in similar circumstances, the State Government announced in December 2004 that the Train Protection & Warning System (TPWS) would be installed on Regional Fast Rail lines and the VLocity trains. In August 2005, the State Government commissioned an investigation into the fitting of seat belts on the trains, although the concept was considered potentially expensive and technically challenging. Testing revealed noise levels were too high in the cabin, delaying the introduction of the trains into service while the completed sets were modified. =Into service= Unrefurbished Interior of VLocity VL24 The VLocity was introduced into service on the Ballarat line on 22 December 2005, with Bracks and Transport Minister Peter Batchelor travelling on the inaugural service from Southern Cross station. An unveiling ceremony was held at Ballarat and the train returned as a regular service. Services on the Geelong and Bendigo lines followed on 3 February 2006 and 24 February 2006 respectively. Services to Traralgon and Seymour were introduced in September 2006. A timetable allowing the VLocity to operate at its design speed was introduced on 3 September, despite allegations by the State Opposition of ongoing issues with the TPWS. In addition, the Ararat and Echuca services are operated by VLocitys. From 2010, one Ballarat line service each day was extended to Maryborough. In 2005, the Vlocity received an Australian Design Award, the first rail vehicle to do so, as well as an accolade from Engineers Australia. On 10 November 2008, seven-carriage-long VLocity trains commenced regular operation on peak-hour Geelong line services. Previously, the longest trains were six carriages. =Additions to the fleet= Chart showing the number of VLocity carriages ordered and in service at the end of each financial year from 2001 to 2018. After the initial order of 38 units, a further two VLocity units were later ordered to bring the total to 40, along with 22 new intermediate trailers to be inserted in the middle of existing VLocity sets. The first 14 were promised during the 2006 State Election, and the order was placed in December the same year. The order for the next eight was announced on 12 October 2007. In July 2008, the State Government ordered nine new three-car units, and an additional intermediate car to be inserted into an existing two-car unit, with an extra four carriages added in February 2009. The final unit of the order was delivered in September 2011. With the availability of improved technologies for train control, from mid-2012, sets VL30, VL40 and VL50 were selected by Bombardier as test sets for equipment upgrades, in order to minimise the number of sets containing non-standard systems. In November 2012, the State Government announced an additional 40 carriages will be delivered between 2014 and 2016. The order comprised seven additional 3-car sets plus 19 intermediate cars to increase the remaining 2-car sets to 3-cars. In March 2014, the order for 40 carriages was increased to 43. Further orders were placed for 21 carriages In May 2015 and 27 carriages in April 2016.$257 Million for New Regional Trains and Local Jobs Premier of Victoria 1 May 2015Public transport investments in 2016/17 Victorian Budget Public Transport Victoria 27 April 2016 In December 2017, a further nine sets were ordered.

Sets from 80-88 will revert to two toilets with modified seating and a different front to accommodate a safer driving cabin. As of 3 May 2020 units 80-84 are undergoing commissioning and not yet entered traffic. After jockey Michelle Payne won the 2015 Melbourne Cup horse race riding Prince of Penzance, becoming the first female jockey to win the race, set VL09 was named Michelle Payne in honour of her regional Victorian ancestry. The set was the first VLocity to be named and the first V/Line train to be named since the Sprinters in the late 20th century. In the 2018 Victorian state election campaign, the Andrews government promised that, if re-elected, it would place an order for 18 additional three-car VLocity sets to be delivered from 2021. =Wheel wear restrictions= In January 2016, V/Line removed approximately a quarter of VLocity units from service after identifying unusually high rates of wear to wheel flanges. Compared to a normal rate of , Bombardier's service regime noted a maximum wear rate of . Although unusual wear patterns had been observed since December of the previous year across the V/Line fleet, V/Line CEO Theo Taifalos ordered the withdrawal of the most badly affected units for safety reasons. Meanwhile, on 15 January 2016 a VLocity set failed to activate boom gates at the Progress Street level crossing in Dandenong. This led Metro Trains to ban all sets from operating on suburban lines until the issue had been resolved. The combined restrictions on the VLocity fleet led to the daily cancellation of nearly 70 V/Line services from mid-January. By the beginning of March, Bombardier had increased its capacity to remachine affected wheels, and track identified as potentially contributing to the wheel wear situation had been reprofiled; as a consequence, VLocity units were gradually returned to service. In April, a report by the Institute of Railway Technology at Monash University identified tight curves and an inadequate track lubrication on the newly opened Regional Rail Link as the root cause of the increase in wheel wear, and suggested that the relatively stiff suspension of the VLocity was the reason it had been most severely affected. =Design evolution= The New Generation Rollingstock ordered for Queensland Rail from Bombardier will be based on the VLocity design and the A-City Class 4000 EMU used by Adelaide Metro, which was itself based on the VLocity shell. A 2016 asset management report presented by V/Line noted that the VLocity would be unsuitable for higher passenger loads without a complete body redesign, and acknowledged that the operational performance of the VLocity was hampered by the inferior acceleration of V/Line's locomotive-hauled fleet. The 2016‚Äì17 Victorian budget allocated funds for a project to redesign the VLocity for long-haul services, particularly those to Shepparton, Warrnambool and Albury/Wodonga. By late 2017, design work had begun on modifications to the interior for units VL76-VL79. Many of the changes were required for improved compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act. For the later order of VL80 and above, more significant alterations to the crash protection in the driver's cabin were introduced. In October 2018, the state government announced that a new interior layout would be introduced on units VL76-VL88 with 14 extra seats per three-carriage set, at the expense of removing a toilet and bike storage rack from each set. Cycling lobby groups criticised the new layout, but the government argued that the sets would be restricted to short-distance routes where the additional capacity would be valuable. The first of the updated type entered service in August 2019. =Introduction to long-distance service= North Shore in September 2017 In the lead up to the 2018 Victorian election, opposition leader Matthew Guy announced that his party, if elected to government, would order 16 6-car VLocity variants from Bombardier for dedicated long-distance operation, with catering and first class facilities. From May 2018, improvements to level crossing infrastructure saw test VLocity runs to Bairnsdale, ahead of an introduction to revenue service on the line later in the year. At the same time, government representatives announced that the long-haul variant of the VLocity would include onboard refreshment facilities and improved seats. A media event was held at Bairnsdale in July of that year, at which it was announced that 2 of 3 daily Bairnsdale trains would be taken over by VLocity sets. V/Line expects to replace its entire locomotive-hauled fleet with VLocity units by 2022. As part of this process, Bombardier has investigated several concepts for the installation of catering facilities into trains for long-haul services. In May 2018, the Rail Tram and Bus Union (RTBU) announced that it had received confirmation that a buffet facility would be included in new intermediate carriages, added to existing sets to form 4-car trains for long-distance services. In April 2020, designs for standard gauge VLocity sets, to be used on the Albury line, were released by the Department of Transport. Design =Technical= There are three car types in the VLocity class: the Driver Motor with Disabled Access cars, numbered 11xx and designated DM(D); the Driver Motor cars, numbered 12xx and designated DM; and the Trailer Motor cars, numbered 13xx and designated TM. It is usual for the set of semi-permanently coupled cars to be described as VLxx where xx is the final two digits of the car designation ‚Äì for example, the set 1150-1350-1250 would be described as VL50. Power is provided by a Cummins QSK 19R diesel engine () in each car, attached on a separate underframe. The engine powers both axles on one bogie in each car, while the other bogie is unpowered. The engine is supplemented by an Cummins auxiliary power unit for lighting and air-conditioning purposes. The VLocity uses a Voith T312 hydraulic transmission system with dynamic braking capabilities. According to engine manufacturer, Cummins, the VLocitys are the most reliable diesel railcars in the world, as a result of that propulsion system, with a mean distance between failures (MDBF) of . V/Line reported a MDBF of in the 2016‚Äì17 financial year. The primary suspension system of the VLocity is composed of a traction rod, with two elastomer bushes, linking the axle box and bogie frame. Among the design innovations in the VLocity units are the integration of the air-conditioning unit into the ceiling superstructure, and a structurally isolated crumple zone in the nose which can be entirely replaced with a new module following a crash. VLocity units use Scharfenberg couplers, enabling them to operate with other VLocity units. VLocitys operate on the broad gauge, as with most other V/Line services. The bogies were manufactured by Bombardier's Derby Litchurch Lane Works, and are fully gauge-convertible to standard gauge. The units have a design life of 35 years. =Interior= The driver's console for the VLocity is a dashboard mounted slightly below the one-piece front windscreen of the train. There are two seats in the driving cabin; the active driver's seat is positioned slightly to the left of the train's centre, with the second seat slightly behind. The train is controlled by a combined throttle and brake lever, which has six power levels and the ability to vary the brake application. There is also an independent brake lever and a reverser handle in the driver's primary controls. The seating layout for the VLocity is 2+2, with a mix of club-style seats facing each other, and aircraft-style rows. The seats cannot be rotated to face any particular direction, and seat backs do not recline. Four wheelchair spaces are provided in each set through the provision of tip-up seats. The VLocity offers economy-class seating only, although the seat width is equivalent to first class seating on V/Line locomotive-hauled services. In response to passenger feedback, the seatback angle in the intermediate carriages was made 2.5 degrees more upright than the original carriages. New deliveries from July 2010 onwards (VL42 and above) featured a changed seatback angle and new seat fabrics. While VLocity carriages have tinted windows, they lack the curtains as provided by older V/Line rolling stock. Passengers may move freely between the two or three semi-permanently coupled vehicles in a set, but not between the sets themselves. Conductors move between coupled sets at station stops. Tables were installed in one unit (VL28) for evaluation purposes, but were later removed. In three-car VLocity units, 32 seats in the intermediate carriage have fold-down tray tables, much like the first class seats on locomotive-hauled services. Overhead racks exist for small baggage, while larger baggage is stored in the middle of the unit, with some spaces large enough for surfboards and bicycles. In January 2008, passengers were banned from taking bicycles on VLocity trains during peak hours, despite the designated bike area,Train bike ban sparks protest ABC News 23 January 2008 with the ban repealed in February 2008.Minister lifts bicycle ban on peak-hour trains The Age 15 February 2008 =Livery= Little River in November 2006 The original VLocity livery consisted of purple and green facings on a stainless steel car body. In March 2008, newly built VLocity set VL41 was outshopped with an altered cab livery following recommendations in recent level crossing accident reports to make trains more visible to motorists. Portions of reflective yellow were added to the cabs, along with more reflective silver directly beneath the cab windscreen. All units were retrospectively treated. In June 2010, newly built set VL42 was released in a new livery of crimson stripe at roof level replacing the purple, and red replacing the green, a red stripe along the car body below the windows, white doors, and yellow front. The set also received high-intensity discharge (HID) headlights which project light for up to 1 kilometre, modified windscreen wipers and cab windows. In 2014, VL40 had a new Public Transport Victoria livery applied. All sets from VL52 were delivered in this livery. Reception and impact As the VLocity seating layout is 2+2, instead of the 2+3 seating provided in other V/Line saloon-type carriages, the VLocity is less suited to crush loads than older rolling stock. A single VLocity car seats around 70 passengers, compared to 89 in the previous generation Sprinter with its narrower 2+3 seats. The Regional Fast Rail project for which the VLocitys were built was criticised for cost blow-outs during construction. These included the cost of installing extra safety measures deemed necessary for 160 km/h operation, which were added to the project after the Waterfall rail accident in New South Wales. By 2012, the VLocity trains and attendant decreases in travel time were regarded as major factors in the economic revival of towns along V/Line routes. The combined effect of the trains' comfort, speed and reliability was noted to have enabled the creation of new commuter belt locations outside of Melbourne, and the increases in train frequency which followed the introduction of the VLocity sets was said to have substantially improved the convenience of accessing Melbourne from the Bendigo, Ballarat and Geelong regions. A 2014 report by the federal government's Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development found that the VLocity trains had contributed to the overall success of the Regional Fast Rail project in increasing the accessibility of rail services for regional Victoria. The case study concluded that the improved ride quality of the trains was a significant contributor to improved passenger perceptions of rail services, and that the increased service frequency made possible by the trains was ultimately more beneficial from an operational perspective than any real or perceived time savings. Accidents and incidents On 28 April 2006, set VL29 was involved in a collision at a level crossing at Trawalla while travelling from Ararat. It collided with a large triaxle road trailer carrying a 16-tonne block of stone and two heavy press machines. The front of the train withstood the impact with the trailer, but the press machines were thrown loose, striking and penetrating the cab. The incident caused two fatalities. At the time of the impact, three people were in the cab, the driver ‚Äì who was seriously injured ‚Äì and two off-duty Pacific National drivers ‚Äì one of whom was injured, and the other killed. As the train continued through the crossing, the rear trailer swung around and the stone block was thrown off, striking and partially penetrating the side of the leading car 1129, killing the mother of the train driver, who had been travelling as a passenger. Forty others received injuries in the crash. The unit had been in service for seven days before the accident. After the accident, both cars were taken to Newport Workshops for examination. Carriage 1129 suffered the most damage and was written off. Carriage 1229, having received relatively minor damage, was sent to Bombardier, Dandenong for repairs. It was later renumbered 1241 and marshalled together with new cars 1141 and 1341. On 5 May 2006, VLocity set VL04 travelling on the 09:38 service from Southern Cross to Ararat collided with a car at the protected Rockbank level crossing near Melton. Thirty train passengers and the driver of the car were taken to hospital. During a passenger service to Bendigo on 26 February 2010, the driver of sets VL6, VL5 and VL17, at the time three two-car sets coupled in that order, was alerted to the smell of smoke in the leading car of VL5. The train stopped at Watergardens, where the driver and a relief driver also on board the train discovered a fire in the park brake system of VL5, which they were able to extinguish quickly. VL6 was decoupled and continued to Bendigo without incident. An investigation found that the park brake had either not been released on departure or had been inadvertently activated by the relief driver, who was travelling in the empty cab of the VL5 lead car. On 22 August 2014, a Metro Trains Comeng train, which had departed Laverton en route to Flinders Street, stopped after the driver noticed a loud noise and an apparent fault in his train's braking system. VLocity set VL05, which was being transferred from Geelong to Southern Cross without passengers, passed a red automatic signal without adhering to safe procedures for that situation, and the driver was unable to stop before colliding with the stationary Metro train. The driver of the VLocity and 8 passengers on the Metro train sustained minor injuries. An investigation by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau found that the driver of the VLocity, travelling too fast for the situation, was distracted and failed to notice the inadequate rear marker lights of the Metro train. On 15 February 2017, VLocity set VL34 collided with a vehicle that had been abandoned on the line near and was derailed. Two people were injured. Operations Technically, a maximum of four VLocity sets may be coupled together for operation as a single consist. Between 2008 and 2016, seven-car VLocity trains operated on the Geelong line, made up of two two-car sets and a three-car set. However, following the conversion of the entire VLocity fleet to three-car sets, all trains have operated as three or six cars. Operation of 9-car trains would be possible only with infrastructure improvements such as platform extension at a number of stations. The VLocity is authorised to run in revenue service: * on the North East line from Melbourne to Seymour * on the Gippsland line from Melbourne to Sale and Bairnsdale * on the Bendigo line from Melbourne to Bendigo, and then to Eaglehawk on the Yungera line and Echuca on the Echuca line * on the Warrnambool line from Melbourne to Waurn Ponds * on the Serviceton line to Ballarat and then to Ararat, and from Ballarat to Maryborough on the Mildura line. VLocity trains are permitted to run only on lines where all level crossings are protected by boom gates and lights. In 2017 the State Government announced upgrade works to extend VLocity services to Warrnambool, Albury and Bairnsdale, and in 2019 announced upgrades to allow them to run to Shepparton. A VLocity simulator is used by V/Line for driver training. The simulator replicates the driving cabin of the VLocity and includes forward vision and rear mirror graphics and audio effects. An instructor positioned outside the simulator can control track conditions and replicate some faults with the train itself. On 21 June 2020, a 9-car train, consisting of sets VL07, VL63 and VL23, undertook a test run from Southern Cross to Wyndham Vale to test 9-car operation and platform fit.

Kite landboarding, also known as land kiteboarding or flyboarding, is based on the sport of kitesurfing, where a rider on a surf-style board is pulled over water by a kite. Kite landboarding involves the use of a mountain board or landboard, which is essentially an oversized skateboard with large pneumatic wheels and foot-straps. Kite landboarding is a growing sport, and there are several competitions. Kite landboarding is attracting growing publicity although it is not yet as popular or as well known as kitesurfing. Technique Typically, kite landboarding takes place in large open areas where the wind is constant and there are no obstructions such as trees or people. Large hard-packed sandy beaches are typical landboarding locations because of the large space available and wind conditions. The rider starts off by getting the kite into a neutral position overhead. Once strapped onto the board, the rider can orient the kite such that it pulls the rider across the ground. This is done by moving the kite in either direction, generating a pull. As in kitesurfing, competent riders are able to \\"get some air\\" which is essentially maneuvering the kite to pull the rider into the air, possibly several feet up. More competent riders are able to do several moves in the air such as grabs, rotations and flips. Tricks More advanced riders can do a number of tricks that are mainly based on those found in kitesurfing and wakeboarding. These include tricks while the rider is in the air which could involve rotations, flips, grabs, or combinations of these tricks. \\"Board-off\\" moves are tricks where the rider removes the board from his feet in the air and he can spin or flip it before putting it back on his feet and landing. On the ground, tricks include sliding the board, wheelies and riding toeside (riding with your back to the kite). Various tricks have not readily transitioned from kitesurfing due to the harder surface involved. One such trick is the \\"kiteloop\\" which involves looping the kite through the power zone while the kiter is in the air, giving a strong horizontal (and sometimes downwards) pull. In addition to these kitesurfing based tricks, there are also a number of skateboarding style accessories that have become popular such as ramps and grinders. In recent years, specific kite landboarding parks have opened with large areas and ramps and other obstacles available. Equipment The kite is a large sail, usually made of strong ripstop nylon, and is flown on either 2, 3, 4 or 5 lines. Models of kites can have several different sizes within the range - because the stronger the wind is, the smaller the kite used. The kite is controlled via a control bar or a set of handles (kite control systems). There are various types of kites used in kite landboarding. Foil type kites, from manufacturers such as FreakDog, HQ Powerkites, Flexifoil, Ozone Kites, Flysurfer or Best Kiteboarding can be fixed bridle or de-power systems. De-power systems allow the rider to change the kites angle by moving the bar toward or away from them to power or de- power the kite respectively. Most riders prefer de-powerable kites as it is possible to easily adjust the power in case of gusts or an increase in wind speeds. Alternatively \\"arcs\\" are growing in popularity thanks to several kites made by Peter Lynn. There are many different types of boards. Landboards are often made out of wood, although some riders prefer lighter composite boards. Size and width of the board varies. Longer and wider boards are more stable and tend to be for larger riders or beginners while narrower smaller boards are for smaller people or for pulling off more tricks. Many boards also have suspensions which can be adjusted to preference. These can usually be adjusted by adjusting the actual suspension or by inserting a \\"shock egg\\" (an egg shaped rubber shock absorber) into the suspension. The boards also have some similar features to kitesurfing boards, and have similar style bindings to keep the rider's feet locked into place. They allow the board to stay with the rider while airborne but they are also easy to remove in the case of any \\"board-off\\" tricks. Many also have a grab handle in the centre of the board in order to facilitate the removing of the board during a trick. Some riders attach the kite's handle or control bar via a strap to a harness worn by the rider, allowing the rider to remove his hands from the control system in order to do tricks. The use of a harness also allows a rider to ride for a longer time, as much of the force of the kite is taken off the rider's arms. For de- powerable kites, the harness connection is used to power and de-power the kite. There are different types of harnesses (e.g., waist or seat), and selection depends on the personal preference of the rider. Some riders use specially designed snowkiting harnesses that are very similar to those used in rock climbing (or just reuse rock climbing harnesses). Because harnesses keep the rider attached to the kite, a number of safety measures have been developed. These include easily reachable safety systems actuated by pins. The pins allow the rider to release the connection between the rider and the kite when necessary. Some harnesses also have an easily accessible knife to cut the lines if necessary in an emergency. Other commonly used pieces of equipment include a groundstake (in order to hold down the kite when it is landed), a wind meter (to read the exact speed of the wind) as well as various spares, tools and repair tape. In addition various types of safety equipment described below are essential to the sport. Safety concerns Landboard rider in North Mayo, Ireland, wearing helmet and knee pads Due to the power that the kites can generate, riders can hit high speeds and propel themselves several feet in the air. As this is a land-based sport, there have been several concerns about the possibility of injury to the rider or to others. As a result, several safety equipment items are used by riders in this sport. Helmets are essential, especially for the more advanced moves, where a rider may find himself rotating and flipping. Padding, including shoulder and knee pads, can be worn to protect from hard falls. Many kite-flying sites in the UK are introducing measures to only allow riders who have helmets and have valid 3rd party insurance policies. In addition to this, many kite manufacturers have incorporated safety designs in their kites in order to depower the kite in order to stop it dragging the rider after a fall and protecting any other people in the vicinity. These tend to include safety leashes connected to the rider which, when the rider lets go of the kite's control system, will completely depower the kite and bring it gently back to the ground. Before Kite Landboarding, the rider should assess their chosen kitespot for any risks, making sure that they are keeping themselves and other people around them safe. This can be done with the mnemonic SHOE. Surface ‚Äì Is the terrain good for landboarding? Hard sand is a great surface to landboard on. Hazards ‚Äì Are you in a big open space away from downwind hazards? Other People ‚Äì Are you on a quiet beach or field? Give other beach users space and keep them safe. Environment ‚Äì How windy is it? How does the tide affect you? Are you using the correct equipment? History A young boy's 1916 \\"windmobile\\". (Popular Science Monthly, Feb 1916, p170) An early form of the wheeled landboard was invented by children in New York state in 1916 using roller skates, baby carriage wheels, a wooden board and a cloth sail: :With front and rear wheels oiled well, and a brisk breeze blowing, he can travel at a 20 mile-per-hour clip without much difficulty, despite the crude construction of the vehicle.

After playing the violin and recording with many jazz and dance bands, and leading his own London Casino Orchestra, in the 1920s and 1930s, during World War II, Rignold began to conduct classical orchestras. Thereafter, he conducted opera at Covent Garden and then the Liverpool Philharmonic, beginning in the late 1940s, followed by the Royal Ballet and his long tenure with Birmingham. Biography Born in Kingston upon Thames, England, the son of conductor Hugo Charles Rignold and opera singer Agnes Mann, Rignold was taken to Canada when his parents emigrated to Winnipeg in 1910. He began studying the violin as a child with John Waterhouse in Winnipeg and played in the orchestra of the Winnipeg Theatre.\\"Winnipeg Theatre Notes\\", Manitoba Free Press, 19 April 1924, p. 23 After returning to England in 1921, he studied at the Royal Academy of MusicThe Times Obituary, 1 June 1976, p. 14. That he was \\"progressing famously\\" at the Royal Academy, and that he had received notice from The Times, The Daily Telegraph and The Weekly Era was noted in the 1924 Manitoba Free Press article referenced above. and then worked as a blacksmith for a time. =Early career= In the 1920s and 1930s, Rignold played violin with many jazz and dance bands of the day, including those of Mantovani, Jack Hylton, Jack Harris, Fred Hartley, Ambrose, Lew Stone and Jay Wilbur. Rignold was highly regarded as a jazz player. In 1936 The Gramophone magazine said of him, \\"With the possible exception of the Negro artist, Eddie South, and our own Eric Siday, who is abroad, there have been only two violinists who have hitherto meant anything to jazz ‚Äì Venuti, of course, and more recently the French musician Stephane Grappelly (sic). To my mind Hugo Rignold is a greater artist than any of them.\\"The Gramophone, February 1936, p. 384 Rignold went on to lead his own London Casino Orchestra. He made many recordings with these musicians, a good number of which have been reissued on modern CDs. Other classical musicians such as Leon and Sidonie Goossens, did likewise, but these early jazz and dance records caused some snobbish condescension towards Rignold later in his career (as later happened to Andr√© Previn).Mountain, p. 134For example: \\"The conductor [Previn] known better as a jazz pianist and more recently for his musical activities in Hollywood, fulfils his role adequately.\\" Gramophone, June 1965, p. 13 1920s recordings in which Rignold played with the Jack Hylton Orchestra include George Gershwin's \\"Oh, Lady Be Good\\" recorded on 29 March 1926, and Irving Berlin's \\"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\\" recorded on 17 August 1926. Both were for HMV at the company's studios in Hayes, Middlesex. Later, with Hylton as his mentor, he founded and led his own band, which was playing up to the beginning of the Second World War. Rignold married three times: in 1934 to Rita Mary Gaylor (the actress Molly Gay); in 1941 to Phyllis Stanley; and in 1948 to Patricia Horton. There was a daughter by each of the first two marriages.\\"Rignold, Hugo Henry\\", Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920‚Äì2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007.

Retrieved 26 October 2008Baily, Kenneth (ed.) \\"Kiddy-Vision, Once Daily\\" in The Television Annual for 1953 =Post-war= While serving in the Royal Air Force in 1944, Rignold got the chance to conduct the Palestine Orchestra, now the Israel Philharmonic, and thereafter his career remained within the classical sphere. He was a staff conductor at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, 1947‚Äì1948; he directed the Liverpool Philharmonic (not then 'Royal') in the 1940s and 1950s, succeeding the popular Malcolm Sargent. A \\"period of unrest and strife\\" accompanied the beginning of Rignold's reign in Liverpool: Rignold replaced many older players in the orchestra, and some of the audience were unimpressed by his career in popular music. In the 1949/1950 season with the Liverpool Philharmonic, Rignold conducted 34 concerts, with guest conductors, including Sargent, Rafael Kubel√≠k, Zolt√°n Kod√°ly, Sir Adrian Boult and Sir Thomas Beecham conducting a total of 19 other concerts. Rignold's programming there maintained a balance between presenting accepted modern and classical works and premiering new works, including Sergei Prokofiev's suite from Cinderella and works by Bohuslav Martin≈Ø, E. J. Moeran and Gordon Jacob. From 1957 to 1960 Rignold was Musical Director of the Royal Ballet, In 1960 he became permanent conductor of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra when Andrzej Panufnik unexpectedly resigned. He remained at Birmingham until 1968. Rignold made a number of classical recordings, but did not have a long-term contract with any of the record companies, with the consequence that his recorded repertory was somewhat haphazard ‚Äì accompanying concertos, or selections for operatic artists (including Maggie Teyte), and ballet music. Most of his records were made in the mono era, and some have been reissued on CD. He was a car enthusiast and talented driver: it was said that \\"he would not be out of place on the Grand Prix circuit\\".Mountain, p. 96 References Bibliography * External links *Hugo Rignold biography Category:1905 births Category:1976 deaths Category:20th-century British conductors (music) Category:20th-century English musicians Category:Alumni of the Royal Academy of Music Category:English conductors (music) Category:British male conductors (music) Category:20th-century British male musicians ","title":"Hugo Rignold"},{"id":"4887671","text":"The Kartvelian studies () also referred as Kartvelology or Georgian studies is a field of humanities covering Kartvelian (Georgian) history, languages, religion and/or culture.

Emmeram had been a guest of the ducal court for three years, where he was known for his chaste and pure lifestyle. Uta, daughter of Duke Theodo and sister to Lantpert, had become pregnant by her lover. Fearing her father's wrath, she confided to Emmeram and the saint promised bear the blame, as he was about to travel to Rome.

List mining raises novel issues in Internet research ethics. These ethical issues are especially important for health related lists. Some questions that need to be considered by a Research Ethics Committee (or an Institutional Review Board) when reviewing research proposals that involve list mining include these: Are participants in mailing lists \\"research subjects\\"? Should those participants in a health related electronic mailing list who were the original sources of messages sent to such lists be regarded as \\"research subjects\\"? If so, then several ethical issues need to be considered. These include those pertaining to privacy, informed consent, whether the research is intrusive and has potential for harm, and whether the list should be perceived as \\"private\\" or \\"public\\" space. Are participants in mailing lists \\"published authors\\"? Should those who were the sources of messages sent to such lists be regarded as \\"published authors\\"? Or, perhaps, as \\"amateur authors\\"? If so, there are issues of copyright and proper attribution to be considered if messages sent to such lists are cited verbatim. Even short excerpts from such messages raise such issues. Are participants in mailing lists \\"members of a community\\"? Participants on mailing lists such as electronic support groups may regard themselves as members of an online \\"community\\". Are they? To provide an answer to this question, characteristics of various types of communities need to be defined and considered. For example, if one defining characteristic of a community is \\"self-identification as community\\", then virtual groups often have this characteristic. However, if \\"geographic localization\\" or \\"legitimate political authority\\" are considered to be other defining characteristics of a community, then virtual groups rarely or never possess this characteristic. Of particular importance are virtual groups that, instead of being supportive, may endanger public health in some way. Examples would be mailing lists that attempt to promote actions that may be illegal (such as inciting race hatred), or actions that may be unpopular, but not currently illegal (such as promoting the sale of cigarettes to adults). From a perspective of Internet research ethics, judgements about the potential of particular mailing lists to cause more harms than benefits should be made by a Research Ethics Committee (or an Institutional Review Board), rather than by the researchers themselves.

Postol (born 1946) is a professor emeritus of Science, Technology, and International Security at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Prior to his work at MIT, he worked at Argonne National Laboratory, the Pentagon, and Stanford University. He also criticized the government's analysis of the 2013 Ghouta chemical attack in Syria, analysis by the US and other western governments of the April 4, 2017 Khan Shaykhun chemical attack, and has accused the OPCW of \\"deception\\" concerning the Douma chemical attack. Earlier, he was a critic of U.S. government statements about the reported success rates of Patriot missiles during the first Gulf War, also known as Operation Desert Storm. Background He received his undergraduate degree in physics and his PhD in nuclear engineering from MIT. Postol worked at Argonne National Laboratory, where he studied the microscopic dynamics and structure of liquids and disordered solids using neutron, X-ray and light scattering techniques, along with molecular dynamics simulations. He also worked at the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, where he studied methods of basing the MX missile, and later worked as a scientific adviser to the Chief of Naval Operations. After leaving the Pentagon, Postol helped to build a program at Stanford University to train mid-career scientists to study weapons technology in relation to defense and arms control policy. In 1990, Postol received the Leo Szilard Prize from the American Physical Society for \\"incisive technical analysis of national security issues that [have] been vital for informing the public policy debate.\\"; in 1995, he received the Hilliard Roderick Prize from the American Association for the Advancement of Science and in 2001, he received the Norbert Wiener Award from Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility for \\"uncovering numerous and important false claims about missile defenses.\\". On September 28, 2016 the Federation of American Scientists awarded Professor Theodore Postol from MIT their annual Richard L. Garwin Award, \\"that recognizes an individual who, through exceptional achievement in science and technology, has made an outstanding contribution toward the benefit of mankind.\\" Patriot missiles in Operation Desert Storm The Patriot Missile was used in the first Gulf War (Operation Desert Storm) to intercept descent-phase SCUD missiles fired by Iraq. The U.S. Army claimed a success rate of 80% in Saudi Arabia and 50% in Israel, claims that were later reduced to 70% and 40%. But President George H.W. Bush claimed a success rate of more than 97% during a speech at Raytheon's Patriot manufacturing plant in Andover, Massachusetts in February 1991, declaring, the \\"Patriot is 41 for 42: 42 Scuds engaged, 41 intercepted!\\" In April 1992, Postol told a House committee that \\"the Patriot's intercept rate during the Gulf War was very low. The evidence from these preliminary studies indicates that Patriot's intercept rate could be much lower than 10 percent, possibly even zero.\\" Postol later criticized the Army's \\"independent\\" Analysis of Video Tapes to Assess Patriot Effectiveness as being \\"seriously compromised\\" by the \\"selective\\" and \\"arbitrary\\" use of data. A House Government Operations Committee investigation in 1992 concluded that, contrary to military claims on effectiveness, Patriot missiles destroyed only 9 percent of SCUD missiles during attempts at interception. National ballistic missile defense In 1996, Nira Schwartz, a senior engineer at defense contractor TRW blew the whistle on TRW for exaggerating the capabilities of an antiballistic missile sensor. The sensor was subsequently used in a \\"successful\\" missile test in 1997. The then- Ballistic Missile Defense Organization launched an investigation in 1998 and asked a Pentagon advisory board called POET (Phase One Engineering Team), which included two staff members from MIT's Lincoln Laboratory, to review performance of TRW software, using data from the 1997 flight test. These engineers concluded in their report that Schwartz's allegations were untrue and despite failure of the sensor, the software \\"basically worked the way TRW said it worked.\\" In December 1998, TRW's contract was not extended by the government, which chose a competing system built by Raytheon. In 2000, Schwartz gave Postol an unclassified version of the POET report from which sensitive text and graphs had been removed. Based on this redacted report, he notified the White House and senior MIT officials of possible fraud and research misconduct at TRW and MIT Lincoln Laboratory. The Pentagon responded by classifying the letter and dispatching Defense Security Service members to his office. Three agents of the Defense Security Services arrived unannounced to his campus office and attempted to show him other classified documents, but Postol refused to look at them. If he had read them, he would not have been able to criticize the antimissile system without putting his security clearance at risk. Postol claimed the visit was meant to silence him, which was denied by the Defense Security Services. =Investigation into TRW/MIT Lincoln Laboratory report= Postol demanded the MIT administration under President Charles Vest and Provost Robert Brown investigate possible violations to MIT policies on research misconduct. The administration initially resisted, but later appointed another faculty member to conduct a preliminary investigation. In 2002, this professor's investigation found no evidence of a credible error, but he subsequently recommended a full investigation when Postol provided a statement of additional concerns. A subsequent 18-month investigation by the General Accounting Office in 2002 found widespread technical failures in the anti-missile system, contradicting the original report in 1997. In May 2006, a panel composed of MIT faculty members concluded that the investigator recommended a full investigation \\"because of his inability to exhaust all the questions that arose during the inquiry,\\" not because it appeared likely misconduct had occurred, and that a full investigation had not been warranted. Under National Science Foundation regulations governing research misconduct, a preliminary inquiry should be completed within 90 days of an allegation, and a full investigation within 180 days subject to penalties as severe as suspension of federal funding. By December 2004, four years later, no formal investigation had been performed, and the Missile Defense Agency formally rejected MIT's request to investigate the classified data. Postol asserts that the MIT administration has been compliant with the Pentagon's attempts to cover up a fiasco by dragging its feet on an investigation because defense contracts through Lincoln Laboratory constitute a major portion of MIT's operating budget. In early 2006, a compromise was reached whereby MIT would halt any attempt to conduct its own investigation and senior Air Force administrator Brendan B. Godfrey and former Lockheed Martin chief executive Norman R. Augustine would lead a final investigation. Postol disputes the impartiality of this new investigation as Augustine was CEO while Lockheed was a contractor with NBMD. In May 2006, an MIT Ad-Hoc Committee on Research Misconduct Allegation concluded delays in the investigation were caused by a number of factors, including: \\"initial uncertainty about the applicability of MIT's research misconduct policy to a government [non-MIT] report\\"; government classification of relevant information, possibly in an attempt to make it unavailable to plaintiffs in the TRW whistle-blower trial; and Postol's failure to provide a clearly written summary of his allegations, which changed repeatedly during the investigation. The committee also found that Postol repeatedly violated MIT confidentiality rules \\"causing personal distress to the Lincoln Laboratory researchers, their families and colleagues\\". =SM-3 interceptor= In September 2009, President Barack Obama announced that his administration was scrapping the Bush administration's proposed anti-ballistic missile shield in Europe and replacing it with reconfigured SM-3 missiles. A \\"Ballistic Missile Defense Review\\" was completed in March 2010 concluding that existing ballistic missile defense technologies provided a reliable and robust defense against limited ICBM attacks. In May 2010, Postol and George N. Lewis published an analysis concluding that the majority of SM-3 interceptor tests classified as \\"successful\\" actually failed to destroy incoming warheads. The Missile Defense Agency challenged the New York Times article, claiming that the SM-3 program is one of the most successful programs within the Department of Defense and that the New York Times chose not to publish information supplied by the MDA in response to the allegations made by Postol and Lewis. Iron Dome In July 2014, Postol was quoted in the MIT Technology Review criticising the effectiveness of the Israeli Iron Dome antimissile system. The article received so many negative comments that the website invited Postol to present his evidence. His response, in August, was based on photographic evidence of the system in operation.  Syria  With Richard Lloyd, an expert in warhead design at the military contractor Tesla Laboratories, Postol wrote about the 2013 Ghouta chemical attack.The Kardashian Look-Alike Trolling for Assad 10.17.14 The Daily Beast, Noah Shachtman Michael Kennedy Analysing YouTube footage of the attacks and its aftermath, the two men believed they found a number of items to be inconsistent with the US government's claims about the incident.

Based on his own analysis of the photographic evidence, Postol argued that the chemical attack was not an air raid, but conducted from the ground using most probably an emptied 122mm artillery rocket tube, which is normally used as munition of a multiple rocket launcher, filling it with a chemical agent and detonating it by an explosive charge laid on top of it. On 18 April, Postol published an analysis based on the publicly available photo evidence, that the crater presented in the evidence,could not have been the source of the necessary sarin smoke plume, as persons were seen in the video material live at the site, without appropriate protection gear. A sarin smoke plume would have killed them even hours after a sarin gas grenade explosion.T Postol The Nerve Agent Attack that Did Not Occur: Analysis of the Times and Locations of Critical Events in the Alleged Nerve Agent Attack at 7 AM on April 4, 2017 in Khan Sheikhoun, SyriaMuhammad Idrees Ahmad Chomsky and the Syria revisionists: Regime whitewashing, Al-Araby, 5 May 2017 On 21 April, he corrected this view in one aspect: \\"In my earlier report released on April 18, 2017 I misinterpreted the wind-direction convention which resulted in my estimates of plume directions being exactly 180¬∞ off in direction\\", which was however irrelevant for his main statement, that no sarin could have been emitted at the crater-site.T. Postol IMPORTANT CORRECTION TO The Nerve Agent Attack that Did Not Occur, 23 April 2017 Later in April, Postol claimed that the \\"French Intelligence Report of April 26, 2017 directly contradicts the White House Intelligence Report of 11 April 2017\\".T Postol The French Intelligence Report of April 26, 2017 Contradicts the Allegations in the White House Intelligence Report of April 11, 2017, 27 April 2017 The following day he revised his view, saying he had confused the date and location for a different chemical attack four years earlier.http://turcopolier.typepad.com/sic_semper_tyrannis/2017/04/correction- to-the-french-intelligence-report-of-april-26-2017-contradicts-the- allegations-in-the-whi.html Postol argued that none of the forensic evidence in The New York Times video and a follow-on Times news article on the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack supports the conclusions reported by The New York Times. In 2019, the Princeton based journal Science & Global Security, on whose editorial board Ted Postol sat,al-bab.com Brian Whitaker, postol resigns intended to publish a report titled \\"Computational Forensic Analysis for the Chemical Weapons Attack at Khan Sheikhoun on 4 April 2017\\" about the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack written by Postol with Goong Chen, Cong Gu, Alexey Sergeev, Sanyang Liu, Pengfei Yao and Marlan O. Scully. The report questioned the findings of the OPCW investigation which concluded that the Assad regime had used sarin. The report's interpretation were, however, dismissed by the website Bellingcat, who stated there were many caveats in its analysis. According to Bellingcat the report's use of simulation was methodologically flawed, as the paper only provided a simulation of a 122mm type rocket, and did not attempt to study other possible options. In response to the Bellingcat article, the editors of Science & Global Security said \\"Regrettably, the Bellingcat group blog post contains a number of incorrect statements about the contents and conclusions of the paper to be published. Some of the statements appear to refer to an earlier manuscript and do not take account of all the changes made during the peer review and editorial process managed by this journal\\". The journal later decided not to publish the paper after it \\"identified a number of issues with the peer-review and revision process\\". DPRK In August 2017, Postol shared with Newsweek a paper he co-authored with Markus Schiller and Robert Schmucker of Schmucker Technologies claiming that missiles tested earlier in 2017 by the DPRK that had been widely described as intercontinental ballistic missiles were in reality incapable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the mainland United States.

Its founder and ideological inspiration was Francis Parker Yockey. Other leading members of the ELF included the former Manchester UM Organiser John Anthony Gannon, Guy Chesham, Peter Huxley-Blythe and Anthony F.X. Barron. In 1949 they issued a manifesto titled The Proclamation of London, written by Yockey.http://home.alphalink.com.au/~radnat/fpyockey/proclamation.html The pan-nationalist (Pan-Europeanist) and anti-American movement had little impact, with only a total membership of 150 card-carrying members at its peak, and the ELF only lasted until 1954.  Legacy  In the 1990s, the ELF, Yockey, and his ideology, were rediscovered by the Nouvelle R√©sistance, Alternativa Europea, National-Bolshevik Party, National Revolutionary Faction, and others. In 1999, a manifesto of a second 'European Liberation Front' was published in Paris, but there is apparently no more active organisation of that name now. The manifesto takes its ideological inspiration from Yockey, and from Otto Strasser, who was expelled from the Nazi Party by Adolf Hitler in 1930. Despite the pan-European style of its title, the ideology of the manifesto is ethnic and racial nationalism: the manifesto speaks of the \\"historical and cultural ties which exist between our respective nations\\" and calls for \\"mono-ethnic racial homelands\\" to preserve the \\"race, culture and traditions of all European peoples\\". European liberation, according to the manifesto, consists of \\"National Revolution\\". During the 21st century, Arktos Media, Counter-Currents, Greg Johnson and the New Zealand-based New Right author Kerry Bolton have promoted a revival of interest in the ELF, and its leading figure and ideologue Francis Parker Yockey.

Vice President Hal Gardner authorizes her to absorb and essentially replace the workers at CTU - Los Angeles after a major terrorist attack leaves many of CTU's original employees dead. Hayes takes operational control of CTU. She decides to keep the survivors on staff until the crisis is over, against the advice of her assistant Miles Papazian. After the nerve gas is secured, Hayes vouches for CTU, but is ordered by the Vice President to fire them and fully absorb CTU into Homeland. She gradually grows suspicious of her superiors when President Charles Logan issues an executive order for the detainment and arrest of Jack Bauer and later says that he will use the military to capture him. After one of her people from Homeland indirectly aids Jack Bauer, she learns from Mike Novick that Logan never contacted the military about Bauer and that no member of the executive office has yet seen Logan's \\"evidence\\" against Bauer. Based on the President's actions in the preceding hours, Hayes is convinced that Logan is indeed manipulating CTU in order to kill Bauer. After Jack successfully obtains a confession from Logan, Hayes prepares to leave CTU for the day, under new orders to report to Washington, D.C. to fully report on the day's events. She acknowledges to Buchanan that she will strongly recommend to newly appointed President Gardner that he remain as Special Agent in Charge of CTU.

The village is situated approximately north-west of Hull city centre, north of South Cave and south of Market Weighton. It lies to the east of the A1034 road. History In 1823 North Newbald was a village and civil parish in the Wapentake of Harthill and the Liberty of St Peter's. The North Newbald civil parish contained the hamlet of South Newbald. A stretch of land was purchased to provide a rental which was \\"distributed every New Year's Day to 20 resident parishioners, who have never received parochial relief\\". Population at the time was 543, with occupations including six farmers, two blacksmiths, two bricklayers, two shopkeepers, and a tailor, and the public house landlords of The Tiger; The New Inn, who was also a butcher; and The Rose & Crown, who was also a corn miller. Resident in the village were fourteen yeomen, and the schoolmaster who was a collector of taxes. A carrier operated between the village and Hull twice a week, and Market Weighton and Beverley once a week. Governance North Newbald along with the hamlet of South Newbald forms the civil parish of Newbald. The village was in the Haltemprice and Howden parliamentary constituency until the 2010 general election when it was transferred to the constituency of Beverley and Holderness. Community North Newbald is a village consisting of about 800 people of all ages. The village has two public houses, The Tiger and The Gnu (originally the New Inn when owned by The Hull Brewery Company), situated across the road from each other, privately run businesses and a number of farms. The main occupations in Newbald involve farming, eggs, warehousing and transport. It has been a carting village for some centuries. Located on the communal village green is the whipping post used in the last public flogging carried out in Britain. St Nicholas' Church, North Newbald The parish church of St Nicholas was designated a Grade I listed building in 1968 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. Built about 1140, it has been described as the \\"finest Norman church in East Yorkshire\\". It has a cruciform plan without aisles and with a tall central tower. Three Norman doorways make the building rare. Pevsner describes the church as the most complete Norman church in the East Riding. The church has a Coronation Clock which was installed at the coronation of George V in 1911. A previous vicar of Newbald, Rev Jack Walker, during his incumbency mapped the whole area and produced detailed drawings suggesting that the village may have been walled. Apart from Rev Walker's submissions there is no further evidence of this. The Yorkshire Wolds Way National Trail, a long distance footpath passes to the east of the village. Buses run about three times a week to Beverley. Three local sporting teams play at the village playing fields: Newbald Utd, Newbald A.F.C., and Newbald North End F.C.

Its run was preceded by three years of local broadcast on WLWD in Dayton, Ohio, and it was broadcast nationwide between 1970 and 1996. In 2002, Donahue was ranked 29th on TV Guide magazine's list of the 50 greatest television shows of all-time. History In 1967, Phil Donahue left his positions as news reporter and interviewer at WHIO radio and television in Dayton to go into sales. He found he did not like it and took a position as newsman at another Dayton station WLWD (now WDTN). When the station‚Äôs Johnny Gilbert Show ended, the station kept the studio audience and Donahue became the creator and host of a new television program, Phil Donahue Show on WLWD (now WDTN), also in Dayton. His new program replaced The Johnny Gilbert Show, when Gilbert left on short notice for Los Angeles for a hosting job. On November 6, 1967, Donahue hosted his first guest, atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair.Handbook of Texas Online: Madalyn Murray O'Hair (Note: this article mentioned that Donahue's show started in 1963, with Madalyn as guest.) Though he would later call her message of atheism \\"very important\\", he also stated she was rather unpleasant and that, off-camera, she mocked him for being Catholic. Initially, the program was shown only on other stations owned by the Crosley Broadcasting Corporation (which would later take the name of its parent Avco Company), which also owned WLWD. But, on September 14, 1970, The Donahue Show entered nationwide syndication. Donahue relocated the show's home base to Chicago in 1974, first housing it at then-independent station WGN-TV. Around this time the show's popularity increased, and in the process it became a national phenomenon. When the Avco Company divested their broadcasting properties in 1976, Multimedia Inc. assumed production and syndication of the program, which was now known as simply Donahue. In 1982, Donahue moved the show to CBS-owned WBBM-TV for its final years based in Chicago and the Midwest. In 1984, Donahue introduced many viewers to hip-hop culture, as a program featured breakdancing for the first time on national television, accompanied by a performance from the hip hop group UTFO. In 1985, Donahue left Chicago for New York City and began recording in Studio 8-G at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, the home of his New York affiliate WNBC-TV. Prior to the move, a month-long series of commercials heralded the move, and NBC's late-night talk host David Letterman would use portions of his national program counting down the days to Donahue's move with a huge calendar in his studio. One of the most talked-about incidents in Donahues history came on January 21, 1985, soon after the show moved to New York. On this day's program, seven members of the audience appeared to faint during the broadcast, which was seen live in New York. Donahue, fearing the fainting was caused by both anxiety at being on television and an overheated studio, eventually cleared the studio of audience members and then resumed the show. It turned out the fainting \\"spell\\" was cooked up by media hoaxer Alan Abel in what Abel said was a protest against what he termed as poor-quality television. In 1992, Donahue celebrated the 25th anniversary of his long- running television program with an NBC special produced at the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York, in which he was lauded by his talk-show peers. However, in many corners, he was seen as having been bypassed both by Oprah Winfrey, whose hugely successful national show was based in Donahue's former Chicago home base; and Sally Jessy Raphael, whose talk show was distributed by Donahue's syndicator, Multimedia. =The end of Donahue= The talk show field became increasingly saturated as the 1990s progressed. Many of these shows took an increasingly tabloid bent. Donahue shied away from this trend, continuing to take a \\"high-road\\" approach. These factors led to a marked decline in ratings. The show also lost support after Donahue expressed his feelings regarding the first Gulf War. In the fall of 1995, ABC-owned KGO-TV in San Francisco dropped Donahue after carrying it for several years. Weeks later, New York's WNBC-TV also canceled it after airing it since 1977.Ny Station Removes ‚ÄòDonahue‚Äô; August 18, 1995; The Spokesman-Review Donahue was also evicted from its Rockefeller Plaza home, and relocated to new studios in Manhattan. Donahue was unable to find new outlets in the nation's largest and eighth-largest markets, and its ratings never recovered. Most stations either began dropping Donahue or moving it to late-night and early-morning time slots, causing a further loss of viewers. After 29 years (26 of which in syndication) and nearly 7,000 shows, the final episode aired on September 13, 1996, culminating in what continues to be the longest continuous run of any syndicated talk show in U.S. television history. =International success= Donahue was also broadcast in the UK on the ITV Night Time line up in the late 1980s and early '90s, where it became cult viewing. After its success, Donahue made several shows in Britain featuring some well-known celebrities from the country as guests, recorded mostly in London but notably one programme recorded in Manchester, which had several members of the cast from the American sitcom Cheers and the Manchester-based soap opera Coronation Street. Thames Television also broadcast a number of episodes during daytime for the London area only.

The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) has 166,000 members, who are audiologists, speech-language pathologists, speech, language, and hearing scientists, and speech language pathology assistants. To begin practice in most areas of the United States, a prospective therapist must have an undergraduate degree (preferably in some area of communications) and a graduate degree (with two externships; usually about 2 to 2 1/2 years) in speech pathology. A 9-month, supervised clinical fellowship year is then completed, after which the Certificate of Clinical Competence (CCC) in speech pathology from the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) is granted. In order to be certified clinically competent the Praxis exam must be passed. In some areas the master's degree is not required. In some areas additional requirements must be met: an additional certification from ASHA in school speech pathology and audiology, certification in special education instruction, and/or and must have passed any other federal or state examinations for licensure and certification. To retain the ASHA license a minimum amount of continuing education must be completed. A doctorate is not currently required (as of June 2011), but that may change, as it has for many other areas of therapy. Speech-language pathology overlaps with many educational disciplines, such as communication sciences, linguistics, special education, and health care. This article will explore some of the fundamental elements of speech-language pathology, looking at the career in an educational setting. Speech and language pathology Speech-Language Pathologists (SLP) are professionals who assess and diagnose individuals with speech, language, cognitive, and swallowing disorders. SLPs are informally referred to as speech therapists. SLPs may also conduct research in the field, run a private practice, or work with large companies to improve employee-customer communication (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association). This article will focus on the aspects of speech-language pathology as practiced with young children in a school setting. For most people, the terms speech, language, and communication have nearly the same definition. However, in the realm of speech-language pathology, there are important distinctions to be made. Speech is the spoken production of language and the process through which sounds are produced. Several parts of the body work together to produce sound waves, and this motor production of speech is called articulation. The parts of the vocal tract involved with speech include the lips, tongue, teeth, throat, vocal folds, and lungs. Speech disorders affect the physical mechanisms of communication and cause problems with articulation or phonology. Examples of speech disorders include stuttering, lisping, and voice disorders. Language is a system used to represent thoughts and ideas. Language is made up of several rules that explain what words mean, how to make new words, and how to put words together to form sentences. A community must share the same language in order to attach meaning to utterances. The method of delivery of language may be visual (e.g., American Sign Language), auditory (e.g., English), and/or written. Humans are the only creatures innately capable of using language to discuss an endless number of topics. Language disorders can be developmental or acquired (e.g., specific language impairment and aphasia, respectively). Communication is the exchange of information and ideas through the use of speech and language. The transfer of information is often spoken, but may also be implied through body language or contextual cues such as intonation or hesitation. Usually, communication is a four-step process: # Encoding: the speaker creates the message in his mind # Transmittal: the speaker sends the message # Reception: the listener receives the message # Decoding: the listener breaks down the message in his mind If a problem occurs at any step of the process, the message might not be communicated. Without the ability to communicate through speech and language, we would not be able to tell a doctor that we have a stomach ache, choose food from a menu, or say \\"I love you\\" to our children. Communication is a most basic component of human nature and it develops before we are even conscious of it. PHAGIA & SWALLOWING The process of grasping, biting, sucking, mucose making, swallowing and routine eating ability. Dysphagia can effect in many aspect of life. Dysphagia accurs in developments disorder and acquired brain and buccofacial anomalies or disease. Speech and Language Pathology Jobs Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) have several options when seeking employment. One of the most popular is to secure a school-based position through an agency that specializes in this area. One of the largest and most respected agencies is Therapy Source, a nationwide organization founded in 2001, and based out of Plymouth Meeting, PA. Development of speech and language Every child develops at a different rate, but most go through the same stages. Listed below are the average ages of some important language and comprehension milestones as developed by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association. Please note that like with any developmental timeline, these stages may be quite varied and perhaps met in a different order. A child who accomplishes these milestones differently may not necessarily have a developmental delay or speech disorder (and a child who hits these stages early is not necessarily a prodigy!). * birth to 3 months ** startles to loud sounds ** smiles when spoken to ** responds to pleasure with 'cooing' noises * 4 months to 6 months ** notices and pays attention to sounds and music ** shifts eyes in direction of sounds ** makes babbling noises that resemble speech * 7 months to 1 year ** recognizes basic familiar words such as cup or ball ** imitates different speech sounds ** produces first words such as bye-bye or mama * 1 year to 2 years ** listens to simple stories ** identifies pictures by name when directed (point to the cow, e.g.) ** speaks two-word sentences such as more juice or where daddy? * 2 years to 3 years ** understands differences in meaning for basic words (up-down or in-out) ** produces three-word sentences ** can name most objects * 3 years to 4 years ** understands questions ** talks about events ** speech is understood by most people * 4 years to 5 years ** pays attention and responds to stories and questions ** speaks clearly ** tells detailed, ordered stories Problems can arise at any stage of development, as well as much later in life. They can be the result of a congenital defect, a developmental disorder, or an injury. If a problem is suspected, an assessment should be made by an SLP who can diagnose and treat communication disorders. Diagnosis of communication disorders In a school setting, children are often screened when they start kindergarten. This process involves a rapid assessment to determine which children need further testing, diagnosis, or treatment. Often, a screening is a sort of informal interview between an SLP and a child or group of children. The child may be asked to give their name, count, pronounce the names of pictured objects, and answer open-ended questions. The purpose of these tasks is to elicit a brief language sample from the child which the SLP will use to evaluate articulation, fluency, and other aspects of speech. Screenings usually last about five minutes (Oyer 10). After a screening is done, an individual diagnosis must be made. This involves a one-on-one evaluation which may last two hours or more. If an individual has been referred for testing, either by a doctor, teacher, or other professional, the screening process is skipped and testing starts here. This session allows the SLP to gather information that will help in the diagnosis of a speech or language problem, as well as provide insight to possible causes, goals and objectives for therapy, and which techniques will work best for that individual. Individual evaluations often include the following components: * A visual examination of the oral cavity and throat (typically with a flashlight and tongue depressor) to determine whether the physical structures appear to be capable of speech production * Tests of articulation of speech sounds in words and sentences as well as alone * A measure of the ability to hear the difference between correct speech sounds and sounds actually produced * Tests of expressive language and spontaneous speech * Evaluations of fluency and voice * A hearing test * A case history After this evaluation, the SLP will review the results and information gathered and determine whether the individual would benefit from speech therapy. Goals and objectives of therapy are outlined and a specific treatment plan is created, drawing on the strengths and weaknesses and unique situation of that individual (Oyer 11). Common communication and language disorders Disorders that affect children may affect adults differently, or even not at all. As the body grows and develops, the types of disorders that affect an individual change. Children typically exhibit developmental language disorders, but may also experience problems due to illness or injury. In developing children, language disorders are often related to congenital disabilities or neurological or physiological results of childhood illness. These seemingly unrelated problems can seriously affect speech and language development. Children that have cognitive impairments are often delayed in development of communication skills. Different genetic syndromes that often cause cognitive impairment, such as Down syndrome or Williams syndrome, often affect different areas of speech. Children with autism tend to have difficulty communicating and expressing their emotions or desires. Sometimes this is due to specific problems with articulation or semantics, but often it is an issue of neurological development directly related to autism. Brain injuries, tumors, or seizures in children can also cause loss of language skills. Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) commonly have learning difficulties which also affect their language development. Emotional disturbances early in childhood can also affect the growth of basic communicative skills. Perhaps more obvious are the developmental and communicative consequences of childhood hearing loss (Boone 200-05). Some disorders commonly diagnosed in children: =Specific language impairment/ Developmental Language Disorder (#DevLangDis)= Some children have language development deficits that cannot be linked to neurological, intellectual, social, or motor causes. The child's language skills grow much more slowly than those of typically developing children. While other children are speaking in complete sentences, using conjugated verb forms, the SLI child's speech sounds telegraphic- lacking grammatical and functional morphemes (e.g., He go store. rather than He goes to the store.) Their vocabulary remains relatively small while other children are adding new words every day. The SLI child often produces short sentences in order to avoid embarrassment and may have problems understanding complex or figurative structures (such as metaphors or multi-clausal sentences). Problems due to SLI can also lead to learning disabilities as the child fails to understand information being presented in science, language arts, or math classes. Studies suggest that the cause of SLI is a biological difference in brain anatomy and development (Boone 204). Treatment objectives generally focus on vocabulary development, verb morphology, memory and recall, and narrative skills (Goffman 154). =Articulation disorders= An articulation disorder may be diagnosed when a child has difficulty producing phonemes, or speech sounds, correctly. When classifying a sound, speech pathologists refer to the manner of articulation, the place of articulation, and voicing. A speech sound disorder may include one or more errors of place, manner, or voicing of the phoneme. Different types of articulation disorders include: ; omissions : certain sounds are deleted, often at the ends of words; entire syllables or classes of sounds may be deleted; e.g., fi' for fish ; substitutions : one sound is substituted for another, often with similar places or manners or articulation; e.g., ' for fish ; distortions : sounds are changed slightly by what may seem like the addition of noise, or a change in voicing; e.g., filsh for fish ; additions : an extra sound is added to one already produced correctly; often occurs at the ends of words; may include changes in voicing; e.g., fisha for fish (Boone 256-58) The phonemes that present the greatest challenge for children include /l/ as in pull, /r/ as in mirror, / É/ (\\"sh\\") as in shut, /t É/ (\\"ch\\") as in church, /d í/ (\\"j\\") as in fudge, /z/ as in zoo, / í/ (\\"zh\\") as in measure, /Œ∏/ (\\"th\\") as in math and /√∞/ (\\"th\\") as in this (Boone 112). Articulation disorders may be attributed to a variety of causes. A child with hearing loss may not be able to hear certain phonemes pronounced at certain frequencies, or hear the error in their own production of sounds. Oral-motor problems may also be at fault, such as developmental verbal dyspraxia (a problem with coordination of speech muscles) or dysarthria (abnormal facial muscle tone, often due to neurological problems such as cerebral palsy). Abnormalities in the structure of the mouth and other speech muscles can cause problems with articulation; cleft palate, tongue thrust, and dental-orthodontia abnormalities are some common examples. Finally, it is difficult for children to hear and produce all of the different phonemes of a given language. Development is slow, and may take up to seven years. Sometimes, as children grow, articulation problems fade and disappear without treatment. Often, however, therapy is necessary. Treatment therapies may target semantic differences related to phonemic differences (e.g., teaching a child the difference between toe and toad, underlining the importance of the final consonant), physical-motor differences (e.g., using a mirror to show a child the correct tongue placement for a particular sound), or behavior- modification techniques (e.g., repetitive production through prompts and fun learning games). Support and reinforcement of therapy practices, both in the classroom and at home, are crucial to the success of articulation disorder treatment (Boone 122-24, 259‚Äì62, 274‚Äì76). It is necessary to note the difference between articulation disorders and dialectical variations. There are several dialects of English spoken in the United States, influenced by socioeconomic status, geographic isolation, and other languages either brought to the U.S. by settlers or indigenous languages of the Native Americans. These social dialects are rule-governed and are not to be considered lesser than, but simply different from standard English. Examples of dialectical features that may be mistaken for articulation disorders include the 'r-lessness' of New York City speech in words like floor, here, and paper as well as the reduction of consonant clusters in African-American Vernacular English (AAVE). If a word ends with two or more consonants such as in cold, and is followed by another word that begins with a consonant such as cuts, cold is shortened to col, producing col cuts. These features alone should not be treated as articulation disorders to be 'cured' by speech therapy. However, it is possible for a child with a dialectal variation to also have a communication disorder. It is important for a speech pathologist to be able to tell the difference (Oyer 170). =Voice disorders= Children may experience problems with their voice due to misuse or abnormalities in the vocal mechanisms. There are two types of voice disorders: those of phonation, and those of resonance. Both types can be the result of either abuse or physical structure. Voice disorders are among the most successfully treated speech and language problems because they can be solved with surgery or reconditioning of the voice (Boone 286). A phonation disorder is a problem with pitch, loudness, or intensity that originates in the vocal folds of the larynx. Phonation disorders may be functional, caused by continuous yelling or throat clearing, excessive smoking, or speaking at an abnormally low frequency or pitch. The results may be an increased size or thickening of the vocal folds, lesions or polyps on the vocal folds, or problems with elasticity of the larynx. In these cases, the treatment involves resting the voice and learning to speak at optimal pitches and volumes, as well as eliminating external causes such as smoking. Phonation disorders may also be organic, due to viral growths, cancer, paralysis of laryngeal nerves, surgical intubation, or external traumas such as being hit in the throat with a baseball. These problems may require surgical removal of growths or reconstruction of the larynx, accompanied by voice therapy (Boone 287-96). A resonance disorder occurs when any part of the vocal tract is altered or dysfunctional. In the case of an oral resonance disorder, the tongue sits too high in the front or back of the mouth. When the tongue is too far forward in the mouth, a type of 'baby voice' occurs, and a lisp may also result. Treatment involves practicing back vowels such as /a/ in father, /o/ in boat, and /u/ in spoon, accompanied by back consonants like /k/ in broke and /g/ in bog. When the tongue sits toward the back of the mouth, the voice sounds dull, and problems with articulation at the front of the mouth may also occur. Treatment focuses on front consonants such as /w/ in where or work, /p/ in pink, /b/ in ball, /f/ in laugh, /v/ in leave, /l/ in mail, and /th/ in with or bath coupled with high-front vowels like /i/ in wheat, /I/ in fit, /e/ in pay, /E/ in bet, and /ae/ in slat. This type of resonance disorder is commonly seen in children with severe hearing impairment. Nasal resonance disorders occur when the space between the oral and nasal cavities remains open or closed, producing a hypernasal or denasal resonance. Causes of hypernasality include paralysis of the velum, a short velum, or a cleft palate which allows air to escape to the nasal cavity. The speech of actor James Stewart is a recognizable example of hypernasality (although in this case, there was no structural problem; rather, he employed the highly nasal voice as part of his character). Denasality is often caused by a structural blockage which doesn't allow air to pass between the oral and nasal cavities. A child experiencing denasality may sound like they have a bad cold. If a structural problem is to blame, surgery is the most common treatment. After surgery, or if there is no structural cause, voice therapy is often given, involving massive amounts of practice (Boone 305-12). =Fluency disorders= As a child's language and vocabulary grows, they may struggle to locate a particular word or sound. Normal dysfluency occurs in developing children as a repetition of whole words or phrases while the child searches for a particular thought or word. Around age three-and-a-half, children may compulsively repeat words or phrases. This tends to fade by the time the child is five. Stuttering, in contrast, results in repeated or prolonged speech sounds or syllables. Often, involuntary blocks in fluency will be accompanied by muscle tension due to frustration. The mouth may tighten up or the eyes may blink rapidly. A child may become so embarrassed by stuttering that they talk as little as possible to avoid the struggle. This may have serious academic and social implications. The cause of stuttering is unknown, yet widely debated. Most theories suggest emotional, psychological, or neurological origins. Psychological treatment aims at improving the self-image of the child and the child's attitude toward the problem, while other therapies attempt to increase fluency by modifying the rhythm and rate of speech (Boone 316-29, 335‚Äì38). How many people are affected by communication disorders? According to the National Institutes of Health, it is estimated that, in the United States, * between 8 and 10 percent of people have a communication disorder * 7.5 million people have voice disorders * cleft palate affects 1 in 700 live births * 5 percent of children have noticeable communication disorders * stuttering affects more than 3 million people, mostly children age 2 through 6 According to the United States Department of Education, speech, language, and hearing impairments account for 20.1 percent of all Special Education students in the United States. Benefits of speech therapy Communication skills play an important part in life's experiences. In elementary school, children are developing language and learning to read and write. In order for a child to learn, he has to communicate and interact with his peers and adults. Spoken language is the basis for written language. As a child grows and develops, the two types of language interact and build upon each other to improve literacy and language. This process continues throughout a person's life. If a child has a communication disorder, they are often delayed in other areas, such as reading and math. The child may be very bright but unable to express themselves correctly, and the learning process can be affected negatively. Speech therapy can help children learn to communicate effectively with others and learn to solve problems and make decisions independently. Communication with peers and educators is an essential part of a fulfilling educational experience. Also, children who are able to overcome communication disorders feel a great sense of pride and confidence. Children who stutter may be withdrawn socially, but with the help of therapy and improved confidence, they can enjoy a fully active social life (ASHA).

Club career =Tranmere Rovers= Moore began his career at Tranmere Rovers, where he broke into the first team while still a teenager, and made more than 50 appearances. He also spent a short period on loan at Bradford City to gain more first team experience. His impact on a Tranmere side that at the time was a regular contender for promotion to the Premier League, where his records for goals and assists and all-round contribution to play were impressive, along with his inclusion in England youth sides at all levels up to under-21s, led many to believe he was destined to play at an even higher level. =Nottingham Forest= He made his first big-money move in March 1997 in a ¬£1million move to Nottingham Forest under Dave Bassett but failed to make a significant impact ‚Äì getting just one goal against Stoke City in 15 games and so was loaned out again, this time to West Ham United in the Premier League. Moore was given little chance at the Boleyn Ground and made just one substitute appearance in a 3‚Äì0 defeat to Southampton. =Stockport County= Stockport County was the next team to take a gamble on the goal-shy striker who signed him for a club record fee of ¬£800,000. To some extent the gamble paid off and Moore gave a goal return of almost one goal in every four games ‚Äì netting 20 times and becoming the club's leading scorer. =Burnley= This rapid improvement in form brought the attention of north west neighbours Burnley and Thomas-Moore moved to Turf Moor for a ¬£1million record transfer fee in the winter of 2000. Moore became known at Turf Moor for his pace and dedication, and regularly chased down goalkeepers and defenders to try and force mistakes. Moore went on to make almost 200 appearances for 'The Clarets', scoring 37 league goals in the process. He seemed to enjoy the FA Cup most though ‚Äì netting a hat-trick against Canvey Island and a double against Bournemouth. Some of his fans said he was like a \\"dog with a balloon\\". As his career progressed at Turf Moor, Moore was increasingly played as a winger, which was thought of as his best position considering his lack of goal scoring prowess but taking advantage of his pace. This was not a position which Moore enjoyed however, and he often visibly 'sulked' in games, and his previous dogged determination had gone. Whilst at Burnley he also suffered a series of injuries which, while not career ending, were severe enough for the previously quick striker to lose much of his pace. =Leeds United= In the last year of his contract, Leeds United decided to sign the striker, where he re-joined the ex-Burnley assistant manager, Sam Ellis. Moore was sold by Steve Cotterill for a fee of ¬£50,000, an amount many Burnley fans were surprised at due to the player's poor career with the Clarets. Moore hardly featured under manager Kevin Blackwell with many Leeds fans seeing Moore as a waste of time and space. However, on 19 September 2006 in the League Cup game against Barnet, Moore scored his first goals for Leeds United, netting twice to lead the team to a 3‚Äì1 victory. He then scored in the next round in a 3‚Äì1 defeat to Southend United. Under new manager, Dennis Wise, Moore played regularly and looked a completely new player. He scored his first league goal for Leeds United against Southend United at Elland Road in Wise's first game in charge (just 4 days after scoring against them in the League Cup). He later scored against Stoke City too, his second and final league goal for the club. However, he was released at the end of the season following his club's relegation to League One. =Hartlepool United= Moore signed for Hartlepool United on 12 July 2007, on a free transfer. But after nine goals from 30 appearances in all competitions he was transfer listed by the club in January 2008. =Back to Tranmere= On 31 January 2008 Moore joined his father Ronnie when he signed for Tranmere Rovers for an undisclosed fee. He scored on his debut against his former club Leeds United in a 2‚Äì0 Tranmere victory. He also netted against Millwall and Port Vale as he ended the season playing up front with Chris Greenacre. Moore continued his good form against old club Leeds by scoring in a 2‚Äì1 home victory in the 2008/09 season He ended up having an impressive season for Rovers, he scored 11 times as Rovers finished 7th and were two minutes away from clinching a play-off place.Scunthorpe 1‚Äì1 Tranmere BBC Sport, 2 May 2009 Thomas-Moore scored a quality double against Carlisle in Rovers' 4‚Äì1 win. He also added goals against the likes of Stockport, Southend and Oldham as well as gaining a goal of the season candidate with a volley against Scunthorpe in the Football League Trophy. Moore had another impressive season at Tranmere in 2009/10 season, having netted 15 goals, including two penalties against League One leaders Norwich City in a surprise 3‚Äì1 victory at Prenton Park.Tranmere 3‚Äì1 Norwich BBC Sport, 2 April 2010 Ian Thomas Moore scored his 100th football league goal against Norwich. Moore also netted against Southampton, Gillingham, Wycombe and Aldershot. One of his most important goals in the same season was a valuable equaliser as Tranmere earned a point away at Colchester in their bid to avoid relegation.Colchester 1‚Äì1 Tranmere BBC Sport, 24 April 2010 Again Moore proved why he was awarded Player of the Season at Tranmere, creating and scoring a vital penalty to put Tranmere 1‚Äì0 up in their vital clash against Millwall at Prenton Park, which resulted in Tranmere running out 2‚Äì0 winners. Moore also assisted in the second goal.Tranmere 3‚Äì1 Norwich BBC Sport, 2 April 2010 Moore's impressive season went all the way to the last game of the season away at Stockport County, where he scored the second goal in possibly the biggest game of his career.Stockport 0‚Äì3 Tranmere BBC Sport, 8 May 2010 In August 2010, manager Les Parry revealed that Moore had submitted a transfer request after being approached by another club, rumoured to be Rotherham United where his father Ronnie Moore was, at the time, manager. =Rotherham United= On 26 January 2011 Moore signed for Rotherham United for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut in a 4‚Äì0 win over his old club Stockport County and set up strike partner Adam le Fondre for the fourth goal of the game. On Twitter on 21 June 2011 Ian announced he had left Rotherham by mutual consent, three months after his father had also \\"left by mutual consent\\". He has since trained with League 2 club Accrington Stanley with a view to sign, but nothing materialised and on 18 August it was announced he had turned Stanley down on an offer of a non- contract basis. After his release from Rotherham he hinted he may hang his boots up and retire. He said \\"If nothing happens by the first week of August, I might have to call it a day.\\" In August 2011 Moore began training daily with Stockport County from the Conference Premier. On Tuesday 6 September 2011, Thomas-Moore posted on the social networking site Twitter that he was retiring from professional football.

Ronnie did so, and was installed as manager, the following day, until the end of the 2011‚Äì2012 season.

Two men are standing, the harpooner in the bow and another manning the aft rudder, while four oarsmen are seated. Skeleton of Old Tom in the Eden Killer Whale Museum Old Tom ( 1895 ‚Äì 17 September 1930) was a killer whale (orca) known to whalers in the port of Eden, New South Wales, on the southeast coast of Australia. Old Tom measured 22 feet (6.7 m) and weighed 6 tons, with a 3.33 feet (1 m) skull and teeth about 5.31 inches (13.4 cm) long. Old Tom was thought to be the leader of a pod of killer whales which helped the whalers by herding baleen whales into Twofold Bay. To gain the whalers' attention after his pod had cornered a baleen whale, he would position himself in front of the whaling station, breach and thrash his tail flukes until they would row out to meet him. After making the kill, the whalers then allowed the killer whales in Old Tom's pod to eat the tongues and lips as their share of the kill, a practice known as the \\"Law of the Tongue\\". Rumors suggest that the orcas were often freed from nets by the whalers in return for their aid, and in return, the orcas also helped repel sharks from the small whaling boats during the hunts. For three generations, the owners of the whaling station in Twofold Bay honoured this unique alliance, beginning with Alexander Davidson and his son George, until 1923, when Old Tom helped to drive a small whale to George Davidson's boat. A massive storm caused Davidson's shipmate, local retired pastoralist John Logan, to fight Old Tom for the carcass of the whale, ending with Logan damaging some of Old Tom's teeth. This would eventually lead to the killer whale dying of starvation; a fate Logan was said to have felt guilty of inflicting from that day forward.https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/running-ponies/the-legend-of-old- tom-and-the-gruesome-law-of-the-tongue/ On 17 September 1930, Old Tom was found dead in Twofold Bay.

The adult black-faced grosbeak is 16.5 cm long, weighs 36 g, and has a heavy, mainly black, bill. It has a black face, yellow head, neck and breast, and olive back, wings and tail. The rump and belly are grey. Immatures are duller and have duskier face markings. The vocalisations include sharp chip or tweet calls, buzzes and whistles, and the song is a musical whistled cher chi weet, cher chir weet, cher chi chuweet. The black-faced grosbeak forages in shrubs or trees for beetles, caterpillars and other insects, and also eats fruit such as those of gumbo-limboFoster (2007) (Bursera simaruba), seeds, and nectar taken from flowers or epiphyte bracts. It forms noisy flocks of up to 20 birds, and is often in mixed-species feeding flocks with honeycreepers and other tanagers as well as New World warblers. It generally tries to avoid human-altered habitat though it can be sometimes found in heavily degraded former subtropical or tropical forests.BirdLife International (2004) This species breeds in the Caribbean lowlands and foothills from sea level to about 1000 m altitude, and is found in the canopy and middle levels of dense wet forests, tall second growth, and semi-open habitats such as woodland edge and clearings. The nest is a bowl constructed from bromeliad leaves and other epiphytes 3‚Äì6 m high in a small tree or palm. The female lays three brown-spotted grey-white eggs between April and June.

The institution was initially known as Bowen Collegiate Institute. The name was changed to Lenox Collegiate Institute in October 1864 and to Lenox College in 1884. History The school was affiliated with the Presbyterian Church. Several buildings that were part of the former college campus are on the National Register of Historic Places and are maintained by the Delaware County Historical Society as the Delaware County Historical Museum Complex. The college campus and the community of Hopkinton are also designated as stops on the Delaware Crossing Iowa Scenic Byways. The former building of the Hopkinton Reformed Presbyterian Church is located next to the campus, although it was not a part of the college's sponsoring church. The centerpiece of the campus is the Civil War Monument, dedicated 17 November 1865. The monument at the center of the campus was the first monument on a campus dedicated to the American Civil War. The majority of the young men of the college with the dean of the college as their captain signed on for military service shortly after the war began, causing the school to close temporarily. The monument is dedicated to them. Construction of Old Main began in 1856. The Victorian style east wing was added in 1875. Clarke Hall, the dormitory for girls, was built in 1890. Doolittle Hall, constructed in 1900, contained the Library and Literary Societies. Finkbonner Hall (the gymnasium) was erected in 1916. Other buildings in the complex include the Hopkinton Depot, which was moved to the present site in 1969. The Reformed Presbyterian Church, with its remarkable Bavarian stained-glass windows, was dedicated in 1901 and donated to the Society in 1969. The one-room school was purchased and moved to its present location - next to the church - in 1971. A Farm Machinery Hall, which houses displays of horse-drawn farm equipment, was added in 1973.

Photo: Carleton Watkins Gold Hill, Nevada: before 1900 (top) and in 2007. Both photos taken from (roughly) the same viewpoint. An open-pit mine was dug (ramp lower left, bottom photo) after 1900. Gold Hill is an unincorporated community in Storey County, Nevada, located just south and downhill of Virginia City. Incorporated December 17, 1862, in order to prevent its annexation by its larger neighbor, the town at one point was home to at least 8,000 residents. Prosperity was sustained for a period of 20 years between 1868 and 1888 by mining the Comstock Lode, a major deposit of gold and silver ore. Mines such as the Yellow Jacket, Crown Point, and Belcher brought in over $10 million each in dividends. Historical remnants of the town can still be seen, including the Gold Hill Hotel, promoted as Nevada's oldest hotel, in existence since 1861; the former Bank of California building; the restored Virginia & Truckee Railroad depot; the Depression-Era Crown Point Mill; and remains of several of the mines and residences in various states of restoration and repair. Although in the shadow of neighboring Virginia City, Gold Hill, nonetheless enjoyed a lively entertainment industry. The Gold Hill News was established in 1863, and Gold Hill enjoyed a theater by 1862. The demographic mirrored Virginia City where one third of the population was engaged in mining and the Irish immigrant dominated numerically.

Today Gold Hill exists as a shell of its former self; its population in 2005 was 191.Storey County Nevada Demographics It is part of the Reno-Sparks Metropolitan Statistical Area. A later mining complex in the area operated from 1927 until 1942, when mining operations were shut down by War Production Board order L-208, shutting down all nonessential gold mines in the United States. Just under a hundred million dollars' worth of ore was extracted after 1930. Active mining has returned to lower Gold Hill, with the start of production at Comstock Mining's Lucerne, Hartford and Billy The Kid mines. In 1976, Bob Gray, a former Marine Corps photographer in World War II and admirer of the Virginia & Truckee Railroad since he was a teenager, bought a section of the abandoned railway line between Virginia City and a point about two miles south. He laid track on that right of way and began operating a steam-powered tourist railroad.The Silver Short Line, Ted Wurm and Harry Demoro, Trans Anglo Press, 1983 The track was extended to Gold Hill in 1992, and in 1994 the Gold Hill Historical Society was established to preserve the Gold Hill depot, one of the few wooden structures in the region that survived the 1875 fire in Virginia City. After ten years of applying for grants, lobbying, and collecting steel rail donations by the Gold Hill Historical Society, the mayor of Carson City approved the letting out to bid of a contract to reconstruct the railroad between Gold Hill and the Carson River, fifteen miles away.Railroad Project On, Virginia City Register, Volume 4 Issue 29, January 16, 2004 Today Gold Hill is a stop on this tourist railroad, which operates historic steam trains attracting thousands of tourists each year.

James Stewart is featured in one of only three musical film roles that he played: the first was Born to Dance (1936) in which he introduced the Cole Porter standard \\"Easy To Love\\" and the second was Pot O' Gold (1941). This was also his final onscreen appearance in a live-action film. The screenplay and song score are supplied by the prolific Sherman Brothers, who worked as staff songwriters for Walt Disney and wrote songs for his films such as Mary Poppins (1964). Their song \\"When You're Loved\\" was nominated for an Academy Award for \\"Best Original Song\\" and was sung by Debby Boone. It is also the only musical film featuring Lassie. Released in the wake of Star Wars, the film was critically panned as old- fashioned, and flopped at the box office. Critics expressed dismay at Stewart singing unmemorable songs as the grandfather. Following the film's failure, he semiretired from acting. Plot The Mitchell Vineyard, in the rolling hills of Northern California, is the very blood of Clovis Mitchell (James Stewart), a spare and dignified grandfather and guardian to Kelly (Stephanie Zimbalist) and her brother Chris (Michael Sharrett). The heart of the household, though, is Lassie, a handsome young collie, affectionate, obedient, sensitive, and very wise. A threat is in the air one night when Jamison (Pernell Roberts) and his associate Finch (Robert Lussier) appear at the winery and offer to buy the land from Clovis. They get a refusal from the old man, while Lassie growls in the background. Jamison promises to return, and does, to claim Lassie, one of a litter he says escaped during a fire. She has a tattoo mark in her right ear to prove it. Clovis has no alternative but to give up the dog, and tells his heart-broken grandchildren. Lassie has an alternative; taken by private plane to Jamison's home in Colorado Springs, fitted with a handsome green collar with gold studs, Lassie makes her escape. Chased by helicopter and kennel men through the rocks and hills of Colorado, Lassie manages to elude them and out- stare a cougar before she joins up with new friends ‚Äì Gus (Mickey Rooney), a down-at-heel wrestling manager and Apollo (Mike Mazurki), a kindly mountain of a man and Gus's so-called star. About the time they are binding up Lassie's sores, giving her food and water, and moving along in their van, young Chris bolts on his first day of the school term and sets off alone in search of Lassie. With his distraught grandfather setting out to find the boy, and Kelly and her sweetheart, attorney Allan Fogerty (Lane Davies), checking with the police, Chris takes a car conveyor in the direction of Colorado Springs. Soon after the truck takes off, a hungry and frightened Chris leaves the vehicle, buys food in a restaurant from a sympathetic waitress (Alice Faye), then goes out to look for another truck, and finally dives into the back of a cattle truck. The restaurant waitress, hearing reports of Chris's disappearance, calls his home and tells his sister where the boy has been, but Chris is on the move again, and so is Lassie. He in an empty cattle truck, she in the doorway of a freight car. Lassie leaps from the freight car and continues her journey. Clovis and the police officer who is aiding in the search for Chris, hear his cries as he is about to be crushed by a herd of Longhorns being loaded into his hiding place. Everybody is home ‚Äì everybody but Lassie, whose ownership by Clovis has been clarified by Allan, the young attorney, who is about to join the family as an in-law. Lassie continues her long, painful journey. Wet, sore-footed, and limping, she stumbles upon the Mike Curb Congregation, who are rehearsing. The group takes Lassie along to their engagement, where a flare is knocked over, causing a fire. Panic ensues. Lassie is trying to save the life of a kitten from a burning dressing room and is presumed dead, but she is not, and the next day ‚Äì Thanksgiving ‚Äì Lassie, tired and filthy, comes wagging over the hill to Chris, Clovis, Kelly, and home.

Origins Variations of the name in use in the medieval era were Balanja, Bananja, Bananju, and Banijiga, with probable cognates Balijiga, Valanjiyar, Balanji, Bananji and derivatives such as Baliga, all of which are said to be derived from the Sanskrit term Vanik or Vanij, for trader. Beginning in the 11th century, references are found in inscriptions throughout the Kannada and Tamil areas to a trading network, which is sometimes referred to as a guild, called the Five Hundred Lords of Ayyavolu that provided trade links between trading communities in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka. From the 13th century, inscriptions referring to \\"Vira Balanjyas\\" (warrior merchants) started appearing in the Andhra country. The Vira Balanjyas, whose origins are often claimed to lie in the Ayyavolu, represented long-distance trading networks that employed fighters to protect their warehouses and goods in transit. The traders were identified as nanadesi (of 'many countries') and as swadesi ('own country'). The terms balanjya-setti and balija were also used for these traders, and in later times naidu and chetti. These traders formed collectives called pekkandru and differentiated themselves from other collectives called nagaram, which probably represented Komati merchants. The pekkandru collectives also included members of other communities with status titles reddi, boya and nayaka. They spread all over South India, Sri Lanka, and also some countries in the Southeast Asia. Rao et al. note that the Balijas included a configuration of castes representing a combination of the martial and the mercantile. They were mobilised politically by the Vijayanagara emperor Krishnadevaraya. Later, in the 15th and 16th centuries, they colonised the Tamil country and established Nayaka chieftaincies. At this time, Balija was often an umbrella term that, in addition to the Balija proper, included the Boyas, Gollas, Gavaras, and other castes. Cynthia Talbot believes that in Andhra the transformation of occupational descriptors into caste-based descriptors did not occur until at least the 17th century. The classification of people as Balija was one of many challenges for the census enumerators of the British Raj era, whose desire was to reduce a complex social system to one of administrative simplicity using theories of evolutionary anthropology. Early Raj census attempts in Madras Presidency recorded a wide variety of people claiming to be members of Balija subcastes but who appeared to share little in common and thus defied the administrative desire for what it considered to be a rational and convenient taxonomy. Those who claimed to be Chetty had an obvious connection through their engagement in trade and those who called themselves Kavarai were simply using the Tamil word for Balija but, for example, the Linga based their claim to Balija status on a sectarian identification, the Gazula were bangle-makers by occupation, the Telaga had Telugu origins and the Rajamahendram also appeared to be a geographic claim based on their origins in the town of Rajahmundry. Subsequent attempts to rationalise the enumeration merely created other anomalies and caused upset. Balija branches There are numerous branches, sub-divisions or social groups which make up the larger Balija social group. * Balija Chettis (or Chetti Balija): Mentioned in several Vijayanagar accounts as wealthy merchants who controlled powerful trading guilds. To secure their loyalty, the Vijayanagar kings made them Desais or \\"superintendents of all castes in the country.\\" They were classified as right-hand castes.Bowmen of Mid-India: a monograph of the Bhils of Jhabua [M. P.] and adjoining territories, Volume 2, page 243 David Rudner claims that the Balija Chettis became a separate caste from the Balija Nayak warriors as recent as the 19th century; and accordingly they have closer kinship ties to the Nayak warriors than to Chetti merchants. *According to Kanakalatha Mukund, the Balija merchants of Tamil Nadu are called Kavarai. That is the Tamilised rendition of Gavara. Caste titles Some Balijas use surnames such as Naidu or Nayudu, and Naicker, which share a common root. Nayaka as a term was first used during the Vishnukundina dynasty that ruled from the Krishna and Godavari deltas during the 3rd century AD. During the Kakatiya dynasty, the Nayaka title was bestowed to warriors who had received land and the title as a part of the Nayankarapuvaram system for services rendered to the court. The Nayaka was noted to be an officer in the Kakatiya court; there being a correlation between holding the Nayankara, the possession of the administrative title Angaraksha and the status title Nayaka. A more widespread usage of the Nayaka title amongst the Balijas appears to have happened during the Vijayanagara empire where the Balija merchant- warriors rose to political and cultural power and claimed Nayaka positions.Stearns, Peter N. and Langer, Leonard W. (2001). The Encyclopedia of world history, p.368 Dynasties The Vijayanagara empire was based on an expanding, cash-oriented economy enhanced by Balija tax-farming. Some Balija families were appointed to supervise provinces as Nayaks (governors, commanders) by the Vijayanagara kings, some of which are: * Madurai Nayaks * Tanjavur Nayaks * Gingee Nayaks / Senji / Chenchi Nayakas, Thundeera *Chandragiri:Kasturi Nayadu and Peda Koneti Nayudu of the Vasarasi family belonged to the Balija caste. Varna status Velcheru Narayana Rao and Sanjay Subrahmanyam say that the emergence of left-hand caste Balijas as trader-warrior-kings was evidence in the Nayak period as a consequence of conditions of new wealth, produced by collapsing two varnas, Kshatriya and Vaishya, into one. Based on the brahmanical conceptualisation of caste during the British Raj period, Balijas were accorded the Shudra position. The fourfold Brahmanical varna concept has not been acceptable to non-Brahmin social groups and some of them challenged the authority of Brahmins who described them as shudras.

In the late 1930s Laffin was employed as a trainee journalist on the staff of Smith's Weekly, one of Australia's most patriotic newspaper-style magazines, and the Wagga Wagga Advertiser. In 1941 he enlisted as a Private into the 2nd Australian Imperial Force, subsequently being commissioned as an officer and going on to see active service in the New Guinea campaign in World War 2. Journalism, education and writing career After the war, Laffin worked for a number of newspapers and magazines and began his own feature service and editing unit. In the mid-1950s he relocated with his family to the United Kingdom, where he resided for 40 years, earning a living initially as a school master, teaching History, English and Geography in secondary schools, one of which was Mayfield College in East Sussex (where he taught in the 1960s whilst living in Herstmonceux). In the late 1950s he attempted to establish himself as a fiction writer, publishing several novellas under the pseudonyms 'Carl Dekker' and 'Mark Napier', but without commercial success.Biography of John Laffin, 'Austlit' website (2020). https://www.austlit.edu.au/austlit/page/A44033?mainTabTemplate=agentWorksBy In the early 1960s, whilst still working as a teacher, he began writing military histories, which after a few years sold well enough to allow him to abandon teaching and earn a living as a professional military historian and writer, as well as intermittent pieces of journalism in the field. Laffin was a prodigious author, producing works - many of which possessed a personally opinionated viewpoint of their subject matter - regularly for publication on a range of modern military history subjects, ranging from conflicts in the Middle East, the Falklands War, and several works on World War 2, but the central subject that he returned to repeatedly throughout his career over the next 40 years was the British experience of World War 1. He travelled extensively in Europe, especially along the old battlefields of World War 1's Western Front. In the field of World War 1 history he was trenchantly of \\"The Donkeys\\" school of thought on the subject of British Generalship, castigating the British Army High Command's conduct of military operations in the war as being wantonly profligate with the lives of its soldiers. His views, generally expressed in a choleric fashion, in this regard were detailed in his work British Butchers & Bunglers of World War One (1998), and he appeared in a British Broadcasting Corporation 'Timewatch' series television documentary on Field Marshal Earl Haig, entitled Haig: The Unknown Soldier (1996), proffering the same historical commentary.Entry in IMDb website for 'Haig: The Unknown Soldier'. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9390464/ Laffin was the instigator behind the creation of the Australian Corps Memorial Park, at Le Hamel, France, dedicated to the Australian troops who served on the Western Front in World War 1.Australian Corps Memorial Park information page, on 'The Great War.co.uk' website (2019). http://www.greatwar.co.uk/somme/memorial-le- hamel.htm He also founded the 'Families & Friends of the 1st Australian Imperial Force', a Society dedicated to maintaining the historical and cultural memory of the men of Australia's primary expeditionary force that fought in World War 1.In memorium page dedicated to Laffin on the Society's website (2019). http://fffaif.org.au/?page_id=27 Death Laffin returned to reside in Australia from the United Kingdom in failing health in 1995.

Born in Bucharest, she grew up in England and France, and lived in Romania from 1908 to 1952, when she escaped from the communist regime on a Danube boat. An expatriate in the United States for 35 years, and a longtime resident of the Hill Country of Texas, she returned after the Romanian Revolution of 1989 to Bucharest, where she died a centenarian. Humanitarian - Honours  Princess Caradja is known for her humanitarian work in the interbellum, and especially for her efforts to ease the burden of captivity for over a thousand American and British airmen, taken prisoner during the bombing of Romania in World War II. She cared for them on her property and in the hospitals she ran; those activities earned her the nickname \\"Angel of Ploie≈üti\\" among the crews. In 1977, she was awarded the George Washington Honor Medal by the Freedoms Foundation at Valley Forge. Early years She was born in Bucharest, the daughter of Princess Irina Cantacuzino and Prince Radu Cre≈£ulescu. Caught in a financial struggle between her parents' families, she was abducted at the age of three by her father, who took her to England, and placed her in an orphanage under an assumed name. Her mother (who divorced her father, and remarried to Prince Nicolae Ghica) kept looking for her, but died in 1906. The princess was accidentally found in 1908 in a French convent by an aunt, who helped her escape, and brought her back to Romania, where the courts put her in custody of the Cantacuzino family. She was raised by her maternal grandmother and her maternal grandfather, Prince Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino, the Prime Minister of Romania at the turn of the 20th century.Glen E. Lich, \\"Catherine Olympia Caradja\\", at The Handbook of Texas OnlineWilliam J. Fili, \\"Biography of Princess Catherine Caradja\\"Catherine Caradja (1990), \\"Princess Catherine Caradja\\", in: Force for freedom: the legacy of the 98th, Paducah, KY: Turner Pub., 1990, p. 102 The princess was educated in England, France, Romania, and Belgium, and spoke five languages. In 1914, just before the start of World War I, she married Prince Constantin Caradja (1892-1962), a member of the Caradja family. After German troops entered Romania in 1916 (see Romanian Campaign (World War I)), she fled from Bucharest with her two daughters, Ir√®ne Mathilde Catherine (born the year before) and Marie Constance Lucie (born ten days before). After taking refuge in Moldavia, she started working as a volunteer in a 30-bed hospital for typhus patients (she contracted the disease herself). After the Armistice, Princess Caradja went back to Bucharest, and devoted herself to social work, most notably, at Saint Catherine's Crib, a complex of orphanages started by her mother, which housed more than 3,000 children. In 1920, she gave birth to a third daughter, Alexandra. The second daughter died in Vienna in 1933, while her eldest daughter and her husband (Constantin Emandi) were killed in the deadly earthquake of November 10, 1940. World War II and aftermath B-24s from the 15th Air Force bomb Ploie≈üti oil fields. The princess first became known internationally as a result of her opposition to Romania's alliance with Nazi Germany during the Second World War (see Romania during World War II). When the oilfields at Ploie≈üti were bombed by the Allies in August 1943 in Operation Tidal Wave, she personally took custody of surviving Allied crews, saw that they were cared for in her hospitals, and facilitated their escape to Italy. During the Allied bombings of spring and summer 1944, several American airmen landed on her estate at Nedelea, after either emergency landing or parachuting. Throughout the war, she eased the burden of captivity for more than one thousand flyers who had been shot down. Those deeds earned her the nickname \\"Angel of Ploie≈üti\\" among the airmen. Diana Evantia Barca, \\"Prizonieri in Rom√¢nia\\" , interview with Princess Brianna Caradja, April 18, 2004 One of the pilots who survived crash landing, and escaped thanks to her efforts, was Richard W. Britt, who recounted the story in a book, many years later. After the Communist regime was established in Romania, her orphanages and foundation were nationalized in 1949. Her daughter, who had left for Paris in 1948, helped the princess escape in early 1952, with assistance from the French secret services; she left the country on a Danube tanker, arriving after 8 weeks in Vienna. During the winter of 1954‚Äì55, the princess directed relief efforts for children in Algiers, in the wake of the September 9, 1954 earthquake. She traveled widely, giving talks in France on \\"Life Behind the Iron Curtain\\", and speaking at the BBC. In America In December 1955, Caradja received a visa to come to the United States; soon after landing, she appeared on the Dave Garroway show. She resided in the U.S. for more than 35 years, mainly in the town of Comfort (in the Hill Country of Texas), but also in Baltimore, Maryland and in Kansas City. While traveling across America, speaking at various venues, she found more than five hundred of the former prisoners of war she knew from Romania. She organized a reunion in Dallas, Texas on August 28, 1972, an event that continued to be held each year for many years, with the Princess as the guest of honor and main speaker. On August 27, 1976, during the U.S. bicentennial year, she helped present a Peace Monument for the Freedoms Foundation at the Valley Forge National Historical Park; in January 1977 she was awarded the George Washington Honor Medal by the Foundation. In 1978 she befriended Ottomar Berbig, an antiques dealer in West Berlin. The princess was keen to adopt Berbig, as her family had no male heirs to carry the family name. Berbig took the name of Ottomar Rodolphe Vlad Dracula Prince Kretzulesco, and the adoption was formalized in 1990.Erik Kirschbaum, \\"Dracula's Kingdom!\\" Back to Romania Kretzulescu Church After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, the new Romanian government decided in early 1991 to return to Princess Caradja more than of her estate. In mid-1991, she went back to her native country, taking up residence in her old orphanage. She died at age 100, on May 26, 1993, and was buried in the family tomb, in Bucharest. A memorial service was held at the historic Kretzulescu Church. Her daughter, Alexandra (aka. \\"Tanda\\" Bragadiru Moevs Layer), died in 1997; she is survived by her granddaughter, Princess Brianna (\\"Tanda\\") Caradja (b. 1960, ex-wife of Mr. Bruce Johnson), and two great-grandsons. She was also survived by her son, through adoption, Ottomar Rodolphe Vlad Dracula Prince Kretzulesco.

The poem is from his last volume of poems Bush Ballads and Galloping Rhymes published in 1870, when he was living at Melbourne. In The Poems of Adam Lindsay GordonSladen, p. 99, it is grouped among \\"Poems Swinburnian in Form and Pessimism, but full of the Personality of Gordon.\\" The poem was set to music by Sir Edward Elgar as the fifth and last song in his song-cycle Sea Pictures. Lyrics Square brackets [ ] indicate text omitted in Elgar's song. Italics indicate text repeated in the song. \\"The Swimmer\\" With short, sharp, violent lights made vivid, To southward far as the sight can roam ; Only the swirl of the surges livid, The seas that climb and the surfs that comb. Only the crag and the cliff to nor'ward, [And] the rocks receding, and reefs flung forward, [And] waifs wrecked seaward and wasted shoreward On shallows sheeted with flaming foam. A grim, grey coast and a seaboard ghastly, And shores trod seldom by feet of men -‚Äì Where the battered hull and the broken mast lie, They have lain embedded these long years ten. Love! Love! when we wander'd here together, Hand in hand! Hand in hand through the sparkling weather, From the heights and hollows of fern and heather, God surely loved us a little then. The skies were fairer and shores were firmer --Elgar: \\"The skies were fairer, the shores were firmer --\\" The blue sea over the bright sand rolled ; Babble and prattle, and ripple and murmur, Sheen of silver and glamour of gold ‚Äì Sheen of silver and glamour of gold - [And the sunset bath'd in the gulf to lend her A garland of pinks and of purples tender, A tinge of the sun-god's rosy splendour, A tithe of his glories manifold.] [Man's works are graven, cunning, and skilful On earth, where his tabernacles are ; But the sea is wanton, the sea is wilful, And who shall mend her and who shall mar ? Shall we carve success or record disaster On the bosom of her heaving alabaster ? Will her purple pulse beat fainter or faster For fallen sparrow or fallen star ?] [I would that with sleepy, soft embraces The sea would fold me ‚Äì would find me rest, In luminous shades of her secret places, In depths where her marvels are manifest ; So the earth beneath her should not discover My hidden couch ‚Äì nor the heaven above her ‚Äì As a strong love shielding a weary lover, I would have her shield me with shining breast.] [When light in the realms of space lay hidden, When life was yet in the womb of time, Ere flesh was fettered to fruits forbidden, And souls were wedded to care and crime, Was the course foreshaped for the future spirit ‚Äì A burden of folly, a void of merit ‚Äì That would fain the wisdom of stars inherit, And cannot fathom the seas sublime ?] [Under the sea or the soil (what matter ? The sea and the soil are under the sun), As in the former days in the latter The sleeping or waking is known of none. Surely the sleeper shall not awaken To griefs forgotten or joys forsaken, For the price of all things given and taken, The sum of all things done and undone.] [Shall we count offences or coin excuses, Or weigh with scales the soul of a man, Whom a strong hand binds and a sure hand looses, Whose light is a spark and his life a span ? The seed he sowed or the soil he cumbered, The time he served or the space he slumbered ; Will it profit a man when his days are numbered, Or his deeds since the days of his life began ?] [One, glad because of the light, saith, 'Shall not The righteous Judge of all the earth do right, For behold the sparrows on the house-tops fall not Save as seemeth to Him good in His sight ?' And this man's joy shall have no abiding Through lights departing and lives dividing, He is soon as one in the darkness hiding, One loving darkness rather than light.] [A little season of love and laughter, Of light and life, and pleasure and pain, And a horror of outer darkness after, And dust returneth to dust again. Then the lesser life shall be as the greater, And the lover of life shall join the hater, And the one thing cometh sooner or later, And no one knoweth the loss or gain.] [Love of my life ! we had lights in season ‚Äì Hard to part from, harder to keep ‚Äì We had strength to labour and souls to reason, And seed to scatter and fruits to reap. Though time estranges and fate disperses, We have had our loves and our loving-mercies ; Though the gifts of the light in the end are curses, Yet bides the gift of the darkness ‚Äì sleep !] See ! girt with tempest and winged with thunder,Elgar: \\"So, girt with tempest and winged with thunder,\\" And clad with lightning and shod with sleet, The strong winds treading the swift waves sunderElgar: \\"And strong winds treading the swift waves under The flying rollers with frothy feet. One gleam like a bloodshot sword-blade swims on The skyline, staining the green gulf crimson, A death stroke fiercely dealt by a dim sun, That strikes through his stormy winding-sheet.

Bothies are farm outbuildings, where unmarried labourers used to sleep, often in harsh conditions. In the evening, to entertain themselves, these bothy bands sang. Several Child Ballads that had died out elsewhere in the UK survived until the 1920s, sung by these workers. It was a male-only environment and some songs are obscene. They celebrated ploughmen as lovers (\\"The Plooman Laddies\\", \\"My Darling Ploughman Boy\\").  Subjects  The farmlands around Aberdeen produced satirical songs, critical of working conditions. The best known is \\"The Barnyards of Delgaty\\", (a pun on \\"The Barren Yirds o Delgaty\\" meaning \\"The Barren Soils of Delgaty\\"). Real names of farmers, supervisors and farms are given, and mocked. Other satirical attacks are \\"Rhynie\\", \\"The Guise O Tough\\" and \\"Harrowing Time\\". By contrast \\"The Bogheid Crew\\" is a celebration of the fine work done by the labourers, naming each one in turn. Some songs celebrate the countryside, including \\"Where The Gadie Rins\\", \\"Bonny Udny\\" and \\"Arlin's Fine Braes\\". Some songs match a high- born with a servant. The most famous is \\"The Knight and the Shepherd's Daughter\\" (Child Ballad 110), recorded by Steeleye Span as \\"Royal Forrester\\". \\"The Laird o Dainty Doonby\\" is another. In 1951 Davie Stewart sang this song for American collector Alan Lomax. It is a version of a song published by David Herd in 1776, in \\"Ancient and Modern Scottish Songs\\". Soldiers from Highland military regiments sometimes ended up working in bothies. Some ballads concern encounters between soldiers and innocent maids. \\"The Trooper and the Maid\\" (Child Ballad 299) is one. Most famous of all is \\"The Bonnie Lass o' Fyvie\\" (Pretty Peggy-O), covered by Simon and Garfunkel and many others. \\"The Forfar Sodger\\" relates to the Peninsular War (1808‚Äì1814) and was recorded as late as 1951. Diddling - Another variety of Bothy Ballad, usually used during breaks in music  Notable recordings  In the mid-1960s Grampian Television produced two series of programs re-enacting the kind of songs that were sung in bothies. It was called Bothy Nichts. A tragic song might be followed by a joke or a story, then a humorous song. Only rarely would a servant girl be present at these events, and musical instruments were also rare, but they appeared on the shows. Lomax interviewed John Strachan (singer) (1875‚Äì1958), Jimmy MacBeath (1894‚Äì1972) and Davie Stewart (1901‚Äì1972). Hamish Henderson recorded bothy songs from Willie Scott (1897‚Äì1989).

It was founded in 1929 as the Pedestrians‚Äô Association and became known as the Pedestrians‚Äô Association for Road Safety in 1952. The current name was adopted in 2001. It is a voting member of the International Federation of Pedestrians. History A young journalist, Tom Foley, became aware of the issue of road safety and contacted Viscount Cecil of Chelwood who was also increasingly concerned about the subject. Together they formed the Pedestrians‚Äô Association and its first meeting was held in 1929. This was announced: The Association was formed at a meeting held in the Essex Hall, London, on 13 August 1929. The meeting was convened jointly by Messrs J.J. Bailey and T.C. Foley, and was one by private invitation to people who had written to Viscount Cecil about pedestrians‚Äô grievances or who had written to T.C. Foley following a letter he had sent to the press. The Pedestrians‚Äô Association explained its purpose as follows: in view of the serious danger of motor traffic today, an association be formed for the defence of public rights, especially of pedestrians.[attribution needed] Viscount Cecil of Chelwood, who was president from 1929 until 1944, was a high profile peer and had established the League of Nations. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1937.[2] The following year the Road Traffic Act 1930 removed the existing 20 mph speed limit for motor cars at a time when UK road casualties were running at a rate of 7,000 per year (which is nearly three times the current rate).[2] They also helped write the very first Highway Code which was first published in full in 1934.[2] During the 1930s its campaigns helped to persuade the British Government to introduce the driving test, to reinstate a speed limit for motorcars and pedestrian crossings. A speed limit of 30 mph in urban areas and for driving tests was within the Road Traffic Act 1934.[2] As a result of lobbying during World War Two, the association lobbied the government to amend its regulations to allow pedestrians to carry a small hand torch and to paint the sides of the road white, to increase pedestrian safety. In 1950, following his retirement, Hore-Belisha was made vice-president.[2] and in 1952 the organisation changed its name to the Pedestrians‚Äô Association for Road Safety.[2] The organisation changed its name to Living Streets in 2001[2] Activities The charity has around 100 local branches and affiliated groups across the UK, and also undertakes consultancy work for local authorities. =Walk to school campaign= The charity is best known for its Walk to School campaign, which has been going for over 20 years and supports over one million children in 4000 schools to walk more. Living Streets‚Äô WOW ‚Äì year-round walk to school challenge and Walk to School Week make up the campaign, which is one of the UK‚Äôs leading behaviour change campaigns for young people. =Other campaigns= Other high profile campaigns the charity has played an integral part in, include a recent appeal to all London Mayoral candidates (2015) to pedestrianise Oxford Street. New Mayor, Sadiq Khan has committed to carrying out this work by 2020. Living Streets has also made headway, along with the Guide Dogs, on giving power to local authorities to limit pavement parking only to roads which need it. The charity‚Äôs work in Scotland has provoked further development, with commitment for cutting pavement parking by the current government.

The group was a jug band, incorporating the usual jug, banjo, guitar and fiddle, but it was also considered as a jazz band due to its use of alto saxophone, trombone, piano, and clarinet (played by Johnny Dodds). With this wide variety of instruments, the Dixieland Jug Blowers became the most sophisticated of its time, and influenced other jug bands of the time such as the Memphis Jug Band. The Dixieland Jug Band was created by the commingling of two separate groups run by jug player Earl McDonald, and fiddler Clifford Hayes. They were brought together in 1926 for a Victor Records recording session in Chicago, Illinois, and again in 1927. McDonald had been a musician for almost 30 years, and favored the earlier traditional and minstrel tunes. Hayes, on the other hand, favored a more straight ahead jazz styled approach, eventually dispensing with the jug altogether. Legacy The Dixieland Jug Blowers' recording of \\"Banjoreno\\" was used by animator Terry Gilliam in his \\"Brian Islam and Brucie\\" segment for the BBC comedy series Monty Python's Flying Circus. \\"Banjoreno\\" was also a favorite music cue of Jean Shepherd during his WOR radio shows. \\"Banjoreno\\" was reissued in 2017 on the 5-CD compilation album American Epic: The Collection, on the Sony Legacy record label.

Normington. Phantom Records was one of Australia's first significant indie labels, and the store was known for its guerilla marketing strategies. History Phantom Records began on 17 October 1978 as a record store on Pitt Street in Sydney. The store was opened by Jennings in partnership with former White Light Records staffers Lee Taylor and John Foy. It began with ex-White Light stock and was fronted by a large window, emblazoned with 'Phantom Records - The Big Beat in the Heart of the Vinyl Jungle' (attaching itself to the Phantom comic theme). In August 1974, Jules R. B. Normington was managing the import vinyl store Ripple Records (later known as Revolver Records), located in Angel Arcade, Sydney. Via his longterm relationship with some of the members of Australian punk band, Radio Birdman, Normington had become the band's first roadie and 'sound guy'. He later became their first manager. Early in 1978, Normington left Revolver Records and joined up with Radio Birdman on the UK leg of their European tour, supporting the Flamin' Groovies. Soon after, Jennings joined the tour, and while travelling together at one stage, Jennings discussed opening his own record store, which he did upon his return to Australia. Because of his screen printing background, Foy was eventually redeployed in Jenning's T-shirt factory to allow space for new store staffer, Radio Birdman singer Rob Younger. Foy still worked in the store on Weekends. By early 1979, Normington was living in Los Angeles sending back stock for Jennings' new store to Australia. Normington's 'occupation' whilst living in L.A. (and San Francisco) was, quite simply, to hunt down 60's punk/psychedelic/garage/surf/mod/R&B;/soul records and other vinyl rarities to send back to Sydney. Jennings eventually entreated Normington to come back and manage the shop. He returned on 9 July 1979 and joined Jennings as a partner. They soon employed Steve Stavrakis (who later started Waterfront Records), and Normington turned Phantom into a mecca for record buyers. Phantom specialised in \\"punk, soul, surf, psychedelic, sixties garage and nothing else\\". In late 1979, Normington and Jennings had the idea for the Phantom label when they realised they were surrounded by unsigned talent. Their girlfriends, Penny Ward and Julie Mostyn respectively, were both lead singers in bands. And post- Radio Birdman band The Visitors had an album's worth of material (recorded before their final gig in August 1979). Meanwhile, Foy explored his screen printing skills with posters in the Phantom T-shirt factory after hours. He named his poster outfit Skull Printworks as an homage to his surroundings. Foy spent most of 1980 in the US, during which most of his connections with Phantom Records faded. Late in the year, he returned to Phantom T-shirts and continued with Skull Printworks, including producing posters for a number of Phantom Records releases. Foy eventually departed the Phantom empire to join Red Eye Records, where he established his own independent label of the same name. On 30 April 1980, the first single on the Phantom label, \\"Face with No Name\\" by The Passengers was released. 7 days later, \\"Cool in the Tube\\" by Surfside 6 was released. Phantom Records went on to become an indie phenomenon, releasing the debut records of great Australian bands such as the Hoodoo Gurus, Sunnyboys, Flaming Hands, Stephen Cummings, Machinations, punk legends The Kelpies, and an early EP by The Cockroaches. These were followed by a succession of pivotal singles and EPs, and the label became as important as the shop in its exposure of new alternative music. Aside from its music, Phantom was known for its record covers sporting exemplary artwork by local artists such as Libby Blainey, John Foy, Paul Worstead, and Gerard Rouen. Normington and Jennings had intended licensing similar music from international artists too, but only ever got as far as one single by Stiv Bators And The Dead Boys. All other releases on Phantom remained exclusively by Australian artists. Although the shop's stock was primarily informed by Normington's taste, the label's signings reflected the personal taste of both he and Jennings who would only release a record if they decided (both of them) that they would personally buy it, if it already existed, per se. For several years, this creditable selection criteria led to one success after another. Phantom became an inspiration for other labels, such as Waterfront Records and Citadel Records, catering to the burgeoning local scene and attracting bands from interstate. The label's momentum slowed in the mid 1980s. During this period, Jennings concentrated on his 100% Mambo clothing company as he phased himself out of Phantom, and Normington was concentrating on sourcing the broadest range of vinyl (and music magazines) in the aforementioned categories, from all over the world. In 1987, Normington threw himself back into the Phantom label with renewed vigour, justified by the success of The Hummingbirds, The Sparklers, The Deadly Hume, The Mark of Cain, Even As We Speak and Vanilla Chainsaws. In the late 1980s, Normington decided to form a small new label called Messiah Complex. Initially devoted to releasing \\"crushing and fierce garage-punk and grunge 45's only\\", the label was headed by 'an evil megalomaniac' by the name of Dexter Baxter. Baxter, in said role, was sued by Waterfront Records management after unleashing remarks, defamatory to the Waterfront management (personally)...and likewise to many Australian major labels as well...in his very first press-release. By all reports, it was well-worded and a hilarious read. Messiah Complex released exclusive vinyl by Big Chief, Superchunk, Canberra's Stooges fanatics Mudrac, ferocious Texan grunge-merchants Sugar Shack, and NZ punks Casualty, plus a couple of CDs by Sydney punks Downtime. After several years, and with Jennings opting out altogether, Sebastian Chase became a partner in Phantom Records. He had been a founding member of the major label offshoot rooArt Records, in the late eighties. In 1991, Chase had left rooArt after a split with partner Chris Murphy and approached Phantom. Normington knew of him as The Hummingbirds had moved from Phantom to rooArt several years earlier. They signed another wave of bands such as Def FX, and The Whitlams and had great success. They also formed a subsidiary label called Freakzone and released the first several releases by Parliament/Funkadelic-styled funk band SWOOP on that imprint. Eventually, Phantom was divided into three companies. The shop, the record labels, and a music collectibles arm. Normington increasingly focused on Phantom Collectibles. Every 3 or 4 months, he published auction catalogues under the title of \\"Plunder The Vaults\\", featuring around 3,000 hand-picked gems. Ultimately, Chase's goals for the Phantom companies diverged from Normington's, to the detriment of the label. The shop closed its doors in April 1998, just short of 20 years since it opened. In 1999, disenchanted with what the Phantom label had become under Chase's guidance, Normington formed Laughing Outlaw Records, pulling in writer Stuart Coupe as a partner and unleashing another slew of quality music. Normington left Phantom in 2000 to run his own music collectables business, also cutting his ties with Laughing Outlaw two years later.

Erected after the Great Plague epidemic in 1679, the Baroque memorial is one of the most well-known and prominent sculptural pieces of art in the city. Christine M. Boeckl, author of Images of Plague and Pestilence, calls it \\"one of the most ambitious and innovative sculptural ensembles created anywhere in Europe in the post-Bernini era.\\" History In 1679, Vienna was visited by one of the last big plague epidemics. Fleeing the city, the Habsburg emperor Leopold I vowed to erect a mercy column if the epidemic would end. In the same year, a provisional wooden column made by Johann Fr√ºhwirth was inaugurated, showing the Holy Trinity on a Corinthian column together with nine sculpted angels (for the Nine Choirs of Angels). In 1683, Matthias Rauchmiller was commissioned to create a general design as well as some sculptures. Rauchmiller died in 1686, but his basic conception and three of his angel figures can still be seen on the modern monument. Several new designs followed, among others by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach, who designed the sculptures at the base of the column. Finally, the project management was assigned to Paul Strudel, who based his work on the concept of theatre engineer Lodovico Burnacini. Below the Trinity figure, Burnacini envisioned a cloud pyramid with angel sculptures as well as the kneeling emperor Leopold, praying to a sculpture of faith. Among others, the sculptors Tobias Kracker and Johann Bendel contributed to the column. The column was inaugurated in 1694. In spite of the long construction period, the frequent amendments of the design and the large number of sculptors involved, the monument appears quite homogeneous. During the design period, it changed from a conservative memorial column to a High Baroque scene, narrating a story in a theatrical form. The monument thus indicates the transition to the era of High Baroque in Vienna. It highly influenced the style and was imitated in the whole Austrian region. Iconography The column has a complex iconography, the basic message of which is that the plague and the Ottomans' Second Siege of Vienna (1683), both of them punishments for sin, were averted or defeated by the piety and intercession of the Emperor Leopold I. (The pillar thus also represents a (victory) monument to that emperor.) In the iconography, the Trinity expresses itself several times in the number three, namely vertically in three stages Thomas Winkelbauer: 1522-1699, Freedom of suffrage and prince power.

In addition, there is also a tripartite division in plan, which establishes a connection between the sacral program and the three parts of the Habsburg monarchy: # The western face is dedicated to God the Father and bears a double-headed eagle, the coat of arms of the Holy Roman Empire, as well as the coats of arms of the Inner Austrian lands, the duchies of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola. Between the western and eastern wings are the coats of arms for the core countries of the monarchy. # The eastern face is associated with the Son of God and bears the coats of arms of the kingdoms of Hungary, Croatia and Dalmatia, as well as Bosnia. #The northern face, which belongs to the Holy Spirit, is decorated with the coats of arms of the Kingdom of Bohemia, the Margraviate of Upper Lusatia and Lower Silesia, as well as the Duchy of Silesia.

The program ended in 2010 when the Americorps grant was not renewed. Northwest Service Academy ran from 1994, as an Americorps program in the inaugural year, to 2010. Northwest Service Academy partners with more than 250 schools, community-based organizations and government agencies to address significant environmental issues in the states of Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington. NWSA projects typically addressed critical environmental needs through hands-on environmental restoration, resource conservation, environmental education, environmental stewardship or volunteer programs. NWSA was located in the Pacific Northwest, one of the most environmentally rich corners of the Earth. The region abounds with natural wonders; from the snow-capped mountains of the Cascades to the rugged Pacific Ocean coast, from the remote outback of the high desert to the mystical waterfalls of the Columbia River Gorge. AmeriCorps Positions There are three types of positions in which AmeriCorps members could serve with NWSA: Leaders, Individual Placements, and Field Teams. A group of Individual Placement members enjoy a team building activity. A NWSA Field Team member does routine tool upkeep. =Leaders= Leaders played a dynamic role that requires a strong ethic of service, great communication skills, a desire to continually refine their leadership skills and the ability to balance the needs of team members, project sponsors and NWSA. Leaders were responsible for facilitating the creation of a strong and collaborative team, advocating for member needs, assisting NWSA staff with member-based issues, coordinating team meetings and trainings, and ensuring that the team completes all service related paperwork. Stewards and leaders usually served alongside their team, coordinating with sponsors to ensure that the team's service meets the project needs in a safe and effective manner. =Individual placements= Individual placements were placed with local schools, community-based organizations and government agencies. They were usually placed one per sponsoring organization and serve with that same sponsor for their entire term of service. NWSA projects were developed by project sponsors and selected through a competitive process. IP service activities varied from site to site, and generally focused on one or more of the following areas: restoring watersheds, enhancing public lands, conserving resources, increasing awareness through environmental education, increasing community stewardship and volunteerism, providing educational support, and strengthening communities. =Field teams= Field teams were made up of 4 -10 members and usually include a Leader. Team projects were based on the needs of the communities being served, and often involve collaborating with local watershed groups, government agencies, non-profit organizations, community groups and schools. Field team projects often had a restoration, environmental education or community revitalization focus, and could have involved activities such as wildlife habitat restoration, building riparian fences, trail building and rehabilitation, salmon habitat rehabilitation, planting trees in natural and urban areas, non-native species removal, public education and outreach, and community enhancement projects.

The bridge links the east bank of the river in the vicinity of Rodney Parade stadium to University Plaza on the west bank. It was the first major public project in Newport Unlimited's plans to regenerate the city. The bridge won a design award from the British Construction and Steelworkers Association; the George Gibby Award 2007 by the Institution of Civil Engineers in Wales; the regeneration award by The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in Wales as well as a highly commended by Wales Business Insider for the best regeneration project of 2007. Overview The bridge features two A-Frame masts, which support the bridge from the west bank. The masts are positioned on a shared foundation and anchored at ground level by two diameter cables that are connected the tips of the masts. The forward mast is long and the back mast is long. Because of the angle at which the masts are positioned, the bridge stands at above ground. The deck is wide and above water at high tide. The bridge has a clear span of .

The deliberate location of the main structures on the west bank means that the vast majority of the construction work was kept away from the houses on the east bank, while avoiding impact on the local river ecology. The foundations The bridge foundations are supported by thirty diameter CFA (continuous flight auger) piles varying in length. The bridge structure is suspended on five ground anchors which are drilled into the ground. Approximately of concrete were used in the bridge foundations. The masts The masts are made from sheet steel which was rolled into 'cans'. These were then welded together to produce the tubes for the masts. The front mast is in diameter and was delivered to site in nine sections. It weighs approximately . The back mast is diameter and was delivered to site in seven sections. It weighs approximately . The deck The bridge deck is made up of five sections. The deck units were installed in sequence and then welded together. Details of the deck units are shown below: *Deck one and five ** long ** wide ** weight *Deck two and four ** long ** wide (at the outriggers) ** weight *Deck three ** long ** wide (at the outriggers) ** weight The cables A half mile (800 m) of cable is used to support the bridge, varying in diameter from 2 in to 4¬æ in (to 50 to 120 mm), made by Bridon Ropes of Doncaster.

She made her first on-screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 5 December 2004. Storylines The death of her father left Alice Wilson alone on the family farm, trying to make ends meet. When vet Paddy Kirk was called to see to her chickens, he and wife Emily were horrified by the way she was living and befriended her ‚Äì soon she had temporarily moved in with them. Through Emily, Alice became friends with Sam Dingle, who shared her love of chickens and was equally socially-excluded. Feelings between Alice and Sam ran deep and when she decided to sell her farm to relocate to Norfolk, he was in turmoil. In fact, he was so distraught at the prospect of losing Alice that he threatened to kill himself, leaving Eric Pollard to talk him out of it. However, what had been the worst day of his life, became the best when Alice returned from auctioning her property and they kissed. While she prepared to leave, Alice asked Sam to join her and live together as a couple. Horrified at the prospect of leaving Emmerdale and his beloved family, Sam refused and Alice prepared to go to Norfolk alone. But, realising this was his son's chance at happiness, Zak gave Sam some sage advice and then drove him to the station in time to catch the train with Alice. For months the couple lived happily on their chicken farm, keeping the Dingles updated on how they were. One day, Sam returned to the Dingle home, acting strangely. A couple of weeks later, Alice appeared ‚Äì explaining that Sam had upped and left after she fell pregnant. Although his family were shocked Sam could be so callous, Alice understood that he was just freaked out about the prospect of being a dad and soon the couple were back on track. However, Sam had missed home and wanted to remain in Emmerdale with their family around them to help with the baby. Things were fine, but Alice soon began feeling ill. Tests confirmed that she had cancer but, in an effort to protect Sam, she lied and said she'd been given the all clear. After a few weeks, Dr. Adam Forsythe forced her to come clean, devastating Sam. To make matters worse, Alice was advised to terminate her pregnancy so she could start chemotherapy immediately but Alice had no intention of getting rid of her baby. Against all advice, she refused the termination and gave birth to baby Samson prematurely in January 2006. The birth left Alice very depressed as Samson was rushed to intensive care before she got a chance to bond with him. Sam did his best to keep the family together. Alice did a wing walk to raise money for charity. She shaved her head prior to starting chemotherapy so that she was in control of when she lost her hair. Alice's doctor told her the chemotherapy wasn't helping, so she stopped treatment. After several weeks of pain, in a dramatic euthanasia plot, Sam helped Alice die by giving her an overdose of morphine. Reception For her portrayal of Alice, Holden-Gill received a nomination for Most Popular Actress at the 12th National Television Awards. She later earned a nomination for Best Actress at the 2007 British Soap Awards. A columnist from the Sunday Mercury opined that Alice met a \\"dignified and heart-breaking end\\" and said that she was brave for refusing cancer treatment for the sake of her child. They praised Holden-Gill for the effort she put into the storyline, including befriending cancer sufferers and shaving her own head.

In the first six months of 2018 the paper had a daily circulation of 14,814, down 14% on the same period in 2017. Occasionally the newspaper includes special features which focus on a particular aspect of life in Nottingham. An example of this was the paper‚Äôs Muslims in Nottingham series in April 2007. This consisted of a week-long series of interviews and articles in both the newspaper and on the Evening Post website. They focused on Nottingham‚Äôs Muslim community, giving its members the opportunity to express their views of life in the city. History The first edition of The Evening Post was printed by Thomas Forman on 1 May 1878. It sold for ¬Ωd and consisted of four pages. In July 1963, the Posts main competitor, the Nottingham Evening News, closed and merged with the Post. Also, the city‚Äôs two morning papers, the Nottingham Guardian and the Nottingham Journal, were merged into The Guardian Journal. On 19 June 1973, a printing dispute began, causing a period of industrial turmoil in the company, and The Guardian Journal ceased publication on that day.Thoroton During the protracted dispute, some Post journalists launched their own newspaper, receiving moral support from Brian Clough, then manager of Nottingham Forest. Eventually, as the only remaining newspaper was the Nottingham Evening Post, which increasingly covered the whole day‚Äôs news, it was re-named the Nottingham Post from the beginning of July 2010.Post Archive One of the Posts stalwart journalists, Emrys Bryson, wrote a revue about Nottingham life called Owd Yer Tight, which ran at Nottingham's Theatre Royal. The Posts sister paper, the Nottinghamshire Weekly Guardian, published D. H. Lawrence's first short story. In March 1996 the Post was relaunched as a full-colour tabloid, although the Saturday edition had switched to the smaller paper size as far back as 1982. The Post was based at offices on Forman StreetCorner of South Sherwood Street and Forman Street in the centre of Nottingham until 1998 when the paper relocated to Castle Wharf House.Corner of Canal Street and Wilford Street It moved to Tollhouse Hill in the city centre in 2012.City Gate East on Tollhouse Hill In October 2011 printing moved from Derby to Birmingham. In 2012, Local World acquired the paper's owner Northcliffe Media from Daily Mail and General Trust.Daily Mail sells regional newspapers to Local World BBC News, 21 November 2012 Other publications As well as the main newspaper, the Post also published a weekly sports paper on a Saturday throughout the football season, The Football Post (no longer published) which included coverage of the two local Football League clubs, Nottingham Forest and Notts County, as well as coverage of local non- league football, cricket, ice hockey and rugby union. In addition to this, the Post also previously published Forest Fever, a weekly newspaper-style magazine dedicated to Nottingham Forest Football Club. Its weekly in-depth look at events at the City Ground featured interviews with players, former players, management and supporters. There is also a monthly Bygones paper (no longer published as a separate publication), which publishes features and stories on the history of Nottingham. Contributors Over the years, several Post journalists moved to Fleet Street. Among them were Robert Bolton of The Sun, Robert Stephens of the Evening Standard and John Marquis of Reuters and Thomson Newspapers, who later went on to become an author and editor of the Bahamas‚Äô best-selling daily, The Tribune. Marquis was also voted Provincial Journalist of the Year in the 1974 National Press Awards (now British Press Awards) and was for many years London Sports Editor and Chief Boxing Correspondent of the Thomson newspaper empire, covering many Mumammad Ali fights. The late political sketchwriter Frank Johnson (The Daily Telegraph and The Spectator) was briefly a Post journalist, while the music and sports writer Richard Williams trained on the Post in the 1960s. Another Post reporter, BBC regional broadcaster John Barsby, became president of the National Union of Journalists. Among the Posts more illustrious journalists of recent times was Duncan Hamilton, whose book about Brian Clough (Provided You Don't Kiss Me) was described by TV commentator John Motson as ‚Äúone of the best football books I‚Äôve ever read.‚Äù After 20 years on the Post, Hamilton became deputy editor of the Yorkshire Post.

In 1767, William Cadell, the original managing partner of the Carron Company, bought the Banton estate and its ironstone field. A church was built in Banton when Dr. Burns of Kilsyth encouraged Archibald Edmonstone, William Cadell, Daniel Lusk (of the paper mill) and William Campbell each to contribute 50 guineas to the scheme. The school and schoolmaster's house were built around the same time. The first preacher at the church was Mr. J. Lyon who became part of the Secession Church. Banton originally centred on at area known today as High Banton. Farming and mining were the main historic industries. Banton, formerly called Low Banton had a \\"lappet & muslin manufactory\\". J & P Wilson's weaving mill was opened in 1839 and lasted over 100 years. It is now the headquarters of J. B. Bennett Ltd. of Glasgow who also had a 19th century business. The coal field stretched from Croy to about north-east of Low Banton. Robert Rennie reported about 50 or 60 people working the mines in the 18th century. Other historical employers were a sickle work, a paper mill, and a brick and tile work. There was also a straw and mill board maker. Source of the Kelvin The Townhead Reservoir, also known as Banton Loch, is about west of the village. This was built as a feeder loch for the Forth and Clyde canal. A fishing club uses the loch; previously a boating club used it too. Historically Banton had two curling clubs but the loch is only safe in the severest winters. There has been some discussion about the source of the River Kelvin. Some mention Dullatur Bog as a source. A source close to the old Lammerknowes Farm has been photographed. It is south- east corner of the village. Nearby Kelvinhead takes its name as the source of Glasgow's river which joins the Clyde at Yorkhill Basin. Banton today The Swan Inn, Banton Situated in the heart of the village at the Cross. Banton Bowling Club The village is small, with few local amenities. It had a shop until 2011, but no post office since this closed in 2010. There remains a pub- restaurant: The Swan Inn. This was bought by People United for Banton (PUB) in 2017; they also secured ¬£740,000 National Lottery funding in 2018 to turn it into a community hub. The village also has a local primary school, a church and a bowling green. There are several businesses in the village. The A803 runs south of the village. This allows travel to Kilsyth and Glasgow to the west and runs past Linlithgow to the east although it provided access the M80 at Haggs long before then. The village is about due north-west of the Kelvinhead junction.

After his graduation, he taught Greek and education at Grundy College and in 1924 was ordained as a minister in the Christian Reformed Church. In 1926 he was appointed a professor at Calvin Theological Seminary. Schultze served ten years as president of the National Union of Christian Schools, beginning in 1930. Because of his skill as a teacher and his long-standing support for Christian education, Schultze was appointed Calvin College president in 1940. During Schultze's tenure, the enrollment at Calvin College sank as a result of World War II but rebounded quickly when the war was over. In 1949 Schultze oversaw the restructuring of the academic governance process and in 1950 he took part in the dedication of a new one million dollar science building on the Franklin campus. After resigning the college presidency due to ill health in 1951, he was appointed Professor Extraordinary at Calvin Theological Seminary. Today, the dormitory Schultze Hall at Calvin College is named in his honor. Schultze married Jeannette Ophof in 1920 and they had three children.

It is not known if TMB is carcinogenic and the evidence is contradictory: TMB is not mutagenic by the Ames test, and did not induce formation of tumors in a single-arm study of 24 rats. On that evidence, it has been used as a replacement for carcinogenic compounds such as benzidine and o-phenylenediamine.

He was the brother of Arnold Wall and Rowena Wall, later Rowena Seymour, Duchess of Somerset, and the uncle of Evelyn Seymour, 17th Duke of Somerset. Frank Wall died in Bournemouth, England on 19 May 1950.  Legacy  Wall is commemorated in the scientific names of five reptiles: Boiga ochracea walli, Bungarus sindanus walli, Cyrtodactylus walli, Dinodon rufozonatum walli, and Hypnale walli. Along with Malcolm Arthur Smith, Wall is acknowledged as one of the two most important pioneers in the study of Indian herpetology.

The construction of its facilities began on 5 November 1960 and the first production capacities were put into operation in 1963 to produce cast iron and coke, with production extending to cover other areas in the 1960s and 1970s. The company was privatised in 1999 - 71% of it was acquired for US$1 by Daru Metals (a Bulgarian owned company later to change its name to Finmetals Holdings). Most of Kremikovtzi AD's production was exported to the European Union, Turkey, some of the former Yugoslav countries, the United States and China. The profit was 120 million leva in 2003 and 80 million leva in 2004. However, bad management and other factors led to the company generating losses of more than BGN 200 million for 2005. In January 2005, Kremikovtzi AD acquired 70% of the LEMIND-FPL polyester-covered sheet iron factory in Leskovac, Serbia for ‚Ç¨1.4 million. The company also made another acquisition in April 2005, purchasing the Llamkos galvanised sheet iron factory in Vucitrn, Kosovo for ‚Ç¨4.15 million. Both plants were disposed of upon Kremikovtzi's takeover by Global Steel Holdings Limited (GSHL). In 2005 Valentin Zahariev and Kiril Zahariev sold 100% of Finmetals Holdings for US$110 million to GSHL, owned by Pramod Mittal, brother of the highly successful Lakshmi Mittal. Kremikovtzi is not related to the Arcelor Mittal group. The new management brought by GSHL has embarked on an investment program aiming to increase the product quality, reduce the production costs and widen the product range. The key focus of this was the finalisation of the new Continuous Caster and a new Converter. Both were finally put in full operation in November 2006, after being under construction for more than 15 years. In November 2006, the debt obligations of the company were subject to extreme price volatility as speculation mounted about the depth of commitment to the business by GHSL. Pramod Mittal, the company's owner, issued a statement to reassure investors of his ongoing interest in Kremikovtzi's success; but this was not sufficient to dampen the ongoing volatility of the debt price. At the beginning of December 2006, GSHL issued another statement, this time committing to inject cash into the business on an ongoing, quarterly basis. Mittal withdrew from the company a year or so later and the company was kept afloat by the socialist government, desperately seeking for a potential investor. All negotiations ultimately failed. Fuel and salaries were not being paid during that period, creating additional debts for the company. Since December 2008 the factory was virtually non-functioning, kept in a safe- standby mode. On May 15, 2009, gas supply (main fuel for the factory's operations) has been cut off, the coke production plant - one of the most controversial symbols of the company - has been shut down permanently. In 2011 the factory is sold to an SPV financed by First Investment Bank. Since then the terrain was partially cleared and opportunities for redevelopment are being sought.

He was born at Goatfell Estate, Kandapola, Sri Lanka where his father, Charles Reid Henry, managed tea estates. He was one of eleven children and was educated at home by his older sisters. He showed an early talent as an artist and obtained his first job as a draughtsman and a laboratory assistant in the Ceylon Company of Pearl Fishers in 1907 at the age of 16. In 1910 he became a draughtsman at the Colombo Museum and was trained by Dr. Joseph Pearson, Director of the Colombo Museum, who was a zoologist and marine biologist. In July 1913 he was promoted to the newly created post of Assistant in Systematic Entomology at the Colombo Museum, a post he held until his retirement in 1946. George Henry married Olive Hobday in September 1917. His elder son, Bruce Charles Reid Henry, was born on 22 July 1918 and his younger son David Morrison Reid Henry was born on 14 September 1919. Both sons inherited George's talent for drawing and David (who died in Zimbabwe in 1977) became a fine bird and wildlife artist. Olive died in 1969. Publications * Henry, G. M. 1915.

He is probably best known for his Golden Boy manga series, which debuted in 1992. Egawa is known for his drawings of over-the-top facial expressions always crediting the staff of his creations, even on the covers (crediting the works to \\"Egawa and his assistants\\"). K≈çsuke Fujishima, who is known as the creator of Oh My Goddess was once one of Egawa's assistants. Early life Egawa was born in Chikusa- ku, Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture, Japan. He has a degree in mathematics and taught junior high mathematics for five months before transitioning into the manga industry.  Career  Egawa moved to Tokyo to work under manga artist Hiroshi Motomiya for four months in 1983. His big break came when his story \\"Don't Give Up\\" won Comic Morning's open contest. His first serialized series was Be Free! for Comic Morning, where he was recommended by Hiroshi. Egawa has cited manga artists Go Nagai and Shigeru Mizuki as influences. = Directing = He has also written and directed live-action pornographic films. In 2003 he started an association with the Japanese adult video (AV) studio Soft On Demand (SOD) under its president Ganari Takahashi. His first video with the company, , was released August 8, 2003 as SOD production SDDM-311, and marked the AV debut of actress Reika Yoshizawa. His second work for SOD, (SDDM-336), starring Ai Kurosawa, came out in October 2003. A third video, released in February 2004, (SDDM-404), with actress Shizuku Tsukino, contained some bondage elements. In 2006, Egawa directed his first live-action film, Tokyo University Story, based on his manga of the same name. The film, produced by SOD, was released theatrically in Japan in February 2006.

Plot summary Brother Fish is a story spanning four continents and eighty years though the story primarily takes place in Australia and Korea. The story deals with the friendship of Jacko McKenzie, a native of the (fictional) Queen's Island in the Bass Strait, and James ‚ÄòJimmy‚Äô Pentecost Oldcorn, an orphan American ex-soldier, who have been meeting at the Gallipoli Bar of the ANZAC Hotel, Launceston, Tasmania for 33 years, since their release from a prisoner of war camp in Korea. In the bar, Jacko reminisces back to his youth on Queen's Island, of the poverty, being the son of a fisherman and a washerwoman, and the characters inhabiting his home town. One of the defining points of Jacko's life was his first encounter with Miss Nicole Lenoir- Jourdan, town librarian and indomitable justice of the peace. The librarian would go on to fundamentally influence Jacko's life, starting with additional English lessons during his formative years, as a friend, and ultimately as a business partner. A key feature of the novel is Jacko's recounting of his army days, first as an infantryman who did not see service in World War II (on account of joining up too late), and most importantly, those spent in Korea. It was during this spell that Jacko met Jimmy, an American soldier, and care is taken to delve into the background of the latter. Following their release, the lads return to Queen's Island, where, Jimmy is a big hit with the local girls. During the brief stopover in Launceston, Jacko meets Wendy, the daughter of a local doctor, and ex-finance of one of Jacko's comrades, sadly fallen in Korea and the two eventually marry. As Jacko and Jimmy set about rebuilding their lives, ideally based on starting their own fishing business, they turn to the domineering Miss Lenoir-Jourdan once more. Her own chequered past as a Russian √©migr√©, first to Shanghai, and later on to Australia via Hong Kong, following a dramatic fallout with a Chinese Triad boss is described in detail, and ultimately rounds out the novel. The story concludes with Jimmy and Jacko enjoying their pint in the ANZAC, before going to say their final goodbyes to an old and dear friend, who is dying.  Major themes  Aspects of the Korean War are major theme of the first third of the book - in particular its status as \\"the forgotten war\\", the poor performance of United States troops, the brutality of the South Korean regime of Syngman Rhee, and the crimes against POWs. Another common theme throughout the novel, is music, specifically the mouth organ, at which Jacko and his entire family are rather adept at playing. Jimmy repeatedly reminds Jacko that it is this music that quite possibly saved both of them from almost certain death in Korea. The novel explores the White Australia policy, by way of Jimmy's problems encountered whilst trying to secure permanent residency in Australia. In similar vein, repeated mention is made of Australia's own dark racist history, with the aboriginal population being regarded as very much second class.

It was originally transmitted on Monday 27 December 1971. Synopsis After being insulted by Captain Square for his lack of medals, Captain Mainwaring challenges the Eastgate platoon to a test of strength and stamina to prove who commands the better platoon. Plot While Jones and the rest of the platoon hold a bayonet practice, Mainwaring and Wilson discuss the upcoming Ceremonial church parade of all the Home Guard platoons in the area. Mainwaring receives a new officer's cap in the post and hangs it on a nail on the door. Unfortunately, while charging at a dummy of Adolf Hitler, Pike bayonets the door, and subsequently punctures Mainwaring's new hat. Mainwaring is incensed and shouts at Pike, while Wilson receives a telephone call from Mrs Mainwaring. He hands the phone to Mainwaring, claiming she heard him shouting. Mainwaring is forced to leave the parade to put back the bedding in the air-raid shelter, leaving Wilson in charge. Captain Square arrives, and compliments Jones on his impressive row of medals. He goes into the office and confronts Wilson about a note he sent about the church parade, which stated that all medals should be worn. Wilson finds the note hidden under some other papers, and Square surmises that the reason he hid the letter is because Mainwaring hasn't got any medals, and he didn't want to feel out of place. Square orders Wilson to read the letter to the platoon. Next parade, Mainwaring inspects the men, and is shocked to see that they are all wearing their medals (except for Pike who has been forced, by his mum, to wear his Scout badges instead!). He riles Wilson about the unimportance of medals, and is even more disgusted when he learns that Chief ARP Warden Hodges, the Vicar and the Verger also have medals. After the church parade, Square irks Mainwaring by saying that his platoon are too old to be of any real use. Mainwaring responds by claiming that his platoon could wipe the floor with his any day, because they're fitter, better trained and better led, and insults Square by saying that he has a Colonel Blimp mentality. Square is angered and says that Mainwaring should prove that or apologise, and the Colonel suggests some initiative tests to settle the argument. Both Square and Mainwaring accept the challenge. Hodges, the Vicar and the Verger volunteer to be umpires. Once they receive the details of the test, Mainwaring convenes a parade to discuss their plan of action. Walker tells Mainwaring that he has made separate flags for both platoons to fly at the top of a tower, to mark the end of the test. Frazer foresees a snag: while they're performing the test, Godfrey will still be trying to climb out of Jones' van, and suggests that he breaks his leg to avoid going on the test, but Jones suggests that they carry Godfrey the way the natives carried Dr. Livingstone in Africa. Mainwaring agrees. As the first part of the test, a race between the two platoon vans to the site of the initiative tests, gets underway, Jones suffers an attack of malaria and Frazer recommends quinine, but Godfrey only has tonic wine in his Red Cross bag. As they set off, they realise they have been travelling in a circle, and the Eastgate van is catching them up. Mainwaring tries to stall them by swerving all over the road, but Hodges stops them, allowing the Eastgate platoon to get ahead. However, their van breaks down and Mainwaring's platoon resume their lead. To stall the Eastgate platoon, Mainwaring decides to release some sheep onto the road, but they eventually end up blocking the Walmington-on-Sea platoon. They eventually come to a halt on a bridge, with the Eastgate platoon approaching from one direction and the Walmington platoon arriving from the other. Neither commander is willing to back down, so both platoons get out and push their respective vehicles. Hodges arrives and is accidentally pushed into the river by Wilson. Mainwaring and Square rush to help, but tell their respective Sergeants to let down the enemy's tyres, leaving them both stranded. After they arrive, the first initiative test begins, which involves puncturing balloons with bayonets. The Eastgate platoon take the early lead, mainly thanks to a drunken Corporal Jones. However, Walker and Godfrey use their initiative by using a cigarette and a safety pin respectively. The final balloon floats away out of reach, but Mainwaring shoots it and they quickly rush off. The second initiative test begins, which involves carrying feathers from a tank to three barrels. Many ideas are suggested, but Pike comes up trumps by suggesting that they carry the barrels to the tank, and fill them up from there. This works, and gives them a huge advantage. Hodges attempts to stifle the platoon's effort by pulling the plug out of one of the boats they must use to cross the river, but Mainwaring and the platoon choose the other boat, leaving Hodges fuming. He rows over in a dinghy to fetch another boat, but it's revealed that Sergeant Parkins, of the Eastgate platoon, had removed the plug from the dinghy and tested it for the plugless boat, and Hodges ends up in the water again. The platoon pass successfully through a battlefield, and successfully fire five rounds at the target, leaving them with just the flag to fly at the top of the tower, with still a huge margin for victory. However, their plans are temporarily scuppered when Mainwaring inadvertently pulls the rope off the flag pole. A still drunken Jones bravely, and successfully, shins along the pole and secures the rope again. However, he suffers another attack of malaria, giving the Eastgate platoon the opening they need to fly their flag. But Frazer notes that it's the Walmington platoon's flag they're flying, and Square is irate. The Walmington platoon have won! The Eastgate platoon leave the tower in a huff, and Wilson prepares to chuck the Eastgate flag over the parapet, but Walker stops him. Mainwaring is shocked to learn that both flags are theirs. Walker offers up an excuse, but Mainwaring sees through him, knowing he did it on purpose. However, he is prepared to let him off because they won the contest.

The concept actually aims at understanding the processes by defining their CPPs, and accordingly monitoring them in a timely manner (preferably in-line or on- line) and thus being more efficient in testing while at the same time reducing over-processing, enhancing consistency and minimizing rejects. The FDA has outlined a regulatory frameworkFDA, Guidance for industry: PAT ‚Äì A framework for innovative pharmaceutical development, manufacturing and quality assurance; September 2004 for PAT implementation. With this framework ‚Äì according to HinzHinz, Process analytical technologies in the pharmaceutical industry: the FDA's PAT initiative; Anal Bioanal Chem, Vol 384, p1036-1042, 2006 ‚Äì the FDA tries to motivate the pharmaceutical industry to improve the production process. Because of the tight regulatory requirements and the long development time for a new drug, the production technology is \\"frozen\\" at the time of conducting phase-2 clinical trials. Generally, the PAT initiative from FDA is only one topic within the broader initiative of \\"Pharmaceutical cGMPs for the 21st century ‚Äì A risk based approach\\".FDA, Pharmaceutical cGMPs for the 21st century ‚Äì A risk based approach; Final Report, September 2004 The basics PAT is a term used for describing a broader change in pharmaceutical manufacturing from static batch manufacturing to a more dynamic approach. It involves defining the Critical Process Parameters (CPPs) of the equipment used to make the product, which affect the Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) of the product and then controlling these CPPs within defined limits. This allows manufacturers to produce products with consistent quality and also helps to reduce waste & overall costs. This mechanism for producing consistent product quality & reducing waste presents a good case for utilising continuous manufacturing technologies. The control of a steady state process when you understand the upstream & downstream effects is an easier task as common cause variability is easier to define and monitor. The variables It would be acceptable to consider that raw materials used to manufacture pharmaceutical products can vary in their attributes e.g. moisture content, crystal structure etc. It would also be acceptable to consider that manufacturing equipment does not always operate in exactly the same fashion due to the inherent tolerance of the equipment and its components. It is therefore logical to say that variability in raw materials married with a static batch process with inherent variability in process equipment produces variable product. This is on the basis that a static batch process produces product by following a fixed recipe with fixed set-points. With this in mind the PAT drive is to have a dynamic manufacturing process that compensates for variability both in raw materials & equipment to produce a consistent product. PAT implementation The challenge to date with PAT for pharmaceutical manufacturers is knowing how to start. A common problem is picking a complex process and getting mired in the challenge of collecting and analyzing the data. The following criteria serve as a basic framework for successful PAT roll-outs: (From A PAT Primer) * Picking a simple process. (Think water for injection (WFI) or building monitoring system (BMS) * All details and nuances are well understood and explained for that process. * Determine what information is easily collected and accessible through current instrumentation. * Understanding the appropriate intervals for collecting that data. * Evaluating the tools available for reading and synchronizing the data. PAT tools In order to implement a successful PAT project, a combination of three main PAT tools is essential: * Multivariate data acquisition and data analysis tools: usually advanced software packages which aid in design of experiments, collection of raw data and statistically analyzing this data in order to determine what parameters are CPP. * Process analytical chemistry (PAC) tools: in-line and on-line analytical instruments used to measure those parameters that have been defined as CPP. These include mainly near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS); but also include biosensors, Raman spectroscopy, fiber optics and others. * Continuous improvement and/or knowledge management tools: paper systems or software packages which accumulate Quality Control data acquired over time for specific processes with the aim of defining process weaknesses and implementing and monitoring process improvement initiatives. These products may be the same or separated from the statistical analysis tools above. Long-term goals The long-term goals of PAT are to: * reduce production cycling time * prevent rejection of batches * enable real time release * increase automation and control * improve energy and material use * facilitate continuous processing Currently NIR spectroscopy applications dominate the PAT projects. A possible next-generation solution is Energy Dispersive X-Ray Diffraction (EDXRD).Williams, J: Healthcare Distributor, December 2006/January 2007, page 81. Colorado, United States: E.L.F. Publications, Inc. For a detailed review of PAT tools see Scott, or Roggo. For an example of application see Gendre. Although the FDA's PAT initiative encourages process control based on the real-time acquired data, a small part of PAT applications goes beyond monitoring the processes and follows the PACT (‚ÄòProcess Analytically Controlled Technology‚Äô) approach. MVA in PAT Fundamental to process analytical technology (PAT) initiatives are the basics of multivariate analysis (MVDA) and design of experiments (DoE). This is because analysis of the process data is a key to understand the process and keep it under multivariate statistical control.

It was written by Bone creator Jeff Smith and illustrated by Charles Vess, who earned an Eisner nomination for his work on it. The story was originally published as a three-issue miniseries and was later included in both trade paperback and hardcover collections. It takes place when Rose Harvestar was a young woman, before her rise to the Atheian throne. Plot The prologue tells the story of how the world was created by a powerful dragon named Mim, who maintained peace and created powerful dreams. She was possessed by the powerful Lord of the Locusts, driving her mad and leading the other dragons to seal her, as well as the Lord of the Locusts, away in stone. Rose, the youngest of the two sisters, is being trained to be a Veni-Yan-Cari (an \\"Awakened One\\"). Her mastery of the Dreaming Arts, a talent possessed by nearly everyone in her family except her older sister Briar, is renowned throughout the Valley. She sets off for Old Man's Cave to take her final exam with Briar, Lucius, the Captain of the Guards, and her two dogs, whom Rose can understand and talk to. It is clear that Rose is falling for Lucius and that he reciprocates her feelings, but he behaves oddly around Briar. The Red Dragon appears and meets with the headmaster to alert him that the River Dragon has gone rogue. On the way, Rose gets her \\"gitchy feeling\\" (a manifestation of her dreaming arts), alerting her that something is wrong. She then dreams about freeing a dragon from a river. The next day, Rose encounters the Red Dragon, who orders her to go to her headmaster. On the way, she is attacked by locusts and then by Balsaad, the River Dragon she freed in her dream. She cuts off his hand, but it suddenly reattaches. Balsaad flees and Rose describes the ordeal and her dream to Briar, who asks her to not tell the Order about it. Rose goes after Balsaad once more and is told by the Red Dragon how to defeat it - at a price. She must take Balsaad to the river where she freed it, kill him, and then kill the next living thing she sees. Meanwhile, Lucius then leads the Veni-Yan-Cari in battle with the rat creatures, who are being led by a mysterious new master to take back the valley. As Rose leads Balsaad back to the river, she is knocked out and has a dream. It is revealed that Briar is Balsaad's new master and the one who led the rat creatures to the valley. The Lord of the Locusts has discovered Briar's hidden hatred of her sister, inspired by jealousy of the powers Briar would never have as a dreamer and future queen, and has taken advantage of it through her dreams. Rose is about to be killed by the Lord of the Locusts, but Briar stops him, as she wants to be the one to kill her. She then wakes up and kills Balsaad by chopping him up and his body parts are washed away by the river's current, and then Briar appears at almost the same time as one of her dogs. She has aged as punishment for defying the Locust King and begs Rose not to kill her, thus Rose kills her dog rather than Briar. She brings Briar back to the valley and bursts into tears when her other dog asks where its companion is. Later, the people of the valley cheer her victory while the Red Dragon looks on disapprovingly. Characters Rose, Briar, Mim, the Lord of the Locusts, Lucius Down and, in the original series, the bartender at the Barrelhaven Tavern, have significant roles. The rat creatures, monsters for which Bone is well known, also make an appearance, though the ones that have individual personalities in Bone do not appear in Rose. The Veni-Yan, a benevolent religious order, also make a return appearance. The only characters in Rose that do not appear in Bone are Rose's two talking dogs, whom only she can understand. In Bone flashbacks, Briar looks a little older than Rose. In Rose, however, Briar ages for failing the Lord of the Locusts. Balsaad and the Lambton Worm It appears that the whole plot of Balsaad, the way to defeat him, and Rose's choosing to kill her dog instead of Briar are all influenced by the legend of Lambton Worm from north-east England. The Lambton Worm regenerated itself by reattaching body parts that were cut off. It was defeated in the River Wear when John Lambton cut it into pieces that washed away. A witch or wise woman had told Lambton that he must kill the first living thing he saw after defeating the worm. Lambton saw his father first, but instead killed the hound that he saw second.

The bay was named by George Bass, for its shape of two bights. The northern bight is called Calle Calle Bay; while the southern bight is known as Nullica Bay. The bay is also known for the \\"Killers of Eden\\", the killer whales that helped a group of whalers in their search for other whales. The best-known of these was Old Tom, whose skeleton is preserved in Eden's local museum. Location and features Located near the town of Eden, Twofold Bay is approximately to the north of the border between Victoria and New South Wales. The bay is fed from the Nullica River and Towamba River that both flow into Nullica Bay. The catchment area of the bay is with a volume of over a surface area of , at an average depth of ; making the bay reputedly the third deepest natural harbour in the Southern Hemisphere. Close to North Head is a conspicuous islet, Mewstone Rock. About south of the islet is Red Point which forms the southern headland of the bay. Eden and the Port of Eden are located in the bay. The historical town of Boydtown is located to the west of the bay, located on Boydtown Beach which stretches south from the mouth of the Nullica River. Local waters including Twofold Bay is recognized as one of twelve coastal aggregation areas for southern right whales in Australia. History A view of the bay from Eden. =Indigenous history= The original inhabitants of the area surrounding Twofold Bay were Aborigines of the Thaua clan of the Yuin nation. =European history= The first recorded visit to the bay by a European was by George Bass. The diaries of Bass show that he noted the bay when he passed it on his whaleboat voyage to Bass Strait in 1797/8. Bass took shelter in the bay on the return journey in February 1798; and named the place where he sheltered \\"Snug Cove\\", a name by which the bay is still known. On 7 October 1798 Bass and Matthew Flinders set out from Port Jackson in the Norfolk on a voyage to determine whether or not Van Diemen's Land (now called Tasmania) was attached to the mainland of Australia. Accompanying them on this voyage was the Nautilus. Two days later a survey of Twofold Bay was commenced. This very accurate survey has required little subsequent modification apart from the addition of water depths and of shore-to-shore distances between important landmarks. Bass and Flinders also made their first contact with the local Thaua people. The bay is mentioned in the logs of many ships which sheltered in it from the storms battering that part of the New South Wales coastline. Some of these ships were shipwrecked in the bay including the George (1805) and the Mary (1821).Bateson, Charles (1982) Australian shipwrecks: Volume One; 1622-1850, Sydney, Reed, pp. 41‚Äì2 & 61\\\\. Quarantine Bay, located south of Eden, is so named because a sailing ship with a smallpox epidemic amongst the people on board took refuge in this (then) isolated area. Many people died and were buried on shore in a communal grave. In 1843 Benjamin Boyd purchased land in Twofold Bay with the aim of transporting cattle from the district. Soon afterwards, Boyd started to build the Seahorse Inn adjacent to what is now called Boydtown Beach. Boydtown Beach lies on the western shore of Twofold Bay just south of the entrance to the Nullica River, which is located at the southern end of Quarantine Bay. The Seahorse Inn is still used for tourist accommodation. Nearby are the ruins of the church which Ben Boyd had constructed. Boyd conducted pastoral, whaling and shipping activities at Boydtown. In popular culture Sir Oswald Brierly, Whalers off Twofold Bay, New South Wales (1867) (Art Gallery of New South Wales) Artist Oswald Brierly managed a bay whaling operation at Boyd Town in the 1840s and while there he did a number of paintings and sketches of the bay.Diamond, Marion (1988) The Seahorse and the Wanderer: Ben Boyd in Australia, Melbourne University Press, p. 99\\\\. He did a few more paintings of the area after his return to Britain. Evening: A scene in Boyd Town, Twofold Bay, is the title of a poem by Thomas Fennell, RN, that appeared in a New South Wales literary journal in 1847.‚ÄúEvening ...\\", Heads of the People: an illustrated journal of literature, whims and oddities, 1 (21) September 4, 1847, p. 149 Twofold Bay is the name, and subject, of a poem by E.J. BradyBrady, E.J. (1933) Wardens of the sea, Sydney, Endeavour Press, pp. 22‚Äì24 Will Lawson's book In Ben Boyd's day (1939) is set in the bay, as is Shirley Barrett's novel Rush Oh! (2015) which offers a fictionalised account of the family of whaler George Davidson at Eden. The history of whaling in the bay, and the role Killer Whales in that process, is the focus of the Eden Killer Whale Museum. Industry In the mid-2000s two major wharves dominate the south-eastern section of the bay. The most easterly wharf services the woodchip mill. Usually two ships per month use the wharf. The forestry industry plays a significant role in the region. The Eden woodchip mill is owned by South East Fibre Exports (SEFE), a subsidiary of Japan's biggest paper manufacturer, Nippon Paper Industries. The mill processes whole tree logs and is unable to process waste wood. The Eden chipmill was Australia's first chipmill and has been vigorously opposed by conservationists for over forty years. Some conservationists argue that woodchipping not only kills millions of native animals and birds, it is a major contributor to climate change. The second wharf belongs to the Department of Defence and is used by the Royal Australian Navy to service its ships. Parallel to the woodchip mill is a naval munitions storage depot. It is a multi-purpose wharf which allows other vessels, including cruise ships, to also moor at the wharf when the Naval ships are not using it. Mussel farming occupies the westerly part of the bay off the small peninsula between Cattle Bay and Quarantine Bay. See also * Coast to Kosciuszko, an ultramarathon race.

From 1991 to 2002, she served as Woman of the Bedchamber to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. Early life and education Born Margaret Elphinstone in Westminster, London, Rhodes was the youngest daughter of the 16th Lord Elphinstone and his wife, Lady Mary Bowes-Lyon, an elder sister of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. Less than a year older than the future queen, she was a frequent playmate of the young Princess Elizabeth. During the Second World War she lived at Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace, and took a secretarial course. On 20 November 1947, she was a bridesmaid to Princess Elizabeth at her wedding to Philip Mountbatten, Duke of Edinburgh. Career During World War II, she worked as a secretary for MI6. She was a Woman of the Bedchamber ‚Äì a mix of lady-in-waiting and companion ‚Äì to her aunt, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, from 1991 until the latter's death in 2002. In the 2000 Birthday Honours Rhodes was appointed Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order (LVO). She lived in the Garden House, a grace and favour residence in Windsor Great Park. In the run-up to the Queen's 80th birthday in April 2006, Rhodes gave an interview to the BBC in which she stated her belief that the Queen would not abdicate. Her autobiography, The Final Curtsey, was published in 2011. She was the \\"castaway\\" on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs on 3 June 2012. Rhodes appeared in seven documentaries about her first cousin Queen Elizabeth II. On 27 November 2016, Buckingham Palace confirmed that Rhodes had died, aged 91, on 25 November following a short illness. Personal life On 31 July 1950, she married the writer Denys Gravenor Rhodes (1919‚Äì1981), with Princess Margaret as one of the bridesmaids. The couple had four children and one grandson: *Annabel Margaret Rhodes (born 21 February 1952); she married Christopher James Downing Strickland-Skailes in 1978. They have one son. She remarried (Geoffrey Vallack) Charles Cope in 1986 **Andrew James Downing Strickland-Skailes (born 1980) *Victoria Ann Rhodes (born 27 September 1953), a goddaughter of Queen Elizabeth II; married Nicholas Deans in 1974 *Simon John Gravenor Rhodes (born 22 February 1957), a godson of Princess Margaret; married Susan Simon in 1983 *Michael Andrew Gravenor Rhodes (born 8 June 1960) Ancestry Having been a first cousin to Elizabeth II, Rhodes shared half her ancestry with the Queen, including several notable peers.

These blocks convert data between serial data and parallel interfaces in each direction. The term \\"SerDes\\" generically refers to interfaces used in various technologies and applications. The primary use of a SerDes is to provide data transmission over a single line or a differential pair in order to minimize the number of I/O pins and interconnects. Generic function Shows the principle of a SerDes The basic SerDes function is made up of two functional blocks: the Parallel In Serial Out (PISO) block (aka Parallel-to-Serial converter) and the Serial In Parallel Out (SIPO) block (aka Serial-to-Parallel converter). There are 4 different SerDes architectures: (1) Parallel clock SerDes, (2) Embedded clock SerDes, (3) 8b/10b SerDes, (4) Bit interleaved SerDes. The PISO (Parallel Input, Serial Output) block typically has a parallel clock input, a set of data input lines, and input data latches. It may use an internal or external phase-locked loop (PLL) to multiply the incoming parallel clock up to the serial frequency. The simplest form of the PISO has a single shift register that receives the parallel data once per parallel clock, and shifts it out at the higher serial clock rate. Implementations may also make use of a double-buffered register to avoid metastability when transferring data between clock domains. The SIPO (Serial Input, Parallel Output) block typically has a receive clock output, a set of data output lines and output data latches. The receive clock may have been recovered from the data by the serial clock recovery technique. However, SerDes which do not transmit a clock use reference clock to lock the PLL to the correct Tx frequency, avoiding low harmonic frequencies present in the data stream. The SIPO block then divides the incoming clock down to the parallel rate. Implementations typically have two registers connected as a double buffer. One register is used to clock in the serial stream, and the other is used to hold the data for the slower, parallel side. Some types of SerDes include encoding/decoding blocks. The purpose of this encoding/decoding is typically to place at least statistical bounds on the rate of signal transitions to allow for easier clock recovery in the receiver, to provide framing, and to provide DC balance. =Parallel clock SerDes= Parallel clock SerDes is normally used to serialize a parallel bus input along with data address & control signals. The serialized stream is sent along with a reference clock. The clock jitter tolerance at the serializer is 5‚Äì10 ps rms. =Embedded clock SerDes= An embedded clock SerDes serializes data and clock into a single stream. One cycle of clock signal is transmitted first, followed by the data bit stream; this creates a periodic rising edge at the start of the data bit stream. As the clock is explicitly embedded and can be recovered from the bit stream, the serializer (transmitter) clock jitter tolerance is relaxed to 80‚Äì120 ps rms, while the reference clock disparity at the deserializer can be ¬±50000 ppm (i.e. 5%). =8b/10b SerDes= 8b/10b SerDes maps each data byte to a 10-bit code before serializing the data. The deserializer uses the reference clock to monitor the recovered clock from the bit stream. As the clock information is synthesized into the data bit stream, rather than explicitly embedding it, the serializer (transmitter) clock jitter tolerance is to 5‚Äì10 ps rms and the reference clock disparity at the deserializer is ¬±100 ppm. A common coding scheme used with SerDes is 8b/10b encoding. This supports DC-balance, provides framing, and guarantees frequent transitions. The guaranteed transitions allow a receiver to extract the embedded clock. The control codes allow framing, typically on the start of a packet. The typical 8b/10b SerDes parallel side interfaces have one clock line, one control line and 8 data lines. Such serializer-plus-8b/10b encoder, and deserializer-plus-decoder blocks are defined in the Gigabit Ethernet specification. Another common coding scheme used with SerDes is 64b/66b encoding. This scheme statistically delivers DC-balance and transitions through the use of a scrambler. Framing is delivered through the deterministic transitions of the added framing bits. Such serializer-plus-64b/66b encoder and deserializer-plus-decoder blocks are defined in the 10 Gigabit Ethernet specification. The transmit side comprises a 64b/66b encoder, a scrambler, and a gearbox that converts the 66b signal to a 16-bit interface. Another serializer then converts this 16-bit interface into a fully serial signal. =Bit interleaved SerDes= Bit interleaved SerDes multiplexes several slower serial data streams into faster serial streams, and the receiver demultiplexes the faster bit streams back to slower streams. Standardization of SerDes The Optical Internetworking Forum (OIF) has published the Common Electrical I/O (CEI) Interoperability Agreements (IAs), that have defined five generations of the electrical interface of SerDes, at 3.125, 6, 10, 28 and 56 Gb/s. The OIF has announced new projects at 112 Gb/s. The OIF also published three earlier generations of electrical interfaces. These IAs have been adopted or adapted or have influenced high speed electrical interfaces defined by IEEE 802.3, Infiniband, RapidIO, Fibre Channel and numerous other bodies.

It provides services to its members such as: * Regulatory issues covering pilot training, licensing and airworthiness handled under the delegations from the government regulatory body (CASA) * Liaison with government agencies (such as Airservices Australia, particularly in terms of that organisation's airspace management responsibilities * Liaison with other sporting and recreational aviation bodies on matters of mutual interest (e.g. through Australian Sport Aviation Confederation) * Arranging and managing liability insurance coverage for all members and clubs * Awarding badges and managing Australian gliding records * Encouraging and staging competitions at the national and international level * Technical matters * Promotion of gliding * Liaison with international gliding organisations (such as OSTIV and the FAI) * Publishing a magazine Soaring Australia In Australia, glider pilots are exempt from holding pilot licences but the GFA is responsible for the establishment of pilot certificates. These are regarded highly enough by CASA and the aviation industry to be considered as a satisfactory substitute for licences. Australian glider pilots wishing to fly gliders in other countries can convert their GFA Glider Pilot Certificates to CASA‚Äìissued (and ICAO compliant) Glider Pilot Licences. As the inclusion of 'federation' in the name suggests, the GFA is a tiered structure based on regional associations, which are in turn based on gliding clubs. It is only possible to be a member of the GFA if one is also a member of a gliding club which is affiliated to the GFA through the applicable regional association.

The cluster or block size remains at a constant number of sectors after being initialized during the formatting of the filesystem. In general, most operating systems try to store the data in a contiguous way so as to minimize data fragmentation. The seek time of mechanical drives is significant for writing and reading data to/from a hard disk, so that is why it is important to keep the fragmentation to a minimum level. When a file is deleted, the meta-information about this file (filename, date/time, size, location of the first data block/cluster, etc.) is lost; e.g., in an ext3/ext4 filesystem, the names of deleted files are still present, but the location of the first data block is removed. This means the data is still present on the filesystem, but only until some or all of it is overwritten by new file data. To recover these \\"lost\\" files, PhotoRec first tries to find the data block (or cluster) size. If the filesystem is not corrupted, this value can be read from the superblock (ext2/ext3/ext4) or volume boot record (FAT, NTFS). Otherwise, PhotoRec reads the media, sector by sector, searching for the first ten files, from which it calculates the block/cluster size from their locations. Once this block size is known, PhotoRec reads the media block by block (or cluster by cluster). Each block is checked against a signature database; which comes with the program and has been growing in the type of files it can recover ever since PhotoRec's first version came out. It is a common data recovery method called file carving. For example, PhotoRec identifies a JPEG file when a block begins with: * Start Of Image + APP0: 0xff, 0xd8, 0xff, 0xe0 * Start Of Image + APP1: 0xff, 0xd8, 0xff, 0xe1 * or Start Of Image + Comment: 0xff, 0xd8, 0xff, 0xfe If PhotoRec has already started to recover a file, it stops its recovery, checks the consistency of the file when possible and starts to save the new file (which it determined from the signature it found). If the data is not fragmented, the recovered file should be identical to (or possibly larger than) the original file in size. In some cases, PhotoRec can learn the original file size from the file header, so the recovered file is truncated to the correct size. If, however, the recovered file ends up being smaller than its header specifies, it is discarded. Some files, such as *.MP3 types, are data streams. In this case, PhotoRec parses the recovered data, then stops the recovery when the stream ends. When a file is recovered successfully, PhotoRec checks the previous data blocks to see whether a file signature was found but the file was not able to be successfully recovered (i.e., the file was too small), and it tries again. This way, some fragmented files can be successfully recovered.How PhotoRec works (Description from the author website).  Distribution  PhotoRec and TestDisk are shipped together.

The original grant was for construction and operation of a tokamak reactor Alcator A, the first in a series of small, high-field tokamaks, followed by Alcator C (1978) and Alcator C-Mod (1993). MIT's most recent tokamak, Alcator C-Mod, ran from 1993 to 2016. In 2016, the project pressure reached 2.05 atmospheres‚Äîa 15 percent jump over the previous record of 1.77 atmospheres with a plasma temperature of 35 million degrees C, sustaining fusion for 2 seconds, yielding 600 trillion fusion reactions. The run involved a 5.7 tesla magnetic field. It reached this milestone on its final day of operation. In 2018, the PSFC began developing a conceptual design for the SPARC tokamak in collaboration with Commonwealth Fusion Systems. SPARC intends to use new YBCO superconducting magnets in order to achieve net fusion energy in a compact device.

Background  Noarlunga Meat Ltd was charged with contravening the Metropolitan and Export Abattoirs Act 1936 (SA), s 52a, because it did not hold a State licence for slaughtering stock. All premises outside the metropolitan area \\"for the purpose of slaughtering stock for export as fresh meat in a chilled or frozen condition\\" were required to obtain a licence from the State Agriculture Minister. However, the defendant company was registered under the Commerce (Meat Export) Regulations (Cth). Regulation 4B prohibited the exportation of meat unless an export permit had been granted, and regulation 5 required that all premises used for the slaughter of meat to be registered. The defendant company argued that the State act was invalid by virtue of inconsistency with the Commonwealth regulations, which is dealt with in s 109 of the Constitution.  Decision  = Trade and commerce power = The Commonwealth has the power to make laws with respect to \\"trade and commerce with other countries, and among the States\\", as per s 51(i) of the Constitution. This power authorises the prohibition of the export of certain commodities, and by extension the prohibition of commodities with certain restrictions. Regulation 4B is therefore within its power. Regulation 5 does not fall under the direct head of power. Instead, it falls within the implied incidental power, which was best expressed in D'Emden v Pedder (1904) 1 CLR 91 at p 110. Fullagar J, with whom Dixon CJ and Kitto J concurred, stated that the Commonwealth may control any steps leading to the export itself (generally labelled as \\"production\\") that may affect \\"beneficially or adversely\\" Australia's export trade. This includes provisions to control the quality of meat being exported, which may involve regulation of such stages as packaging and handling. In fact, it may be necessary to \\"enter the factory or the field or the mine\\" to secure Australia's export industry. In general regulation of production may occur where there is an objectively different method of production between meat destined for home and foreign consumption, but Fullager J was clear in restricting the application of the principle to the specific factual circumstances at hand. = Inconsistency = Fullagar J noted that it was possible to obey both sets of laws simultaneously, by acquiring both State and Commonwealth licenses. However, it was his opinion that the regulations expressed an intention to \\"completely and exhaustively\\" cover the field with regards to the regulation of such premises; he found the detailed regulations compelling in this regard. Furthermore, the State law would have acted to deny the rights granted by a certificate obtained under the Commonwealth regulations. The court was split 3-3. As this was a stated case and not an appeal, the decision of the Chief Justice prevailed,Judiciary Act 1903 s23 as amended by the Judiciary Act 1912. in what is sometimes described as a statutory majority. at p. 533 per Barwick CJ. Appeal In June 1955 the Privy Council gave special leave to appeal except in relation to the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and the States. The High Court subsequently refused to issue a certificate under section 74 of the Constitution. The Privy Council held that the question of whether laws were inconsistent involved the application of section 109 of the Constitution and did not involve a question in relation to the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and the States. The Privy Council approved the decision of the statutory majority, particularly the judgment of Fullager J and dismissed the appeal.; .

SPL was used to write the HP 3000's primary operating system, Multi-Programming Executive (MPE). Similar languages on other platforms were generically referred to as system programming languages, confusing matters. Originally known as Alpha Systems Programming Language, named for the development project that produced the 3000-series, SPL was designed to take advantage of the Alpha's stack-based processor design. It is patterned on ESPOL, a similar ALGOL-derived language used by the Burroughs B5000 mainframe systems, which also influenced a number of 1960s languages like PL360 and JOVIAL. Through the mid-1970s, the success of the HP systems produced a number of SPL offshoots. Examples include ZSPL for the Zilog Z80 processor, and Micro-SPL for the Xerox Alto. The later inspired Action! for the Atari 8-bit family, which was fairly successful. The latter more closely followed Pascal syntax, losing some of SPL's idiosyncrasies. SPL was widely used during the lifetime of the original integrated circuit-based versions HP 3000 platform. In the 1980s, the HP 3000 and MPE were reimplemented in an emulator running on the PA-RISC-based HP 9000 platforms. HP promoted Pascal as the favored system language on PA-RISC and did not provide an SPL compiler. This caused code maintenance concerns, and 3rd party SPL compilers were introduced to fill this need. History Hewlett-Packard introduced their first minicomputers, the HP 2100 series, in 1967. The machines had originally been designed by an external team working for Union Carbide and intended mainly for industrial embedded control uses, not the wider data processing market. HP saw this as a natural fit with their existing instrumentation business and initially pitched it to those users. In spite of this, HP found that the machine's price/performance ratio was making them increasingly successful in the business market. During this period, the concept of time sharing was becoming popular, especially as core memory costs fell and systems began to ship with more memory. In 1968, HP introduced a bundled system using two 2100-series machine running HP Time-Shared BASIC, which provided a complete operating system as well as the BASIC programming language. These two-machine systems, collectively known as HP 2000s, were an immediate success. HP BASIC was highly influential for many years, and its syntax can be seen in a number microcomputer BASICs, including Palo Alto TinyBASIC, Integer BASIC, North Star BASIC, Atari BASIC, and others. Designers at HP began to wonder \\"If we can produce a time-sharing system this good using a junky computer like the 2116, think what we could accomplish if we designed our own computer.\\" To this end, in 1968 the company began putting together a larger team to design a new mid-sized architecture. New team members included those who had worked on Burroughs and IBM mainframe systems, and the resulting concepts bore a strong resemblance to the highly successful Burroughs B5000 system. The B5000 used a stack machine processor that made multiprogramming simpler to implement, and this same architecture was also selected for the new HP concept. Two implementations were considered, a 32-bit mainframe-scale machine known as Omega, and a 16-bit design known as Alpha. Almost all effort was on the Omega, but in June 1970, Omega was canceled. This led to an extensive redesign of Alpha to differentiate it from the 2100's, and it eventually emerged with plans for an even more aggressive operating system design. Omega had intended to run in batch mode and use a smaller computer, the \\"front end\\", to process interactions with the user. This was the same operating concept as the 2000 series. However, yet-another-2000 would not be enough for Alpha, and the decision was made to have a single operating for batch, interactive and even real time operation. To make this work, it needed an advanced computer bus design with extensive direct memory access (DMA) and required an advanced operating system (OS) to provide quick responses to user actions. The B5000 was also unique, for its time, in that its operating system and core utilities were all programmed in a high-level language, ESPOL. ESPOL was a derivative of the ALGOL language tuned to work on the B5000's, a concept that was highly influential in the 1960s and led to new languages like JOVIAL, PL/360 and BCPL. The HP team decided they would also use an ALGOL-derived language for their operating systems work. HP's similar language was initially known as the Alpha Systems Programming Language. Alpha took several years to develop before emerging in 1972 as the HP 3000. The machine was on the market for only a few months before it was clear it simply wasn't working right, and HP was forced to recall all 3000's already sold. It was reintroduced in late 1973 with most of its problems having been fixed. A major upgrade to the entire system, the CX machine, and MPE-C to run on it, reformed its image and the 3000 went on to be another major success during the second half of the 1970s. This success made SPL almost as widespread as the 2000 series' BASIC, and like that language, SPL resulted in a number of versions for other platforms. Notable among them was Micro-SPL, a version written for the Xerox Alto workstation. This machine had originally used BCPL as its primary language, but dissatisfaction with its performance led Henry Baker to design a non-recursive language that he implemented with Clinton Parker in 1979. Clinton would then further modify Micro-SPL to produce Action! for the Atari 8-bit family in 1983. HP reimplemented the HP 3000 system on the PA-RISC chipset, running a new version of the operating system known as MPE/iX. MPE/iX had two modes, in \\"native mode\\" it ran applications that had been recompiled for the PA-RISC using newer Pascal compilers, while under \\"compatible mode\\" it could run all existing software via emulation. HP did not supply a native mode compiler for MPE/iX so it was not an easy process to move existing software to the new platform. To fill the need, Allegro Consultants wrote an SPL- compatible language named \\"SPLash!\\" that could compile to original HP 3000 code to run within the emulator, or to native mode. This offered a porting pathway for existing SPL software. Language =Basic syntax= SPL generally follows ALGOL 60 syntax conventions, and will be familiar to anyone with experience in ALGOL or its descendants, like Pascal and Modula-2. Like those languages, program statements can span multiple physical lines and end with a semicolon. Comments are denoted with the keyword, or by surrounding the comment text in << and >>. Statements are grouped into blocks using BEGIN and END, although, as in Pascal, the END of a program must be followed by a period. The program as a whole is surrounded by BEGIN and END., similar to Pascal, but lacking a PROGRAM keyword or similar statement at the top. The reason for this is that SPL allows any block of code to be used as a program on its own, or compiled into another program to act as a library. The creation of code as a program or subprogram was not part of the language itself, handled instead by placing the compiler directive at the top of the file. The language used the INTRINSIC keyword to allow external code to be called directly by giving it a local name. For instance, a machine language library exposing a function to run the console bell could be imported to an SPL program as and then the bell could be operated by using the keyword as if it was a native command. In contrast to Pascal, where and were separate concepts, SPL uses a more C-like approach where any can be prefixed with a type to turn it into a function. In keeping with the syntax of other ALGOL-like languages, the types of the parameters were listed after the name, not part of it. For instance: INTEGER PROCEDURE FACT(N); VALUE N; INTEGER N; Declares a function FACT that takes a value N that is an integer. The indicates that this variable is also the return value for the procedure. Although frowned upon, ALGOL and Pascal allowed code to be labeled using a leading name ending with a colon, which could then be used for the target of loops and statements. One minor difference is that SPL required the label names to be declared in the variable section using the keyword. SPL added to this concept with the statement which allowed these labels to be further defined as \\"entry points\\" that could be accessed from the command line. Labels named in the entry statement(s) were exposed to the operating system and could be called from the RUN command. For instance, one could write a program containing string functions to convert to uppercase or lowercase, and then provide ENTRY points for these two. This could be called from the command line as . =Data types= Where SPL differs most noticeably from ALGOL is that its data types are very machine specific, based on the 3000's 16-bit big endian word format. The type is a 16-bit signed type, with 15 bits of value and the least significant bit as the sign. is a 32-bit integer, not a floating-point type. is a 32-bit floating-point value with 22 bits for the mantissa and 9 for the exponent, while is a 64-bit floating-point value with 54 bits of mantissa and 9 bits exponent. is used for character processing, consisting of a 16-bit machine word holding two 8-bit characters. is a boolean type that stores a single bit in the most significant bit. There is no equivalent of a modifier as found in Pascal, so is somewhat wasteful of memory. Like C, data is weakly typed, memory locations and variable storage are intermixed concepts, and one can access values directly through their locations. For instance, the code: INTEGER A,B,C LOGICAL D=A+2 defines three 16-bit integer variables, A, B and C, and then a LOGICAL, also a 16-bit value. The , like Pascal, means \\"is equivalent to\\", not \\"gets the value of\\", which uses in Algol-like languages. So the second line states \\"declare a variable D that is in the same memory location as A+2\\", which in this case is also the location of the variable C. This allows the same value to be read as an integer via C or a logical through D. This syntax may seem odd to modern readers where memory is generally a black box, but it has a number of important uses in systems programming where particular memory locations hold values from the underlying hardware. In particular, it allows one to define a variable that points to the front of a table of values, and then declare additional variables that point to individual values within the table. If the table location changes, only a single value has to change, the initial address, and all of the individual variables will automatically follow in their proper relative offsets. Pointers were declared by adding the modifier to any variable declaration, and the memory location of a variable dereferenced with the . Thus declares a pointer who's value contains the address of the variable A, not the value of A. can be used on either side of the assignment; puts the value of A into P, likely resulting in a dangling pointer, makes P point to A, while puts the value of A into the location currently pointed to by P. In a similar fashion, SPL includes C-like array support in which the index variable is a number-of-words offset from the memory location set for the initial variable. Unlike C, SPL only provided one- dimensional arrays, and used parentheses as opposed to brackets. Variables could also be declared , in which case no local memory was set aside for them and the storage was assumed to be declared in another library. This mirrors the keyword in C. Literals can be specified with various suffixes, and those without a suffix are assumed to be . For instance, would be interpreted as an , while was a . denoted a and a . String constants were delimited by double- quotes, and double-quotes within a line were escaped with a second double- quote. Variable declarations could use constants to define an initial value, as in . Note the use of the assign-to rather than is-a. Additionally, SPL had a keyword that allowed a string of text to be defined as a variable, and then replaced any instances of that variable in the code with the literal string during compiles. This is similar to the keyword in C. =Memory segmentation= As was common in the era, the HP 3000 used a byte-oriented segmented memory model in which an address was a single 16-bit word, allowing code to access up to 65,536 bytes (or as they termed it, \\"half-words\\"). To allow larger amounts of memory to be accessed, a virtual memory system was used. When memory was accessed, the 16-bit address was prefixed with one of two 8-bit segment values, one for the program code (PB) and another for variable data. The result was a 24-bit address. Thus, while each program had access to a total of 128 kB at any one time, it could swap the segments to access a full 16 MB memory space. SPL included a variety of support systems to allow programs to be easily segmented and then make that segmentation relatively invisible in the code. The primary mechanism was to use the compiler directive which defined which segment the following code should be placed in. The default was , but the programmer could add any number of additional named segments to organize the code into blocks. =Other features= SPL included a \\"bit-extraction\\" feature that allowed simplified bit fiddling. Any bit, or string of bits, in a word could be accessed using the syntax, where x and y were the start and end bit positions from 0 to 15. Thus returned the lower byte of the word storing A. This format could be used to split and merge bits as needed. Additionally, additional operations were provided for shifts and rotates, and could be applied to any variable with the , for instance . Example This simple program, from the 1984 version of the reference manual, shows most of the features of the SPL language. The program as a whole is delimited between the and . It begins with the definition of a series of global variables, A, B and C, defines a single procedure and then calls it twenty times. Note that the procedure does not have a BEGIN and END of its own because it contains only one line of actual code, the is not considered part of the code itself, it is indicating the type of the three parameters being passed in on the line above and is considered part of that line. BEGIN INTEGER A:=0, B, C:=1; PROCEDURE N(X,Y,Z); INTEGER X,Y,Z; X:=X*(Y+Z); FOR B:=1 UNTIL 20 DO N(A,B,C); END.

Diabetes develops in NOD mice as a result of insulitis, a leukocytic infiltrate of the pancreatic islets. The onset of diabetes is associated with a moderate glycosuria and a non-fasting hyperglycemia. It is recommended to monitor for development of glycosuria from 10 weeks of age; this can be carried out using urine glucose dipsticks. NOD mice will develop spontaneous diabetes when left in a sterile environment.Eisenbarth, GS. Type 1 Diabetes: Molecular Cellular and Clinical Immunology. 2004; 552 The incidence of spontaneous diabetes in the NOD mouse is 60‚Äì80% in females and 20‚Äì30% in males. Onset of diabetes also varies between males and females: commonly, onset is delayed in males by several weeks.  History  Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice exhibit a susceptibility to spontaneous development of autoimmune insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). The NOD strain and related strains were developed at Shionogi Research Laboratories in Aburahi, Japan by Makino and colleagues and first reported in 1980. The group developed the NOD strain by an outbreeding of the cataract- prone strain from JcI:ICR mice.  Susceptibility  The susceptibility to IDDM is polygenic and environment exerts a strong effect on gene penetrances. Environment including housing conditions, health status, and diet all affect development of diabetes in the mice. For instance, NOD mice maintained in different laboratories can have different levels of incidence. The incidence of disease is linked to Microbiome. NOD mice are also susceptible to developing other autoimmune syndromes, including autoimmunine sialitis, autoimmune thyroiditis, autoimmune peripheral polyneuropathy etc. Diabetes in these mice can be prevented by a single injection of mycobacterial adjuvants such as complete Freund's adjuvant (FCA) or Bacille de Calmette et Gu√©rin or BCG vaccine.  Identifying IDDM susceptibility loci  Genetic Loci associated with susceptibility to IDDM have been identified in the NOD mouse strain through the development of congenic mouse strains, which have identified several insulin dependent diabetes (Idd) loci. The most important is idd1which is the major histocompatibility complex class II loci I-Ag7. NOD mice have polymorphisms in the Idd3 locus which are linked to IL-2 production. IL-2 promotes either immunity or tolerance in a concentration dependent fashion by acting on T helper cells, CTL and NK cells. Low amounts of IL-2 may be needed to promote survival of Treg in mice. Loss of IL-2 can thereby contribute to the development of autoimmunity in NOD mice. NOD mice have a mutation in exon 2 of the CTLA-4 gene, which causes it to be spliced incorrectly. CTLA-4 plays a major role in suppressing the T-cell immune response. Without the proper functioning of CTLA-4 T-cells attack the insulin producing cells. This results in Type 1 Diabetes.

It was originally transmitted on Friday 26 December 1975. The episode is features a dual role played by Arthur Lowe, in his regular role of Captain Mainwaring and as Mainwaring's estranged brother Barry. Synopsis Just as Captain Mainwaring gives the go-ahead for a sherry party, his drunken brother Barry turns up to spoil the occasion because he is drunk Plot As Mainwaring and the platoon return from an exhilarating route march, he discovers Wilson reading Pike's Hotspur comic. There is a letter written in Pike's handwriting hidden amongst the pages. Mainwaring reads it and is instantly disgusted. He convenes an impromptu parade, where he confronts Pike about the letter, and asks Wilson to read it. It says that the Home Guard will only spot any parachutists if they land in a public house, and that their section made sure there were no parachutists in eleven pubs in two hours! Mainwaring makes the platoon promise that he will not hear any more stories about his men drinking. He goes on to say that he has offered to be the host for a sherry party for local civil dignitaries and army officers. Jones' section (sans Frazer, because he's \\"meeting\\" a client in Eastbourne) volunteer themselves as stewards. When they leave, Mainwaring praises his men, declaring them indispensable. Wilson asks if Mainwaring was harsh about the public house business, but Mainwaring does not think he was, and blames it on the way he was brought up: every member of his family knew when to stop. Meanwhile, on board a train carriage, a drunken figure with more than a passing resemblance to Mainwaring downs a bottle of Scotch. The train stops at Eastbourne, and Frazer joins the man in the carriage, and quickly learns that the drunken man is Mainwaring's black sheep brother Barry, and that he is on his way to Walmington to collect a half-hunter watch that, he claims, Mainwaring stole from him after their father's demise. Frazer is more than happy to tell Mainwaring that his brother is in town. A few days later, Mainwaring tells Wilson that he is not ashamed of his brother, but he feels that he let his talents go to waste, while he became a respected and trustworthy figure who can look the world full in the face. Barry rings and Mainwaring declines the call, leaving it to Wilson. Mainwaring tells Wilson to tell Barry that he will meet him at the Red Lion inn. When he gets there, he confronts Barry about the watch. Barry claims that their father intended to give Barry the watch for looking after him. Mainwaring scoffs at his attempts to look after their father, and refuses to hand over the watch. Barry blackmails his brother by saying that he will show him up at the sherry party if he does not. Mainwaring reluctantly hands over the watch, getting Barry's solemn oath that he will be out of Walmington on the 9:30 train. The party goes well until Barry unexpectedly arrives, wanting to apologise for his earlier behaviour, and gets into a lengthy chat with Chief Warden Hodges, the Vicar and the Verger. Pike drags him into the dressing room, giving him a bottle of sherry to himself, in exchange for keeping his mouth shut. Mainwaring arrives, and Hodges gleefully tells him that he had a chat with his brother. Mainwaring is shocked and asks Wilson, Frazer, Jones, Sponge and Pike to get him out as soon as possible. They try shoving him through the window, but he is too fat, so they carry a comatose Barry out in an empty cupboard. Wilson admits to Mainwaring that he retrieved the watch for him, but Mainwaring's heart of gold allows him to give the watch back to Wilson, and tells Wilson to give it back to Barry and wish him well. Notes #There is only one scene where both the Mainwaring brothers appear on screen at the same time. This is set in the bedroom at the Red Lion hotel where Barry is staying. Barry spends most of the scene sitting or lying on his bed whereas Captain Mainwaring stays close to the door. The camera angles during the scene are usually set so that only one of the brothers is seen at once, the other speaking out of vision, allowing Arthur Lowe to pre-record his dialogue for the unseen brother.

Ashton Court estate, a recreational area owned by Bristol City Council lies just to the north, the Long Ashton by-pass (Brunel Way, the A370) to the south and the River Avon to the east. The area is now mainly residential but also includes the Faculty of Arts, Creative Industries and Education (formerly the School of Creative Arts) of the University of the West of England, Ashton Park School, which is a specialist Sports College and the Horse and Dog section of Avon and Somerset Constabulary as well as about 180 allotments in 5 different areas. Clifton Bridge and Ashton Gate railway stations are both now closed, but there is some pressure to reopen the latter as part of a rapid transit link from Portishead. History Bower Ashton was historically a hamlet in the parish of Long Ashton in Somerset.Vision of Britain: Gazetteer of the British Isles (1887) In medieval times the area was owned by St Augustine's Abbey, but following the Dissolution the Smyth estate was established by John Smyth, a merchant from Small Street in the city, in the 16th century. In the 19th century Sir John Henry Greville Smyth rebuilt Ashton Court Mansion along with a now demolished Dower house on the present site of the School of Creative Arts. Maps of that era show a ropewalk, Frayne's Colliery and Ashton Vale Iron works, adjacent to the Portishead railway line. An Iron Foundry was in operation in the area until the 1900s. From ancient times the Rownham Ferry linked Bower Ashton with Hotwells. It medieval times it was owned by the monks of St Augustine's Abbey and brought them considerable income. There was also a ford downstream but due to the great tidal range this was dangerous. The ferry remained in operation until it closed in the 1930s, after the opening of the Ashton Swing Bridge at Ashton Gate. Legend has it that King Charles I crossed the Avon from Hotwells via the ferry on his way to Leigh Court in 1651. In 1914, it was the location of the Bristol International Exhibition. In 1951, the area was transferred from Long Ashton parish to Bristol.Vision of Britain: Long Ashton CP/AP Attractions Bower Ashton is also the location of the playing grounds of Bedminster Cricket Club (founded in 1847, for whom W.G. Grace played) and has a small part of the River Avon Trail (the old Tow Path) running along the River Avon in Greville Smyth Park, which was developed from land given to the city by Sir Greville Smyth. The park walk gives a classic view of the full span of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge across the Avon Gorge between Leigh Woods in North Somerset and Clifton in Bristol. Across the River Avon are the lock gate entrances to Bristol Docks and the 'Floating Harbour' (completed in 1809) in Hotwells and the large Samuel Plimsoll Swing Bridge.

With the advent of broadband Internet access and portable digital audio playback devices such as the iPod, podcasting began to catch hold in late 2004. Today there are more than 115,000 English-language podcasts available on the Internet, and dozens of websites available for distribution at little or no cost to the producer or listener. According to one survey in 2017, 42 million Americans above the age of 12 listen to podcasts at least on a weekly basis.  Precursors  Before the advent of the World Wide Web, in the 1980s, RCS (Radio Computing Services), provided music and talk-related software to radio stations in a digital format. Before online music digital distribution, the MIDI format as well as the Mbone, Multicast Network was used to distribute audio and video files. The MBone was a multicast network over the Internet used primarily by educational and research institutes, but there were audio talk programs.Miles, Peggy and Dean Sakai, Internet Age Broadcaster I and II, National Association of Broadcasters. Many other jukeboxes and websites in the mid-1990s provided a system for sorting and selecting music or audio files, talk, segue announcements of different digital formats. There were a few websites that provided audio subscription services. In 1993, the early days of Internet radio, Carl Malamud launched Internet Talk Radio which was the \\"first computer-radio talk show, each week interviewing a computer expert\\". It was distributed \\"as audio files that computer users fetch one by one\\". A 1993 episode of The Computer Chronicles described the concept as \\"asynchronous radio\\". Malamud said listeners could pause and restart the audio files at will, as well as skip content they did not like. Some websites allowed downloadable audio shows, such as the comedy show The Dan & Scott Show, available on AOL.com from 1996. Additionally, in 1998, Radio Usach, radio station from the University of Santiago, Chile, explored the option to broadcast online and on demand streaming talk shows.University of Santiago of Chile - Jose Zorrilla - Outstanding professionals interview However, the development of downloaded music did not reach a critical mass until the launch of Napster, another system of aggregating music, but without the subscription services provided by podcasting or video blogging aggregation client or system software. Independent of the development of podcasting via RSS, a portable player and music download system had been developed at Compaq Research as early as 1999 or 2000. Called PocketDJ, it would have been launched as a service for the Personal Jukebox or a successor, the first hard-disk based MP3-player. In 2001, Applian Technologies of San Francisco, California introduced Replay Radio (later renamed into Replay AV), a TiVo-like recorder for Internet Radio Shows. Besides scheduling and recording audio, one of the features was a Direct Download link, which would scan a radio publishers site for new files and copy them directly to a PC's hard disk. The first radio show to publish in this format was WebTalkGuys World Radio Show, produced by Rob and Dana Greenlee.  Timeline  In September 2000, the first system that enabled the selection, automatic downloading and storage of serial episodic audio content on PCs and portable devices was launched from early MP3 player manufacturer, i2Go. To supply content for its portable MP3 players, i2Go introduced a digital audio news and entertainment service called MyAudio2Go.com that enabled users to download episodic news, sports, entertainment, weather, and music in audio format for listening on a PC, the eGo portable audio player, or other MP3 players. The i2GoMediaManager and the eGo file transfer application could be programmed to automatically download the latest episodic content available from user selected content types to a PC or portable device as desired. The service lasted over a year, but succumbed when the i2Go company ran out of capital during the dot-com crash and folded. =The RSS connection= In October 2000, the concept of attaching sound and video files in RSS feeds was proposed in a draft by Tristan Louis.Louis, Tristan, 2000-10-13 Suggestion for RSS 0.92 specification The idea was implemented by Dave Winer, a software developer and an author of the RSS format.Pot, Justin, 2013-08-23 The Evolution Of The Podcast ‚Äî How A Medium Was Born Winer had received other customer requests for \\"audioblogging\\" features and had discussed the enclosure concept (also in October 2000) with Adam Curry,Curry, Adam, 2000-10-27 The Bandwidth Issue ; server discontinued by Userland, late 2005. a user of Userland's Manila and Radio blogging and RSS aggregator software.

Calling it 0.92... called \\"enclosure\\",Winer, Dave, 2000-10-31 Virtual Bandwidth; and 2001-01-11 Payloads for RSS . which would simply pass the address to a media aggregator. On January 11, 2001, Winer demonstrated the RSS enclosure feature by enclosing a Grateful Dead song in his Scripting News weblog.Winer, Dave, 2001-01-11 Scripting News: Tonight's song on the Grateful Dead audio weblog is Truckin... For its first two years, the enclosure element had relatively few users and many developers simply avoided using it. Winer's company incorporated both RSS-enclosure and feed-aggregator features in its weblogging product, Radio Userland, the program favored by Curry, audioblogger Harold Gilchrist and others. Since Radio Userland had a built-in aggregator, it provided both the \\"send\\" and \\"receive\\" components of what was then called \\"audioblogging\\".Curry, Adam, 2002-10-21 UserNum 1014: Cool to hear my own audio-blog... Gilchrist, Harold 2002-10-27 Audioblog/Mobileblogging News this morning I'm experimenting with producing an audioblogging show... All that was needed for \\"podcasting\\" was a way to automatically move audio files from Radio Userland's download folder to an audio player (either software or hardware)‚Äîalong with enough compelling audio to make such automation worth the trouble. In June 2003, Stephen Downes demonstrated aggregation and syndication of audio files in his Ed Radio application.Downes, Stephen, June 2003 Ed Radio Ed Radio scanned RSS feeds for MP3 files, collected them into a single feed, and made the result available as SMIL or Webjay audio feeds. =The first feed= In August 2000, the New England Patriots of the NFL launched the IP radio show, PFW in Progress. It was a live show that was recorded and offered on demand on Patriots.com. With the introduction of the iPod and iTunes platform in 2005, the show was also offered there. Today, it is still in existence, under the name Patriots Unfiltered, and available on all podcast platforms. In September 2003, Winer created a special RSS-with-enclosures feed for his Harvard Berkman Center colleague Christopher Lydon's weblog, which previously had a text-only RSS feed. Lydon, a former New York Times reporter, Boston TV news anchor and NPR talkshow host, had developed a portable recording studio, conducted in-depth interviews with bloggers, futurists and political figures, and posted MP3 files as part of his Harvard blog. When Lydon had accumulated about 25 audio interviews, Winer gradually released them as a new RSS feed.Lydon, Chris 2003 Chris Lydon Interviews... Announcing the feed in his weblog, Winer challenged other aggregator developers to support this new form of content and provide enclosure support. Not long after, Pete Prodoehl released a skin for the Amphetadesk aggregator that displayed enclosure links.Prodoehl, Peter, 2003-09-24 RasterWeb: Enclose This! Doug Kaye, who had been publishing MP3 recordings of his interviews at IT Conversations since June, created an RSS feed with enclosures.Kaye, Doug, 2003-09-24 Blogarithms Lydon's blog eventually became Radio Open Source and is now the oldest, still-running podcast. =BloggerCon= October 2003, Winer and friends organized the first BloggerCon weblogger conference at Berkman Center.

In November 2003, the company AudioFeast (later renamed PodBridge, then VoloMedia) filed a patent application for ‚ÄúMethod for Providing Episodic Media‚Äù with the USPTO based on its work in developing the AudioFeast service launched in September 2004. Although AudioFeast did not refer to itself as a podcasting service and was not built on RSS, it provided a way of downloading episodic audio content through desktop software and portable devices, with a system similar to the MyAudio2Go.com service four years before it. (AudioFeast shut down its service in July 2005 due to the unwillingness of its free customers to pay for its $49.95 paid annual subscription service, and a lack of a strong competitive differentiation in the market with the emergence of free RSS podcatchers.) In May 2004, Eric Rice, then of SlackStreet.com, along with Randy Dryburgh of VocalSpace.com launched Audioblog.com as the first commercial podcasting hosting service. Audioblog.com became Hipcast.com in June 2006 and has hosted hundreds of thousands of podcasts since. In September 2004, the media-in- newsfeed idea was picked up by multiple developer groups. While many of the early efforts remained command-line based, the very first podcasting client with a graphic user interface was iPodderX (later called Transistr after a trademark dispute with Apple), developed by August Trometer and Ray Slakinski. It was released first for the Mac, then for the PC. Shortly thereafter, another group (iSpider) rebranded their software as iPodder and released it under that name as Free Software (under GPL). The project was terminated after a cease and desist letter from Apple (over iPodder trademark issues). It was reincarnated as Juice and CastPodder. =The name= Writing for The Guardian in February 2004, journalist Ben Hammersley suggested the term \\"podcasting\\" as a name for the nascent technology. Seven months later, Dannie Gregoire used the term \\"podcasting\\" to describe the automatic downloadGregoire, Dannie J. 2004. \\"How to handle getting past episodes?\\" In the ipodder-dev mailing list, Thu, 2004-09-16. and synchronization of audio content; he also registered several \\"podcast\\" related domains (e.g. podcast.net). The use of \\"podcast\\" by Gregoire was picked up by podcasting evangelists such as Dave Slusher,David Slusher's Podcasts. WinerWiner, Dave, 2004-09-24 Scripting News: I've been lurking on the ipodder-dev list... and Curry, and entered common usage. Also in September, Adam Curry launched a mailing list, then Slashdot had a 100+ message discussion, bringing even more attention to the podcasting developer projects in progress. On September 28, 2004, Blogger and technology columnist Doc Searls began keeping track of how many \\"hits\\" Google found for the word \\"podcasts\\". His first query reportedly returned 24 results.Searls, Doc. 2004-09-28. Doc Searls' IT Garage, \\"DIY Radio with PODcasting. \\" On September 28, 2004, there were 526 hits on Google's search engine for the word \\"podcasts\\". Google Trends marks the beginning of searches for \\"podcast\\" at the end of September. On October 1, 2004, there were 2,750 hits on Google's search engine for the word \\"podcasts\\". This number continued to double every few days. By October 11, 2004, capturing the early distribution and variety of podcasts was more difficult than counting Google hits. However, by the end of October, The New York Times had reported on podcasts across the United States and in Canada, Australia and Sweden, mentioning podcast topics from technology to veganism to movie reviews. =Wider notice= USA Today told its readers about the \\"free amateur chatfests\\" the following February, profiling several podcasters, giving instructions for sending and receiving podcasts, and including a \\"Top Ten\\" list from one of the many podcast directories that had sprung up. Those Top Ten programs gave further indication of podcast topics: four were about technology (including Curry's Daily Source Code, which also included music and personal chat), three were about music, one about movies, one about politics, and‚Äîat the time number one on the list‚ÄîThe Dawn and Drew Show, described as \\"married-couple banter\\", a program format that (as USA Today noted) was popular on American broadcast radio in the 1940s (e.g. Breakfast with Dorothy and Dick). After Dawn and Drew, such \\"couplecasts\\" became quite popular among independent podcasts, the most notable being the London couple Sowerby and Luff (consisting of comedy writers Brian West (Luff) and Georgina Sowerby), whose talk show The Big Squeeze quickly achieved a global audience via the podcast Comedy 365. On October 18, 2004, the number of hits on Google's search engine for the word \\"podcasts\\" surpassed 100,000. See September 28, 2005. In October 2004, detailed how-to podcast articles had begun to appear online, and a month later, Liberated Syndication (Libsyn) launched the first Podcast Service Provider, offering storage, bandwidth, and RSS creation tools. This was the same month that Podtrac started providing its free download tracking service and audience demographics survey to the podcasting industry. \\"Podcasting\\" was first defined in Wikipedia. In November 2004, podcasting networks started to appear on the scene with podcasters affiliating with one another. One of the earliest adopters from the mainstream media was the BBC, with the BBC World Service show, Go Digital, podcast in August 2001. The first domestic BBC show to be podcast was In Our Time, made available as a podcast in November 2004. =Apple adds podcasts to iTunes= In June 2005, Apple added podcasting to its iTunes 4.9 music software and building a directory of podcasts at its iTunes Music Store.Apple Takes Podcasting Mainstream Apple Press InfoiTunes 4.9 with podcasting available for download‚Äîstill no formal announcement Engadget The new iTunes could subscribe to, download and organize podcasts, which made a separate aggregator application unnecessary for many users. Apple also promoted creation of podcasts using its GarageBand and QuickTime Pro software and the MPEG 4 Audio (M4A) format instead of MP3. In July 2005, U.S. President George W. Bush became a podcaster of sorts, when the White House website added an RSS 2.0 feed to the previously downloadable files of the president's weekly radio addresses.White House, 2005. White House Radio Addresses. Also in July, the first People's Choice Podcast Awards were held during Podcast Expo. Awards were given in 20 categories. On September 28, 2005, exactly a year after first tracking hits for the word \\"podcasts\\" on Google's search engine, Google found more than 100 million hits on the word \\"podcasts\\". In November 2005, the first Portable Media Expo and Podcasting Conference was held at the Ontario Convention Center in Ontario, California. The annual conference changed its name to the Podcast and New Media Expo which stopped being held in 2015. On December 3, 2005, \\"podcast\\" was named the word of the year in 2005 by the New Oxford American Dictionary and would be in the dictionary in 2006. =Expansion= In February 2006, following London radio station LBC's successful launch of the first premium-podcasting platform LBC Plus, there was widespread acceptance that podcasting had considerable commercial potential. UK comedian Ricky Gervais launched a new series of his popular podcast The Ricky Gervais Show. The second series of the podcast was distributed through audible.co.uk and was the first major podcast to charge consumers to download the show at 95 pence per half-hour episode. The first series of The Ricky Gervais Show podcast had been freely distributed by the Positive Internet Company and marketed through The Guardian newspaper's website, and had become the world's most successful podcast to date with over 4.5 million downloads two months after the show was released according to The Guinness Book of World Records. Even in its new subscription format, The Ricky Gervais Show was regularly the most-downloaded podcast on iTunes. In February 2006, LA podcaster Lance Anderson became nearly the first to take a podcast and create a live venue tour. The Lance Anderson Podcast Experment (sic) included a sold- out extravaganza in The Pilgrim, a central Liverpool (UK) venue (February 23, 2006), followed by a theatrical event at The Rose Theatre, Edge Hill University (February 24, 2006) which included appearances by Mark Hunter from The Tartan Podcast, Jon and Rob from Top of the Pods, Dan Klass from The Bitterest Pill via video link from Los Angeles and live music from The Hotrod Cadets. In addition, Anderson was also invited to take part in the first ever Podcast Forum at CARET, the Centre for Applied Research in Educational Technologies at the University of Cambridge (February 21, 2006). Organised and supported by Josh Newman, the university's Apple Camp Rep, Anderson was joined at this event by Dr. Chris Smith from the Naked Scientists Podcast; Debbie McGowan, an Open University lecturer and advocate for podcasting in education; and Nigel Paice, a professional music producer and podcasting tutor. In March 2006, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper became the first head of government to issue a podcast, the \\"Prime Minister of Canada's Podcast\\". In July 2009, the company VoloMedia is awarded the \\"Podcast patent\\" by the USPTO in patent number 7,568,213. Dave Winer, the co-inventor of podcasting (with Adam Curry), points out that his invention predated this patent by two years. On February 2, 2006 Virginia Tech (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University) launched the first regular schedule of podcast programming at the university. Four regularly scheduled podcast were a first for a major American university as part of Virginia Tech's \\"Invent the Future\\" campaign.https://www.vtmag.vt.edu/spring06/feature1.html In April 2006, comedy podcast Never Not Funny began when Matt Belknap of A Special Thing records interviewed Comedian Jimmy Pardo on the podcast for his popular alternative comedy forum A Special Thing. The two had previously discussed producing a podcast version of Jimmy's Los Angeles show \\"Running Your Trap\\", which he hosted at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, but they hit it off so well on AST Radio that Pardo said \\"This is the show.\\" Shortly after, Never Not Funny started simulcasting both a podcast stream and a paid video version. The Podcast still uses this format releasing two shows a week one free and one paid along with paid video feed. In October 2006, the This American Life radio program began to offer a podcast version to listeners. Since debuting,This American Life has consistently been one of the most-listened to podcasts, averaging around 2.5 million downloads per episode. In March 2007, after being on air talent and being fired from KYSR (STAR) in Los Angeles, California, Jack and Stench started their own subscription-based podcast. At $5.00 per subscription, subscribers had access to a one-hour podcast, free of any commercials. They had free local events at bars, ice cream parlors and restaurants all around Southern California. With a successful run of 12 years and over 2,700 podcasts, Jack and Stench Show is among the longest running monetized podcasts. In March 2007, the Cambridge CARET Centre also helped to give birth to the first as live podcast channel for women politicians in the UK and globally www.wpradio.co.uk (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_Parliamentary_Radio) now www.parliamentaryradio.com. Former BBC correspondent and political editor in the East Boni Sones OBE worked with three other broadcast journalists Jackie Ashley, Deborah McGurran and Linda Fairbrother to create an online radio station where women MPs of all parties could be interviewed impartially. The MP3 files could be streamed or downloaded. Their resulting 550 interviews over 15 years can now be found in one of four audio Archives nationally at the British Library, the London School of Economics, The History of Parliament Trust and now the Churchill Archives University of Cambridge (https://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/archives/collections/guide-holdings/#S). Sones has also written four books about these podcast interviews and archives which are in all the major Libraries of the UK. The Adam Carolla Show started as a regular weekday podcast in March 2009 and by March 2011, 59.6 million podcasts had been downloaded, breaking Ricky Gervais' previous world record. The BBC noted in 2011 that more people (eight million in the UK or about 16% of the population, with half listening at least once a week‚Äîa similar proportion to the USA) had downloaded podcasts than used Twitter. With a run of eight years (as of October 2013), the various podcasts provided by Wrestling Observer/Figure Four Online, including Figure Four Daily and the Bryan and Vinny Show with host Bryan Alvarez, and Wrestling Observer Radio with hosts Alvarez and Dave Meltzer, have produced over 6,000 monetized podcasts at a subscription rate of $10.99 per month. Their subscription podcast model launched in June 2005.http://www.f4wonline.com/more/membership-benefits Alvarez and Meltzer were co-hosts in the late 1990s at Eyada.com, the first Internet-exclusive live streaming radio station, broadcasting out of New York City.http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Bringing+Sports+Talk+to+the+Internet%3B+eYada.com+Launches+Second...-a057481131 In 2014, This American Life launched the first season of their Serial podcast. The podcast was a surprise success, achieving 68 million downloads by the end of Season 1 and becoming the first podcast to win a Peabody Award. The program was referred to as a \\"phenomenon\\" by media outlets and popularized true crime podcasts. True crime programs such as My Favorite Murder, Crimetown, and Casefile were produced after the release of Serial and became successful in their own right. From 2012 to 2013, surveys showed that the number of podcast listeners had dropped for the first time since 2008. However, after Serial debuted, audience numbers rose by 3%. Podcasting reached a new stage in 2017 when The New York Times debuted The Daily news podcast. The Daily is designed to match the fast pace of modern news and features original reporting and recordings of the newspaper's top stories. As of May 2019, it has the highest unique monthly US audience of any podcast. As of December 2018, Serial is the most downloaded podcast of all time, with 420 million total downloads. According to Podtrac, NPR is the most popular podcast publisher with over 175 million downloads and streams every month. Nielsen and Edison Research reported in April 2019 that they had logged 700,000 active podcasts worldwide. Their research also revealed that South Korea leads the world in podcast listeners, with 58% of South Koreans listening to podcasts every month. For comparison, in 2019 32% of Americans had listened to podcasts in the last month.  Video podcasting  Podcasts are audio recordings of people (usually a dialogue of more than one person) and are predominantly purely audio recordings, but now there has been an influx of people filming themselves recording the podcasts and sharing them on platforms such as YouTube. In the beginning of \\"audio blogging\\"/radio and video, there were very clear lines separating the audio and visual world, but now with the emergence and popularity of websites like YouTube, it seems as though those lines are beginning to blur.  Popularization  =Business model studies= Classes of MBA students have been commissioned to research podcasting and compare possible business models, and venture capital flowing to influential content providers. =Podnography= As is often the case with new technologies, pornography has become a part of the scene, producing what is sometimes called podnography.King, Daniel, Hot, steamy and now downloadable, in San Francisco Chronicle, Aug 11, 2005 =Podsafe music= The growing popularity of podcasting introduced a demand for music available for use on the shows without significant cost or licensing difficulty. Out of this demand, a growing number of tracks, by independent as well as signed acts, are now being designated \\"podsafe\\". (See also Podcasting and Music Royalties.) =Use by conventional media= Podcasting has been given a major push by conventional media. (See Podcasting by traditional broadcasters.) ;Broadcast media Podcasting has presented both opportunities and challenges for mainstream radio outlets, which on one hand see it as an alternative medium for their programs while on the other hand struggle to identify its unique affordances and subtle differences. In a famous example of the way online statistics can be misused by those unused to the nuances of the online world, marketing executives from the ABC in Australia were unsure of how to make sense of why Digital Living, at that stage a little-known podcast from one of their local stations, outrated all of their expensively produced shows. It turned out that a single segment on Blu-ray had been downloaded a massive 150,000 times in one day from a single location in China. ;Print media For example, podcasting has been picked up by some print media outlets, which supply their readers with spoken versions of their content. One of the first examples of a print publication to produce an audio podcast to supplement its printed content was the international scientific journal Nature. The Nature Podcast was set up in October 2005 by Cambridge University's award-winning \\"Naked Scientist\\", Chris Smith, who produces and presents the weekly show. Although firm business models have yet to be established, podcasting represents a chance to bring additional revenue to a newspaper through advertising, subscription fees and licensing. =Podcamps= Chris Brogan and Christopher S. Penn launched the PodCamp unconference series aimed at bringing together people interested in blogging, social media, social networking, podcasting, and video on the net, and in so doing, Brogan won the Mass High Tech All Stars award for 2008. =Podcast Movement= Veteran podcaster Gary Leland joined forces with Dan Franks and Jared Easley to form a new international conference for podcasters in early 2014 called Podcast Movement. Unlike other new media events, Podcast Movement was the first conference of its size in over a decade that was focused specifically on podcasting, and has tracks for both new and experienced podcast creators, as well as industry professionals. The sixth annual conference is expected to be attended by over 3,000 podcasters, and is scheduled for August 2019 in Orlando, FL. =Adaptions= Some popular podcasts, such as Lore, Homecoming, My Brother, My Brother, and Me and Serial, have been adapted as films or television series.  Coping with growth  While podcasting's innovators took advantage of the sound-file synchronization feature of Apple Inc.'s iPod and iTunes software‚Äîand included \\"pod\\" in the name‚Äîthe technology was always compatible with other players and programs. Apple was not actively involved until mid-2005, when it joined the market on three fronts: as a source of \\"podcatcher\\" software, as publisher of a podcast directory, and as provider of tutorials on how to create podcasts with Apple products GarageBand and QuickTime Pro. Apple CEO Steve Jobs demonstrated creating a podcast during his January 10, 2006 keynote address to the Macworld Conference & Expo using new \\"podcast studio\\" features in GarageBand 3. When it added a podcast-subscription feature to its June 28, 2005, release of iTunes 4.9, Apple also launched a directory of podcasts at the iTunes Music Store, starting with 3,000 entries. Apple's software enabled AAC encoded podcasts to use chapters, bookmarks, external links, and synchronized images displayed on iPod screens or in the iTunes artwork viewer. Two days after release of the program, Apple reported one million podcast subscriptions. Some podcasters found that exposure to iTunes' huge number of downloaders threatened to make great demands on their bandwidth and related expenses. Possible solutions were proposed, including the addition of a content delivery system, such as Liberated Syndication; Podcast Servers; Akamai; a peer-to-peer solution, BitTorrent; or use of free hosting services, such as those offered by the Internet Archive or Buzzsprout.

The word is a compound of the Japanese words ami, meaning \\"crocheted or knitted\\", and kurumi, literally \\"wrapping\\", as in nuigurumi \\"(sewn) stuffed doll\\". Amigurumi vary in size and there are no restrictions about size or look.Ramirez 2016, p. 5, \\"Even though amigurumi seem popular online due to their presence in sites such as Etsy, Pinterest and Ravelry, amigurumi is still a developing craft permeated and directly depending of emerging trends and popular culture.\\" While the art of amigurumi has been known in Japan for several decades, the craft first started appealing to the masses in other countries, especially in the West, in 2003. By 2006, amigurumi were reported to be some of the most popular items on Etsy, an online craft marketplace, where they typically sold for $10 to $100.  Origins  A large amigurumi bear According to the Crochet Guild of America (CGOA), there are earlier records of crocheted or knitted dolls made in China; early examples include three-dimensional dolls worked in crochet. According to Yoshihiro Matushita, there are records (dating from 1185) of analogous techniques in Japan, such as needle binding, a fabric creation technique predating knitting and crocheting. During the Edo period (1603‚Äì1867), Japan traded with the Dutch and, as a result, it is believed that knitting was introduced as a technique. Knitting evolved with the samurai, who were experts in creating garments and decorations for their katana and winter wear. During the Meiji era (1868‚Äì1912), Japan transitioned from being a feudal society into a more modern model. It was also during that period that industrialization started in the country. The educational model was changed and thousands of students were sent abroad to learn practices from the west. More than 3,000 westerners were hired to teach modern science, mathematics, technology, and foreign languages in Japan.Ramirez 2016, pp. 9‚Äì12 According to Dai Watanabe, \\"Women were invited to teach western needleworks during that time.\\" She also identifies the first stuffed crocheted motif, Seiyo-keito-amimono-kyouju (), a twigged loquat with a leaf and more fruit motifs, which started appearing in 1920. Aesthetic Cute amigurumi are the most aesthetically popular (see kawaii and chibi for more relevant cultural details). Amigurumi may be used as children's toys but are generally purchased or made solely for aesthetic purposes. Although amigurumi originated in Japan, the craft has become popular around the world. Technique Amigurumi can be knitted, though they are usually crocheted out of yarn or thread, using the basic techniques of crochet (such as single crochet stitch (sc), double crochet (dc), invisible decrease (inv.dec)). Amigurumi can be worked as one piece or, more usually, in sections which are sewed or crocheted together. In crochet, amigurumi are typically worked in spiral rounds to prevent \\"striping\\", a typical feature of joining crochet rounds in a project. Small gauge crochet hooks or knitting needles are typically used to achieve a tight gauge that does not allow the stuffing to show through the fabric. Stuffing can be standard polyester, wool, or cotton craft stuffing, but may be improvised from other materials. Wires, such as pipe cleaners or floral wire, may be used to make the doll posable. Plastic pellets, glass pebbles, and even stones may be inserted beneath the stuffing to distribute weight at the bottom of the figure.

Early life John McIntosh was born in Mohawk Valley near Harpersfield in the Province of New York in 1777, the son of a Scottish immigrant who was a loyalist during the American Revolution. McIntosh emigrated to Upper Canada sometime between 1795 and 1801 and settled in Matilda Township, now part of South Dundas Township. Discovery of the McIntosh apple While clearing his property, McIntosh discovered a number of seedling apple trees growing wild. He transplanted them to his garden, and by the following year only one had survived. Several years later, the tree was producing the crisp, delicious fruit that is now well known. The discoverer eventually dubbed it the 'McIntosh Red', which is still the apple's official name. McIntosh farmed the original property until his death, sometime between September 19, 1845 and January 10, 1846, near St. Lawrence Valley, Ontario.  Original tree  The original tree that spawned this legacy was damaged by fire in 1894. The McIntosh family nursed the old tree along until 1908; the last year it produced a crop; and, in 1910, it fell over. A flat headstone now marks the spot where the stump had remained for years. At least three plaques commemorating the site's historic value are also located in the vicinity. In 1962, the Ontario Heritage Foundation erected a plaque outside the former McIntosh homestead. In 2001 the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada unveiled another plaque in a nearby park and declared the apple's discovery and development an \\"event of national historic importance.\\" The park, which belongs to the Township of South Dundas, also features a large hand-painted mural depicting the apple's history.

He authored a number of fictional and non-fictional works. Early years and education He was born Salo Oskar Koplowitz to Johanna (1885‚Äì1943?) and Heinrich Koplowitz (1872‚Äì1938), a lumber dealer in K√∂nigsh√ºtte in the Upper Silesia Basin of Germany (now Chorz√≥w in southwestern Poland) who served for many years as a city council alderman and was an active Zionist.Hans-Ludwig Abmeier, \\"Seidlin, Oskar\\", Kulturportal West-Ost. After completing secondary schooling at the humanities-focused Realgymnasium in Beuthen (now Bytom) in 1929, he enrolled for one semester at the University of Freiburg and then transferred to the recently founded University of Frankfurt, which enjoyed a reputation as Germany's most progressive university and also had the highest percentage of Jewish students and professors. Here he was joined by his sister Ruth, five years his senior, and attended courses on German literature (taught by Wolfgang Pfeiffer-Belli, Julius Schwietering, Franz Schultz, Max Herrmann), French literature, philosophy (Paul Tillich), and history. He also audited courses in sociology (Theodor Adorno, Norbert Elias, Karl Mannheim). In a seminar on baroque literature taught by Martin Sommerfeld,See Oskar Seidlin, \\"Martin Sommerfeld, geb. 1894, gest. d. 26. Juli 1939\\", Monatshefte, vol. 31, no. 7 (November 1939), pp. 355‚Äì356. he made the acquaintance of the gay Jewish student Richard Plaut, beginning a friendship they maintained when they later emigrated to Switzerland and the U.S. In the fall of 1930, he transferred with Plaut for one semester to the University of Berlin, where they became acquainted with the Kattowitz editor Franz Goldstein and through him with Klaus Mann, both of whom were infatuated with Koplowitz. Upon returning to Frankfurt in 1931, he met the history student Dieter Cunz, who became his lifetime partner. He also met the literature student , who became a lifelong friend, despite Emrich's later accommodation with the Nazi regime and authorship of a doctrinaire anti-Semitic essay in 1943. In the closing years of the Weimar Republic, Koplowitz, Cunz, Plaut, and Emrich sympathized with Frankfurt's leftist student political group that was increasingly on the defensive when the growing Nazi Students League felt emboldened to disrupt courses taught by Jewish professors, including Sommerfeld. Koplowitz's primary interest was theater directing, and in 1932 he mounted a production of John Gay's The Beggar's Opera with student friends. Studies in Switzerland In February 1933, following Hitler's rise to power, Plaut left Germany for Switzerland, where he was joined in April by Koplowitz. They initially regarded the move as a temporary transfer, not a permanent emigration, and expected to return to Frankfurt once the Nazis had been turned out of office. While Plaut and Koplowitz enrolled at the University of Basel in 1933, Cunz, a gentile, remained in Frankfurt but after completing his Ph.D. in 1934 also relocated to Switzerland. Hard pressed financially and constrained in employment by their Swiss student visas, Koplowitz and Plaut relied on writing under pseudonyms as their primary source of income. Together with Cunz, they coauthored three detective novels under the collective pen name Stefan Brockhoff that were published in Nazi Germany.A German-language plot summary of these novels, excerpted from Paul Ott, Mord im Alpengl√ºhen. Der Schweizer Kriminalroman ‚Äì Geschichte und Gegenwart (Wuppertal: Nordpark, 2005), appears online. An additional novel, entitled Verwirrung um Veronika, is said to have been serialized in the Z√ºrcher Illustrierte in 1938. Cf. Angelika Jockers and Reinhard Jahn, eds., Lexikon der deutschsprachigen Krimi-Autoren (2nd ed., rev.; Munich: Verlag der Criminale, 2005).] Contemporaries of Friedrich Glauser, Koplowitz et al. are recognized as pioneers of the Swiss crime story genre (distinguished by setting and the occasional use of dialect).Stefan Brockhoff's \\"Zehn Gebote f√ºr den Kriminalroman\\" appears together with Glauser's work in Wachtmeister Studers erste F√§lle, ed. Frank G√∂hre (Zurich: Arche, 1969), pp. 177‚Äì180. The text first appeared in the Z√ºrcher Illustrierte, 5 February 1937, and is available online. In 1936 Koplowitz completed a Ph.D. with a summa cum laude dissertation on the Naturalistic theater work of the leftist German Jewish director Otto Brahm, written under the supervision first of Franz Zinkernagel, who died in 1935, and then Eduard Hoffmann-Krayer. He then relocated with Cunz to Lausanne, where he pursued postgraduate studies in French language and literature. One year later Plaut also finished his doctorate. Since their student visas were no longer extended following the completion of the Ph.D., Plaut and Koplowitz were under increasing pressure to leave Switzerland. In 1937, Koplowitz used the pen name Oskar Seidlin (possibly devised because of its similarity both to his mother's maiden name, Seidler, and to H√∂lderlin) for his young readers' tale Pedronis muss geholfen werden!A plot summary is provided by WorldCat: \\"When the Pedroni Theatrical Troupe is not allowed to perform because the previous troupe is suspected in the disappearance of the Golden Apple that is the symbol of a Swiss town, two of the troupe's children along with the mayor's son and a young girl find a clue and help reveal the Apple's whereabouts through a play of their own.\\" A collection of his poems entitled Mein Bilderbuch was published under the same nom de plume in 1938.Mein Bilderbuch bears the dedication \\"F√ºr Dieter\\", i.e., for Dieter Cunz. Together with Plaut, Koplowitz and Cunz decided to emigrate to the U.S. Emigration to the U.S. In 1938, the three left Switzerland for New York, where within a year their paths diverged. Koplowitz worked briefly as a dishwasher before finding employment as an amanuensis for the emigres Thomas Mann and Erika Mann. In 1939, he obtained a lecturership in German language and literature at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, where he advanced to an assistant professorship in 1941.While at Smith College, Seidlin was acquainted with Newton Arvin. See John Leonard, \\"Music for Chameleons\\", The Nation (New York), July 23, 2001. Cunz was awarded a grant to conduct historical research in Maryland, and in 1939 he received a teaching appointment at the University of Maryland, where he rose through the ranks and long chaired the Department of German. Plaut remained in New York City, where he officially changed his name to Plant and worked for the emigre Klaus Mann. Koplowitz would officially change his name to Seidlin in 1943, when he was naturalized as a U.S. citizen. With Plant, he coauthored S.O.S. Geneva, a young readers' book with a cosmopolitan and pacifistic theme that was published in English in October 1939, just before the outbreak of World War II. Under the title Der goldene Apfel, an abridged and annotated version of Seidlin's Pedronis muss geholfen werden! was published in 1942 for use in German language instruction. Between 1942 and 1946, he was granted an extended wartime leave from his teaching position at Smith to serve with the \\"Ritchie Boys\\" (Military Intelligence Service). A second lieutenant, he served under Hans Habe in Germany, and with Billy Wilder he was involved in making a documentary film about Nazi concentration camps.The British Film Institute provides information on Die Todesm√ºhlen (1945) online. Additional German-language information is also available online. While his father died in 1938 and his sister Ruth was imprisoned at hard labor from 1935 to 1940 for political activities before emigrating first to the Shanghai Ghetto and then to Australia, his mother was killed in Auschwitz, probably in 1943. In 1946, Seidlin recorded his religion as Lutheran on a personnel information form. Ohio State University Following World War II, Seidlin made the acquaintance of Bernhard Blume while teaching at the German Summer School of Middlebury College in Vermont.See Oskar Seidlin, \\"In Memoriam: Bernhard Blume (1901-1978)\\", German Quarterly, vol. 51, no. 4 (1978), pp. 441-442. Also an emigre who had left Nazi Germany in 1936, Blume chaired the Department of German at Ohio State University beginning in 1945, and he offered Seidlin an assistant professorship there. Seidlin moved to Columbus in the autumn of 1946, and he solidified his credentials with an essay on Goethe's Faust that appeared in the Publications of the Modern Language Association (1947).Oskar Seidlin, \\"Helena: vom Mythos zur Person. Versuch einer Neu‚ÄëInterpretation des Helena‚ÄëAktes, Faust II\\", PMLA, vol. 62, no. 1 (1947), pp. 183-212. He collaborated on An Outline‚ÄëHistory of German Literature (1948) with the prominent Swiss-American comparatist Werner Paul Friederich (1905‚Äì1993), professor at the University of North Carolina, and Philip Allison Shelley (1907‚Äì1974), head of the German Department at Pennsylvania State University. In rapid order, Seidlin was promoted to an associate professorship in 1948 and to a full professorship in 1950. He revisited the subject of his doctoral dissertation by editing the correspondence of Otto Brahm with Arthur Schnitzler (1953). To escape the summer heat in Columbus, Seidlin regularly taught at the Middlebury Summer School up to 1957, and he often spent the remaining summer weeks with Cunz and Plant on holiday at the beach of Manomet, Massachusetts, where they hobnobbed with the vacationing Hannah Arendt. In the following years, Seidlin's political outlook shifted strongly to the right under the influence of Arendt's concept of totalitarianism yoking together Nazism and Stalinism. Starting in 1954, Seidlin traveled frequently to West Germany to give guest lectures. In 1957, following Blume's departure from Ohio State for a position at Harvard University, Cunz was tapped to chair the German Department in Columbus. He and Seidlin contracted to have a house built in the suburb Worthington that was completed in 1958, and in 1961 both were relieved by the addition of central air conditioning. These were the happiest and most productive years in Seidlin's career.Seidlin chronicled his years working alongside Cunz in \\"The History of the Department of German of the Ohio State University, on the Occasion of the University's Centenary\\", available online. In quick succession, he published Essays in German and Comparative Literature (1961), followed by Von Goethe zu Thomas Mann. Zw√∂lf Versuche (1963) and Versuche √ºber Eichendorff (1965), which he personally regarded as his most heartfelt work, in part because he and Eichendorff shared a Silesian upbringing. He also authored the essay collection Klassische und moderne Klassiker. Goethe, Brentano, Eichendorff, Gerhart Hauptmann, Thomas Mann (1972). In 1966, he was named a Regents' Professor at Ohio State University, and he served on the Advisory Council of Princeton University for several terms. The final years Seidlin was alarmed by the leftist turn of literary studies in West Germany and the U.S. in the late 1960s and 1970s and vehemently declined professorships proffered by the University of Mainz in 1966 and the University of Munich in 1968 because of widespread student unrest at West German universities, which he found reminiscent of the events one generation earlier, leading up to totalitarian dictatorship in Nazi Germany.See Gisela Hoecherl-Alden, \\"Upholding the Ideals of the 'Other Germany': German-Jewish Goethe Scholars in U.S. Exile\\", in Goethe in German- Jewish Culture, ed. Klaus L. Berghahn and Jost Hermand (Rochester: Camden House, 2001), pp. 123‚Äì145, here p. 134. He was criticized by some within the profession as an ivory tower conservative at pains to conceal both his gay and Jewish identities,William H. Rey and Henry J. Schmidt, \\"Colloquium: Oskar Seidlin and 'Oppositional Criticism'\\", Monatshefte, vol. 80, no. 3 (1988), pp. 297‚Äì301. See also the characterization of Seidlin as \\"archconservative\\" by Egon Schwarz, \\"Eine kleine Geschichte der miterlebten amerikanischen Germanistik aus subjektiver Sicht\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Literaturwissenschaft und Linguistik, vol. 26, no. 2 (1996), pp. 142-148, here p. 144. and he resigned from the Modern Language Association, regarding it as overly politicized. Following the death of Cunz at age 58 in 1969, Seidlin felt isolated in the Worthington house they had shared and found himself increasingly at odds with Cunz's successor as chair of the German Department at Ohio State University. In 1972, he accepted an offer from Indiana University, where he taught as Distinguished Professor of Germanic languages and literatures until his retirement in May 1979. He published a second, expanded edition of the Brahm- Schnitzler correspondence, and he also reissued his doctoral dissertation on Brahm in a new printing.The correspondence volume bears the dedication \\"F√ºr Hans\\", i.e., for Hans H√∏gel. His final book publication was the essay collection Von erwachendem Bewusstsein und vom S√ºndenfall. Brentano, Schiller, Kleist, Goethe (1979). A selection of Seidlin's correspondence with William Henry Rey (1911‚Äì2007), professor of Germanic languages and literatures at the University of Washington, was published posthumously under the title \\"Bete f√ºr mich, mein Lieber...\\" in 2001.\\"Bete f√ºr mich, mein Lieber...\\": Oskar Seidlin-- Willy Rey Briefwechsel, ed. William H. Rey (Oldenburg: Igel-Verlag, 2001), 217 pages. Written between 1947 and 1984, these letters document that Seidlin was increasingly tormented by self-doubts about his teaching performance and needed the tranquilizers Miltown and Valium to enter the classroom. Deeply depressed by the passing of Dieter Cunz, he chose to undergo electroshock treatment in 1970. In 1972, he found a new partner in the 35-year-old Hans H√∏gel, whom he visited regularly in Denmark and with whom he vacationed in the Great Smoky Mountains and the Caribbean.Seidlin described his relationship with H√∏gel in his correspondence with William Rey (see note 15). See also Albrecht Holschuh, \\"Oskar Seidlins 'Letzter Sommer in D√§nemark'\\", Germanic Review, vol. 62, no. 1 (1987), pp. 2‚Äì9. In 1982, he moved into the newly built Indiana University Retirement Community, an assisted living facility. A heavy smoker, he suffered a heart attack in June 1984 and was diagnosed with a malignant tumor at the beginning of October; he died nine weeks later. In accordance with his wishes, his mortal remains were interred alongside those of Dieter Cunz at the Walnut Grove Cemetery in Worthington. Achievements and awards Internationally recognized for his adeptness at close reading and text-immanent literary interpretation, Seidlin lectured widely in the U.S. and West Germany. His essays cunningly revealed how seemingly minor details and apparent coincidences meld seamlessly into the higher order of a literary artwork, and his writing aspired to an expository virtuosity that matched the dignified elegance of his public presentations. He wrote over 200 contributions to scholarly journals. In 1958, he chaired the Germanic Section of the Modern Language Association. In the summer of 1959, he was named Ford Professor-in-Residence at the Free University of Berlin. In 1961, he received the Eichendorff Medal conferred by the Eichendorff Museum in Wangen im Allg√§u. He was twice the recipient of Guggenheim Fellowships, in 1962 and 1976. In 1963, the Goethe Institute awarded him the Goethe Medal in Gold for meritorious work in the service of German culture in a foreign country. In 1965, he was elected first vice-president of the Modern Language Association. In 1968, he was conferred an honorary doctorate by the University of Michigan and awarded the Prize for Germanic Studies Abroad by the Deutsche Akademie f√ºr Sprache und Dichtung. In 1973, he was elected to the G√∂ttingen Academy of Sciences as a corresponding member. In 1974, he received the Eichendorff Medal of the Eichendorff Society. In 1975, he received the Culture Prize of Upper Silesia awarded by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia and on this occasion delivered an address describing his Silesian boyhood, including the everyday anti-Semitism he had experienced there.Oskar Seidlin, Ansprache bei der Entgegennahme des Oberschlesischen Kulturpreises des Landes Nordrhein- Westfalen, in: Oberschlesischer Kulturpreis des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen 1975.

She was honored as a Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem for risking her life to save twelve Jews from certain death. Life Irena Gut was born into a Catholic family with five daughters in Kozienice, Poland, during the interwar period. The family moved to Radom, where she enrolled at the nursing school before the Nazi-Soviet invasion of 1939. At the age of 20, Gut witnessed a German soldier kill an infant in 1942. This event transformed her life. During the German occupation, Gut was hired by Wehrmacht Major Eduard R√ºgemer to work in a kitchen of a hotel that frequently served Nazi officials. Inspired by her religious faith, Gut secretly took food from the hotel and delivered it to the Tarnopol Ghetto.Joyce Jensen, In Her Hands by Irene Opdyke, International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation. Gut smuggled Jews out of the ghetto into the surrounding forest and delivered food for them there. Meanwhile, R√ºgemer asked Gut to work as a housekeeper in his requisitioned villa. She hid 12 Jews in the cellar. They would come out and help her clean the house when he was not around. R√ºgemer found out about the Jews she was hiding. At risk to all their lives, R√ºgemer kept Gut's secret, and she became his mistress. R√ºgemer fled with the Germans in 1944 ahead of the Russian advance. Gut and several Jews also fled west from Soviet occupied Poland to Allied-occupied Germany. She was put in a Displaced Persons camp, where she met William Opdyke, a United Nations worker from New York City. She emigrated to the United States and married Opdyke shortly thereafter. They raised a family together.  Legacy  After years of silence regarding her wartime experience, in 1975 Opdyke was convinced to speak after hearing a neo-Nazi claim that the Holocaust never occurred. Opdyke began a public speaking career which culminated in her memoir In My Hands: Memoirs of a Holocaust Rescuer. In 1982, Irena Opdyke n√©e Gut was recognized and honored by Yad Vashem as one of the Polish Righteous Among the Nations.Holocaust Memorial Center, 1988 ‚Äì 2007, Opdyke, Irene; Righteous Gentile  Papal blessing  On 9 June 1995, Irene Gut Opdyke was honored with a papal blessing from Pope John Paul II at a joint service of Jews and Catholics held at Shir Ha-Ma'alot synagogue in Irvine, California, along with an invitation from Pope John Paul II for her to have an audience with him. The papal blessing and audience with the Pope had been obtained for her by congregant Alan Boinus with the help of Monsignor Joseph Karp of the Polish Catholic Church in Yorba Linda, California. The papal blessing was the first recognition by the Roman Catholic Church of her efforts during the Holocaust. Irene Gut Opdyke said, \\"This is the greatest gift I can receive for whatever I did in my life.\\"\\"Pope recognizes Yorba Linda woman's WWII sacrifice\\", Lori Haycox, The Orange County Register, 10 June 1995.  ABC Primetime Live trip to Israel  In July 1997, Irene Opdyke traveled to Israel with her manager, Alan Boinus, and his wife, publicist Rosalie Boinus, on a television story arranged by the Boinuses for ABC Primetime Live, which aired on 10 June 1998, re-uniting Opdyke with Hermann Morks, one of the twelve Jews whose lives she saved.ABC Primetime Live air date June 10, 1998 On the trip, Alan Boinus arranged for private meetings with Opdyke at the Knesset with former President and Prime Minister of Israel Shimon Peres and Speaker of the Knesset Dan Tichon. Boinus also arranged for other meetings in Israel for Opdyke with Mordecai Paldiel, Director of the Department of the Righteous Among the Nations at Yad Vashem, and with Holocaust survivor Roman Haller, the baby Opdyke saved during the war by convincing his parents, Ida and Lazar Haller (two of the twelve Jews Opdyke was hiding in R√ºgemer's cellar), that Ida should carry the child to term after she became pregnant while hiding in the cellar. After the war, the Hallers took in R√ºgemer as their house guest for saving their lives. R√ºgemer became \\"Zeide\\" (grandfather) to Roman Haller. Roman Haller served as director of the German office of the Claims Conference, which represents world Jewry in negotiating restitution for the victims of Nazi persecution.Roman Haller and His Zeide ‚Äì How a Jewish couple took in the Wehrmacht officer who hid them by Donald Snyder, The Jerusalem Post  Memoir  Opdyke's memoir, In My Hands: Memories of a Holocaust Rescuer (Alfred A. Knopf; later ), was arranged by her then-manager Alan Boinus and published in 1999 through Random House, with co-author Jennifer Armstrong. Alan Boinus and his wife, Rosalie Boinus, among others, are thanked by Opdyke in the acknowledgements. * *  Irene Gut Opdyke Holocaust Rescuer Foundation  The Irene Gut Opdyke Holocaust Rescuer Foundation was founded in 1997 by Alan Boinus and Rosalie Boinus in honor of Irene Opdyke to offer awards, grants, and scholarships to young people inspired by the heroic acts of Irene Gut Opdyke when she was young, so they may likewise stand up to racism, bigotry, and hate. It has since been disbanded.  Motion picture controversy  In 1998, Opdyke's story was the subject of a legal action and cross-complaint when she sought to regain the motion picture rights to her life story, which she had previously assigned in an option agreement.

She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 20 November 2002. Ang departed in 2003, but returned the following year to reprise her role. She made her last screen appearance as Lori on 20 November 2004. Casting Neighbours' casting director, Jan Russ, was looking at New Zealand actors, when Ang went for an audition. Ang received a callback a few months later. She was nineteen when she joined the cast of Neighbours as Lori and she had to move to Melbourne for filming. Ang became one of the first Asian actors to receive a prominent role in the show. Ang quit Neighbours in 2003 to go back to New Zealand to complete a commerce and science university degree. In April 2004, she returned to reprise her role as Lori. Of her return she said, \\"It felt a bit strange at first, but it is really like stepping into a pair of old shoes. [..] I quickly settled back in and it's easier when you're working with your old castmates because they help you out as well.\\" Development Lori becomes good friends with Connor O'Neill (Patrick Harvey) and they later have a one-night stand. Harvey believed that it was a \\"rebound thing\\" because there was no attraction between them. Connor was missing his girlfriend, Michelle (Kate Keltie), while Lori was heartbroken over Jack Scully (Jay Bunyan). Lori became Connor's \\"shoulder to cry on\\" and it felt right for them both at the time, but the next morning they regret it. Harvey called the situation awkward, stating \\"Connor thinks that Lori might want a relationship, and Lori thinks the same of him, even though that's not the case.\\" Lori later discovered she was pregnant with Connor's child and initially thought about having an abortion, before deciding to keep the baby and leave Erinsborough. Ang revealed \\"Back then she didn't tell anyone what she was going to do about her pregnancy except for Jack.\\" A year later, Connor, who has since reunited with Michelle, runs into Lori and is introduced to his daughter, Madeleine (Madison Lu). TV Week's Jackie Brygel explained that Lori's timing could not be worse, as Connor and Michelle are spending a night at Lassiter's Hotel and Connor has been dared to wear some make-up. Of the situation, Harvey told Bygel \\"Connor is standing there looking like an idiot. Lori says 'Here's your daughter!' He just can't believe it. Everything feels like it's crashing down around him. It's a massive shock.\\" Ang stated that while Lori was planning on introducing Connor to Maddy, she was caught off guard in the lobby and the situation was not ideal for either of them. Ang stated \\"Lori didn't even know that Connor and Michelle had got back together. I'm not sure she would have brought Maddy into Connor's life if she'd known this.\\" Ang explained that Lori had been keen to make things right and make sure her daughter knows her father. She wanted to give Connor the chance to be a father. The actress added that working with Madison, the baby who portrayed Maddy, was \\"quite challenging\\" and that she had learnt a lot. Storylines Lori first arrives in Ramsay Street at the home of her boyfriend, Jack's parents. Within her first few hours at Number 26, she manages to offend Jack's mother, Lyn, with her straight talking and buying a coconut cake, even with the knowledge that Lyn does not like Coconut and causes further grief when she lets it slip that Jack has given up on soccer after being dropped from his team in England and plans to work for her father in New Zealand. Lori and Jack eventually sort things out and decide to repeat Year 12 when the school year commences (partly due to work options being limited and the fact neither of them had completed their schooling prior to living in London). The couple go on Schoolies with Jack's sister, Michelle, her boyfriend Connor O'Neill (who Jack knew while in London), Nina Tucker (Delta Goodrem) and Taj Coppin (Jaime Robbie Reyne). Lori notices Jack is distant with her but he assures her that he is committed to her, despite obviously being attracted to Nina. When Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) writes a play to be performed at the Community Centre, Lori leaps into the project and modernizes it with a space theme in mind with Jack and Nina as the leads, and writes steamy kissing scenes for them, unaware of their apparent attraction. Lori makes an immediate enemy of new principal Candace Barkham (Kate Whitbread), on her first day of Year 12 at Erinsborough High by wearing trousers instead of the regulation school dress for girls. To get back at Barkham, Lori uses an embarrassing photo of Barkham adjusting her underwear, taken by Taj and puts copies all over the school. As the performance of Mission Erinsborough nears, Lori notices Jack being distant and witnesses an exchange between him and Nina but dismisses it as rehearsing. On the evening of the play, Lori cannot hide her jealousy when Nina and Jack share their big kiss. After Nina dumps Taj without explanation, Lori becomes a friend to him and they begin hanging around together. One day, while messing around at a local pool, Lori slips and falls injuring her back. When Lori wakes up in hospital and cannot feel her legs, Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher) informs her that there is no guarantee that she will ever walk again. Lori is later discharged from hospital and returns to the Scullys. When Lori challenges Jack on his moods, he confesses that he has been seeing Nina behind Lori and Taj's backs. Taj walks in at that moment and Jack tries to explain, resulting in a fight on the lawn between the boys. Lori finishes with Jack and feels she cannot stay any longer in the house and move in next door with Karl and his wife, Susan. One day during a massage session with Nurse Dee Bliss (Madeleine West), Lori regains some feeling in her toes and gradually begins to walk again, which is witnessed by Taj. When Taj kisses Lori on the cheek one day, she fears that he may want something more but is relieved when he admits he likes her as a friend. Lori, now back on her feet, enlists the help of Connor to print T-shirts to make some money, even offering to make an advertisement for the Coffee shop featuring Harold in the guise of \\"Afro Harold\\". After Michelle leaves for New York, Lori and Connor begin spending time together and sleep together one night, which both regret. Lori later discovers she is pregnant and Connor is against the idea of being a father and Lori decides to have an abortion. On the day of the scheduled abortion, Connor has a change of heart and tries to talk Lori out of it but she is adamant. However, upon entering the clinic, Lori realises she cannot go through with it and flees in a cab without Connor. Lori asks Jack, of all people to help her pack. Lori leaves two letters; one for the Kennedys thanking them for letting her stay and one for Connor, telling him not to contact her. Lori then leaves for the airport to return to New Zealand. After giving birth a daughter, Madeleine Lee (Madison Lu), Lori returns to Erinsborough the following year to introduce Madeleine to her father. Lori and Maddy arrive at Lassiter's hotel just as Connor and the recently returned Michelle are leaving. Connor is reluctant to accept his new role as a father after having just rekindled his relationship with Michelle, but eventually grows to bond with Maddy. Jack tries to win Lori back and Lori is tempted but Lyn talks her out of it as she fears she may be hurt again. Lori is offered a job by Gino Esposito (Shane McNamara) in his new salon in Lorne and takes it. To test Jack's loyalty, she tells him a lie that Gino needs new male models to go to Europe which he jumps at the chance to do so, confirming Lyn's suspicions. Lori and Maddie then leave for Lorne. On Lori's next return, she is with a new partner, Nick Sullivan (Angus Grant), who is very rude to Connor and tries to keep him out of Maddy's life. Lori apologises for Nick's behaviour and reveals that she, Maddy and Nick are moving to Adelaide. One day, Connor snatches Maddy from her pram at Lassiter's when Nick leaves her unattended. Nick is furious but Lori is understanding towards Connor as she realises that Nick is selfish and she feels it is Maddy's best interest to have regular contact with her father and then promptly tells Nick she and Maddy will not be going with him to Adelaide and dumps him. Lori returns to Lorne and lets Connor keep in touch with Maddy as often as he wants. In 2012, Connor reveals that Lori is marrying a man called Cameron. He attends the wedding and decides to move closer to Lori, so he can spend more time with Maddie. Reception For her portrayal of Lori, Ang was nominated for a \\"Most Popular New Talent\\" award at the 2003 Logie Awards. A writer for the BBC's Neighbours website said Lori's most notable moment was \\"Winding up in a wheel chair after an accident at the pool.\\" References External links *Character profile at BBC Online Category:Neighbours characters Category:Fictional hairdressers Category:Fictional nannies Category:Fictional New Zealand people Category:Television characters introduced in 2002 Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Lori Lee"},{"id":"4889165","text":"Penguins are popular around the world for their unusually upright, waddling gait, their cuteness, their swimming ability and (compared with other birds) their lack of fear toward humans. Their striking black and white plumage is often likened to a white tie suit and generates humorous remarks about the bird being \\"well dressed\\".March of the Penguins (2005) (reel.com) (Archive) Penguins had a resurgence as figures in pop culture in the mid-2000s thanks to films like March of the Penguins, Madagascar, Happy Feet, and Surf's Up.Susan Glaser, \\"Penguins are pop culture's hottest thing\\", The Seattle Times (Tuesday, December 19, 2006). As an April Fools' Day joke, on April 1, 2008 the BBC released a short film of penguins in flight and migrating to the South American rainforest. Portrayals The penguin is typically depicted as a friendly and comical figure, with considerable dignity despite its physical limitations. Perhaps in reaction to this cute stereotype, fictional penguins are sometimes presented as irritable or even sinister. Examples include the cute yet somewhat surly Sanrio character Badtz Maru and the penguins in the movie Madagascar, intelligent creatures with devious schemes and plans, who are even capable of defeating humans. Penguins are also often portrayed as friendly and smart, for example in the anime Neon Genesis Evangelion, which features a warm-water penguin named Pen Pen. *The 1960s television cartoon character Tennessee Tuxedo would often escape the confines of his zoo with his partner, Chumley the walrus. *In the online role-playing game RuneScape, penguins are portrayed as devious characters with a background reminiscent of the Soviet Union: their capital is Palingrad (suggesting Stalingrad); they have KGP (compare KGB) agents; and they refer to their homeland as the \\"Motherland\\". One quest in which they feature is called \\"Cold War\\" and the next is called \\"The Hunt for Red Raktuber\\", a play on The Hunt for Red October. They have an enormous military complex with training facilities, living areas, interrogation rooms and agility courses. They have plans for domination similar to the penguins in Madagascar. *In the animated series Wallace and Gromit, a penguin called Feathers McGraw disguises himself as a chicken with a red rubber glove. *A villain in the DC Comics Universe is called The Penguin.

Although this was edited out in reruns of the episode, it had already caught the attention many supporters of democracy, and they ridiculed the vice-chair and the entire DAB for it, saying that it is common knowledge that penguins are native to only the south, and that if the next generation of party leaders should have such poor general knowledge, it would be questionable for them to lead Hong Kong.

They had several hits, including The Other Me, written by Jimmy Griffin and Michael Z. Gordon (1967). The Surprise Package was one of the top 60's Northwest contemporary rock bands from the greater Seattle area. They were originally called the Viceroys, and had a Northwest instrumental hit called Granny's Pad. The band consisted of Greg Beck (guitar, vocals), Kim Eggers (lead vocals & Sax), Michael Rogers (piano, organ, bass, vocals) and Fred Zeufeldt (drums, vocals). In 1966 after doing some Dick Clark Where the Action Is tours and shows with their friends Paul Revere and the Raiders, they recorded some songs on Columbia Records, produced by Jerry Fuller. During a mixdown session, Lou Adler (the Mamas and Papas producer) suggested the name 'The Surprise Package' to replace the dated 'Viceroys' handle. They recorded four songs under Fuller's production: Eastside, Westside, Going Out of My Mind, The Merry Go Round, and The Other Me, written by Jimmy Griffin and Michael Z. Gordon in 1967. Unfortunately, Columbia apparently had too many artists to market, so The Surprise Package got very little promotion. In late 1967, Kim Eggers left the band and singer Rob Lowrey was hired to replace him. In 1968 they recorded an album called Free Up for Lee Hazlewood's LHI-label, which spun off two singles as well: the title track and their version of MacArthur Park in 1969. In 1970, Mike Rogers left the band, they then added Gene Hubbard on keys and became American Eagle.

He made his first on-screen appearance on 20 January 1986. Mike's storylines included being physically abused by his father, moving in with Des and Daphne Clarke, making friends with Charlene Mitchell and Scott Robinson, his relationship with Jane Harris and becoming a teacher. Mike departed Erinsborough to be with his mother on 6 December 1989. Creation and casting When he was 18, Pearce's drama teacher advised him to write to TV companies asking for auditions and he wrote to the Grundy Organisation, which produced Neighbours at the time. Pearce was then cast as the troubled and lonely Mike Young. Following his last year 12 exam, he began filming on 3 December 1985. Pearce's debut was in episode number 171, the first episode broadcast on Network Ten following the show's move from Seven Network. In 1989, the Neighbours producers did not want Pearce to play Errol Flynn in a biopic film and Pearce decided to leave the show. Of being a part of Neighbours, Pearce said \\"I experienced hysteria at a pretty high pitch with that show\\". Pearce also added \\"I'm not embarrassed by having done it now, not at all. It was an amazing experience, an amazing opportunity. And I was only 18.\\" Storylines Mike and his mother, Barbara (Rona McLeod; Diana Greentree), lived in fear of being beaten and abused by Mike's father, David (Stewart Faichney), throughout Mike's young life. This meant Mike grew up into a lonely, quiet young man who did not socialise much until he began attending Erinsborough High School and becomes good friends with Charlene Mitchell (Kylie Minogue) and Scott Robinson (Jason Donovan). Through his friendship with Scott, Mike comes to Ramsay Street and befriends Scott's neighbour, Daphne Clarke (Elaine Smith), who cares for him, later giving him a part-time job at her coffee shop. Mike opens up to Daphne and Des (Paul Keane) about his problems at home with his father and Daphne tries to get Mike and Barbara away from David. However, Barbara is too scared of her husband and she does not want to leave, but Mike is determined to go and moves in with Des and Daphne when they offer to become his legal guardians. Mike briefly dates Scott's cousin Nikki Dennison (Charlene Fenn), but he later falls for Jane Harris (Annie Jones) when she moves in with her grandmother, Nell Mangel (Vivean Gray). Jane falls for Mike straight away, but it takes a while before Mike realises his feelings due to Jane's plain image. Helen Daniels (Anne Haddy) and Daphne give her a makeover for a school dance, which consists of replacing her glasses with contacts, a new haircut and makeup. Mike likes her new image and they begin dating. Mrs Mangel is not happy that her granddaughter is dating Mike and when she receives letters about Mike's reputation with other girls, Mrs Mangel stops Jane from seeing him. Daphne eventually catches school bully, Sue Parker (Kate Gorman), posting the letters and Sue explains that she is jealous of Mike and Jane's relationship. Mrs Mangel then lets Jane and Mike continue dating. When Nikki returns to Ramsay Street, Mike helps comfort her when she discovers her mother is ill, leading Jane to become jealous of their friendship. Mike becomes jealous when Shane Ramsay (Peter O'Brien) shows an attraction to Jane, but she tells Mike that he is the only one for her. Following their final exams, Jane focuses on her modelling career and Mike decides to become a teacher. As they are leading separate lives, Jane and Mike split up amicably and remain friends. Not long after, Daphne is killed in a car crash and Mike is left feeling guilty as he had not been around for a few weeks. Mike is angry and upset and he finds the two men who had crashed into Daphne's car. He attacks them and is later arrested. When Mike finishes university, he gets a job teaching Maths at Erinsborough High. Mike becomes close to one of his students, Jessie Ross (Michelle Kearley), who admits that she has an abusive father too. Mike confronts her father, Ted (Doug Bennett), but soon learns that her mother Adele (Marian Sinclair) is the one abusing her. Mike becomes close to Jessie and they share a kiss, which is witnessed by principal Kenneth Muir (Roger Boyce). Mr Muir suspends Mike, who decides to leave Erinsborough for a while. On his return, Mike finds Des and Jane have forged a strong friendship. Mike becomes moody as he settles back in. When Jenny Owens (Danielle Carter) comes to see him, it is revealed that Mike and Jenny took a ride on his motorbike and had an accident. Jenny fell from the bike and was left paralysed and using a wheelchair for the rest of her life. Mike blames himself for Jenny's condition and could not bring himself to accept that the event was an accident. Jenny eventually convinces him that it was not his fault. At the same time, Des and Jane begin dating and Mike is disgusted with the both of them. He refuses to accept the relationship and leaves Erinsborough again. He returns in the middle of Des and Jane's engagement party and he interrupts it. Mike eventually accepts that Des and Jane love each other and gives them his blessing. Mike begins to feel like there is not much left for him in Erinsborough and when he hears that his mother had been in a plane crash, and with his father long dead, Mike decides to leave Ramsay Street and join her to help her recovery. Reception A writer for the BBC's Neighbours website stated that Mike's most notable moment was when he saw Jane's \\"transformation at the school dance.\\" In 2010, to celebrate Neighbours' 25th anniversary Sky, a British satellite broadcasting company, profiled 25 characters of which they believed were the most memorable in the series history. Mike is in the list and describing him they state: \\"The Erinsborough economy is studied the world over for being the only one in the world that can sustained on just four professions: you can work in 'business', or be a journalist, a doctor, or a teacher. Mike chose the latter, probably because he was the nice, fairly quiet boy out of the legendary original set of teens on the show. His romance with plain Jane Harris unfortunately ended up with her engaged to his father figure of a friend, Des, one of many reasons why he left the show to care for his sick mother.\\" Heat magazine called Mike \\"cheesy, but gorgeous\\".

It was originally transmitted on 26 December 1976. Synopsis A church bazaar is organized for the \\"Comforts for the Troops Fund\\". Hodges intends to auction three oranges, and Mainwaring is determined to get hold of one for Mrs Mainwaring. Plot The platoon are parading in their snow camouflage suits so they can blend in with the snow, if there was any. Jones' glasses are completely white except for two small, dark holes in the middle because he has highly colored eyes. He also has cotton wool pushed up his nostrils, because he claims that his nostrils flare. Pike is wearing a white sheet over his head because his mother would not let him put whitewash on his face. Frazer is dressed in his mother's wedding dress (it was all he could find) and Godfrey is wearing a pierrot costume he wore, complete with pompoms, for the Army and Navy Stores Christmas party, where they made up a troupe called the Gay Gondoliers. The Vicar and the Verger interrupt the parade and inform Mainwaring of a church bazaar they are holding for the Comforts for the Troops Fund. Mainwaring naturally takes charge, and forms a small executive committee. Godfrey will provide chutney and homemade wine, Frazer will draw silhouettes, Mrs Pike will run a jumble sale, Mrs Fox will perform fortune-telling in a gypsy tent, Mrs Mainwaring will provide lampshades, Mrs Yeatman will organise the tombola, and Jones will auction a monster brawn. Hodges shoves his oar in by declaring he will auction three oranges, much to the committee's surprise. The bazaar opens, and Mrs Mainwaring's lampshade stall is empty, and Mainwaring tells Wilson that Mrs Mainwaring had an unfortunate incident with the bath (their bath had been recently enameled, and the enamel paint came off in one long strip, making an enamel skirt around her as she prepared to take a bath), and she won't be coming. Mainwaring admits to Wilson that he would only be embarrassed by the lampshades anyway, but it turns out that Pike picked them up from Mainwaring's house. Jones and Pike carry Jones's brawn into the yard, as it is melting in the heat. Mainwaring tries to win a bottle of whisky from the tombola stall, but loses out to the Vicar. When he notices the town clerk and some of his men drunk, he confronts Godfrey, who admits that everybody's tasting the wine, but nobody's buying it. A dispatch rider arrives with a message but, when he leaves, his motorcycle runs over Jones' brawn, making it unsellable. Mainwaring finds that Sponge is selling the lampshades as funny hats. Just as Hodges announces the auction of the oranges, Mainwaring tells Wilson that he must get one of the oranges for Mrs Mainwaring. The Verger overhears and warns Hodges, who resolves to stop Mainwaring. The first orange is sold for 1 shilling to Mrs Yeatman, before Mainwaring had finished bidding. The second orange is withdrawn from the sale because Mainwaring was the only bidder. Wilson tells Pike to buy the orange for Mainwaring. As a result, the orange eventually sells for an enormous 10 shillings. Mainwaring brings Jones' section into the office. Mrs Mainwaring rings and tells Pike that she's gone to stay with her sister for the weekend. Pike tells her about the orange, but she promptly slams the phone down. Mainwaring therefore decides to share the orange with Wilson and Jones' section. Suddenly Hodges comes bursting in and tells Mainwaring that they'll find the orange rather bitter: it's for making marmalade with.

Joel made his first on-screen appearance on 13 May 1998. He departed on 29 January 2002. Character creation and casting Neighbours casting director, Jan Russ, auditioned MacPherson and she approached the script producers and suggested they write the role of Joel for him. MacPherson joined the cast in February 1998, when he was seventeen, and he moved from Sydney to Melbourne for filming. \\"I'm not ashamed to say I bawled my eyes out that night going, 'What the hell am I doing? I've never acted, I've never lived out of home, I've never been to Melbourne, I've never been on a TV set. What the hell am I thinking?'\\" MacPherson left the show in January 2002, of his time in Neighbours MacPherson said \\"I learned so much. I watch it now and again just to see what everyone's doing. I'd love to go back for maybe a couple of days or weeks just to see everyone but, as for a career choice, probably not\\". Character development Whilst travelling, Joel meets and becomes friends with Malcolm Kennedy (Benjamin McNair) and he comes to Ramsay Street \\"out of the blue\\" to stay with the Kennedy family. Upon his arrival, Joel was described as being \\"good- looking, down-to-earth, friendly and a champion triathlete.\\" Inside Soap called Joel a \\"heart-throb\\" and said that he appears to be Mr Perfect. However, MacPherson told them that Joel is unlucky in love, saying \\"A couple of the girls throw themselves at him, but he's no naive he doesn't really notice.\\" The BBC said \\"Being a fit, young tri-athlete, Joel certainly set a few hearts a flutter among the Ramsay St girls.\\" When Anne Wilkinson (Brooke Satchwell) crashes her car into a riverbank, Joel and Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher) are first on the scene and try to help her. The car slides down the riverbank and Joel becomes trapped underneath the vehicle. A storm causes the water level to rise rapidly and Karl tries to help Joel breathe. Filming for the stunt took three days and McPherson spent most of his time underwater. He said \\"Luckily , that meant I didn't have too many lines to learn, half the time I had to just sit under the water, hold my breath and wonder if they were still shooting!\\" Joel is eventually rescued and taken to hospital and McPherson told Inside Soap that there is a chance that Joel may not be able to walk again due to his injuries. The actor said \\"That is a tremendous shock. The triathlon is his life.\\" Joel tries to keep his injury from his sponsors, but Karl reveals to them that Joel may not walk again. Joel is \\"absolutely furious\\" with Karl and McPherson said \\"I think in his heart of hearts, Joel knew they would find out eventually, but he hasn't learnt how to deal with the consequences yet.\\" Joel then faces a long recovery process, but he has a \\"good chance of pulling through.\\" Joel has a brief relationship with Natalie Rigby (Nicki Paull), a woman ten years his senior. Joel meets Natalie after auditioning to be a stripper and she asks him for a date. Natalie reveals that she has a teenage son, but refuses to introduce Joel to him until she is sure their relationship is serious. Joel and Natalie argue and Soaplife said Joel feels \\"belittled\\" by Natalie's over-protective attitude towards her son. The magazine added \\"Emotional baggage and not the age gap ruined the relationship in the end, as Natalie put her son first.\\" Daniel MacPherson (pictured) plays Joel. Joel begins a relationship with Dee Bliss (Madeleine West), which progresses steadily. Joel later finds himself \\"immediately drawn\\" to Dee's best friend, Carrie Clark (Vanessa Rossini), after Dee introduces him to her. MacPherson explained, \\"It's quite a complicated situation. He is over the moon about Dione, but I think it's a little more lust than love.\\" Joel tries to keep his feelings about Carrie to himself, but Soaplife said this is not easy as his eyes \\"practically pop out of his head every time Carrie's name is mentioned.\\" MacPherson said that Joel does not want to hurt Dee, but inevitably when feelings for someone become strong the truth comes out. West revealed that Dee feels awful after realising that Joel likes another woman, but the situation becomes worse for her as she becomes aware that it is Carrie Joel likes. Of Joel's love triangle storyline, Soaplife said \\"After playing the singles game for such a long time, you would think he'd want to focus all his energies on one girl. But it seems one lovely lass is not enough for him!\\" Joel is delighted when his father, Bernie (Sean Scully), arrives in town, but he is unaware that Bernie has been flirting with Dee. Of the interesting storyline, MacPherson said \\"Joel has Bernie up on a pedestal, but it turns out he's the last one to find out what he's really like. Everyone else can see that he has his faults, but nothing they can say or do make Joel realise it. He just thinks his old man is the best.\\" Joel is \\"quite cut up\\" when he realises that his father is not the hero he perceives him to be. McPherson said the storyline was good for his character as everyone got to learn more about his background. After their relationship ends, Dee is keen to remain friends with Joel, while Joel finds it awkward and wants them to get back together. Joel eventually moves on with his friend and neighbour Felicity Scully (Holly Valance). The official website said that they are \\"two of the sexiest residents in Ramsay Street\\" and that it was not surprising they would be getting together. The website said that up until now there has not been any attraction between Joel and Felicity. McPherson said Joel had always been aware of Felicity, but because he was dating Dee he just did not think about her. After Lance Wilkinson (Andrew Bibby) asks Joel and Felicity to star in his film, they have to kiss in a scene and McPherson said \\"they do a little more acting than is strictly necessary!\\" The actor said Joel backs off straight away and pretends it did not happen because Felicity is in high school and is \\"probably a little too young for him.\\" However, Lance and Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) tease Joel about the kiss and Felicity's crush, so he cannot get away from it. Felicity invites Joel to the Erinsborough High debutante ball as her partner and McPherson explained that she is not exactly truthful, saying \\"Flick asks Joel to be her partner, and says it's because she can't find anyone else to go with. But she's actually already asked Paul, and as you can imagine, it leads to a bit of strife!\\" Storylines Joel was born to Bernie and Brenda Samuels (Pixie Jones) in Launceston, Tasmania in 1979 and grew up wanting to be a triathlete, which he pursued upon dropping out of a Marine Biology course. While in London, Joel met Malcolm Kennedy and the two quickly became friends. Malcolm told Joel that he would always be welcome in Ramsay Street, where his parents lived. Joel arrives in Ramsay Street at Malcolm's parents place and introduces himself to Malcolm's mother Susan and younger brother, Billy (Jesse Spencer). Karl, Malcolm's father has reservations about Joel staying as the Kennedys hardly know him but relents. Joel later settles in and makes friends and catches the eye of Hannah Martin (Rebecca Ritters), who has a crush on him and goes through the effort of buying a takeaway meal and passing it off as her own in order to impress him. Hannah is crushed when Joel tells her he only likes her as a friend. Joel later gets a job at Across the Line, a local sports store and later falls for Libby (Kym Valentine), Malcolm's sister. Joel is too scared to tell her his feelings but she eventually figures it out and the pair remain friends. After a number of problems at the Kennedys', including the breakdown of Karl and Susan's marriage, Joel moves in next door to Number 30 with Sarah Beaumont (Nicola Charles) and Toadfish Rebecchi. Toadie later introduces Joel to his co-host, Sally Upton (Sally Davis) at Uni FM, the radio station at Eden Hills University. Joel and Sally begin dating but things fall apart after Sally becomes jealous of Joel's closeness with Libby and accuses him of cheating. When Joel decides to join the Ramsay Street teenagers at a campsite to celebrate the end of Year 12 and exams, Karl offers him a lift. When they drive by a river bank, they find Anne Wilkinson sitting in a bogged down ute by the riverbank crying. Joel and Karl stop to help and begin to push the vehicle from the front, but the vehicle slips down the bank and traps Joel's knee. As the water level rises due to drains bursting and a heavy downpour of rain, Karl battles to keep Joel breathing during the rise. Joel loses consciousness and Anne raises the alarm. After being airlifted to Erinsborough Hospital, Joel wakes up and Sally visits him. Joel thinks she wants to get back together, but she tells him of her attraction to his friend, Drew Kirk (Dan Paris). Sally leaves and Joel finds it hard to be positive. Joel's mother, Brenda visits but she has a hard time getting close to her son as he has made so many friends in the community. Joel is later discharged from hospital and moves back in with the Kennedys temporarily, as Toadie and Sarah are finding his mood swings difficult to live with. When Joel recovers, he takes part in a routine based on the movie The Full Monty along with Bill, Karl, Drew and Toadie. Joel later meets Natalie Rigby, the manager of a pub when he auditions as a solo stripper and they begin dating, but are opposed by Natalie's son, Liam (Damien Bodie) and the relationships fizzle out. After a while of being single, Joel and Toadie decide to go out one evening to Foxy's in February 2000, a local nightclub and meet Dione Bliss and her friend, Vanessa Bradshaw (Julieanne Tait) on under the pretence of Joel being an Argentine Footballer and Toadie being a lawyer (a partial truth as Toadie is studying law). The girls ultimately see through this but play along and during one date leave the boys stranded at Italian restaurant, Lanzini's when the time comes to pay the bill. Dione later reappears and Joel falls for her but cheats on her with her friend, Carrie Clark. Joel is dumped and goes out of his way to win Dione back. They get back together but their reunion is fraught with jealousy problems and things are not made easier when Joel's father, Bernie arrives and tries to make advances towards Dione every chance he gets. Dione tells Joel who disbelieves her at first but then he comes to realize Dione is telling the truth about Bernie and soon sends his father packing. Joel and Dione begin playing jokes on each other, but Joel ultimately takes it too far when he enlists Malcolm's help by pretending to be a distant relative of Joel's interested in Dione's art. This proves too much and Joel and Dione split once again. After helping Lance Wilkinson film a home-made Sci-Fi movie, where he and Felicity Scully are the leads who share a kiss, Joel agrees to be Flick's date to Erinsborough High's debutante ball. As the ball nears, Joel finds himself falling for Flick. At the after party Joel and Flick spend all night talking and they share a kiss the next morning by the pool. Joel and Flick try to keep their relationship a secret but gradually their neighbours and friends find out. Flick's father, Joe (Shane Connor) catches the couple together one evening and angrily confronts Joel and pushes him, injuring his shoulder. Flick refuses to return home after this and stays with Joel. When Flick opts to move out after Joe comes down hard on her, she suggests that she moves in with Joel. Joel realises things are moving too seriously and decides to join the Kennedys on a trip to London to attend Malcolm's wedding to Sarah's sister, Catherine O'Brien (Radha Mitchell). When Joel returns, problems still have not eased and things don't get any easier when Flick moves in temporarily much to the annoyance of Toadie and Dee. After an argument with Flick on her 18th birthday about spending so much time with Dee, Joel breaks up with her and is chastized by Dee and Joe for doing so on Flick's birthday of all days. Flick later begs Joel to take her back but he tells her they are not right for each other. Joel and Dee become close again and begin dating. This is nearly wrecked when Joel accidentally tells Darcy Tyler (Mark Raffety), Dee's ex-boyfriend that she had previously miscarried his baby. Dee is furious but forgives Joel. Joel begins diving with marine Biologist Vernon Wells (Vincent Gil), who soon offers him a job in Queensland. Dee agrees to go with him but on the day Joel leaves, she changes her mind and they share one final kiss at the docks and Joel walks away and sets off on his journey. Reception Upon Joel's arrival, Robin Oliver of The Sydney Morning Herald said \\"We sent them Jason and Kylie and now the Poms have sent us Daniel Macpherson, who plays newcomer Joel Samuels and has survived the first week of coaching at the pool. Just what Erinsborough needs, a Pom to teach Aussies how to swim. But no doubt it'll give the UK ratings a lift. Joel was told by best pal Mal Kennedy to stay at his parents' place, but Mal forgot to tell anybody, so the week has been spent clearing that up. Stretch things thin, don't they?\\" In 1999, MacPherson received a Logie Award for \\"Most Popular Male Talent\\" for his portrayal of Joel. In 2001, MacPherson was nominated for \\"Most Popular Actor\\". The BBC said Joel's most notable moment was \\"Almost dying while being pinned under a ute in a river.\\" Viewers voted Joel's rescue from beneath the car in the river the \\"Best storyline of 1999\\" in the Neighbours.com Awards. Inside Soap called the storyline one of the show's \\"most dramatic moments.\\" In 2010, Joel was included in a TV Week poll to find the Top twenty-five Neighbours characters. The character was popular in terms of his appearance. Nick Levine of media and entertainment website Digital Spy included MacPherson in a picture feature on male soap stars. Holy Soap called Joel a \\"beefcake.\\" Lorna Cooper of MSN also commented on Joel's \\"Hunky\\" appearance, saying \\"In effect, he was Neighbours' major piece of totty. Joel's sporty prowess was put to good use on the show; I've lost count of the number of times his toned physique was on display.\\" References External links *Character profile at the BBC Category:Neighbours characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1998 Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Joel Samuels"},{"id":"4889256","text":"The Shannon-One-Design sailing dinghy is a small sailing boat raced on the River Shannon and Loughs Ree and Derg in Ireland. The boats are long by beam, drawing with her centreboard down.

The creation of the Shannon-One-Design sailing dinghy came about after a meeting of representatives of Lough Ree Yacht Club, Lough Derg Yacht Club and North Shannon Yacht Club (Lough Boderg) held in the Prince of Wales Hotel, Athlone, on 29 January 1920. The committee commissioned a leading British designer of the time, F.C. Morgan-Giles. Later that year Morgan-Giles delivered the plans.

Eric Goodbody: No. 142. Goodbody: No. 151. Sailing The \\"SOD\\" or \\"Shannon\\" as the class is often called requires three people to race and this produces a very sociable form of sailing. Sailing SODs has always attracted families, and generations in many cases have been involved in campaigning the same boat down through the years. Indeed, many of the same family names that attended that first meeting in 1920 still feature in SOD racing today. The SOD is an exciting boat to sail in a breeze of wind, and a serious challenge to sail well in any conditions. As a result, SOD sailing attracts a wide range of sailors from far and wide, not simply limited to Shannon riverside dwellers. At the two main events each year, the week long regattas at Ballyglass on Lough Ree and Dromineer on Lough Derg, up to 55 SODs have been counted. These will be sailed by a mixture of local sailors and others based in Dublin or elsewhere (as far away as the United States), most of whom return year on year to compete. It is not unusual to have two generations of the same family sailing together in a SOD or even have all three crew-members from the same family. There is also a very healthy influx of younger sailors joining the fleet to compete against older generations. The Shannon One Design Association The Shannon One Design Association (‚ÄòSODA‚Äô) is the governing body responsible for promotion of the class and enforcement of the class rules. In 1989 they sanctioned changes to the original hull and rig plans to take into account new technologies. Background to yacht racing on the Shannon Sailing has flourished on the River Shannon, and especially on Loughs Ree and Derg, for hundreds of years. Initially a means of transport, it gradually became a social event. In the eighteenth century, travel by water was the safest and most convenient way. Therefore, if you were one of those who could say that \\"one lived in a fine house on the shores of a lake or (Cork) harbour\\", it was likely that \\"one\\" kept a yacht as a means of going on house visits. This very quickly evolved into rendezvous for picnics, joint manoeuvres and ultimately competition. Two of these clubs still surviving are the Lough Ree Yacht Club (Ballyglass, Athlone), which traces its origins to 1770, making it the second oldest yacht club in the world, and the Lough Derg Yacht Club (1835) (at Dromineer). Sailing craft have until recently been just that: crafted by hand and eye. Each builder learned ‚Äî and incorporated improvements in each successive boat. Yacht designers did the same, and the sport of yacht racing therefore evolved into a handicap sport as the boats were all different. One Design classes were created to provide more evenly matched racing. In the media In 2010 the second episode BBC television series Three Men Go to Ireland featured the three men, Dara √ì Briain, Griff Rhys Jones and Rory McGrath, racing SODs adjacent to the Lough Derg Yacht Club the previous October.

He was born in Colarich, in the parish of Logierait, Atholl, Scotland, in 1796, and emigrated to Quebec in 1800 or 1801 with his family. They moved to York (Toronto) in 1803. He served in the local militia during the War of 1812 and was captured by the Americans at York. After the war, John and his brothers piloted a number of ships on the Great Lakes. John McIntosh was the caption of the Three Brothers. He was also the proprietor of the Sun Tavern until he sold it to Thomas Elliot who called it Elliot‚Äôs Sun Tavern. He married in 1824 and received enough property from his father-in-law to allow him to retire and devote his time to politics. In 1834, McIntosh was elected in the 4th riding of York as a Reformer; he was reelected in 1836. Although he supported William Lyon Mackenzie during the 1830s, he did not agree with all of Mackenzie's ideas and took no part in the Upper Canada Rebellion. McIntosh's second wife, Helen, was the sister of Mackenzie's wife. He opposed the union of Upper and Lower Canada and was defeated by Robert Baldwin in 1841 when he campaigned for reelection in 4th York. In 1849, he allowed William Lyon Mackenzie to stay at his home after Mackenzie's return from exile on March 22, 1849. That evening a mob assembled at the McIntosh property until several hundreds of Torontonians had gathered. The angry mob vandalized the McIntosh home, despite a police presence, in protest of Mackenzie's return. He died in Toronto in 1853.

Three years later, Vendy auditioned for another role in Neighbours through her agency. Vendy auditioned three times in total and she revealed she was one of three girls up for the role.

The actress said \\"Kristian told me to always think about the motivation of other characters as well as my own.\\" Vendy filmed her first scenes on location at the Erinsborough High set. Two months after her on screen debut, Gina Leros of The Sun-Herald said Vendy would be the one to watch in Neighbours in 2000. Development =Characterisation= Teresa was introduced as a 24-year-old, married English teacher. She moved to Erinsborough to regain her independence and found employment at the local high school. Vendy said Teresa prefers to be called Tess and she described her character as a \\"perfectionist\\", especially when it came to teaching and cleaning. Vendy said while she is not a \\"cleaning freak\\" like Tess, she does share the same work ethic as her. The actress revealed Tess has a vivacious side to her and she has been married to her husband for a couple of years. Vendy told an Inside Soap columnist that she was glad her character had more depth than a bimbo and she said Tess is nothing like the person she thought she would be playing. When asked if it felt strange to be playing a married school teacher, Vendy said \\"Yeah! It is weird because in real life, I have no desire to get married whatsoever! Tess has many more responsibilities than Krista, so it has been interesting to play someone like her.\\" A writer from the official Neighbours website called Tess \\"headstrong and intelligent.\\" =Marriage to Brendan Bell= Shortly after her arrival, Tess makes the decision to leave her violent husband, Brendan (Blair Venn). Vendy said Brendan had been physically and mentally abusing Tess and she was desperate to get away from him. The Kennedy family suspect Brendan has been hitting his wife when they notice a scratch on Tess' face. They ask her to move in with them and Tess opens up about Brendan and his behaviour. Of her character's marriage to Brendan, Vendy explained \\"Tess is a very strong woman, but she has lost a lot of her confidence during the abusive marriage. She is only 24 years old and she looks up to Brendan because he is 11 years her senior and is a successful lawyer. Sadly, he only sees her as a trophy.\\" A writer for Inside Soap said Neighbours rarely strayed from its formula of light-hearted story lines, so when the producers decided to tackle the issue of domestic violence they made sure it would be handled realistically and sensitively. Vendy said to get her head around what Tess was going through, she researched domestic violence and made sure the story line was dealt with carefully. Brendan comes to Ramsay Street to see Tess and he tries talking his way back into her affections. Vendy said despite Brendan's past behaviour, Tess wants her marriage to work and her stubbornness keeps her going back for more. The actress explained \\"She doesn't want to be seen as a failure, or to think she has failed herself. She believes Brendan when he says that he has changed, because she wants to believe him. She doesn't see any of the warning signs.\\" Tess' friends, Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner) and Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne), become alarmed when they learn Tess has allowed Brendan back into her life and they try to warn her about him. However, this just makes Tess want to be with him more and Vendy said Tess and Steph fall out over the situation. Teresa believes Brendan has changed, but she is unaware he has turned on a few people and has shown a split personality. The actress revealed she had received positive reactions about the story line from viewers. =Daniel Fitzgerald= Tess develops a crush on her housemate Daniel Fitzgerald (Brett Tucker) and when she learns he has asked Steph out on a date, she is \\"crestfallen\\". It does not stop her pining for him and even though Dan and Steph fail to hit it off, Tess finds it difficult to live with Dan and she decides to move out. Vendy told Inside Soap's' Jason Herbison that Tess talks to Steph about her feelings and she is told that living with Dan is unhealthy when there is unresolved tension. Tess takes Steph's advice because she does not think Dan will ever see her as more than a friend. She chooses to move out as it is the easiest option. Vendy revealed \\"Tess suggests that Daniel takes over the lease on his own. He is totally shocked by this, and asks her why she wants to move out. Finally, Tess admits that she likes him more than a friend, and that it's hard for her to live under the same roof knowing he doesn't feel the same way.\\" However, Dan then admits he is also likes her. He explains that he has always been attracted to her, but did not do anything about it as it was not long since Brendan died. Herbison stated \\"one might expect this mutual admission to lead to romance\\", but Vendy thought it was not as simple as that. She said that the moment had passed and Tess and Dan had crossed the boundary into friendship and had become too familiar with each other. Dan then makes the decision to move out, saying that if they are to have a chance, they will need some space. Herbison quipped \\"With both Tess and Dan employed as teachers at Erinsborough High, there would seem to be plenty of opportunities for them to get together in the future.\\" Vendy was unsure if the story line would continue as Tucker was not a regular cast member. But she added that it was nice to see Tess so happy while it lasted. =Affair with Darcy Tyler= Tess began an affair with Darcy Tyler (Mark Raffety) in 2001, despite the fact that he was dating her best friend Dee Bliss (Madeleine West). Vendy explained that Tess was \\"a sucker\\" when it came to men and her attraction to Darcy was so strong, that she could not see anything else. Tess believed everything he said, so when Darcy tried to reassure her that he was going to break up with Dee, she does not doubt him. Teresa eventually decided to tell Dee what was going on. Vendy stated \\"Tess is completely under Darcy's spell. Over the past few weeks, Darcy has told her that he doesn't love Dee and wants to break up with her. The only reason he hasn't done it so far is that he doesn't want to hurt Dee's feelings.\\" Tess initially believed him, but she became frustrated and decided to send Dee a letter telling her everything. Vendy thought that Tess felt that everything would be okay between herself and Darcy, even if her best friend hated her for a while. However, Darcy tries to retrieve the letter before Dee reads it, as he actually liked having two girlfriends. Storylines Teresa attends an interview with Susan Kennedy for a teaching post at Erinsborough High. Tess is successful and secures the position. During her first week at the school, Tad Reeves (Jonathon Dutton) is a constant thorn in Tess' side but she ultimately gets the better of him. On New Year's Eve 1999, Tess arrives at Number 28 with a cut on her face and admits to Susan that her husband, Brendan is responsible. Susan sympathizes and helps Tess collect her stuff, only to find Brendan has changed the locks. After smashing her way in with a rock, Tess is then caught by Brendan who tries to put on a calm front, but Susan is not fooled and speaks to former Neighbour Philip Martin (Ian Rawlings) about renting his old house, Number 32 Ramsay Street to Tess. After Tess settles in Ramsay Street and makes friends with Anne Wilkinson (Brooke Satchwell) who moves in with her, Brendan is persistent in her life making it seem like Tess is overreacting about him. Tess then softens after Brendan goes away for a while then returns leaving her flowers. Teresa surprises her students when she comes to school in the same clothes she had been wearing the previous night. When Daniel Fitzgerald moves into Number 32 while his house is repaired, Tess worries how Brendan may react to find her sharing with another man. When Brendan returns, Tess unexpectedly kisses him and the couple move closer together after she lets him stay when his car fails to start. Tess' friends Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine) and Steph Scully are unimpressed with the fact that she has forgiven Brendan but Tess is adamant they can make it work this time. Things become strained with Tess and her friends and when Brendan loses his patience with Paul McClain (Jansen Spencer) and Michelle Scully (Kate Keltie) for nearly running him over on their bikes, Susan mentions it to Tess, but she shrugs it off. Upon Brendan's return, he is incensed to find out from Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) that Tess has gone clubbing. Brendan storms out into a vicious downpour and drives to confront his wife. While on the road he pulls out from behind a bus and collides with Steph and Libby on a motorcycle, injuring the three of them. Tess rushes to hospital and Brendan explains that it was an accident. Tess believes him at first but doubts it when Toadie tells her about the incident leading up to the crash. After Brendan is charged with reckless driving, Tess wonders if she will ever forgive him but Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher) breaks the news that Brendan is dead. Being racked with guilt on top her own grief, Tess tries to build bridges when it is learned that the accident has rendered Libby unable to have children. Everyone realises she was just as much a victim in of this. When Dan returns and begins staying once again, Tess is worried when she becomes more and more attracted to him. Dan reveals that the one person he is interested in is Steph, and likes Tess as a friend. Local nurse Dee Bliss moves in with Tess as her next housemate, but her living habits don't sit with well with Tess at first. After Dee sprains her ankle, Tess has no choice but to let her stay but with some binding house rules. The ladies then become fast friends. When Philip sells the house, Tess and Dee decide to put in a bid but they are beaten by new teacher, Evan Hancock (Nicholas Opolski) on auction day. Tess and Dee then look for new accommodation, with Dee moving next door into the spare room Number 30. Tess, deciding she cannot live in a student environment with Toadie and his friend Joel Samuels (Daniel MacPherson), looks further afield and begins house-sharing with Veronica Anderson (Monika Karwan) in a nearby suburb. Tess later forges a friendship with doctor Darcy Tyler, Dee's boyfriend, which later turns into a love affair. Dee later finds out and exposes the affair in the pub leaving Darcy and Tess humiliated. Tess flees and goes into hiding for a while, ending things with Darcy. Darcy, however, refuses to give up and proposes to Tess, who shocks everyone by accepting. When Tess stumbles upon Darcy's scheme to take over the local surgery and leave Karl jobless, she has doubts which mount up until the day of the wedding. After contacting Darcy's ex-girlfriend, Alice Jamison (Pip Sallabank), Tess decides not to go through with the wedding and stands Darcy up. Before leaving for London to find teaching work, Tess pays Dee a visit and they resolve things. Reception A writer for the BBC's Neighbours website said Tess' most notable moment was Dee's discovery of her affair with Darcy. Jason Herbison, writing for TV Week, proclaimed \\"She may be one of the most beautiful residents in Ramsay Street, but when it comes to men, Tess Bell really doesn't have much of a clue!\\" References External links * Character profile at BBC Online Category:Neighbours characters Category:Fictional schoolteachers Category:Television characters introduced in 1999 Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Teresa Bell"},{"id":"4889279","text":"Chiro Flanders () or simply Chiro, is a Belgian youth organisation, founded on Christian values, active in Flanders, Brussels and Eupen-Malmedy. With more than 100,000 members Chiro is the biggest youth organization in Belgium. While mainly focusing on having fun, it also aims at developing youngsters' responsibility and skills. Chiro is a member of the umbrella of Catholic youth organizations Fimcap. Name The name Chiro is a combination of the Greek letters chi (œá) and rho (œÅ), which are the first letters of Christos, the Greek form of Christ (see Chi Rho). It was introduced by Jos Cleymans in an issue of Het Katholiek Patronaat, describing the youth of Chiro (Chirojeugd).  History  The Chiro movement emerged from meetings for children after the mass on Sunday called \\"\\" teaching Catholic values. In 1934 the Jos Cleymans, a priest and from 1932 secretary of the Flemish Youth Union for Catholic Action (JVKA), used for the first time the term \\"Chiro\\" to name the youth movement. The approach of the movement became less formal and changed to an emphasis on playing and activities. He tried to transform the , now called Chiro, into a modern youth movement. At the same expressive practices like banners, songs and marches were introduced to make a common identity of the groups of the movement visible. Cleymans was inspired by the German Catholic youth movements \\"Quickborn\\" and \\"Neudeutschland\\" as well as by the Scouting movement. During World War II Chiro formulated a concept for its youth work encompassing three pillars: # Chiro was structured in different sections based on age groups. Youth was led by youth. Each section was led by a foreman and an assistant. # Chiro developed a system of requirements. # Chiro introduced a creed. The creed was a poetic text describing an ideal to live. In the beginning Chiro was an organization only for boys. Later also girls groups of Chiro were founded and also mixed groups emerged. Today there are 282 local groups for girls only, 237 for boys only and 397 mixed groups. Structure The members are divided into several sections according to their age. This division is not strict and not always applied in every individual group. * Ribbels: 6‚Äì8 years old (not in every Chiro group) * Speelclub: 8‚Äì10 years old, if there are ribbels, else 6‚Äì9 years old * Rakwi: 10‚Äì12 years old, if there are ribbels, else 9‚Äì12 years old (rakkers (boys) & kwiks (girls)) * Tito: 12‚Äì14 years old (tippers (girls) & toppers (boys)) * Keti: 14‚Äì16 years old (kerels (boys) & (girls)) * ': 16‚Äì18 years old Badges of Chiro symbolizing the belonging to one of the different age groups: \\"Ribbels\\" (violet), \\"Speelclub\\" (yellow), \\"Rakwi\\" (green), \\"Tito\\" (red), \\"Keti\\" (blue) and \\"Aspi\\" (orange) Notable Chiro members * Bert Anciaux (former Minister for Culture, Youth and Sport in the Flemish Government) * Rutger Beke (triathlete) * Jean-Luc Dehaene (politician, he later transferred to scouts) * Luc De Vos (Flemish singer Gorki) * Stijn Devolder (cyclist) * Piet Goddaer (singer: Ozark Henry) * Marc Herremans (triathlete) * Leif Hoste (cyclist) * Oliver (Eurosong for Kids 2008) * Kris Peeters (former Minister- President of Flanders, former Belgian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Employment, member of the European Parliament) * Thor Salden (Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2006) * Herman Schueremans (CEO Rock Werchter) * Peter Van de Veire (radio presenter) * Stan Van Samang (actor, singer) *Els Van Weert (former Undersecretary for Sustainable Development and Social Economy, former leader of the social-liberal party \\"spirit\\") * Johan Verminnen (singer) * Inge Vervotte (politician) For a more elaborated list, please refer to the Chiro website.  Chiro Organizations worldwide  Belgian Missionaries brought the ideas of Chiro into third-world countries. Today there are Chiro organizations in the Philippines (since 1952), Burundi, South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, D. R. Congo (as \\"Kiro\\") and Haiti (as \\"Mouvement Kiro D'Haiti\\", since 1960).

Until the reorganization of 1999 it had been assigned to Suwa≈Çki Voivodeship. It had a population of 3,062 inhabitants as of December 31, 2004. Ryn is located between Lake Ryn and Lake O≈Ç√≥w. Among the notable landmarks of the town are a former Ordensburg castle of the Teutonic Knights (erected ca. 1337) and a 19th-century Dutch windmill. Below the castle in the center of the town, a subterranean channel connects the Matussek pond, a shoaled bay of Lake O≈Ç√≥w, with Lake Ryn and the pond of a mill built by the Teutonic Knights. History The castle in Ryn Grand Master Winrich von Kniprode of the Teutonic Knights built a fortress on the site of a former Old Prussian fortification in 1337. A settlement near the castle was first mentioned in documents in 1405. It was known as Ryne after the Rhine River, and was included within the komturship of Balga. Ryne later became known in Standard German as Rhein and in Polish as Ryn. Since the 15th century the population was mostly Polish.S≈Çownik geograficzny Kr√≥lestwa Polskiego i innych kraj√≥w s≈Çowia≈Ñskich, Tom X, Warsaw, 1889, p. 101 (in Polish) After the outbreak of the Thirteen Years‚Äô War the castle was captured by the Prussian Confederation, at the request of which in 1454 King Casimir IV Jagiellon signed the act of incorporation of the region to the Kingdom of Poland. Later on, it was captured by the Teutonic Knights and was repeatedly besieged by the Confederation troops. After the Second Peace of Toru≈Ñ in 1466 it remained part of the Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights, a Polish fief. The Komtur Haus zur Ryne was established in 1393, after which Rhein was the seat of a Komtur first until 1422; the Komturship was re-established in 1468, following the Second Peace of Toru≈Ñ. From 1466 The first Komtur of Rhein was , brother of Teutonic Grand Master Konrad von Wallenrode, while the best-known one was Rudolf von Tippelskirch, who was also involved in the colonisation of Prussia. After the secularisation of the State of the Teutonic Order Rhein was part of the Duchy of Prussia, a vassal state of Poland, in 1525, an \\"Amtshauptmann\\" office was established in Rhein, which remained in use until 1775. In the 16th century the town's and district's population was almost entirely Polish. During Tatar attacks in Masuria, the village was burned down on 7 February 1657, and many inhabitants were kidnapped. In 1657 the Duchy of Prussia regained independence from Polish hegemony. Town center In 1701 Rhein became part of the Kingdom of Prussia. Between 1709‚Äì1711, it suffered from plague. Despite these setbacks, King Frederick William I of Prussia granted the town its town charter in 1723. The decisive reason for this was the role of Rhein as an administration center for a larger rural area. At that time church services were held only in Polish. During the Napoleonic Wars, soldiers took up quarters in Rhein. The development of the town largely stagnated during the 19th and 20th centuries. It was not until 1902 that Rhein received a railroad connection, though it was only a one-track link of a light railway with a narrow gauge. Additionally, the castle was bought and converted into a prison in 1853, and suffered a fire in 1881, after which it was not fully rebuilt until thirty years later. Rhein was administered by Landkreis L√∂tzen within East Prussia from 1818‚Äì1945. The town became part of the German Empire after the unification of Germany by Prussia in 1871. As a result of the treaty of Versailles the 1920 East Prussian plebiscite was organized on 11 July 1920 under the control of the League of nations, which resulted in 1,460 votes to remain in Germany and none for Poland. After World War II the region was placed under Polish administration by the Potsdam Agreement under territorial changes demanded by the Soviet Union. Most Germans fled or were expelled and replaced with Poles expelled from the Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union.

It has a campground alongside Two Medicine Lake. From the period starting in the late 1890s until the completion of the Going-to- the-Sun Road in 1932, Two Medicine was one of the most visited sections of the park. Once part of a larger chalet complex, the Two Medicine Store is located along the shores of Two Medicine Lake and the building is a National Historic Landmark. The region is a starting point for many trails and tourboats take visitors out on Two Medicine Lake, where the steep south face of Rising Wolf Mountain towers above the lake. The region was considered sacred ground by several Native American tribes including the Blackfeet and they performed Vision quests here. Aside from Chief Mountain, the Two Medicine area is the most sacred section of the park to the Blackfeet. From the Two Medicine Store, several hiking trails lead west and north from the area. Three lakes dominate the area, including Lower Two Medicine Lake, which is also on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, Two Medicine Lake, which is the location of the campstore and the scenic boat rides, and Upper Two Medicine Lake which is a hike from the trailhead. Here are some of the best hikes. 1\\\\. Hike around Two Medicine Lake about 7 miles. Along the way add a side trip to Twin Falls, a beautiful split waterfall. This will add two miles. Then take another side trip to Rockwell Falls, another three miles to a cascading falls over many rock ledges. Then don't forget to take in Aster Falls on the South Shore, a mere .2 miles off the trail. Hitting all of the falls will give you a nice 11.5 mile trip around the lake. Other features are a meadow, beaver pond that often has moose in it as well as a hanging bridge. 2\\\\. Scenic Point, located on the left hand side of the road before you reach the lake. A nice 6.2 round trip up a mountain with just over 2,000 feet of elevation gain.http://www.hikinginglacier.com/scenic-point.htm 3\\\\. Hike to Upper Two Medicine Lake, around 12 miles round trip taking the South Shore or 6 miles if you take the boat across the lake and back.http://www.hikinginglacier.com/upper-two-medicine-lake.htm 4\\\\. The most popular: take the boat across and take a ranger-led hike to Twin Falls, two miles round trip if you return on the boat. Or walk the South Shore and take in Rockwell and Aster Falls on the way back.http://www.hikinginglacier.com/twin-falls.htm 5\\\\. Cobalt Lake--awesome views and a chance to go all the way up Two Medicine Pass. Cobalt Lake is 13 miles round trip on the South Shore and goes past Rockwell Falls.http://www.hikinginglacier.com/cobalt-lake.htm 6\\\\. Dawson-Pitamakan, 20 miles or 17 if you take the boat. This is the big daddy hike with about 3,000 feet of elevation gain, but the views can't be beat. One of the premier hikes in the park.http://enjoyyourparks.com/DawsonPitamakanLoopGlacier.htmlhttp://www.hikinginglacier.com/pitamakan- pass.htm Image:Lower_Two_Medicine_Lake.jpgTwo Medicine Lake References External links  Category:Glacier National Park (U.S.) Category:Regions of Montana Category:Religious places of the indigenous peoples of North America ","title":"Two Medicine"},{"id":"4889321","text":"Knud Torben Christensen (born 19 December 1949), better known by his stage name Sebastian, is a Danish singer, guitarist and composer.

Paine was spotted by the Reg Grundy Organisation and offered the role of Clive. He made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 21 January 1986. Clive's storylines included running a gorillagram agency, setting up a gardening business, saving Lucy Robinson's life and falling in love with Susan Cole. Paine decided not to renew his contract, as he feared being typecast and felt the role was no longer believable. He departed Neighbours on 27 February 1987, but made a brief return in 1989. Paine reprised the role 28 years later, and Clive returned on a semi-regular basis from 9 March 2017. He was reintroduced as the chief operating officer of Erinsborough Hospital. Paine felt that Clive had matured during his time away from Erinsborough, but said his \\"cheeky side\\" would still appear every so often. He was restored to the series' main cast in July 2020. Casting Neighbours marks Paine's first professional acting role. The Grundy Organisation discovered him while he was performing in a college production at the Victoria Arts Centre, and they asked him to come in for a screen test, before offering him the role of Clive.Oram, James, p. 119 Paine almost turned down the role as he looked down on acting in a soap.Apsley, Brenda, Hopwood, Clive and Pemberton, Nick, p. 46 He said \\"I suppose at the time I was a bit too idealistic about the world of acting. Playing a messenger in a gorilla suit might not be King Lear, but at least it pays the rent.\\" Paine later explained that he was reluctant to take the role because of credibility with soap operas. But he was encouraged to take the opportunity and do what he could with the part. He also knew that his experience on Neighbours would be invaluable due to its fast production and high publicity. Development =Characterisation= Stephen Cook of TV Week wrote that Clive was unusual, as his life was not beset with romances and traumas that were typically associated with other TV bachelor characters. He called him \\"a thoroughly 'normal' guy, a young man having a good time and trying to find his niche in life.\\" Paine asked producers not to give his character a romantic storyline straight off, so he would have a chance to enter the series and develop on his own. He told Cook that Clive is trying to work out what he wants to do with his life, which is all he can think about, not that he is not interested in romance. Little is known about Clive when he arrives in Erinsborough, except that he runs a gorillagram agency. Later scenes explored his fictional backstory and revealed that Clive is the son of a wealthy doctor, and he too had a medical career, but became disillusioned with it. He performs an emergency tracheotomy on Lucy Robinson (Kylie Flinker) when she is stung by a bee. Paine explained, \\"Clive tried to reject his medical history, but it was thrown back at him when he had to perform the tracheotomy on Lucy. But he wasn't worried about doing the operation; he just did it.\\" Paine also told Cook that Clive has cut himself off from his family and rejected the lifestyle they set up for him. He is taking responsibility for himself and enjoys the freedom he now has. He added, \\"But he's a serious guy who has made a serious decision to have some fun.\\" Josephine Monroe, author of Neighbours: The First 10 Years, said Clive brought a breath of fresh air to Ramsay Street when he moved in. She described the character as \\"one of life's eccentrics\\" and said he took care of people and often lured them into his latest harebrained scheme.Monroe, Josephine, p. 15 Simon Plant from the Herald Sun said Clive was \\"mild-mannered\\". Dave Hogan and Neil Wallis of The Neighbours Factfile said Clive was \\"cheerful and slightly wacky.\\"Wallis, Neil and Hogan, Dave, p70 They called him the \\"court jester\\" of Ramsay Street, and said he was the model on which the character of Henry Ramsay (Craig McLachlan) was based.Wallis, Neil and Hogan, Dave, p77 Clive's gorillagram agency outraged some of neighbours, particularly Max Ramsay (Francis Bell). Following the character's 2017 return, Paine thought Clive was \\"a different man\\". Where the younger Clive was \\"happy-go-lucky\\", the older Clive has matured and become more conservative. Paine confirmed that Clive's \\"cheeky side\\" would still appear every so often. He also said that he enjoys playing the character, as he is \\"fun and irreverent\\". =Departure= After little more than a year in the role, Paine decided not to renew his contract after fearing that he may be typecast. He also wanted to develop his acting abilities in stage productions, having gone straight from drama school to Neighbours. Paine later explained that Clive was too nice and the role was no longer believable. He said, \\"Clive was becoming just too good to be true. I mean, the guy was only 24 but he spent every spare minute either fixing someone's love life or Daphne's coffee machine.\\" He did not regret leaving the show despite its popularity at the time, and was pleased with the career direction he took. In July 1989, Kevin Sadlier of The Sydney Morning Herald said that during research for an article on the show's 1000th episode, he heard of a plan to bring back a popular cast member from the previous year, and speculated that it was Paine. Paine went on to make a brief return later that year. =Reintroduction= In a December 2016 interview with Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy, Neighbours executive producer Jason Herbison teased the return of a series regular from 1986 to 1987. Herbison said the character would return in a recurring capacity and would be seen in \\"a work environment\\". Paine's management later confirmed that he had reprised his role as Clive. Paine told Johnathon Hughes of the Radio Times that he had enquired about a return through his agent and the show's producers agreed to bring the character back. Paine also said that he had been asked to return numerous times since his departure, but he had always been busy with his acting career or personal life. Clive made his return during the episode broadcast on 9 March 2017. He was introduced as the Chief operating officer (COO) of Erinsborough Hospital. Paine said that in his time away from Erinsborough, Clive had \\"matured and is bit more buttoned up\\", but he wants to \\"re-establish a part of his life that he enjoyed, which was his time in Ramsay Street.\\" Speaking about Clive's friendly rivalry with Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis), whom he was once in a love triangle with, Paine said that they would have \\"their moments\\", but Clive would not be a push over, especially as he holds a senior position career-wise, while Paul is something of \\"a wheeler dealer\\" and tends to get what he wants. He thought it would be interesting to see how they get on during the future. The character was added to the opening titles in July 2020 despite not being a full-time cast member. Herbison stated that Paine will continue appearing on a semi-regular basis, but Clive was added to the titles due to his popularity, adding \\"We've included him in the titles to reflect Dr Clive's importance to the community and we know the fans wanted it too ‚Äì including fan club president Colette Mann!\\" =Relationship with Sheila Canning= Paine teased a potential romance for Clive following his reintroduction, commenting \\"anything is possible\\". Shortly after, a relationship was established between Clive and Sheila Canning (Colette Mann). Both actors were glad to be paired up for the storyline, as they had previously worked together in a stage production and had known each other for a number of years. The couple get off to a bad start when Clive wrongly accuses Sheila's granddaughter Xanthe Canning (Lily Van Der Meer) of stealing hospital medication. They clash a few more times, before Clive asks Sheila out on a date as he thinks she is \\"fiery, and a bit barmy.\\" Mann commented that Sheila loves that Clive is the COO of the Erinsborough Hospital, but she is wary of his intellect. Paine thought Clive and Sheila were very different people, but found that Sheila \\"harks back to Clive‚Äôs gorilla-gram days, she loosens him up and brings out his cheeky side, and she enjoys the affection that comes back her way. The relationship has happened organically through our chemistry. Clive describes Sheila as provocative and irritating but he's enjoying being with her!\\" Clive and Sheila's relationship is initially short lived, after she receives a letter from a former partner, who is ill and wants to see her. Mann confirmed that Herbison had promised to reintroduce Clive into Sheila's life \\"with a big bang\\". Storylines Clive runs a gorillagram agency from Number 22 Ramsay Street, which upsets neighbour Max Ramsay. Clive and Max clash right away, but Clive manages to win over the other residents. Clive invites Daphne Lawrence (Elaine Smith) to move into his spare room when her engagement to Des Clarke (Paul Keane) falls apart. They are briefly joined there by Daphne's best friend, Zoe Davis (Ally Fowler) and then by Mike Young (Guy Pearce). As well as running his gorillagram business, Clive teamed up with Shane Ramsay (Peter O'Brien) to form a gardening business called Ramsay and Gibbons Gardening Service or RAGGS. Clive's real profession is revealed when he saves Lucy Robinson's (Kylie Flinker) life after she is stung by a bee and cannot breathe. Clive performs a Tracheotomy on Lucy on the Robinson's kitchen table and saves her life. Clive tells his neighbours that he is a doctor, but he quit medicine when he made a mistake, which led to the death of his girlfriend, Linda. Clive's brother, Graham (Peter Harvey-Wright), a GP visits with his wife, Kate (Jenny Seedsman) and daughter Vicki (Charmaine Gorman). Clive realises that Graham would badger him about returning to medicine and he tells him about Linda's death. Graham continues to badger Clive until he agrees to become a doctor again. Graham and his family leave after Alex Carter (Kevin Summers), a robber threatens them. Clive befriends Susan Cole (Gloria Ajenstat) and offers her and her son, Sam, a place to live. Clive falls in love with Susan, but she falls for her boss, Paul Robinson. When his uncle Ted (Max Meldrum) comes to visit, Clive asks Susan to pretend to be his wife in order for Clive to say he is a successful family man. Susan agrees, but Ted sees her kissing Paul and confronts Clive. Clive tells Ted the truth. When Paul rejects her, Susan is comforted by Clive and he tells her that he is in love with her. Susan accepts a marriage proposal from Clive, but as Clive starts planning a wedding, Susan realises that she does not love Clive and she leaves Erinsborough. Clive suffers from depression and takes his anger out on Paul. He eventually bounces back and decides to move into the flat behind his surgery before leaving Erinsborough. Two years later, Clive makes a brief return and stays at Number 28 while Des is away and makes friends with Melanie Pearson (Lucinda Cowden). He also provides Paul with a shoulder to cry on following the end of his marriage. Clive gets a call from Graham who is injured in an accident and needs someone to run his surgery in the country. Clive then leaves Ramsay Street again for the outback. Nearly 28 years later, Clive returns to Erinsborough as the new COO of the local hospital. He meets with David Tanaka (Takaya Honda) and Aaron Brennan (Matt Wilson) to discuss the public opening of the new spinal unit. He later catches up with Paul in The Waterhole. After a meeting about attracting donors, Aaron asks Clive for his help in finding a record of David and his brother Leo Tanaka's (Tim Kano) father, as they were born in a Western Sydney hospital, where Clive once worked. Jasmine Udagawa (Kaori Maeda-Judge) offers to make a donation to the spinal unit if Clive calls off his search. Clive later tells David that he could not find any information on his father, before admitting to Paul that he had already called in the favour when Jasmine offered him the money. Leo confronts Clive about accepting a bribe from Jasmine, but Clive tells him that there was no information about their father, but Jasmine was unaware when she made her donation. Clive interviews Brooke Butler (Fifi Box) for a fundraising job, but Sheila Canning warns him that Brooke is a scam artist, before she tries to take back what she said. However, Clive reveals that he has spoken to Paul and Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher), who confirmed Sheila's allegations, so he will not be offering Brooke the job. A few months later, Clive asks Karl to investigate some missing morphine. He finds Sheila checking up on her granddaughter, Xanthe and asks her out to lunch, but she cancels when Xanthe is accused of taking the morphine. Clive comes across Sheila in the city and he helps her to search Xanthe, who has run away from school. Clive and Sheila spend the rest of the afternoon together and Clive asks her out on a date to an art gallery. Clive and Sheila spend a lot of time together in the ensuing weeks, and he mentions to her that he has at least two children. Their relationship ends when Sheila is contacted by her former partner, Russell Brennan (Russell Kiefel) Sheila tells Clive that she needs to know the relationship is definitely over, before moving on with him. Clive vouches for Nick Petrides (Damien Fotiou), an oncologist who was arrested for poisoning Paul with unnecessary chemotherapy. Clive's testimony ensures Nick's release from prison so he can advise with Terese Willis's (Rebekah Elmaloglou) cancer treatment. Months later, Sheila offers to help Clive with community outreach for the new hospital wing, before asking if they can rekindle their relationship. Clive is reluctant as he was hurt by their break up. Clive teaches an adult class at the local community centre, which Sheila attends. After the first class, Sheila confronts Clive for being harsh on her and he admits that he still has feelings for her. They arrange a date and give their relationship another chance. Clive allows Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaite) to have the naming rights to the new hospital wing, following a $20 million donation, which upsets Paul. But following Izzy's departure, Clive informs Karl the new wing is cancelled. Karl is left without a job as a result, until Clive offers him a job with research trials. Clive arranges for Ross Wilson to play at The Waterhole for Sheila, but she runs off when she is invited up on stage, and admits that she has been having memory problems. Clive reassures her and run some tests, which show the memory issues are a side effect of her heart medication. Karl suggests implementing an MRI screening program, but Clive rejects the idea for being too expensive. Karl secures funding from Rita Newland (Lisa Kay), who plots to have Clive removed from his job. Clive rejects a remyelination therapy trial for the hospital and backs David for a position on the board, but he changes his vote to Karl, knowing that his position as COO is tenuous. As the trial goes ahead, Clive receives an anonymous call telling him the results have been tampered with and he shuts it down. He later offers Karl a job as a GP. Clive and Sheila break up, and he begins a relationship with Beverly Robinson (Shaunna O'Grady). Sheila is jealous and constantly tries to sabotage their dates. After an argument, Clive and Sheila have sex and begin an affair. Clive eventually breaks up with Beverly for Sheila, and a furious Beverly throws a bucket of manure over Sheila in revenge. Clive goes travelling and when he returns, he and Sheila agree that while neither of them wants to remarry, they are committed to their future together. Sheila is devastated when her son Gary Canning (Damien Richardson) is murdered, and Clive supports her as she grieves. Reception To celebrate the 20th anniversary of Neighbours, a reporter from the BBC asked readers to nominate their twenty favourite obscure characters. Clive was not included in the list, but the reporter revealed they had received many suggestions asking him to be included. They said that Clive's popularity disqualified him and that he \\"lacked sufficient obscurity\\". Another writer for the BBC called Clive the \\"true genius of Neighbours.\\" Lorna Cooper of MSN said Clive was \\"lovely\\", while Tom Adair of The Scotsman dubbed the character \\"wacky\\". A Lowculture writer stated that Clive performing an emergency tracheotomy on Jim Robinson's kitchen table was one of Neighbours' great moments. A BBC reporter agreed, saying Clive's most notable moment was \\"Performing an emergency operation on the Robinson's kitchen table and saving Lucy.\\" Daniel Martin of The Guardian included Clive's 1986 dream on his list of Favourite Christmas Soap Moments. Martin commented, \\"Not the greatest dream sequence in Neighbours history (that gong has to go to the iconic Bouncer's Dream), but this candy-coated reminder to the grim British contingent of how it should be done is burned onto the brains of twentysomethings nationwide. Doctor Clive ‚Äì refereeing a boxing match between Mike and Shane for the heart of Plain Jane Superbrain ‚Äì is knocked out and goes into a bizarre festive dream sequence where the cast were re-imagined as pantomime characters. Clive was Santa, Mike and Shane were Tweedle Dum and Dee, Paul Robinson some nameless panto villain ‚Äì and Scott and Charlene were in Europe pretending to be pop stars.\\" In her 1994 book, The Neighbours Programme Guide, Josephine Monroe revealed that Clive became popular with viewers and his 1989 return was scripted to set up a spin-off series, City Hospital. A pilot was made, but it was not picked up by any television networks.Monroe 1994, p.269. Polly Hudson of the Daily Mirror wondered why Paine did not go on to have an acting career in Hollywood, like \\"mean old Jim Robinson\\", commenting that he was \\"surely the most talented comedy actor of all time\\". Laura-Jayne Tyler of Inside Soap praised Clive's 2017 return, saying \\"Treat of the week was the return of Dr Clive Gibbons to Neighbours.

Samazan hoped the role would help him further his aspirations of becoming a popular Australian actor. He relocated from Sydney to Melbourne for filming and signed a six-month contract, which he later asked to be extended. He made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 13 August 1993. Mark was introduced as the brother of established regular Stephen Gottlieb (Lochie Daddo). The role initially required Samazan to put on a French accent, which he based on his own father's. In order to distinguish Mark from his E Street character Max Simmons, Samazan got a Caesar cut and Mark had a trendy European wardrobe. Mark is a chef, and was portrayed as being \\"down-to-earth\\" and keen to settle down. He attracts the attentions of several female characters, but producers established a romantic relationship between him and Annalise Hartman (Kimberley Davies), which resulted in their engagement. During their wedding, Mark announces that he wants to dedicate his life to God and become a priest. Samazan believed the storyline gave both Mark and Annalise longevity. Mark's religious beliefs annoy his friends and neighbours, and Samazan described Mark as \\"pretty fanatical\\". The storyline led to Samazan's departure, as he felt the producers wanted to take his character in a different direction than he wanted. Mark's exit aired on 29 November 1995, as he leaves Erinsborough to pursue a career as a TV chef. Samazan reprised the role for the show's 35th anniversary celebrations, and his return scenes aired on 26 February 2020. Casting Actor Bruce Samazan joined the cast of Neighbours as Mark, shortly after the cancellation of rival soap E Street in which he starred as Max Simmons. Samazan told Shelli-Anne Couch of The Sydney Morning Herald that he hoped a stint on Neighbours would help him further his aspirations of becoming a popular Australian actor. Samazan initially signed a six-month contract, but he wanted to extend it to make it a year and then decide whether he would continue in the role or look for a new acting job. Joining Neighbours meant Samazan had to relocate to Melbourne from Sydney for filming. Speaking to Brett Thomas from The Sun-Herald, Samazan admitted that he was \\"a little bit rusty\\" because he had not worked for two months after E Street, but thought it was a good thing as the nerves helped him to get his lines right. He continued, \\"That's the best way to get rid of cobwebs. I'm almost nervous and that makes for a better performance because you're really thinking ‚Äì you're thinking all the time. It makes it more of a challenge when you've got to adjust to a new situation.\\" Samazan made his debut screen appearance on 13 August 1993. Development =Introduction and characterisation= Upon his introduction, Mark assumes a French persona as part of a ruse. Samazan had to act with a French accent that he developed with the help of real life experiences. He told Thomas, \\"A lot of the accent is from just listening to my father ‚Äì he has such a rich French accent, even after 15 years of living here and people still have trouble understanding him. So I know how a Frenchman is going to say an English word.\\" It is not long before Mark's real identity is revealed and it emerges that he has come to Erinsborough to reconcile with his brother Stephen Gottlieb (Lochie Daddo). The brothers had fallen out when Mark spiked Stephen's drink, so he was incapable of driving himself and his fianc√©e Libby home. Libby took a taxi instead, but it crashed and Libby was killed. Stephen blamed Mark for causing Libby's death.Monroe 1994, p.61. While talking about their days living with their parents in a hippy commune, where Mark was called Cosmic, the brothers realise that they have lots in common and finally reconcile. Samazan had to change his appearance for the role to distinguish Mark from his E Street character. Mark wore \\"a trendy and expensive European wardrobe\\" and a Caesar cut, which initially shocked Samazan. He called the look \\"very old European\\", but pointed out the short hair was appropriate for Mark's job as a chef. Thomas thought Samazan might have been reluctant to change his look and the actor admitted that it had to be done, as he did not want viewers to confuse Mark with Max. An Inside Soap columnist described Mark as being \\"down-to-earth\\" and keen to settle down. He resented his parents for his upbringing and their \\"backwards ways\\".Monroe 1996, p.71. After moving into Number 30 Ramsay Street, Mark took over the lease of the Coffee Shop and ran a successful business.Monroe 1996, p.72. =Relationship with Annalise Hartman= Mark finds himself torn between two women ‚Äì Gaby Willis (Rachel Blakely) and Annalise Hartman (Kimberley Davies). Mark feels that he has a lot to offer Annalise and that is why he chooses her over Gaby, who is looking for a long-term relationship. Mark sees past Annalise's flirty persona and falls in love with her. Samazan said Mark loved the attention he got from both women, especially when they argued over him. He also told Mary Fletcher from Woman's Own, \\"It was great for Mark's ego ‚Äì and it didn't do mine any harm either!\\" Mark comforts Annalise when her affair with her boss ends and they grow closer when Mark learns more about Annalise's upbringing. Samazan explained, \\"Her own mother was a gold-digger who brought her up to think of men as paycheques. When Mark finds out, he starts to think differently about her and they end up setting up home together.\\" Samazan added that because Neighbours was a family show, there would not be any actual sex scenes between Mark and Annalise, but he thought the audience would know what the couple were up to by their various displays of affection and comments. Despite his relationship with Annalise, Mark continues to attract admirers. First, teenager Danni Stark (Eliza Szonert) develops a crush on Mark and then charity fundraiser Katerina Torelli (Josephine Mitchell) spots Mark out driving with Annalise and also develops a crush on him. Mark and Katerina flirt with each other and Katerina dedicates songs to him on radio, which makes Annalise jealous. While Annalise is away, Mark kisses Katerina. When Annalise finds out what happened, she is shocked that Mark cheated on her, but they stay together. The couple argue more, as Mark becomes broody and wants to settle down, but Annalise does not feel the same way. Samazan thought that Mark was looking for stability in his life, following his upbringing with his hippy parents. He also believed that Mark's mother's death \\"hit him very hard\\" and it made him think more about where his life and relationship with Annalise is heading. A few months later, Mark proposes to Annalise and she accepts. In the lead up to the wedding, Annalise pressures Mark to be baptised and attend church services. As a result, Mark realises that he wants \\"bigger and better things\\" and falls in love with religion. During the wedding, Mark suddenly announces to a devastated Annalise that he wants to dedicate his life to God and become a priest. Samazan told Arnold that he was happy to get the scripts for the storyline, as it meant that there would be more to come from Mark and Annalise's relationship. He said, \\"When I realised there was going to be a bit more longevity for both our characters I was thrilled. I was worried that Mark and Annalise would get written into a corner but there's lots of juicy stuff to come.\\" =Religious views= As the character's \\"religious fervour\\" grows more intense, his more secular neighbours are shown to be annoyed by it. Mark's behaviour causes trouble for his sister, Serendipity Gottlieb (Raelee Hill), and he manages to alienate his friends when he tries to dictate how they should lead their lives. Samazan described Mark as \\"pretty fanatical\\" and thought he should be talking to his friends, instead of ramming his beliefs down their throats. Mark vows to be celibate, but this is tested by his attraction to Lucy Robinson (Melissa Bell). Following \\"a series of narrow escapes\\", Mark starts to have delusions of immortality. When he comes away from a collision with a car without injury, he is convinced it is a sign from God. However, when Lucy leaves town, this causes Mark to have an emotional breakdown and he throws himself further into his religious preaching, which sees him become an outcast. Samazan said \\"He has a very close brush with death and thinks he's invincible. But he's been through some tough times ‚Äì there was his mum's death, jilting Annalise and seeing her get together with Sam, and then to top it all Lucy left him just as he finally fell for her.\\" The character's faith is tested when he starts to feel shut out and he sees Annalise moving on with someone else. The storyline comes to a conclusion when Mark falls from a ladder and ends up in a coma. As Mark lies in his hospital bed, Serendipity becomes \\"increasingly distraught\\" as it seems that no one else cares about her brother. As he wakes up from his coma, Mark comes to his senses and works hard to win his friends back. =Departure and return= The character's religious storyline led to Samazan's departure from the serial, as he felt the producers wanted to take Mark in a different direction than he wanted. He said, \\"I wasn't happy with Mark's character anymore, he had run his course. I don't think I'd ever go back to doing a soap ‚Äì except E Street that is.\\" Samazan departed Neighbours in 1995, along with several other cast members. On-screen, Mark makes an appearance on a cooking show, which leads to a job offer in Sydney. He decides to leave Erinsborough to pursue his new career as a TV chef. On 24 November 2019, Neighbours confirmed that Samazan had reprised the role for the serial's 35th anniversary celebrations. His scenes began airing from 26 February 2020. Samazan thought the opportunity to return for \\"an amazing milestone was a no brainer.\\" He told Maddison Hockey of TV Week that he had been asked to return before, but the timing this time worked out perfectly and he felt honoured to be involved in the 35th anniversary. Samazan was also pleased to have the chance to work with former Neighbours and E Street co-star Melissa Bell again. Storylines After arriving in Erinsborough, Mark assumes the identity of Marcel Amadieu and poses as a French chef to get a job at Lassister's Hotel. Annalise Hartman soon uncovers the ruse and Mark asks her to keep quiet, explaining that he has come to reconcile with his brother Stephen. Mark spiked Stephen's drink during a party, leaving him unable to drive his fianc√©e, Libby, home. Libby took a taxi, which crashed and killed her. Stephen blames Mark for the accident. When Mark visits Stephen at his home in Ramsay Street, he is shocked to find him in a wheelchair following an explosion at the local pub. Stephen suffers a relapse triggered by Mark's arrival. Mark wants to make amends, but Stephen's wife, Phoebe (Simone Robertson) and friend Wayne Duncan (Jonathon Sammy-Lee) want him to stay away from Stephen. Mark perseveres and eventually Stephen forgives him. After Stephen and Phoebe move to Ansons Corner, Mark moves into the house with Beth Brennan (Natalie Imbruglia). Several local women develop crushes on Mark, including Annalise, Gaby Willis and Lucy Robinson. Mark pursues Annalise and woos her with grand gestures. Mark and Annalise soon begin dating and their relationship is fraught with many arguments. Mark receives a letter from his mother, Sally (Jane Little; Helen Rollinson), who is dying of cancer and he finds this hard to take as he has not seen her or his father in a number of years. Mark visits the hippy commune where he and his siblings were raised and clashes with his father, Dave (David Murray; Ivar Kants), but soon relents and makes his peace with Sally on her deathbed. Annalise also attends and things between her and Mark are strengthened. Mark proposes to Annalise and she accepts, but on the day of the wedding, he jilts her and decides he wants to become a priest. This decision hurts Annalise and soon Mark begins alienating his friends when he becomes serious about his new life path and becomes sanctimonious. Mark struggles with his feelings for Annalise, and later tells her he will become a lay preacher, so they can still marry and he can devote his life to the church. Annalise realises that she no longer loves Mark and he leaves to do some charity work. On his return, Mark finds Lucy Robinson working as a go-go dancer at a nightclub. He learns that her marriage and modelling career have both ended, so he persuades her to go and see her family. Mark is attracted to Lucy and he helps her overcome an alcohol problem with counselling. During this time, he buys the lease to the coffee shop from Annalise and renames it The Holy Roll. Mark is impressed with Lucy when she gives a talk about addiction at a youth centre, and they have dinner together. Mark and Lucy have sex, and he is tempted to forgo joining the priesthood to be with her. However, Lucy tells him that she needs to leave Erinsborough and she takes a job in New York. Lucy's departure sends Mark into a depression. After coming away from three minor accidents and a collision with a car unscathed, Mark feels that he is immortal. He alienates himself when his friends and neighbours become fed up of his lectures. When Mark slips and falls while cleaning Lou Carpenter's (Tom Oliver) gutters, he is left comatose for several weeks. He eventually regains consciousness, much to the relief of his sister, Serendipity Gottlieb who has been by his bedside. Mark suffers memory loss, but soon has flashbacks to his pious behaviour and realises he had become unlikeable. Shortly after being released from hospital, Mark briefly dates Annalise's half-sister Joanna Hartman (Emma Harrison), but he feels things are too weird as he was engaged to Annalise the previous year. After realising that being a chef is what he wants to do with his life, Mark sells The Holy Roll. He is then offered a job on the popular television show Healthy, Wealthy and Wise. Mark proves to be a natural in front of the camera and a rival show offers him a hosting job, which is based in Sydney. After encouragement from his house mate Cody Willis (Peta Brady), Mark accepts the job and he has one final breakfast at Number 30, before leaving for Sydney. Mark returns to Erinsborough twenty-five years later to meet with Jack Callahan (Andrew Morley), who is conflicted about whether to return to the priesthood. Mark meets Lucy Robinson, who is also in town for the Lassiters wedding expo, and they reconnect over their shared history. Mark extends his stay and they eventually rekindle their relationship, despite Lucy's concerns about Mark's commitment to his faith. When Mark learns that Lucy has to return to the United States for work, he decides to propose to her and move to New York, so they can be together. Mark and Lucy have a ceremonial wedding on the first day of the expo, before leaving for New York, so Mark can meet Lucy's daughter, followed by a visit to Las Vegas for Lucy's job, and eventually Paris for their honeymoon. Reception For his portrayal of Mark, Samazan earned a nomination for Most Popular Actor at the 1st National Television Awards. A writer for the BBC's Neighbours website said Mark's most notable moment was \\"Calling off his wedding to become a priest.\\" Matthew Clifton, writing for entertainment website Heckler Spray included Mark in his list of \\"The Best Ever Mid-90s Neighbours Characters.\\" Of Mark, Clifton said \\"Joined the soap pretending to be a French chef to get a job at the coffee shop, Marcel Amadeu 'a votre service'. Mark had a religious conversion after nearly been killed by a kitchen knife accident, and in the end jilted strumpet Annalise to become a priest. He also changed the name of the caf√© to The Holy Roll\\". During a feature on Neighbours actors turned pop stars Iain Hepburn of the Daily Record did not remember Samazan's character, saying \\"Bruce played Mark Gottlieb ‚Äì no, we didn't immediately remember him either.\\" Tony Squires from The Sydney Morning Herald disliked Mark's hair during his time on the show, asking him to \\"get rid of the Caesar haircut\\" and branding it \\"unfortunate\\". A Daily Mirror reporter called the character \\"hunky\\". While an Inside Soap writer quipped that Mark was \\"Ramsay Street's unlikely heart- throb\\". A columnist for All About Soap placed Annalise and Mark's wedding at number eight on their twenty greatest soap weddings list. They said \\"Annalise looked more likely to make a priest renounce his vows than drive a man into the arms of the church, but that's exactly what happened when Mark ditched Neighbours' hottest babe at the altar to devote his life to God.

According to tradition, \\"the birds and the bees\\" is a metaphorical story sometimes told to children in an attempt to explain the mechanics and results of sexual intercourse through reference to easily observed natural events. For instance, bees carry and deposit pollen into flowers, a visible and easy-to-explain parallel to the way a man brings about fertilisation. Female birds laying eggs is a similarly visible and easy-to-explain parallel to female ovulation. Possible origins Word sleuths William and Mary Morris Cited in hint that it may have been inspired by words like these from the poet Samuel Coleridge (1825): 'All nature seems at work ... The bees are stirring‚Äîbirds are on the wing ... and I the while, the sole unbusy thing, not honey make, nor pair, nor build, nor sing.'\\" Even earlier instances of this idiomatic expression appear in Thomas Carew's work \\"The Spring\\" (c.1640), in which the cavalier poet uses earth and its change of seasons as a metaphorical depiction of women and their sensuality (The Norton Anthology of English Literature 1696). To abet his ends, Carew alludes to the \\"birds and the bees\\" in lines 7‚Äì8 with the use of \\"swallow\\", \\"cuckoo\\", and \\"humble-bee\\" as seen here (lines included are 5‚Äì8): \\"But the warm sun thaws the benumbed earth/And makes it tender; gives a sacred birth/To the dead swallow; wakes in hollow tree/The drowsy cuckoo and the humble-bee/Now do a choir of chirping minstrels bring\\" (emphasis added; lines 5‚Äì9 from \\"The Spring\\"). Cole Porter Dr. Emma Frances Angell Drake (b. 1849) wrote a section of a publication called The Story of Life which was published in 1909. This piece was later picked up and included in Safe Counsel, a product of the Eugenics movement in the late 19th and early 20th century. The author tells her daughters \\"when you discovered the tiny blue eggs in the robin's nest and I told you that wrapped in each shell was a baby robin that was growing there, kept warm by the mamma bird...\\" the narrative continues on in vague terms without actually describing sexual intercourse. Later she describes the father's role in reproduction like this; \\"Sometimes it is the wind which blows the pollen dust from one plant to the other, and sometimes it is the bees gathering honey from the flowers. As they suck the honey from the blossoms some of the plant dust sticks to their legs and bodies, and as they go to another plant in search of sweets this is rubbed off and so the parts of the father and mother plant get together and the seed is made fertile.\\" Safe Counsel was reprinted at least 40 times from 1893 through 1930 and may have been widely enough repeated to have contributed to the euphemism, \\"the birds and the bees.\\" Several sources give credit to Cole Porter for coining the phrase. One of the musician's more famous songs was \\"Let's Do It, Let's Fall in Love.\\" In Porter's publication from 1928, the opening line for the chorus carried derogatory racial terms like \\"Chinks\\" and \\"Japs\\", which were later changed, sometime between 1941 and 1954, following CBS's recommendation and NBC's adoption of the new \\"birds and bees\\" lyric: > And that's why birds do it, bees do it Even educated fleas do it Let's do > it, let's fall in love In popular culture *Many songs feature this phrase, or an extended version of it; \\"the birds and the bees and the flowers and the trees\\". *John Burroughs, a naturalist who lived and worked in the Catskill Mountains, wrote a small pamphlet called \\"Birds and Bees: Essays\\" in which he explained the workings of nature in a way that children could understand. *Robie Harris has written children's works such as It's Perfectly Normal and It's So Amazing, which have been the center of controversy and book challenges in the United States. *Jewel Akens earned one-hit wonder status with his Era Records single \\"The Birds and the Bees\\" in 1964, which reached #3 on the Billboard Hot 100.

In the telling of the myth, Tiddalik awoke one morning with an unquenchable thirst, and began to drink until all the fresh water was greedily consumed. Creatures and plant life everywhere began to die due to lack of moisture. Other animals conspired against Tiddalik and devised a plan for him to release all of the water he had consumed. This was successfully coordinated by a wise old Owl, when Nabunum the eel made Tiddalik laugh when he tied himself in comical shapes. As Tiddalik laughed, the water rushed out of him to replenish the lakes, swamps and rivers. The legend of Tiddalik is not only an important story of the Dreamtime, but has been the subject of popular modern children's books. In some Aboriginal cultures, Tiddalik is known as \\"Molok\\". The story has been said to describe the Water-holding Frog (Litoria platycephala), from central Australia. The frogs burrow under ground during dry periods, and emerge during the rain to absorb large amounts of water, breed and feed. This allows it to avoid desiccation during drought, a trait not exhibited by most frogs. They were used by Indigenous Australians during times of drought as a source of water. Origin This story originated with the Aboriginal people of South Gippsland, Victoria but has spread worldwide since first being published. Tiddalik is commemorated in a statue in Warwick, Queensland. Various versions of the story were recorded by amateur ethnographers in the late nineteenth century; originating with the Gunai people near Port Albert, approximately south-east of Melbourne. In the original story, Tiddalik formed the area's bays, estuaries, inlets and islands. The substance of the story has changed over time, with different animals being able to make Tiddalik laugh, and many of the modern versions being dissimilar to those of the nineteenth century. The Water-holding Frog (Litoria platycephala) ascribed in modern times to Tiddalik is not found in the area of the legend's origin. It is likely that Tiddalik either refers to a different frog, or is a mythical memory of a time, 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, when the landscape was sufficiently different for the frog's range to extend to the South Gippsland. While the modern story has a happy ending, with water returned for all to use, the original ends in environmental disaster. The flood caused many to drown and others to be stranded on islands. Those stranded were rescued by Borun the pelican, with the end of the tale explaining how the pelican's feathers subsequently changed from all-black to a mixture of black and white.

Five thousand Tokugawa troops, led by Uesugi Kagekatsu, engaged 2000 troops loyal to the Toyotomi at a place called Shigino, across the Yamato River (now called the Neyagawa) from the site of the Battle of Imafuku, which took place several weeks earlier. The Tokugawa troops received reinforcements from Niwa Nagashige and Horio Tadaharu, whose forces included a number of arquebusiers. They brought orders from the Tokugawa commander, Tokugawa Ieyasu, that Uesugi Kagekatsu should withdraw from the battle and take a rest; Kagekatsu insisted that this was an affront to his honor, as the Uesugi traditionally would not retire from a battle in progress.

While working on the project, he was nearly killed in an accident at the Philadelphia Naval Yard where a prototype thermal diffusion isotope separation device was being constructed. The priest of the Philadelphia Naval Yard offered last rites to Kramish, who refused, as he was Jewish. After World War II, he wrote numerous books on nuclear issues. He is perhaps best known for his book The Griffin - the greatest untold espionage story of World War II, about Paul Rosbaud, who passed important scientific and military information from Germany to the Allies. Education Kramish was born on June 6, 1923, in Denver and received his undergraduate degree in 1945 from the University of Denver. He moved on to Harvard University, where he majored in physics and was awarded a master's degree in 1947.Hoffman, Jascha. \\"Arnold Kramish, Expert on Nuclear Intelligence, Dies at 87\\", The New York Times, July 15, 2010. Accessed July 15, 2010. Manhattan Project While still in college, Kramish was assigned to work on the Manhattan Project, working in the special engineering division at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico and at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. While working on a test in Philadelphia on September 2, 1944, Kramish was critically injured in the explosion of uranium enrichment equipment. Two chemists were killed immediately and two soldiers received severe burns in the accident, which occurred while they were trying to unclog an enrichment device which exploded, releasing steam laced with uranium hexafluoride and hydrofluoric acid. Kramish would later call the blast \\"perhaps then the largest release in history of radioactive materials\\". Severely injured and losing consciousness, Kramish declined the assistance of a priest who was offering to administer Last Rites. While recuperating from the severe burns from the incident at a Philadelphia naval hospital, his mother came to visit him by train from Denver, carrying with her a jar of chicken soup on the three-day trip, which she fed him upon her arrival at the hospital, which Kramish would credit for his unexpected recovery. Despite wartime censorship of any details of the incident and secret classification after the war ended, Kramish lobbied the government to memorialize the victims of the accident. Post-war activities After World War II, Kramish worked for the Atomic Energy Commission as a liaison to the Central Intelligence Agency providing intelligence estimates on Soviet nuclear capabilities and worked with Edward Teller on the design and development of the Hydrogen bomb. Physicist Samuel Cohen credited Kramish with being one of the first to obtain accurate information about Soviet efforts and making his best efforts to pass on that knowledge to senior officials. He assisted in the interrogation of David Greenglass, who was one of the atomic spies for the Soviet Union together with Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. He was later employed as a nuclear weapons research strategist by the RAND Corporation. During the 1970s, Kramish was an adviser to the United States Department of State in Paris, and during the 1980s he served as the chair of a study for the Reagan administration that recommended pursuing the development of the Strategic Defense Initiative as a means to protect the United States from attack by strategic nuclear ballistic missiles. He was also an advisor to UNESCO and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on nuclear arms control and security issues. Kramish became a historian of the atomic era, writing The Griffin - The greatest untold espionage story of World War II, about a spy who passed information to the British about the German nuclear energy project to develop an atom bomb for Nazi Germany, using information he gathered from some 500 interviews. In a review of the book, The Washington Post reviewer expressed his regret that \\"it is an ironic tribute to this bookish spy's mastery of his trade that the Griffin remains a surprisingly shadowy figure\\". Though he was frequently contacted as a source for history about the Manhattan Project and the history of the nuclear arms race, Robert Norris of the Natural Resources Defense Council regretted that he was not \\"more forthcoming and generous in sharing what he knew\\". Death A resident of Reston, Virginia, Kramish died at age 87 on June 15, 2010, at George Washington University Hospital due to normal pressure hydrocephalus.Brown, Emma. \\"Arnold Kramish, 87, atomic bomb physicist\\", The Record (Bergen County), July 11, 2010.

Located on the antique Regordane way, the Paris‚ÄìNimes railway line and the road RN 88 (Lyon‚ÄìToulouse), the city has long been a commercial crossroad between the Auvergne, the C√©vennes and the Languedoc. It is one of the gateways of the historic county of G√©vaudan and of the Occitanie region. Langogne is situated in the valley of the Allier, in a mountainous area. It is crossed by the Langouyrou stream that joins the Allier in the north of the commune. The city is overlooked by hills: Margeride, Mount Milan (Beauregard), Bonjour Volcano. The name appears in the corpus of Gaulish toponymy. Mount Milan may have been an oppidum (as suggested by the findings of Roman medals, coins and weapons). It might have been the meeting area of the Gabali tributes that joined Vercingetorix‚Äôs army in their struggle against Caesar. In the Early Middle Ages, the territory belonged to the Viguerie of Miliac, one of the eight composing the Gevaudan. The city itself was founded in 998 by the monks of le Monastier. The medieval town, built around the monastery, took benefit of the Regordane to become an important centre of trade. The stream allows the development of the wool and the textile industry. During the Wars of Religions, the town was plundered in 1568 by the Huguenot troop of captain Merle. The hunting of the Beast of G√©vaudan started in Langogne in 1764. During the Revolution, many religious items were destroyed by fire in the centre of the town 1793. The railway station opened in 1860. Langogne is in direct link to Paris and Nimes. That led to the growth of industry (mainly meat industry) and tourism. The city was liberated in August 1944 by the 1st DB. A march against the Naussac dam was organized in August 1976, with the attendance of well-known activists of this time. In 2002, Langogne charcutiers made the ‚Äúlongest sausage‚Äù in the world (23 km). The town owns several medieval pieces of architecture (houses, ramparts, etc.) as well as a noted corned market built in 1743. Robert Louis Stevenson passed through Langogne on his Travels with a Donkey in the C√©vennes on 23 September 1878. He left descriptions of the countryside but nothing on the town itself, though it was the largest on his trip, and the largest on the GR 70, a long-distance footpath that follows Stevenson's route. > Just at the bridge of Langogne, as the long-promised rain was beginning to > fall, a lassie of some seven or eight addressed me in the sacramental > phrase, ‚ÄòD‚Äôo√π‚Äôst-ce-que vous venez?‚Äô She did it with so high an air that she > set me laughing; and this cut her to the quick.

Langogne is the birthplace of Pierre-Victor Galtier, a prominent animal pathologist of the 19th century, professor at the veterinary school of Lyon.

The boomburb city is densely populated and rings the base, despite the astronomical level of agent orange toxins simply left there for decades. The base is scheduled to begin cleanup by 2019.https://www.reuters.com/article/us- vietnam-usa-mattis/us-prepares-for-biggest-ever-agent-orange-cleanup-in- vietnam-idUSKCN1MR1U4 During the Vietnam War the base was used by the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF). The United States used it as a major base from 1961 through 1973, stationing Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine units there. Origins Bien Hoa is located on quiet, flat grounds in a rural area northeast of Saigon. The French Air Force established an air base, the Base a√©rienne tactique 192, which was very active during the First Indochina War. In February 1953 the French Air Force established a facility at Bien Hoa to overhaul its F8F Bearcats. In April 15 airmen and USAF civilians from the 6410th Materiel Control Group arrived in Saigon to help the French set up their F8F overhaul facility and they were deployed to Bien Hoa. On 1 June 1955, Bien Hoa Air Base became the RVNAF's logistics support base when the French evacuated their main depot at Hanoi. At this time the base had a single by PSP runway. In December 1960, the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group Vietnam (MAAG) requested the U.S. Navy, as the designated contract construction agent for the Department of Defense in Southeast Asia, to plan and construct several jet-capable airfields in South Vietnam, including at Bien Hoa. In December 1961, the American construction company RMK-BRJ was directed by the Navy's Officer in Charge of Construction RVN to begin construction of a new concrete runway, the first of many projects built by RMK-BRJ at the Bien Hoa Air Base over the following ten years. American use during the Vietnam War With the influx of USAF tactical air units in the early 1960s, Bien Hoa became a joint operating base for both the RVNAF and USAF. The USAF forces stationed there were under the command of the Pacific Air Forces (PACAF). Bien Hoa was the location for TACAN station Channel 73 and was referenced by that identifier in voice communications during air missions. Its military mail address was APO San Francisco, 96227. From September 1962 the 33rd Transportation Company (Light Helicopter) arrived with Piasecki CH-21C Shawnee's. A Company, 501st Aviation Battalion arrived during December 1964 with Bell UH-1 Huey's. =Det. 2 4400th Combat Crew Training Squadron/1st Air Commando Squadron (Composite)= 4400th CCTS North American T-28D-NA Trojan Serial 51-3579 wearing South Vietnamese markings flies over Vietnam USAF Douglas A-26C/B-26B-45-DT Invader Serial 44-35663 on the flightine of Bien Hoa Air Base, 1963 On 11 October 1961, President John F. Kennedy directed, in NSAM 104, that the Defense Secretary \\"introduce the Air Force 'Jungle Jim' Squadron into Vietnam for the initial purpose of training Vietnamese forces.\\" The 4400th Combat Crew Training Squadron was to proceed as a training mission and not for combat. The unit would be officially titled Detachment 2 of the 4400th Combat Crew Training Squadron, code named Farm Gate. The unit would administratively and operationally belong to the Air Force section of MAAG Vietnam. Detachment 2A would be the B-26 Invader unit; Detachment 2B would be the T-28 Trojan unit. In late October an advance party from the 6009th Tactical Support Group arrived at Bien Hoa to prepare the base for Farm Gate operations and on 15 November they were joined by Detachment 9, 6010th Tactical Support Group responsible for aircraft maintenance. In late December 4 B-26s arrived at Bien Hoa and began operations. Farm Gate would quickly grow to 4 SC-47s, 4 B-26s and 8 T-28s. In June 1962 2 Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) soldiers guarding the base perimeter were killed by Viet Cong (VC) and as a result CINCPAC Admiral Harry D. Felt recommended the defoliation of the jungle area north of the base and this was carried out by RVNAF H-34 helicopters in July. In May 1962 2 RB-26C night photo- reconnaissance aircraft joined the Farm Gate planes at the base. One of the aircraft was destroyed in a ground accident on 20 October. In July 1963 the 19th Tactical Air Support Squadron was activated at the base, becoming operational on 15 September. Initially equipped with 4 O-1 Bird Dogs and 20 crew. It was tasked with training RVNAF pilots and observers in forward air control and visual reconnaissance. By the end of 1963 it had 16 O-1s at Bien Hoa and had flown 3862 sorties. By June 1963, the USAF presence in South Vietnam had grown to almost 5,000 airmen. As the buildup continued, USAF directed the activation of a more permanent organizational structure to properly administer the forces being deployed. On 8 July 1963 the Farm Gate squadrons at Bien Hoa were redesignated the 1st Air Commando Squadron (Composite) comprising two strike sections, one of 10 B-26s and 2 RB-26s and the other of 13 T-28s, in addition support squadrons operated 6 C-47s and 4 psychological warfare U-10s. Also on 8 July the 34th Tactical Group was established at the base, taking control of the 19th Tactical Air Support Squadron and the 34th Air Base Squadron. In December 1963 U-2 reconnaissance aircraft operating from the base conducted surveillance missions over Laos and North Vietnam. In early 1964 the USAF and RVNAF were only able to provide half of all requested air support. On 11 February a B-26 operating from Eglin Air Force Base lost a wing in flight and this led to the grounding of all B-26s in South Vietnam. With the loss of the B-26s CINCPAC and Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) proposed that they be replaced by B-57B Canberra tactical bombers operating under Farm Gate procedures with RVNAF markings and joint USAF/RVNAF crews. At the end of March 48 B-57s flew from Yokota Air Base in Japan to Clark Air Base in the Philippines. On 8 April the remaining B-26s at Bien Hoa flew to Clark Air Base for scrapping. On 24 March a T-28 lost a wing during a bombing run near S√≥c TrƒÉng Airfield killing both crewmen and on 9 April another T-28 lost a wing during a strafing run and crashed. Two officials from North American Aviation, the manufacturers of the T-28, visited Bien Hoa and reviewed these losses and advised that the T-28 wasn't designed for the stresses it was being subjected to as a close air support aircraft. As a result, 5 older T-28s were retired and 9 newer aircraft were borrowed by the RVNAF and operational restrictions imposed. Despite this augmentation, accidents and aircraft transfers meant that by late May the 1st Air Commando Squadron had only 8 T-28s left but these were retired on 30 May and replaced by more capable A-1E Skyraiders. =B-57 Canberras= Martin B-57B bombers at Bien Hoa Air Base South Vietnam August 1964. Photo shows the aircraft shortly after their arrival, in natural aluminum and unpainted. Aircraft also show their In-squadron identification letters Following the Gulf of Tonkin incident on 4 August 1964, the Joint Chiefs of Staff began a buildup of U.S. airpower in South Vietnam and 36 B-57B Canberras of the 8th and 13th Bombardment Squadrons at Clark Air Base were ordered to Bien Hoa. As the B-57s approached Bien Hoa on the evening of 5 August one crashed on approach and two skidded on the rain-soaked runway colliding with each other and blocking the runway forcing the rest of the flight to divert to Tan Son Nhut Air Base. One of the B-57Bs was hit by ground fire and dived into the ground during approach at Tan Son Nhut and was destroyed, killing both crew members. Ground rescue parties were unable to reach the planes due to strong Viet Cong fire. The deployment of the B-57s would be the first deployment of jet combat aircraft to Vietnam, however as this was a violation of the Geneva Protocols which forbade the introduction of jet combat aircraft to Vietnam, the squadrons were assigned to the 405th Fighter Wing at Clark Air Base and carried out rotational deployments to South Vietnam on a temporary basis. During the next few weeks, more B-57Bs were moved from Clark to Bien Hoa to make good the losses of 5 August and to reinforce the original deployment. The B-57s shared an open-air, three-sided hangar with the RVNAF resulting in overcrowding that forced 18 of the B-57s to be sent back to Clark in October. In late August Detachment 1, Pacific Air Rescue Service was established at the base equipped with HH-43Bs. In October Detachment 4 was established at the base equipped with 3 improved HH-43Fs and in November Detachment 1 was sent to Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base. The HH-43s were responsible for search and rescue, local base rescue and firefighting. With the activation of the 38th Air Rescue Squadron on 30 June 1965 the detachment at Bien Hoa was renamed Detachment 6. In October 1964 the 602nd Fighter Squadron (Commando) was organised at the base equipped with A-1Es. =1964 Mortar attack= On the night of 1 November 1964 a VC mortar team penetrated the base perimeter and launched a 30-minute barrage on the base destroying 5 B-57s, 3 A-1Hs and 1 HH-43 and damaging 13 B-57s, 3 A-1Hs, 3 HH-43s and 2 C-47s and killing 4 U.S. and 2 Vietnamese. The VC claimed to have destroyed 59 aircraft and killed hundreds of U.S. personnel. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended reprisal attacks against the North Vietnamese but President Lyndon Johnson ordered the replacement of the lost aircraft and convened a National Security Council working group to consider available political and military options. On 6 November the RVNAF led by Air Vice Marshal Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥ launched a 32 aircraft retaliatory attack against a VC base area, claiming to have killed 500 VC. On 2 December 1964 the equipment for the conversion of two 1st Air Commando Squadron C-47s into FC-47 gunships arrived at Bien Hoa. The first FC-47 was ready for testing on 11 December and the second on 15 December. The FC-47s began daytime patrols on 15 December with their first engagement on 21 December killing 21 VC. The first night mission took place on the night of 23/4 December. On 19 February 1965 the Bien Hoa-based B-57Bs mission conducted the USAF's first combat mission bombing VC bases in Ph∆∞·ªõc Tuy Province, in contrast to the preceding Farm Gate missions which were ostensibly conducted by the RVNAF, though in reality carried out by the USAF). This strike was, incidentally, the first time that live ordnance had been delivered against an enemy in combat from a USAF jet bomber. The B-57s conducted further strikes from 21 to 24 February and on 24 February USAF units rescued an ARVN unit under attack in the Mang Yang Pass. On 9 March 1965 the Joint Chiefs of Staff formally approved the use of USAF aircraft for offensive operations in South Vietnam, ending the advisory era. From 3 to 6 May 1965 USAF transport aircraft deployed the 173rd Airborne Brigade from Okinawa to Bien Hoa to secure the airbase and surrounding areas and the port of V≈©ng T√†u. =1965 Bien Hoa Disaster= A diagram of where the aircraft were located by tail number and ordnance loaded. The red circles represent the spot where a deceased person was located. Burning aircraft on ramp at Bien Hoa Air Base after explosion Wreckage on parking apron after explosion and fire Aerial view of fire The use of the B-57s in combat continued to increase as the VC stepped up their attacks on ARVN outposts throughout South Vietnam and the jets were also used on Operation Barrel Roll missions over Laos. On the morning of 16 May 1965, 4 loaded B-57s were awaiting takeoff at the base for a Barrel Roll mission, when a U.S. Navy F-8 Crusader made an emergency landing and was being inspected on the ramp. The lead B-57 suddenly exploded and burst into flames causing a chain reaction of explosions destroying other aircraft, fuel and pre-armed ordinance. The explosions destroyed 10 B-57s, 2 A-1Es and the Navy F-8, killed 28 Americans and 6 Vietnamese and wounded more than 100 more and damaged 25 RVNAF A-1s in what was described as one of the \\"worst disasters in Air Force history\\". Among the dead was 34-year-old USAF Major Robert G. Bell, who in 1959 had been one of the 32 finalists for NASA Astronaut Group 1. The Bien Hoa Air Base Vietnam May 16, 1965 Conflagration/Fire Accident Investigation Board concluded that the disaster was caused by the accidental explosion of a bomb on a parked B-57 triggering a series of blasts. The aircraft and the ammunition were stored too close together which allowed the fires and explosions to spread. The accident investigation board recommended improvements. In the face of such experience, engineers initiated a major program to construct revetments and aircraft shelters to protect individual aircraft. The 10 surviving B-57s were transferred to Tan Son Nhut Air Base and continued to fly sorties on a reduced scale until replacement aircraft arrived from Clark AB. As the B-57B was withdrawn from active front-line service, some B-57Bs had to be transferred to Vietnam from the Kansas Air National Guard, and 12 B-57Es had to be withdrawn from target-towing duties and reconfigured as bombers to make good these losses. In June 1965, the B-57s were moved from Tan Son Nhut Air Base to Da Nang Air Base. On 23 June the 416th Tactical Fighter Squadron equipped with F-100D Super Sabres moved from Da Nang Air Base to Bien Hoa. On 13 July 1965 the newly arrived 307th Tactical Fighter Squadron also equipped with F-100Ds arrived at the base. =3rd Tactical Fighter Wing= On 8 November 1965 the 3d Tactical Fighter Wing moved to Bien Hoa, becoming the host unit at the base. The 3rd TFW briefly absorbed the assets of the 1st and 602nd Air Commando Squadrons, however in January 1966 the 1st Air Commando Squadron moved to Pleiku Air Base and the 602nd Air Commando Squadron moved to Nha Trang Air Base. On 8 February 1966 the 90th Tactical Fighter Squadron equipped with F-100Ds arrived at Bien Hoa. F-100 units attached to the 3rd TFW were: * 90th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 8 February 1966 - 31 October 1970 * 307th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 21 November - 6 December 1965 * 308th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 2 December 1965 ‚Äì 25 December 1966 * 416th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 16 November 1965 - 15 April 1967 * 429th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 21 November - 14 December 1965 * 510th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 8 November 1965 ‚Äì 15 November 1969 * 531st Tactical Fighter Squadron, 7 December 1965 ‚Äì 31 July 1970 Other attached units were: * 1st Air Commando Squadron, 21 November- 8 March 1966 * 8th Attack Squadron (later redesignated 8th Special Operations Squadron), 15 November 1969 - 30 September 1970 * 10th Fighter Squadron (Commando), 8 April 1966 - 17 April 1967 * 311th Attack Squadron, 15 November - 15 December 1969 * 602nd Air Commando Squadron, 21 November- 8 March 1966 * 604th Air Commando Squadron, 15 November 1967 - 1 March 1970 In addition AC-47 Spooky gunships of Flight D, 4th Air Commando Squadron were deployed to Bien Hoa. These would later be replaced by Flight C of the 14th Air Commando Squadron with 4 AC-47s. F-5 Skoshi Tiger evaluation In late October 1965, 12 F-5A Freedom Fighters belonging to the 4503rd Tactical Fighter Squadron arrived at Bien Hoa for combat evaluation under a program known as Skoshi Tiger. The planes mostly flew close air support missions near Bien Hoa flying 1500 sorties by the end of December and losing one aircraft to ground fire. On 1 January 1966 the squadron moved north to Da Nang Air Base. The squadron moved back to Bien Hoa in early February and then returned to Da Nang on 20 February performing operations over Laos and across the Vietnamese Demilitatrized Zone against targets in North Vietnam. The squadron returned to Bien Hoa on 8 March completing the evaluation program. The squadron remained in South Vietnam and in April it was redesignated the 10th Fighter Squadron, Commando. On 1 April the first Combat Skyspot Ground-directed bombing radar system was installed at the base. The rapid growth of units at Bien Hoa led to issues of overcrowding and electricity and water shortages which were only gradually addressed throughout 1966, while many units were undermanned for the increased demands placed on them. On 23 February 1967 the base was the loading port for 845 paratroopers of the 173rd Airborne Brigade when they performed the first combat parachute jump of the war in Operation Junction City. 604th Air Commando Squadron A-37A Combat Dragon Program Cessna A-37A Dragonfly 67-14510 of the 604th Air Commando Squadron, 1968 90th Attack Squadron - Squadron Photo, July 1967 On 17 July 1967 the 604th Air Commando Squadron flying the A-37A Dragonfly began arriving at the base to test the A-37 in combat over three months under a program named Combat Dragon. Testing began on 15 August flying 12 close air support sorties daily, increasing to 60 by 5 September. In late October, some of the planes moved to Pleiku Air Base to perform armed and visual reconnaissance missions and night interdiction flights in the Tiger Hound operational area over southeastern Laos. The tests ended successfully in mid-December with only one aircraft lost and the squadron was then attached to the 14th Air Commando Wing at Nha Trang Air Base but it continued to fly out of Bien Hoa. =1968 Tet Offensive and subsequent attacks= In the early morning of 31 January at the start of the Tet Offensive VC and People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) forces hit the base with mortar and rocket fire and then attacked the eastern perimeter of the base, establishing a defensive position in an engine test stand. While the base security moved to attack this VC force, PAVN units infiltrated the perimeter in 3 different places and began firing on the base's III Corps Direct Air Support Center. An ARVN security force cornered a group of VC/PAVN in a supply shed and engaged them with recoilless rifle fire before USAF Security Police and ARVN forces finished them off with grenades and rifle fire. At dawn U.S. Army forces arrived at the base to engage the VC/PAVN. The main gate was near the active runway of the 145th Aviation Battalion, a U.S. Army helicopter unit. The battalion's pilots lived off-base at the Honour-Smith Compound, a villa on Cong Ly Street in the city of Bien Hoa, some 2 kilometers away. Some were on base or made it there before the fire got too heavy and some of the gunships took off to patrol the base perimeters. Later intelligence reported that there were three main VC units that were to attack the base; the most critical attack was to force the main gate, overwhelm the helicopter active area and prevent gunships from taking off. Other attacks were to proceed across open ground to the main Air Force bunkers and to bring mounted machine guns to sweep the base runway. Due to the battle raging at the east end of the runway F-100 fighter operations were curtailed for most of the day while USAF, RVNAF and U.S. Army forces engaged the VC. At about 16:00 two 531st TFS F-100s were launched to the east through the ground-fire with the intent of delivering ordnance on the battle raging on their own airbase. The actual strike was delayed because friendly forces were so close to the enemy forces. After about an hour of waiting the separation between forces was still small but considered adequate for the F-100s to deliver. The F-100 run-ins were from west to east releasing their ordnance in front of their own squadron for impact on the desired targets. This meant that crew chiefs and armorers actually got to see their aircraft in action. At the conclusion of the airstrike the F-100s landed to the east. The after action correspondence from the strike controller credited the airstrike with essentially ending the battle. This is perhaps the only time in USAF history that pilots have conducted a controlled airstrike on their own airbase. USAF losses were 4 killed in action with another dying of a heart attack, while 26 were wounded. VC/PAVN losses were 137 killed and 25 captured. One A-37 and 1 F-100 were destroyed while a further 17 aircraft were damaged. The bodies of the VC/PAVN killed in the attack were buried in an unmarked mass grave on the edge of the base that was only uncovered in 2017. The Tet Offensive attacks and previous losses due to mortar and rocket attacks on air bases across South Vietnam led the Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Nitze on 6 March 1968 to approve the construction of 165 \\"Wonderarch\\" roofed aircraft shelters at the major air bases. In addition airborne \\"rocket watch\\" patrols were established in the Saigon-Bien Hoa area to reduce attacks by fire. On 7 April 1968, following nighttime mortar attacks on the base, 14 C-130s each dropped 4 pallets of 16 55 gallon drums of Napalm over the forested area north of the base which ignited by rockets causing a massive fire across the area. After midnight on 5 May during the May Offensive the PAVN/VC shelled the base twice for 3 hours and then shelled it again at dawn wounding 11 USAF personnel and damaging 13 aircraft, 5 trucks and 3 50,000-gallon rubber fuel bladders. A further artillery attack on 7 May caused minimal damage. On 26 February 1969 as part of the Tet 1969 attacks, elements of the PAVN 275th Regiment prepared to attack the base but were engaged about 3 km south of the base around the village of Thai Hiep. From March 1969 the Combat Skyspot radar site at the base directed B-52 strikes against targets in Cambodia as part of the secret Operation Menu bombings. On 1 September 1969 with the inactivation of the 3rd Special Operations Squadron, the 4th Special Operations Squadron took over its gunship role at Bien Hoa basing 3 AC-47s there until it too was inactivated on 15 December 1969. On 21 January 1970 an artillery attack on the base damaged a C‚Äì123, a C‚Äì7 and a UH‚Äì1. A rocket attack on 27 February damaged 3 A-37s, 2 F-100s and a C-7. Two USAF personnel were killed in these attacks and 74 wounded. =3rd Tactical Fighter Wing phasedown= In 1971, the 3rd TFW was preparing to inactivate and the wing began phasing down for inactivation as part of the American drawdown of forces. On 15 March 1971 the 3rd TFW inactivated at Bien Hoa and was simultaneously activated at Kunsan Air Base, South Korea, taking over the defensive mission there. The 3rd TFW transferred its remaining resources to the 315th Tactical Airlift Wing at Phan Rang Air Base on 31 July 1971. Still flying its A-37s, the 8th Special Operations Squadron was attached to the 315th TAW, but physically remained at Bien Hoa Air Base. Then the 8th SOS was attached to the 377th Air Base Group (later 377th Air Base Wing) at Tan Son Nhut Air Base on 15 January 1972. Base rescue was provided by a daily rotation of 2 HH-43Fs of Detachment 14, 3d Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Group from Tan Son Nhut Air Base. =Easter Offensive= In response to the North Vietnamese Easter Offensive, the U.S. military built up its air forces in South Vietnam under Operation Constant Guard. On 14 April 1972 a turnaround service for F-4 Phantoms was established at the base. In addition a detachment of 6 AC‚Äì119K Stinger gunships and 150 men from the 18th Special Operations Squadron deployed from Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Navy Base. On 17 May, 32 U.S. Marine Corps A-4 Skyhawks of VMA-211 and VMA-311 arrived at Bien Hoa as part of Marine Aircraft Group 12 (Forward). The 8th Special Operations Squadron conducted familiarization flights in their A-37s for the Marines who were soon engaged in the Battle of An L·ªôc. On 21 May Company K, 3rd Battalion, 9th Marines was deployed to Bien Hoa to augment the USAF 6251st Security Police Squadron who were providing base security. The PAVN attacked the base by fire repeatedly with the heaviest attack of 101 rockets on 1 August resulting in 1 Marine killed. Company K, 3/9 Marines was relieved by Company I 3/9 Marines on 10 August. On 10 September an RVNAF ammunition storage dump exploded wounding 4 Marines. On 22 October the PAVN hit the base with 61 rockets. On 29 January 1973 Marine Aircraft Group 12 (Forward), the last U.S. combat aviation unit in South Vietnam, left Bien Hoa. RVNAF use F-5C of the 522d Fighter Squadron/23rd Tactical Wing, 1971 O-1 observation aircraft of the 112th Liaison Squadron/23rd Tactical Wing, 1971 ICCS members talking with the leaders of prisoners who refuse repatriation to North Vietnam, 25 March 1973 On 1 June 1956 the RVNAF's 1st Fighter Squadron (redesignated the 514th Fighter Squadron in January 1963) was formed here equipped with 25 F8F Bearcats, later re-equipping with AD-6s. From this point Bien Hoa became the base of newly formed and continually growing air units. The RVNAF 2311th Air Group, later to become an air wing, and the 311th Air Division were also stationed there and the base supported the greatest number of air combat units than any other in South Vietnam. On 18 March 1964 the newly formed 518th Fighter Squadron began operations from the base with an original strength of 10 A-1Hs, it would grow to 25 aircraft authorized. The RVNAF pilots were trained by crews from the U.S. Navy's VA-152. In June 1964 the RVNAF formed the 23rd Tactical Wing at the base incorporating the 514th, 518th and the newly formed 520th Fighter Squadrons and the 112th Liaison Squadron. The 520th Fighter Squadron would be activated in October. On 1 June 1967 the US Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker presented the 20 F-5As of the 10th Fighter Squadron (Commando) to Vice-President Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥ at the base. These aircraft would be used by the RVNAF to form the 522nd Fighter Squadron, their first jet squadron with training support provided by the USAF Air Training Command. Following the final withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Vietnam in February 1973, Bien Hoa remained a major RVNAF base hosting the headquarters of the RVNAF 3d Air Division and the Air Logistics Command. On 6 November 1973 a PAVN rocket attack on the base destroyed 3 F-5As. On 3 June 1974 the PAVN hit the base with at least 40 122 mm rockets doing minor damage to runways and destroying 500 napalm canisters, but without damaging any aircraft. Other rockets exploded in hamlets surrounding the base, killing and wounding civilians.

Capture of Bien Hoa Air Base PAVN troops storm Bien Hoa Air Base In early April 1975 the PAVN were closing in on the ARVN's last defensive line before Saigon. The town of Xu√¢n L·ªôc stood at a strategic crossroads 70 km east of Bien Hoa and was defended by the ARVN 18th Division. On 9 April the PAVN 4th Corps comprising 3 Divisions attacked Xu√¢n L·ªôc. The 18th Division defended the town tenaciously with air support from the RVNAF 3rd Division at Bien Hoa and the 5th Division at Tan Son Nhut AB. On the morning of 15 April a PAVN sapper squad penetrated the base blowing up an ammunition dump and 4 PAVN 130mm field guns began shelling the base, later joined by 122mm rocket batteries which cratered the runways and severely restricted flight operations. By 19 April Xu√¢n L·ªôc was completely surrounded and the ARVN command ordered its forces there to withdraw to defend Saigon. On 20 April after launching a diversionary attack east of Xu√¢n L·ªôc, the ARVN units in the town broke out and on 21 April the PAVN captured the town. On 25 April the 3rd Armored Regiment which was fighting at the town of Hung Nghia was ordered to withdraw west along Route 1 to defend Bien Hoa. The ARVN formed a new defensive line east of Bien Hoa at the town of Tr·∫£ng Bom which was defended by the remnants of the 18th Division, the 468th Marine Brigade and the reconstituted 258th Marine Brigade, which had disgraced itself during the fall of Da Nang. At 04:00 on 27 April the 341st Division attacked Trang Bom, the initial attack was repulsed but by 08:00 attacks on the flanks broke through and the town was captured with the 18th Division suffering heavy casualties in their retreat. The PAVN then advanced to the town of H·ªë Nai (now T√¢n H√≤a), which was held by the Marines. H·ªë Nai was defended by the 6th Marine Battalion, an M48 tank from the 3rd Armored and Popular Forces. Following an artillery barrage the PAVN attacked H·ªë Nai, but were met by ARVN artillery losing 30 dead and one T-54 tank destroyed before they pulled back. On 28 April the 341st renewed their attack using 5 T-54s supported by an infantry regiment, but were repulsed in 3 separate attacks losing 3 T-54s and many soldiers. On 29 April the entire 341st Division attacked H·ªë Nai and were again repulsed in 2 hours of fighting. At midday the Marines were ordered to withdraw to defend Bien Hoa and Long Binh. Brigadier General Tr·∫ßn Quang Kh√¥i, commander of the 3rd Armored was given responsibility for defending Bien Hoa, although PAVN shelling had rendered the base unusable. Seeing the regular forces leaving H·ªë Nai the PAVN renewed their assault at midnight on 30 April, but the town's Popular Forces fought back and were not subdued until dawn. The PAVN then advanced to Bien Hoa where they were met by the 3rd Armored, at this point the PAVN 4th Corps changed the axis of their advance to the south. On the morning of 30 April the 18th Division and Marines were ordered to retreat from Long Binh to the west bank of the ƒê·ªìng Nai river, while the ARVN 81st Rangers held Bien Hoa Air Base and the 3rd Armored held Bien Hoa. The 3rd Armored was moving from Bien Hoa to attack PAVN forces when they heard the surrender broadcast of President D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh and BG Kh√¥i halted his advance and disbanded the unit. The 81st Rangers had abandoned the base and had moved west of the ƒê·ªìng Nai river when they heard the surrender broadcast and then marched towards Saigon to surrender to the PAVN.

In April 2019 it was announced that the United States Agency for International Development was beginning a 10-year US$183 million project to decontaminate the base of Dioxin caused by Agent Orange defoliant stored at the base during the Vietnam War. The base was described as the most contaminated site in Vietnam and Dioxin had contaminated the soil and waterways. Accidents and incidents *In March 1966 a C-123 of the 311th Air Commando Squadron carrying 6 tons of artillery shells was hit by ground fire while climbing from the base, starting a fire in the left engine, it turned back and made an emergency landing and was destroyed by fire after landing. *On 13 December 1968, a USAF Douglas AC-47D Spooky (#43-49274) collided in mid-air with OV-10 Bronco (#67-14627) while both aircraft were on a night-time combat operation at Truc Giang. Both aircraft attempted to return to Bien Hoa Air Base but the OV-10 crashed, killing both crew. The AC-47D was damaged beyond economic repair when its undercarriage collapsed on landing.

Antoine was the eldest surviving son and heir of Jean I de Cro√ø and Marguerite de Craon, and was a key figure in 15th-century French politics. In 1452, he secured for himself the post of Governor General of the Netherlands and Luxembourg,Richard Vaughan, Philip the Good, (Boydell Press, 2002), 196. and presided over the pro-French party at the court of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy. He was also one of the judges at the trial of John II of Alen√ßon for treason in 1458. Like his father, he led the French and Burgundian armies against Li√®ge and distinguished himself at the Battle of Brouwershaven, fighting against the English. While on a mission to the court of King Charles VII of France, he was implicated in the assassination of Louis of Valois, Duke of Orl√©ans, and as a consequence, suffered torture in the Ch√¢teau de Blois. Having extricated himself from this predicament, Antoine used his power to expand his family's possessions: in 1429 he obtained the lordship and peerage of Le R≈ìulx; three years later, he married Marguerite of Lorraine-Vaud√©mont, daughter of Antoine, Count of Vaud√©mont and Marie of Harcourt, who brought Aarschot to his family as her dowry. In 1437, he married his daughter Jeanne to Louis I, Count Palatine of Zweibr√ºcken, in order to increase his influence in the orbit of the Holy Roman Empire. He acquired Porcien in 1438, and was made Count of Porc√©an and of Gu√Ænes by King Charles VII later in 1455. In 1446, he purchased the Ch√¢teau de Montcornet and completely rebuilt it. In 1455, he proceeded with the building of the Kasteel van Arenberg on the site of a demolished Medieval castle, of which he had destroyed all but one tower; the ch√¢teau would not be completed until 1515, by his grandson, William de Cro√ø. With Charles the Bold, the future Duke of Burgundy, he was at loggerheads, especially after they had clashed over the inheritance of Jeanne d'Harcourt, Countess of Namur. Upon Charles's accession as Duke, Antoine was accused of plotting with astrologers to bring about the Duke's downfall and was compelled to flee to France. In France, he took part in the coronation of King Louis XI and was chosen as a godfather to the future king, Louis XII. It was not until the age of 83 that he reconciled himself with Charles the Bold and was allowed to reclaim his properties in Burgundy. He died either in 1475 or 1477 and was interred in Porcien. Agnes de Cro√ø was his sister and the mistress of John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy (the grandfather of Charles the Bold), by whom she had an illegitimate son, John of Burgundy, who became the Bishop of Cambrai and the Archbishop of Trier.Richard Vaughan, John the Fearless, (Boydell Press, 2002), 236. Several noble families of Belgium and the Netherlands are descended from the eleven illegitimate children of this prelate. The lines of Cro√ø-Arschot-Havr√© and Cro√ø-Roeulx stem from Antoine's two sons, Philippe I and Jean III, while his younger brother, Jean II de Cro√ø, was the progenitor of the only extant line of the family, that of Cro√ø-Solre. All three lines demonstrate a complex pattern of intermarriage, so that estates and titles would stay within the family as long as possible. Marriage and children Antoine de Cro√ø married firstly in 1410, Marie Jeanne de Roubaix (1390‚Äì1430). He remarried in 1432, Marguerite of Lorraine- Vaud√©mont, Dame d'Aarschot (1420‚Äì1477),Richard Vaughan, Philip the Good, 337. daughter of Antoine of Lorraine, Count of Vaud√©mont and Marie of Harcourt, and had six children by her: * Philip I de Cro√ø (c.1433‚Äì1511), his successor. * Jeanne de Cro√ø (1435‚Äì1504), married Louis I, Count Palatine of Zweibr√ºcken. * Jean III de Cro√ø (1436‚Äì1505), progenitor of the line of Cro√ø-Roeulx. * Marie de Cro√ø (c.1440‚Äì1489), who married Wilhelm II von Heinsberg, Graf of Blankenheim (1441-1469). * Jacqueline de Cro√ø (c.1445‚Äì1486), who married Jean IV de Ligne, Baron de Ligne (d. 1491). * Isabelle (or Isabeau) de Cro√ø (c.1446‚Äì1486) References External links *genealogy Category:1475 deaths Category:Knights of the Golden Fleece Category:Burgundian knights Antoine I Category:Grand Masters of France Category:1380s births ","title":"Antoine I de Cro√ø"},{"id":"4889479","text":"Chasserad√®s is a former commune in the Loz√®re department in southern France.

The 24-hour tower clock in Venice that uses double-XII system Clocks and watches with a 24-hour analog dial have an hour hand that makes one complete revolution, 360¬∞, in a day (24 hours per revolution). The more familiar 12-hour analog dial has an hour hand that makes two complete revolutions in a day (12 hours per revolution). Twenty-four-hour analog clocks and watches are used today by pilots, scientists, and the military, and are sometimes preferred because of the unambiguous representation of a whole day at a time. Note that this definition refers to the use of a complete circular dial to represent a 24-hour day. Using the numbers from 0 to 23 (or 1 to 24) to mark the day is the 24-hour clock system. Sundials use 24-hour analog dials‚Äîthe shadow traces a path that repeats approximately once per day. Many sundials are marked with the double- XII or double-12 system, in which the numbers I to XII (or 1 to 12) are used twice, once for the morning hours, and once for the afternoon and evening hours. So VI (or 6) appears twice on many dials, once near sunrise and once near sunset. Modern 24-hour analog dials‚Äîother than sundials‚Äîare almost always marked with 24 numbers or hour marks around the edge, using the 24-hour clock system. These dials do not need to indicate AM or PM. History The ancient Egyptians divided the day into 24 hours. There are diagrams of circles divided into 24 sections in the astronomical ceiling in the tomb of Senemut. Sundial with 24-hour analog dial Sundials use some or all of the 24-hour dial, because they show the position of the sun in the sky. Sometimes, for aesthetic rather than practical reasons, all the 24 hour marks are shown. Medieval clocks often used the 24-hour analog dial, influenced by the widespread example of the astrolabe.Geared to the Stars: The Evolution of Planetariums, Orreries, and Astronomical Clocks, Henry C King, University of Toronto Press; (1978) In Northern Europe, the double-XII system was preferred: two sets of the Roman numerals I to XII were used, one on the left side for the night and morning hours, and another set on the right side of the dial to represent the afternoon and evening hours. In Italy, the numbers from 1 to 24 (I to XXIV in Roman numerals) were used, leading to the widespread use of the 24-hour system in that country. On Italian clocks, though, the I was often shown at the right side of the dial, rather than the top. This probably reflects the influence of the Italian timekeeping system, which started counting the hours of the day at sunset or twilight. In northern Europe, the double XII system was gradually superseded during the 14th and 15th centuries by the single XII (12-hour system), leading to the widespread adoption of the 12-hour dial for popular use. The 24-hour analog dial continued to be used, but primarily by technicians, astronomers, scientists, and clockmakers. John Harrison, Thomas Tompion, and MudgeThe British Museum Clocks, David Thompson, British Museum Press, 2004 built a number of clocks with 24-hour analog dials, particularly when building astronomical and nautical instruments. 24-hour dials were also used on sidereal clocks. The famous Big Ben clock in London has a 24-hour dial as part of the mechanism, although it is not visible from the outside. In the 20th century, the 24-hour analog dial was adopted by radio amateurs, pilots, submariners, and for military use. Today 24-hour analog watches and clocks are still being manufactured today, and are sought after by collectors and enthusiasts. Manufacturers who make 24-hour analog watches include Glycine, Raketa, Vostok, Fortis, Poljot, Swatch, and many others.

The major variation in the design of 24-hour analog dials is the location of midnight and noon. Although always opposite each other, 180¬∞ apart, noon is sometimes at the top, sometimes at the bottom. A few rare variants place noon and midnight at the right and left sides. There is no ambiguity if the 24-hour numbering is used. In the United States, the government and military commonly use 24-hour clocks having noon at the bottom; the variant with noon at the top is far less common. Watches 24-hour chronograph by Hamilton A 24-hour watch is a type of watch with an hour hand that completes a revolution every 24 hours. This type of watch is especially useful for aviators, astronauts, health care professionals, and members of the military. That is, anyone who uses a 24-hour clock or multiple time zones. The face may be arranged in either of two ways: with noon at the top and midnight at the bottom (similar to how one might observe the passage of the Sun over their time zone whilst facing south), or else rotated 180¬∞ with midnight at the top and noon at the bottom (as pictured). Multiple time zones can be displayed by having multiple hour hands or a rotating bezel. The bezel is a ring around the outside of the watch's face. When it is used, the top of the watch always represents midnight (or noon) GMT. The bezel, which also has hour markings, is then rotated so that its numbering represents local time. So, a pilot always has GMT time available for talking to air traffic control and, when they land, only has to rotate the bezel to \\"set\\" the watch to their new local time. Glycine was the first to feature a 24-hour rotating bezel in 1953 with the Airman No.1 Pilot watch. The design became widely known when Rolex designed the Rolex GMT Master for Pan-Am Pilots in 1954. A 24-hour watch with a compass card dial can be used to determine direction when set to local noon and used in conjunction with the sun. Many (but not all) digital watches can be set to show the time in 24-hour format. =Notable 24-hour watch brands= *Akerfalk (Swedish) *Gallet (Swiss) *Glycine watch (Swiss) *Oris /(Swiss) *Poljot (Russian) *Raketa (USSR Russian) *Rolex (Swiss) *Seiko (Japan) *Fort√© (USA) *Slow watch (Swiss) =World time= The World Time clock in Alexanderplatz, Berlin, Germany A common use for the 24-hour analog method of representing time is for showing the way the time of day depends on one's location. A globe, map, or disk can be used. The Willis World Clock, which shows a stylized map of the world, helping to indicate the time in different time zones. In fiction George Orwell uses the 12-hour and 24-hour dials to symbolize the old and new worlds in his novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. The 12-hour dial is a relic of pre-revolutionary society, used to represent the desirable past; the 24-hour dial and time system is the compulsory standard imposed by the Party, and represents both conformity and the undesirable nature of the new world. This theme is famously set in the opening line: :It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. In the 1927 film Metropolis, the opening scene shows both a 24-hour analog clock and a 10-hour (decimal) analog clock, one above the other. Both are used to convey the impression of an alien and highly efficient society. In Jules Verne's science fiction masterpiece 20000 Leagues Under the Sea, Captain Nemo remarks that the clocks in the Nautilus use a 24-hour dial: \\"Now, look at that clock: it's electric, it runs with an accuracy rivaling the finest chronometers. I've had it divided into twenty‚Äìfour hours like Italian clocks, since neither day nor night, sun nor moon, exist for me, but only this artificial light that I import into the depths of the seas!

ATIP information is only readable on CD-R and CD-RW drives, as read-only drives don't need the information stored on it. The information indicates if the disk is writable and information needed to correctly write to the disk. Usage ATIP is used as a method of putting data on an optical medium, specifically: * Manufacturer * Writable/Rewritable * Dye type * Spiral length in blocks * Rated speed * Audio These features are rather important to the function as it lets the drive know if it is writable. If the disc is re-writable, and the ATIP is damaged, it will not be able to write more than once. Also, it lets the drive know what the maximum write speed available for the disc is, and how much space (in blocks) the disc holds. Function Every writable disc has at least four layers: * Disc substrate ‚Äì the bulk of the disc is 1.2 mm thick, and is usually injection molded from polycarbonate plastic. * Recording layer ‚Äì a thin coating of dye on recordable discs, or a sandwich of metals for rewriteable discs. * Reflective layer ‚Äì a thin layer of silver, a silver alloy, or gold. * Protective coating ‚Äì a clear lacquer which is spin-coated over the top of the disc and cured with ultraviolet light. The polycarbonate layer has a spiral pre-groove that is formed when the disc substrate is injection molded against a stamper. The read/write laser in the drive will follow this pre-groove track as it is writing, in order to maintain the spacing between the written tracks with a high degree of accuracy. This spiral has a wobble frequency introduced into it, which the drive can read while it is writing. The drive will synchronize the rotation speed to the reference speed of the wobble signal, allowing it to maintain an accurate linear velocity (the speed of the track as it passes the laser). This wobble is further modulated with a timecode reference signal containing minutes, seconds and frames. This modulated signal is known as ATIP.

He reluctantly accepted the appointment, and was re- appointed the next year. In 1928 he was appointed as acting president. During his tenure, Calvin College received accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. He was adept at finding a middle ground when the board and faculty disagreed over administrative issues. Broene never felt comfortable with the administrative and fund-raising duties attached to the office of president and repeatedly asked to be released from the appointment. The Board of Trustees complied at the end of 1929 but in 1940 again asked him to serve as an interim president for one year.
