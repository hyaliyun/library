(2015): Sharks: An Eponym Dictionary. pp. 219. Pelagic Publishing. . (5 December 1852, in Bonn – 7 February 1937, in Eerbeek) was a German-Dutch zoologist and biogeographer. Weber studied at the University of Bonn, then at the Humboldt University in Berlin with the zoologist Eduard Carl von Martens (1831–1904). He obtained his doctorate in 1877. Weber taught at the University of Utrecht then participated in an expedition to the Barents Sea. He became Professor of Zoology, Anatomy and Physiology at the University of Amsterdam in 1883. In the same year he received naturalised Dutch citizenship. His discoveries as leader of the Siboga Expedition led him to propose Weber's line, which encloses the region in which the mammalian fauna is exclusively Australasian, as an alternative to Wallace's Line. As is the case with plant species, faunal surveys revealed that for most vertebrate groups Wallace’s line was not the most significant biogeographic boundary. The Tanimbar Island group, and not the boundary between Bali and Lombok, appears to be the major interface between the Oriental and Australasian regions for mammals and other terrestrial vertebrate groups. page 3-82 With G.A.F. Molengraaff, Weber gave names to the Sahul Shelf and the Sunda Shelf in 1919. Weber became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1887.

The first DBTG proposals had already been published in 1969. The specification was subsequently modified and developed in various committees and published by other reports in 1973 and 1978. The specification is often referred to as the DBTG database model or the CODASYL database model.

It is wholly owned by Netherlands-based VolkerWessels, a multi-disciplinary construction and civil engineering group.  History  VolkerRail began life as a British Steel subsidiary known as Grant Lyon Eagre Ltd. The company can trace their roots as a contractor in the industry right back to 1935. In 1996 Grant Lyon Eagre Ltd teamed up with Railbouw, based on their existing partnerships, specifically the track renewal works for the London Underground, and became GrantRail. The company continued to expand and formed various subsidiaries; GrantPlant Ltd, GrantRail Signalling Ltd, GrantRail Power Ltd, ALH Rail Coatings Ltd, and GrantWeld Ltd established in 2002. In September 2006 GrantRail also acquired Matrix Power Ltd, which specialised in electrical and power sectors and could privde support for the Power side of the business. In late 2008 VolkerWessels bought Corus' half to take full ownership of the company. Following this, the company became VolkerRail on Monday 2 March 2009. Similarly all the divisions were also renamed to reflect the new order. In February 2010 Gren Edwards stepped down after 18 years at the helm.  Notable VolkerRail Contracts  = Nuneaton Remodelling and Resignalling = In June 2006 GrantRail won the contract to complete the £20 million upgrade of the Network Rail track in the Nuneaton area. This was the final conclusion of a three-stage development that began in 2002. The project was set for 24 months and required the installation of 36 new point ends of switches and crossings, the recovery and plain lining of 37 switch and crossings units, installation of significant lengths of plain line track, signalling mechanical installations, design and erection of 100 new overhead line (OLE) structures, and of new OLE conductors. This new upgrade would allow Network Rail to increase its line speeds and capacity enhancements between Euston and Glasgow. The project was completed in 2008. = Bicester DSDA = GrantRail Projects undertook major works at the Ministry of Defence's (MoD) Bicester Modernisation project in Oxfordshire. The project began in late 2007, with the aim of bringing the east sidings up to modern standards. The 1940s 75 lb flatbottom rail placed on light weight concrete sleepers would be taken out and replaced with 1st generation steel sleepers bedded in ash ballast. The project took place in Bicester MoDs’ Barracks, which operates a non-explosive military storage and distribution hub. This meant that any member of staff that was working on the project had to be security vetted by the MoD before they would be issued the permits to access the site. Members of staff were also subjected to the strict security requirements of working in an operating barracks, however there was the added benefit of being protected by armed guards! The project was completed in 2008. = Nottingham NET project = VolkerRail has been involved in five of the six projects in the UK. One of these was the Nottingham Express Transit (NET) project. This is the transit system that supports the largest city in the East Midlands. VolkerRail were responsible for track installation in both on and off street allowing them to use the embedded rail products of their subsidiary company ALH Rail Coatings. They completed of on street track and of off street track, of many various types, from ballasted track to direct fix track. Also in the project there were multiple crossovers, crossings, and turnouts. The project was completed in 53 weeks and had a value of £10 million. The project was completed in 2004. = Hull Docks = GrantRail reinstating the double junction at Hessle Road, Christmas 2007 The swingbridge built by the Hull and Barnsley Railway to cross the River Hull. Hull Docks has been an ongoing project to upgrade the Hull Docks Branch (Engineers' Line Reference HJS) to treble the lines capacity as the amount of rail traffic through ABP's Hull Docks site increases. The branch is part of the old Hull and Barnsley Railway and was originally built, primarily, for the export of coal via the docks in Hull. Much of the increased rail traffic is, ironically, imported coal. Work also saw many structures along the line upgraded to cater for heavier trains. Included in this part of the project is Hull Bridge, the former Hull and Barnsley swingbridge, known officially as HJS-22. The structure dates from 1885 when the line originally opened. Other work has included multiple earth works and a greatly improved and upgraded signalling system to cope with the increased traffic. The upgraded line was formally opened in June 2008 by the transport minister Rosie Winterton. Work continued on the line after the official opening; the upgraded signalling system began use in September 2008. = Maintenance at Tata Scunthorpe = Locomotive 51 at Scunthorpe steelworks VolkerRail also undertake the Permanment Way maintenance at Tata's Scunthorpe works. This is a very long standing contract and is a legacy of British Steel's ownership of Grant Lyon Eagre and subsequently Corus' part ownership of GrantRail. Work undertaken encompasses all aspects of permanent way work. As well as usual maintenance tasks VolkerRail also undertake renewals and some small scale new build work - larger scale projects are put out to tender although the largest rail project, The Rail Service Centre for handling Continuous Welded Rail trains, was also undertaken VolkerRail (though as GrantRail at the time). As rail is now produced on site Tata supply this for renewals work and it allows rails of 120', rather than the usual 60' lengths, to be used and reduce the number of rail joints. Due to the changing nature of a steel works and the traffic requirements there is a small amount of recovery work for sections which are no longer in use. = Maintenance in Sheffield = VolkerRail have been selected to take part in the maintenance of the Sheffield Supertram network. The work, which is the largest investment programme in the tram system since it began running, involves replacing of the tram track, which was originally laid around 20 years ago and is now experiencing wear. During the project, harder wearing steel will be installed to ensure a longer lifespan, estimated at 25–30 years. Supertram has operated the system since 1997 and has turned it into a successful tram network which is now used by around 15 million people every year.  Joint ventures  VolkerRail's joint ventures include work on the west coast mainline, major involvement in WARM (West Anglia Route Modernization), and the switches and crossing for NET (Nottingham Express Transit). At present VolkerRail are still extending their partnerships and are currently involved in many joint ventures. = London Underground (GTJV) = GTJV was a joint venture between VolkerRail and Trackwork. The joint venture (JV) was awarded a £150 million contract from Tube Lines in 2003 to provide track renewal for of line. This was the largest contract awarded by Tube Lines and a further £55 million was provided for plant, materials, and Tube Lines' management support. Tube Lines were committed to investing a billion pounds into London Underground and this was the first contract. GTJV beat its main rival Jarvis in order to win this contract. Jarvis themselves were a shareholder in Tube Lines Company. A spokeswoman from Tube Lines said there was no pressure to award the contract to one of its own shareholders. \\"The bid process is independent and transparent. GrantRail-Trackwork was chosen because it was the best tender.\\" GTJV will be responsible for replacing or refurbishing of track on the Jubilee line and of track on the Northern and Piccadilly Lines. The replacement of around 50% of the track will make the lines more reliable, faster, and smoother. The project lasted for seven and a half years and ended in 2010. = Docklands Light Rail (DLR) (SGRJV) = VolkerRail is also involved in a joint venture with Skanska known as the Skanska GrantRail Joint Venture (SGRJV). The JV has been awarded the two main construction contracts; Package 8, January 2007, and Package 6, June 2007, of the DLR extension to Stratford International. These two packages are part of the expansion of the DLR for the 2012 Olympic Games. SGRJV was chosen over Hochtief, Carillion and Amec to win the package 8 contract. The £39 million project involves the construction of two platforms on the north bound of Stratford station, the shell and foundations of the new DLR station at Stratford International, and track alignment work for the new rail link. The expansion package should be completed by 2009. Package 6, worth £67 million, will provide the Stratford International extension, which will run to Canning Town and be connected to the Beckton and future Woolwich Arsenal DLR routes. The work will include the conversion of the line between Canning Town and Stratford to Docklands Light Rail Operation, upgrading existing stations to DLR standards, construction of four new stations, and interface with new signalling installation construction. The project was completed in 2010. = M-Pact Thales Consortium = In June 2008 the M-Pact Thales consortium was awarded Greater Manchester's Metrolink phase 3a extension project contract, worth over £350 million. This consortium is composed of VolkerRail, Laing O’Rourke, and Thales. This major expansion scheme will input almost of new Metrolink tram lines with new routes and stops. The consortium is currently carrying out preparatory surveys, exploratory works, and detailed civil engineering for the project. This extension takes five million car journeys off the local roads each year, with the number of tram passengers increasing to more than 90,000 a year. The project was completed in spring 2011.

In 2011 the village had a population of 946. St Adalbert's Church In 1226 Duke Konrad I of Masovia had called for the Teutonic Order to fight against the pagan Old Prussian tribes, and Emperor Frederick II ceded the lands east of the Vistula river to the Knights according to his Golden Bull of Rimini. The Order had a castle (Ordensburg) built at Groß-Rogis —present-day Rogóźno-Zamek— about 1275. Soon after, a parish church was erected near the fortress and a settlement arose. After the Thirteen Years' War 1454–66, the Chełmno region seceded from the State of the Teutonic Order and was incorporated into Chełmno Voivodeship of Royal Prussia, a fief of the Polish Crown. Devastated by Swedish troops in the 17th century, the parish church had to rebuilt twice, using stones from the decayed Order's castle. Rogóźno was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia during the First Partition of Poland in 1772. Part of the West Prussia province, the settlement prospered and by the 19th century was one of the largest villages in the Marienwerder region. Upon the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, the area was ceded to the Second Polish Republic.

Theodora Komnene Kantakouzene (c. 1340 – after 1390) was the Empress consort of Alexios III of Trebizond.  Family  Theodora is considered a daughter of Nikephoros Kantakouzenos, sebastokratōr. According to the history of their kinsman John VI Kantakouzenos, Nikephoros was imprisoned by orders of Alexios Apokaukos, one of the main advisors of Anna of Savoy in the civil war against John VI, in 1341. Nikephoros was later released and recorded as governing Adrianople in the 1350s, having been made sebastokrator. Donald Nicol argues that Nikephoros is a cousin of the Emperor John VI. The identity of Theodora's mother is unknown.  Marriage  When the deposed Emperor of Trebizond Michael was sent, after a period of incarceration, to Constantinople, he was accompanied by the tatas Michael Sampson, who was tasked to find a suitable wife for the new ruler, Alexios III. Donald Nicol presumes that the Byzantine Emperor John VI directed the search, \\"for the wife found was his cousin's daughter.\\" She reached Trebizond on 3 September 1351, and on 28 September, she married Alexios. They were married in the newly rebuilt Hagios Eugenios Church. Her new husband was about a week short of his thirteenth birthday; Theodora is considered likely to have been of an equivalent age.William Miller, Trebizond: The Last Greek Empire of the Byzantine Era, 1926 (Chicago: Argonaut, 1969), p. 55 What we know about her life as empress is mostly based on the chronicle of Michael Panaretos, which is always terse. His chronicle mentions Theodora by name six times, including the record of her marriage and death; she is mentioned twice more by only her title of despoina; and for the notices of the births of the two sons of Alexios, her name is omitted. She accompanied Alexios when he marched on John Tzanitches and quashed his revolt in March 1352; she accompanied both Alexios and his mother Irene when he sailed against the rebel megas Doux Niketas Scholares in 1355; she accompanied both again when they fled an outbreak of the Black Death in Trebizond in March 1362; and she attended the wedding of her daughter Anna with both Alexios and his mother in June 1367.Panaretos, Chronicle, chs. 49, 50, 51, 56, 63, 80. Greek text and English translation in Scott Kennedy, Two Works on Trebizond, Dumbarton Oaks Medieval Library 52 (Cambridge: Harvard University, 2019), pp. 24-31, 36-39 Panaretos' only notice of Theodora which can not be explained as part of her role as wife or Empress is her surprising participation in the funeral procession for the illegitimate son of Alexios, Andronikos, along with her rival, his mother; Andronikos had died under suspicious circumstances after falling from the citadel 14 March 1376.Panaretos, Chronicle, ch. 99. Greek text and English translation in Scott Kennedy, Two Works on Trebizond, pp. 48f Alexios died on 20 March 1390. Theodora survived him, retiring to a monastery in Constantinople. She is likely the nun \\"Theodosia Kantakouzene\\" the Patriarch Matthew I described as \\"the late Empress of the East\\" in a document dated June 1400 concerning money the nun had bequeathed to build a xenon or hospice in the city. They had seven children: * Anna (1357 - after 1406), who married King Bagrat V of Georgia * Basil (September 1358-1377) * Manuel III (1364-1417), Emperor 1390-1416\\\\. Married Gulkhan-Eudokia of Georgia. * Eudokia, who married Tajeddin, Emir of Limnia on 8 October 1379Chalkokondyles states that Eudokia was the second wife of Byzantine Emperor John V Palaiologos, which has been rejected by modern scholars. See * An unnamed daughter, who married Suleyman Beg, Emir of Chalybia, * Another unnamed daughter, who married Mutahharten, Emir of Erzincan * A third unnamed daughter, who married Qara Osman, chieftain of the Aq Qoyunlu Portraits of her and her husband Alexios can be seen on two chrysobulls: one that endows the Dionysiou monastery at Mount Athos, dated September 1374; and one for Soumela Monastery outside of Trebizond, dated December 1364. A portrait of Theodora and Alexios was painted on a wall of the Panagia Khrysokephalos Church in Trebizond, but was destroyed sometime after C. Texier made a drawing of it in the 1860s.

The laws can apply very broadly at a transport system level or more narrowly to transport things or activities within that system such as vehicles, things and behaviours. Transport law is generally found in two main areas: * legislation or statutory law passed or made by elected officials like Parliaments or made by other officials under delegation * case law decided by courts. Legislation typically consists of statutes known as Acts and delegated legislation like regulations, orders or notices. Case law consists of judgments, findings and rulings handed down by courts.  Transport system things and activities  Transport laws can apply at a global transport system-wide level. A transport system can encompass a wide range of matters which make up the system. These include - * heavy and light rail systems including associated land, infrastructure and rolling stock which comprise trains, trams and light rail vehicles * roads including freeways, arterial roads and paths * vehicles including cars, trucks, buses and bicycles * ports and waterways * commercial ships and recreational vessels * air transport systems and aircraft. A transport system includes not only system infrastructure and conveyances, but also things like - * communication systems and other technologies * strategic, business and operational plans * schedules, timetables and ticketing systems * safety systems * labour components * service components * government decision makers like Ministers, departments, authorities, corporations, agencies and other legal persons. The Transport Integration Act of Victoria, Australia provides an example of the use of a broad statutory formulation to circumscribe the operation of a transport law in legislative form.Transport Integration Act 2010 - see www.legislation.vic.gov.au. See the definition of \\"transport system\\" in section 3 of the Act. Individual components can be identified from this broad transport system formulation and then regulated discreetly. For example, a bus or a car forms part of a broad transport system but are commonly regulated on an individual basis in terms of identification (registration), control of the vehicle (driver licensing and drug and blood alcohol controls), vehicle forms and fittings (vehicle standards) and other safety requirements.  Examples of transport legislation  Victoria again provides an example of a jurisdiction with a suite of transport legislation which operates both at transport system and modal or activity levels. = System level = The Transport Integration Act sets out the overall policy framework for transport in Victoria. It also establishes and sets the charters of the key government agencies which make decisions affecting the planning and operation of the State's transport system and each agency is required by the statute to have regard to the policy framework. As a general rule, transport agencies and officials do not exist in their own right and have no existence or power without conferral from a transport law. Legislation is commonly required for this purpose. Transport decision makers and agencies established and/or empowered by the Transport Integration ActTransport Integration Act 2010 - see Parts 3, 5, 5A, 6, and 6A. include - * key government figures such as Ministers (currently the Minister for Public Transport, the Minister for Roads and the Minister for Ports) * a central government Department - the Department of Transport (Victoria, 2019–) - responsible for system-wide planning, integration and coordination * a public transport agency responsible for providing or regulating train, tram, light rail, bus and taxi services - the Public Transport Development Authority * a road agency responsible for road construction and maintenance and vehicles and towing services regulation - the Roads Corporation (VicRoads) * agencies responsible for discrete parts of the rail system such as land, infrastructure and other assets (Victorian Rail Track (VicTrack)) and regional services (V/Line Corporation) * agencies responsible for ports and other waters - the Port of Melbourne Corporation, the Port of Hastings Development Authority, the Victorian Regional Channels Authority and local and other authorities * an independent transport safety regulator (Director, Transport Safety) and independent safety investigator (the Chief Investigator, Transport Safety) The Transport Integration Act establishes these agencies and sets their statutory charters. The charters circumscribe the agencies' jurisdiction or power to operate in and to regulate their respective components of the transport system. = Mode or activity-based legislation = Victoria has a range of statutes which regulate transport modes and transport-related activities throughout the State. These include— * the Road Management Act 2004 * the Road Safety Act 1986 * the Rail Management Act 1996 * the Rail Safety Act 2006 * the Bus Safety Act 2009 * the Bus Services Act 1995 * the Accident Towing Services Act 2007 * the Major Transport Projects Facilitation Act 2009 * the Port Management Act 1995 * the Marine Act 1988 * the Tourist and Heritage Railways Act 2010.  Case law and law from other sources  Areas of transport law governed by court decisions and other non transport statutes or laws include property law, contract law, torts law and specialist regulation governing the contract of carriage, and the relationship between carriers and passengers in public transport and shippers and cargo owners in shipping.

Her father (Law) casts her from his home, and Mary goes to live at Sinclair's mountain lodge. However, Sinclair betrays her and deserts her. The death of her child takes the last bit of ambition from her and she sinks to the lowest depths. Felix, in search of a model to represent the end of the path of sin, rescues her. The appearance of Sinclair and his fiancee Barbara Reynolds (Martin) at the studio brings a desire for revenge to Mary, and she forces Sinclair to establish her in an apartment and supply her with money.

Previously, it was known as the 6th Duke of Connaught's Own Lancers (Watson's Horse), and was a regular cavalry regiment in the British Indian Army. It was formed in 1921 by amalgamation of the 13th Duke of Connaught's Lancers (Watson's Horse) and the 16th Cavalry. The regiment and its predecessors have seen active service on the North West Frontier, in Egypt during 1882, in China during the Boxer Rebellion, the two World Wars and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. On the Partition of India in 1947, the regiment was allotted to the Pakistan Army, where it remains in service today. 13th Duke of Connaught's Lancers (Watson’s Horse) The 13th Duke of Connaught's Lancers was originally raised in Sep 1857, at Lahore, as the 4th Sikh Irregular Cavalry by Lieutenants H Cattley and John Watson VC. Watson was appointed the commandant but did not join until 1860. He would go on to command the regiment for eleven years and is better known for introducing changes in the riding practices of the cavalry, whereby the rider would rise in the stirrups during the trot instead of bumping along in the saddle. The regiment served in the Second Afghan War of 1878–80 and in Egypt in 1882, where it fought against Arabi Pasha at the Battle of Tel-el-Kebir. It so impressed the Duke of Connaught that he requested his mother, Queen Victoria, to appoint him as their Colonel-in- Chief. In 1897, the regiment was engaged in suppressing the tribal uprisings on the Northwest Frontier. During the First World War, the regiment remained on the Northwest Frontier until July 1916, when it moved to Mesopotamia for the relief of Kut-al-Amara. On its return, it served in Waziristan during the Third Afghan War in 1919. *1857 4th Sikh Irregular Cavalry *1861 13th Regiment of Bengal Cavalry *1861 13th Regiment of Bengal Cavalry (Lancers) *1874 13th Regiment of Bengal Lancers *1884 13th (Duke of Connaught's) Regiment of Bengal Lancers *1901 13th (Duke of Connaught's) Bengal Lancers *1903 13th Duke of Connaught's Lancers *1904 13th Duke of Connaught's Own Lancers (Watson's Horse) 13th (Duke of Connaught's) Bengal Lancers scouting. Painting by Harry Paine, 1890. 16th Cavalry The 16th Cavalry was raised as the Rohilcund Horse at Haldwani in 1857 and spent the next two years pacifying the Rohilkhand. In 1864, the regiment was sent to conquer Bhutan as part of the Bhutan Field Force. It was disbanded in 1882 when three regiments were broken up to provide an additional, fourth squadron for the other regiments. However, fears of a Russian invasion led to the approval for an increase in strength of the cavalry and the 16th Cavalry was reformed in 1885 at Ambala. In 1900, the regiment went to China to relieve the international legations in Peking during the Boxer Rebellion. On relieving the American Legation, the 16th Cavalry was presented with the United States flag, which had flown over the building and, for many years, it had hung in the Officers' Mess. During the First World War, the 16th Cavalry served in the Mesopotamian Campaign. After the war, it served in the Third Afghan War of 1919.

However, instead of disbanding the surplus units, it was decided to amalgamate them in pairs. This resulted in renumbering and renaming of the entire cavalry line. The 13th Duke of Connaught's Lancers (Watson's Horse) and 16th Cavalry were amalgamated at Meerut on 1 June 1921 as the 13th/16th Cavalry; becoming the 6th Duke of Connaught's Own Lancers a year later. Their uniform was blue with scarlet facings, while the new badge was to be crossed lances with the figure '6' on the intersection and a scroll below, reading 'The Duke of Connaught's Own'. Their composition was one squadron each of Punjabi Muslims, Sikhs and Dogras. During the Second World War, the 6th Duke of Connaught's Own Lancers, now mounted on armoured cars, served as the Reconnaissance Regiment of 8th Indian Division in the Italian Campaign. The regiment was engaged in a number of actions, most notably the Second Battle of Cassino, Monte Moro, crossing of the Rivers Po and Adige and the race to Venice. In August 1947, on the Partition of India, the 6th DCO Lancers was allotted to Pakistan. The regiment's Jat Squadron went to the 7th Light Cavalry in exchange for their Punjabi Mussalman Squadron, while the Sikh Squadron was exchanged with the Punjabi Mussalmans of the 8th King George V's Own Light Cavalry. The 6th Duke of Connaught's Own Lancers at San Felice, during the advance towards the River Sangro, Italy, 1943 In 1956, Pakistan became a republic and all titles pertaining to the British royalty were dropped. The regiment's new designation was 6 Lancers. During the Indo- Pakistani War of 1965, 6 Lancers spearheaded the Pakistan Army's advance in the Kasur Sector and captured the Indian town of Khem Karan under the dynamic leadership of their Commandant, Lieutenant Colonel Sahib Zad Gul Niazi, who fell in battle while leading his regiment.The Sabre & Lance: Journal of the Pakistan Armoured Corps.

The Big Job shared its cast and production team with the Carry On films, but the film was not officially part of the Carry On series, despite being a typical Carry On format. The film was photographed in black and white, while the Carry On films from the mid 1960s were in colour.The Big Job at IMDb Retrieved 25 January 2014. Plot The story begins in London in 1950. A gang of robbers led by the self-proclaimed George \\"The Great\\" Brain (Sid James) rob a bank, stealing £50,000. They choose a hearse as a getaway vehicle and are pursued and caught by the police. However, before being caught they manage to conceal the money (which is in a briefcase) in the trunk of a hollow tree, before all three are arrested. The gang are sentenced to serve fifteen years in Wormwood Scrubs prison. Upon their release in 1965, the gang go back to the spot where they had left the money, only to find it is now a new town, and a housing estate has been built around the tree. They are dismayed that the tree now lies in the grounds of the local police station - but it is invitingly close to the boundary wall. George and his gang take up rooms in a nearby house rented from a widow and her daughter who also live there. They rent two double rooms on the first floor. In order to provide a respectable front, George reluctantly agrees to marry his longtime girlfriend Myrtle Robbins (Sylvia Syms) who is not so enamoured about the idea of recovering the loot and wants George to settle down with her. The incompetent criminals fail in their numerous attempts to get over or under the wall, all the while trying to conceal their true activities from their landlady (Joan Sims), her daughter (Edina Ronay) and a local police constable (Jim Dale) who also stays there. Eventually, when the men have botched an attempt to tunnel into the grounds, the frustrated women hatch their own plot to gain the money, and succeed, only to find that the money has been shredded by mice nesting in the tree.

History Czyste is a former noble village situated 6 km north of Inowrocław. It was known already in the 15th century, when its owner was the knight Dominik. From the end of the 15th century and for the next 150 years, Modlibogs of the Rola coat of arms had departments in the village. At that time, the village was subordinate to the parish in Liszkowo, and paid tithes there. In the middle of the 17th century, Stanisław Ostrowski, married to Katarzyna Sulikowska, became its owner. At the end of that century, the property of Czyste and Łążyn was owned by Dorota Niemojewska, married to Hieronim Cieński of the Pomian coat of arms, then Andrzej Cieński, who held a number of senior positions, including the Brzesko-Kuyavian table and its successors. At the beginning of the 19th century, Czyste Rafał Mierzyński, of the Jastrzębiec coat of arms, purchased from the Cieński family. He was not a good host, so the poorly managed property was put up for auction. In 1827, the village was purchased by Józef Bauditz. In the same year, he sold the property to Hermann Otto von Krüger from Pławin. In 1844, the Krüger sold Czyste to Ernst Leopold Nehring, who was married to Hermina Kisielnicka, the Topór coat of arms. The estate also included the Łążyn farm. In 1851, Clean for 38 thousand Thalers, were purchased by Juliusz Korneliusz Stubenrauch, and Łążyn for 20.7 thousand Thalers. Around 1856, the owner of Czysty was Juliusz's widow, Leopoldina Reinsdorf; at that time, the present manor house was built in the village. It was built on solid brick foundations of the previous manor house. In 1860, the village was a dominion with the area of 1072 morgen, There were 8 houses with 117 inhabitants (105 Catholics, 9 Evangelicals, 3 Jews, including 63 illiterate people) in the domain. From 1866, Manfred Guradze, married to Sofia Anna Werther, was the owner of the \\"knightly estates\\" of Czyste. In the 1870s, the settlement of Wolanowo, formerly belonging to the Ściborze estate, was included in the estate. In 1909, their total area was 302 ha, and the net income shown for the purpose of calculating the land tax - 5,977 marks. In 1910, Czyste from the Guradz family was purchased by the son of the current tenant, Maks Kohnert - Franz, who 10 years later sold the property for almost 1.3 million marks to January (Janusz) Korytowski of the Mora coat of arms. During the reign of that same, in 1926, the estate covered 302 ha and showed over 2000 thalers of pure land income. In 1929, Czyste was bought from Korytowski by Józef Hoppe of his own coat of arms (1886-1939), married to Janina Bieńkowska of the Ślepowron coat of arms. J. Hoppe was a famous agricultural activist, among others, a graduate of the Higher Agricultural and Veterinary School in Munich, president of the Sugar Beet Growers' Association, decorated with the Polonia Restituta Cross; she - an activist of the Farmers' Circle, powiat Inowrocław.

This holding is the result of a merger between two similar non-profit inspection associations : AIB and Association Vinçotte. History An overview of Vinçotte's history is bound to discourse on the two competing associations that merged in 1989. These two associations were : Association Vinçotte and AIB (Association des Industriels de Belgique). =Association Vinçotte= The logo of AV. In 1872, Maurice Urban, a director of the National Railway Company of Belgium, asked Robert Vinçotte, a young engineer, to help found an organisation to inspect steam boilers in factories. The \\"Association pour la surveillance des chaudières à vapeur\\" was born. Its principal aims were twofold: the inspection of steam boilers to prevent explosions was coupled with an advocacy of a more economic use of power. Its personnel was rather limited: apart from the director, who also did inspection work, only two other engineers were employed. The Association grew rapidly though, because of, among other reasons, the increasing legal pressure on factory owners to make their workplaces safer for their employees. Thus, in 1876, the Association was able to report that it had almost doubled its number of inspection visits in only two years.See \\"Rapport\\", pages 5-7. Said legal pressure resulted mainly in the July 2, 1899 and March 10, 1900 laws on safety and health. Robert Vinçotte was heavily involved in the drafting of these laws as, by then, he had a huge experience in the relatively new area of reliability engineering: not only had he led the Association for more than 25 years, but he had also made an important study visit to the United States in 1881, a trip that resulted in a series of basic mathematical rules for the reliability of steam boilers. Its success allowed the Association in 1887 to offer its employees a life insurance payable upon retirement. Two pages from a handbook for drivers and operators of steam machines, published by the association of engineer alumni of Liège (city). Most of the data in the book, however, was provided by Vinçotte and his Association. In 1905 the Association expanded its inspection domain, due to the advent of electrical devices and installations. Steam boilers would remain its main area of operation for some time to come though: in 1910 it inspected more boilers than the combined inspection organisations of Germany and France, respectively. But the First World War would put a halt to the Association's growth: not only did the latter refuse to inspect German-controlled installations, but a great number of its engineers were drafted into army service. This bleak period did not pass with the end of the war: 1919 and 1920 brought massive inflation and attendant high wage costs. This combined with the death of Robert Vinçotte Jr., son of the founder and the director of the Association at the time. Two years later, the Association would officially become a non-profit organisation, as this concept had just entered Belgian law. The occasion was also used for a name change: the lengthy \\"Association pour la surveillance des chaudières à vapeur\\" was lengthened to \\"Association Vinçotte pour la surveillance des chaudières à vapeur\\" in honour of its first director. Only in 1936 would the implication of only inspecting steam boilers (true in the beginning, but not anymore by 1922) be elided for the short \\"Association Vinçotte\\" (henceforth: AV). In the 1930s, the gradual loss of the focus on steam boiler inspections would continue: not only would AV inspect more and more electrical power plants, but it also sent its engineers to the nascent European airlines. In 1938, AV cooperated with its competitor, the \\"Association des Industriels de Belgique\\" (AIB, cf. below) to perform the first radiographic inspection of weldings.Lecocq, page 18. It was applied to the bridges under construction over the Albert Canal. After inspection, these bridges were shown to be disastrously dangerous for the weight they were supposed to bear. In the same year, AV also experimented with gamma ray inspections, utilizing radium obtained from Union Minière's mines in Katanga.Lecocq, page 21. Similarly to the first one, the Second World War put a temporary stop to AV's activities. Yet business would pick up faster this time, allowing a study trip of Richard Vinçotte, another son of the first director, to the United States, in 1947. In the same year, the new \\"Règlement Général pour la Protection du Travail\\" (\\"General Rules for the Work Protection\\") allowed a broad range of activities for accredited inspection organisations such as AV and AIB. Meanwhile, AV kept on expanding, gaining more and more international prestige. It was this prestige that allowed it to inspect one of the biggest turbo alternators in the world, which was being built in England for the United States in 1969.Verschoren, pages 2-3. 1969 was also a good year because it was then that the nuclear division of AV was founded. Called AV Nucléaire, it would focus on making secure the growing number of nuclear power plants in Belgium and abroad. Innovation would continue in the 70s, when AV started thermographic inspections and nondestructive testing using Foucault currents. Anticipating the problems of the future, it also invested in noise pollution research and set up the first mobile lab in Belgium to investigate air quality through samples. In 1973, looking backward on the occasion its 100th anniversary, AV could proudly announce that none of the steam boilers that exploded in Belgium had been under its regular inspection. As with so many companies of the era, the 80s brought financial hardship and cutbacks. This finally led to a merger with its competitor AIB, making the new \\"AIB-Vinçotte\\" the biggest player at inspection and certification on the Belgian market. Both companies had already closely cooperated in Controlatom, and of course shared a great deal of heritage, all the way back to their roots. =AIB (Association des Industriels de Belgique)= The logo of AIB. In 1890, 13 engineers, captains of industry, and representatives of parliament gathered to found the \\"Association des Industriels de Belgique pour l'étude et la propagation des engins et mesures propres à préserver les ouvriers des accidents du travail\\"Translation: \\"Association of Belgian Industrials for the Study and Propagation of machines and proper measures to protect workers from accidents\\". (usually shortened to AIB). This happened under the impulse of Henri Adan, the director of the Royale Belge, a Belgian insurance company. In the speech he gave on the first meeting of the board, Adan strongly expressed his faith in private initiative instead of state interference: The speech Henri Adan gave on the first board meeting of AIB. > Comme le disait M. Westerroiien van Mesteren, le promoteur de l'Association > Néerlandaise pour prévenir les accidents dans les fabriques et chantiers, il > est de la plus haute importance pour un petit pays de se joindre au > mouvement international qui permet à l'initiative privée de l'industriel, de > faire le bien sans qu'une loi coercitive lui prescrive ce devoir et le rende > odieux. Cette appréciation trouvait particulièrement application en notre > pays; il était impossible que nos traditions de liberté nous permissent > d'hésiter entre un régime coercitif et les enseignements d'un régime > libre.Quoted in de Brouwer, pages 8-9. Translation: \\"As M. Westerroiien van > Mesteren, the promoter of the Dutch Association for the prevention of > accidents in factories and construction sites, said, it is of the highest > importance for a small country [=Belgium and The Netherlands] to join with > an international movement that allows the private initiative of the > entrepreneur to do good without coercive laws prescribing him what to do and > thus rendering those good deeds hateful\\". Of course, as described in the previous section of this article, the Belgian state would introduce legislation concerning the safety of the workplace only ten years later, slightly undermining the pure laissez-faire philosophy enunciated here. Thus, later presidents of the Association such as Yvon Verwilst would rather claim (in 1940) that AIB is \\"le corollaire de celle de pouvoirs publics et qu'elle se considérait comme l'auxiliaire de ceux- ci\\"Verwilst, page 15. Trans.: \\"...the corollary of the government and that it considers itself as the auxiliary of it\\". This switch in rhetoric between claiming to anticipate the state and merely serving it as a supplement, is a constant in AIB's speeches up to 1940. The structure of the newborn Association was to be non-profit: members would pay fees and get regular inspections and safety education by engineers of AIB. From the beginning, AIB had a general focus on security and education. Thus, it did not hesitate to create new divisions. Already in 1894, president M. Jottrand declared that henceforth AIB would start inspecting chains, whose breakage was causing heavy accidents in the mining and construction business.Quoted in Verwilst, page 14 Fame came quickly for AIB, in Belgium and abroad: there was the admired exposition in Brussels of machine parts and how they might fail, and in Paris the Association received a gold medal for two expositions (in 1900 and 1904). In 1910, AIB exposed in Brussels, Liège, Milan and St. Louis. After the First World War, AIB's personnel remained constant, and hirings started soaring after 1931, showing the solid expansion of the Association in that period. The surplus in money was invested in a unique machine, one that could exert a test power of 800 tons on cables and chains. At the time (1938), there was no other like it in the world.Verwilst, page 21 In the 50s, AIB would focus on organising international congresses: in 1955 the First International Congress on Nondestructive Testing and in 1958 the Second International Congress for the Prevention of Work Accidents. Finally, in 1989, it merged with its major competitor in Belgium, the Association Vinçotte, making the combined \\"AIB- Vinçotte\\" the biggest player on the Belgian market. =After the merger= In the 1990s, AIB-Vinçotte stabilized itself financially, and adopted a holding structure. In 2004, it shortened its name to just \\"Vinçotte\\" and opened offices in 14 countries. In 2017 it was decided to focus on the 3 main countries: Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxemburg. ITER Project In 2008, ITER has decided to ask Vinçotte who is accredited by the French Nuclear Authorities ASN to assess the confinement vessel, heart of the project, following the French Nuclear Regulatory requirements.

Educated at Nelson College from 1930 to 1933,Nelson College Old Boys' Register, 1856–2006, 6th edition (CD-ROM). he was a newspaper copyholder and junior reporter on Wellington's Evening Post newspaper from 1934. Zohrab graduated from Victoria University of Wellington with a master's degree in History in 1937 and became an assistant librarian at Parliament’s General Assembly Library. Apart from his native English, he knew French, Italian, German, some Japanese, some Malay, and taught himself Russian. In World War II, he was a cipher clerk on General Freyberg’s staff, where his duties included interviewing Italian prisoners of war. He spent time recuperating from illness in Lebanon, then was invalided home from the Middle East. In 1944, he was appointed to the Ministry of Rehabilitation, then to the Prime Minister’s Department, in the section that became what is now known as the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. He served in London, Moscow, Paris, then in Wellington and, overseas again, in Tokyo. He was the first Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva 1961–64, worked at Wellington headquarters, then was made High Commissioner to Malaysia 1967–69, then Ambassador to Germany 1969–74 accredited also to Austria, Switzerland and Poland. He retired in 1974, after 26 years of service overseas. He was born in Wellington of a part-Armenian family whose paternal ancestor was moved from Armenia to Persia by the Shah in around 1600 AD. Members of the family became influential in Persia and were forced to escape political assassination at the end of the 18th century by fleeing to Turkey. In due course, some family members moved, in turn, to Malta, England, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. He was an amateur pianist who reportedly played on Radio New Zealand in his youth, and he was interested in the arts generally. His other hobbies were reading, contract bridge and gardening. He married Rosemary Alice Miller in 1947; and died in Waikanae, leaving two sons.

Early life There are few records of Featon's early life. She was of English origin, born to Henry William Porter in 1848. It is unclear when she arrived in New Zealand but she is recorded as having married Edward Featon at St Paul's, Auckland in 1870. In 1875 Featon and her husband moved to Gisborne, as Edward had been appointed as the area's first District Land Officer. Published work During this time Featon and her husband began work on their seminal work The Art Album of New Zealand Flora. Featon painted the watercolours for the plates while her husband wrote the text. The Featons set out to produce their album to debunk the widely held belief that there were no flowers in New Zealand. The album was the first full-colour art book to be published in New Zealand. It contained systematic and popular descriptions of the native flowering plants of New Zealand and the adjacent islands. Featon created all of the artwork for the book and commissioned the chromolithography for the book plates from the workshop of Bock and Cousins, Wellington. The album was originally published in three parts, the first part being released in November 1887 and the next two in 1888. The three parts were issued as a single volume in 1889. A copy of the book was presented by the New Zealand Government to Queen Victoria in 1897 on the occasion of her diamond jubilee. That copy is now in the British Museum. Reverend William Colenso, a prominent early settler and noted expert on botany, and Archdeacon (later Bishop) W. L . Williams were keen supporters of the book and supplied specimens to Featon to paint. Colenso named a newly discovered species, Dracophyllum featonium, in her honour. This species is now regarded as being synonymous with Dracophyllum strictum. Later life Featon suffered financial hardship later in life and sold the original artwork for the book to the Dominion Museum - now the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa where they continue to be held. She died in Gisborne on 28 April 1927, and was buried at Makaraka Cemetery.

He previously served as the executive chairman of Towergate Partnership until April 2015. Early life Peter Geoffrey Cullum was born in September 1950 in Norwich, Norfolk, England. In his youth, Cullum played for the Norwich City boys team and was a regular spectator at Carrow Road from the 1950s. Career Cullum began his insurance career in 1969 with the Royal Insurance Group and progressed to sales and marketing positions within Commercial Union and ITT London and Edinburgh where he became marketing director in 1988. At the age of 21, he became the youngest person to pass the Chartered Insurance Institute fellowship examinations. In 1991, Cullum joined Economic Insurance and led their return to profitability in 1993. In December 1993, he led the management buyout of Economic Insurance that was sold in 1995 to Hiscox plc. He joined Hiscox as group marketing director, a role he held until he left in 1997 to create Towergate Underwriting Group. By 2010, his personal fortune was reportedly worth £1.7bn. =Norwich City F.C.= In 2008, Cullum offered Norwich City F.C. £20m, in return for becoming the majority shareholder. In November 2008, Cullum stated his determination not to \\"\\"just stand by as a spectator\\" if Norwich City was on the financial brink.\\" He also expressed his admiration for what Delia Smith and Michael Wynn-Jones have achieved at the club: > \\"the two of them have been brilliant for Norwich City - and I've always said > that. Every home and away game they are there. They've put a lot of their > own personal wealth into this.

He was active in Yorkshire. He was arrested in bed very early on Palm Sunday, 1595, at the house of Thomas Watkinson, at Menthorpe in East Yorkshire. Someone had seen palms being gathered the night before, and informed John Gates of Howden, the nearest justice of the peace. Watkinson, an old Catholic yeoman who lived a solitary life, is described by John Cecil as a clerk, so it is possible he was in minor orders. Thorpe was condemned as a traitor for being a Catholic priest, and was hanged, drawn, and quartered at York. Watkinson, condemned as a felon for harbouring priests, was hanged, despite having been offered his life if he would go to church.

These waxcaps are found across the Northern Hemisphere from China and Japan to Europe and North America. The small bright red mushroom is a familiar sight in unimproved grasslands in Europe in late summer and autumn, and woodlands in North America in winter. Taxonomy The scarlet hood was first described as Agaricus coccineus by German mycologist Jacob Christian Schäffer in 1774, before being transferred to the genus Hygrophorus by Elias Magnus Fries in 1838, and finally Hygrocybe by Paul Kummer in 1871. The specific epithet coccinea is Latin for \\"scarlet\\". Description A small waxcap with an initially bell-shaped, and later flattening, cap 2–5 cm (¾–2 in) across, scarlet in colour and slimy in texture. The adnate gills are thick and widely spaced, yellow red in colour. The spore print is white. The ringless stipe is up 2–5 cm (¾-2 in) high and 0.3–1 cm (⅛-⅓ in) wide, red with a yellowish base. The flesh is yellowish-red and the smell and taste faint. The oval spores measure 7–9.5 x 4–5 μm. Distribution and habitat Hygrocybe coccinea has a wide distribution in unimproved grasslands across Europe from August to October. In Britain, like all Hygrocybes, it has its best seasons in frost- free late autumn months, and in western North America it may be found under redwoods or in mixed woodland in winter. It has been recorded growing under Rhododendron and oak (Quercus) in Sagarmatha National Park in Nepal, and also occurs in India, China and Japan. Specimens initially identified as H. coccinea in Australia have been reclassified as H. miniata or H. kandora. Edibility The scarlet hood is edible, but of fairly little interest.

Darcy was opposed to the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and for his role in the Pilgrimage of Grace was convicted of high treason for delivering up Pontefract Castle to the rebels. He was executed on Tower Hill 30 June 1537. Family The Darcy family had held lands in Lincolnshire since the Domesday survey, wherein it appears that one Norman de Areci held thirty lordships in that county by the Conqueror's gift. A little later the name became d'Arci, later d'Arcy and finally Darcy. In the reign of Edward III they acquired by marriage other possessions in various counties, among which was the family seat of Templehurst (or Temple Hurst), near Selby in Yorkshire. Sir William Darcy died on 30 May 1488, leaving his only son and heir Thomas who was over twenty-one years of age. Marriage and issue He married as his first wife Dousabella Tempest (died before 1500), daughter and heiress of Sir Richard Tempest of Ribblesdale, North Yorkshire and Mabel, daughter of Walter Strickland. They had three sons and a daughter: * George Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy of Aston (died 28 Aug 1558) married Dorothy Melton (died 21 Sep 1557), daughter of John Melton of Aston and Katherine, daughter of Hugh Hastings. He was knighted 9 September 1513 at Flodden.J. Mackie, 'The English Army at Flodden', Miscellany of the Scottish History Society, VIII (Edinburgh 1951), p.79 * Richard Darcy * Sir Arthur Darcy (died 3 Apr 1561) married Mary Carew, daughter of Sir Nicolas Carew. He was knighted in 1523. * Mabel Darcy A letter signed \\"D. Darcy\\", believed to have been written by Dousabella to her husband in January 1537, appears actually to have been written by Dorothy, the wife of George Darcy. In or before 1500 he married Edith Sandys (died 22 August 1529), daughter of Sir William Sandys and Margaret Cheyne and widow of Ralph, Lord Neville (died 1498), son of Ralph Neville, 3rd Earl of Westmorland. They had a daughter: * Elizabeth Darcy (c. 1501 – ) married 26 Apr 1514 Sir Marmaduke Constable (c.1498 – 20 Apr 1560) Through this marriage, Darcy became stepfather to Ralph Neville, 4th Earl of Westmorland. His wife died at Stepney on 22 August 1529, and was buried at the Friars Observant, Greenwich. Career It is evident that Darcy's early career chiefly involved his military abilities and he had distinguished himself in the reign of Henry VII. Some of the honours he achieved and the offices that he held included: * Knighthood 1489 * Knight Banneret 1497 * Constable of Bamburgh Castle 1498 * Captain of Berwick 1498-1515 * Treasurer of Berwick 1501 * Warden of the East Marches 1505 * Knight of the Garter 1509 * Warden of the Royal Forests, North of Trent 1509 * Baron Darcy (of Darcy or of Temple Hurst) by writ, 1509 * Warden of the East and Middle Marches 1511 * Privy Councillor 1513 =Political advancement= In 1492 Darcy was bound by indenture to serve Henry VII beyond sea for a whole year with one thousand men, \\"himself having his costrel and page, 16 archers, and 4 bills, and 6 H.\\" (apparently halberds) on foot. In the latter part of the same year he attended the king at the reception of the French embassy sent to treat for peace. In 1496 he was indicted at quarter sessions in the West Riding for giving to various persons a token or livery called the Buck's Head. But next year he marched with Surrey to raise the siege of Norham Castle, and pursued King James on his retreat into Scotland. He was a knight for the king's body, and is so designated in the patent by which, on 8 June 1498, he was made constable and doorward of Bamburgh Castle in Northumberland. On 16 December of the same year he, being then captain of Berwick, was appointed deputy to Henry, Duke of York (then only 7 years old) who was warden of the east and middle marches. While thus engaged on the borders he had a good deal of correspondence with Henry's able minister Fox, Bishop of Durham, whose bishopric lay continually open to invasion. In the same year, 1498, he was one of three commissioners appointed to assess fines on those who had taken part in the revolt on behalf of Perkin Warbeck in the previous year in Devon and Cornwall. He was also one of three appointed for a like purpose (but apparently two years later) for the counties of Somerset, Dorset, Wiltshire, and Hampshire, and he himself had a special commission to execute the offices of constable and marshal of England on those who refused to compound. On 6 July 1499 he was appointed one of five ambassadors to settle disputes with Scotland. Besides being captain of Berwick, he was on 10 September 1501 appointed treasurer and chamberlain of that town, and customer of the port there. In the latter part of the year 1502 he and Henry Babington were despatched into Scotland to receive the oath of James IV to a treaty of peace, which they accordingly did at Glasgow on 10 December. Shortly before this, in 1499/1500, he was appointed by the crown as constable and steward of Sheriff Hutton; and afterwards, on 12 July 1503, as receiver-general of the lordships, castles, and manors of Sheriff Hutton, Middleham, and Richmond in Yorkshire. On 8 June 1505 we first find him named Lord Darcy in a patent by which he was made steward of the lands of Raby and other possessions of the young Earl of Westmorland, then a minor. These offices, together with his new peerage, must have given him an influence in the north of England second only to that of the Earl of Northumberland, when on 1 September 1505 he was appointed warden of the east marches, a higher office in dignity than he had yet held, though he had discharged its duties before as deputy to another. In 1508 he was one of fifteen lords bound by the treaty for the marriage of the king's daughter Mary with Charles of Castile (afterwards the Emperor Charles V) that that marriage should be completed when the bride came to marriageable age. He was also one of the witnesses of the celebration of the match by proxy at Richmond on 17 December following. Just after the accession of Henry VIII in the following spring he was made a knight of the Garter. He was installed on 21 May. Some changes were then made in his appointments and he gave up the constableship and stewardship of Sheriff Hutton, which were given to Sir Richard Cholmeley in his place. But most of the others were renewed, especially his commission as warden of the east marches and captain of Berwick. For these and a number of other offices new patents were granted to him on 18 June 1509, on which day he was also appointed warden, chief justice, and Justice in Eyre of forests beyond Trent. He was also named to the king's council, and when in London he took part in its deliberations, and signed warrants as a privy councillor. His name stood first in the commission of array for Northumberland; and when the bridge at Newcastle upon Tyne had to be repaired it was to be done under the supervision of Darcy and the prior of Durham. On 17 October 1509, Darcy was summoned to parliament and was created Baron Darcy de Darcy. The same year he also was invested as Knight of the Order of the Garter (KG). =Foreign expeditions= In 1511 Darcy was sent to Spain at his own request to aid Ferdinand in his war against the Moors, the Spanish king having solicited the aid of fifteen hundred English archers. On 8 March, or rather apparently on the 28th, he received his commission from Henry VIII to serve as Ferdinand's admiral, and on the 29th Lord Willoughby de Broke and others were commissioned to muster men for him. The expedition sailed from Plymouth in May and arrived at Cadiz on 1 June. But no sooner had the troops landed than misunderstandings arose between them and the natives, and Ferdinand politely intimated that their services would not be required, as he had made a truce with the Moors in expectation of a war with France. Darcy, much disgusted, re-embarked on 17 June and returned home. On 3 August he had only reached Cape St. Vincent, where he was obliged to give out of his own money £20 to each of his captains for the victualling of his men; but apparently this was repaid a year after his return home by the Spanish ambassador, who in a letter of Wolsey's dated 30 September is said to have 'dealt liberally with Lord Darcy in the matter of his soldiers'. Soon after his return, on 20 October 1511, he was appointed warden both of the east and middle marches against Scotland, which office, however, he resigned in or before December, when Lord Dacre was appointed warden in his place. In 1512 and 1513 he wrote to the king and Wolsey important information of what was happening in Scotland and upon the borders. In the summer of 1513 he accompanied the king in the invasion of France, and was at the siege of Thérouanne. In January following he writes from his own house at Templehurst an interesting letter to Wolsey, in which he speaks of having recovered from recent sickness, says that his expeditions to Spain and France had cost him £4,000 in three years and a half, but declares his willingness to serve the king beyond sea in the following summer. He reminds Wolsey (whose growing influence at this time was marked by everyone) how they had been bedfellows at court and had freely spoken to each other about their own private affairs, and how Wolsey when abroad with the king in the preceding year regretted that Darcy had not been appointed marshal of the army at the beginning of the campaign. =Further public service= In 1514/5 his son and heir apparent, Sir George Darcy, was included with him in some of the appointments he then held. In 1515 he gave up the captaincy of Berwick, and was succeeded by Sir Anthony Ughtred. He appears to have attended parliament in that year, and to have been present in London at the reception of Wolsey's cardinal's hat in November. In May 1516 he witnessed a decree in the Star Chamber. A year later he received Henry VIII's sister Margaret, the widow of James IV, at her entry into Yorkshire on her return to Scotland. In July 1518 he was one of those who met Cardinal Campeggio on his first mission to England, two miles out of London. A year later, a privy search having been ordered to be made throughout London and the neighbourhood for suspicious characters, Darcy and Sir John Nevill were appointed to conduct it in Stepney and the eastern suburbs. In 1519 he attended the feast of St. George on 28 and 29 May. In March 1520 he resigned his offices in Sheriff Hutton to his friend, Sir Robert Constable, whom he familiarly called his brother, in whose favour a new patent was granted by the king. His name occurs shortly afterwards in various lists of persons to accompany the king to the Field of the Cloth of Gold; but it is more than doubtful whether he went there, seeing that on 29 June, just after the interview, he and Lord Berners waited on three French gentlemen and conducted them to see the princess at Richmond, though their arrival the day before was only notified a few hours in advance by letters from Wolsey, who was still at Guisnes. In 1523 he took an active part in the war against Scotland, making various raids on the borders with a retinue of 1,750 men. In the same year he obtained a principal share in the wardship of the son and heir of Lord Monteagle, which led to many complaints from one of the executors named Richard Bank. On 12 February 1525 he was again appointed to conduct a privy search at Stepney. The annual revenue of his lands in various counties is given in a contemporary document as £1,834 4s., and he was taxed for the first and second payment of the subsidy at no less than £1,050. =Wolsey’s downfall= In 1529 Darcy prepared the way for his old comrade Wolsey's fall by drawing up a long paper of accusations against him, in which he professed that his motive was \\"only for to discharge my oath and most bounden duty to God and the king, and of no malice\\". In the same year he was one of the many witnesses examined on the king's behalf as to the circumstances of Prince Arthur's marriage with Catherine of Aragon, though he had limited evidence to give upon the subject, having been at that time in the king's service in the north of England. He was one of the peers who signed the articles prepared against Wolsey in parliament on 1 December, partly founded on the charges drawn up by himself five months before; and in the following year he signed the memorial of the lords spiritual and temporal of England to Pope Clement VII, warning him of the danger of not gratifying the desire of Henry VIII in the matter of the divorce. =Opposition to the king= It was not long, however, before Darcy became a rather marked opponent of the court in reference to this very subject. In the parliament which met in January 1532 the Duke of Norfolk made a speech, declaring how ill-treated the king had been by the pope not remitting the cause to be tried in England, adding that it was maintained by some that matrimonial causes were a matter of temporal jurisdiction, of which the king was the head and not the pope, and finally asking whether they would not employ their persons and goods in defence of the royal prerogative against interference from abroad. To this appeal Darcy was the first to reply. He said his person and goods were at the king's disposal, but as to matrimonial causes he had always understood that they were spiritual and belonged to ecclesiastical jurisdiction; and if the question presented any difficulties it was for the king's council first to say what should be done without involving others in their responsibility. After this it is not surprising to learn that among other peers who were treated in a similar manner he was informed that his presence in the January session of 1534 would be dispensed with, although he had received a regular summons to attend. Among matters of minor interest about this period we find him reminding Bishop Tunstall after his promotion to Durham of a promise of the offices of steward and sheriff of his bishopric. A long-standing dispute with his neighbours at Rothwell in Yorkshire comes to light in a commission obtained in April 1533 to examine certain of the inhabitants who had threatened, in defiance of a decree of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, to pull down the gates and hedges of Rothwell park. In July 1534 he was one of the jury of peers who acquitted Lord Dacre, an act which did little to make him more acceptable to the court. Thomas Cromwell, however, appears to have been his friend (although at the end of his life Darcy showed his deep hatred of and contempt for Cromwell) and obtained for his second son, Sir Arthur Darcy, the office of captain or governor of Jersey in September following, for whose appointment he wrote Cromwell a letter of thanks from Mortlake, regretting that he was unable to visit him personally, owing to his \\"fulsum diseassis.\\" It appears that he was suffering from a rupture. He at the same time sent Sir Arthur with messages both to Cromwell and to the Duke of Norfolk, among other things complaining that he had not been allowed to go home into Yorkshire since the parliament began. And this must mean since November 1529 when the still existing parliament began, not since the beginning of a session, for it was then vacation time. A significant part of the instructions to Sir Arthur as regards the Duke of Norfolk was to deliver a letter to him \\"for no goodness in him but to stop his evil tongue.\\" Rebel In the same month in which his son was appointed captain of Jersey, Darcy began to hold secret communications with Eustace Chapuys, the imperial ambassador, along with Lord Hussey, whom he called his brother, to invite the emperor to invade England and put an end to what he described as a tyranny in matters secular and religious, which the nation endured only because there was no deliverer. His earnest application for leave to go home was with a view to aid the invaders when this scheme should be set on foot, and he actually succeeded in obtaining a licence to absent himself from future feasts of St. George on account of his age and debility. On the same day (28 October) he also obtained a licence of absence from future meetings of parliament and exemption from serving on any commission; but the latter did not pass the great seal till 12 February following. For these important privileges he writes to thank Cromwell on 13 November, dating his letter from Templehurst, where, however, he could hardly have been at that time, as Chapuys expressly says on 1 January 1535 that he had not yet been allowed to retire to his own country. The hope of soon going home to Templehurst seems to have influenced his pen to write as if he were actually there when he really was in or about London. The fact is that, although these exemptions were conceded to him on the ground of age and infirmity, permission to go back to his home in Yorkshire was still persistently withheld. The court apparently suspected that his presence in the north would do them little good, and he remained not only till the beginning of 1535, but through most part of the year, if not the whole of it. He kept up secret communications with Chapuys at intervals in January, March, May, and July, hoping now and again that matters were ripe for a great revolt, and sending the ambassador symbolic presents when he dared not express his meaning otherwise. In the beginning of May he was hopeful at last of being allowed to go home immediately. But in the middle of the month, this hope having apparently disappeared, he was thinking how to escape abroad and endeavour to impress upon the emperor in a personal interview the urgent necessity of sending an expedition against England to redeem the country from what he described as the heresy, oppression, and robbery to which it was constantly subjected. How long he was detained in London we do not know, but it was certainly till after July. He appears to have been at Templehurst in April 1536; but there is a blank in our information as to the whole preceding interval. His presence not being required in the parliamentary session of February 1536, he escaped the pressure which was doubtless brought to bear upon others to vote for the dissolution of the smaller monasteries, a measure which was very unpopular in the north of England, whatever it might be elsewhere. This, indeed, was one of the chief causes of that great rebellion which, beginning in Lincolnshire in October following, soon spread to Yorkshire, and was called the Pilgrimage of Grace. Reconstruction of Pontefract Castle Almost the only place which seemed for a time to hold out against the insurgents was Pontefract Castle, of which Darcy held the command. Thither fled Archbishop Lee of York, who put himself under Darcy's protection with some of the neighbouring gentry. But Darcy, pretending that his provisions had run short, yielded up the castle to the rebels, who compelled him and the archbishop to be sworn to the common cause. The compulsion, however, was more ostensible than real. Darcy, the archbishop, and nearly all the gentry really sympathised with the insurgents, and it was in vain that Darcy afterwards pleaded that he was doing his utmost for the king by endeavouring to guide aright a power that he could not resist. He stood by Robert Aske, the leader of the commons, when Lancaster Herald knelt before him, and he negotiated in their favour with the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk when they were sent down to suppress the rising. His position as a friend and leader of the insurgents was recognised by the king himself, who instructed Norfolk and Fitzwilliam to treat with him as such, and authorised them to give him and the others a safe-conduct if necessary, to come to his presence, or else to offer them a free pardon on their submission. Norfolk, presumably at the King's desire, wrote to Darcy suggesting that he could redeem himself by breaking his word to Aske and arresting him. Darcy, who prided himself on being true to his sworn word, replied indignantly: \\"Alas my good lord that ever you a man of so much honour and great experience should advise or choose me to ....betray or disserve any living man.\\" Both he and Aske wrote to the king to set their conduct in a more favourable light. A meeting with some of the king's council was arranged at Doncaster, and the king sent a pardon even to the chief offenders. But on 6 January following (1537) Henry sent him an imperative summons to come up to London in reply to which he wrote from Templehurst on the 14th, stating that he had 'never fainted nor feigned' in the service of the king and his father within the realm or abroad for about fifty years; but since the meeting at Doncaster he had been confined to his chamber with two diseases, rupture and flux, as several of the council who saw him at Doncaster and the king's own physicians could bear witness. The country was at that moment in a very dangerous state, a new rebellion having been just begun by Sir Francis Bigod, which Aske and Darcy did their best to stay. Their services were so real that the king pardoned both of them, and encouraged Darcy to victual Pontefract, that his two sons, Sir George and Sir Arthur, might keep it in case of a new rising. Darcy was further assured, by letters addressed to the Earl of Shrewsbury, that if he would do his duty thenceforward it would be as favourably considered as if he had never done amiss. Encouraged by this he wrote to Aske on 10 February, asking him to redeliver secretly to Pontefract Castle (for the custody of which Darcy was responsible) all the bows and arrows that he had obtained out of it. The letter unluckily was intercepted, and it told a tale. Information was collected to show that since his pardon Darcy had been guilty of different acts of treason, among which his intimating to the people that there would be a free parliament to consider their grievances was cited in evidence that he was still seeking to promote a change, and that if there were no parliament the rebellious spirit would revive with his approval. Even his recent acts in the king's behalf were construed to his disadvantage; for having given orders to stay the commons till Norfolk came, the words were taken to imply that he only wished them pacified for a season. Arrest, trial and execution Darcy was apprehended, brought up to London, and lodged in the Tower of London, as were several other of the northern leaders at the same time. Examined by the Privy Council, Darcy used the occasion to make clear his hatred and contempt for Thomas Cromwell: \\"thou that art the very original and chief causer of this rebellion and mischief and likewise art the cause of apprehension to us that be noblemen and dost earnestly travail to bring us to our end and strike off our heads.\\" He warned Cromwell, prophetically, that he must not count on the King's favour towards him lasting, for : \\"others that have been in such favour with Kings that you now enjoy have come to the same end you bring me to\\" and expressed his hope that even if Cromwell struck off every nobleman's head, \\"yet one (i.e. the King) shall remain that shall strike off yours\\". Sign at the Tower Hill scaffold location An indictment found against Darcy and the other northern leaders on 9 May at York says that they had conspired together in October, first to deprive the king of his royal dignity by disowning his title of Supreme Head of the Church of England, and secondly to compel him to hold a parliament; that they had afterwards committed diverse acts of rebellion; that after being pardoned they had corresponded with each other, and that Darcy and others had abetted Bigod's rebellion in January. On these charges he and his old friend, John Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford were arraigned at Westminster on 15 May before the Marquess of Exeter as Lord High Steward, and a number of their peers. They were condemned to suffer the extreme penalty for treason, but the punishment actually inflicted upon them was decapitation, which Lord Hussey underwent at Lincoln, where he was conveyed on purpose to strike terror where the insurrection had begun. But Darcy was beheaded on Tower Hill on 30 June. His head was set up on London Bridge, and his body, according to one contemporary writer, was buried at Crutched Friars. But if so, it must have been removed afterwards; at least, if a tombstone inscription may be trusted, it lies with the bodies of other Darcys in the church of St Botolph's Aldgate. Following his arrest and conviction in 1537, his lands and property were seized, and in 1539 he was posthumously attainted, the barony was forfeited and his knighthood degraded. During the reign of Edward VI, his eldest son, Sir George Darcy, was restored in blood, by an Act of Parliament, in 1548, to the dignity of Baron Darcy. Some sources state, however, that this was a new creation, rather than a restoration of his father's forfeited barony. It is remarkable that the new Baron Darcy took his place in the House of Lords as the junior baron and not in the 1509 precedence of the former Barony, whereas, his son took his seat in the House of Lords in the precedence of the former barony, which assumption seems to have been condoned by the House. Although he never regained any of his father's lands, the title of Lord Darcy of Aston descended to his heirs male until it became extinct for lack of issue in 1635.

The instrument has been used to study the galaxy, asteroids and comets. It was last dedicated to the Siding Spring Survey. The telescope had a field of view of just over 6° through the use of a correcting plate, making its field three times as large as that of the Anglo- Australian Telescope. It used a spherical rather than a parabolic mirror with 0.6 m correcting plate to achieve this. Photographic plates and film were used as detectors. History The Uppsala Schmidt Telescope was built in 1956 in Sweden. The telescope was originally located at the Mount Stromlo Observatory. It was operational there between 1957 and 1982. It took the first images ever recorded of the Sputnik satellite in 1957. The telescope was modernised in 2000 and 2001 to include the experimental use of Charge-coupled devices (CCDs) which are 40 times more sensitive than standard photography. The Uppsala Schmidt telescope was the instrument used by the Siding Spring Survey to conduct the only professional search for dangerous asteroids being made in the Southern Hemisphere. The telescope was decommissioned by the ANU late in 2013 and the Siding Spring Survey near-Earth object search program closed down after funding dried up. Discoveries The telescope was used by Robert H. McNaught to discover 400 potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroids which have a diameter greater than . McNaught used the telescope to discover comet C/2006 P1, also known as the Great Daylight Comet of 2007, on the night of 7 August 2006. That comet was the brightest seen in over 40 years. Other notable discoveries made by the telescope include finding 7604 Kridsadaporn, C/2007 Q3, C/2009 R1, C/2013 A1 (\\"Siding Spring Comet\\"), 2012 LZ1, (242450) 2004 QY2 and (308242) 2005 GO21.

Płonkowo was mentioned as \\"Płomykowa\\" in a letter written in 1297 by Jarosław, Castellan of Słonsk, and in another letter written about 1304 by Jan, voivode of Brzesc-Kujawy. Jan of Płonkowo, sometime Castellan of Wyszogród, witnessed a document dated October 12, 1314. About 1580, Jedrzej Kaczkowski owned the village. In 1638, Kasper Działynski, Bishop of Chełm, donated the village to the Jesuits in Bydgoszcz. The parish included: Dobiesławice, Glinno, Kaczkowo, Mierogonowice, Płonkowko, Rojewo, Sciborze, Topola, and Wierzchosławice.

In 1873 the parish numbered 1163 souls.Słownik Geograficzny Krolestwa Polskiego, vol. VIII (Warsaw: 1887), p. 311. Płonkowo belonged to the manor of Kaczkowo. In 1663, Stanisław Tuczyński sold Kaczkowo, Skalmierowice, Mierogonowice, Jędrzejewo, Glinno, and Olęndry to Tomasz Przetocki. In 1670, Przetocki sold the manor to Bishop Stanisław Dąmbski (ca. 1638–1700). At his death, the manor included Płonkowo and seven other villages. The bishop's brother, Zygmunt Dąmbski, Count of Lubraniec, inherited the manor.Jarosław Dumanowski, Hrabiowie na Lubrancu: dzieje fortuny magnackiej (Toruń: Wydawnictwo Adam Marszałek, 2000), pp. 77, 86 The manor then passed to Zygmunt's son, Wojciech Dąmbski, in 1706, and on to Wojciech's son, Antoni Dąmbski, in 1725. Antoni sold the manor to his brother-in-law (and third cousin) Kazimierz Dąmbski, in 1741.Seweryn Uruski, Rodzina, Herbarz Szlachty Polskie, vol. III (Warsaw, Poland: Skład Głowny Księgarnia Gebethnera i Wolffa, 1906), pp. 102, 109 Kazimierz's son, Jan Chrziciel Dąmbski, Count of Lubraniec, inherited the manor in 1765. He was living at Kaczkowo in 1812, when foreign troops from Württemberg destroyed the palace.Seweryn Uruski, Rodzina, Herbarz Szlachty Polskie, vol. III (Warsaw, Poland: Skład Głowny Księgarnia Gebethnera i Wolffa, 1906), p. 110 In 1831, Jan Chrziciel's elder son, Apolinary Dąmbski, inherited Kaczkowo, while his younger son, Kazimierz (whose right to the title \\"Count Dombski\\" was recognized by the Prussian government in 1821) inherited Płonkowo. He died in 1833, leaving two daughters and a son, Stanislaw Kostka, who had no issue.Seweryn Uruski, Rodzina, Herbarz Szlachty Polskie, vol. III (Warsaw, Poland: Skład Głowny Księgarnia Gebethnera i Wolffa, 1906), p. 111 By 1887, the village was owned by Feliks Goczkowski. In 1887, Płonkowo had nine houses, and 143 inhabitants (of whom one was a Protestant), as well a vicarage consisting of two houses and 29 inhabitants. The village had an area of 377.80 hectares, of which 326.22 hectares were farms, 20.33 were meadow, 21.39 were pasture, 9.62 were wasteland, and 0.24 was water. A church dedicated to Maksymilian Maria Kolbe and the First Polish Martyrs is located in Płonkowo. The building was constructed in the 1980s, when the parish priest was Jozef Sołtysiak. The church contains the remains of Marian Skrzypczak, who was shot in Płonkowo in 1939 by Hitler youth, and was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1999.

Initially incorporated as a village on March 21, 2006, it was disincorporated on August 8, 2007, and incorporated again on February 5, 2008. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 279. The village is part of the Kankakee-Bradley Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Kankakee County. History =Failed incorporation= Sammons Point was first created in an effort to fend off the proposed expansion of the Waste Management Corporation's landfill. In March 2006, an incorporation election took place, with 82 people (66.7%) voting in favor of the measure and 41 (33.3%) voting against. Waste Management, which owned land within the new village, wanted all of their land to be unincorporated and under the jurisdiction of the Kankakee County Board instead of Sammons Point. They challenged the validity of the election in court, claiming that its organizers had not followed proper procedures when presenting their original incorporation petitions. The Circuit Court sided with Sammons Point, but Waste Management prevailed in a June 2007 appeal to the Third Appellate Court in Ottawa. A bid by the village for new hearing on the case was denied on August 8, 2007, and Sammons Point was formally disbanded on September 13. =Successful incorporation= Soon after, efforts to reincorporate the community were revived. A new incorporation election was held on February 5, 2008, with 87 votes (57.2%) cast in favor of reestablishing the village and 65 (42.8%) opposed. Approximately 76 percent of eligible voters participated in the election. At the November 2016 general election, Sammons Point held a referendum to dissolve, but the referendum was defeated, 30 to 127. Village government In August 2006, Mike Watson was named as the village's first mayor by a local court order. Six members were also appointed to serve on the Board of Trustees. They were Stephen Schuricht, Paul Gray, Robert Keller, Budd Meents, Clifford Schroeder and James Turner. Patrick Buescher was appointed to serve as village clerk. They held those positions until municipal elections were conducted in April 2007. In that poll, all of the appointed officials were formally elected. These positions were abolished on September 13, 2007, when Sammons Point was ordered to disband. Nearly four months after the February 5, 2008, incorporation vote, Circuit Court Judge James B. Kinzer restored Mike Watson to his previous post as mayor. He also named four former village officials and two who had opposed incorporation to the new Board of Trustees. They were Paul Becker, Pat Buescher, Bill Graham, Robert Keller, Budd Meents, and Stephen Schuricht. Becker and Graham were members of the \\"Concerned Citizens of Otto Township,\\" a group that opposed incorporation for the village. For the April 2009 Illinois consolidated election, the first after reincorporation, six names were on the ballot for village trustees -- Budd E. Meents (80 votes), Patrick Buescher (75), Stephen W. Schuricht (75), Clifford Schroeder (76), Robert Keller (74), and James Turner (80) -- with 147 write-in votes. Michael Watson ran unopposed for village president. Geography Sammons Point is in south-central Kankakee County, along U.S. Routes 45 and 52, south of Kankakee, the county seat, and northeast of Chebanse. It is bounded on the northeast by the Iroquois River, a north- flowing tributary of the Kankakee River. According to the 2010 census, Sammons Point has a total area of , all land. Demographics Education Sammons Point is served by the Central Community Unit School District 4 , which is based in the Iroquois County village of Clifton.
